Nursing homes are home to approximately 16% of people aged over 80 [1], most of whom are affected with multiple chronic conditions, cognitive and/or physical impairment and dependency regarding activities of daily living. Altho ugh the number of nursing homes has remained relatively stable in recent years , there is a tendency to reduce use of them, as increasing numbers of people have been opting for in- home care. About 26% of Swiss nursing homes are non -profit, 44% for -profit and 30% for -profit with public subsidies [2] . And while n ursing homes are regulated by the cantons, cantonal officials can delegate the associated tasks to individual communities. Within nursing homes, the grade -mix is approximately 30% registered nurses (tertiary level education) and nurse aides (short training), and 40% practical nurses (secondary level , with either 2, 3 or 4 years' education). Some cantons regulate either the number of personnel or the expected grade- mix per shift or both, by asking , e.g., that at least 15% of nursing personnel have a tertiary - level education. While the sheer increase in older persons in Switzerland will require 40 to 48% more care workers by 2030 [3] , the high number of older care workers in nursing homes [4] and early exits will both aggravate existing difficult ies in recruiting qualified personnel and strain resident safety efforts. Setting -specific characteristics of nursing homes Nursing homes have specific characteristics that influence the handling of safety issues and quality of care and distinguish them from acute -care hospital settings. A roundtable organized by Patient Safety Switzerland in 2016 defined a set of core characte ristics [5] that are also discussed in the international literature [6]. The nursing home is not only a place of care but also a home to its residents , where both safety and quality of life need to be in balance. In geriatric setting s, the main goal is for the residents to have the best possible quality of life within the given circumstances. Person -centred care that promotes residents' dignity and respects their values, preferences and autonomy in decision- making is the goal of a culture change taking place in nursing homes over the last decades. While some safety measures might not be acceptable to residents, since they restrict their autonomy and quality of life , then, others might be willingly considered. Residents' situations are often complex due to multimorbidity, dementia, polypharmacy, reduced mobility and behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). Frail older persons are particularly vulnerable . As thei r health condition can change quickly , early symptom recognition and provision of appropriate interventions are extremely important . This is especially true for residents with dementia, who depend on staff to observe changes and speak up for them. Nursing homes have high organizational heterogeneity , e.g., they use a wide range of staffing grade- mixes, physician models, pharmacy services and interfaces with other health care providers . This means no one-size-fits-all solutions exist for resident safety and quality issues. In addition, the field of long -term care is changing, with nursing homes diversify ing their offerings to include not only long -term care but also assisted living, day care and specialised rehabilitation, post-acute care, dementia and palliative care services . And the rising numbers of residents living Seite 3/11 with chronic illness calls for more - and increasingly advanced - long-term care technology , e.g. , for ventilated residents , or for special skills, e.g. for ageing psychiatric patients or those with disabilities who require constant care. Factors such as these multiply the complexity of resident safety - and quality -related issues . In terms of nursing home regulation, each Swiss canton is a distinct financial and/ or regulatory context. As a result, a multitude of financ ial constraints influence not only the allocation of personnel resources , e.g., to monitor risk and quality manag ement activities, but also any other attempts to develop practice and introduce innovations . One solution is to seek external funding for nursing home quality improvement projects. However, finding contributors - whether governmental or private - to fund projects require s high levels of time, motivation and skill . Safety and quality of care in nursing homes In the context of nursing homes, typical resident safety and quality of care issues include fall s, drug-related adverse events, healthcare -associated infections, avoidable hospitalizations, delirium, pain, weight loss, and pressure ulcers, as well as the use of physical restraints or the experience of physical, verbal or sexual aggression from either residents or staff. Additionally, promoting residents' quality of life and the experience of person -centred care are key markers of high-quality nursing homes. While most of these issues have been examined in the Swiss context, national data remain scarce. One data source was the Swiss Nursing Homes Human Resources Project (SHURP) , a national study in 163 nursing homes . SHURP reported prevalence rates of 1.7% pressure ulcers acquired in the nursing home at the time of data collection, with 2.0% of residents having sustained fall- related injuries and 5.1% having contracted urinary tract infections over the previous 30 days [4]. Additionally, 31.8% of care workers reported observing verbal resident -to-resident aggre ssion several times per week, with 7.2% reporting physical aggression, 1.6% noting incidents of sexual aggression by residents . Roughly 10% had witnessed elder abuse more than monthly in the form of verbal or emotional abuse and neglect by staff [4]. In addition, a recent nation- wide pilot study of quality indicators in 152 Swiss nursing homes reported prevalence rates of 3.6% for use of physical restraint s, 13.5% for use of bedrails, 7.3% for weight loss, 43.3% for polypharmacy, 18.4% for self -assessed severe pain and 12.0 % for observed severe pain [7]. Several regional or local studies reported further prevalence rates regarding, e.g., physical restraints, pressure ulcers, aggression, delirium and administration of antipsychotic medication [8-12]. Overall, Swiss nursing homes show clinical outcome rates comparable to those reported internationally ; however, the data indicate high inter -home variances in quality of care, with considerable room for improvement among low performers [4, 12] . However, as nursing homes provide both medical and social care, with the ultimate goal of maintaining their residents' quality of life, their s afety and quality need to be viewed in a context that includes more than clinical quality. Accordingly, user reports regarding person- centred care, care coordination, and general quality of life are key aspects of quality in long-t erm care [ 13]. While little is known regarding these variables in Swiss nursing homes , when one national study interviewed residents in 51 nursing homes, 71% rated their overall quality of life as good. Still, while giving privacy and dignity high ratings , residents did not perceive their care to be person- centred [14] : Instead, only 33% noted that care workers' showed interest in the their lives , leading to a general lack of trustful relationships or even meaningful conversations between staff and Seite 4/11 residents . Such a common result cannot be attribute d solely to caregiver -level failure s; it must be viewed systemically, from a n organization- and policy -level perspective. Quality improvement in nursing homes Currently , most interventions to reduce harm and improve nursing homes' quality of care are conducted at the level of individual institutions [5]. As a result, many homes develop care guidelines and standards (e.g. , for hygiene, pain, falls), introduce preventive measures, initiate interprofessional projects (e.g. , with pharmacies for medication safety), implement critical incident reporting systems on an institution -specific basis [5] or start culture change projects. Occasionally they collaborate with external research partners like universities of applied sciences or private firms that conduct staff or resident/family surveys to provide data for i nternal safety and quality improvement. Several country -wide programs also cover nursing home safety and quality issues. For example, the National Dementia S trategy promotes the development and implementation of needs -oriented health care services , care coordination and interprofessional collaboration. In addition to increasing dementia- relevant knowledge and skills, it support s informal caregivers and promotes new models of care and data monitoring [15]. Similarly, the N ational Strategy for Palliative Care fosters quality of care in end- of-life situations , including the implementation of advance care planning , taking into account residents' values and preferences [16]. The strategy against healthcare-associated infections (NOSO) is aimed at reduc ing nosocomial infections in hospitals and nursing homes [17] . Similarly, the Federal Office of Health has produced an action plan to support informal caregivers and initiated two project s: one to coordinate care (focusing current ly on very old, polymorbid persons ); and another to implement eHealth with an electronic health record for patients . And t he Swiss Academy of Medical Sciences (SAMS) offers broad support to improve both the quantity and the quality of interprofessional care. All of these examples address important aspects of safety and quality of care among frail, older persons - key themes of an integrated extended care service. From 2019 onwards, based on Article 59a of the Swiss Health Insurance Act, nursing homes will be obliged to provide the relevant federal agencies with data about the quality of their medical care. Six national quality indicators will be publicly reported. For the first time , this will include national -level data on quality of care indicators concerning four measurement themes in Swiss nursing homes: use of physical restraints, weight loss, polypharmacy and pain. These indicators address important safety themes and should incentivize nursing home managers to address them if necessary; however, as shown above, these indicators do not represent the overall quality of nursing home quality . As q uality measurement is both administered and supported at the cantonal level , several ask nursing homes to report regularly on safety and quality themes, including structures and processes related to safety and quality of care. Some cantonal health authorities ask nursing homes to carry out surveys of staff and residents/families and to perform audits; and a number of cantons are initiating projects to evaluate and develop nursing homes' safety and quality. Key themes in nursing home safety and quality of care Experts on a roundtable organized by the Swiss Patient Safety Foundation identified several areas where improvements would be possible and necessary to reduce physical as well as emotional Seite 5/11 harm , while extending independence in activities of daily living [5]. A similar roundtable of Canadian experts indicated very similar themes [6]. These will be explored in the following paragraphs . The various medical professionals who provide care to nursing home residents need to have a common understanding of each resident's situation, wishes and values, as well as a common goal upon which to base intervention planning. Interprofessional collaboration, which provides a comprehensive assessment of the resident's situation and its management options, and coordination of care are key themes for improving quality of care. Moreover, care should be planned in collaboration with residents and families . Advance care planning helps to clarify each resident's preferences and values in order to focus care on what is important to the resident. One major hurdle is the coordination of transitions between health care settings . When residents move between settings, be it from home to nursing home or from nursing home to hospital and back, fragmentation of information and failures of information flow commonly lead to conflicting information and missing details , thereby increas ing the risk of errors. Residents are not only exposed to higher risks of medication errors or rehospitalisation, but also often feel distressed. The obvious solution is to provide t imely , transparent and complete communication. This would be supported via the adoption of electronic health records (EHRs). A lthough EHRs will be introduced in Switzerland by 2020, general practitioners, who are key providers for nursing home residents, will not be obliged to work with them [18], which might hinder a complete documentation of resident health data. Medication safety in nursing homes focuses on reduc ing adverse drug reactions, improving prescribing practices regarding potentially inadequate medications (PIM s), antibiotics and polypharmacy and promoting safe medication prescribing, dispensing and monitoring processes . In 2017, the Swiss Patient Safety Foundation launched a program focusing on polypharmacy and the use of PIMs in nursing homes [19]. In a recent survey, they confirmed that the current high level of organizational heterogeneity , which includes the use of various physician and pharmacy model s, impedes care providers' efforts to maintain medication safety. Problems identified included missing prescriptions at admission, lack of continuity, poorly -structured systems of medication review and adverse event monitoring, and lack of relevant pharmacological knowledge among nu rsing home staff [19]. Address ing polypharmacy and PIM use will dem and interprofessional collaboration. Projects in the French part of Switzerland have showed that collaborative pharmacy practice models reduce polypharmacy and costs without affecting quality of care [20, 21] . Currently, researchers on the National Research Programm e 74 (NRP74) \"Smarter Health Care\" project are developing and introducing an interprofessional deprescribing process in the Cantons of Vaud and Fribourg. Insights from these projects might help to identify and implement interventions fit for the Swiss context. Additionally, the Swiss Patient Safety Foundation is launching a project for safe medication in nursing homes, addressing both polypharmacy and PIMs. One serious knowledge gap involves the lack of data on infections in Swiss nursing homes. While the national NOSO strategy is intended to reduce healthcare- associated infections (HAI s) in hospitals and nursing homes , the StAR strategy addresses treatment -resistant microbes . For nursing homes , although it is likely that key themes will echo international findings, with urinary tract and respiratory tract infections being the most common, fulfilling these strategies' goals will require compiling baseline surveillance data [22] . Although Swiss data on antimicrobial resistance in nursing homes is not available nation- wide, it is known that multi -drug resistant organism s Seite 6/11 (MDROs) are increasingly prevalent [23]. However, since nursing homes are a residential environment and financing does not provide for acute care interventions, prolonged isolation precautions are unrealistic and inefficient [22] . Nursing home -specific evidence- based intervention guidelines such as those provided by four cantons in Switzerland's French- speaking region (https://www.hpci.ch ) will be necessary . Key interventions are staff education, promotion of hand hygiene and influenza vaccination, as well as the designat ion of persons responsible for infection control - all of these support the goal of reduc ing HAIs [24]. Although international guidelines are available for a broad array of nursing home themes, with certain notable exceptions, such as those on the handling of BPSD [25], few have been developed in any of Switzerland's major languages . Producing a single set of nursing home guidelines directly relevant to each Swiss linguistic context and supported by empirical evidence on best practices will save individual institutions the time and expense of developing guidelines of their own. Moreover, nursing homes need support in implementing, monitoring and optimizing such guidelines, especially smaller ones without the corresponding resources. Adequate staffing is essential for the tasks at hand. Recruiting problems particularly affect highly qualified staff and strain s their ability to manage complex situations inv olving frail older persons, e.g., in relation to a comprehensive assessment, interprofessional collaboration, shared care planning, chronic disease management, end- of-life care, or medication and wound management. It is vital to distribute tasks between professions according to competencies : the grade -mix has to reflect the care needed by the residents. Additionally, high turnover rates pose a threat to safety : knowledge of processes, standards and guidelines can easily be lost , along with the long- term, trusting relationships that form the core of person- centred care and that allow care staff to recognize changes in residents' health . Care workers in Swiss nursing homes report rationing of care, especially in the area of social activities, emotional support and rehabilitation, when under time pressure [26]. This is not without effect on residents, who suffer from the emotional detachment and inattentiveness of care workers under stress [27]. A Swiss initiative addressing this problems is the Competence Network Health Workforce, a collaborative project shared by five univer sities of applied sciences, is to develop strategies to counter staff shortages among health professionals in Switzerla nd (https://www.cnhw.ch/ ). Further challenge s include language barriers between staff and residents , particularly when less qualified personnel are not fluent in the residents' language. This hinders the affected staff members' understanding not only of residents' needs and symptoms , but of their supervisors' instructions and orders. A key factor for sta ff retention and the securing of safe care is a positive work environment [28, 29] . To be able to handle complex resident situations, nursing homes need staff with expertise in geriatric, gerontological, gerontopsychiatric or pharmaceutical fields . According to the international literature, advanced practice nurses (AP Ns) are effective at increasing quality across a variety of themes , e.g., pain management, alternatives to physical restraints , avoidance of unnecessary hospitalizations and resident satisfaction with care [30-32]. In the Swiss context, where APN education is a recent development, the current shortage of APNs requires adaptive solutions, suc h as providing registered nurses with in-depth training to fill out expert roles with competencies corresponding to their educational level. In the context of the NRP 74 \"Smarter Health Care\", INTERCARE is a research project to develop and evaluate a nurse -led nursing home care model, placing nurses with expanded geriatric expertise in clinical leadership roles, with the aim of reduc ing avoidable hospitalisations and improving the quality of care [33]. To perform their tasks fully, all s taff must receive all necessary education and training regarding nursi ng home- specific safety issues, including risk assessment of the physical and social Seite 7/11 environment, clinical signs , symptoms and first reactions, handling of aggression, handling of technical equipment and performance of infection control procedures . Moreover, it is important to support staff in offering person -centred care, maintaining residents' dignity and privacy and building meaningful relationships. As not all training can be offered by the nursing homes themselves , any outstanding themes will need to be taken up by educational institutions that specialize in nursing homes and elderly care. In all cases, t raining will need to match the learners' various educational levels and cultural backgrounds, while integrat ing an interprofessional approach wherever possible. An important theme to tackle is elder abuse, which needs to be addressed as soon as observed to avoid a growing tolerance of abusive staff behaviour. One Swiss study reported that education and training was an important first step in addressing the issue, together with timely intervention, active management and providing a positive work environment with less work stress and the possibility of staff rotation in difficult resident situations [34]. Both the Unabh\u00e4ngige Beschwerdestelle f\u00fcr das Alter (Independent Complaint Centre for the Aged) in Zurich (http://www.uba.ch/ ) or Alter Ego in the (French- speaking) Romandy region ( https://alter - ego.ch/ ) are important external contact points for staff, residents and famili es in challenging situations. A positive safety culture treats errors as situations to learn from. The introduction of a critical incident reporting system (CIRS) can support learning from mistakes. However, many nursing homes in Switzerland are too small to profit from a system of their own and regional CIRS s are not yet available. Additionally, little is known about how nursing homes handle either internal errors or the disclosure of those errors to residents and their families. Leaders are key to creating a culture of safety and improving safety and quality of care. Before they can do that, though, they need to understand both which structures and processes are relevant to safety and quality of care and how they can promote those processes . They need the training to link management practices and safety [35] . Moreover, they are key persons in promoting a culture of person- centeredness, where residents' dignity and autonomy are uphold. Implementation science research , which evaluates interventions in the real world while exploring barriers, facilitators and effective implementation strategies, is still rare in the Swiss nursing home context. We miss projects that explore the improvement of resident safety and quality of care with independent measures of clinical and quality of life outcomes, in -depth assessment of staf fing resources, system information about regulatory and payment context s, as well as physician and pharmacy services [36] . One starting point is the NRP 74 \"Smarter Health Care \" with projects that focus on nursing homes. More research is needed to provide a firmer evidence base for improving resident safety and quality of care . Recommendations For all themes a common effort on all levels - from decision makers, professional organizations, provider organizations, nursing home management, to staff, residents and family - is necessary to improve and maintain patient safety and quality of care.

In 2017, Swiss home care firms logged 16 million hours, with 73% of their clients 65 years or older , and more than half of their patient care time provided to clients aged over 80 [1, 2] . Two main types of home care services are available: nursing and domestic. While the former is physician- prescribed and covered by health insurance, the latter is either paid for directly by the clients or via complementary insurance. In Switzerland, services are offered partly by non- profit home care organizations, which represent 30% of all organizations, but cover more than 80% of home care clients [1] . However , for-profit organisations and independent nurses are increasing in terms both of numbers and of services offered [1]. In addition, firms offering 24/7 care schedules often enlist care migrants , many of whom work in grey legal areas with long working hours and short rest periods [3]. As the demand for home care grows, it is increasingly difficult to recruit enough qualified care workers to cover staffing needs [4]. The home care workforce currently consists of 42% registered nurses, 29% licensed practical nurses or home care nurse aides (2-3- year education with certificate or attest), and 29% aides with either short training courses or no specific qualifications . By 2030, projections indicate that the home care work force will have to grow by 57% to meet demand; and while this will equal almost 8' 200 fulltime equivalent positions, a shortage of registered nurses is virtually c ertain [5]. The resultant shortfall of expertise poses a risk to both safety and quality of care. Adverse events in home care According to a review, between 3.5 and 15% of home care clients experience care- related adverse events [6]. Among these, the most frequent were falls , fall-related injuries and adverse drug events [7-10]. Other typical adverse events in the home care setting include wounds, infections (e.g. , pneumonia, urinary tract infections), line -related (e.g. , catheter -related blood stream infection or catheter site infections) or technology -related adverse events (e.g. , home ventilator failure ). Accor ding to a Canadian study, self - or informal caregiving is a contributing factor to in over half of adverse events in home care settings [7]. A recent Swedish record review study considered almost three quarters of the reviewed adverse events preventable [11]. To date, no corresponding surveys exist for Switzerland. Setting -specific challenges to safety and quality of care Maintaining safety and quality of care for frail older people at home has its specific challenges: unlike in institutional care, informal carers often carry the main burden of care in an environment not pri marily built for healthcare provision [12] . In untrained or inexperienced hands, medical technology can also be problematic : increasingly, medical devices that find their way into clients ' homes actually function as obstacles to safe care [13]. Formal care workers spend only a limited time in clients' homes, doing assessments, providing care and consulting the clients and their families, with no control over what happens between their visits. Clients decide autonomously about the services provided in their home [14] . Informal caregivers often work around the clock seven days a week ; such heavy care burdens are linked with fatigue and might increase the risk of errors . On the other hand, informal caregivers have intimate knowledge of the client and perform Seite 3/10 informal coordination work, increasing care safety [15]. Overall, though, top-level quality and safety can only be achieved via partnerships between formal care workers, clients and their families [14, 16, 17]. In addition to clients' care needs, these teams' decisions consider clients' and their families' physical and cognitive competencies , financial resources, reading skills , and social and environmental context s [18]. Formal home care workers also face different challenges than their colleagues in institutional settings . They work mostly alone, with only on- call support from a central office [18], but no on- site collegial support. With contact with physicians limited mostly to phone call s, they often have to make on -the-spot decisions in critical situations [18] . Moreover, if needed medical supplies or equipment are not available, it may be necessary to improvise on -the-spot solutions [16] . For each client, based on a physician's prescription, health insurance companies assign a number of hours they will provide for nursing services ; and while some flexibility is built into this system , the time is limited. Nurses are under pressure to work within the limits of the time covered and sometimes have to cut short the time needed for risk assessments, discussion of preventive measures, consultation and patient education, all of which would be especially important for frail older persons with multiple chronic conditions and complex care needs. Moreover, the less-trained care workers who are mainly present in the home might not recognize earl y signs of cogniti ve or functional impairment. Such shortfalls exacerbate the effects of chronic diseases or environmental hazards, further impact ing the safety and quality of care provided. In a recent review of safety guidelines for home health care [14], the authors suggested eight safety themes for home -care setting s: communication and interaction, integration of client and family, risk assessment, medication management, qualification, medical assisting devices, hygiene/ infection control, and establishing a safety culture. Similar themes arose from an expert roundtable organized by the Swiss Patient Safety Foundations [19] . These wil l be the topic of the following paragraphs, which will first highlight several hotspots in home care safety and quality , then discus s structural and procedural aspects important to safe care. Issues in safety and quality of care Home care clients are exposed to a wide variety of risks , all of which must be assessed before beginning a plan for service and integrated in -home care. Assessment s address risks both within the physical and social environment and clinical risks (e.g. fall -related injuries, pressure ulcer s). As for physical risks , older frail persons living at home are subject not only to increased risk from environmental hazards such as unsanitary conditions (e.g. , insects, rodents), poor air quality (e.g. , mold , peeling paint), unhealthy room temperatures, pet -related hazards , or unsafe neighbourhoods [20], but also from barriers to mobility such as uneven floors or tight spaces, poor lighting, and electrical, chemical, and fire hazards [13] . A safety hazard assessment supports clients and their families to recognize and tackle unnoticed risks [21]. Older frail pe rsons are also subject to risks in the social environment . These include physical, emotional, or sexual abuse, financial exploitation and neglect. An estimated 10% of older persons experience one or more of these forms of abuse [22]. Internationally, the main victim -level risk factors are functional dependence, poor physical health, cognitive impairment, low mental health and low income. One protective factor is social support [23]. A survey in northern Switzerland showed psychological abuse to be most frequent, followed by financial and physical abuse [24] . Perpetrators were most at risk when overburdened, living with and dependent on the victim s [24]. Overall, an interprofessional, community -based approach, including not only healthcare professionals but also community resources and policy makers, is key to address ing the problem Seite 4/10 of abuse [22, 24] . Alongside support interventions to relieve caregiver burden, telephone helplines for victims or perpetrators, including the Unabh\u00e4ngige Beschwerdestelle f\u00fcr das Alter (Independent Complaint Centre for the Aged) in Zurich ( http://www.uba.ch/ ) or Alter E go Romandy region ( https://alter -ego.ch/ ) are both promising approaches . As for clinical risks, this report takes as an example the most frequent adverse event in home care: falls, which often lead to hospitalizations and eventually to nursing home admission. Responding to a national survey in 2015, one- quarter of respondents over 65 and living at home reported falling at least once in the previous 12 months [25]. A main risk factor is frailty , which often includes reduced muscle strength and disturbances to the subject's gait and equilibrium [26]. As falls most commonly have multifactorial causes, a careful, interdisciplinary assessment is often necessary to prevent further incidents [26]. While evidence supports multi- component interventions including exercise to reduce fall rates among older persons [27], a Swiss research team concluded that frail persons need such programs to be adapted to their specific circumstances [28]. In Switzerland, the Beratungsstelle f\u00fcr Unfallverh\u00fctung (BFU: The Swiss Competence and Coordination Center for Accident Prevention) launched a fall prevention program in 2016 to motivate senior citizens toward strength and gait training, including specific exercises for those with functional impairment ( http://www.sichergehen.ch/ ). Ideally , in addition to regular updates regarding clinical risks and their influencing factors, home care workers will be able to perform evidence- based risk assessment s and interventions in an interdisciplinary context that includes clients and their families. Drug -related problems (DRPs, encompassing adverse drug reactions and medication errors) are among the most frequent patient safety risks in home care- more so than in institutional setting s [29]. Within this group, potentially inappropriate medications and medication errors are both common, with respective prevalences of 20-48% and 17- 41%. Specific problems identified were medication discrepancies based on inconsistent information sources, problems with the medication management continuum , as well as medication preparation and dispens ing errors, for example, inappropriate splitting of tablets. Adverse drug events were found in 8- 45% of cases, with drug interactions in 10- 57% [29] . Older polypharmacological persons bear a particularly high risk for DRPs. Based on the above- cited review, the Swiss research team identified five safety hotspots: transitions from hospital to home with insufficient discharge instructions and discrepancies in medication lists, lack of regular medication reviews, use of sev eral healthcare providers with insufficient interprofessional collaboration and communication, informal caregivers and the clients themselves [29]. In line with Canadian guidelines for home care [21], that study's authors recommend introduc ing clinical pharmacy services to perform medication reviews in cooperation with clients and informal caregivers during critical periods such as transition s from hospital to home. In fact, transitions from hospital to home represent a specific set of safety risks . In a study in the Canton of Lucerne [30], three specific problems were identified in relation to medication safety: prescriptions were often either unavailable or ambiguous at the first home care visit ; communication was incomplete and medications unavailable when clients were at home, partly due to a regional system allowing physicians to dispense medications. The \"doMESTIC Study of medication safety in home care\" -a project current ly shared between the City of Lucerne and the University of Basel (2016- 2020), addresses three issues: communication, medication availability and the quality of physician prescriptions [31]. In addit ion, the implementation of clinical pharmacy services such as medication reconciliation at transition of care and an electronic health record accessible to all professional healthcare providers would support information exchange. Patient Seite 5/10 Safety Switzerland lead a National Program for Medication Safety approaching the problem from the hospital side via systematic medication review s at hospital admission and discharge [32] . Moreover, international literature emphasizes the importance of nurses monitoring possible medication safety problems during their visits, providing clients with the information and, where necessary, tailoring the technology to support medication preparation and adherence [18]. Acquiring infections in home care is another common risk for older frail persons. A key intervention to reduce the risk of healthcare -associated infections is compliance with hand hygiene guidelines and the corresponding training of all care workers [21, 33]. Another is the tracking of healthcare- associated infections (HAI s) [21]. While a national strategy is in play to examine HAIs in hospital and nursing home settings, ambulatory and home care setting s have yet to be integrated [34] . However, a preliminary study ind icated an overall lack of data about HAI s in these settings and the lack not only of systematic control s but of guidelines and standards [34] . Contextual factors related to safety and quality of care A major risk factor concerning safe formal care is the lack of qualified care workers and the concomitant lack of comprehensive assessment, timely detection of deterioration, or preventive measures. Additionally, to achieve safe care, staff need continuous training and education in safety issues such as medication safety, hand hygiene, risk assessment, prevention of harmful events and the building of partnerships with clients and their families. This includes the training of care migrants , who may be in danger of working beyond their competencies. Since some interventions are not frequently offered, an update in knowledge and skills training is needed to ensure their safe delivery [16] , esp ecially in view of the increasing use of assistive technology . The establishment of a safety culture is essential to safe care. In addition to developing awareness regarding safety issues, this includes increasing knowledge about how to disclose, handle and learn from patient safety incidents . Since 2017, non -profit home care organizations in Switzerland have been invited to share knowledge via the Critical Incident Reporting System (CIRS ) platform [35] . On the other hand, as each organization is accountable for t he quality of care it delivers, it is also necessary to monitor its quality and guide its improvement . Both of these tasks require the tracking of quality indicators and feedback from clients and families [21]. Several organizations in Switzerland , including Concret AG, sanaCERT, QUALIS evaluation or NPO Plus, support healthcare providers in assessing their quality or surveying clients. And for this to work, the leadership of each home care organization must start with a coherent vision regarding safety issues and quality of care, then implement structures and processes that support quality issues and finally steer the organization accordingly. The lack of communication and care coordination between different healthcare providers, including physicians, insurance companies, pharmacies, specialists, therapists and community - based programs, the variety of unlinked documentation systems and the fragmentation of information all disrupt the continuum of healthcare provision, threatening patient safety and quality [16]. A central repository of care plans, medications and patient information would facilitate both safe home health care and transition management. Switzerland is in the process of introducing Electronic Health Records to all regions by 2020 [36] . However, as its use is voluntary for patients as well as for general practitioners and outpatient services, it has had a slow start. One specific hotspot is the transition home from a hospital stay Seite 6/10 with missing information [37]. In Geneva, it could be shown that an integrated care model with a multidisciplinary geriatric home visit team that regularly exchanged information with the home care services could reduce unnecessary hospitalizations and emergency room visits [38] . As shown above, clients and families need not only to be included in the discourse about patient safety in home care, but also to be partners in identifying safety risk and making decisions about possible interventions. This includes the building up of a trustful relationship between client, family and nurses, the provision of supporting information to those who need it and the r esources for patient safety and quality education. Technology is increasingly important in home care [12], from monitoring systems, oxygen or infusion therapy to home dialysis apparatus and ventilators. Technology can greatly assist informal caregivers, e.g. , with alarm systems, motion sensors or sound monitors , to keep clients safe. However, often both clients and their caregivers can have physical, cognitive or sensory impairments that hinder that technology's safe use [13] . Moreover , constant alarms day and night can lead to fatigue, increasing safety risk s [39]. Thus, to use assistive devices efficiently, informal caregivers need not only knowledge, skills and abilities , but safet y awareness . Above all, t he introduction of home care technology requires consideration of human factors that could hinder safe care [13]. The Interdisciplinary Centre of Competence for Ageing (IKOA ) at the University of Applied Sciences in St. Gallen tes ts, adapts and support s the safe introduction of new technology by setting up Living Labs for older persons in their own homes. Quality measurement and improvement Based on Article 59a of the Swiss Health Insurance Act, all health care providers are obliged to provide federal agencies with any data needed to monitor their quality of care. In 2008, based on data from the Resident Assessment Instrument - Home Care Version (RAI -HC), 19 quality indicators were developed for Swiss home care setting s. These included pertinent safety themes such as falls, no medication review, skin ulcers and informal caregiver distress [40]. However, to date, no federal agencies have either collect ed such data or publicly report ed quality of care indicators . Spitex Schweiz, the national organization of non -profit home care agencies, provides the HomeCareData IT platform, which allows their members to anonymously upload their data, monitor their performance and compare themselves with other agencies . It is currently used by roughly 74 organizations. In the context of the National Research Program 74, the national \"Better data on the quality of home care\" project is refining HomeCareData. This will both develop a measurement for client and family satisfaction and update existing quality indicators. As cantonal governments can define quality standards for home care organizations in the context of operating approvals and continuous quality monitoring, they play a key role in quality assurance . Some cantons not only define minimal requirements but also regularly monitor or audit the fulfilment of structural and procedural requirements. Additionally, the national organizations of both non-profit and for -profit home care organizations offer instrument s that support their members in assessing their quality. How ever, as no national standards for home care organizations exist , inter- cantonal variability is high concerning quality standards and the allocation of financial resources to work on projects. Moreover, few evidence- based guidelines exist regarding safety issues in home care [14, 41]. Many projects to improve safety and quality of care run on the level either of single home care agencies or of collaborations between home care agencies. The degree of investment depends on each involved agenc y's size, structure and offers , as well as on its leaders ' commitment to quality management. Seite 7/10 Recommendations All stakeholders can contribute at different levels to better quality of care and patient safety. While the recommendations are here assigned to specific stakeholders, most of them can be taken up by several stakeholders.

To prevent, identify or treat these geriatric syndromes, comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA), consisting of screening, in -depth assessment, integrat ed care planning and follow -up, has been put forward for delivering high quality care for these frail older patients. CGA as a multicomponent intervention has been included as core intervention in different care models. Although acute geriatric units have the strongest evidence- base and are therefore still the golden standard in geriatric hospital care, they are more expensive in terms of infrastructure and require more geriatric expertise. As a result, alternative CGA based care models have been implemented and evaluated. The geriatric co - management models based on proactive and collaborative care have stronger evidence than the purely consultation- based models and should therefore be favoured . It is unclear to what extent the different models have been implemented in Swiss hospitals. Research has shown that having a legislative framework and having sufficient capacity in terms of geriatric expertise are key in moving implementation of these care models forward. Yet, although the number of geriatric beds and geriatricians has been increasing in Switzerland, it seems that the growth is insufficient to keep up with the demographic ageing. Investments in the development of guiding frameworks and geriatric training for all medical and allied health professionals should be prioritized, while hospital administrators locally push the implementation forward. Increasing number of older people in the hospital Improvements in living conditions and progress in medical and surgical management have caused progressive ageing of the population in developed countries (1). The EU predicts that by 2060, between 22 and 36% of all citizens will be 65 years, with 12% of EU citizens being 80 years (2). In Switze rland the population aged 65 years is expected to increase from 18% i n 2016 to 28% in 2060 (3). Although gains in life expectancy can be considered a positive outcome, not all the newly -won years will be spent i n good health and free of physical limitations. Older adults are incr easingly faced with disability and chronic illness es, such as diabetes, hypertension and dementia (4). In Switzerland one quarter of the people between 65-79 year and 40% o f the people aged 80 years suffer from two or more chronic diseases (5). Subsequently, as the annual likelihood of hospitalisation for people aged 65 years is more than three times that of someone aged 45 to 64 years, the hospital population will age as well (6). In 2017, 35.2% of all hospitalized patients in Switzerland were 65 years or older, with 36.7% of them being hospitalized at least twice (7). The goal of this report to give a brief 2 overview of the current evidence reviewing the international literature and practice with a view to identifying areas for further optimizing care for frail older people in the hospital. Comprehensive geriatric care for frail older people The hospital is a high- risk environment f or older people, especially th ose who are frail , meaning that they have a reduction in physiologic reserve with higher rates of comorbidity and disability (8). Frail older patients are at higher risk for developing geriatric syndromes, such as delirium, functional decline, cognitive impairment, acute continence, malnutrition, falls, and pressure ulcers, both during and after hospitalization, compared to non -frail patients (9, 10) . Consequently , ageing is also associated with prolonged hospital stay, discharge to an increased care level, rehabilitation, nursing home admission, and hospital readmission (11). To ensure the early detection and accurate management of geriatric syndromes and determining the best treatment of older patients, comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) has been recommended by researchers and societies both nationally and internationally . CGA has been defined as \"a multidimensional interdisc iplinary diagnostic process focused on determining a frail older person's medical, psychological and functional capability in order to develop a coordinated and integrated plan for treatment and long term follow up\" (12). It is considered to be one of the cornerstones of modern high-quality geriatric care. This geriatric care pathway originates from the observation that in frail older patients many conditions are unrecognised or misdiagnosed, either by lack of attention or by misinterpreting atypical disease presentations, leading to poorer outcomes after acute hospital admission (12). The key point is that conventional medical care focuses mainly on the disease of prese ntation and too often offers a 'one size fits all' approach. CGA on the other hand encompasses a holistic picture of the patient and offers individualised care by a multidisciplinary team with expertise in geriatric care (13, 14) . CGA includes four consecutive steps or core components: screening, assessment, integrated care planning and follow -up. Because in- depth evaluation with CGA is of most benefit in frail older patients, CGA should be preceded by a risk or frailty screening with a standardised screening test or questi onnaire in order to target the population at risk for adverse outcomes in the hospital and post - discharge. Such an approach saves efforts and resources (15) . Several validated screening instruments have been recommended for sy stematic screening of older adults in the hospital, such as the Identification for Seniors At Risk , the Triage Risk Screening Tool , the interRAI ED Screener or the Edmonton Frail Scale. Although the overall predictive accuracy of all these instruments is moderate , their sensitivity and negative predictive value is good. However, because of their poor specificity, screening tests alone are not sufficient to conclude that all patients who are rated as at risk are actually in need of further CGA. Although, thi s is one of the limitations of this type of screening, it is still recommended as a necessary first s tep because 1) it allows to efficiently exclude patients who are not at risk and 2) it increases the awareness about geriatric care aspects in those conduc ting the screening. Alternatively, one can define the at risk population by clearly describing the target population, e.g. all patients with a traumatic hip fracture aged 75 years or older, or all patients aged 75 years or older who had an unplanned readmi ssion within 30 days after hospital discharge. This approach is often used for determining who can be admitted to a geriatric ward or an orthogeriatric ward. Second, an in-depth geriatric assessment of the at -risk patients should be conducted . This comprehensive assessment is not limited to a medical evaluation or clinical assessment , but also includes the evaluation of the cognitive and functional abilities, the mental status, and the social and environmental context of the older person. Also inform al caregiver burden, the 3 need to discuss advance care planning and the patient's preferences and care goals are to be assessed (16). As the assessment of all these domains requires expertise of different health and social care disciplines, this assessment can be conducted by several members of the multidis ciplinary geriatric team. Validated geriatric scales and instruments are used to assess the patients' baseline status and detect unidentified problems and specific geriatric syndromes , such as the Confusion Assessment Method to assess delirium, the Geriatr ic Depression Scale to assess depression, the Katz or Barthel Index to assess activities of daily living and the Timed Get up and Go test to assess mobility and risk for falls , among many others . Based on the in -depth and holistic geriatric assessment a coordinated and integrated care plan including tailored interventions to implement in clinical practice needs to be formulated (16, 17) . In surgical patients, pre -operative CGA delivers important information for preoperative optimisation of health and social issues and to set rehabilitation goals. It also aids in prevention (e.g. delirium prevention), risk stratification, estimation of residual life expectancy, and preoperative shared decision making (15 -18). Post -operatively , CGA aids to timely recognise acute complications or delayed recovery, to manage complications and comorbidities, to successfully r ehabilitate, and to prepare for successful hospital discharge (18, 19) . Lastly, after implementation of the care plan with all health and social care providers, a follow - up should be foreseen, with the frequency and duration of the follow -up depending on the number, type and complexity of the identified problems. Although the practical implementation of care models for frail older people is context -specific, these four steps are considered evidence- based core interventions in all settings to impact safety and quality of care for frail older people in the hospital . CGA based care models for f rail older people in the hospital Different types of care models based on the CGA -approach have been described in the literature and have been implemented in daily clinical practice. The acute geriatric unit is a defined medical unit that has been designed specifically to prevent functional decline and related complications in frail older adults admitted to the hospital for an acute event (20) . An interdisciplinary care approach based on CGA, patient -centered care, frequent medical review, early rehabilitation to maximizing functional status, proactive discharge planning and an adapted infrastructure are core components of acute geriatric wards (21, 22) . Several meta- analyses have shown that admission on an acute geriatric unit prevents in- hospital functional decline, decreases mortality and institutionalization rates and results in shorter length of stays, a lower incidence of delirium, fewer falls, more discharges to home and lower costs (22 -24). Because of the repeatedly show n impact on clinical and system outcomes, acute geriatric care units are still considered the gold standard for delivering high quality of care to hospitalized frail older people. Inpatient geriatric consultation teams (IGCT) are mobile multidisciplinary teams that evaluate older patients at risk for functional decline or acute complications hospitalized on non -geriatric wards (25, 26) . The team members make their extensive geriatric expertise available for other professionals working in non -geriatric nursing units by formulating care commendations, developing an evidence- based care plan, and/ or providing bed- side education (27) . Because acute geriatric units have been and still are increasingly being tested to the limits of their capacity, these consultation teams are attractive because they can reach a large number of frail older patients and can be 4 implemented in a short period of time (28). They are also seen as an efficient way to bring in geriatric expertise, given the lack of geriatricians and geriatric expert nurses in many Western countries (29). Although a meta- analysis could only show a beneficial effect of IGCT interv entions on mortality rate up to 8 months post -discharge, individual studies also demonstrated improved functional outcomes, decreased incidence of delirium, and decreased readmi ssion rates in patients seen by the IGCT (25). Compared to acute geriatric wards, t he effectiveness is limited, mainly because of the recommendation -based character of the care model, the rather reactive than proactive approach, and the low adherence to the proposed interventions (23, 25, 27) . Research and clinical focus has therefore shifted towards co- management models (15, 30) . Geriatric co- management models are characterized by direct proactive care and shared responsibility and decision- making between at least one primary treating physician and a geriatrician or interdisciplinary geriatric team in the prevention and management of geriatric -oriented problems (31, 32) . In a recent meta- analysis including 12 prospective quasi -experimental studies a potential beneficial effect on complications, length of stay and in- hospital m ortality was demonstrated (30) . The majority of these studies had been conducted in surgical, mainly orthopedic, patients. One example of geriatric co- management is the Proactive care of Older People undergoing Surgery (POPS) program , a multidisciplinary preoperative CGA service with post -operative follow -through, which has proven successful in improving postoperative outcomes (33) . In non- surgical patients, a recent effectiveness - implementation evaluation of the 'G eriatric CO-mAnagement Cardiology patients in the Hospital (G -COACH)' program has shown that the geriatric co-management intervention resulted in decrease of in -hospital functional (34% vs. 3%, p<0.001) (Preliminary analysis - results not yet published) (34, 35) . Finally, several geriatric care models were designed to address the needs of older people in the emergency department (ED) , such as the use of discrete geriatric boxes , cubicles or rooms (36). These are places especially equipped for older patients and have a multidisciplinary team of specialists - including a geriatrician - available that can immediately assess patients and speed up the decision- making process regarding hospital admission or discharge. A recent meta- analysis suggested that discrete geriatric boxes at the ED have infrastructural benefits and seem to nourish consistent geriatric -oriented practice and the development of geriatric expertise and s ome care models resulted in a shor ter hospital length of stay and fewer readmission (36)., Offering multidisciplinary CGA at ED observation units has also been found feasible and resulting in targeted interventions (37) . Implementation of CGA based models in clinical practice The implementation of CGA based models has recently been studied in 8 European countries as part of the imAGE.eu study (38). Overall, CGA -based models of care are most widely implemented in Belgium, Denmark and Ireland, while the uptake has been lower in the other surveyed countries (i.e. Estonia, Greece, Iceland, Malta, Slovenia) . Despite the current evidence supporting the implementation of several CGA -based models of care, there is still a long way to go in terms of further scaling up and working toward system sustainability in most European countries . Having a political framework and sufficient capacity in terms of geriatricians or geriatric specialists were found to be two important facilitators to speed up the large-scale implementation of care models for frail older people. 5 Switzerland did not participate in the imAGE.eu study and finding reliable numbers regarding the degree of implementation of each of the CGA -based models of care is challenging. In 2010 the Federal Statistical Office reported the total number of hospital beds and hospitalizations for rehabilitation and geriatrics as a total, but not separately . So although an increase is observed of both the number of geriatric/rehab beds (6'808 or 17.5% in 2 010 versus 7'143 or 18.7% in 2014) and geriatric/rehab hospitalizations (85'123 or 0.06% in 2010 versus 96'734 or 0.07% in 2014), we cannot evaluate whether this is due to an increase in geriatric or in rehabilitation beds. Nevertheless, the total increase is limited and does not keep up with the health care needs of the aging populations. For the other models of care, no numbers could be found. With regard to the capacity in terms of geriatricians, it is important to mention that i n 2000 the Swiss Medical Association certified the geriatric discipline consisting of 2 years of additional postgraduate training in geriatrics and 1 year in geriatric psychiatry . This has resulted in an increasing number of certified geriatricians from 149 in 2008 up to 246 in 2017 (39). This corresponds to an increase from one geriatrician per 8'567 people to one per 6504 people aged 65 years, respectively . Although there are no cl ear guidelines regarding the ideal 'geriatrician : older people' ratio, earlier studies already described 1 : 4'736 as burdensome (40), so the current number can be considered insufficient . As attracting sufficient young physicians towards geriatrics is believed not to meet the demands, it has been advocated t hat all physicians should be equipped to give quality of care to older adults, while geriatricians should focus on treating the most complex and frail patients (41) . Call for action To hospital administrators and management Acute geriatric care units are still considered the golden standard for delivering high quality of care to frail older people. Investments in these units result in better quality of care for the patient and improve system outcomes. When resources and/or ge riatric expertise is limited, invest in the implementation of geriatric co -management teams or wards, guaranteeing proactive and direct care in an at-risk population. Although systematic frailty screening should not be implemented as a stand- alone intervention, it supports decision- making regarding the place of admission in the hospital, indicates the need for follow -up assessment, tailored interventions and follow - up, and increases awareness regarding geriatric care aspects. To educators Baseline knowledge and skills regarding geriatric syndromes and care should be included in curricula of all physicians, social and health care professionals, as all w ill be faced with the frail older people regardless of the setting or ward they are workin g. Nurses play a crucial role in the CGA approach, but too often the focus in curricula is too strongly focused on the assessment. The complexity of CGA lays however in the development and coordination of an integrated care plan. Skills in the field of communication, leadership, change management, coaching and supporting self - management are therefore often overlooked and should be more central in the nursing curric ula. To policy and decision- makers 6 Legislation or national frameworks have shown to be effec tive tools to speed up the implementati on of CGA based models of care in other European countries. As the most successful approach is to combine a top- down and bottom -up approach, involvement of stakeholders in the development of any legislation and framew ork is crucial. Comprehensive assessment, interdisciplinary teamwork, and care coordination are not only relevant within one setting, but also across care settings. Indeed, due to illness or increased dependency, older people often receive health and social services by a large number of care providers in different care settings over time. Unfortunately, care across settings is often not well coordinated. Too often, health and social care workers apply a 'silo mentality' and operate without knowledge of the personal preferences expressed, problems addressed, services provided, or treatments prescribed in other settings. As a result, older people are at risk of receiving fragmented care and poorly executed care transitions to and from the hospital , resulting i n duplication of services, gaps in information delivery, inappropriate or conflicting care recommendations, medication errors, increased confusion and distress, and higher costs (42, 43) . Political structures and financial incentives that support integrated care need to be provided. To researchers CGA -based models of care are per definition multilevel complex interventions (44-46). Taking into account the current evidence- base of these models, researchers should at this point decide clearly for hybrid effectiveness -implementation designs to study the impact as well as the implementation efforts. To go for full and sustainable implem entation, context analysis, stakeholder involvement, and focus on implementation outcomes (e.g. reach, fidelity, acceptability, implementation cost) should be part of any study evaluating the implementation of complex models of care (47).

Swiss National Report on Quality and Safety in Healthcare Invitations for short reports and confirmed contributions From a surgical point of view Professor Michele Genoni Department of Cardiovascular Surgery UniversityHospital Zurich CH-8090 Zurich SGHC/SSCC committee member and quality officer FMCH committee member and head of quality SAQM steering committee member Swiss Patient Safety Foundation trustee SMB executive committee member Date of Submission: 16.01.2019 Genoni, Swiss National Report on Quality 2 Qualit\u00e4t in der Medizin Patienten als Ganzes. Genoni, Swiss National Report on Quality 3 Abstract Quality in surgery is close to the heart of all surgical societies in Switzerland. According to the federal health system in Switzerland, the activities are located in the individual medical professional societies and are not coordinated. The Umbrella Association of Surgical and Invasive Societies and Specialist Groups (FMCH) supports and coordinates quality assurance. In addition, there are many organisations (Foundation for Patient Safety, Swiss Medical Board, Sw iss Academy for Quality in Medicine, Working Group for Quality Assurance in Surgery AQC, etc.) which develop projects and guidelines for interdisciplinary quality. These projects complement the activities of the individual professional societies and form a foundation on which the professional societies themselves can also create new projects. The Swiss healthcare system, which has a federal structure, poses major challenges in terms of quality assurance in medicine. Many stakeholders are involved and there is a danger that responsibilities could constantly change. It is therefore all the more important that those directly responsible (the professional groups addressed) bear responsibility for quality and that the healthcare providers define the guiding frame work . This division of work and responsibility leads to success. The financing of quality measures and the safeguarding of data quality and data protection are still unresolved. These open points are currently being discussed in the Federal Parliament. In the future, medicine will have to move away from performance- based billing and assessment by means of a paradigm shift towards value- based medicine. The focus will shift to process quality with a special emphasis on indication quality and the needs of the patient as a whole. Genoni, Swiss National Report on Quality 4 Introduction Various specialist disciplines have emerged in surgery in parallel with the development and refinement of surgical treatment options. Members of the various disciplines are organised in independent medical professional societies at both the national and international level. What members of the specialist surgical societies have in common is their physical place of work, the operating theatre, and the invasive nature of their procedures. The patient is increasingly the focus of attention in modern medicine. As a result , new fields of medicine are emerging on the basis of commonalities in the treatment of organ disease, for example cardiac medicine (cardiology and cardiac surgery) and hepatobiliary medicine (gastroenterology, oncology, visceral surgery, etc.). Quality is a deep concern for all the specialist surgical societies in Switzerland. We all want patients to attain the best possible state of health following treatment. This means that: Society has to realistically plan optimum public healthcare with the resources available Patients must be given the best possible opportunities to heal Doctors must conduct the right treatment flawlessly. So what does a patient 's final health or medical state depend on? A whole host of different factors feed into this: The patient 's initial state of health The quality of the way the case history is recorded (anamnesis) The quality of the way the condition is identified (diagnosis) The quality of the way the treatment is determined (indication) The quality of the treatment The quality of patient involvement and collaboration This points the way to the potential approaches for measures to promote and assure quality to attain the best possible state of health for our patients: 1. Basic and ongoing training of medical staff 2. Mentoring and coaching for junior staff 3. Interdisciplinary and interprofessional culture 4. Performance measurement (processes and functions) 5. Continuous, systematic improvement Genoni, Swiss National Report on Quality 5 Organisation of surgical societies in Switzerland Swiss Medical Association (FMH) The FMH (Foederatio Medicorum Helveticorum) is a professional body representing more than 40,000 members. At the same time, the FMH serves as the umbrella association for more than 70 medical organisations, with various bodies performing the functions necessary for successful association policy. Powers and responsibilities are set down in a legal framework including the articles of association. The general secretariat, empl oying more than 90 people, serves as the interface between doctors and the general public, and is in charge of coordinating the operational and strategic/policy levels. The medical professional societies are professional and scientific associations as def ined in Article 60ff of the Swiss Civil Code. They monitor the quality of medical work, safeguard the professional and economic interests of their members, and promote scientific activity in their specialist field. The societies also play an important role in developing young talent by providing continuing training and education. They are guided by the professional rules of the FMH. The FMCH is an umbrella association bringing together 21 surgical and invasive societies and specialist groups and three medical professional organisations representing around 10,000 doctors. The FMCH supports its members and represents their health and professional policy interests as well as coordinating medical care, continuing education, quality assurance, tariffs and f ees. Genoni, Swiss National Report on Quality 6 Quality in surgery Doctors, hospitals and other healthcare providers are legally obliged to ascertain and account for the quality of their services. Various institutions and associations occupy themselves with quality in surgery, with the active involvement of surgeons. These days the Swiss Academy of Medical Sciences (SAMS) acts as a bridge- builder between science and society. Its areas of focus include clarifying ethical questions in connection with developments in medicine. The SAMS inf luences quality in medicine at a strategic level through its work to formulate recommendations (registers, certification and quality data) and its involvement in the Swiss M edical Board. The Swiss Patient Safety Foundation is a recognised think tank dedicated to excellence. It serves as a national centre of competence advocating a consistent, constructive culture of safety in Swiss healthcare. It works in constructive partnership with a wide range of actors in healthcare to develop joint solutions to promote patient safety, process quality and the necessary framework, and facilitate their propagation. The foundation launches and manages national programmes, research projects and training offerings designed to reduce safety r isks. The Swiss Medical Board (SMB) is a leading Swiss centre of competence for health technology assessment, analysing and evaluating preventive and diagnostic procedures and therapeutic interventions from a medical, economic, ethical and legal point of view. On this basis the SMB formulates recommendations for political decision- makers , medical specialists and other care providers. In select cases it also publishes information sheets for patients. The Swiss Medical Board (SMB) is sponsored by an association with the following institutions and bodies as members: the S wiss Conference of Cantonal Ministers of Education (EDK), the Swiss Academy of Medical Sciences (SAMS), the government of the Principality of Liechtenstein, Interpharma (the association of pharmaceutical companies in Switzerland doing research) , health insurers ' associations (sant\u00e9suisse and curafutura), the SPO Swiss patient organisation, the DVSP (umbrella association of Swiss patients ' organisations) and the FMCH (Umbrella Association of Surgical and Invasive Societies and Specialist Groups). Cantonal departments of health (taking Canton Zurich as an example). A core task of the department of health is to work with the hospitals and other partners to assure high- quality medical treatment for people in the canton of Zurich. The department has an excellent basis for doing so in the form of its 2012 hospital lists and the canton' s hospital planning and funding act . Its work on quality takes place, for example, by way of quality controls in selected specialist areas at listed Zurich hospitals and quality development w ith the relevant hospital representatives. The Swiss Academy for Quality in Medicine (SAQM) is the physicians ' own quality organisation, promoting all aspects of medical quality -related work to the benefit of patients, their families and doctors, and play ing a pioneering role in quality in medicine. Its efforts to develop medical quality take the form, for example, of its own projects, competitions, and support and guidance for external projects. The Swiss National Association for Quality Development in Hospitals (ANQ) is an association under the terms of Art. 60ff of the Swiss Civil Code with its office in Bern. Its goal is to coordinate and execute quality development measures at a national level, in particular the uniform implementation of outcome qual ity measurements in hospitals and clinics with the aim of documenting, developing and improving quality. The goal is to facilitate nationwide comparisons and define the framework necessary to do so. It also assures coordination with Genoni, Swiss National Report on Quality 7 the requirements of the Federal Health Insurance Act. The association is a non- profit organisation (NPO). The working committee on quality assurance in surgery (AQC) is a group of heads of surgery and inpatient doctors aiming to create and compare joint statistics on cases and intervention as a way of assuring quality and recognising their own strengths. To this end, the AQC draws up comprehensive quality documentation for all medical cases with prospective data on cases, operations and interventions, paediatrics and outcomes. Genoni, Swiss National Report on Quality 8 Current projects related to safety, quality and efficiency in surgery It is well known that the Swiss healthcare system is organised along federalist lines. As a result , and extraordinary number of different stakeholders have an influence on the quality of the individual components of care and thus on the healthcare system as a whole. Surg ery in general has always been concerned with quality, thanks to the fact that treatments can be evaluated directly. Increasing options for gathering, storing and comparing data electronically have also set the stage for cross -comparisons of the work of surgeons. Surgeons have embraced this challenge and are actively participating in endeavours to develop and plan quality in medicine. The Umbrella Association of Surgical and Invasive Societies and Specialist Groups (FMCH) is involved with quality -related issues within various institutions: The FMCH is represented on the steering committee of the SAQM and has actively worked on the following projects: Quality charter Every physician is dedicated to impeccable quality of medical treatment and serving the needs and wellbeing of patients and society as a whole. For this reason the SAQM and various medical organisations have drawn up a binding quality charter. It is a declarati on of the will to network and cooperate on quality matters in Switzerland. The charter is built on three pillars: 1. Transparency - making visible existing and new medical activities designed to promote the quality of medicine and medical care provision 2. Comm itment - the signatory medical organisations develop a quality strategy and evaluate work regularly in a quarterly report 3. Sustainability - the quality strategy is geared to the long term and assures quality development. Quality -related work is an integral component of basic and continuing medical training and education, and is based on the foundation of the law and data protection legislation. \"Guidelines Schweiz \" online platform Medical guidelines are intended to facilitate the process of making evidence- based decisions in the interests of providing the best possible treatment to patients. Countless guidelines already exist, and new ones are being created all the time. T his makes it hard to keep track of all the guidelines and leads to uncertainty when it comes to applying them. The \"Guidelines Switzerland\" online platform gives an overview of the guidelines and information about them which are endorsed by the professional Swiss associations. Since 2017 professional associations, hospitals, clinics and other healthcare organisations have been able to document guidelines recognised by them on the online platform. The platform is updated on a regular basis and serves as a foundation for ongoing work by the SAQM on the topic of guidelines. Genoni, Swiss National Report on Quality 9 Since 2018 the FMCH has been a sponsoring member of the Swiss Medical Board (SMB) and represented on its executive committee. This way the surgical and invasive societies can exert a direct influence on processes for systematically evaluating medical procedures and technologies in terms of public healthcare. The aim is to come up with evidence- based medical decisions. By way of example, here are the five most recent surgically -relevant topics that have already been completed: Bariatric surgery versus non- surgical treatment for obesity Acute and subacute radiculopathies due to intervertebral disc herniation: conservative versus surgical treatment Systemic screening mammography Surgical therapy of liver metastases from colorectal cancer Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty for osteoporosis -related fractures of the vertebral body. The FMCH sits on the foundation board of the Patient Safety Foundation alongside representatives of the Federal Office of Public Health, the Swiss Academy of Medical Sciences and numerous other professional associations in healthcare. In this capacity it has actively wo rked on or supported various projects: Safe surgery: At the heart of this project is the WHO 's 2009 safe surgery checklist, which was specifically adapted to Switzerland with the intention of working through it. The \"Safe Surgery \" pilot programme was primarily funded by the FOPH as an integral component of the national quality strategy, and was co- funded by the FMCH. Besides a nationwide campaign, a more in- depth project was conducted with ten pilot hospitals, and the checklist was implemented and appl ied in practice. The core elements were four cross -institutional workshops and in- house activities such as adapting the checklist and training staff. The programme was accompanied by a comprehensive evaluation concentrating on the way the implementation of the necessary activities was supported, guided and evaluated. The programme also involved publishing a series of papers, developing an e -learning course and putting together an implementation toolkit. Now it is applied by Swiss surgeons almost across the board! Morbidity and mortality conferences (MoMo) : Together with the FOPH, the FMH and the H+ Die Spit\u00e4ler der Schweiz umbrella association, the FMCH is actively supporting the Patient Safety Foundation' s MoMo project. The intention is to adapt and refine this patient safety instrument for Switzerland, ultimately to be applied across the board at all surgical clinics. In collaboration with the Dialog Ethik ethics institute, the FMCH has created and implemented the Swiss Oath pledge for medical doctors. The oath is designed to protect and strengthen the medical ethos, safeguard the dignity of the medical profession and its responsibility towards patients, and thus express the humane orientation of the profession. An important aspect of the pledge is thus safeguarding and improving patient indication and treatment. Genoni, Swiss National Report on Quality 10 The surgical societies initiate projects in their specialist field, either individually or as part of joint working parties. The annex contains a list of the quality -related projects run by the societies affiliated to the FMCH. In this context a number of projects should be highlighted: The AQC working committee on quality assurance in surgery (AQC) involves most of the surgical teaching hospitals and private clinics. The AQC provides more than ten medical professional societies with modular technologies for the simultaneous, integrated and largely automated completion of multiple questionnaires, and takes charge of capturing and analysing the data. This analysis enables cross -comparisons, covering the quality of both indication and outcome. Swissorthopaedics (the Swiss Society of Orthopaedics and Traumatology) operates the SIRIS register as a tool for measuring quality in medical implants. All types of implantation can be registered in SIRIS. Around 20,000 artificial hip joints and 16,000 artificial knee joints are currently implanted in Switzerland every year. Impressive are the annual growth rates: 1% for hips and 4 -5% for knees. SIRIS serves as an early warning system for implant failure, an indicator of complications in surgical interventions, a benchmark for comparisons at industry and hospital level, and a database for long -term outcomes and survi val analyses. The Swiss Society for Cardiac and Vascular Thoracic Surgery (SGHC) runs the national cardiac surgery register, in which all cardiac surgery centres in Switzerland participate. The register follows the European QUIP database. In the process of developing the register the interfaces to data protection in Switzerland were clarified, and comprehensive audits were conducted to assure data quality. The register is one of the requirements for inclusion on the Canton Zurich hospital list. The medical professional societies, within the framework of their quality strategies, also define the interdisciplinary and interprofessional requirements for indication quality, for example, the interdisciplinary indication conferences (tumour boards, angioboards , heart team conferences, etc.) developed by doctors and adopted by the societies in their guidelines. The Swiss Society of Cardiology and the Swiss Society for Cardiac and Vascular Thoracic Surgery have set down and published details of collaboration in interdisciplinary decision- making for the best treatment of patients (quality of indication) in Switzerland (Thorac Cardiovasc Surg. 2017 Oct;65(7):519 -523). Genoni, Swiss National Report on Quality 11 Difficulties and hurdles in the implementation of quality - related projects The Swiss healthcar e system, set up along federalist lines, is acknowledged to be one of the best in the world, enabling people to lead long, active lives. In line with the times, however, the quality of healthcare must be transparent, sustainable and fundable. To assure thi s, the efforts of the various stakeholders in the Swiss healthcare system have to be structured and coordinated. The way the system is set up is complex but amenable to progress, and innovation is encouraged and promoted. The federal government is respons ible for nationwide healthcare strategy, stipulating what services must be provided and laying down the condition that care must be effective, expedient and economical. The federal government can plan systematic scientific controls to safeguard quality and delegate the performance of these controls to the professional associations. The federal government sets down the measures used to assure the quality or appropriate deployment of services. The cantons are responsible for actual implementation by drawing up hospital lists, awarding contracts for services and monitoring compliance with the provisions of healthcare legislation. Ultimately, it is a matter of striking a balance between a patient -friendly healthcare system and the entrepreneurial freedom of prov iders with clear principles of conduct (a clear framework, the same rules for everyone, transparent procedures, involving care providers, etc.). At the same time , there are other stakeholders with a say in the healthcare system: insurers, hospital associations, patient organisations, doctors, etc. There is a risk that competencies will be fragmented on the different levels and that those involved will focus on thei r own interests, even though everyone has a commitment to quality. Medical authority and powers and responsibilities for developing rational structures for medical facilities, systems and treatments must lie in the hands of the relevant group of professionals : the doctors. The guiding framework within which these structures, processes and activities should run must be defined by the sponsors of the healthcare system. A good example is the successful demarcation of responsibilities in Canton Zurich between t he canton' s department of health and the hospitals listed for cardiac surgery. Every year the hospitals report on their quality indicators and activities (in 2018 this was done around the table) and discuss appropriate measures for improvement. As a matter of interest , these quality metrics were proposed by the medical specialists to the department of health, which also approved them. In other words , the specialists have defined the quality indicators, while the authorities monitor their development. There is still plenty of preliminary work to be done in the healthcare system if Switzerland is to establish a cross -disciplinary healthcare quality strategy across the board. The question of who covers the costs of capturing and analysing data on treatmen t quality has to be settled. At the same time , unrestricted independence has to be guaranteed. In my opinion, funding proof of quality has to be part of the system of compensation. Only this way can the measurement of quality be demanded by the provider. T he quality strategy should be drawn up by the medical professional society in question and then submitted to the sponsors. Data quality . Capturing quality -related key performance indicators (KPIs) is a major challenge and will remain so in future. How can one be sure that the data gathered corresponds to reality? Given the growing significance of value- based measurements, it is important to realise that data are often gathered on the basis of Genoni, Swiss National Report on Quality 12 an individual judgement on the part of those doing the gathering. At this point , audits designed to assure the quality and transparency of the data gathered reach their limits. Data protection. The data protection rules in Switzerland are currently in development. The country 's federalist set -up certainly does not make this any easier. To paraphrase the troubadour of Bern, Mani Matter, democracy can never be more than a process of agreeing to disagree. I believe that arrangements should be in place to ensure that data are gathe red on a pseudonymised basis. Once data have been audited, and before they are analysed, they should be completely anonymised to assure that our patients ' personality rights are protected. The publication of data must be regulated in advance. Quality measu rements should be done primarily to improve quality; their use for the regulation of the healthcare system should be only secondary. Care should always be taken not to upset patients or make them insecure by publishing data. It follows that publications of quality - related data should be produced jointly by all those involved. At the federal political level, on 11 June 2018 the Swiss National Council passed draft health insurance legislation on improving quality and cost -efficiency (15.083) with a large maj ority. The debate in the Council of States is still pending. The surgical profession supports this project as a whole. The draft legislation proposes a bottom -up approach, designed to boost the quality assurance role of the actors involved. The most impor tant institutional pillars of quality assurance in Switzerland are the Patient Safety Foundation and the ANQ. The Patient Safety Foundation covers matters of process quality, while the ANQ works on outcome quality. The two organisations complement each other and fit well into the quality architecture set down in the Federal Health Insurance Act. Approval of this legislation should assure sustained funding for these organisations. Under the draft , the tariff partners will also have to conclude contracts on quality development (so -called quality agreements). This provision should be welcomed, especially given that since it entered into force in 1996 , the Health Insurance Act has required that tariffs and quality assurance be linked. The FMCH and sant\u00e9suisse have already taken a step in this direction by concluding a tariff agreement for flat charges for outpatient services. Providers wanting to bill on a flat, per -case basis must undertake to take part in a recognised quality assurance scheme. This means that the tariff agreement on flat charges for outpatient care could be described as a quality agreement avant la lettre. In any case , modern tariff systems which do not involve an evaluation of quality and benefit are no longer conceivable. The draft is therefore a sensible step into the future. The proposed legislation mentions quality of indications by name. Requirements governing the quality of indication place the debate on \"unnecessary operations \", which unfortunately often takes a populist and sensationalist form, on a firm scientific and objective basis. From the point of view of the medical profession these endeavours are worthy of support, as they will improve the quality of indications. Quali ty in surgery going forward What were the attributes of good surgeons at the beginnings of medical history? Above all they had to be fast so that patients would not have to suffer for long. With the advent of anaesthetics, surgery changed radically. Surg eons could start refining their actual craft. Quality was measured by different criteria, also taking account of a certain sustainability. Surgeons made their skills and craftsmanship available to patients. Genoni, Swiss National Report on Quality 13 In the era of DRGs ( diagnosis related groups) qua lity is measured on the basis of the intervention itself: mortality and infection rates, reoperations, etc. The patient takes second place to the action. Performance -based billing does not focus on the actual benefit to the patient. Now we are seeing a gra dual change. Fewer and fewer interventions take the form of open surgery, and these days we often have a range of treatment options to choose from. Specialisation is leading to a situation where each physician is increasingly focused on narrower areas. Thi s development in medicine gives additional weight to the choice of intervention. The quality of indication increases under the Donabedian model. What approach is best for this individual patient? What treatment can be expected to deliver the greatest benef it or utility for the patient? How will a therapy impact their quality of life in the longer term? This \" value- based medicine\" approach means that the result of therapy has to be rated somewhere between the two extremes of \"perfect health\" and \"death\" . The value or quality of a medical treatment should be measured and financially \" rewarded\" by the attainment of a desired result for the patient rather than by the procedure used to treat the patient. As medicine undergoes inexorable transformation, surgery m ust reorient itself within the framework of value- based medicine . Outcome measurement remains as a way of evaluating a small sub- section of medical quality using tried -and-tested means. But the actual focus has to be on process quality. In addition to being of major importance for patients, quality of indications also makes economic sense. This paradigm shift can only take place if we devote our attentions to training our young colleagues. What kind of surgeons will be needed in the future? What skills will they have to master? With the quality of indications being given greater weight, surgeons will have to be more like doctors again. In addition to having the necessary manual skills and craftsmanship, they must focus on the needs of the person in their entirety. For this to happen, we have to discuss what skills will be required in the future. Genoni, Swiss National Report on Quality 14 Recommendations In surgery, many quality programs are applied by various stakeholders. There is a lack of coordination of these activities and a miss of a common goal. Surgeons and invasive physicians are convinced that the quality activities in medicine must be managed by the service providers. The task of the Confederation, the cantons, insurers, hospitals and politicians in general is to define the tasks, to set the guiding framework and guarantee funding. Surgeons and invasive physicians recommend an uniform strategy for their specialist area, which assesses the activity in the most objectifiable form possible. The miles tone of a quality strategy comprises the indication quality with the interdisciplinary boards the outcome quality with which the subject -specific risk adjustment is mandatory and finally the introduction of Patient Reported Outcome Measures tools. Indica tors for quality measurement must be defined by the specialized physicians or their professional associations, taking into account the international guidelines, which must also be adapted to Swiss conditions (e.g. minimum case numbers). Genoni, Swiss National Report on Quality 15 Appendix 1. PROMS (Patient -reported outcome measures) The showcase project is the SIRIS Register of Swiss orthopedics. In this register, the patients are checked area- wide after the implantation of an orthopedic prosthesis. The register will be described and first res ults published in the Annual Report 2015. www.swissorthopaedics.ch/images/content/SISRIS/170516_SIRISAnnualReport2015_Finalc opie.pdf 2. SSI (Surgical Site Infection) In Switzerland, the defined SSI Swissnoso is recorded. Siwssnoso is the association of leading experts in the field of infectious diseases and hospital hygiene. The Swiss Society of Cardiac Surgery requires its members to join Swissnoso, which, for example, measures sternum infections (integrated in the national regist er of cardiac surgery). Siwssnoso publishes the infections in an annual bulletin: https://www.swissnoso.ch/fileadmin/module/ssi_surveillance/Dokumente_D/9_Results/20170 904_SSI_Nationaler_Vergleichsbericht_2015_2016_Swissnoso.pdf 3. Outcome Data As describ ed in the report, the surgical societies have different outcome data. From my experience, I can tell you about the national registry for cardiac surgery. As you can see from the attached annual report of the register, the data quality is a big problem. We have discussed our register with the Federal Data Protection Commissioner and sent it to the Swiss Academy of Medical Sciences for review. All input has been included in the enclosed handbook. Although the data quality is not satisfactory, the list hospitals in Zurich are discussing the results together with the cantonal health directorate. This open exchange leads to an enormous awareness of quality. Many registers that we operate in Switzerland do not control data quality. From my experience with the nati onal register for cardiac surgery, the evaluation of all these registers is questionable. 4. Federal Statistical Office The Federal Statistical Office also publishes outcome data. In our opinion, however, these data are only risk -adjusted in terms of age and gender and cannot be used in everyday life. In addition, the classification is based on the coding, which does not re flect the medical point of view. 5. Surgical Checklist The \"Safe Surgery\" checklist is used throughout Switzerland. However, the effects with regard to quality indicators are not recorded. Rather, the Foundation for Patient Safety is in the process of carrying out a so -called refresher to ensure that the checklist is applied correctly. 6. M&M Conference The Foundation for Patient Safety has investigated and published the application of the M&M Conference in Switzerland (Schwappbach D. et al. Morbidity and mortality conferences in Lower Saxony: Implementation status and further development needs, Z Evid Fortbild Qual Gesundhwes. 2018 Sep;135 -136:34- 40), attached to this writing. The survey underlined the need for a national guideline. This initiative has led various hospitals to implement the introduction of a structured M&M Conference, e.g. University Hospital Zurich. Quality and Safety of Anaesthesiology in Switzerland A contribution to the Swiss National Report on Quality and Safety in Healthcare By Sven Staender Regional Hospital Maennedorf CH-8708 of submission: January 2019; revised version February 3rd 2019 word count: 3252 2 1. Abstract Anaesthesiology today in Switzerland is still very safe and delivered with highest quality. But this safety is beginning to be eroded. Pressure on staffing, medication issues, dealing with post -operative complications, confidentiality of reporting systems etc. are only a few emerging problems. We still have the possibility to tackle this challenge. But action must be taken now. 2. General remarks Anaesthesia in the elective, more or less healthy patient is considered to be very safe. The mortality risk from complications and adverse events of anaesthesia appears to be at approximately 1:100'000 cases today1. Anaesthesiologists have a long history of engaging with safety: as early as 1978, a group at Harvard University systematically analysed errors in anaesthesiology and highlighted the special importance of the 'human factor '2. Consequently, under the acronym ' Crew Resource Management ', teams were trained in simulators starting back in 1987. In the United States, from 1984 onwards, closed claims in anaesthesiology were analysed systematically, to draw lessons from them3. In 1993, the technique of 'Incident Reporting' was used as an instrument f or recording critical incidents in anaesthesiology at the national level in Australia and to exploit their learning potential4. This systematic collecti on and provision of critical incidents was disseminated in 1995 by anaesthesiologists in Switzerland under the acronym CIRS (Critical Incident Reporting System) using Internet technology5, 6. Thus, anaesthesiology is justified in claiming to be in the vanguard of safety management in medicine. But despite these success factors, systematic and large- scale outcome data for morbidity in anaesthesiolog y is lacking (at least in Switzerland). 3. Methods For that reason, this report can't base on strong facts on quality and safety in anaesthesiology in Switzerland (with the exception of published data from the committee for the analysis of closed liability claims in anaesthesiology). To address this problem the author has put together a set of questions around the published spectrum of safety - relevant aspects in the literature, using the taxonomy of a tool called ' Safety Management in Hospitals ' (SMAHO)7. These questions then were used for a structured interview with representatives from hospitals of various care levels in Switzerland. Interviews were performed with senior anaesthesiologists from University hospitals, cantonal hospitals, regional hospitals, and private hospitals as well as anaesthesiol ogists working in office -based service in the German as well as French speaking parts of Switzerland. In total, 12 interviews have been performed between November and December 2018. 4. Main findings and valuation 4.1. Established tools on Quality & Safety in Anaesthesiology in Switzerland Various tools and projects on quality and safety in anaesthesiology do exist in Switzerland. The following list gives an overview. For more details please consult the corresponding information available on the internet: a) Anaesthesia Patient Safety Foundation8 3 b) Various committees at the Swiss Society for Anaesthesiology and Resuscitation (SGAR/SSAR)9 Committee for data and quality with a Minimal Data Set in Anaesthesiology (MDS) now followed by the project called A -QUA CH10 Committee for structure and processes supporting the global ' Helsin ki Declaration on Safety in Anaesthesiology ' Committee for the analysis of closed liabi lity claims in anaesthesiology c) Various local simulation centres with regional training opportunities 4.2. Main topics under concern 4.2.1. Measures and warning systems 4.2.1.1. Closed Claims Analysis Since 1987 more than 200 closed claims with liability aspects related to anaesthesiology have been filed in Switzerland. A committee of the SGAR/SSAR collects and analyses these data. The majority of clai ms (54%) were related to regional anaesthesia, with general anaesthesia accounting for 28% and other anaesthesia- related procedures for 18%. The quality of care was judged by the committee to be substandard in 55% of cases, and liability was accepted in 46% of all claims. The incidence as well as mortality of claims in Switzerland is of a similar magnitude to those in the UK and a bit lesser than in the USA11. Closed claims analysis has prov en beneficial in monitoring and learning from this aspect of medical care and is thus recommended for other disciplines. In addition, this group has published quality -standards for legal reports like mandatory 4- eyes -principle for every report etc. 4.2.1.2. Lack of outcome- data Although the SGAR/SSAR has quite a tradition with registries of outcome data (MDS and A -QUA CH), most of the anaesthesiology departments contacted do not collect outcome data in anaesthesiology. One of the problems behind is the lack of proper definitions of anaesthesiology -outcomes. The rather old (and unfortunately no longer existing) project called ' OUTCOME ' in canton Z\u00fcrich12 was considered to be a very valuable system especially due to frequent benchmarking workshops with the possibility to interact with other anaesthesiologists peer -to-peer. Proper definitions, large registries as wel l as regular benchmarking should be considered. 4.2.1.3. Threat on reporting systems The recent decision by the federal court on the edition duty of incident -reporting data - collections led to a severe uncertainty among hospital staff to continue reporting safety -relevant events. This uncertainty may completely destroy the confidence in these systems and by that destroy the reporting -culture at all. A legal protection of such incident reporting systems is an old request13 (almost 20 years old) that must now be taken forward by the regulating bodies with utmost priority. A corresponding request is actually pending in the National Council14. 4 4.2.2. Threats to Safety in Anaesthesiology 4.2.2.1. Problems with staffing The 'Helsinki declaration on Patient Safety in Anaesthesiology '15 is a global adopted declaration. Among other requirements, this declaration states: \" The funders of healthcare have a right to expect that perioperative anaesthesia care will be delivered safely and therefore they must provide appropriate resources. \" Economic considerations lead to more and more pressure on staffing levels in anaesthesiology in all professions like specialised anaesthesia nursing -care as well as physician anaesthesiologists. It has been reported that especially small hospitals are forced to cut back the staffing -levels of specialised anaesthesia nurses on duty, by that colliding with published minimal staffing lev els of the SGAR/SSAR as well as the basic requirements of the ' Helsinki Declaration on Patient Safety in Anaesthesiology '. In parallel goes an increasing shortage of specialised anaesthesia nurses as well as a beginning shortage of physician anaesthesiol ogists in Switzerland. The SGAR/SSAR is currently running a demographic study and the results shall be available mid 2019. The shortage of specialists on the one hand and the cutback of staffing levels lead to a decrease in the availability of well -trained specialists. This poses a big threat on safety in anaesthesiology in Switzerland. Another aspect are the rigid rules of the labour law (Arbeitsgesetz, ArG). These rules are often troublesome when applied to hospitals (especially small teams) and they lead to an increase in handovers of care -teams, which again are correlated with increased numbers of complications16. Here, a version of the ArG that is adapted to the special needs of hospitals must be considered. 4.2.2.2. Patient selection and indication, role of the Anaesthesiologist The safety of anaesthesiology already starts in patient selection and proper optimization of sick patients. This selection requires a true partnership between surgeon and anaesthesiologist in order to properly select these cases that do NOT qualify for surgery or for an office -based procedure. Whenever this relationship is not a partnership of peers the opinion of the anaesthesiologist on the individual patient risk inv olved may not be heard. This poses avoidable risk to the patients. So, a true partnership of peers is required and the standing and reputation of the anaesthesiologist must be kept high in order to support that partnership between surgeons and anaesthesiol ogists. Decision making on the risk and risk mitigation should be mandatory and to be done interdisciplinary. An aspect closely related is the topic of widening the indication for a procedure. This may happen due to problematic incentives that are establi shed in Swiss health care (including personal case- load levels for certain procedures). As reported in the interviews, anaesthesiologists sometimes back -up these widened indications for various reasons. These kinds of incentives and goals should be re- evaluated. 4.2.2.3. Medication safety The last decade was characterized by an increasing rate of drug shortages in medicine for various reasons. This shortage may in the best case be just troublesome 5 but in the worst case it is a threat to patient safety (e.g. antibiotic shortages etc.). Specifically, in anaesthesiology the shortage of Remifentanil posed a threat to anaesthesiology departments that have a high rate of so -called \"Target -controlled gener al anaesthesia\" cases. In these departments, the standard procedures had to be adjusted to this shortage. Although to the author's knowledge no patient harm has been reported, such a change in standard procedures may be considered a safety hazard. Larger s tock of essential medication or a better network among hospitals should be considered. Another topic with safety hazard potential is related to the so -called off-label use of drugs. Such an off -label use is not considered to be a ' no-go' but is related t o strict rules on informed consent17. According to the results of the interviews wi th peers of anaesthesiology in Switzerland, this detailed informed consent in off -label use of drugs is not a reality in the majority of cases. Here, a practical solution must be found not only for anaesthesiology but also for intensive care medicine or ot her disciplines. 4.2.2.4. Challenges in hygiene Today, a growing number of equipment is meant to be one- way equipment mainly due to hygiene aspects. This requires quite a large stock of supply with its related cost. In office -based anaesthesia various si ngle-used equipment like e.g. face masks for mask ventilation are sometimes used repeatedly, mainly due to limited stock capacity. The impact on infection rates due to this practice may be low but not zero. 4.2.2.5. Recovery after anaesthesia Recovery after general anaesthesia is a crucial aspect of safety. Various standards and recommendations (like staffing and equipment as well as physiologic cut -off levels for transfer etc.) are published. After hours availability of recovery room facilities is an o n-going challenge for hospitals with impact on safety. This is amplified in the office- based setting due to insufficient compensations for recovery care in the TarMed tariff. 4.2.2.6. ' Failure -to-rescue' Still, patients die after surgery, but not mainly in the operating room (mortality rate less than 0.001%) rather post -operatively and mainly on the normal ward (mortality rate as high as 4%)18. There is growing evidence that a large proportion of this post - operative death rate derives from compli cations. This phenomenon has more recently been called ' failure to rescue (FTR)', which has been defined as death after complications19. Proper complication management therefore can help saving lives in a large proportion. This aspect is not only related to post -OP recovery facilities but also to the rapid availability of specialized personnel and appropriate monitoring technology to treat these patients. The concept of ' Medical Emergency Teams ' (METs) has proven beneficial in various publications but is not followed in Switzerland in a large scale. In addition, anaesthesiologists should play a role also on the ward, outside the ope rating room (OR): they are already involved in post -operative pain management and they know their patients from the time in the OR. Consequently, anaesthesiologists would very much qualify as perioperative physicians together with their surgical partners and by that could help reducing the problem of ' failure to rescue'. Here, an interdisciplinary project could work on that question. 6 4.2.2.7. Uncertainty with the handling of complications The interviews showed that even senior physicians of anaesthesiology departments felt challenged when facing a severe complication. This goes for legal advice as well as questions around proper communicating with the patient/relatives. A 24/7 helpline, a professional network of peers available for advice or a training course should be considered to deal with that problem. 4.2.3. Safety Practice in Anaesthesiology 4.2.3.1. Marking of the surgical site The WHO safe- surgery checklist requires the surgical site to be marked by the surgeon. This mark is a true problem in an era of more and more patients coming to the hospital on the day of surgery. In such conditions the process of reliably marking the surg ical site is not clear and easy because the surgeon involved often already is operating while his/her next patient comes to the hospital in the meantime. Now the question arises whom under which conditions should do the marking of the surgical site. This u ncertainty is a true safety hazard and should be eliminated by a joint decision between all the involved process partners in hospitals. 4.2.3.2. ' Second victim ' concepts The term ' Second Victim ' relates to all the aspects around dealing with the involved specialist or team after a severe complication. The interviews could demonstrate that only very few hospitals do have concepts/recommendations about how to proper handle this problem. Patient Safety Switzerland has published very useful recommendations and these documents should be promoted/made available in all medical facilities in Switzerland20. 4.2.3.3. Interpersonal competence Team communication, coordination, decision- making etc. are basic and highly safety - relevant concepts in modern health care. The interviews could demonstrate that only very few hospitals have training courses available for these aspects of safet y- management. FMH as well as the SIWF should make these competencies mandatory in medical education. Courses and course concepts are available and should be promoted/be made mandatory21. 5. Personal view and conclusion Anaesthesiology today in Switzerland is still very safe and delivered with highest quality. But this quality is more and more endangered by increasing economic pressures which may lead to threats on staffing levels as well as shortcuts in processes. Certain as pects must be watched carefully (threats to reporting systems; medication problems; patient selection and proper preparation; complication management including ' second victim ' problems as well as ' failure to rescue') while others must be developed (outcome parameters must be defined, and registries installed; mandatory team -training established; rules for ' closed- claims ' analysis groups defined). Overall, the role of the Anaesthesiologist must be kept in focus, as they are among the most important (but often hidden) pillars of safety in hospitals. 7 6. Recommendations (Immediate priorities in bold and marked with an *) . 6.1. Anaesthesiology specific 6.1.1. Appropriate numbers of staffing* should be defined and must not be fallen short of. This goes for the routine clinical management as well as for the staffing needed for emergencies as well as on- duty schemes in hospitals. 6.1.2. Special care must be taken to guarantee the number of sufficient well -trained experts (nurses and doctors) in anaesthesiology in the future. This is a difficult task and not limited to Anaesthesiology at all. But concepts as well funding for the next generation must be appropriate. 6.1.3. The role of the anaesthesiologist as an equal partner to the surgical colleague must be kept in focus and critical decisions must be done interdisciplinary. The scope of the responsibilities of the Anaesthesiologist must not be limited to the operating room but expanded to whole peri -operative process where Anaesthesiologists might also be considered as 'perioperative physicians', like in other countries (e.g. the United Kingdom etc.). This could help addressing the imminent problem of 'failure to rescue' on the wards. 6.2. Medication related 6.2.1. Larger stock of essential medication* (to be defined) or a well -organized exchange- network between hospitals/drug -suppliers should be considered. A shortfall of essential medications like antibiotics, opioids or Propofol is a major threat to safety. 6.2.2. The problem of ' off-label -use' of medications must be tackled in a way that fulfils the requirements of the regulator as well as of the practitioner. 6.3. General recommendations 6.3.1. Closed claims analysis committees should be established in all medical disciplines because these cases do have an immense potential for improvement. Today, most of these cases do not find their way to the specialists and stay on the desk on the people involved. All legal reports should fulfil certain quality -criteria (like 4 -eyes-principle for every legal report etc.) and must be made available, anonymously. 6.3.2. Outcome parameters must be defined, and systematic registries should be implemented that would allow for benchmarking and learning. 6.3.3. The labour law should be adapted to the special needs of hospitals in order to reduce the number of shift -handovers between specialists (which is prone for 8 complications). 6.3.4. Established concepts of dealing with ' Second Victims ' should be made available and followed in every hospital. 6.3.5. Courses for the interpersonal competence and team -work should be mandatory during medical education and sub -specialty training (in analogy to mandatory courses for radiation- safety). 6.3.6. Reporting systems must have a proper legal frame* . The current uncertainties to the confidentiality of these reporting systems may lead to a severe deterioration of the general safety -culture in healthcare. 9 7. Addendum 7.1. References 1.

While the financial focus is on expensive inpatient treatment, there is a considerable lack of resources for outpatient and intermediary psychiatric care, largely due to the dual financing modalities. Clear indicators of insufficient quality assurance in mental health care are a life expectancy of 10 to 15 years below the average for people with mental health issues, persistent stigmatisation of mental disorders, a disproportionately high number of emergency detentions to inpatient units and a high level of (non- assisted) suicide. This report focuses on suggestions to improve mental health care in Switzerland, such as redirecting the monetary flow, equal treatment of physical and mental health issues, better prevention and early detection of mental disorders, ensuring an adequate supply of easily accessible intermediary psychiatric care, broadening education regarding mental health topics for general practitioners and care personnel , as well as integrated care for physical and mental problems. Introduction This report by the Pro Mente Sana foundation was produced by invitation of the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) as part of the Swiss National Report on Safety and Quality of Healthcare. The Pro Mente Sana foundation is geared to a trialogue ( i.e. represents the interests of people with a mental illness, their carers and mental health specialists ); the short report authored by Dr Thomas Ihde- Scholl and Prof. Wulf R\u00f6ssler presents the results of a round table discussion with survivors, mental health specialists, representatives of patient organisations and psychological therapists. Held on 6 December 2018 in Bern, it was moderated by Roger Staub, CEO of Pro Mente Sana, and documented by Christine Klingler. Question 1 What is known about the safety, quality and efficiency of mental healthcare in Switzerland? In 2017 there was a total of 281 hospitals with 38,157 beds in Switzerland, of which around 18% (51) were psychiatric care facilities accounting for approximately 17% (6,573) of the total number of beds.1 A total of 36,900 doctors were active, an average of 4.3 per 1,000 inhabitants . Among all physicians, specialists in psychiatry and psychotherapy take the second 1 https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/de/home/statistiken/gesundheit/gesundheitswesen/spitaeler/infrastruktur - beschaeftig ung-finanzen.html ; last accessed on 28 December 2018. 3 place after general practi tioners . According to the OECD, Switzerland has around 42 psychiatrists per 100,000 head of population2, with a similar number of psychological psychotherapis ts. Although this puts Switzerland among the top- ranking industrial nations in terms of the density of outpatient and inpatient care, people are not guaranteed equal access to care. Smaller cantons have access to inpatient facilities run by larger cantons remote from the community (rather than the corresponding wards in their own general hospitals), but they must make compensation payments for this privilege. Psychiatrists and psychotherapists prefer to settle in urban areas . This means that by the standards of modern community psychiatric care, large sections of the population are clearly undersupplied with psychiatric and psychotherapeutic services. Quality assurance In the field of outpatient psychiatry and psychology there is a lack of comprehensive quality assurance conducted in accordance with scientific standards. On the inpatient side, the ANQ (Swiss National Association for Quality Development in Hospitals) regularly gathers data on quali ty. Data gathering Obsan and the ANQ regularly gather data. There is, however, no uniform presentation of the system and the long -term use of psychiatric services. Nevertheless, there are certain indicators of a lack of quality and safety. Indicators of a lack of quality in care in general Inappropriate care . Resources are not deployed appropriately, with the focus on very expensive inpatient care and on services provided by doctors on an outpatient basis, and on delegated psychotherapy (psychologists cooperating with psychiatrists). At the same time, low -threshold and intermediate care is insufficiently developed. (\"Intermediate care\" is defined as outpatient and partial hospitalisation services geared to people in acute crisis or people with complex or chronic mental problems. Some of this care is provided on an outreach basis, and as a rule, it is closely networked with other support organisations in the sphere of the people affected.) There is thus a lack of care in the form of the kind of sociothera py these days taken for granted as part of a moder n integrated community psychiatry -based care system, as well as a lack of outpatient (acute) psychiatric services, for example day -clinic care or acute psychiatric home treatment. Virtually all outpatient s ervices depend on patients getting to the service provider . As well as being very expensive, the current care offerings do not meet the demands of modern care that gives those affected the greatest possible degree of autonomy and co- determination. The present structures are paternalistic and geared to traditional models of medical care. 2 OECD, Mental Health and Work: Switzerland. Contributions to the social security series, research report no. 12/13: www.bsv.admin.ch Praxis Forschung Forschungsberichte. 4 Failure to implement the notion of \" outpatient has precedence over inpatient care\". The current dual funding set -up runs counter to systematic implementation: the cantons provide 55% of the funding for psychiatric hospitals while all outpatient treatments, including many day -clinic services, are funded exclusively by providers of mandatory health ins urance (some cantons finance day -clinic services as a voluntary measure). Health insurers thus have no interest in reducing the number of beds, which is why there is a comparatively high number of beds in Switzerland. Furthermore, partial hospitalisation programs do not have a secured funding since they are not considered essential in health legislation. Undersupply . This affects children, young people, young adults and the elderly, who often find no place for treatment. Most mental health problems occur up to age 25, which is a particularly sensitive time in terms of people's professional and personal development.3 Undersupply also affects neglected, vulnerable groups on the periphery: people living in poverty, homeless people, people with addictions, those with chronic mental health problems, people with comorbid problems (suffering physical and mental problems simultaneously), migrants (especially refugees), and so on. Consequences of a lack of quality in care Emergency detention. The number of emergency detentions in Switzerland is high. Although there are large differences from region to region, an average of one out of five inpatients is there on the basis of involuntary commitment.4 Given that sectioned care should only be used as a measure o f last resort, this is a clear indication of a lack of properly developed (intermediate) structures. Life expectancy . As is also the case internationally, the life expectancy of people with mental health problems in Switzerland is 10 to 15 years shorter than average - a fact little known and rarely discussed outside specialist circles. There are many reasons for this. First and foremost is the high suicide rate among people with chronic mental illness who no longer see any perspective in their life. Between 10% and 15% of people suffering from major depression and schizophrenia commit suicide in the course of their illness. Added to this, physical healthcare for people with mental problems is gravely neglected. By the same token, the psychiatric care of people with physical illnesses is similarly neglected. There is abundant evidence that neglect of mental problems suffered by people with physical illnesses (such as diabetes, cardiovascular and oncological diseases) significantly worsens the long -term cours e of their physical illness. All this is clear proof that the separation of physical and mental healthcare (reflected among other things by the fact that there are psychiatric wards in only very few Swiss general hospitals) results in inequality of treatment, violating the principle of equal opportunity in healthcare. 3 von Wyl, A., Chew Howard, E., Bohleber, L. & Haemmerle, Psychische Neuch\u00e2tel: Schweizerisches Gesundheitsobservatorium (page 30). 4 Schuler, D., Tuch, A. & Peter, C. (2018). F Suicide rate . Suicide rates in Switzerland are very high, with suicide being the cause of 30 in every 1,000 cases of death (16 non- assisted, 14 assisted suicides).5 Between 1995 and 2016 there was a steady rise in the number of non- assisted suicides per 100,000 head of population, particularly among the very elderly (aged 85+). In 2015, there were 1,071 suicides in total (792 males, 279 females)6. One of the factors contributing to the high number of suicides in Switzerland is the availability of firearms. Switzerland has the second highest rate of suicides with firearms after the United States. Freedom of choice - autonomy - recovery. The desire of those affected and their families for greater freedom of choice when it comes to treatment is also a result of the lack of low -threshold services. Fundamentally those affected want to be treated as close as possible to where they live with as few restrictions as possible on their personal life. This is precisely why outpatient healthcare should be favoured over inpatient care: because it gives patients as much autonomy as possible, and not because there are potential cost savings. It is the impression of Pro Mente Sana t hat s ocietal trends such as self - determination, a rejection of paternalistic structures, a focus on recovery, prevention, involving additional complementary approaches such as phytotherapy, nutrition, etc., are being translated into practice only very slow ly and on a rudimentary basis. Financial incentives that would speed up implementation of some of these things are lacking. Patient rights in clinics The number of involuntary commitments in Switzerland is high. Added to this, in psychiatric facilities freedom -limiting measures often do not conform with basic human rights, as can be read in detail in the 2016 annual report of the National Committee for the Prevention of Torture (NKVF).7 This is the case even though there are regulations governing state oversight of psychiatric facilities; this duty is not sufficiently respected. Also noteworthy are increasing complaints by patients of a lack of language skills among healthcare personnel in a medical discipline whose main therapeutic tool is spoken communication. This is detrimental to the recovery process.8 Funding Psychiatric care in Switzerland is exceedingly well provided with resources by international standards. However, these resources are used primarily for traditional 5 https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/de/home/statistiken/gesundheit/gesundheitswesen/spitaeler/infrastruktur - beschaeftigung-finanzen.html ; last accessed on 28 December 2018. 6 https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/de/home/statistiken/gesundheit/gesundheitszustand/psychische.html#par_ headline_1677393895 ; last accessed on 28 December 2018. 7 NKVF annual report, https://www.nkvf.admin.ch/dam/data/nkvf/Berichte/taetigkeitsberichte/2016/taetigkeitsbericht -2016-d.pdf (pp. 29 -53); last accessed on 28 December 2018. 8 Written communication from Bruno Facci, president of VASK Switzerland (umbrella association for relatives of the mentally ill), 30 November 2018. 6 services and facilities. In Switzerland, the priority is on building the most expensive comp onent of care, a very good inpatient care system. Compared with other countries Switzerland also has a large number of very cost -intensive institutional assisted living and working environments, where people generally stay a long time or even their whole l ife. There is a lack of community -based and individualized assisted or supported living and working arrangements , which are also less costly . The goal however should not be to make psychiatric care cheaper, but to use the available resources for a modern, diversified care integrated in the community. Question 2 What has been done so far to improve the safety, quality and efficiency of mental healthcare in Switzerland? Here is a n overview of improvements in recent years: - People increasingly see depression as stress -related (which is why it is more frequently referred to as burnout, a less stigmatised term). The stigma attached to schizophrenia, by contrast, has increased.9 - The peer model has been expanded. In German- speaking Switzerland, around 200 peers have been trained to date, and a large number of them have found part -time positions (full -time in individual cases) in psychiatric facilities. Peer work, however, is not yet part of standard care. - The federal disability insurance's (IV/A I) integration programs (early registration and job counselling ) are a good start , but they are too short for the recovery process, and procedures jeopardise recovery. Not only that, but mentally ill people receiving disability benefits are stigmatised ( \"fake\" disabled people). Those who do not get a disability pension (with such narrow criteria there are many of them) fall out of the system and are at a great risk of becoming long -term recipients of social welfare. - The compensation for disadvantages ( \"Nach teilsausgleich \") that has now been put in place gives children and young people with congenital disorders and mental health problems better educational and training opportunities. This is one of the few steps in efforts to achieve equality for people with disability that has been successful. - Favouring outpatient over inpatient care is basically a step in the right direction, but there is no financial framework to make it happen systematically (closure of day clinics, see above, while numerous inpatient wards are being opened in various cantons). - Many health policies (for example from the cantons) mention recovery as a principle of healthcare. - Around ten years ago there was a wave of innovation and good pilot projects (for example in the field of home treatm ent), but few of them have been implemented because of a lack of funding. - The FOPH is increasingly commissioning studies and inviting advocacy organisations to contribute their opinions. 9 Angermeyer, M., Matschinger, H., Schomerus, G. (2013). Attitudes towards psychiatric treatment and people with mental illness: changes over two decades. In: British Journal of Psychiatry, Vol. 203, Issue 2, pp. 146- 151. 7 - Politicians are more aware of mental health problems and mental health, which is leading to a launch of many projects and reports. - Many psychiatric institutions now have guidelines to promote empowerment . There are also more open wards, and psychotherapy wards have been set up. There are more speci alised day clinics, specialist consultation opportunities as part of outpatient services, and outreach teams. - Psychopharmacology: There is slightly more openness towards phytotherapy, something primarily desired by those affected, but there is still scope for increasingly combining psychopharmacology and complementary medicine. Question 3 What have been the obstacles and challenges in terms of attempts to bring about improvements? Barriers at the social and political level Lack of equality between phys ical and mental healthcare. Stigmatisation of mental health problems (despite the change in attitudes towards depression described above) has implications for the funding of the various services. There is no equality in the healthcare planning and health l egislation of the different cantons either. Vicious circle of mental illness and poverty. Mental health problems are a risk factor for poverty, and at the same time poverty is a risk factor for mental problems. This vicious circle could be addressed through integrated health and social care. 40% of all recipients of social welfare suffer from a high degree o f psychological stress, which makes occupational reintegration more difficult. Especially counterproductive are cost -cutting measures in social welfare (SKOS) and moving those affected between the various insurance schemes. Politically motivated agitation . Pro Mente Sana feels that stigmatisation has been increased by certain political groups focusing excessively on the alleged abuse of medical benefit systems. These campaigns have targeted mainly patients with illnesses that are not visible, i.e. primaril y mental illnesses. Societal trends. Everyone is talking about inclusion, but the sustained trend to greater autonomy and individualisation is actually moving society towards greater exclusion. A large number of institutional living and working facilities exclude mentally ill people from participating in society. There are no particular efforts to promote integration in the primary labour market (supported employment). In the secondary labour market, there is a lack of incentive to move away from vested interests. Barriers at the legislative and funding level 8 Dual funding of outpatient/inpatient care. Dual funding is counterproductive when it comes to favouring outpatient over inpatient care (see above) and the greatest obstacle to developing a modern mental healthcare system in Switzerland. Lack of legal regulation for intermediate psychiatry. Interm ediate psychiatry is not recognised at the legislative level as necessary for care, which also means no money has to be made available for it. Prevention. Funds are barely available to promote the mental health of the public in Switzerland. The preventive health act has failed for the time being. There are few sanctions on the consumption of traditional and legal addictive substances (first and foremost alcohol), and substances such as cannabis are to be legalised. Obstacles at the level of treatment Gatekeeper role of general practitioners. General practitioners (GPs or family doctors) are the first point of contact for people with mental health problems , and are decisive to achieving the desired equality between physical and mental care. However, psychi atric care is given too little emphasis in training, so GPs are still primarily focused on physical care. There is a lack of incentives to take a holistic view, or the incentives available are counter productive, for example because longer discussions with patients cannot be billed. Lack of information on what is on offer. People with mental problems are unable to find out which specialists are competent for what, so it is largely a matter of chance who they end up with. Psycholog ical psychotherapy other than delegated therapy . Low-threshold access to non-delegated psycholog ical psychotherapy is impeded because there is no model of how it is prescribed and funded, and the service is not covered by basic health insurance. Separation between physical and mental healthcare. 40% of people with chronic physical conditions also suffer from mental problems, and 60% of those with chronic mental illness also have physical ailments. With such high percentages of comorbid patients, the separation of physical and mental healthcare is not productive, and is probably part of the cause of the low life expectancy of people with mental illness. Preliminary and follow -up care . The offering of services before and after inpatient care is inadequate. Elective admissions are very rare in inpatient psychiatric care; most are emergency admissions. This in spite of the fact that most admissions are quite foreseeable. In most cases, admissions occur when the social and medical support systems fail, usually at the weekend or shortly before. Many inpatient admissions are unnecessary and could be prevented with structures to provide appropriate help. At the same time, there is a lack of structures for subsequent care to help patients reintegrate after they are released from inpatient treatment. 9 Question 4 What other improvements do we recommend? Funding- related measures Unitary set-up of funding. Services will only evolve if funding is geared accordingly. Dual funding (see above), as it is handled at present, is the greatest obstacle to the development of a modern mental healthcare system in Switzerland. What is urgently required is funding for outpatient and inpatient care borne equally by health insurers and the cantons. Equality o f physical and mental healthcare. Physical and mental health should be recognised as equal and given equal funding. This also applies to training (see above). Integrated care. There is an urgent need for integrated care for comorbid patients and financial incentives to provide integrated care. However, this demand also covers integrated care with nursing, psychological and psychiatric services in equal measure to enable graduated, diversified care. Strengthening prevention and early detection/treatment . Prevention, early detection and early therapy have to be made more financially attractive. This also makes (macro)economic sense, because it is a way of preventing treatment from becoming expensive and costs arising in other areas as well.10 Reinforcing lo w-threshold and intermediate psychiatric care. There is a need for more low-threshold, crisis -oriented care provided on an outreach basis, a prescribing model and basic insurance cover for psycholog ical psychotherapy beyond delegated psychotherapy, and more peer work. Desirable would be an arrangement whereby the FOPH steers care by issuing target requirements to the cantonal departments of health. Improvements in care Promoting person- centered care. Patients requiring multimodal care need better continuity of treatment based on a human -centric as opposed to an institution- centered approach; rather than patients having to change institutions in the course of their treatment, the required provision of care should adapt to the patient s' needs regardless of the institution. 10 Schuler, D., Tuch, A., Buscher, N. & Camenzind, P. (2016). Psychische Gesundheit in der chweiz. Monitoring 2016 (Obsan report 72). Neuch\u00e2tel: Schweizerisches Gesundheitsobservatorium. 10 Improve care for minorities. Migrants (especially refugees), elderly people, children and young adults, people without an education, people with addiction disorders , and, above all, p olymorbid people, partly with chronic mental illness, must have access to appropriate treatment. Peer involvement. Peers should be involved across the board at all levels. Labour market integration. Sustainable integration in the primary labour market should be promoted via supported employment , incentives for employers and the federal disability insurance, which should facilitate the integration on the first labour market . Social safety net. Society should provide people with serious mental illness w ith a real safety net in the form of social security and insurance schemes that allow them to live their life in dignity and participate in society, without having to struggle to secure their basic needs. Improvements in training General practitioners . Basic and advanced training for GPs should cover physical and mental disease equally so that these doctors can give comprehensive advice to people seeking help with mental health problems, including on medication. Medical training has to include better trai ning in communication skills. Improvements in quality assurance Emergency treatment . Involuntary admissions must be regulated in such a way that only specialists in psychiatry can make referrals, or referrals must be authorised by a superior authority (for example the Basel -Stadt model, where referrals are subject to confirmation by the cantonal medical officer ). Emergency admissions are a very severe measure restricting peoples' freedom, and should only be applied under very strict and legal ly regulated criteria. Added to this, coercive measures during inpatient treatment must be defined more precisely and transparently. Procedures should be introduced to ensure that follow -up discussions are held with those affected to explain the reason for and purpos e of the treatment against their will. At the moment there are also no regulatory measures for so-called informal coercion, where the people affected are put under pressure to show good conduct in the desired psychiatric sense in return for specific benef its or deliverables. Better quality and outcome orientation. First gather data, then link it with funding: this is how funding should be allocated to services that prove to be effective. Scientific quality assurance. There is a need for comprehensive quality assurance for all forms of psychiatric and psychological treatment and facilities on the basis of health technology assessment (HTA) instruments and the latest scientific insights. 11 Quality controls on disability insurance experts. Even though they make decisions with immense implications, the medical experts who examine patients on behalf of the IV/AI are in some cases inadequately trained. This is an area where appropriate quality control is urgently needed. Take on ideas from abroad. Insights from successful attempts to improve provision of care in other countries should be adopted more rapidly. Improvements in treatment Respectful approach. It would be desirable for those affected and their families to be increasingly involved at all levels, and for professionals to drop their paternalistic attitudes. This would be an expression of dealing with people on equal terms and respecting their dignity . People with mental health problems should have a say in their own treatment and be able to choose from several treatment options. They should be taken seriously if they complain of physical problems. Timely referral to specialists . Patients being treated by general practitioners should be referred to specialists in psychiatry if there is no improvement in their psychiatric condition. Integrated physical and mental healthcare. There is an urgent need for integrated care for comorbid patients. The separation between physical and mental healthcare should be overcome. Increased combination of traditional and alternative medicine. Alternative medical measures address widespread wis hes among those affected. Quality improvement in primary care - Chiolero & Rodondi 17.01.2019 1 Swiss National Report on Quality and Safety in Healthcare Quality improvement in primary care: toward the provision of safe, high value , patient - centered, sustainable, and data-informed care Authors Prof Arnaud Chiolero, MD PhD1,2,3, Prof Nicolas Rodondi , MD Health Care ( BIHAM ), Unive rsity of Bern, Switzerland ; 2) Depart ment of Epidemiol ogy, Biostatistics, and Occupational Health, McGill University, Montreal, Canada ; 3) Population Health Laboratory, University of Fribourg, Switzerland; 4) Department of General Internal Medicine, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern, Switzerland Conflict of interest AC and NR have no conflict of interest to declare. Abstract In Switzerland, due to the growth and ageing of population, primary health care needs are increasing , especially for the management of chronic diseases and multimorbidity . Physician s are keen to improve the quality of care for their patients, and s everal inspiring initiatives have been conducted to monitor or improve the quality and safety of primary care in Switzerland. However, most of these ini tiatives were local and not funded on a sustained basis. Currently, there is no comprehensive approach of quality improvement ( QI) in primary care and t he culture of QI remains relatively weak, especially regarding monitor ing and external accountability . There has never been a national QI program in primary care. Further, there is no national monitoring of quality and safety in primary care , including to track low value care and linked avoidable healthcare costs . We therefore recommend building a national strategy aiming to ( 1) set up a monitoring system for the quality and safety of primary care, ( 2) strengthen a culture of QI in primary care, ( 3) im prove the quality of primary care through evidence -based and monitored interventions, (4) reduce low value care, and (5) support experim ents to test QI initiatives. This strategy should be defined with citizens, patients, primary care physicians, allied health care providers (e.g., pharmacists), experts in health monitoring, health insurers , and health authorities, under the aegis of medic o-scientific institutions with expertise in primary care as well as healthcare research and monitoring. Such a strategy would be key toward the provision of safe, high value, patient -centered, sustainable, and data -informed care . Quality improvement in primary care - Chiolero & Rodondi 17.01.2019 2 1. Context In Switzerland, due to the growth and ageing of population, primary health care needs are increasing . Indeed, because the frequency of chronic conditions increase s with age, the ageing of the population means that a growing number of citizens have chronic diseases requiring primary care. Furthermore, many patients have several conditions. As a result, managing multimorbidity and polypharmacy are a major daily task of primary care physicians [1, 2]. It implies a growing complexity of care, also because primary care physician have to account for patients' soci al and e conomic constraints . In parallel to these demographic changes and related medical issues , there is concern about a shortage of primary care physicians in Switzerland [3]. Indeed, due notably to the ageing of physician s, the increasing proportion of physicians working part time, and the insufficient number of new primary care physician s, the primary care workforce is shrinking. T here are some regions in Swi tzerland , especially in rural areas, where the density of primary care physicians is relatively low . Another major change is the dev elopment of group practice and hospital ambulatory care and the disappearance of solo primary care physicians . Also changing are the roles of patients and the implication of allied healthcare professionals. Patients are indeed becoming key partners, calling for the development of patient -centered care [4, 5], and t here is a growi ng role of pharmacists , nurses , and other allied health professional s for the provision of ambulatory care [6]. Final ly, insuring equity in care access are becoming a major issue as a growing share of the population is postponing care for economic reasons [7]. 2. Toward a patient -centered, sustainable, and value- based primary care In Switzerland, healthcare - including primary care - is traditionally physician -centered and essentially based on a fee -for-services funding [3] . Current trends are to shift toward a patient - centered and value- based healthcare system [ 5, 8, 9]. Patient -centered care focus es on patient s' health care needs and preferences, through patients' empowerment to become active participants in their care and insurance that their values guide clini cal decisions [ 9]. Shared - decision making defined as \"an approach where clinicians and patients make decisions together using the best available evidence\" [ 10] is one tool for patient -centered care. Value based healthcare \"aims to increase the value that is derived from the resources available for a population\" [ 8]. Inadequate use of healthcare resources is frequent, with soaring overdiagnosis, overtreatment, and provision of low value care [ 11-13]. Due to rising healthcare costs, a better use of resources through a reduction of low value care is necessary to insure the long-term sustainability of healthcare system [3]. Key is to provide the right care to the right patient [ 13], and primary care physicians are central in this process. In many countries worldwide, \"Choosing Wisely\" initiatives have burgeoned to identify and prevent use of low value procedures or treatments. In Switzerland, the initiative is led under the aegis o f \"Smarter Medicine- Choosing Wisely Switzerland\" [ 14]. A pay -for-performance scheme could be one financial way to shift toward a value -based healthcare system [ 15, 16 ]. Rather than being paid based on a fee -for-service scheme, primary care physicians are paid accounting for the quality of their service. It require s a monitoring system allowing evaluate performance through (evidence- based) indicators. A pay -for- performance scheme was introduced in the United Kingdom what was a major driver for the Quality improvement in primary care - Chiolero & Rodondi 17.01.2019 3 development of QI in primary care [17, 18]. The impact on the quality of care is however highly debated [ 18], with a growing disenchantment with such scheme [ 17, 19]. In Switzerland, one trial is ongoing to test the effectiveness of a p ay-for-performance program on the quality of care of patients with diabetes [ 20]. 3. Culture of quality improvement in primary care in Switzerland The field of quality and safety in primary care is broad and multidimensional, and there are multiple areas for quality improvement ( QI) [21]. Based on the \"Quality Improvement Competencies Framework\" proposed by Czabanowska et al. to identify competencies that should acquire future primary care (family medicine) physicians, QI encompasses the following areas: 1) patient care and safety, 2) equity and ethical practice, 3) effectiveness and efficiency, 4) methods and tools (notably for data- informed care), 5) continuing professional education, and 6) leadership and management (for more details , see Appendix 1 ) [21] . In Switzerland, the culture of QI in healthcare remains relatively weak by comparison with countries like the Netherland or United Kingdom [3]. For the provision of care in hospitals, QI culture has slowly grown in the last 20 years, notably through the development of quality of health care indicators at a national level and the implementation of critical incident reporting systems (CIRS) [ 22, 23]. This development was favored notably by the legal surveillance of hospital by cantonal authorities and the growing competition between hospitals. A key driver was the Swiss National Association for Quality Development in Hospitals and Clinics (ANQ) , building a whole set of quality of care indicators [22]. Finally, several national QI programs in hospitals have been supported by the Federal office of public health (FOPH). By contrast, no such development in QI has occurred at a national level in ambulatory care, and notably in primary care. Primary care physicians are keen to improve the quality of care at an individual level. However, they are less comfortable with e.g. standardization of care, healthcare monitor ing, and external accountability, notably due to insufficient training and lack of experience in QI. While there are several - most often local or c antonal - initiatives to improve the quality of ambulatory care (see below), there is no well -defined and sustained QI strategy in primary care at the national level. One major weakness is the lack of monitoring of the quality of care in ambulatory care. Further, the Federal office public health (FOPH) has never supported a national QI program in primary care. 4. Initiatives to monitor or improve the quality and safety of primary care in Switzerland : toward safe, data-informed, and high value care Assessing t he quality of primary care is necessary for QI and for the provision of data -informed healthcare [4, 21]. It is key to distinguish measurements for improvement and accountability. In Switzerland, s everal inspiring initiatives have been conducted to monitor or improve the quality and safety of primary care, and some of these initiatives are listed below . 4.1. Incident reporting Incident reporting is a classical tool to improve safety in primary care. It is based usually on voluntary and anonymous report s of physicians or allied health care professionals. There are however several issues related to this type of reporting, notably the difficulty of having a standard and use ful definition of incidents, how to insure that all incidents have been repor ted, Quality improvement in primary care - Chiolero & Rodondi 17.01.2019 4 the amount of inf ormation about each incident needed, and if this data can be used or not for legal inquiries. In Switzerland, critical incident reporting systems (CIRS) are used in hospitals [23]. In several cantons, hospitals have to implement CIRS to be on the cantonal hospital lists (for reimbursement) . A CIRS for ambulatory care was proposed initially by the Swiss Society of General Medicine (SGIM) in 2002, and subsequently led by the Coll\u00e8ge des m\u00e9decins de premie r recours (CMPR) [ 24]. However, it was successfully implemented. Over several years of activity, o nly 3-6 incident s were reported annually . Currently, there is no CIRS at a national level in Switzerland for primary health care. Some studies assessed the frequency of incidents in primary care in Switzerland. In a large physician network including 472 primary care offices in the German part of Switzerland , the frequency of primary care safety incidents and associated harms were assessed in a cross - sectional survey of 630 physicians and nurses [ 25]. 30% of physicians and 17% of nurses reported that at least one incident occurred daily or weekly in their offices. On average, each responders reported that 92 incidents had occurred in the last 12 months. Documentation of the incident was often lacking. In the same study, medication safety, triaging patient at the initial contact, and drug inter action were the perceived safety threats most often cited [ 26]. Time pressure and poor office organization process were also identified as important safety threats. Finally, safety climate was perceived as higher in medical center compared to single- handed office, if there was regular team meeting, and if physicians participat ed to quality circle s [27]. Data from Sent inella system were also used to inform patient safety in primary care [28]. Sentinella is a surveillance network of physicians in Switzerland . In 2015, medication incidents were assessed over one year among 180 general practitioners and pediatricians . The mean rate of detected incidents was 2.1 pe r general practitioner per year, corresponding to a rate of 47 per 100'000 patients ' encounter . Among pe diatricians, the mean rate was 0.15 per year, corresponding to a rate of 3 per 100'000 patients' encounters. Incidents were more frequent among older and multimorbid patients. Many incidents were linked to communication issues. 4.2. Q uality of care monitoring and indicators Monitor ing the quality of care, allowing data feedback and benchmarking through indicators , is a central element of QI including in primary care [ 29, 30 ]. The project \"Swiss Primary Care Monitoring\" (SPAM) aimed to monitor all aspect s of the activities and performance of primary care physicians [ 31, 32]. Through a consensus approach, 56 priority indicators could be defined based on various data sources, including original data collect ed in a large national network of primary care physicians. SPAM includes several quality of care indicators. Major issues were the heterogeneity in the quality of data to build indicators and the heavy burden to gather this data. While d ata for structure indicators was of relatively high quality, data for outcomes indicators was almost non- existent [32]. Recently, evidence -based quality of care indicators were produced taking advantage of health insurance claims data from ambulatory care , based on pre -existing foreign clinical practice guidelines and an on informal expert consensus process [33]. Some 24 indicators were developed covering the domains of efficiency, drug safety, geriatric care, respiratory disease, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. This data is available nationwide and allows both cross - sectional and longitudinal evaluations on dif ferent levels (p atients, system). However, their validity and implementation in practice remains to be evaluated [33]. Quality improvement in primary care - Chiolero & Rodondi 17.01.2019 5 Using clinical data of 1781 patients with diabetes extracted f rom electronic medical records of Swiss general practitioners (as part of the Swiss FIRE project) , some quality of care indicators, inspired by the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) , could be produced [ 34]. However, a high amount of missing data made it impossible to evaluate quality of care. S tandard ization of data collection in electronic medical records would be necessary to use them to build quality of care indicators . Of growing importance are person- focused assessment of quality rather than disease- focus assessment [4, 35]. Health indicators accounting for patients' perspective , such as patients' reported outcomes measurement (PRO Ms), are now used in several health care area, including primary care [ 35]. Tools are available to measure patients' perceived health status, functional status or health -related quality of life . The Swiss Medical Association ( FMH ) support s the implementation of PRO Ms [36]. 4.3 Quality circle Quality circle is one major tool for QI in primary care in Switzerland [37, 38]. It consists in small group of 6 to 12 health care professional s (physicians and e.g. pharmacists) , working in the same region or locality, and meeting regularly to reflect and improve their practice [39]. They meet on a voluntary basis. In some regions, they share data and indicators , e.g., about prescription patterns and costs , allowing feedback and local benchmarking [40, 41]. They play an important role in QI in primary care. In Switzerland, around 80% of primary care physicians are involved in quality circles [ 37]. The Swiss Society of General Internal Medicine (SSGIM) support s quality circles [42]. For more information about quality circle s, see Appendix 2. 4.4 Other initiatives The certification of heath care activities and process is a standard tool of QI. In Switzerland, the EQUAM (Externe QUAlit\u00e4tsf\u00f6rderung in der Medizin) foundation proposes certifications for some activities led by primary care physicians (e.g., hypertension management) [ 43]. For more information, see the chapter devoted to EQUAM in the current national report . In 2012, the FMH has constituted the l'Acad\u00e9mie suisse pour la qualit\u00e9 en m\u00e9decine (ASQM) to help coordinate numerous QI initiatives [44]. A quality chart er was developed with three pillars 1) transparency : make physicians' activities visible to promote quality in medicine and quality of medical services ; 2) m andatory : signatory medical organizations develop a quality strategy and regularly review the situation in a quality report ; 3) s ustainability : the quality strategy is a long -term strategy and quality procedures are an integral part of the pregraduate, postgraduate , and continuous training of doctors. Quality of care is improved through the reduction of low value care and through a greater involvement of patients . In 2018, the Swiss Society of General Internal Medicine (SSGIM) has defined two priority areas for its quality strategy [45]: 1) smarter medicine -Choosing wisely Switzerland [14] and 2) shared decision- making. Along these areas, pilot projects are planned to improve the care of multimo rbid patients and could be tested within quality circles networks.

This strategy should be defined under the aegis of medico -scientific institutions with expertise in primary care as well as healthcare research and monitoring . Such a strategy would be key toward the provision of safe, high value, patient - centered , sustainable, and data -informed care .

For the current report, we used the \" Quality Improvement Competencies Framework \" proposed by Czabanowska et al. to identify competencies that should acquire future primary care (family medicine) physicians for QI in various areas [ 21]. In this framework, QI encompasses the areas listed in the Table 2: Table 2: Areas for QI in primary care (adapted from Czabanowska et al. 2012 [21]). Areas Features Patient care and safety Provision of patient centered care; deal with critical incidents and medical error; infection prevention; medication safety; system approach and communication to improve patient safety; health care plan. Equity and ethical practice Analysis of equity of practice performance; respect patient autonomy and personal rights; manage patient data safely and ethically; understand intercultural patients' concern; address ethical dilemmas; understand soc ial context; prioritize QI activity Effectiveness and efficiency Standardize service delivery to improve timeliness; measure practice performance; implement evidence based medicine; ensure data quality; manage resource efficiently; promote methods of continuous improvement; standardize QI process Methods and tools Use the plan-do-check -act (PDCA ) quality circle; understand change management; measure performance and use data for improvement and accountability; use benchmark feedback and audit techniques in the context of your practice and region. Continuing professional education Use self -assessme nt; maintain individual continuing learning; pursue systematic practice based learning and improvement; engage in interprofessional learning. Leadership and management Work in partnership; work as an interprofessional team, in a practice, in a network, an d in the community; understand how to take or delegate leadership for QI; negotiate for change with staff and with patients This framework is comprehensive and useful to develop a comprehensive QI strategy for primary health care. Quality improvement in primary care - Chiolero & Rodondi 17.01.2019 10 Appendix 2 Quality circles in Swiss primary health care By Adrian Rohrbasser, MD, MSc1,2,3; 1) Department of Continuing Education, University of Oxford, United Kingdom .; 2) Institute of Primary Health Care (BIHAM), University of Bern, Switzerland; 3) Medbase Centre W il, Wil, Switzerland . AR is a family physician in Switzerland and PhD student at the Department of Continuing Education, University of Oxford, where he studies quality circles in primary health care. He is member of the Swiss Society of General Internal Medicine (SSGIM) committee for quality improvement (QI), and supervises and trains quality circle facilitators. 1. What quality circles are and what they do Quality circles or similar structured small groups of health professionals are learning environments, sites of continuous professional development, and interventions for QI [ 1, 2] . They are typically composed of 6 to 12 health care professionals who meet regularly to reflect on and improve their standard practice [ 3]. In Switzerland, they provide continuous medical education and continuous professional development, which are necessary for QI [ 4]. Participants choose topics, didactic methods, and techniques to improve targeted aspects of quality. Trained facilitators s upport quality circles in this process. Quality circles create a climate of trust and foster a free speech culture. Discussions of everyday problems draw on collective expertise and spark a process of mutual learning. Participants are guided by data in their efforts to improve health care delivery, addressing local problems like inefficient, harmful, or poorly -timed medical services. They are thus a bottom -up system of quality assurance and continuous QI. Participants examine and evaluate processes in thei r clinics, link evidence to everyday practice, learn to deal with uncertainty, and devise strategies for improving their practice (e.g., improving prescription habits and diagnostic strategies). They discuss and reflect on practice, which may raise their s elf-esteem. Frequent quality circles participation strengthens team- based strategies for preventing errors [ 1]. 2. The situation in Switzerland Among the 8290 physicians reporting working in primary health care in 2017 [ 5], more than 80% reported participating to quality circles as part of QI activities [ 6]. Since the European Society for Quality and Safety in Family Medicine (EQuiP) delegates introduced the technique in 1996, tutors have offered trainings in QI, including to facilitate quality circles, under th e auspices of the SSGIM; some 2 500 facilitators have been trained since then. Physicians, physiotherapists, speech therapists, occupational therapists, chiropractors, pharmacists, and practice assistants that adopted quality circles founded the Forum for Quality Circles. Its members organise yearly education meetings for facilitators. Physician networks in Switzerland are organisations that provide health services tailored to the needs of patients through binding coll aborations between physicians and health insurance companies [7]. Some 52% (4278) of primary care physicians were members of physician networks in 2017 [ 5]. Within thes e networks, quality circles are u sed for continuous professional development and QI. Qua lity circles are integrated quality measures in contracts between physician networks and insurers. Insurers offer plans that require patients first see a physician within their network, except for emergencies. Networks and insurers negotiate and sign contr acts over reimbursement for this service. Insurers require networks to show continuous improvement in quality of care they provide to patients and review performance Quality improvement in primary care - Chiolero & Rodondi 17.01.2019 11 and renegotiate contracts annually; they rank performance based on predefined measures of quality, which often include quality circles. In September 2018, the SSGIM conducted a survey to find out how often networks are contractually required to report quality circles to insurers, how many of these quality circles there are, and how many primar y care physicians participate in these quality circles . Out of the 50 networks the Swiss Association of Physicians' Networks listed on their home page, 37 (75%) responded. They reported that quality circles are a core element of QI in their practices and key to their members' continuous professional development. In this sample, all physicians belonged to quality circles through their networks. Some 219 networks' quality circles were identified and address a variety of topics. A ll reported that insurers require networks' physicians to participate in quality circles . Each n etworks collaborate s with 6 to 24 insurers. 3. Conclusion In Switzerland, physicians commonly use quality circles for continuous professional development and QI . The large number quality aspects that quality circles deal with provide s a strong basis for QI in Swiss primary health care.

Patrik Muff1 (head of committee), Dr. phil. II . Carla Meyer -Massetti2, Johanna Bouzid3, Dr. ph il. II. Markus Leopold Lampert4 The authors acknowledge the many valuable contributions from the GSASA executive board Affiliations: Spit\u00e4ler AG & Pharmaceutical Care Research Group, Universit\u00e4t Basel February 2019 2 Introduction The issue of drug- related problems came to public awareness in Switzerland ever since the interdisciplinary congress on drug- related risks and safety in hospitals , held in 20011. ADEs affect more than 6% of all inpatients2. Pertaining to the causes of ADEs, a clear distinction has to be made between errors in the medication use process (medication errors), which are a problem of medication safety, and undesired drug reactions (ADRs), which are a problem of drug product safety. Medication errors are the cause of approximately half of all drug- related complications3 and are in principle avoidable. They occur in more than 5% of all cases where drugs are administered in the hospital setting2. In Swiss hospitals and nursing homes, the so- called \"qualified person\" (i.e. Fachtechnisch verantwortliche Person, FvP), usuall y a pharmacist, is accountable for the medication use process and its safety4. On the following pages the Swiss Association of Public Health Administration and Hospital Pharmacists (GSASA) assesses medication safety in Swiss healthcare institutions based on the degree of implementation of evidence- based recommendations made by the U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM)5, supplemented with best-practice strategies for addressing current medication safety issues. This evaluation of the situation complem ents the July 2018 report on medication safety in Switzerland published by authors of the Swiss Patient Safety Foundation6, which addresses both inpatient and outpatient care, offers detailed information on quantitative medication safety data available from Switzer land and is summarized in Box 1. Box 1: Summary of significant findings and recommendations in the publication of Fishman et al. 6 In 2018, authors from the Swiss Patient Safety Foundation have published an article detailing Swiss publications on medication safety. Their findings are briefly summarized here: Available data indicates that more than 27% of patients have an ADR during their hospitalization and that 8- 15% of patients are victim of an ADE. A representative international study showed that in 2010, 5.3% of Swiss people were victim of a medication error in the last two years. 4-7% of hospital emer gency admissions are caused by ADE s. During hospital stay, a systematic CIRS analysis showed that preparation and administration of drugs are medication safety hotspots (45% of all medication errors) . Other known risk factors in the medication use process are polypharmacy and transitions of care ( e.g., hospital admission and discharge). V ulnerable patient groups are children, older and multimorbid patients , especially in nursing homes, as well as patients with language barriers . Empirical research shows tha t medication safety is an urgent area of concern in the Swiss healthcare system, but o verall, there is a lack of actual Swiss data on medication safety, specifically in ambulatory care. Furthermore, no comprehensive national strategy explicitly dedicated to medication safety exists in Switzerland and health care regulations differ widely between different cantons. In ambulatory care, direct drug dispensing by the prescribing physician is permitted in almost all German- speaking cantons, hampering the interprofessional collaboration between physicians and pharmacists . With regard to the aging population and multimorbidity, a proactive comprehensive national medication safety strategy is cruc ial. National studies , priority setting and subsequent solidly financed improvement projects including effectiveness studies, lead by stable institutions and involving all stakeholders , should be encouraged (e.g. the impact of interprofessional activities like quality circles on medication safety seem promising, but war rant further systematic review). A framework for interprofessional collaboration is envisioned, integrating digital solutions. And last but not least , patient and medication safety topics sh ould become an integral part in the training curriculum for medical degrees. This might also advance the development of standardi sed guidelines for medication safety improvement. Topics not addressed in this report: Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) 3 Abbreviations, Terms and D efinitions ADE Adverse Drug Event A complication resulting from the use of a drug, regardless of whether the drug was used properly or not. 7 ADR Adverse Drug Reaction Any response to a drug which is noxious and unintended which occurs at doses normally used in man for prophylaxis, diagnosis, or therapy of di sease, or for the modifi cations of physiological function7. Inherent risk of every drug product. Adverse reactions may arise from use of the product within or outside the terms of the marketing authorisation or from occupational exposure. Use outside the marketing authorisation includes off -label use, overdose, misuse, abuse and medication errors 8. CDSS Clinical Decision Support System An application that analyses data to help healthcare providers make decisions and improve patient care CIS Clinical Information System A large computerized database management system that processes patient data in order to support patient care . This system is used by health care professionals to access patient data and to plan, implement and evaluate care. CPOE Computerized (Physician or) Providers Order Entry Any system that allows registered health care providers to request drugs, laboratory studies or radiological tests by entering those request in an electronic health care record CIRS Critical Incident Reporting System Reporting system which enables hospitals and other health care institutions to record and analyse adverse incidents and near misses with a view to improve patient safety by learning from these incidents DRP Drug Related Problem An event or circumstance involving drug treatment (pharmaco - therapy) that actually or potentially interferes with desired health outcomes . 9 Figure 1: Drug -related problems (DRPs): the relationship between different terms (figure adopted from NCC MERP 7) EPRO Electronic Patient Record Systemati sed collection of a patient 's health information in a digital format.

MEs are in principle avoidable. PSAT Parenteralia Self Assessment Tool Standardized scheme of hotspots in medication process, and accurately defined interventions enabl ing the systematic risk assessment in order to reduce the risks associated with the handling of parenteral administrated drugs . 10 4 Medication process: safety, quality and efficiency 1. A comprehensive approach to reducing MEs One way of avoiding MEs is to systematically record and analyse them in an interprofessional environment . While there is no blanket legal requirement to operate a CIRS in Switzerland, many cantons require a CIRS in their care agreements11. A 2010 survey of chief pharmacists revea led that 24 of 25 hospitals had a CIRS12. Recording and analysing errors and near misses is particularly important in terms of medication safety, as experience shows that in healthcare institutions overall , reports involving drugs account for 30% to 50% of CIRS reports. Nevertheless , pharmacists at many hospitals are still not systematically involved in the interprofessional appraisal of critical incidents involving drugs. Since reports are voluntary, they are not necessarily complete or representative. But experience suggests that a CIRS is a cos t-efficient tool which facilitates prioritization of medication safety improvement initiatives13. CIRS systems are also a key instrument in raising awareness of risks and possible solutions among hospital and nursing home staff, promoting a systemic and interprofessional approach as well as a positive, open- minded culture of dealing with errors. In 2014 the GSASA 's quality and safety committee also drew up a checklist to help systematically recognise risks and potenti al improvements in the handling of parenterals, an entire group of high- risk drugs, and efficiently implement corresponding measures 10. This PSAT also recommends reporting and regularly evaluating errors and near misses (criteria 4.8 and 8.1). 2. Ward -specific standardisation of the medication process The IOM has recommended the standardi sation of rules and aids for drug prescri bing, dosage (including minimum and maximum doses) and administration times, at least on a ward- specific basis. Comparably, the PSAT recommends prescribing in writing, using only units and abbreviations officially recognised by the institution, and standardi sing at the very least minim um the minimum information required for safe drug administration (criteria 4.1 to 4.3). Added to this, at many institutions the introduction of a CIS with an electronic prescribing system has enabled the standardi sation of aids, master data and prescr ibing rules (units and abbreviations) across the institution. With regard to the introduction of the EPRO , the GSASA recommends the nation- wide standardi abbreviations, units and prescribing rules. Moreover, electronic prescribing systems generally have an option for predefining frequent prescriptions (so-called favourites), which can significantly improve the safety and efficiency of the prescribing process. 3. Computerised physician order entry (CPOE) Many acute care hospitals, and an increasing number of long- term care facilities , already have implemented a CIS with an electronic medical record and electronic prescri bing. This trend to digitalisation is boosted by the federal government 's decision in 2017 that Swiss acute care hospitals (by 2020) and nursing homes (by 2022) have to commit to transfer relevant data to the EPRO at discharge. 5 Electronic prescribing systems optimi se readability and facilitate central data storage. This in turn increases the ability of different profes sional groups to simultaneously, flexibly and promptly access the necessary patient data, prevents transfer errors, enables interfaces to be managed efficiently, and thus boosts medication safety. What remains problematic are insular IT solutions such as for the intensive care unit and anaesthesiology /operating room , where the requirements for clinical information systems differ from those on \" ordinary \" nursing wards. Using different prescribing systems increases the likelihood of transmission errors at internal interfaces. This means that the next challenge will be to link these spec ific CISs to the hospital 's overall CIS to minimise interfaces and the resulting transmission errors within the facility. This is important because data from the institution' s clinical information system also serve as the basis for transfer to the EPRO. Despite many major advantages, the i mplementation of a CIS with electronic prescribing is a very complex process that may introduce new (minor) technical risks. CPOE can't provide comprehensive medication safety. It may support the prescribing process but the therapeutic decision making for a given patient still remains the responsibility of the physicians. 4. Facilitating the prescribing process with pharmacotherapeutic progr ams and decisionmaking aids These days a number of web- based pharmacotherapeutic dosage and interaction check ing established electronic prescribing systems in Switzerland ha ve a built -in interaction checking software. More advanced CDSSs are currently at an early stage of implementation, for example for adjusting dosage to kidney or liver function (Documedis\u00ae CDS -Check Tool), dosages for children (PEDeDose\u00ae from PEDeus), and identifying high- risk medication situations (PharmaClass\u00ae). In oncology almost all Swiss hospitals have established the cato\u00ae software solution, primarily designed to support and safeguard the process of centrally preparing cytotoxic drugs in hospital pharmacies . Even so, at most hospitals the prescriptions themselves are not entered directly in cato\u00ae or the CIS , which means that the potential for safeguarding prescriptions using stored oncological therapy regimens is not exploited. A Swiss study clearly demonstrated that the integral use of cato\u00ae can significantly reduce prescription errors by approximately 60% (4.6% vs 2.0%)14. 5. Introduction of unit doses Systems for distributing (solid oral) drugs in unit doses are designed to ensure the safe, patient -specific preparation and administration of drugs. However, so far this type of system has not been established in any acute care hospital in Switzerland. Projects with this aim have foundered because of the complexity of the clinical routine, the necessity of completely reorganising the medication use process around the new system and the tasks for involved nursing and pharmacy staff and recent challenges as well. In particular, the introduction of Diagnosis Related Groups (DRG) and the shift of treatments from inpatient to outpatient care have forced hospitals to become more reactive in order to reduce the duration of patient stays. 6 For those reasons, the unit dose system remains primarily an option for long- term care facilities (nursing homes) and outpatient facilities (retail pharmacie and home healthcare) in Switzerland. There are now a number of providers for these areas: institutional hospital pharmaci es with blister pack aging equipment, and companies such as Medifilm\u00ae, Mydose\u00ae and Schweizer Blisterzentrum. In retail pharmacies, dispensers are mostly filled manually , for example with the help of Pharmis\u00ae or Pyxis\u00ae. Acute care hospitals, by contrast, are increasingly using electronic medicine cabinets (e.g. Pyxis\u00ae or Mach-4\u00ae) on the wards, which offer a great deal of flexibility at a safety level comparable to unit dose system s. At institutions with a low level of digitalisation, an alternative approach to assur e the safety of the medication use process is the transfer of ward- based medication management activities (stock management , preparation of patient -specific dispensers and parenterals, etc.) from the nursing staff to pharmacy technicians under the accountability of the hospital pharmacy . A survey of 48 hospital pharmacists in 2017 showed that 61% of hospital pharmacies are already involved in managing ward pharmacies, and that these activities are gaining popularity 15. Separate medication rooms, a needs - appropriate range, neatly arranged drug stocks , active returns management, and measures to avoid look-alike errors and guarantee adherence to the \" first expired, first out \" principle are all key strategies to ensuring the safe and economical use of dr ugs. 6. Preparing high -risk parenterals in the central pharmacy Since the mid -1990s hospital pharmacies have been realigning their approach to drug compounding and preparation. As a result, nowadays the preparation of certain high- risk parenterals ( cytotoxic drugs , total parenteral nutrition, etc.) and parenterals for high -risk patient s (e.g. neonatology ) is centralized in almost all acute care hospitals across Switzerland in the hospital pharmacy, using cleanrooms and applying Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP)16. 7. Creating specific processes and written protocols for the use of high -risk drugs The PSAT also recommends standardising the management of high- risk drugs in general and optimising the medication use process along the following lines: - Defining a list of high -risk drugs, implementing measures necessary to ensure their safe use and monitoring (criterion 1.2) - Reviewing inventory /stockkeeping (criterion 2.2) - Using standardised checklists/prescription forms (criterion 4.6) - Assuring adequate labelling of prepared drugs , up to the bedside (criterion 5.6) - Introducing guidelines on minimum and maximum doses and the corresponding safety barriers (criterion 5.11) - Providing tools for calculating infusion rates (criterion 5.12) - Independent double- checks for co mplex dosage calculations and pump programming (criterion 5.13). Despite the numerous points to be considered, most high- risk parenterals - including electrolyte concentrates for infusion - are still stored and prepared for use on the nursing wards. 7 So far, it has not been possible to implement the centralised preparation of all high -risk parenterals in hospital pharmacies in Switzerland, primarily because of a lack of personnel resources necessary for 24- hour operation. In this context , the PSAT reco mmends at least using solutions for infusion of high- risk drugs in standard ised concentrations (criterion 5.4). However, various attempts by the pharmaceutical industry to bring standardi zed electrolyte solutions for infusion to the market have failed beca use of the heterogeneity of clinical needs and/or the wishes of nursing wards. 8. Limiting the different types of infusion equipment Intravenous administration of drugs, especially high- risk drugs, is increasingly pump- controlled. The PSAT recommends limiting the number of standard pumps used to a maximum of two models per type (e.g. syringe drivers, infusion pumps, Patient Controlled Analgesia ( PCA) pumps) (criterion 1.4), formulating guidelines for their use (criterion 5.14), and regularly inspecting and maintaining all equipment for administering drugs (criterion 8.2). Even though there is insufficient data to be able to assess the degree to which this recommendation has been implemented throughout Switzerland, a 2015 survey suggest s that it has been implemented to a large extent17. 9. Clinical pharmacists accompanying care teams on their ward rounds Since the 1990s, clinical pharmacy has developed considerably in Switzerland and is now comparatively widespread in larger hospitals . Parallel to this there has been a steady increase in the availability of relevant training (CAS /DAS /MAS program s). There are major regional differences, however: a study showed that in 2013, clinical pharmacists accounted for approximately 25% of hospital pharmacist jobs in western and southern Switzerland, but only approximately 10% in German- speaking Switzerland (see Figure 2)18. These differences correlate strikingly with the drug dispensing system in the ambulatory care sector10. 8 Figure 2: Percentage of clinical pharmacy activity (red, in full -time equivalents) versus other hospital pharmacy activities (yellow); survey conducted in 2013; hospitals with several sites are combined in one column The PSAT also recommends regularly involving clinical pharmacists in monitoring pharmacotherapy and documenting their interventions in the patient record in standardised form (criteria 6.1 and 6.2.1). The GSASA has developed a classification system to record the DRPs identified and handled by clinical pharmacists19. An analysis of DRPs recorded at 11 hospitals with an average observation period of 10 months revealed more than 9,500 observed problems . Figure 3 shows how these break down by category20. Figure 3: DRP (recorded as per GSASA classification) at 11 Swiss hospitals (total time of observation: 121 months; observation period: Jan 2012 to May 2013) [diagram adapted from Gaufroid 20] 9 10. Availability of relevant patient information at the patient' s bed side As mentioned above, many acute care hospitals, and an increasing number of nursing homes, already have a CIS in place. Additional patient -specific data like allergies, lab findings, etc. can also be recorded in electronic medical record s. However, several problems remain unresolved: data on allergies are mostly subjectively provided by patients and is rarely entered in CIS in a structured form. 11. Improving patients ' knowledge of their drug therapy Unlike the UK 's National Health Service, where \" patients should be encouraged and helped to self - administer while in hospital \"21, endeavours to improve patients ' knowledge of their drugs while in hospital are still in their infancy in Switzerland. The primary goal of institutions in Switzerland at present time is to assure that staff uses drugs safely up to the point of discharge. However, a n increasing number of program s are being implemented, at least on rehabilitation and long- term care wards, to help patients practice drug management while they are in hospital and thus increase medication safety at home once they are discharged. The annual survey conducted by the Swiss National Association for Quality Development in Hospitals (ANQ), which includes adult patients in acute care hospitals, gives an indication of the quality of patient training with regard to their drug therapy (question 4: \" Were you given a clear explanation of the purpose of the medicines you were supposed to take at home?\" )22. Overall , patients were quite satisf ied with the instructions provided (4.47/5), but the heterogeneous results show that there is potential for improvement at many hospitals. One solution for further improving patients ' knowledge of their drug therapies could be retail pharmacies within hospitals. There, patients could be supplied with the necessary drugs upon discharge and be systematically instructed on their proper use23. Recent issues and strategies for improving medication safety: 12. Systematic medication reconciliation at transitions of care So far the focus has been on DRPs during hospitalisation. However, many problems arise specifically on transitions of care, resulting in a negative impact on patient outcomes 24 25. Despite this, it is only since 2013 that the issue of medication safety at transitions in care between outpatient and inpatient settings has been widely debated in Switzerland as well26. When patients are admitted to a hospital , there is often no systemat ic medication history taken or medication reconciliation done. This can lead to clinically relevant problems27 28. And when patients are discharged, up to 50% of discharge prescriptions are incorrect or unclear29. When patients are transferred to home healthcare (S pitex), more than one third of prescriptions from the hospital were unclear to home care nurses30. Professional associations also recommend the introduction of systematic medication reconciliation on hospital admission all across Switzerland31. Ideally , this duty should be performed in an interprofessional context32 33 (physicians , hospital pharmacist, nurses). However, this is currently standard practice in only one Swiss hospital ( Cantonal Hospital Zug). 10 13. Availability of requisite drugs In recent years , there has been a significant increase in supply bottlenecks and market withdrawals. The current status of shortages can be viewed at www.drugshortage.ch . This affects acute care hospitals in particul ar: according to a 2015 survey, for example, approximately 120 supply bottlenecks with a mean duration of 54 days occurred, including shortages of essential drugs such as parenteral antibiotics and vaccines. While patients feel the effects of such shortages in only approximately 10% of cases, they do lead to a lot of insecurity and uncertainty among staff and considerable extra work for hospital pharmacies ( approxim ately 1.5 hours per shortage)34. Federal measures such as the ordinance on keeping compulsory stocks of drugs and the reporting requirement for shortages of essential drugs have proven insufficient (see also https://www.bwl.admin.ch/bwl/de/home/themen/heilmittel/meldestelle.html ). Barriers and challenges Given the lack of complete data on the implementation of medication safety strategies, it is difficult to comprehensively assess the situation regarding medication safety in Switzerland. In this report we have endeavoured to track down available data and, where these data are missing, to make an expert appraisal. On this basis we can draw t he following conclusions: - Individual IOM recommendations have already been implemented on a widespread basis ( comprehensive approach/CIRS, centralised preparation of cyto toxic drugs ) - In recent years , significant progress has been made on other recommendations thanks to the introduction of quality - and safety -relevant measures (electronic prescribing systems, in some cases with pharmacotherapeutic decisionmaking tools ; standardised medication processes ; clinical pharmacy services ; pharmaceutical ward management) - With some recommendations, however, there is evidence of only modest progress or activity (centralised storage/stocktaking and preparation of high- risk parenterals ; introduction of unit dose or equivalent systems; improvements in patients ' drug knowledge; systematic medication reconciliation) - And for some issues, the situation has even taken a step backwards ( drug shortages ). We also observe that the degree to which recommendations are implemented depends to a significant extent on how incentives are framed. A few examples: - CIRSs are sometimes required in cantonal care agreements. - The centralised preparation of cytotoxic drugs can be remunerated, at least in part, by way of a correspondi ng tariff. There are also SUVA guidelines on how these substances should be handled 35. - The federal government 's eHealth requirements are facilitating the introduction of electronic CIS . However, the introduction of such systems is made harder by the fact that Switzerland has three languages and therefore offers only micromarkets for providers of IT solutions. This gives the remaining providers more market clout and forces hospitals and homes to adopt standard IT solutions, in most cases from neighbouring c ountries where the same language is spoken, or develop their own solutions at (too) great expense. This leads to a highly heterogeneous range of electronic medical record and prescribing systems and to the necessity of intensive preliminary training. 11 - Belief in the cost -efficiency of a competition- driven healthcare system, plus a federal system comprising 26 autonomous healthcare systems and more than 70 different health insurers, is leading to a situation where every stakeholder minimises their costs t o the detriment of common, long- term goals. This means that measures that will allegedly cost an individual stakeholder too much are not implemented. Ironically, a recent countermeasure from parliament (the risk equalisation scheme) has led to the disconti nuation of the high- quality, cost -efficient Freiburg model for the pharmaceutical management of nursing homes36. In many other areas we see voluntary local initiatives on a personal basis, but in most case these activities remain fragmented and fail to cross disciplines or be structurally anchored. GSASA Recommendations The following measures would significantly improve medication safety: 1. A comprehensive national medication safety strategy is requested with binding regulatory requirements . For health care institutions this should include at least such matters as: - Quality assurance systems for hospitals in general and hospital pharmacies in particular covering the entire medication use process - Systematic medication reconciliation at all t ransitions of care to ensure regular up- dating of a patient's drug list as the basis for any following step in the medication use process. - Interprofessional structures (medication safety committees / medication safety officers in acute care hospitals and nursing homes) and all sorts of activities to improve medication safety - analogous to those for infection prevention - with the authority to issue institutionally binding guidelines - CIRS with interprofessional appraisal, including hospital pharmacists, of critical incidents involving drugs 2. A national body for medication safety involving all relevant stakeholders and institutions should be entrusted to coordinate activities and research in order to improve medication safety. This would enable the collection of missing data on the scale of the problem on a comprehensive basis and the evaluation of the efficacy, appropriateness and cost -efficiency of improvement measures. 3. Comprehensive digitalization of the medication use process. This includes CIS , CPOE, CDSS, electronic medicine cabinets on the wards of acute care hospitals resp. unit dose systems for nursing homes, and eHealth/EPRO. 4. Adequate stock keeping of drugs at all stages, enforced by federal measures and supported by an adequate pricing policy 5. General implementation of technical measures, e.g.: - Implementation of s eparate medication rooms on the wards - Standardization of abbreviations, units and prescribing rules across Switzerland - Opening of retail pharmacies within/close to hospitals to systematically instruct patients upon discharge on the proper use of their medication 12 6. Using the specific knowhow of hospital pharmacy staff, e.g.: - Ward- based medication management by pharmacy technicians - Involving clinical pharmacists in pharmacotherapy - Implementing specific processes for the use of high- risk drugs, including standardized concentrations for infusion solutions or preparing high- risk parenterals in the central pharmacy 7. All-encompassing incentive systems across institutional and cantonal boundaries e.g. for improving the quality of discharge prescriptions or instructions given to patients prior to discharge 13 References 1 GSASA/SBK/VLSS.

Swiss National Report on Quality and Safety in Healthcare Contribution made by Swissmedic on: Pha rmacovigilance - how does it contribute?\" 2 Abstract Pharmacovigilance is an important instrument to collect information on the safety profile of a medicinal product after its initial marketing authorisation. Spontaneous reports on unexpected adverse drug reactions provide valuable evidence to detect new saf ety signals. Reports are mainly submitted by healthcare professionals and pharmaceutical companies (marketing authorisation holders). Underreporting (by healthcare professionals) is an issue, although legislation mandates reporting. Suitable IT tools are being introduced in order to facilitate the reporting and make signal detection more efficient. Application of internally harmonised standards such as a common terminology is important in order to ensure comparability of events and enable analysis of data globally. International cooperation and the use of global databases broaden the basis for the detection of new signals. Cooperation with healthcare professional and patient organisations provides useful input for regulatory actions and communication. More and more information - mainly directed to healthcare professionals - is made public, such as public summaries of Risk -Management Plans or Healthcare Professional Communications, which is also integrated into the medicinal product information platform. Challenges to be addressed include the need to enhance patient reporting of ADRs, how to make use of \"big data\" in pharmacovigilance, and the ever increasing expectations for (preliminary) data to be made public. In order to address these challenges, new tool s need to be implemented for patient reporting, cooperation with healthcare professionals, patients and international partner authorities need to be further enhanced and risk communication needs to be revised.

What is known about the safety, quality and efficiency of care in Switzerland in the area of pharmacovigilance? When applying for a marketing authorisation of a new medicinal product, the applicant has to submit documentation to prove the medicinal product's efficacy, quality and safety. The potential benefits are assessed as well as potential harm to patients. The established benefit - risk profile is the basis for the decision to approve a product for use. As of today, it is based on data from clinical trials, conducted in a controlled environment with a limited number of patients - compared to its use in clinical and medical practice. It is evident that it is not possible to identify all risks, e.g. in certain patient groups or rare risks, during clinical trials. This is why spontaneous reports on unexpected adverse drug reactions (ADR or Individual Case Safety Reports, ICSR) after the authorisation of a medicinal product provide valuable evidence to detect new safety signal s. The recording of individual ADR reports and observational studies in the context of a widespread or long -term use play s an important role in the continued verification of the benefit -risk profile over time . A newly detected risk or even a change in the frequency or severity of a known risk may have an impact on this profile, requiring for example a change in the medicinal product information or other risk mitigation measures. The current system of collecting ADR is strongly based on reporting by healthcare professionals and companies (marketing authorisation holders). Repor ting of ADRs by patients is possible, but numbers are still marginal. Companies report directly to Swissmedic, the national pharmacovigilance centre, whereas healthcare professionals reports are collected and validated by six regional pharmacovigilance centres (RPVCs) . ADR reports collected in Switzerland are stored in a database at Swissmedic and assessed in order to identify potential safety signals. The reports are also shared with the WHO Programme for International Drug Monitoring, the Uppsala Monit oring Centre (UMC)1,2. Fig.1: The Swiss ADR reporting system for human medicinal products Switzerland has one of the highest rates of reporting of ADRs in the world, but there is still serious underreporting3. Swiss National Report on Quality and Safety in Healthcare Contribution made by Swissmedic on: Pha rmacovigilance - how does it contribute?\" 5 According to Assoc. Prof. Stefan Weiler from the Department of Clinical Pharmacology & Toxicology at the University Hospital Zurich, t he reasons for healthcare professionals not reporting ADRs includ e: Erroneous assumptions that only safe medicines are on the market and that an ADR is therefor e not possible. Fear of becoming entangled in a legal dispute or of losing the patient's trust. Subjective feelings of guilt that a medicine may have harmed more than helped. Personal ambition to collect and publish case reports (publish or perish). Unwillingness to report a drug- induced reaction solely on the basis of a suspicion without a definite connection, or simply the lack of time and interest: \"The bureaucracy and completion of forms won't help improve my patient's situation.\" Primary reporters are also not reimbursed for their time and intellectual input4. Nevertheless, t he number of reports received has increased from 2015 to 2017, as shown in the table below. Number of ADRs Type of medicinal product 2015 2016 2017 Human medicines 8247 10047 9637 Veterinary medicines 292 Blood products 2702 3124 3076 Table 1: Number of ADRs received per year (2015- 2017)5 2. What are the significant and relevant quality and safety improvement interventions that have taken place in Swiss Healthcare in the area of PV? 2.1 Digitalisation Over the last years, serious investments have been made by Swissmedic to modernise its IT infrastructure. This included basic functionalities such as document management, databases, planning and tracking tools for applications and a web portal offering an increasing number of e-government services6. With regard to the reporting of ADRs, two online reporting systems are available today: The B2B gateway The Electronic Vigilance System (ElViS) The B2B gateway is a system interface that can be used to electronically send and receive suspected adverse drug reaction reports (individual case safety reports, ICSR) in E2Bi format. This service is designed to appeal particularly to marketing authorisation holders who send a large number of reports. ElViS also provides a simple, secure and rapid way to exchange ADR reports and documents with the RPVC s. ElViS is designed for health care professionals (HCP) and marketing authorisation holders who do not use the existing B2B gateway to send ADR reports to Swissmedic. ElViS offers the choice of entering ADR online or uploading an E2B -compatible file. In addition to the online reporting tools, Swissmedic has also replaced its central IT system for the management of ADRs. The new system allowed to increase efficiency by reduc ing the i E2B refers to the ICH standard on Clinical Safety Data Management : Data Elements for Transmission of Individual Case Safety Reports (see also page 6). Swiss National Report on Quality and Safety in Healthcare Contribution made by Swissmedic on: Pha rmacovigilance - how does it contribute?\" 6 administrative burden and managing the ADRs in a paperless process. It also provides for a comprehensive data warehouse for the evaluation of all Swiss reports as well as standardised signal detection processes. The system currently uses the ICH standard E2B version R2, but can also receive and process reports in the latest version (E2B( R3)) of the standard. Fig. 2: IT systems used in the context of ADR reporting and evaluation (simplified) 2.2 International harmonisation ADRs are coded using a common terminology in order to enable comparison and signal detection in databases around the globe. In the past decades, t he WHO Adverse Reaction Terminology (WHO -ART) , which was developed and maintained by UMC was the terminology for coding adverse drug reactions in the WHO database ( \"VigiBase \")7. In the late 1990s, the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for H uman Use (ICH) developed the Medical Dictionar y for Regulatory Activities ( MedDRA ), a standardised medical terminology to facilitate sharing of regulatory information internationally for medical products used by humans , which over the years became a global standard8. In September 2013, Swissmedic dec ided to switch from WHO -ART to MedDR A. Within the following four months, all Swiss cases were analysed, mapped and re- coded in close co - operation with the Uppsala Monitoring Centre (UMC). On 1 February 2014, all cases in the Swissmedic database were coded in MedDRA and Swissmedic staff started using the new terminology. In a publication, the benefits of the switch are summarized as follows9: Swiss National Report on Quality and Safety in Healthcare Contribution made by Swissmedic on: Pha rmacovigilance - how does it contribute?\" 7 The use of an international standard greatly facilitates the exchange of data between Swissmedic and Marketing Authorisation Holders that were already using MedDRA terminology for some time. The cumbersome re- coding from WHO -ART to MedDRA and vice versa has become superfluous for both sides. Furthermore, the use of MedDRA provides for an easier proc essing of follow -up reports . Additionally, on an international level, sharing of information and comparison of data is facilitated when using the same internationally accepted standard. 2.3 Increased international cooperation Over the last decade, regulat ory authorities, including Swissmedic, have built networks for increased international cooperation. On the one side, authorities have signed numerous bilateral agreements on exchange of information and other cooperative activities , and on the other side multilateral initiatives have emerged or developed10. For Swissmedic, in the area of pharmacovigilance, there has been a notable improvement in the cooperation with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) following the signing in July 2015 of an administrative agreement between the EU Commission and the EMA on the one side and the federal Department of Home Affairs and Swissmedic on the other side11. Exchange of relevant safety information, early warnings regarding new risk communication and access to the outcomes of discussions of the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC )12 and Committee for Human Medicinal Products ( CHMP ) are useful measures to improve Swissmedic' ability to act and react in a timely and appropriate way and if possible to align with EMA PRAC procedures and recommendations . The network of bilateral agreements for the exchange of information also forms the basis for the participation of Swissmedic in regular multilateral telephone conferences with partne r authorities - such as the EMA, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Device Agency (PMDA) - on pharmacovigilance issues. Active participation in t he International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH)13 is one of the key priorities of the international cooperation at Swissmedic. Development and implementation of global standards provides the basis for equivalent regulatory systems and harmonised requireme nts for the regulated industry . Swissmedic applies ICH standards as a basic principle, considering them as \"current state of science and technology\". The most relevant ICH standards in the area of pharmacovigilance are listed in Annex 1 : 2.4 Enhanced cooperation with healthcare professionals' associations and patient /consumer organisations In the context of the implementation of a structured engagement with all relevant stakeholders, Swissmedic has developed an approach for enhanced cooperation with health care professional associations in 2016. Looking at the diversity of this stakeholder group, the approach foresees the possibility for ad hoc projects or exchange, combined with annual meetings to discuss topics of common interest. An example for such cooperation that even pre-dates the implementation of the structured approach, is the development of materials for gynaecologists and women with the aim to promote an informed discussion of the benefits and harms of hormonal contraceptives during the consultation visit. This material has been developed in 2013 by the Swiss gynaecologists' association in cooperation with Swissmedic14. In May 2014, Swissmedic has established a w orking group with patient and consumer organisations as a platform for the exchang e of information15. Pharmacovigilance and the reporting of ADRs has been one of the areas of interest that had been identified early on and Swiss National Report on Quality and Safety in Healthcare Contribution made by Swissmedic on: Pha rmacovigilance - how does it contribute?\" 8 has been discussed repeatedly at meetings of the working group. In addition to the well - established information exchange, a pilot project has been initiated to involve patient representatives in the preparation of the medicinal product information in the course of the process to obtain a marketing authorisation. Such a process has been in place in the European Union for a number of years, and has proven to improve readability of patient information, including information on possible side- effects of a medicine. 2.5 Increased transparency and communication The Risk Management Plan (RMP) for a medicinal product contains the risk aspects of the product, the planned pharmacovigilance activities and risk minimisation measures. The evaluation of the documentation is an integral part of the marketing authorisation decision. The purpose of the RMP is to describe known and suspected potential risk aspects at the time of marketing authorisation, and to establish strategies on how these can be characterised in future and countered in a risk minimisation approach. Swissmedic has published RMP summaries of authorised medicinal products since May 201516. Based on the publicly accessible RMP summaries, healthcare professionals and other interested stakeholders can obtain information about the specific measures that have been arranged for the future characterisation and minimisation of risks for the corresponding medicinal product. The RMP summaries supplement the publicly accessible information for healthcare professionals and patients and are linked to the corresponding medicinal product information via the Swissmedic information platform17. In the same way, recent safety updates are made available, such as (Direct) Healthcare Professional Communications ((D)HPC). Fig. 3: Extract of Swissmedic medicinal product information platform indicating a recent safety communication (DHC) for Valproat e-containing medicinal products. 3. What are the barriers and challenges encountered in the area of PV? 3.1 Patient reporting of ADRs Compared to other countries, pat ient reporting of ADRs is still marginal in Switzerland. This may be due to a lack of knowledge about the fact that patients can report such events to Swissmedic or the RPVCs, but also the lack of suitable reporting tools may contribute to the small numbers. It must also be stated that Swissmedic is currently not actively encouragi ng reporting of ADRs by patients, one of the reasons being the (perceived) lack of quality of such reports . 3.2 Use of \"big data \" in pharmacovigilance and post -market surveillance According to a policy paper published by the International Coalition of Medicines Regulatory Authorities (ICMRA) , big data refers to \" a collection of structured and unstructured data that may be enormous, in the range of several billion gigabytes. In post -market surveillance, structured data may include SRSs, electronic health records (EHRs), electronic medical Swiss National Report on Quality and Safety in Healthcare Contribution made by Swissmedic on: Pha rmacovigilance - how does it contribute?\" 9 records (EMRs), administrative health data (AHD), registries, etc. Unstructured data may include social media like Twitter, Facebook, patient forums, clinical narratives within EMRs, etc.\"18 In the EU a joint Heads of Medicines Agencies (HMA) and EMA Task Force (HMA/EMA Task Force on Big Data)19 has been mandated to explore a number of issues regarding the emerging challenges presented by big data by: Mapping relevant sources of big data and defining the main format in which they are expected to exist Identifying the usability or application of big data Describing the current state, future state and challenges with regard to; o regulatory expertise and competences o the need to specify legislation and guidelines o data analysi ng tools and systems needed to handle big data o regulators' responsibility for raw data analytics vs sponsor's responsibility Designing a big data roadmap Generating a list of recommendations as well as evaluating the usefulness of big data in the regulator y setting Collaborating with FDA, Health Canada and other third party country stakeholders, including ICMRA, to ensure bilateral insights on big data initiatives For Swissmedic, it will be essential to follow the progress made and if possible to actively participate in international initiatives on this highly challenging but relevant topic. 3.3 Early information and public databases As indicated earlier, Swissmedic has taken measures to increase transparency and provide information to the public over the last years. In addition, the revised Act on Therapeutic Products includes provisions for increased transparency such as the possibil ity to publish information on negative outcomes of marketing authorisation procedures or pending applications. Still, compared to the amount and types of data made public by other regulatory authorities, Swissmedic is lagging behind. Communication of newly emerging risks - even before causality with the use of a medicinal product is confirmed is one of the approaches, the US Food and Drug Administration is applying in its Sentinel initiative. Other regulatory authorities, such as the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) are making their ADR database accessible for patients and healthcare professionals. In Switzerland, such measures are not discussed yet . Still, the positive effects of such transparency measures needs to be shown. It would requir e a careful analysis of potential upsides and downsides - based on experience gathered abroad - before implementation of such approaches . 4. What are the recommendations for improvement in the area of PV? 4.1 Further e nhance cooperation with healthcare professionals and patients The cooperation with healthcare professionals has been especially useful in the area of pharmacovigilance. Swissmedic is planning to further enhance this cooperation including the possibility to work with Healthcare professional associations as well as patient and consumer organisations to improve the medicinal product information and risk communication as well as assisting with the dissemination of information. In addition, medical faculties at Swiss universities should be sensit ized for the need to strengthen the relevance of pharmacovigilance in the training curriculum of medicine students. Swiss National Report on Quality and Safety in Healthcare Contribution made by Swissmedic on: Pha rmacovigilance - how does it contribute?\" 10 4.2 Improved/modernized risk communication Appropriate, targeted and timely risk communication is a key element for ensuring patient safety. In addition to the existing tools such as HPCs, the use of social media and the involvement of patient advocacy groups should be explored to provide such information. Explaining the concept of benefit -risk assessment - at time of marketing authorisati on and over the whole life -cycle of a medicinal product is another challenge that should be addressed by adequate tools for benefit -risk communication. 4.3 Facilitation of adverse event reporting Swissmedic has implemented online reporting tools mainly addressed to healthcare professionals and marketing authorisation holders. Patient reporting could be encouraged by providing easy -to-use tools such as an App for reporting of ADRs. In the times of big data, concerns over the quality of patients' reports o f ADRs must be put into perspective and approaches for the use of such data must be developed, in line with the outcomes of international initiatives, e.g. from CIOMS . 4.4 Continued/enhanced international cooperation With a population of more than eight million inhabitants and the already mentioned underreporting of ADRs, it is obvious that a Swiss pharmacovigilance system cannot work in isolation. Safety signals are often detected in larger populations such as the EU or the US. Information needs to be s hared and measures need to be coordinated. In this regard, continued or even enhanced cooperation with the EMA is crucial. International cooperation is also required to jointly work on common challenges such as development of regulatory approaches and shar ing of best practices with regard to the use big data or real -world data (RWD) in regulatory decision- making .

IPC staffing and activity in Swiss hospitals and long - term facilities is diverse according to a recent survey, while a minimal standard is now in development. Historically IPC led the way to standardization in healthcare, a stringent epidemiological approach, monitoring and feedback of relevant results of structure, process and outcome qualities, multi -modal promotion of good clinical practice using behavioral and social sciences, and more recently, human factors engineering. The origins of IPC in Switzerland goes back to the 1960s and is now supported by the Federal Office of Public Health with the two prominent national schemes Strategy NOSO and Strategy against Antimicrobial Resistance (StAR). Various stakeholders are involved, most prominently the Swiss Center for Infection Prevention Swissnoso, the Swiss Society for Infection Prevention (SGSH/SSHH), and the two IPC nursing associations. Several outbreaks have been controlled and preparedness organized with the help of IPC experts on national, regional, and institutional levels HAI surveillance schemes have been established and sustained over years, now a comprehensive HAI surveillance system is being installed. The future of IPC will certainly see an even profounder use of implementation science and digital health, and IPC will continue to play a leading role in the continuous strive for the best health o utcomes and resource across all parts of the Swiss healthcare system. 3 The origins of infection prevention and control in Switzerland Infection prevention and control (IPC) as formal institutions has its historic roots back in the 1960s that resulted in th e foundation of the Swiss Society for Infection Control (Schweiz. Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Spitalhygiene - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 suisse de l'hygi\u00e8ne hospitali\u00e8re) in 1974, which still exists today. It is an interprofessional society including pharmacists, laboratory specialists, nurses and physicians dedicated to hospital hygiene and infection control. Two societies for IPC practitioners with a nursing background were founded in the two larger langu age regions in Switzerland, in 1982 the Sp\u00e9cialistes infirmiers en pr\u00e9vention de 1994 a physicians from university hospitals, Didier Pittet, Patrice Francioli, and Andreas Widmer, founded Swissnoso upon a re quest by the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) to provide national guidance and leadership in the field of IPC. A consistent backdrop to this evolution is the fragmented healthcare system reality in Switzerland, consisting in 26 autonomous healt hcare systems under the authority of the cantonal governments. Despite this fragmentation of public health decision making, FOPH has always played a central governance role in this evolution. It was in these early years that IPC led the way into patient sa fety and quality improvement as we know it today and remained at the forefront of its evolution ever since. Evolution infection and prevention dimensions over the years Ever since, IPC has considerably evolved in parallel to international progress in resea rch, implementation and outreach. Several building blocks of infection prevention have been set and improved such as infection surveillance, education of IPC personnel and healthcare providers in 4 general. Moreover, guidelines have been introduced and impro ved in parallel with the idea of evidence -based medicine. Surveillance In Switzerland, the concept of patient -oriented surveillance of NI was introduced in the 1980s.1 In 1995, the members of Swissnoso decided to perform a prevalence study of healthca re- associated infections (HAIs) , in which 4 of the 5 university hospitals participated.2,3 Four more such studies followed in 1999, 2002, 2003, and 2004, using the same period -prevalence study method.4 Insights from these studies included the impact of case -mix r ather than quality of care on the higher HAI rate of large hospitals,5,6 the fact that surgical site infections in operated patients represent an addition to the same prevalence of NI as in the non -operated population,7 and the fact that only half of all nosocomial urinary tract infections are associated with urinary catheter use.8 In 2017, Swissnoso re -installed trans -sectional surveillance of all HAI in alignment with the European definitions and method as one -day point -prevalence studies (results see below). In 2009, Swissnoso started the national surveillance of surgical site infections (SSIs) based on a scheme that was developed and implemented since 1998 in Romandie and Ticino.9,10,11 This surveillance is financed by ANQ ( www.anq.ch ) and the results of each participating hospital are made available publicly on their website each year. This represents the first and only open public reporti ng of HAI rates in Switzerland on a national scale. However, its public impact may be limited; most patients and physicians are not aware of this public reporting of SSI rates stratified by type of surgery, patients' risks and healthcare institution. Compr ehensive reports are also published on the Swissnoso website . (https://www.swissnoso.ch/module/ssi - surveillance/resultate/) and in scientific journals.12,13 A unique feature of this surveillance scheme is the structured assessment of the quality of the surveillance structures and activities in each hospital, which is then published as a score alongside with the results.14 At the conjunction between IPC and infectious diseases stands the Anresis (Swiss Centre for antibiotic resistance; http://www.anresis.ch/ ) platform that has been evolving and expanding its service over the >10 years. Through an internet site everyone can easily get access to resistance profiles (and soon also aggregate -level antibiotic consumption data) stratified by individual pathogens, age groups and Swiss geographical regions. 5 Guidelines Swissnoso was originally created to provide guidelines for infection prevention beyond disinfection procedures, publishes as simple Bulletin ( https://www.swissnoso.ch/bu lletin/ ) in the three national languages that was added to the main publication of the FOPH and attained a large readership even beyond the national borders. The main content were guidelines that were adapted from international guidelines to Swiss context and still represents the main instrument of expert guidance that has even been the reference for regulation and political discourse. Topics range from instrument reprocessing, environmental cleaning, operating room ventilation, to prevention of specific HA I. In addition, the Swiss Society for Infection Prevention (www.sgsh.ch ) created guidelines on endoscope reprocessing and participated in creating several good practice norms. Outbreaks and pandemic threats Beside the steady progress in prevention of endemic healthcare -associated infections, national and international epidemic threats have marked the history of IPC in Switzerland. The first methicillin -resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) epidemic in Switzerland was described in 1968 in Zurich.15 Only 30 years later, MRSA became endemic with a steep rise in the rate of MRSA colonisations and infections especially in the French part of Switzerland, which absorbed a significant amount of resources and became the number one IPC target for years. The variant Creutzfeldt -Jakob epidemic in the UK starting in 1996 with its peak in 2000 triggere d a national prevention initiative in Switzerland. Swissnoso was asked to examine the evidence and help to formulate a law on reprocessing multiple -use items. In 2009, the H1N1 influenza pandemic dominated the activity with IPC teams and Swissnoso and iss ued national pandemic guidelines. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) emerged 2003 as a deadly pandemic with an origin in China and a secondary main focus in Toronto, Canada, that vividly demonstrated the potential of transfer of an infection in a si ngle patient over large distances by air travel. Swiss prevention guidelines were published by Swissnoso in 2005, when 20'000 visitors from the epidemic area were attending the world watch and jewellery exhibition in Switzerland 6 (https://www.swissnoso.ch/f ileadmin/swissnoso/Dokumente/6_Publikationen/Bulletin_Artikel_D/ v12_2_2005 -06_Swissnoso_Bulletin_de.pdf). In 2014, the so far largest Ebola outbreak in West Africa challenged the fractionated Swiss healthcare system to organize high -security treatment uni ts and transports of a potentially infected patient between hospitals. Today two centres are still prepared to treat patients with highly dangerous pathogens, but a national scheme to finance these preparedness is still pending. The avian influenza H5N1 Human infections were first reported in 1997 in Hong Kong. Since 2003, more than 800 human cases of Asian HPAI H5N1 have been reported from 16 countries in Asia, Africa, the Pacific, Europe, and the Middle East, though over 60 countries have been affected. S witzerland never saw an infected patient, but the virus was isolated from birds on several occasions. In 2010, two cardiac surgery patients with foreign material implants were detected with the often fatal Mycobacterium chimaera infections in the Universit y Hospital Zurich.16,17-25 The investigations revealed in 2013 the source and t ransmission pathway by aero solisation from contaminated heater -cooler units, a stand -alone device containing a water tank and circulation system used to cool the cardioplegia solution and blood in the extracorporeal circuit. The cooling fans propelled the contaminated air onto the s urgical field. In an investigation that FOPH mandated to Swissnoso, half of the 18 concerned centres were found to operate contaminated heater -cooler units. In an astonishingly slow succession, many studies involving modern next - generation sequencing metho ds found that contamination happened at the heater -cooler factories as well as in hospitals from water sources. This outbreak demonstrated a European wide lack of accountability of medical devices companies. Burkholderia stabilis associated with contaminat ed commercially -available washing gloves, Switzerland, May 2015 to August 2016.26 Next generation sequencing showed a unique strain found in patients and new wipe packages - and at the production site of the factory. Overall, 46 patients were colonized or infected by these wipes, one patient died. This outbreak made clear that the resistance reporting system Anresis should also be used as an early warning system for potential outbreaks.27 An epidemiologically successful strain of vancomycin -resistant Enterococcus faecium VanB occurred in 2017 in the University Hospital of Bern and then spread to regional hospitals in the 7 canton and to others hospitals in Switzerland.28,29 A national taskforce has been created to issue guidance for hospitals, and as of February 2019, the epidemic is not yet stopped. Gaps in screening policies and heter ogeneous cluster management were identified as potential cause.29 Promotion The promotion of good IPC practice has always been a pivotal cornerstone of IPC and certainly been present in individual hosp itals even before any national initiatives. On a national level the first large promotional campaign was organized by Swissnoso in 2005/2006 to improve the adequate use of hand hygiene in healthcare . The idea was based on the successful multi -modal promot ion strategy in the University Hospitals of Geneva30 and further developed in parallel the WHO Guide for Hand Hygiene in Healthcare was produced in conjunction with the First Global Challenge for Patie nt Safety based on five avenues of action, systems design, leadership, monitoring and feedback, education, promotion (https://www.who.int/infection -prevention/publications/hand -hygiene -2009/ en/). With this activity organis ational and individual psychology was taken up by IPC as a tool to achieve the use of best practice in healthcare.31 Human factors and usability design was applied as a powerful tool to hand hygiene promotion.32 The Swiss Hand Hygiene Campaign was the largest effort to improve patient safety in Switzerland with over 100 participating hospitals and hand hygiene adherence measured before and after implementation efforts from 53% to 68 %. In the wake of this campaign, Swissnoso introduced a mobile solution to monitor hand hygiene adherence by direct observation, CleanHands that was developed and introduced in the Canton St. Gallen and meets a great success with over 170'000 hand hygiene opportunities from 95 institutions with an overall hand hygiene adherence of 75 entered since its launch (https://www.sw issnoso.ch/fileadmin/swissnoso/Dokumente/6_Publikationen/Bulletin_Artikel_D/ 181112_Fulchini_DE_TR.pdf ). In 2015 Swissnoso together with Patientensicherheit Schweiz launched a pilot program to measure and reduce urinary catheter utilization and both cathete r-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI) and non -infectious complications of catheters and accompanied this endeavour with healthcare worker surveys on knowledge and practice surrounding catheters.33 The seven pilot hospitals saw a significant reduction in catheter utilization, more correct indications, more frequent re-evaluation of the need for catheterization, and fewer non -infectious 8 complications; however, CAUTI were on an already low level and did not drop further. The national roll -out of this surveillance and the intervention bundle is a reasonable next step. In 2015, a pilot study started to not only survey surgical site infections, but provide Swiss hospitals with a proactive surgical site infection prevention implementation module . It contains key elements of the WHO guidelines 2016 with 10 pilot hospitals. The majority of participating hospitals succeeded to decrease the rate of surgical site infections. Finally, the IPC community is in creasingly embracing the power of social media and edutainment ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOhwNxgCyZI ; https://www.youtube.co m/watch?v=wLNJCA7V -B). Education and knowledge exchange A formal educational track for nurses to become IPC practitioners has existed in the French and German speaking parts of the country for years, but was established as a certifying national program onl y in 2010 ( https://www.epsante.ch/berufe/hfp An important on opportunity existed in the one -week CDC/SHEA courses with different proficiency levels each year in another location in Switzerland. This opportunity has ended. After several failed attempts to create an IPC curriculum and certification for medical doct ors over the past 15 years, a formal subtitle (Schwerpunkt) was accepted by the FMH in 2018. The process to establish corresponding educational pathways and structures is still ongoing. Outside of certifying education an exchange of knowledge is provided t hrough meetings organized by national surveillance and promotional schemes and conferences such as the joint annual meeting of the Swiss Society of Infectious Diseases and the Swiss Society of Infection Prevention, the so -called Club de Pathologie, the Jou rn\u00e9e romande d'Hygi\u00e8ne Hospitali\u00e8re and regional meetings regularly organized by University Hospitals. Since 2011, Switzerland is also the organizing country of the large International Conference on Prevention and Infection Control (ICPIC) , taking place e very other year and attracting more than 1000 participants from 9 >100 countries. In 2020, Switzerland will organize the Ministerial Summit on Patient Safety with Health Ministers from 40 countries, focusing on patient safety and HAI. Policy On a national level, two laws drove the evolution of IPC in Switzerland, the 1996 revised law on insurances and the 2016 revised law on epidemics that both have their stakeholders in the FOPH. The new law on epidemics laid the foundation for the first nati onal IPC strategy (see below), while the law on insurance led to activities in the field of patient safety outside of IPC. Several policies regarding IPC requirements for hospitals regarding structure and participation in quality improvement or surveilla nce activities have emerged on a cantonal level. Financial incentives and requirements regarding IPC topics have also been integrated in contracts between hospitals and insurance companies. The introduction of per -case reimbursement based on diagnostic -related groups (DRG) and the ownership status of public and private hospitals have led to a commercialisation of Swiss healthcare providers. This has attracted more attention to complications such as HAI that potentially diminish the revenues of hospitals. A dditionally, hospitals see themselves increasingly in a competing, market -driven healthcare landscape and consider quality aspects such as IPC efforts and low HAI rates as advertising assets. This increases the status of IPC on the priority list with hospi tal leadership. Breakthrough national infection and prevention programs The fight against HCI is not yet won, the preventable proportion of HAI remains between 30 - 70% according to a recent review.34 Two recent assessments paint the picture of the burden of HAI and the state of affairs regarding IPC in Switzerland. A survey on IPC staffing and the implementation was conducted in which 137 Swiss hospitals (46% of all H+ members) and 125 long -term faciliti es (37% of all Curaviva members) participated. The results showed a heterogeneous picture of Surveillance, prevention and control of HAI 10 (https://www.bag.admin.ch/dam/bag/de/dokumente/mt/noso/nosoumsetzung/strategie -noso -ist- analyse.pdf.download.pdf/strategie -noso -ist-analyse.pdf ) (see Tables 1 and 2 ; reproduced with permission of the authors). Thi s review of IPC in Switzerland also lists the innumerable actors and their respective roles that are involved on national, cantonal, and institutional levels. In 2017, Swissnoso re -installed trans -sectional surveillance of all HAI in alignment with the European definitions and method as one -day point -prevalence studies with 96 hospital participating ( https://www.swissnoso.ch/forschung -entwicklung/punktpr aevalenz - erhebung/resultate/ ). The overall prevalence of patients suffering from at least one HAI in Swiss hospitals was 5.9% (against 6% in the last European survey). When standardized according to hospital size, prevalence was 5.4%. Surgical site infecti ons accounted for 29%, lower respiratory tract infection for 18%, urinary tract infections for 15%, and primary bloodstream infections for 13% of all infections. As additional values the survey also assessed invasive devices and antibiotic use, and other d ata associated with infectious risks such as general and IPC staffing and consumption of alcohol -based handrub. Figure 1 -3 display the main results of this surveillance scheme. Two current initiatives by FOPH tackle the inter -connected fields of prevention of HAI and antibiotic resistance on a national level. These two programs leverage and funnel the existing expertise and historically evolved activity by the many stakeholders among which Swissnoso and the Swiss Society of Infection Prevention play a major role. Importantly, they also provide the necessary finances and make achieving goals realistic. The NOSO driven, and financed by FOPH based on the national law in epidemics (article 5 paragraph 1b EpG). It is based on 4 action areas with defined goals: governance, monitoring, prevention and control, and education and research. HAI surveillance is being extended, integrating the existing surveillance modules by Swissnoso. The strategy includes long -term care and outpatient settings . Some cantons (e.g. Valais and Vaud) have already developed programs f or IPC in nursing homes and public ambulatory services consisting in the education of healthcare workers, periodic workshops or audits by IPC nurses, and specific guidelines, e.g. for multi -resistant microorganisms. Recently, some cantons from Western Swit zerland developed a practical guide for prevention and treatment of infections in nursing homes (https://guide.hpci.ch/) in French and German. 11 The Strategy against Antibiotic Resistance (StAR; https://www.star.admin.ch/star/en/home.html ) takes a One Health approach that seems unique in an international comparison, integrating the veterinary and agriculture domains. Many stakeholders are involved, including the Swiss IPC societies, the Swiss Society Infectious Diseases, and Swissnoso. Outlook and discussion The evolution of IPC in Switzerland depicts the evolution of a major movement in healthcare and led the way for patient safety and quality management beyond the infectious risk. It could labelled as IPC 1.0 focussing on reprocessing and disinfection, IPC 2 .0 adopting evidence based medicine and epidemiology, and IPC 3.0 integrating the social sciences and human factors engineering. Infection prevention and control 4.0 In the next 5 -10 years it will be crucial to consolidate the heterogeneous range of progra ms and initiatives to work synergistically and efficiently towards a goal of eliminating preventable HAI in the Swiss healthcare system. It will be a challenge to strike the right balance between regulation and intrinsic motivation by individual hospital l eadership and their IPC teams, between standardization on a national level and the necessary liberty to identify local problems and to orient limited resources to achieve maximum benefit on the hospital levels. A national surveillance system of epidemiolo gically important pathogens (e.g. based on the Anresis program) should serve as an early outbreaks warning system. This surveillance platform should be open enough to integrate new ways to identify epidemiologically successful or virulent pathogens on the strain level, e.g. using next -generation sequencing. Despite years of promotion, individual human behaviour in the face of the invisible threat of microorganisms and complex multiple casualties still represents a huge challenge. The integration of human f actors design of infrastructures and processes offers low hanging fruit that have yet to be picked. The relatively young science of implementation holds promises if fully leveraged in the complex contexts of healthcare systems.35 Both approaches overlap and use qualitative inquiry with those involved at the front end, the healthcare workers and their psychological and ergonomic daily reality. Of course, IPC success depends on safety culture in 12 general a nd its elements such patient -centeredness, as learning from errors and success, speaking up, etc. Complexity science should be added to useful sources in this respect.36 Data science, machine learning and artificial intelligence will see rapid growth in the next years and will have to be integrated in IPC with all the involved challenges such as high investment risks, data privacy and security, and data accuracy at their source. Sensor technology will collect valuable information on transmission pathways and infectious risks. This will allow to produce and understand process quality and HAI rates on a completely new level. 'Forgotten' HAI such as non -ventilator -associated pneumonia can be surveyed and in tegrated in prevention bundles. The involvement of patients through their access to medical information through web sources, mobile devices, and social media has to be taken into account. This might also bring surveillance of HAI in the ambulatory and home medicine in arms reach. The increasing focus on health -economic can have an advantageous or disadvantageous impact on IPC, can foster prevention to increase efficiency or increase infectious risk by decreasing quality of care. Reciprocally, IPC has to be an integral part of an overall governance of healthcare quality to resolve competing goals and achieve the optimal outcome for our patients: to regain and maintain health.

While the IOM recommended a specific framework o f actions and transformations to improve safety and quality of care with educ ation and training at its core, the implementation of this framework has varied greatly across systems . Today we note a heterogeneity of the content of these training programs (mainly focus on teamwork, safety and patient centeredness ) and of their target audience (mainly healthcare workers). However, to address the challenges that the Swiss health system is facing today and will face tomorrow , we also need to develop other domains of training such as quality management, process variation analysis , statistical process control and to insure that all the actors of the system s uch as policymakers, executives, operational leaders, clinical leaders, frontline staff are exposed to these education programs . Education and training in quality and safety must become a strategic element of the transformation of our system and it is imperative that a special effort be placed on continuing education to prepare today our professionals to me et the current and upcoming challenges. 3 Introduction Since the American Institute of Medicine (IOM) first published in 2000 \"To err is human \"[1] and \" Crossing the Quality Chasm\" [2] these two reports have had a profound and global impact on the delivery of care. They highlighted the huge problems o f safety and qualit y in healthc are. Before their publication the debate was limited to more technical and methodological aspects. These reports completely reoriented the debate from \"how to measure what is done\" to \"how to do improve what is done\" and they have been progressively adopted by the healthcare delivery systems, the politicians and the public. They described possible strategies , listed in table 1, for health systems to provide safe, effective, patient -centered, timely, efficient, and equitabl e care. The ultimate goal is to improve \"the degree to which health services for individuals and populations increase the likelihood of desired health outcomes and are consistent with current professional knowledge\" [3]. Health care system should be able to manage the six Quality dimensions below and deliver care that is: o Safe - avoiding injuries to patients from the care that is intended to help them. o Effective - providing services based on scientific knowledge to all who could benefit and refraining from providing services to those not likely to benefit (avoiding underuse and overuse, respectively). o Patient -centered - providing care that is respectful of and responsive to individual patient preferences, needs, and values and ensuring that patient values guide all clinical decisions. o Timely - reducing waits and sometimes harmful delays for both those who receive and those who give care. o Efficient - avoiding waste, including waste of equipment, supplies, ideas, and energy. o Equitable - providing care that does not vary in quality because of personal characteristics such as gender, ethnicity, geographic location, and socioeconomic status. Table 1: The six dimensions of quality of care [ 2] To meet the challenges associated with the implementation of the six dimensions of care health professionals must develop new skills. In 2003 the I OM defined five core competencies that all health professionals should possess, regardless of their discipline, to meet the needs of the 21st -century healthcare system : to provide patient -centered care, to work in interdisciplinary teams, to employ evidence- based practice, to apply quality improvement and to utilize informatics [4]. 4 Figure 1. The five core competencies for healthcare professionals to meet the needs of the 21st healthcare system [4] Over the years the implementation of the six dimensions of quality of care and the teaching and use of the five core competencies of the IOM's recommendations have varied greatly across national healthcare systems and within systems. The attention of the public, experts and governments has been more focused on the issue of safety of care than on the broader issue of quality of care. As a result most international and national organizations adopted strategies to emphasis the \" safety \" dimension of the delivery of care which had a considerable impact on their approach to transforming their systems . For example, the World Health Organization (WHO) recogniz ing the global need for patient safety launched in 2005 the First Global Patient Safety Challenge: \"Clean Care is Safer Care\" . It is followed in 2008 by the Challenge \"Safe Surgery Saves Lives\" to reduce risks associated with surgery and in 2017 by the Challenge \"Medication without Harm \" to reduce the level of severe and preventable harm related to medication. In parallel and to help with these initiatives the WHO developed the Patient Safety Curriculum Guide for Medical Schools and the Multi -Professional Patient Safety Curriculum Guide for healthcare professionals . On the other hand, only a few organizations or health systems have developed strategies based on the six Quality dimensions of care and the five core competencies . Among these organizations, the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) is certainly the most influential in the field of quality both nationally and internationally. Since it was started in 1991, it has promoted a systemic approach f or Quality Improvement (QI) and it is committed to redesigning healthcare into a system without errors, waste, delay, and unsustainable costs. Since 1996, i t organizes the most famous annual conferences on Quality and QI in the world, the \"Forum on Quality Improvement in Health Care\" held both in the USA and in Europe. Its success is based on a solid theoretical foundation in the field of quality improvement and its ability to carry out projects at all levels of the health system with all stakeholders. IHI has developed a training platform adapted to its different target audiences (clinicians and non-clinicians in volved in the healthcare system as well as managers and executives). It has established collaborations on many different topics in Europe with the healthcare systems of England, Scotland, Denmark, Sweden and Portugal. Among the health system s the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care has placed Quality and QI at the core of the transformation of its sys tem since 2006. It works in partnership with patients, consumers, clinicians, managers, policy makers and healthcare organizations to achieve a sustainable, safe and high -quality health system. Its strategic 5 priorities for the next four years are in the areas of patient safety ; partnering with patients, consumers and communities ; providing quality cost and value; and supporting health professionals to provide safe and high -quality care. In 2010, it launched the Australian Safety and Qual ity Framework for Health Care which specified three core principles for safe and high quality care: consumer centred, driven by information, and organized for safety. Today i t is applied in all parts of the Australian healthcare system. For each target audience (clinicians, managers, health service executives , board members and policy makers) specific \"Getting Started\" documents are used to facilitate the adoption and deployment of the model via concrete quality improvement projects. It is important to note with both the experience of IHI and the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care the importance of their training program anchored in a holistic approach o f quality covering the entire health system and adapt ed to the specific needs of the ir target audience. What about Switzerland? I. National agencies Following the publication of the report \"T o err is human \", the Federal Government created the National Patient Safety Foundation (NPSF) in 2003. It has a broad spectrum of activities on safety such as incident management , medication safety and safety culture. I n 2012, the NPSF launched the national programs \"Progress! \" which were an integral part of the Confederation's strategy for quality. The first pilot program Progres s! for surgical safety t ook place between 2013 and 2015 in 10 Swiss hospitals and was based on the WHO 's program \"Safe Surgery Saves Lives \". The second national program \"Medication Safety at the Transition\" got implemented in eight hospitals from 2015 to 2016. The third program \"S afety with Bladder Catheter\" was carried out in seven hospitals between 2015 and 2018. The fourth Progress program is still running and concerns the \"Safety of M edication in M edico- Social Establishments (EMS) \". The N PSF also organized two national congresses one in 2007 and another one in 2011 entitled \"Patient S afety - Avanti! \" which was a resounding success attracting more than 600 participants . It highlighted the many projects carried out throughout Switzerland and show ed the real interest of the health professionals to share and learn in the field of safety . In addition to the NPSF a second agenc y was created in 2009 the national association for quality development in hospitals and clinics (ANQ) which is in charge of national quality indicators for acute care, rehabilitation and psychiatry. It offers training to professionals focus ing on the use of these indicators and the interpretation of their results. However, t he ANQ does not offer training in the area of quality improvement. II. Universities and other institutions A. Source of information and results We conducted a survey of schools of medicine and nursing, university hospitals as well as other institutions (Hospital Federation of Vaud , Federation of Swiss Physicians , NPSF ) to get an overview of the training program offerings in the area of quality and safety of care. We did not take into account the internal training workshops given at hospitals or the activities developed within the medical disciplines for post -graduate training. Although not exhaustive, this survey presents a first overview of the training programs landscape for safety and quality across Switzerland. The results of our survey show the existence of (see details in the appendix) : 1. Formal structured continuing education programs in quality and safety university based as well as non- university based. 2. Short training education modules on quality and safety taught within formal continuous education or post -graduate programs in other disciplines. 6 3. Isolated training sessions on specific topics in quality and safety taught in different organizations. 4. Pre-graduate training taught within the professional schools such as schools of medicine and nursing. 1. Continuing education programs Four university continuing education programs in the area of quality and safety of care were identified (see T able 2 page 8 ). Of these programs, only one is targeted at middle managers, the other three are targeted at the frontline staff. The basic concepts and tools for quality improvement are taught in the four programs while those for safety in three of the programs. However not all the dimensions or topics of quality and safety are covered in these programs . We also identified a non- university continuing education program to train Patient Safety Officer (6 days, three evenings ) 2. Short training education modules These modules are a few hours to a few days in length covering the basic concepts of quality and safety. They are fragmented and housed within different formal programs lacking overall standardization of content. 3. Isolated training sessions on specific topics These include advanced sessions taught by experts in the field of quality and safety. They last from one to three days and offer a more in -depth teaching of the topics taught in the continuing education programs such as on teamwork, error and risk analysis, and management/strategy . 4. Pre-graduate training In order for medical students to be better prepared to meet the new challenges, their catalogue of competences was updated in 2017. The new catalogue Profiles is based on the well-known CanMEDS catalogue and defines the seven roles that a physician should have and the level of expertise that a physician must possess in each of these roles at the beginning of his / her postgraduate training [5]. However Profiles focus on safety and does not take into consideration the recommendations of the CanMEDS 2015 report of experts which list the expected competencies in quality improvement and patient safety in the seven CanMEDS' roles [ 6]. For example in his/her role of manager , the future doctor should have received: \"Training and proficiency in quality improvement methodol ogies important for active engagement in continuous quality i mprovement\". Thus, t here does not yet exist a quality and safety curriculum in our medical schools . The situation appears to be identical with the nursing and other healthcare professional schools even though there exist thematic courses on quality and safety. However in one of the five core competencies \"work in interdisciplinary teams\" a curriculum was developed as early as 2013 by the School of Health of Geneva (part of the University of Applied Sciences of Western Switzerland) for nurses, medical radiology technicians, dieticians, midwives and physiotherapists and starting in 2017 medical students were integrated. Pharmacists will join the program in 2019. This inter-professional training program is based on the acquisition of skills in inter -professional collaboration and cooperation through clinical situations with simulated patients. About 500 students are trained per year. To our knowledge this is the only integrated inter -professional curriculum for healthcare students taught over 3 years in Switzerland [ 7]. There also exists an inter -professional training program started in 2018 in Zurich ZIPAS (Z\u00fcrcher Interprofessionelle Ausbildungsstation ) using als o clinical situations with simulated 7 patients. The target audience is expected to be both students and professionals from a vast range of healthcare specialties. To be noted some countie s are equipped with simulation teaching centres such as in Geneva, Bern, Basel and Zurich. B. Lessons learned 1. Lessons learned from Swiss experience in the field of continuous training in quality and safety In 2008, Swiss Patient Safety launched an Error and Risk Analysis course in collaboration with the HUG as a training program in the French speaking part of Switzerland. Ten years later, nearly 500 health professionals were trained. Virtually all public hospitals and private clinics in French- speaking Switzerland used the same concept, the same methods of analysi s and the same language. This contributed to the development of a network of collaborators and institutions which favoured exchanges. The same positive experience was made for the CAS -DAS university courses in quality -safety of care as well as for the \"Pat ient Safety Officer\" training. The skills acquired by employees as we can observe in our hospitals had significant impact s on organizations in terms of quality improvement but the number of trained professionals remained limited. Promising programs on the concept of Breakthrough Collaborative developed by IHI1 have been implemented by the Hospital Federation of Vaud (FHV) for Hand Hygiene Improvement and pressure ulcers with some impressive results in terms of compliance to hand hy giene [8, 9] and risk reduction for pressure ulcers (oral communica tion). 2. Lessons learned from experi ence in the pre- graduate field Among the five core competencies of the IOM (see figure 1) it appears that the \"Apply quality improvement\" is the least taught in our country . This might be due to the fact that this competency comes from industries far removed from the health sciences and until recently were not used at all in healthcare. In addition, if we want to develop student competencies in Quality Improvement we must also first build faculty capacity. Some other countries are further along in their implementation of the five core competencies of the IOM. For example the Quality and Safety Education for Nurses (QSEN) project is an initiative to transform nursing education to fully integrate all of the IOM competencies defining specifically the knowledge, skills and attitude (KSAs) for each competency [ 10]. For the authors, the development of these KSA should \"prepare future nurses to continuously improve the quality and safety of the healthcare systems in which they work\". Likewise some medical and nursing schools are in the process to develop curriculums that allow students to learn quality improvement methods and apply them to a clinical quality improvement project [11][12]. Conclusion Numerous training programs have been set up in Switzerland in recent years in the area of quality of care, which shows a real interest and demonstrates many skills and expertise in this area. The teaching has been adapted and strengthened, particularly with regard to certain dimensions of quality such as patient -centred care and teamwork. New teaching methods have been introduced with simulation and patient -simulated to apply the acquired skills. It seems to have some weaknesses in the domain of quality improvement. These programs remain focused mainly on healthcare professionals. Non- clinician professionals, also indispensable to transform the system , seem \"to be left behind\". Our experience and the 1 A Breakthrough Series Collaborative is a short -term (6 - to 15- month) learning system that brings together a large number of teams from hospitals or clinics to seek improvement in a focused topic area 8 international literature on the topic points to the need for training all the actors of the health system both in the pre -graduate, postgraduate and professional areas. As well, the content of the training must be adapted to each target audience for the fi ve core competencies . The national, regional and local initiatives discussed are promising but remained fragmented and limited. To transform the Swiss healthcare system and engage its 250 000 workers will require that education and training must become a national and strategic priority. The skills acquired can then be mobilized in clinical QI initiatives such as to improve the management of patients with chronic illness or to reduce the adverse events associated with a technical procedure . Recommendations 1. Education and Training in Quality and Safety should become a strategic priority for the Federal and County Government s: a. Pre-graduate : A quality safety curriculum must be established for each pre- graduate program with formal evaluation of students' acquir ed skills/competencies b. Post-graduate : even if we didn't assess the post -graduate training for doctors, QI skills/competencies should be included in the medical societies' requirements c. Continuing -education: QI trainings should be developed for target audiences such as top managers (executive boards, boards of trustees), middle managers and the frontline. MAS level programs must be developed to train future QI experts 2. A national platform of communities of practices should be created to: a. Provide healthcare workers with QI training content b. Share knowledge and experience about QI initiatives c. Launch national challenge for clinical improvement initiatives 3. A national congress \"quality and safety of care\" should be created and could serve to announce and start the deployment of this strategic priority 9 Bibliography 1. Kohn LT, C.J., Donaldson MS, ed.

The results permit transparent and nationwide comparisons. Based on these results, hospitals and clinics can specifically develop measures for improvement of their quality. ANQ members include the Spitalverband H+, sant\u00e9suisse, curafutura, the in- surances, the the principality of Liechtenstein and the Swiss health directors' con- ference. Thus, all payers and service providers of Swiss health care are represented in the ANQ. The association's work is based on the health insurance act (Krankenversicher- ungsgesetz; KVG) ; the ANQ is not profit -oriented. The ANQ does international ly pioneering work: The partnership- based agreements , the co n- sensus -oriented cooperation of all tariff partners with a bottom -up approach and the manda- tory nationally comparative quality measurements that are consistent throughout the country and being published transparently are an international success and serve as a positive ex- ample. Opportunities: The ANQ quality measurements using scientifically accepted survey methods permit fair comparisons between the institutions within the meaning of best practices. They raise awareness among the institutions for quality subject s and serve the payers (can- tons/insurers) as indicators for the dialogue with the service providers (hospitals /clinics). Thresholds: The ANQ quality indicators were chosen in order to promote quality develop- ment - the measur ement results do not reflect the overall quality of an institution. According- ly, they are neither suitable for quality -dependent remuneration ( pay for performance) nor for sanctions against institutions with bad measurement results or ranking/hospital classifica- tions. The future challenges lie in the extension of the quality measurement into the outpatient area of hospitals, financing of inpatient services in connection with development of outpatient be- fore inpatient, further development of the measuring plan and timely communication of the ANQ measur ement results. Optimisation potential is present in intensification of the coordina- tion and networking between the parties and in responding rapidly to health- political devel- opments. 3 1) Swiss National Association for Quality Development in Hospitals and Clinics (ANQ) Corner points of the ANQ The Swiss National Association for Quality Development in Hospitals and Clinics (ANQ) co- ordinates and conducts quality measurements in acute somatics, rehabilitati on and psychia- try. The results permit transparent and nationwide comparisons. Based on these results, hospitals and clinics can specifically develop measures for improvement of their quality. ANQ members include the Spitalverband H+, sant\u00e9suisse, curafutur a, the Swiss social insurances, the cantons, the principality of Liechtenstein and the Swiss health directors' conference. Thus, all payers and service providers of Swiss health care are represented in the ANQ. The ANQ does internationally pioneering work: The partnership- based agreements, the con- sensus -oriented cooperation of all tariff partners with a bottom -up approach and the manda- tory nationally comparative quality measurements that are consistent throughout the country and being published transparentl y are an international success and serve as a positive ex- ample. Initiative of the healthcare area The ANQ activities are based on the Swiss health insurance act (Krankenversicher- ungsgesetz; KVG) from 1994 which stipulates that the service providers (hospitals and clinics) and the payers (insurers and cantons) incorporate contractually agreed quality assurance procedures including periodic performance review s. Hospital and clinic comparisons must also be carried out, in par ticular with regard to costs and the quality of the results . As a consequence of the KVG revision at the time, the Spitalverband H+, the industry associ- ation of the health insurances sant\u00e9suisse, all Swiss cantons and the Swiss social insurers (accident, military and disability insurance) founded the ANQ association in 2009. The main objective of the association was defined as consistent implementation of outcome measure- ments in the inpatient area of acute somatics, psychiatry and rehabilitation. In early 2018, the health insurance curafutura joined the association. Efficient structures The most important association bodies of the ANQ are the members' assembly and the board. As the highest committee, the members' assembly approves, among others, the strat- egy, the budget and the annual statement and elects the board members. The board manages the business of the ANQ. It has equal representation and consists of twelve persons: six represent the hospitals/clinics, three the c antons, three the insurances. One representative of the Swiss Federal Office for Health (BAG) joins as an observer without voting right. The board develops the strategy. In particular, it specifies rules on transparency and handling of data. Furthermore, i t determines the quality indicators and measur ement tools . When selecting them, it ensures internationally and scientifically accepted survey methods so that the results can be compared to those from other countries. 4 The office is subject to the board and supports it. The o ffice can rely on the expertise and experience of quality committees and ANQ expert groups. The quality committees are formed according to ANQ subject areas or interdisciplinary according to measuring subjects, and help implement the measurements and develop them further. ANQ expert groups rein- force current questions of ongoing quality measurements and intensely deal with central as- pects. Quality measurements, communication and support as main tasks The ANQ coordinates and implem ents quality measurements in inpatient acute somatics, rehabilitation and psychiatry based on the ANQ measuring plan and the quality indicators defined in it. It communicates the measur ement results to the ANQ partners and the public. In its activities, the ANQ is committed to the greatest scientific care and transparency. The ANQ regularly supports the persons responsible in the hospitals and clinics in the inter- pretation and use of the data by trainings and topic -specific workshops. The ANQ symposi- um Q-Day enables technical exchange within the meaning of best practice. Many repre- sentatives of the service providers and payers use the practice- oriented discussion and net- working platform around the ANQ measurements. Financing through member s and annual contributions The expenses for the ANQ association structure (office, committees, member administration) are financed by the annual membership contribution. The measur ement and evaluation costs of the ANQ are financed via the annual contributions of the hospitals and clinics. They depend on the number of inpatient stays in the respective area (in 2017, per discharge: somatics 2.70 CHF, psychiatry 9.88 CHF, rehabilitation 11.30 CHF). In return, the hospitals and clinics receive the measur ement tools , the measur- ing logistics, the evaluated results and the national compar ative reports. The ANQ is not profit -oriented. 5 2) ANQ quality measurements ANQ measuring plan and quality indicators The ANQ compiles concepts for measuring result -relevant national quality indicators in the three ANQ subject areas of inpatient acute somatics, psychiatry and rehabilitation on the order of the tariff partners (Spitalverband H+, sant\u00e9suisse, curafutura, the health directors' confer- ence) . The quality indicators are specified in the ANQ measuring plan, which is part of the national quality contract. ANQ bodies with experts from hospitals, clinics and ANQ partner organisations continually develop the measuring plan. New quality indicators must be particularly relevant, clearly comprehensible, practically useful and suitable for fair quality comparisons between the insti- tutions according to the transparently published criteria catalogue1. Experiences and feed- back from the hospitals and clinics are considered in the best manner possible. The measur- ing plan is widely supported and nationally accepted thanks to this procedure. The ANQ pursues a practical approach: The measurement results are to directly benefit the patient and the attending hospital staff. Another central item is that the institutions are able to use the data collected for quality measurement s as a basis for t he increase of their quality . The ANQ focuses on measuring selected and important quality aspects. The overall quality of an institution ther efore cannot be assessed based on the ANQ measurement results . The currently valid ANQ measuring plan indicating the quality indicators, methods and measur ement tools per ANQ subject area is enclosed. Swiss pioneering achievement The most notable features The ANQ has done a lot of development and conviction work in the ten years since its found- ing. Its achievements to date are international ly pioneering: The partnership- based agree- ments, the consensus -oriented cooperation of all tariff partners with a bott om-up approach and the mandatory nationally comparative quality measurements that are consistent throughout the country and being published transparently are an international success and serve as a positive example. National quality contract - a partners hip-based agreement The national quality contract from 2011 forms the basis for successful implementation of consistent quality measurements in the three ANQ subject areas . All Swiss hospitals and clinics, all cantons and all insurances acceded to this contract. They thus committed to par- ticipating in all ANQ measurements and financing them. Thereby, they also agreed to careful evaluation and transparent publication of the data. Implementation of countrywide and con- sistent quality measurements in hospitals and clinics is unique in the international context. 1 Cf. Criteria catalogue for new measuring subjects respectively quality indicators (document in German) 6 Partners in constant dialogue All tariff partners are continually in dialogue via the ANQ. This raises awareness for some different opinions and promotes a solution- oriented manner of action across the individual stakeholders and the different interests. Consensus -oriented procedures lead to high acceptance With the national quality contract, all important partners of healthcare, without exception, commit to the target of quality measurement and quali ty development, and to a shared ap- proach. This is a basic prerequisite for a national measuring system. Therefore, not only the statutory specifications are implemented, but targeted and pragmatic solutions are jointly developed, implemented and supported additionally. The procedure with equal say in the implementation of the measurements and the publica- tion of results offers better prospects of success than regulations passed by the authorities. For example, the evaluation and publication concepts for the individual indicators are devel- oped under inclusion of the basis and reviewed by the ANQ partners. This shared consen- sus-oriented procedure in the meaning of a bottom -up approach, coupled with as much ex- pert knowledge as possible, creates a high acceptance of the developed solutions among all parties . Transparent publication with fair hospital and clinic comparisons ANQ mandates independent organisations, usually institutes of universities or colleges, with processing and evaluation of the collected data. They evaluate the results scientifically and according to international standards. The data are subjected to a risk adjustment . Hospitals and clinics may differ considerably in their service offer, their infrastructures and their patient collectives. Risk adjustment can consider these differences and render the measurement results comparable. Since reality never can be mapped entirely, the ANQ always reminds of such differences and possible interpretation freedoms when communica ting measurement results . Fairness is not only an absolute requirement in data evaluation, but also in communication of the measurement results . They are presented in a graphically comprehensible manner , while reading aids and references to opportunities/risks of the ANQ measurements contribute to a correct interpretation of the results . The ANQ does not highlight any hospitals or clinics, nei- ther positively nor negatively, since accessibility of the measurement results to the public promotes competition anyway. The ANQ welcomes it if the results of the quality measurements are publicly discussed - but this should be done factually and according to the motto of \"dialogue instead of pillory\". 7 Opportunities and limits Opportunities: Quality development, raising awareness and dialogue The indicators selected by the ANQ are primarily suitable for quality development in Swiss hospitals and clinics. They supply the basics in order to trigger and implement targeted im- provement measures in the institutions. They permit fair comparison of the results between the individual institutions with respect to a specific indicator. Publication of the measurement results per hospital or clinic promotes competition among each other. Thanks to the transparent publication, it is now possible to make differentiated comparisons and to learn from each other - in the meaning of bench- marking and best practices . The nationwide consistent measurements are to permit , as far as possible, international comparison and corresponding benchmarking as well. The quality measurements raise awareness among the persons responsible in the hospitals and clinics for the respective quality subjects. This triggers learning processes. The individual measurement results offer hospitals important internal argumentation aids , e.g. for invest- ment in quality development , for process analyses, trainings, etc. The payers (cantons and insurances) use the ANQ quality measurements as indicators for the dialogue with the service providers (hospitals and clinics). Thresholds: Pay for performance, sanctions and hospital rankings The ANQ quality indicators were chosen explicitly in order to promote quality development - the measurement results do not reflect the overall quality of an institution. Accordingly, they are neither suitable for quality -dependent remuneration (pay for per formance) nor for sanc- tions against institutions with bad measurement results. The focus of the tariff partners should be mostly on whether the service providers actually use the ANQ data in their quality management. For the same reasons, the ANQ measurem ent results are also not suitable for rankings or hospital classifications, which are intended to serve patients as a basis for decision- making when choosing a hospital: the ANQ measurements measure only the quality of a very specif- ic indicator and not the overall quality. The ANQ disapproves of unauthorised, reduced or improper use of the measurement results by third parties and attentively monitors the devel- opment in the field of hospital search and comparison portals. Basics of quality development in institutions The responsibility for derivation, development and implementation of quality development measures based on the ANQ measurement results is deliberately kept with the hospitals and clinics. They know their operational processes best and are able to efficiently and specifically determine where they need to start improvements . The ANQ is not legitimated to take sanctions against the service providers or to apply any controlling mechanisms. The payers (cantons and insurances) are responsible for quality control and possible interventions. 8 3) A lot has been achieved in ten years Development and conviction work In the ten years of its existence, the ANQ has done plenty of development and conviction work: The structures of the ANQ with many different partners have been created and the demanding question of financing of the association and quality measurement has been an- swered. The core of this work is the national quality contract, in which the shared under- standing is recorded and the cooperation is stipulated. Initial resistances among the hospitals and clinics have mostly been overcome . Today, the hospitals and clinics share the intention of the nationally comparing, transparent ANQ measurements and are motivated to use the data gained for patient treatment and for quality development. Creation and further development of the ANQ measuring plan The ANQ measuring plan was developed in a consensus procedure among all ANQ part- ners. Implementation of the measuring concepts took place gradually between the three sub- ject areas . The farthest progress today is found in acute somatics, which has been imple- menting and developing the measuring concepts since 2011 already. In psychiatry, the measuring concepts have been implemented since m id-2012 and in rehabilitation since early 2013. As of the end of 2018, the measurement results from rehabilitation have first been transparently published - so that measurement results from all three areas on hospital/clinic level are now available. Improvement of data quality Good data quality is a prerequisite for the measurement results being published transparent- ly, i.e. including hospital and clinic names. The data quality has improved in all three specific areas across the years. The increasing experience of the hospitals and clinics in data collec- tion, clinic -specific reports on data quality, optimisation of the processes and offered ANQ trainings f or quality managers contribute to this development. Outcome: 2009 to 2019 As of today, 16 nationwide measurements across all three ANQ subject areas are compara- tively evaluated, with 12 of them transparently per hospital/clinic. The most important results are summarised below. Comparisons with the prior year are not possible everywhere for var- ious reasons (adjustments in the measur ement tools , insuffi cient data quality, first publication). 9 Outcome inpatient acute somatics: Acute somatics have measured patient satisfaction since 2011, using short question- naires on the satisfaction with relevant core areas. The results from 2011 to 2017 show a consistently high patient satisfaction across all survey items and across all years. The measurement of postsurgical wound infections in now 12 different types of interven- tion has been performed by Swissnoso, national cent re for infection prevention, on the order of the ANQ since 2009. Since the beginning of the transparent publication in 2011, the following infection rates reduced statistically significantly: Appendectomy (removal of the appendix), elective hip car- and without implant (spinal surgeries), stomach bypass surgeries. Rectum surgery, in contrast, showed a significant increase of the infection rate. Hospital infections, in particul ar postsurgical wound infections, are generally connected to the service quality of hospitals and clinics - due to which trans- parent publication is of great interest for the population and for the media. Since 2011, the ANQ has been measuring the potentially avoidable rehospitalisations (readmissions); since 2017, it has published the rates of the individual acute hospitals in a transparent manner. In 32% of the hospitals/clinics (basis: F ederal Statistical Office data year 2016 with publication 2018), the re were more readmissions than would have been expected based on the patient mix. It must be observed that potentially avoidable readmissions can only be influenced within limits by the hospitals; accordingly, a conclu- sion to treatment quality in the hospi tal is only partially possible. The rate of potentially avoidable re- surgeries is not disclosed for method- related reasons. Data on falls and decubitus ulcers (bedsores) is collected once per year. Among adults, the total decubitus ulcer rate has remained relatively stable for several years; it is at about 4%. The fall rate among adults also remains virtually stable across the year; it was 3.8% in 2017. Among children, a clear and significant reduction of the total decubitus ul- cer rate has been found since the measurements began: Between 2013 and 2017, it re- duced significantly and continually from about 15% to about 7%. These results show that the hospitals became strongly aware of the decubitus ulcer risk in children in the last years. Since September 2012, data on implanted hip and knee pros theses has been recorded in the implant register SIRIS . Since inclusion of the register in the ANQ measuring plan, all hospitals and clinics have been obligated to record hip and knee implants in the regis- ter. From 2012 to the end of 2016, the register has consistently documented more than 162,000 hip and knee prostheses (primary and revision surgeries). At the end of 2016, SIRIS achie ved a participation ratio of 96%. Specific statements on long- term behaviour and function duration of the implants will not be possible before the register has been operated for at least ten years. The same applies to possible quality comparisons. Recording of the spinal implants is to be included in the measuring plan in future - the corresponding development work and implementation plans are underway. 10 Outcome inpatient psychiatry: In psychiatry, patient satisfaction has been consistently measured nationw ide since 2017. The first transparent publication will take place in 2019, based on the data from 2018. The symptom burden has been measured since mid- 2012 in adult psychiatry and since mid-2013 in child and youth psychiatry . These ANQ measurements with self - and third- party assessment document that the psychiatric treatment reduces the symptom burden among patients between the admission and discharge. The load values at admission have slightly increased across the years (this means, the patients are increasingly bur- dened a little more at admission), but the psychiatric treatment also has been able to re- duce the symptom burden more strongly by discharge over time. All in all, the results confirm that the clinics have a high treatment qual ity. Since mid -2013, the proportion of freedom restricting measures (Freiheitsbeschr\u00e4nken - de Massnahmen; FM) has been recorded in adult psychiatry and child and adolescent psychiatry. Progress across the years shows a continuous slight increase of the share in cases with at least one FM in the total number of cases in both areas - we consider this due to improved documentation in the first years. In 2017, adult psychiatry showed the first slight reduction. T hese figures must be assessed under consideration that fewer FM does not necessarily equal higher quality, since the application of FM can be very differ- ent in practice. In clinics that use more FM than others, they may be applied for shorter periods than in those that use fewer FM. This depends on the i ndividual clinic concepts and patient collectives. Direct clinic comparisons therefore are not possible. Outcome inpatient rehabilitation: Rehabilitation has measured patient satisfaction since 2013, using short questionnaires on the satisfaction with relevant core areas. Evaluation of the results from 2013 to 2017 shows a positive overall image: Patient satisfaction is relatively stable on a very high level across the years. According to the measuring plan for rehabilitation, different methods and measur ement tools are used ( documentation of participation target and assessment of target achieve- ment, function in everyday activities, physical performance capacity, quality of life, gen- eral health status ) depending on rehabilitation area (musculoskeletal, neurological, oth- er, cardiac, pulmonary rehabilitation). The indicators are collected for every patient both at admission to rehabilitation and at discharge from it. The difference measures t reat- ment success. In November 2018, the results measured in rehabilitation were first pub- lished transparently based on the data measured in 2016. The e valuations showed that all clinics achieved an average improvement of function in everyday activities, pe rfor- mance capacity and quality of life, as well as the general health status, between admis- sion to and discharge from rehabilitation. 11 4) Future challenges and potential for optimisation The future challenges of the ANQ are diverse: Expansion of quality measurement into the outpatient hospital area: ANQ quality meas- urements are focused on the inpatient area only at the moment. In the medium - and long-term, measuring indicators for the outpatient hospital area are to be defined and in- cluded in the ANQ measuring plan. New financing of the i npatient performance in connection with development of outpatient before inpatient: The ANQ measurements are calculated via annual contributions of hospitals and clinics, based on the number of inpatient discharges. With development of \"outpatient before inpatient\" (easier cases are increasingly treated outpatient), the annu- al contributions for the ANQ are dropping. Financing of the ANQ quality measurements must be adjusted accordingly. Further development of the current m easurement plan: The ANQ and its expert bodies continually check how the measuring plan can be optimised and effectively developed further. The three subject areas acute somatics, psychiatry and rehabilitation currently proceeded independently of each othe r. One imaginable development is increasingly targeted at patient -oriented result measurement (alignment with the increase of well - being from the patient's point of view). Faster communication of the ANQ measurement results : the elaborated processes of data collection until transparent publication and the many interfaces between the part- ners and persons involved lead to the measurement results being ready for publication only one or two years after completion of data collection at the moment. The tendency i s towards reduction of the overall duration. The ANQ currently finds optimisation potential mostly in the following areas: Intensifying cooperation and networking: Cooperation and exchange between all actors in healthcare is good, but has space for further intensification. Faster political action: Healthcare is changing, many health- political questions influence the activities of the ANQ. It is desirable to quickly deal with the developments with suita- ble structures. Other current developments in healthcar e with implications for the ANQ activities: Ongoing KVG revision on quality and economic efficiency Introduction and further development of SwissDRG, TARPSY, ST Reha and outpatient tariff systems Further information on the ANQ, including detailed ANQ measurement results : www.anq.ch There are no potential conflicts of interest for the ANQ. 12 ANNEX ANQ measuring plan with quality indicators The ANQ measuring plan (as of January 2019) shows the quality indicators, methods and measur e- ment tools defined for each specific area.

Billing procedures bring revenues, and sustainability requires that revenues match fixed and variables costs. Procedures carry an intrinsic risk of complic ations and/or adverse outcomes. Preventive and surveillance measures use health care resources, and lead to additional costs. Despite precautions, errors happen, detected before or only after they hurt the patient. Correction implies additional procedures and costs. The cost to obtain quality (COQ) is the most reasonable balance between prevention/surveillance and correction costs, on top of production cost. Quality or risk management systems are expensive, requiring resources for set up, running and maintenance. Savings occur by decreasing variation of practices, segmenting patients by severity, avoiding duplications of procedures, and errors and complications. Their direct consequences are reductions in hospital length of stay and/or number of outpatient visits. Documenting savings makes return on investment visible. Economic studies in quality and safety are scarce, particularly in Switzerland. Quality and safety initiatives should include success factors and an economic analysis. They heavily depend from the information system. Changing healthcare workers' behaviour is difficult, and financial incentives not always successful. Two recent initiatives (ERAS and Smarter Medicine) encourage a critical assessment of quality and safety of delivering care. Savings come as a by -product, and could be seen as the contribution from health care workers to decreasing the high cost of the Swiss health care system. 3 The economic case for quality and safety Introduction Quality and safety in health care are very disputed subjects in all countries. Quality initiatives have soared and represent a huge market, with many methods proposed for use, and plenty of consultants advertising their services. However, health care managers are very reluctant to pay for these initiatives, because they are sceptic about their effectiveness, although they acknowledge that quality of care is of paramount importance for their institution. Finally, payers claim that they will not pay more for better quality, while at the same time, in most health care systems, they still reimburse procedures with complications, and thus poor quality. Surprisingly, data about the economic aspects of quality and safety systems and their impact on health care are scarce, particularly in Switz erland. This paper will describe the economic aspects linked with delivering health care procedures, as well as setting up and running quality and safety systems. It will describe in some details two recent initiatives associated with savings by optimising delivery of care and eliminating waste. Finally, it will identify success factors, as well as barriers and challenges, for setting up and running quality and safety systems, and issue some recommendations for improving the present situation in Switzerland . Cost of delivering health care In any health care system, costs can be divided into 2 main categories: - Fixed costs: infrastructure (building), equipment (investment), and personnel costs (the latter making up about 75% of the fixed costs, when the infrastructure costs are excluded). These fixed costs are not dependent from the number of procedures delivered, but linked with the decision to set up and deliver a given type of health care procedures. - Variable costs: any diagnostic and/or therapeutic pr ocedure implies a production cost made of 3 main components: time of health care workers needed (measured by their wages), cost of equipment used (through its maintenance and depreciation share), and costs of medical goods (laboratory tests, drugs, implants, etc). They are linked with the number of procedures delivered, and 4 bring revenues, when they can be billed to a payor (state, insurance, or patient (as deductible, co -payment or out- of-pocket)). A given health care system is only sustainable, when revenues match fixed and variables costs. The \"cost to obtain quality\" (Co\u00fbt d'Obtention de la Qualit\u00e9 = COQ) for an individual diagnostic and/or therapeutic procedure As most procedures are complex and invasive, they carry with them an intrinsic risk of leading to complications and/or adverse outcomes. Therefore, some additional measures are usually taken in order to prevent this risk from occurring, and still others to detect early the occurrence of complications. All these additional measur es lead to using health care resources, and thus to additional costs, increasing the bare production cost mentioned above. Some of these preventive measures are mandatory by law (for example screening blood donation for several virus), while others are rec ommended by guidelines of good medical practice (such as testing for blood groups and/or antibodies against some blood antigens), and still others are left to the health care worker's or institution's choice or experience (in this example, the type and frequency of controls carried out by the nurse during the blood transfusion infusion time). These preventive costs can be highly variable and sometimes sizeable. In the example of blood transfusion, one bag is billed in Switzerland about CHF 225, including virus screening. Testing for antibodies adds 30% or 53% to this price, depending on whether the blood group of the patient is known or not, respectively. If the patient has special antibodies, testing for them further increases the price of the bag by 84% or 107% for the same reason, respectively. Despite all these precautions, an error can happen, which can either be detected before it hurts the patient (for example a wrong blood transfusion bag is detected at the time of concordance checks carried out immed iately before it is infused), or unfortunately only after the procedure was completed (the same blood transfusion bag was effectively administered to the patient) without detecting it was not appropriate for this patient. The error must then be corrected, and this implies additional procedures, and hence additional costs, which can be sizeable, depending of the severity of the harm caused by the error. 5 As both extreme positions (taking all preventive measures to avoid any error from occurr ing, and taking no preventive measure and paying for the damages when they occur) are unsustainable because of their associated costs, the \"COQ\" is the most reasonable balance between prevention/surveillance and correction costs, which has to be added to the bare production cost (1). Plotting costs versus probability of error for any procedure gives a \"U- shaped\" curve, and the \"COQ\" of this procedure is the point on the curve where the costs are lowest. As patients are heterogeneous, because they have individual characteristics (such as age, and gender, or antibodies in the example of blood transfusion above), and a unique health history (summarised by comorbidities, and past surgeries), the balance just described is different for each of them, and can be assessed through severity scores. Therefore, the \"COQ\" for a given procedure can vary between patients. The cost of quality systems Quality systems available on the market for health care institutions ar e either inclusive (ISO (2), EFQM (3)), or partial, focusing only on some aspects of care (Sanacert (4)). Specific systems also exist for physicians in private practice (Equam (5)), and for different categories of physicians (ASQM (6)). In all cases, setting up the system is expensive, as it requires a lot of work for describing procedures in writing, diffusing them and having them applied. Running the system implies a formal process of continuous improvement, able to analyse observed results and compare th em with expected ones, and legitimate to take measures to correct the gap, if one is present. Finally, maintenance costs can be sizeable as well, with external audits required at regular intervals to keep the accreditation label. A systematic review, published in 2015 (7), of 7 studies published between 2005 and 2012, on the effect of ISO 9001 (4 studies) and EFQM models (3 studies) on hospital performance showed that both models improved patient satisfaction and safety, reduced average length of stay, impr oved waiting lists for invasive procedures, and decreased unplanned readmissions. However, only one study (8) involved cost issues, and showed a 6.1% drop in the cost of medical goods, and a 35.2% savings in laboratory cost. There are no data in the literature claiming that an inclusive system leads to better results than a partial one, and no specific data are available for Switzerland. 6 The cost of risk management systems To focus on risk management can be an alternative to a formal qual ity system. It improves the health care system only in specific fields, where an intervention was shown or is known to be effective (for example hand hygiene), or where an ex -ante risk analysis showed particular vulnerability (for example at the operating theatre), or on the basis of recorded errors or near -misses within a specific health care institution. If this approach can appear to require fewer efforts than the previous one, it nevertheless implies the same types of work and costs, including the cost of external (SanaCERT (4)) or internal audits (home- made system). It also requires that errors be detected, which is difficult when the health care system is made of several partners with loose links between them. This situation represents a particular challenge for physicians in private practice. In most institutions, both quality and risk management systems co -exist, and are run by the same people, allowing savings of scale. The savings from quality and safety systems Savings in health care are linked with a decrease in the amount of resources used to deliver a diagnostic and/or therapeutic procedure. This can occur in 4 different ways: - By decreasing the variation of practices between the different actors, through stand ardization of the procedures. It implies adopting and applying procedures, pathways, guidelines, or other tools of the same nature, measuring the compliance of the different actors to these tools, and taking steps to suppress deviance from the agreed proce dures. - By segmenting patients by severity of risk and/or of illness, and adapting the intensity of both preventive and therapeutic procedures applied to them accordingly. For example, for a given patient, the risk of developing a pressure ulcer will depend from his/her nutritional status, as well as from the duration and type of surgery contemplated. Similarly, the treatment of a grade 4 pressure ulcer will necessitate more intensive treatment measures than those needed for a grade 1 ulcer (9). - By avoiding duplication of laboratory and/or radiologic diagnostic procedures, or multiple drug treatments, because the information is not available when needed, 7 or because the patient is treated by multiple physicians not coordinated between them. - By avoiding errors and complications, which require additional diagnostic and/or therapeutic procedures to correct them. Well -documented examples are avoiding blood stream infection by hand hygiene, or pressure ulcer by early mobilization. The most important direct consequences of these 4 types of actions are the reductions of the hospital length of stay (LOS) and/or of the number of outpatient visits, both planned or in emergency, needed to take care of the patient. Avoiding using expensive diagnostic proce dures and drugs or implants is an additional consequence in some cases. Documenting these observed savings is very important to convince managers to invest in quality and safety procedures, because they can concretely see a return on investment, that might even by far offset the additional resources needed to get this kind of results, depending on the domain under study. International examples of systematic reviews of economic analyses on quality and safety Published examples exist in different domains, both in hospital and in private practice. The following 4 examples will provide an illustration of the subject, and of the difficulties to document some of the savings, as compared with the easily available cost of the interventions. - Central venous catheters insertion: a systematic review of 15 studies, with data from 113 hospitals, showed that the practice recommended by the Agency for HealthCare Research and Quality for inserting central venous catheters reduced the risk of bloodstream infection by 57%, and resulted in net savings of $1.85 million per hospital. Net savings offset additional program cost by $3.15 for each $1 invested (10). - Antibiotics: a systematic review of 5 studies on programmes of antimicrobial stewardship showed that their implementation may be cost- effective from a hospital and/or payer's perspective (11). - Hospital readmissions: a systematic review of 50 studies, half of them with patients suffering from heart failure, showed that in this patient population, interventions resulted in average net savings of $972 per patient, whereas in patients suffering from other conditions, interventions resulted in an average net 8 loss of $169 per patient. However, if the intervention engaged both patients and caregivers , net savings were greater (12). - Diabetes: a systematic review of 46 studies of diverse designs showed that non- randomized controlled studies were associated with more favourable results. In the 19 randomized -controlled studies, glycaemic control, as meas ured by HbA1c, was improved by 0.26%, or 3 mmol/l, at an incremental net cost of $116 per patient annually. Long -term incremental cost- effectiveness ratios ranged from dominant (i.e saving money) to costing up to $100'000/Quality -Adjusted Life - Year (QALY) gained (13). Swiss examples of economic analyses in quality and safety Very few examples of economic analyses of interventions to promote quality and safety have been carried out in Switzerland. Three examples from Ticino, the most active Canton in this field, are summarised below. - Implementation of guidelines on routine pre- operative testing: a 6 -month strategy of meetings with health care professionals from 6 hospitals of Canton Ticino showed a statistically significant reduction in the probability of patient undergoing some routine pre- operative tests (81% for coagulation tests, 73% for creatinine, and 43% for chest x -ray), translating in costs savings of about CHF 68'000 for 3 months in 1998 (14). - Economic burden of unjustified medications at hospital discharge: on a sample of 318 out of 577 patients, 619 out of 3691 prescriptions were deemed unjustified, for a mean monthly cost of \u20ac32 per patient or about \u20ac19'000 per month. Gastrointestinal agents amounted to 46% of the total costs, of which 34% were related to proton pump inhibitors (15). - Prescription practices for antibiotics in a medium -sized Swiss hospital: over a 6 - months period, 129 patients' antibiotics prescription was reviewed. Overall, adherence to guidelines was 71%, and 58% had delayed switch from intravenous to oral form (mean delay of 5 days), resulting in additional pharmacy costs (the intravenous form being about 10 times more expensive than the oral form), and additional hospital isation costs (16). 9 These examples were published between 2002 and 2009, and no information is available about their long -term impact. It is dubious that these studies had a widespread impact, as these fields are still in the top -lists of unnecessary prescriptions today. Recent initiatives in Switzerland Two recent initiatives can be ascribed to quality and safety measures, leading to potential important savings. The first one focuses on surgical care and is called \"Enhanced Recovery After Surgery\" (ERAS), and the second is more widespread in medicine and called either \"Choosing Wisely\" or \"Smarter Medicine\". ERAS This initiative was launched in the late 1990s. It aims at optimising patient's preparation to surgery, decreasing surgical and anesthesiological trauma during surgery, and optimising post- operative recovery, through 20 measures grouped into care bundles (17). The initial improvement in clinical outcome (18) could be replicated in colorectal surgery at a Swiss tertiary hospital , and translated into savings amounting to CHF 1'981 per patient, mainly through a decrease of nearly 50% in LOS in abdominal surgery, which offset the additional specific cost of ERAS of CHF 1'213 per patient (19). The same findings could be observed in thoracic surgery, with savings amounting to CHF 3'686 per patient, through a nearly 60% decrease in the numbers of complications, translating into a 43% decrease in LOS, again offsetting the additional specific cost of ERAS of CHF 729 per patient (20). Smarter Medicine Smarter Medicine was launched in 2012 in the USA and spread to Canada and Europe. It is based on the fact that some diagnostic and/or therapeutic procedures are routinely prescribed, by habit or tradition, but are not associated with any b enefit for the patient. As some of these procedures are invasive, or likely to give false positive results, they might even harm the patient. As a consequence, they represent wasted resources, and can be eliminated without adverse consequences. Each society of specialists was asked to provide a list of the 5 procedures that might be suppressed without adverse consequences (Top -5 lists). These lists were published on Internet and in the specialised literature, as well as in the media. 10 In Switzerland, a Smarter Medicine Society was launched in 2014, and up to date, 8 societies of specialists published a Top -5 list on the web (21). This initiative is very interesting, as it has some features in common with the theory of lean management, which focuses on eliminating waste, without altering the quality and safety of the underlying procedure. As a consequence, some of the tools and practices of lean management could be adopted in Smarter Medicine (22). This initiative might eventually lead to the effective implementation of findings published, with their cost consequences, by Swiss authors in the last 15 years (14 -16). Both ERAS and Smarter Medicine are original and might be effective, because they do not focus on cost issues, and thus do not meet resistance from health care professionals, who are most responsive to the aspects of quality of care and safety of their patients. Success factors One of the key incentives for setting up a quality and safety system is the available evidence that some imp rovement is possible in the structure, processes and/or outcome of a given health care institution. In the Swiss health care system, the regular publication of quality indicators by the Federal Office of Public Health (23) and the National Association for the development of Quality in hospitals and clinics (ANQ(24)), with the identity of individual hospitals, is a very potent stimulus in this field. A second key factor is to have the executive board of the institution understand the importance of paying attention and devoting resources to quality and safety because of the impact that accidents in this field can have on the image of their institution, with potentially disastrous financial consequences. A third key factor is the ability to identify an internal champion, able to carry out the role of ambassador. He/she should first show that the system works in his/her own field, and then convince his/her colleagues to adopt the same system in their respective field. Quality and safety are in this respect highly contagious diseases. One last key factor is the ability to identify savings linked with quality and safety interventions, because it will attract the interest of administrators, and made it easier to get the required investment to set up the quality and s afety system. 11 Barriers and challenges One of the key challenges for monitoring hospital or private practice performances is the availability of data. If they are not routinely collected, as for example included in the dataset that hospitals are required to send yearly to the Federal Office for Statistics, any additional data retrieval needs additional resources. Studies available in the literature on this subject are heterogeneous both in types of data and methods, so that the results of a systematic review including 8 studies \"weakly indicate that collection of hospital data and improvement in data recording can be cost- saving\" (25). A second challenge is to be able to fulfil the success factors described above, in order to push the institution into this move and effort, as the inertia in the health care system is really important. A third challenge is linked to the fact that many heal th care professionals are needed in the care of a given patient. This makes information transfer and availability critical for efficiency, and implies a well developed and interconnected information system (26). Unfortunately, in the Swiss health care system, legal requirements for an electronic patient chart are different between the hospital and outpatient sectors. This represents a huge barrier against efficiency of care, as well as quality and safety, which will be very difficult to overhaul. Finally, s ome actors complain that quality and safety initiatives need additional funding to be launched and sustained. Some countries have tried to introduce financial incentives for physicians and hospitals to provide care of good quality and in adherence to clini cal practice guidelines. This initiative, called \"Pay -for-Performance\" (P4P) showed mixed results in the USA and UK, both in hospital (27) and private practice settings (28). Studies in the field of behavioural economics have recently shown that, contrary to the traditional economic view that money is the only or main motivator for observed behaviours, \"monetary reward can undermine motivation and worsen performance on cognitively complex and intrinsically rewarding work, suggesting that pay-for-performance may backfire\" (29). Therefore, introduction of P4P in Switzerland is probably not the solution for improving quality and safety of care. Recommendations Changing healthcare workers' behaviour is difficult, as it is shaped early at medical or nursing scho ols, and later moulded in clinical wards by contact with senior physicians and nurses, not always aware of the latest medical development in their field. Hospital 12 management cannot necessarily suppress heterogeneity of practice within the institution, and guidance implementation on best practice by simple dissemination is ineffective. In this field, it is essential that lessons learned from other countries be replicated in Switzerland. The National Institute for Excellence (NICE) in UK has recently published some recommendations for achieving high -quality care (30), which could be adapted to the local healthcare system. Quality and safety initiatives should therefore include the following characteristics: - Include all actors involved in the field under study - Identify champions as ambassadors for the project - Use routinely available data or as few data to be acquired as possible - Include an economic arm to the project in order to identify and compute both additional costs and expected saving - Win the support of the executive board of the involved institutions In this perspective, the 2 recent initiatives (ERAS and Smarter Medicine) are probably the best way to encourage a critical assessment of quality and safety of procedures of care, and should be encouraged. The savings incurred come as a by -product, and could be seen as the contribution health care professionals can bring to decreasing the high cost of the Swiss health care system. 13 References 1.

Executive summary Critical Incident Reporting Systems (CIRS ; sometimes referred to as reporting and learning sys- tems ) have been incorporated in the Swiss healthcare system 's clinical risk management proto- cols for many years. This dates back to 1996, when the University Hospital Basel and its de- partment of anaesthetics introduced \"CIRSmedical \". The assumed direct benefit of CIRS reports - improvements resulting in the prevention of errors - led to the adoption of CIRS s by almost all acute inpatient facilities in the ensuing years. A variety of networks also emerged, above all the national CIRRNET network initiated by the Stiftung Patientensicherheit Schweiz (Swiss Patient Safety Foundation). Initial euphoria over the operation of CIRS s gave way to the realisation that data gathered on a voluntary basis does not permit conclusions about the safety of a healthcare institution: the multiple bias in the data means any quantitative analysis must be treated with caution. The main problem that has always affected CIRS in Switzerland is that the confidentiality of incident reporting does not enjoy legal protection here, unlike in other countries. The absence of other, more reliable, d ata creates an appetite for opening up CIRS, which puts at risk the very basis for its success. Legislators need to act if CIRS is to continue being deployed in the Swiss healthcare system going forward. A guarantee of confidentiality in respect of CIRS is urgently needed in the Swiss healthcare system to foster learning from mistakes without fearing the consequences. Incident Reporting & Safety Learning \u00a9 Stiftung f\u00fcr Patientensicherheit Schweiz 4 1 The early days of critical incident reporting systems (CIRS s) In the 1970s the Australian Patient Safety Foundation became the first in the world to lay the initial foundations for the introduction of cross -disciplinary national CIRS systems with the Aus- tralian AIMS Programme[1]. In Europe, Switzerland took its first step in operating CIRS systems in 1996. 1.1 Pioneers of the CIRS in Switz erland (1996) In 1996, the Department of Anaesthesiology at the University of Basel introduced the internet - based Swiss Critical Incident Reporting System (CIRS). To create a uniform system for reporting critical incidents in the Swiss healthcare system, in 2001, on the basis o f many years of experi- ence and in collaboration with the FMK, the SBK/ASI and NASA psychologists, a data set was defined for a generic anonymous CIRS to develop CIRSmedical, a system that could be used for the entire range of clinical medicine, making it available to a wide range of healthcare insti- tutions. CIRS systems were implemented at many hospitals as the importance of patient safety for Swiss healthcare continued to grow. Even though many questions in relation to the liability of people who report errors and incidents were not fully clarified, CIRS systems with different objectives were implemented and operated. 2 Further development of CIRS systems after the early days (2000 -15) As things developed further, CIRS systems became a vital component of clinical risk manage- ment systems. They were most widespread in acute inpatient care facilities; less so in other sectors of care in the Swiss healthcare system. The level of implementation was very heteroge- neous, and remains so to this day. No nationwide overview of healthcare establishments that have implemented a CIRS exists to date. The early euphoria gave way to a debate, lasting many years, on the obligatory use of CIRS systems. Initially great credence was given to the utility and effectiveness of CIR S systems. For example an expert survey on patient safety in Switzerland conducted in 2008[2] concluded that introducing a CIRS was one of the most useful measures for improving patient safety. The idea that anyone operating a CIRS was automatically doing clinical risk management and living a culture of safety and learning prevailed for a long time, even in specialist circles - until an in- creasing amount of practical experience became available. 2.1 Swiss study on clinical risk management (2008) The year 2008 saw the first study of clinical risk management in Switzerland. It was conducted by ETH Zurich' s Centre for Organisational and Occupational Sciences[3] in collaboration with the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences Institute of Business and Regional E conomics. The goal of this practice -oriented research project was to investigate the current situation and planned development in clinical risk management at Swiss hospitals. The findings showed that at that time (2008), systematic/clinical risk management was still a new field for many hospitals, alt- hough it had already gained in importance. Among other things, the national survey covered aspects related to CIRS systems. Around half of the hospitals taking part in the survey (n = 138) had a person responsi ble for the central coordination of clinical risk management activities. Hos- pitals were using a relatively broad spectrum of measures to enhance patient safety. One of these measures was operating a CIRS. In 2008, around 40 per cent of the hospitals that r e- sponded had a CIRS and were analysing the origins of error reports. In charge of running the Incident Reporting & Safety Learning \u00a9 Stiftung f\u00fcr Patientensicherheit Schweiz 5 CIRS in most cases were decentralised personnel resources who were responsible for operating the local CIRS in addition to their routine clinical work as doctors or nurses. 2.2 Swiss CIRRNET\u00ae network (2006) In line with the idea that it was not only possible to learn from one' s own mistakes, but that critical events at other locations could also be of key importance, there was a growing trend to establishing networks. A wide range of different types of network emerged, most notably the CIRRNET\u00ae. In 2006 the Critical Incident Reporting & Reacting NETwork (CIRRNET\u00ae) was es- tablished by the Swiss Patient Safety Foundation in cooperation with the Swiss Society of An- aesthesiology and Reanimation (SGAR -SSAR) with the support of the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH). CIRRNET\u00ae is the network of local CIRS systems in Switzerland. The network enables affiliated healthcare institutions to forward anonymised CIRS reports to the CIRRNET\u00ae database and thus make them available on a password- protected basis to all the network part- ners for internal learning purposes. The goal is to learn from mistakes and identify cross -region- ally and/or nationally relevant problem areas of patient safety. Along the lines of \" from reporting to reacting\" , problem areas identified are worked on with experts at different healthcare institu- tions and organisations, and practical recommendations (so -called Quick -Alerts\u00ae) are published on a broad basis. During the pilot phase from 2006 to 2010, 12 hospitals and their anaesthesiology clinics partic- ipated in CIRRNET\u00ae. After a successful evaluation in 2010, CIRRNET\u00ae was opened to all Swiss healthcare establishments and all medical disciplines. In 2018 a total of 82 healthcare establish- ments, predominantly in acute inpatient care, were affiliated with CIRRNET\u00ae. CIRRNET\u00ae is funded by the Swiss Patient Safety Foundation, the cantons and network participants. 2.2.1 Quick -Alerts\u00ae As a result of the processin g of cross -regionally/nationally relevant problem areas in patient safety, from 2006 to 2018 a total of 46 Quick -Alerts\u00ae were formulated and published by the Patient Safety Foundation. Quick -Alerts\u00ae are concisely worded recommended improvements and warning s on the basis of individual, relevant, topical and easily definable problems in patient security. These problem areas of pan -regional relevance are identified from the CIRRNET da- tabase. Quick -Alert recommendations are developed in collaboration with various experts and made available to all healthcare professionals with an interest. To look into the propagation of Quick -Alerts\u00ae within healthcare establishments and get an idea of how these practical recommendations are passed on within them, in 2013 the foundation held a written survey of quality and risk managers at all Swiss hospitals. This survey[4], conducted with the psychology of work in organisations and society research group at ETH Zurich, was designed to evaluate the use and practical utility of Quick -Alerts\u00ae at healthcare institutions. The quality and usefulness of Quick -Alerts\u00ae were deemed to be positive. Quick -Alerts\u00ae raise em- ployee awareness of specific hot spots in patient safety, and provide concrete tips on how to improve and avoid errors. In most cases they are passed on to different professional groups within an institution, and are often discussed with the medical service. Quality and risk managers see reading the Patient Safety Foundation' s Quick- Alerts\u00ae and forwarding them to \"affected \" staff and departments within their organisation as one of their duties. Given that Quick -Alerts\u00ae receive formal approval from Swiss professional associations, these practical recommendations enjoy a high level of acceptance in professional circles, and a re also cited internationally. Incident Reporting & Safety Learning \u00a9 Stiftung f\u00fcr Patientensicherheit Schweiz 6 3 Current snapshot More than 20 years after the introduction of a CIRS at a Swiss hospital, different experience has been gathered, and various developments can be observed. The pivotal problem in relation to operating CIRS systems is still that there is no statutory confidentiality safeguard when it comes to reporting on critical incidents, and that negative consequences for the culture of learning and safety and a decline in people' s willingness to report can therefore be expected. Added to this, a justifiable interest on the part of the public and patients, insurers and government regulators (the federal, cantonal and municipal authorities) with respect to healthcare safety data cannot be satisfied with CIRS systems. The mi sconception that CIRS systems allow conclusions to be drawn about the safety of treatments persists in many places, and leads to false expectations of CIRS data. 3.1 Legal framework for operating reporting and learning systems Confidentiality protection and protection from prosecution are the key to the successful operation of a CIRS, and crucial to the culture of safety and learning at Swiss healthcare establishments. The problem, however, is that unlike other countries , Switzerland has so far had no legal regu- lations governing the way reports in reporting and learning systems are dealt with. Therefore, notifiers in these systems are not protected from the possibility that their notifications could be consulted and used in criminal proceedings. There is a y awning gap in the law that is discon- certing for people reporting incidents and reduces their willingness to do so. As long as a CIRS can be utilised for criminal proceedings, people working for Swiss healthcare establishments will have to fear harmful cons equences for themselves, their colleagues or the healthcare establish- ment if they report incidents and errors. The patient rights legislation in Germany[5], for example, shows that reporting that is not subject to prosecution does not conflict with prosecution in cases of gross negligence. Similar rules would be welcome in Switzerland. It is high time that Switzerland introduced legal regulation in the form of a guarantee that the output of CIRS systems will only be used for specific purposes. Efforts to br ing about such a change in the law have been under way since back in 2001.[6] 3.2 Obligatory CIRS systems There is no legal obligation at federal level to operate a CIRS. On the basis of the cantonal regulation of the Swiss healthcare system, however, there are cantonal laws and agreements between departments of health and healthcare establishments. Since 2014, for example, Can- ton Valais has imposed a reporting requirement on its hospitals by way of an ordinance on healthcare quality and patient safety.[7] The same applies for Canton Ticino, which has also established a duty to report medical incidents in its cantonal healthcare legislation.[8] By way of the Zurich hospital list and its annex, Canton Zurich obliges its acute inpatient facilities to opera te a CIRS.[9] Other cantons, within their quality and patient safety policies, urge healthcare estab- lishments to operate a CIRS, but do not explicitly require them to do so. Canton Graub\u00fcnden, for instance, in its ordinance to the healthcare act, requires its public -law hospitals to participate in the CIRRNET network, which presupposes that hospitals operate a local reporting and learn- ing system.[10] Reporting incidents in the CIRS is basically voluntary, but healthcare institutions are no longer free to ch oose whether that operate a CIRS. CIRS systems and the resulting learning steps are very important, and given that this information is indispensable in terms of assuring patient safety, are part of the core duties of any healthcare institution. For this reason, all healthcare establishments should be obliged to operate a CIRS system, and the requisite legal protective provisions should be initiated. Incident Reporting & Safety Learning \u00a9 Stiftung f\u00fcr Patientensicherheit Schweiz 7 4 Lessons learned after more than 15 years of CIRS systems in Switzerland Incident reporting and learning (CI RS) systems are not the only form of system for generating reports on undesired medical incidents. From the moment the Swiss healthcare system started implementing them, their ability to generate reliable data on medical incidents has been overes- timated. T hey are not an appropriate tool for the quantitative capture of treatment errors. They are neither sensitive nor specific. This fact was recognised many years ago, prompting an on- going discussion around suitable, more sensitive systems for capturing such i nformation. Up until now, CIRS systems have had to contend with the problem that there is often no clear evidence of the efficacy of improvement measures, but at the same time, the complexity and the need to develop and establish the importance of a culture of safety and learning mean they are a key component of any clinical risk management system. Quantifying treatment errors in the healthcare system is a matter of great concern for healthcare policy makers (federal and cantonal), insurers, the public at large and other stakeholders. This is basically understandable. For this reason, with all the different, justified interests involved, the goal and interest in obtaining insight must always be defined first before the appropriate tool or procedure for gathering data is decided. Practice to date shows that for want of systematic, mandatory reporting systems for defined incidents in the context of the medical treatment of patients, expectations of reporting and learning (CIRS) systems are aroused that do not tally with the purpose of CIRS systems. Given the under -reporting, the findings of analysis must be viewed with extreme caution. The operation of reporting and learning systems has to be seen from two points of view: in the context of a healthcare establis hment 's operations, and in the overall context of healthcare provision and managing patient safety. 5 Need for action and recommendations for CIRS systems in Swiss healthcare Continuous monitoring by way of regular national surveys of officers responsible for clinical risk management is a key measure when it comes to promoting awareness of forward- looking, sys- tematic risk management and supporting healthcare institutions in their ongoing efforts to de- velop. However, as long as there is no legal regulation governing the compulsory gathering of data on treatment safety, data will be captured unsystematically and for different purposes that are not primarily intended or suitable for managing Switzerland 's healthcare system. The Swiss Patient Safety Foundation draws attention to the necessity and urgent need for action in terms of ensuring that data on treatment safety are captured systematically (see chapter 5 of \"Harm to patients in Switzerland - an overview\", contribution to the Swiss National Report on Qual ity and Safety in Healthcare by S. Z\u00fcllig) and preventing a situation where CIRS systems are relied on for want of appropriate data. It is worth protecting CIRS systems and the reports they generate on medical incidents from the authorities ' subpoena for p roduction of evidence; they should only be used for the purpose of identifying and analysing problem areas in patient safety and devising and implementing improvements. As long as the law fails to provide rules protecting the operation of reporting and learning systems in Switzerland, the Swiss Patient Safety Foundation recommends that healthcare institutions reduce the legal risk as far as pos- sible by taking organisational measures such as anonymising and destroying original critical incident reports. Recommendation of the Swiss Patient Safety Foundation 1. The management of any healthcare establishment should clearly define what should be reported in the local reporting and learning (CIRS) system. All employees should be made aware of this definition. Incidents involving damages and/or potential damages should not Incident Reporting & Safety Learning \u00a9 Stiftung f\u00fcr Patientensicherheit Schweiz 8 be reported in reporting and learning systems. Reporting and analysis techniques should be taught and trained. 2. Every CIRS should make it possible to report anonymously. In concrete terms, this me ans that the identity of the person reporting (and the patient) must not be passed on to third parties. It can, however (at least initially) be known to the team operating the reporting sys- tem. 3. There must be no cross -references between reporting and learni ng systems and patient dossiers/medical records and other medical documents. 4. All incidents and persons reported in a reporting and learning system must be systematically anonymised and de -identified. No personal data may be viewed or saved within the frame- work of a CIRS report. If necessary, reports must be further anonymised and de- identified before they are processed, forwarded or published. 5. Incidents involving damages and/or potential damages must be deleted from the CIRS and if necessary reported and documented in a separate system for damage cases. 6. Employees must not suffer any disadvantage for the incidents they report. In particular, they must not be held responsible for system errors. 7. If a healthcare institution is subpoenaed by the judicial authori ties to produce evidence, after careful consideration sealing of the evidence must be demanded.

Annex to the 2012 Zurich hospital lists for acute care, rehabilitation and psychiatric care: general requirements (Version 2018.01; https://www.gr.ch/DE/institutionen/verwal- tung/djsg/ga/dienstleistungen/aufsichtbewilligungen/Gesundheitsgesetz/Ver- ordnung%20zum%20Gesundheitsgesetz.pdf Short Report for Swiss National Report on Quality and Safety in Healthcare Healthcare from the point of view of patients DVSP (the umbrella association of Swiss patients' organisations) 2 Abstract: The Swiss healthcare system has major advantages for members of the public, but also certain disadvantages that can have serious implications for patients. One great advantage is that the entire population has access to healthcare. One great disad- vantage, on the other hand, is the fact that there are gaps in the quality and safety of the healthcare provided to patients. These gaps are due to the fragmented nature of the healthcare system and the dual levels of authority and responsibility (the cantons and the federation). But t hey are also due in no small measure to the fact that Switzer- land has no comprehensive, binding quality assurance approach that is subject to con- trol. The healthcare system is on the whole very good, but there are serious gaps evident in a number of areas . There is a particularly urgent need for action when it comes to the quality of, for example, medication, the individual benefits of treatment, invasive procedures, defining indications, identified sources of error, interfaces between inpa- tient and outpat ient care, hygiene, etc. In many of these areas , there have long been important insights and proven solutions just waiting to be implemented. The federalist structure of the healthcare system will only work from the patient point of view if powers and res ponsibilities are tied more closely to the federal authorities and made subject to binding regulation across the country, particularly in the context of quality assurance, which should be coordinated and monitored by a single body. The status of patients in Switzerland is poor compared with neighbouring countries. While the bodies representing them are involved in various working groups run on a federal, cantonal, municipal and private basis, there is no funded, delegated co- deter- mination for patients at t he federal level such as exists, for example, in the Netherlands. The rights and duties of patients are set down in various federal and cantonal laws and ordinances. The result is that these can even differ from canton to canton. 3 Healthcare from the point of view of patients The Swiss healthcare system has major advantages for members of the public, but also certain disadvantages that can have serious implications for patients. One great advantage is that the entire population has access to healthcare. One great disad- vantage, on the other hand, is the fact that there are gaps in the quality and safety of the healthcare provided to patients. Some of these gaps are due to the fragmented nature of the healthcare system and the dual levels of aut hority and responsibility (the cantons and the federation). But they are also due in no small measure to the fact that Switzerland has no comprehensive quality assurance approach. While areas such as health insurance, the protection of health, and research involving humans are regu- lated at the federal level, responsibility for healthcare is in the hands of the cantons. At the same time both levels coordinate and run joint projects on the federal/cantonal platform, for example via the cancer and e- health str ategies, or the framework agree- ments set down between the Swiss Federal Department of Home Affairs (FDHA) and the Swiss Conference of the Cantonal Ministers of Public Health (GDK) on the imple- mentation of the electronic patient record. From the patient 's point of view, although this federalist structure can lead to differences in the ways laws are implemented and different payers, it can also facilitate the rapid launch of projects in areas such as pre- vention, as numerous current initiatives demonstrate. Th e federal and cantonal author- ities bear the main responsibility for healthcare, with municipal authorities and private actors also contributing by way of different projects. The consequences of a federalist structure The result of the federalist set -up of Swiss healthcare is a fragmentation into 26 can- tonal healthcare systems. We believe Switzerland is too small for that to represent patients and insured people. While the federal constitution and federal legislation set down the framework for the cantons t o provide healthcare to the public, responsibility for implementation rests primarily with the cantons. This means that each canton is obliged to assure the entire population access to high- quality healthcare in the event of illness and accident. While eac h canton for its part is a member of the Conference of the Cantonal Ministers of Public Health, the power to decide and the responsibility for decisions ultimately rests with the canton alone. This federalist set -up has also led to a system lacking in transparency, which results in legal inequality and duplication of effort - on the one hand because powers and responsibilities are concentrated in such small areas, in most cases ending at the cantonal border, and on the other hand be- cause a system of this sort cannot guarantee quality and quality assurance, despite the fact that quality assurance has been a legal requirement ever since the introduction of the Federal Health Insurance Act in 1996. When assessing the suitability of this federalist system as an instrument in healthcare from the point of view of patients, we have to focus primarily on quality and quality assurance. For this reason, this is also the area we focus on in the following pages. It includes the rights of patients and their status. 4 No central body for quality and cost -efficiency Quality and quality assurance are established by law in the Federal Health Insurance Act. The cantons are in charge of implementation. Even though the legal position is clear, in many cases nobody feels really r esponsible , and o ften the very opposite seems to be the case. Many of those responsible, from hospital directors to doctors, say that quality measurements and controls are much too complicated and bring little besides administrative work. This may be true in certain areas, but there are many quality standards, including international standards, that would enable both compliance and control. This also applies to the broadly available insights into known sources of error which could be minimised with targeted measures. There have long been calls for transparency in quality -related data, but this has not been given priority either. It was only after the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) published its first report on quality indicators in Swiss acute hospit als in 2006 that a broad debate got going on this topic. Even though the FOPH 's approach came in for heavy public criticism, this led many of those responsible to rethink their position. Despite the criticism, some hos- pitals even followed suit and are now also publishing quality data on their websites. Overall the debate has resulted in quality improvements and more transparency at some hospitals. The federal government 's endeavours to coordinate quality and quality assurance are very welcome. Outstanding w ork is being done at various levels on quality and quality assurance - work that should be authoritatively coordinated by a central body, preferably the federal government, and which should be extended across the whole of Switzerland for the benefit of pat ients. The status of patients The status of patients in Switzerland is very poor compared with neighbouring coun- tries. While the bodies representing patients are involved in various working groups run on a federal, cantonal, municipal and private basis, there is no funded, delegated co-determination for patients at the federal level such as exists, for example, in the Netherlands. The rights and duties of patients are set down in various federal and can- tonal laws and ordinances. Canton Zurich, for example, has taken a pioneering role with its own special patient legislation, while the rights and duties of patients in other cantons are generally set down in cantonal healthcare law. While some of these laws regulate these rights and duties very well, patients are in a weak position, partic ularly in liability law, and there is a lack of political will among most parliamentarians to change this state of affairs. When it comes to alleged breaches of duty of care and the resulting health damage, the burden of proof lies with the person affected or their legal representative. This means that in most cases a layperson in medical terms has to substantiate an error and the resulting health damage to a specialist. They also have to bear the costs of investigation themselves, unless they have taken out legal expense insurance. Once the proof has been successfully demonstrated, damages are paid and the case is closed. It is up to the person or institutions responsible alone to take indi- vidual cases further, unless criminal proceedings are instituted - something which in our judgement is necessary only in very rare cases. Experience at the patients ' organ- isations suggests that this is only very rarely the case in real life, especially because 5 errors are supposed to induce a learning effect rather than res ulting in the criminalisa- tion of physicians. While we reject the criminalisation of doctors, we do call for a different approach to handling and processing mistakes that immediately leads to learning effects beyond the individual case. Added to this, the consequences and learning effects derived from errors should be presented transparently so that learning does not simply remain at the individual level. We also call for more quality requirements and controls which are binding across Switzerland and which must eventually involve sanctions. Ultimately , the legal requirements have to be modified in such a way that the burden of proof on those affected is at least reduced. We also call for transparency on matters of quality. A patient must be able to choose a hospital or doctor on the basis of quality criteria. Lack of quality in healthcare Quality and quality assurance in healthcare have top priority, not just because they can save a lot of suffering for patients, but also because they can enable massive cost - savings. But quality assurance in particular has its shortcomings. So far there has been no binding system for the whole of Switzerland for either inpatient or outpatient care. To a large extent quality assurance is done on a voluntary basis. The lack of quality of control is particularly serious. Care providers can give quality the stat us they deem to be appropriate . This can result in exemplary pilot projects and initiatives, but it can also lead to the complete negation of existing shortfalls in quality. There are many reasons for this: a lack of standards, coordination, legal basis, sanctions and insight, but also the fact that shortfalls in quality are not always obvious. Often they only become evi- dent in isolated cases where there are complications in treatment or a potential breach of duty of care. For some time inappropriate care has been the subject of intense de- bate. This is because there have long been question marks in terms of whether only treatments are provided which have a benefit for the patient in question. For this rea- son, there is a growing focus on quality assurance with respect to medical indication. Medical indication as a component of quality assurance also feeds into the number of case statistics, for example in the context of cantonal contracts for hospital services, but also in the context of so- called overtreatment. This term refers to services which are not absolutely necessary, or which are even unnecessary and in our belief better defined in terms of inappropriate care. Medical indication is also closely bound up with the statutory provision of information to patients. Inappropriate care has particularly serious implications for individual patients when a risk taken unnecessarily actually materialises, or when a treatment is carried out without information having been pro- vided to the patient as stipulated by law and the treatment subsequently turns out to be inadequate or even wrong. As research shows, inappropriate care has now as- sumed serious proportions, and this complex problem is intensifying all the time. Econ- omisation and economic interests combined with the lack of binding quality assurance in medical care are key factors in this issue. 6 Quality projects still few and far between For patients to be able to participate in quality assurance they need to be given the relevant tools and knowledge. In the federalist set -up the cantons c annot influence the care provided under basic insurance. If a canton sees a need for action in this respect it can try to bring about reforms by way of a pilot project or by casting its sights beyond the cantonal border. In terms of health literacy, Switzerland is underdeveloped by com- parison with other countries. This prompted the Canton Zurich department of health to join forces with a private institution to launch a health literacy project. Its sponsors include the Zurich patient organisation, which supp orts various projects designed to promote health literacy among members of the public, and patients in particular. Par- ticularly important in this respect is the provision of information to patients by law, in- cluding information in the course of preventive examinations. The DVSP is addressing this issue explicitly. We favour the shared decision- making (SDM) model, which defines the way patients and doctors participate in decisions on further treatment or treatment steps. This form of information and education cannot prevent inappropriate care in individual cases, but it does facilitate holistic treatme nt. The findings of scientific studies on quality assurance are regularly published, but they have not resulted in guidelines that are binding across Switzerland. The Patient Safety Foundation also publishes regular quick alerts and papers of the month, e ach of which highlights a source of error in a particular area and the corresponding measures. In response to our enquiry , a representative of the foundation said that while these pub- lications create lively interest, it is not known - and no effort is made to find out - whether hospital managers, or those involved in general, disseminate these recom- mendations and declare them binding on their establishment, for example by way of directives. The same lack of authoritativeness also prevails when it comes to s tudy findings. Hospital (nosocomial) infection represents a major problem. Experts reckon that around one third of infections could be prevented if hygiene measures were imple- mented systematically and consistently. Various bodies, including the ANQ, conduct measurements of infections. Although there are numerous specialists devoted to hy- giene and measures to reduce rates of infection are known, no comprehensive, binding hygiene standards have been established with corresponding controls and sanctions for non-compliance. This possibly has to do with the fact that the burden of proof that an error was made and resulted in health damage also lies with the patient in the case of hospital infection. These things are difficult to prove, among other things becaus e the FMH expert panel does not issue opinions in the event of infection and there is no hygiene legislation that would require compliance with such an opinion. Neither the findings of the Patient Safety Foundation, the measurements carried out by the ANQ nor the findings of studies have led to comprehensive, binding quality and quality as- surance measures. While this cannot be blamed entirely on the federalist system, it is difficult to coordinate activities if there is no single body in charge. If quality and quality assurance are done inconsistently and only selectively, comparable transparency can- not be established either. But this comparable transparency is crucial. 7 The sovereignty of the cantons The Conference of the Cantonal Ministers of Public Health (GDK) might give the can- tons recommendations in all areas of healthcare, but it does not have the authority to issue directives. Binding inter -cantonal cooperation has to be regulated specially. While this is the case for highly specialised medicine, for which the cantons are also responsible, it does not yet happen across the board. It can also happen that Switzer- land is often too small for rare procedures, treatment of sufficient quality, or for certain studies, which makes it necessary to cooperate internationally in some areas. For qual- ity to be assured in the event of complex interventions, for example, there needs to be a minimum number of cases. This is demonstrated in the quality report accompanying the Federal Office of Public Health' s pilot projec t, and also in a study recently published by University Hospital Zurich. Specialised procedures conducted without the requisite number of cases often result in serious complications and prolonged suffering. This is also one of the reasons why the cantons h ave joined forces in a concordat for the provision of high- end medicine. If this concordat succeeds, high- end medicine will re- main at cantonal level; if not, it will be delegated to the federal level. Different payers The benefits paid under health insurance are the same for the whole population. Eve- ryone is entitled to them regardless of whether they live in a canton with a university hospital or in a small peripheral canton. These services account for around one third of the costs of healthcare. Premiums contribute a share of the costs of healthcare pro- vided under basic insurance. However, premiums do not give direct entitlement to a direct benefit of equal value; not claiming on basic insurance constitutes an act of s ol- idarity with sick people. Premiums cover a reasonable share of the funding required to provide the infrastructure for things like emergency care, training, administration and ultimately also research. This benefits everyone in the event that they need care. With the new hospital planning and funding legislation, in many places acute care has been separated from long -term care. A result of this can be that via the law on the funding of nursing care the responsibility for long -term care now lies primarily with local authorities. The canton, however, is responsible for overseeing home nursing services and long -term care institutions, as well as defining the framework for the funding of long-term care. Responsibilities in this area are thus spread over three levels: federal, cantonal and municipal. This leads to a great deal of non- transparency and legal ine- quality. The implementation of the law on the funding of care also exemplifies the dif- ferent ways in which the cantons exploit their room for manoeuvre. Each canton de- cides for itself who has what responsibi lities. Sometimes it 's the municipalities and sometimes it 's providers who have a say; sometimes there is hybrid responsibility for long-term care. This creates major uncertainty among residents and patients in long - term care institutions as regards the care they are entitled to and, above all, how it is funded. When it comes to funding, legal inequality and uncertainty prevails; amend- ments to the funding law are urgently required to remedy the situation. 8 Progress in medicine Another consideration is the rapid pace of medical progress. While this has undisputed advantages, it also creates the risk that medical care with no proven added value for patients will be covered and paid for under basic insurance. This is because Switzer- land, unlike other countries such as the UK, does not systematically evaluate the value added by highly specialised medicine. In Switzerland there are no structures or institu- tion for doing so. To this end, in 2005 Canton Zurich launched a pilot medical board; it has since gained a new and broader group of sponsors and become established as the Swiss Medical Board. Health technology assessments (HTAs) are used to assess the value added by specific care. The Swis s Medical Board, whose sponsors include the GDK, is now to be developed further or established at federal level in a different form - primarily to ensure that the results and insights gained from the evaluation of care will also impact treatment and funding. If this does not happen , the project will remain on a non -binding, cantonal footing, and potential solutions that would be worth looking into will be put on the shelf. Conclusion The present healthcare system is on the whole very good, but there are clear gaps evident in a number of areas. There is an urgent need for action in many of these areas, especially when it comes to the quality of, for example, medication, invasive procedures, defining indications, identified sources of error, home and in- house nurs- ing interfaces, the benefits of treatment, hygiene, etc. In some of these areas there are already important insights and proven solutions. The federalist structure of the healt hcare system will only work from the patient point of view if powers and responsibilities are newly demarcated in areas such as quality assurance, which should also be coordinated by a single body. Responsibilities in Concrete proposals: Create and establish a centre of quality and cost -efficiency t o guarantee quality assurance across the board Ensure central coordination of quality assurance measures Define binding quality requirements, controls and, when necessary, sanctions Improve transparency of treatment and quality -related data Strengthen int er-cantonal and national cooperation Give patients the right of codetermination at federal level Adopt a different approach to handling and processing mistakes Implement integrated care Adopt measures to prevent inappropriate care, under - and overtreatment Promote public health literacy Define binding standards of hygiene (hygiene legislation) Unify the different funding systems and the different payers 9 highly specialised medicine and the ov ersight of institutions also have to be reorgan- ised. Another proposal is that periods of limitation and forfeit in liability cases should be harmonised across Switzerland. The rights and duties of patients also need to be defined more uniformly to better benefit them. For those affected, the healthcare system is generally lacking in transparency and sub- ject to a great deal of legal inequality. Ultimately, quality and quality assurance are not possible on a nationwide basis. Overall, the federalist structure tends to drive up costs. Few things, apart from the suffering of patients, are as costly as shortcomings in or a lack of quality. The OECD 's healthcare statistics show our system to be more expensive but no better than in comparable countries such as Austria and Canada. Both these countries have fewer consultations and higher life expectancy. The federalist system still has to meet a minimum requirement: it must be anchored in a comprehensive legislative framework for healthcare at the federal level. The most urgent requirement from the point of view of patients: a centr al body for quality and cost -efficiency must be established at the federal level.

Dr. Stuart McLennan Institute for Biomedical Ethics, University of Basel , Switzerland. Date of Submission: 11 January 2019 Disclosure : The author has no conflicts of interests to declare. 2 Abstract While t he need to support patients and staff involved in adverse events has been recognised in Switzerland, there are a number of interconnected barriers and challenges that exist in the Swiss health care system that can undermine support, including variations in hospital safety culture, a lack of systematic programs and staff training, and legal barriers. To improve the support of victims after adverse events in Switzerland, this short report recommends that consideration should be given to the following: Support for patients and families: 1) That the training of staff in relation to \"open disclosure\" is enhanced via the implementation of a broad- based educational initiative and that all Swiss health care organisations establish a core group of \"just -in-time\" disclosure coaches. 2) That there is greater harmonization of open disclosure guidance across Swiss hospitals and that this guidance is made more patient -centred so that patients are asked what their needs are to allow their priorities to guide the disclosure conversation. Support for staff 1) That an evidence- based tool kit is developed to assist Swiss health care organisations in developing and implementing a systematic support program , and that organisations financially invest in these support programs due to both ethical and financial reasons. 2) That the implementation of systematic support programs is combine d with multipronged educational efforts to increase awareness of the problem, the availability of support programs, and that they are beneficial and safe to use. 3 1. Introduction Medical injury has been a central concern to health systems since internati onal research was published highlighting the significant harm that adverse events cause to thousands of patients each year [1]. While efforts to reduce adverse events and harm continue, heath systems are also increasingly considering how the \" victims \" of medical injury can be better supported. 1.1. Support for patients and families The \"first victims \" are the patients who are harmed. Available international data suggests that medical errors cause disabling injuries or death to nearly one in ten patients and that the economic cost of errors is substantial, with prolonged hospitalisation, loss of income, disability and litigation costing some countries many billions of dollars a year [2]. The support of patients and families following an adverse event is inextricably linked to \"open disclosure\" ; the prompt, compassionate, and honest communication with patients and families following a healthcare incident that has resulted in harm [3- 5]. Indeed, t he disclosure of errors has evolved in recent years from a strategic response to rising legal costs focusing on organisational risk minimisation, to an ethical practice seeking to re- establish trus t by meeting patients' needs and expectations following an incident. While the open disclosure process can vary, it typically includes an acknowledgment; providing a factual explanation of what happened; an expression of regret or an apology; an offer of p ractical and emotional support ; and explaining the steps being taken to manage the incident and prevent recurrence [3-4]. Open disclosure is thought to potentially have a number of positive benefits, including assisting the recovery of harmed patients by \"redressing a power imbalance, restoring dignity, achieving closure and stopping the search for an explanation or information, [and] reducing the impulse for redress by making them feel that they have been treated respectfully and fairly\" [6]. Disclosing errors to patients is now widely seen as an ethical, professional and legal duty [3 - 5,7-8]. 1.2. Support for staff The phrase \"second victims\" was introduced in 2000 to highlight the significant emotional impact that staff involved in errors can experience [9], and has been defined as ''a health care provider involved in an unanticipated adverse patient event, medical error and/or a patient related- injury who become victimized in the sense that the provi der is traumatized by the event '' [10 ]. Empi rical evidence suggests that staff involved in major errors, without sufficient support , can experience burn-out, difficulty sleeping, depress ion, flashbacks and self -doubt; harming not only their health but also threatening their ability deliver safe, compassionate care [ 11-14]. It is estimated that between 10.4% to 43.3% are staff are left \"second vi ctims after an adverse event [15]. This has led to a number of organisation al to develop and implement programs to support staff involved in adverse events [16]. Recent cost -benefit analysis of a well -known support program at Johns Hopkins Hospital in the United States, also found that the program has resulted in substantial cost savings (1.8 million dollars) to the hospital via reducing staff turnover and time off [17]. 1.3. Interconnected support Research also suggests that there may be a link between these two issues. Indeed, it appears that this link may go in both directions. N ot only will the adequate support 4 of staff after an error likely assist with open disclosure , but also that positive open disclosure experiences for staff may also mitigate emotional distress associated with future errors [18]. 2. What is known about this topic in the Swiss context? There has been limited research conducted on this topic in Switzerland. While there is anecdotal evidence that a number of hospitals offer support for both types of victims, further research is needed to find out exactly what support is offered. The lack of research has provided challenges in preparing this short report. I n addition to reviewing the literature , I have also contacted a number of individual quality and patient safety managers of Swiss hospitals regarding the support their hospital offers to victims and other key stakeholders in the Swiss health care system . However, the limitations and unrepresentativeness of this information need to be acknowledged. 2.1. Support for patients and families In 2006, t he Swiss Patient Safety Foundation translated the Massachusetts Coalition for the Prevention of Medical Errors' \"When Things Go Wrong\" into German (\"Wenn etwas schief geht\") [5 ], which has been widely distributed and has helped bring awareness to this issue in Switzerland. The Patient Safety Foundation has subsequently also developed a range of education material s and training courses regarding the communic ation of errors to patients [19] . However, previous research indicates that implementation of error disclosure policies by Swiss hospitals has been slow. In 2011, a cross -sectional survey of Swiss hospitals found that 46% of hospitals ( 94/205) had i mplemented 16% (33/205) were planning to impl next 12 months; and 38% (78/205 ) had not implemented a disclosure standard and were not planning to do so [20]. However, the fact that open disclosure policies were implemented across cultures and languages in Switzerland, a country with an emphasis on decentralisation, is a promising sign and shows that moves towards more transparency and open communication with patients are being recognised as universally needed. This survey , however, did not examine the contents of these policies, and I am not aware of any previous research examining the details of the practical and emotional support that Swiss hospitals currently provide patients and families after an adverse event. However, the policies I have reviewed and the feedback I have received suggests that: 1) While a number of Swiss hospitals now have policies acknowledging the importance of communicating with and supporting patients and families after an adverse event , most of these policies do not have the necessary detail and granularity to provide sufficient guidance about how to do this in practice; 2) Due to the possibility of a liability case, complaints management and legal departments are often the initial contact point for patients and families following an adverse event. In 2012/2013, a cross- sectional survey was conducted with clinically active anaesthesiologists regarding communicating medical errors [21]. This study found, among other things, that only 12% of respondents had received any training on how to disclose errors to patients. Although, 93% were interested in receiving general 5 training on how to disclose errors to patients, and 95% were interested in receiving support from an expert on patient communication after a serious error [20]. Significant differences were also found between departments regarding error disclosure, likely reflecting leadership and the prevailing ethos of the individual department and hospital [21 ]. 2.2. Support for staff The Swiss Patient Safety Foundation was the first organization to systematically exami ne the issue of \"second victims \" in Europe, [ 22-23], It has also published a comprehensive document entitled \" T\u00e4ter als Opfer\" (Offender as victim) in 2010 , which provides a comprehensive overview of the topic and recommendations regarding what managers, colleagues and victims should know and do following an adverse event [ 24]. At present, there has been no research published regarding the exact support that Swiss hospitals provide to staff after an adverse event. However, t here is currently a survey being conducted to assess this by PD Dr. Rene Schwendimann from the University Hospital Basel and Prof. David Schwappach from the Swiss Patient Safety Foundation. Nevertheless, t he policies I have reviewed and feedback I have received suggests that while there are a few hospitals that have more developed support policies and procedures in place, most Swiss hospitals do not have formal support programs and support is provided inconsistently and on an ad hoc basis. Outside of hospitals, the Swiss Medical Association (FMH) also offers support to physicians via the ReMed support network [25 ]. ReMed provides support to physicians in crisis via its 24-hour hotline and team of experienced counsellors, and preventive services through workshops and training courses [25]. The cross- sectional survey conducted with Swiss anaesthesiologists in 2012/2013, also examined the emotional impact of medical errors [26]. The study found, among other things, that 1) 90% of participants disagreed that hospitals adequately support them in coping with the stress associated with medical errors (30% strongly) , and 2) 92% reported that they were interested in psychological counselling after a serious error, but identified a number of barriers to seeking psychological counselling . 3. What are the barriers and challenges that exist in Swiss Healthcare regarding this topic ? There appears to be a number of interconnected barriers and challenges that exist in the Swiss health care system that can undermine the support of both types of victims . 3.1. Cultural Norms The importance of creating a cul ture of safety in health care has been repeatedly noted in the q uality and safety literature [27 ]. The most frequently cited dimensions of safety culture include: \" leadership commitment to safety; open communication founded on trust; organisational learning; a non- punitive approach to adverse event reporting and analysis; teamwork; and shared belief in the importance of safety \" [27]. Unfortunately, the medical profession has \"traditionally relied upon that method found most unhelpful in reducing errors and improving quality \u2014namely, shame and blame of individuals with accusations of incompetence, unprofessionalism, and unworthiness to treat patients...\" [28]. This \"blame culture\" is at odds wit h the 6 contemporary \"systems\" conception of error causation, which holds that most errors have their roots in wider organisational factors [29], and is unlikely to foster an environment where staff feel they can safely discuss medical errors openly and seek help for themselves . While t he importance of a good safety culture has been recognised in Switzerland, a number of stakeholders report that cultural norms towards medical error can still act as a n important barrier to the support of victims . International research on general patient safety culture has found that organisational culture significantly varies between hospitals [30]. The limited research conducted in Switzerland also indicates that the cultural norms of individual hospitals and departments may be a key barrier or facilitator to the support of victims [20-21,26 ]. 3.2. Policies and Training The implementation of systematic policies and procedures may be an important indication of organisational culture concerning the support of victims . International research has also found that the implementation of systematic policies and procedures, along with the increase of specially trained staff, has been one of the driving forces behind the improved support of both types of victims [1 6,31]. Thus, the fact many Swiss hospitals do not appear to have such systematic policies and procedures regarding supporting victims , and that many staff have not received training of this issue, is potentially very concerning and an important barrier . Furthermore , in the absence of systematic policies and procedures there can also be a lack of clear responsibilities in relation to supporting victims, which some stakeholders report to be a current issue . 3.3 Legal Legal fears of staff have been identified internationally as one of the most pervasive barriers in dealing with medical errors [32-33]. Although the focus on the law is often misguided [32-34], previous stakeholder interviews in Switzerland have highlight ed some potentially important legal barriers to supporting victims [37-38]: 1) Criminal liability: Switzerland currently has the threshold for criminal liability set very low, with any negligent act that results in bodily injury a potential candidate for a criminal investigation [37]. While the current incidence of criminal cases regarding patient harm may be reasonably low, criminal prosecutions can have a significant negative impact on clinicians, often destroying their professional lives and reputations a nd having a significant impact on their personal lives and health, even though they do not result in a conviction. Fear around criminal liability, can, therefore, not only act as a barrier to supporting patients by making staff less willing to be open about medical errors, a criminal investigation can also further victimize the staff involved. 2) Liability insurance: Current practice of at least some liability insurance companies in Switzerland is currently inhibiting communication with harmed patients after a n error [38]. Indeed, it appears that all communication with the patient is often stopped once a claim i s made due to instructions given by insurance companies' lawyers, or hospitals and staff being overly cautious. Staff are particularly concerned about losing their liability insurance cover for apologising to harmed patients. This situation is likely to act as a barrier to providing support to patients and families after a medical error. 7 4. What are your recommendations for improvements in these areas? This short report has highlighted how the support of patients, families and staff are not separate issues, but closely interconnected. As such, it would be preferable that the recommendations for improvements outlined below are implemented in a common , integrated, approach to supporting victims . 4.1. Support for patients and families Disclosing and apologizing for an adverse event , is one of the most complex and difficult conversations that occur in healthcare [35 ]. It is r ecommended that enhancing the training and support of staf f in relation to this process will likely make the biggest difference i n the support of patients and families in Switzerland. Recommendation 1: Training 1) A broad- based educational initiative: Given the number of staff who at any time could become involved in an adverse event, it is important that all staff have a general understanding of open disclosure [3 9]. While the work of the Swiss Patient Safety Foundation has done much to address this i ssue, there is still a need to improve the general disclosure training of undergraduates and postgraduates, and for all staff to understand their organisation's approach to open disclosure. 2) Coaching expertise: It is, however, unrealistic that general education will enable all staff to be able to hold these discussions well and any moment [39]. Nevertheless, previous research has clearly established that patients want to be having these discussions with their physicians and not with risk managers or other institutional representatives [39 ]. It is therefore recommended that all Swiss health care organisations establish a core group of \"just -in-time\" disclosure coaches who are available to guide staff in how to have these discussions with patients and families well [3 9]. Recommendation 2 : Guidance 1) Harmonising guidance: There is currently significant unwarranted heterogeneity in open disclosure policies in Switzerland, which needs to be addressed. It is concerning that less than 50% of Swiss hospitals have implemented an open disclosure policy, and the policies that have been implemented often do not contain the necessary granularity to provide staff with specific guidance. Without sufficient guidance, it will be difficult for many staff to meet patients' expectations and needs. In many instances, health care policies should be context specific; the needs of a large university hospital will often be very different from a small rural hospital. However, in the context of open disclosure, there arguably should not be as much variation in the scope and contents of policies as current ly seen and t here is a need for greater harmonization across Swiss hospitals. It is recommended that key stakeholders come together to agree on a common approach to open disclosure guidance that not only provides sufficient detail and granularity for staff but also better meets the needs of consumers. A nation -wide open disclosure policy, similar to the Australian Open Disclosure Framework [40], may be a better approach, rather than requiring every hospital in Switzerland to reinvent the wheel, resulting in multiple individual policies with significant unwarranted variations. However , the experience of the United Kingdom in implementing a 2005 national policy highlights the importance of engaging and supporting sta ff to implement such a policy [41]. 8 2) Making the open disclosure process more patient -centred: Whatever approach is used to harmonise open disclosure guidance, this guidance should take into consideration the findings of r ecent international research that has indicated how the open disclosure process could better support patients and families . This research suggests that there is a need to: 1) ask, and not assume, what patients and families need; and 2) provide injured patients with the opportunity to \"be heard\"; allowing their priorities to lead the conversation rather than just listening to the patient's answers to ques tions posed by staff [4 2-43]. 4.2. Support for staff There is a clear need for Swiss health care organisations to provide more consistent and timely support to staff involved medical errors. It is recommended that assisting health care organisations to develop systematic support programs and implementing multipronged educational initiatives will likely make the biggest difference in the support of staff in Switzerland. Recommendation 1: Systematic support programs 1) Evidence -based tool kit : There is a need for Swiss health care organisations to implement more systematic support programs. It has been suggested, however, that \"one of the reasons that health care organisations do not routinely offer emotional support might be that their leaders do not know how to develop and successfully implement a support system\" [44 ]. Indeed, it has been found that in the absence of another structure to imitate, that it can take many years to develop and implement a support process [4 5]. While the Swiss Patient Safety Foundation has provided comprehensive recommendations regarding what health care managers should know and do following an adverse event [24 ], there is a need for more detailed guidance to assist Swiss health care organisations to practically develop and implement support programs. Consideration should be given to developing an evidence- based tool kit to assist Swiss healthcare organisations in developing and implementing a systematic support program , similar to tool kits developed in the United States [4 6]. Staff often \"suffer in silence\" following a medical error as they are not offered (nor seek out) the support that they need [47 ]. Given the post -event trajectory that has been identified, support programs could be developed to screen at-risk staff after an adverse event and proactively offer support to \" expedite recovery and mitigate adverse career outcomes\" [48 ]. Finally, support programs should reflect on the terminology used to describe the staff involved in adverse events and the servic es to support them. Although the term \"second victim\" is now widely used, there is some controversy over use of the term ; with concerns that the term \"victim\" may stigmatize staff and offend patient advocates [49 ]. While the use of \"second victims\" may still be helpful in some contexts, it has been suggested that \"[f]or support programs that appeal directly to health care workers, different language may attract more users [49]. 2) Funding of programs : Although supporting staff after adverse events is clearly the right thing to do ethically, the cost -benefit analysis of Johns Hopkins Hospital's support program indicates that the implementation of such support programs is also in the financial interests of health care organisations [17]. Swiss health car e organisations should, therefore, give serious consideration to investing in support programs due to both ethical and financial reasons. 9 Recommendation 2: Multipronged e ducational initiatives One of the biggest challenges of support programs internationally has been getting staff who could benefit from them to actually use them [16 ]. Contact with quality and patient safety managers of Swiss hospitals suggests that this is also a challenge in Switzerland. Furthermore, a recent qualitative metasynthesis of the literature indicate that hospital safety culture plays a key role in the support of staff [50]. It is therefore recommended that the implementation of systematic support programs is combined with multipronged educational efforts to increase awareness of the problem, the availability of support programs , and that they are beneficial and safe to use. 10 References 1.

[Epub ahead of print] REGULATION SYSTEM AND QUALITY / SAFETY Contribution to the Swiss national report on quality and safety in the healthcare system Professor Olivier Guillod Director, Institute of Health Law Rachel Christinat, Doctor of Law Senior Lecturer, Institute of Health Law University of Neuch\u00e2tel January 2019 2 The authors confirm that they are not under any conflict of interest. Abstract National -level players in the healthcare field are not subject to any special regulations governing the safety and quality of the care that is provided. As far as we are aware, Valais is the only canton to have adopted specific provisions in its health legislation. Numerous federal and cantonal laws therefore contain articles that indirectly address patient safety and quality of care. The fragmented nature of the subject makes a legal analysis complicated, and implementation is left to various public bodies at national (Federal Council) and cantonal (cantonal public health authorities) level on the one hand, and private institutions (such as the Swiss Foundation for Patient Safety, patient advocacy organisations or even healthcare facilities) on t he other. Furthermore, the medical liability system in place in Switzerland is poorly equipped to manage clinical risks, despite the case law of the Federal Supreme Court having resulted in various amendments to the relevant legal provisions. Moreover, wit h the exception of the Canton of Valais, healthcare providers are under no legal obligation to operate a Critical Incident Reporting System (CIRS) for adverse events that occur in the course of the treatment they provide. In our opinion, promoting safety and quality in healthcare would entail reforming the current liability system and introducing a legal obligation to report adverse events to an independent state organisation in such a way that both contribute to the establishment of a \"learning from mistak es\" culture among healthcare professionals. 3 Developments 1. What do we know about the subject in the Swiss context (brief summary)? Baume recently carried out a particularly thorough survey of the subject1. As a result, this report is quite largely based on his report, and summarises its main findings. At present, there is no national legal basis directly governing the safety of medical treatment and quality of care in themselves, nor, with the exception of general training requirements, are healthcare pr ofessionals and healthcare facilities subject to any universal system that aims to improve these two elements of medical delivery. Ensuring patient safety and quality of care is essentially the task of the Cantons2. In this case, Valais is the only canton to have enacted legislation to set up a cantonal patient safety and care quality committee ( commission cantonale pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des patients et la qualit\u00e9 des soins , or CSPQS). This committee is tasked with developing and introducing both a strategy for and the tools needed to evaluate and manage patient safety and quality of care (Art. 42 LS/VS3). Moreover, the legislation requires everyone who works in a healthcare facility to report any incident. In return, reporters and staff members who were involved in the incident are granted immunity from disciplinary action (Art. 44 LS/VS). The database containing these reports is used solely for incident -prevention and training purposes. It sets out proposed or actual measures to prevent a repetition of the incidents (Art. 47 LS/VS). Finally, the law gives the Health Department4 authority to extend the system to outpatient care providers if the CSPQS proposes doing so, and after consultation with the healthcare professions concerned (Art. 48 LS/VS). The majority of the other Cantons make provision for patient safety or quality of care in the context of granting or withdrawing licences to practice a medical profession or operate a healthcare facility5, granting relief6, assigning public functions or even ordering e mergency measures7. Some Cantons' health legislation does not directly mention safety8, but all have adopted provisions governing patient rights, something that guarantees a certain safety threshold in clinical care delivery.9 Moreover, safety is linked to quality of care, and all Cantons impose conditions intended to guarantee a certain quality level on facilities, such as implementing a quality assurance system10. Under the \"SwissDRG\" system of financing hospital care by mandatory health insurance (Federal Health Insurance Act, HIA), the Cantons designate public or private hospitals that are 1 2015, 573 pages. 2 Baume, note 1 , 255 ff. 3 Loi valaisanne sur la sant\u00e9 [Valais health act] of 14 February 2008 (classified compilation [hereafter: RS]/VS 800.1). 4 In full the Department of Health, Soc ial Affairs and Culture. 5 For examples see Art. 79 para. 2 of the Neuch\u00e2tel health act of 6 February 1995 (RS/NE 800.1) and Art. 24 para. 1 of the Jura act on hospitals of 28 June 2011 (RS/JU 810.11). 6 In particular see para. 15 of Basel's ordinance on healthcare professionals and facilities of 6 December 1978 (RS/BS 310.120). 7 For an example, refer to Art. 23 para. 1 of the Vaud act on the planning and financing of public health facilities of 5 December 1978 (RS/VD 810.01). 8 Baume, note 1 , N 261. 9 Baume, note 1 , N 259. 10 Baume, note 1 , N 259 and 296. 4 permitted to provide services that are reimbursed by basic health insurance cover and cantonal funding. This list of hospitals is based primarily on quality criteria11. Under Article 39 para. 2b HIA, the Cantons are also required to work together on nationwide planning for highly specialised services (hereafter HSS). In the light of this, the Cantons have adopted the inter - cantonal convention on HSS, one of the primary goals of which is to safeguard the quality of these complex and expensive treatments, for which extensive technical knowledge and high levels of staff and equipment resources are required12. Quality of care is an integral part of the quality system, and manag ing clinical risk is an important constituent. Baume states that \" this notion stems from the conviction ... that the search for errors should not end with individual blame, but extend to organisational dysfunction and the system in which care is provided\".13 The main area in which federal law has an effect on evaluations of the quality of medical care is mandatory health insurance, where Article 58 HIA prescribes a quality assurance system14. Under this provision, the quality of the services provided by mandatory health insurers can be inspected for the purpose of ensuring that the best care is delivered at the lowest possible cost. The health insurers also verify quality in two ways. Firstly, the tariff agreements they sign with listed hospitals (Art. 46 HIA) frequently describe the precise measures that service providers have to implement to guarantee quality of care. Secondly, they verify that service providers comply with the measures set in place to assure quality of care. Federal laws on other specific subjects also contain provisions governing quality of care, either by defining the criteria that people authorised to administer certain treatments have to fulfil or to guarantee the quality of analytical tests, products or procedures15. By harmonising the tr aining and eligibility conditions for a number of healthcare professions, the federal government was also endeavouring to ensure that practitioners possess a high level of skills and are thus able to administer high -quality care16. Quality indicators for Sw iss acute -care hospitals (hereafter CH -IQI17) have been in place since 2008 to evaluate inpatient care. They give the public a summary of the services provided by the hospitals, which are funded mainly by social insurance premiums and taxes. The indicators thus facilitate comparisons of healthcare facilities and feed into discussions of quality18. 11 Baume, note 1 , N 269 ff. note , N 299 ff. 13 Baume, note 1 , N 266. 14 Federal Act of 18 March 1994 on Health Insurance (HIA; RS 832.10) . 15 In particular, see Articles 9 and 10 of the Federal Act of 18 December 1998 on Medically Assisted Reproduction (RS 810.11); 8 and 13 of the Federal Act of 8 October 2004 on Human Genetic Testing (RS 810.12); 6 of the Radiological Protection Act of 22 March 1991 (RS 814.50); and 10 of the Federal Act of 30 September 2011 on Research involving Human Beings (RS 810.30). 16 Applies to doctors, dentists, pharmacists, vets and chiropractors (see the Federal Act of 23 June 2006 on University Courses for Medical Professions [RS 811.11]), the psychology professions (see the Federal Act of 18 March 2011 on the Psychology Professions 2011 [ RS 935.81]), and nurses, physiotherapists,occupational therapists, midwives, dieticians, optometrists and osteopaths (see the Federal Act of 30 September 2016 on Healthcare Occupations [this Act is scheduled to come into force in 2020; Federal Gazette 2016, p. 7383 ff]). 17 Abbreviation of December 2018). 5 However, it must be emphasised that the CH -IQI \"are not indicative of structural or process quality, nor of other aspects of results quality, such as infection or patient satisfaction levels \"19. 2. What significant and pertinent changes have occurred in the Swiss healthcare system? Legal experts have been working on the issue of quality and safety of care for nearly forty years now, but they have focused mainly on professional liability20. The issue has grown in importance since the start of the 21st century in particular21. Even though a number of authors have put forward suggestions, no significant changes have been made to federal law. However, the mandatory health insurance scheme operated under the HIA has progressively paid greater attention to quality of care and patient safety, particularly in connection with the new financing system for hospital care. A professional liability system based on individual blame i s not conducive to the evolution of a culture of learning from mistakes. The Federal Supreme Court (FSC) has made two liability law rulings that benefit patients who have suffered damage as a result of medical treatment. First the FSC has distanced itself from the normal principle that liability is based on a breach of the duty to exercise due care such that healthcare professionals bear a greater portion of the risk inherent in any medical treatment22. Accordingly, it has decided that \" the risk involved in any medical action, which is normally borne by the patient, passes to the practitioner if he proceeds without obtaining the informed consent that he could or should have obtained \"23. Since then, the FSC has produced a body of case law concerning the amount of risk -related information to be given to patients, which is dependent on the seriousness and frequency of the risk in question24. In a 1994 ruling, the FSC lightened the burden of proof on patients to demonstrate that the rules of medical practice had been breached when it made doctor error a presumed fact in a case where a patient had developed an infection at the site of an injection of a medicinal product25. Secondly, the FSC recognised that healthcare institutions have a responsibility if no other or ganisation is in place26. Under this case law, facilities are obliged by the hospitalisation contract to take the measures needed to guarantee patients' safety while they are in hospital27. 3. What obstacles and challenges have to be faced? From a legal perspe ctive, the first difficulty is the lack of harmonised national regulations on the management of clinical risk and quality in the healthcare sector28. With the exception of 19 Baume, note 1 , N 277. 20 aux soins et and new technologies] (eds. Rigaud- Bully/Auray), Paris 2002, p. 123, notes 43 and 44. 21 Guillod, note 20 0, p. 113. 22 Guillod, note 21 0, p. 117. 23 DTF 108 II 59 c. 3. 24 Baume, note 1 , N 228 ff. 25 DTF 120 II 248 c. 2. 26 DTF 130 I 337 ; 123 III 204 ; 120 Ib 411 ; 112 Ib 322. 27 and insurance 2018], p. 115 ff. 28 Baume, note 1 , N 243 ff. 6 the legislation in force in the Canton of Valais, therefore, regulation exists only i n fragmented form in various federal and cantonal laws. This has resulted in a partial blurring of the extent of healthcare professionals' obligations, notably the obligation to inform patients of any mistakes that may have been made, and the obligation to report to an independent body adverse events during medical treatment. Patient safety and quality of care are not the responsibility of a single independent organisation tasked not only with overseeing but also collecting data that can subsequently be used to issue directives to care providers as a way of improving patient care. This is a second hurdle. The sheer diversity of the applicable legislation splits jurisdiction between the national and cantonal author ities. Thus, for example, the Federal Council is responsible for assuring the quality of care funded by mandatory health insurance (Art. 58 HIA), whereas the cantonal health authorities review the quality of care provided by healthcare professionals and hospitals. Finally, certain Cantons require healthcare institutions themselves to set up quality assurance systems. The large number of stakeholders complicates analysis and makes it hard to compile a global view of the situation. A third complicating factor stems from the existence of numerous \"soft law\"29 provisions with no direct force. This factor affects not only private healthcare organisations and healthcare institutions, but also public authorities30. The final obstacle is the inadequacy of the Swiss medical liability system. Liability governs the conditions under which someone who suffers injury as a result of a medical act can obtain financial compensation from the healthcare professional responsible for the injury. Here, three conditions must be met: the professional must have failed to exercise due care by breaching the rules of medical practice or the obligation to inform patients; the patient must have suffered physical or moral injury; and the inj ury must be causally linked to the professional's breach of care. While liability law exists primarily to make reparation (to restore the patient to a financial situation that he would have enjoyed had the injury not occurred), it also has a preventive function (to make the responsible party feel the cost of negligent behaviour and by so doing prevent a repetition)31. However, three factors largely diminish the preventive function of civil liability (and its contribution to patient safety)32. Firstly, healthc are facilities and doctors who practice under their own professional responsibility generally have liability insurance that covers them for the financial cost of liability. Secondly, the process of determining liability provides no systematic guarantee of identifying cases where a healthcare professional has actually breached his duty to exercise due care and caused a patient injury. Finally, the liability system has the perverse side effect of encouraging the healthcare professionals who may potentially be responsible to conceal any behaviour that might be construed as wrongful. In the light of these findings, one of the authors of this report wrote as long ago as 2002 that \"applied to medical care, a liability system based on personal blame - attributable either to the responsible person himself or to one of his assistants - has largely become inadequate if there is a genuine intention to encourage high -quality care and respond to concerns about fairness \"33. 29 These are rules that do not have legal force but influence the behaviour of a group of people. The people affected sometimes construe them as being \"as good as binding\". 30 For further details, refer to Baume, note 1 , N 357 ff. 31 Guillod, note 21 , p. 114. 32 Guillod note 21 , p. 115 ff. 33 Guillod, note 21 , p. 114. 7 Finally, it must be stated that the current liabil ity system does not recognise therapeutic risks that arise independently of any error by a healthcare professional (for example nosocomial infections or patients presenting with complications). 4. What action do you recommend? Our proposal consists in essence of two modifications. Firstly, healthcare professionals should be under a legal obligation to spontaneously communicate any adverse event that occurs during medical care (the nature of the procedure - diagnostic, therapeuti c, aesthetic or palliative - is of little relevance). This would make it possible to systematise and standardise adverse event reporting independently of error by a healthcare professional. Reports should be sent to an ad hoc centralised body, which would count and analyse them for the purpose of issuing directives to prevent risky or inappropriate acts. Given the current medical liability system, adverse event reporting should be subject to total immunity to prevent lawyers using reports in proceedings against healthcare professionals or healthcare facilities. The second proposal involves changing the medical liability system by shifting its basis from personal blame to objective responsibility - say risk -based or, better still, compensation -based, as in B elgium, France or New Zealand. This change would remove any legal incentive to conceal errors. Professional malpractice could possibly be retained as a prior condition of legal action.

Introduction According to the World Health Organization (WHO) a patient's chan ce of being harmed whilst re- ceiving healthcare is 1 in 300. Harm can be caused by a range of incidents or adverse events (AE), with nearly 50% of them being preventable. AEs include adverse drug events (ADEs), health care associated infections (HAI), venous thromboembolisms (VTEs), falls and pressure ulcers . But harm is also caused by diagnostic errors, surgical complications and administrative errors, such as lost to follow up (1). Harm to patients occurs in the hospital as well as in the primary and ambulatory care setting. The OECD report 2017 'The economics of patient safety ' states patient harm as the 14th leading cause of global disease burden, comparable to tuberculosis, malaria and some types of cancer. The OECD further reports on its website that on average, 1 in 10 hospitalizations results in safety fail- ure or AEs and that as many as 4 out of 10 patients experience safety issues in primary and ambu- latory care settings. In addition to the social burden of patient harm , AEs cause considerable finan- cial costs. Available evidence shows that up to 1 5% of total hospital activity and expendi ture is a direct result of AEs in OECD countries (2,3). Since the publication of the national report 'To err is human : building a safer healthcare system ' of the Institute of Medicine in 2000 national health services, governments and researchers worldwide have begun to take action in respect of measuring the extent of harm in their health care system s (4). The methods used include incident reporting, medical record review, observational and ethno- graphic studies, patient experience surveys, routine collection of safety metrics and automated data extraction from electronic medical records (5) . In Switzerland, a systematic data collection on patient harms is lacking. Since there is no national obligation to report on harm to patients the exact size of the problem is currently unknown. Data are collected in various places such as hospitals, liability insurers, cantonal physicians or patient protection organisations. However, t he reason data are collected for varies and a standa rd list of harms is often missing. Due to the specific objective of the data collection some cases might be accounted twice whereas others are not reported at all. To make matters worse, the data are not openly accessible and are hardly ever published. According to t he lack of systematically collected data the extent of patient harm in the Swiss healthcare system is usually extrapolated. Applying the OECD figures from 2017 to the Swiss con- text in 2016 a median of 10% of patients is affected by at least one adverse event during hospitali- sation, resulting in more than 100 000 patients annually experiencing at least one unintended inju- ry or complication associated with hospital care (2,6). A few organisations - which provide their own contribution to the Swiss National Report on Quality and Safety in Healthcare - do systematically collect data on patient harm . As a general rule the data collection is restricted to certain clinical topics . For exam ple, a standardized nationwide data collection on falls, decubitus, surgical site infections as well as potential ly avoidable rehospitali sa- tions and reoperation is provided by the Swiss Association for Quality Development in Hospitals and Clinics (ANQ). The ANQ analyses the data collected by hospitals and clinics from acute care, rehabilitation and psychiatry in a nationwide comparable manner and publishes it annually . Healthcare associated infections (HAI) - commonly considered preventable adverse events - are reported by Swissnoso, the national association of leading professionals in the fields of infectious diseases and infection prevention. In 2017, Swissnoso and the University Hospital of Geneva lead a point prevalence survey on HAIs and the use of anti microbials in almost hundred acute care hospitals (7). This was the second survey on HAI in Switzerland after 2004. Although the two sur- veys differ in methodology they draw a picture on the burden of patient harm caused by nosocomi- al infections in Switzerland and allow benchmarking with other countries in Europe. Yet a nother Harm to patients in Switzerland \u00a9Swiss Patient Safety Foundation page 4 example provides the collection of claims data in anaesthesia by the Swiss Society of Anaesthesi- ology and Resuscitation (SSAR) (see also section 3.2 of this report) . In contrast, r eporting and learning systems such as the Critical Incident Reporting System (CIRS) are often erroneously believed to provide information on patient harm. A s described in the \"Incident reporting and s afety learning\" report - another contribution from the Swiss Patient Safety Founda- tion to the Swiss National Report on Quality and Safety in Healthcare - CIRS are not the right tool for collecting data on patient harm and should not be (mis)used as such. To address the topic of patient harm in Switzerland we decided to choose an approach by method- ology relying on data published in peer -reviewed journals be tween 2000/01/01 and 2018/10/30, focusing on preventable adverse events as a surrogate marker for pati ent harm. 2. Methodologies applied in Switzerland 2.1 Chart reviews Retrospective chart reviews, also known as medical record reviews, are commonly used to meas- ure the prevalence of AE s (8). The most frequently used review methods are the \"Harvard Method\" and the Institute of Healthcare Improvement's Global Trigger Tool (see also Global Trigger Tool, section 3.1 of this report ) (9,10) . Although numerous studies have been published worldwide, data for Switzerland are rare . To our knowledge the study by Halfon and colleagues published in 2017 is the only retrospective chart review determining the incidence of AE s carried out in Switzerland (11). By performing a two steps retrospective chart review in one acute care hospital the authors found an overall hospital incidence rate of AEs of 14.1%. The proportion of hospitalizations with at least one AE was 12.3%. Almost half of all AEs were judged preventable. Whereas 60% of AEs lead to no or minor disability, 23 % of AEs resulted in severe impairment . Interestingly, none of the AEs resulted in death. This result contrasts international finding s that estimate around 7% of AE s being lethal. However, the main limitations are that t he study was conducted in only one medium size community hospital and data are from medical records dating from one single year (2008). 2.2 Surveys Survey studies that involve healthcare professionals or patients are another useful source to as- sess information on the frequency and severity of patient harm in healthcare. In contrast to medical chart reviews which rely on complete and correct patient documentation survey studies provide a methodology to assess the entire range of safety events occurring during patient care. In the last few years, a couple of surveys have been published for Switzerland. Some of them took place in primary care, aiming at gaining additional insights i nto the hot spots of patient safety. Gehring and colleagues assessed the frequency and harm associated with primary care safety incidents by sur- veying primary care physicians and nurses about the occurrence of safety problems in their offices (12). Out of 316 physicians almost one third rep orted that at least one of the described incidents occurred daily or weekly in their offices. In the group of nurses it was one in six. Over the course of one year, each responder counted on average a total of 92 incidents. The incidents most frequent- ly reported occurred in the following areas 1) documentation, 2) information from external provider and 3) medication. In general, the frequency of reported incidents was considerably higher for phy- sicians than for nurses. Some events, however, nurses noticed m ore often than physicians sup- porting the involvement of both, physicians and nurses, into patient safety activities. The authors also found differences in the reporting frequencies between the different types of medical office organisation. In medical cent res physicians and nurses reported higher frequencies of incidents than in single- handed and joint offices . This finding most likely reflects the higher case load and number of staff employed in such medical centres. Harm to patients in Switzerland \u00a9Swiss Patient Safety Foundation page 5 Survey studies of self -reported patient s' safety events and perceptions of safety provide another method to gain information on preventable adverse events that are not reported in the medical rec- ord. For example in the survey study of Schwappach and colleagues 21.4% of patients reported to have experienced at least one definite event, and 29.1% reported at least one definite or possible event (13). The results of the pat ient survey were reported back to the hospitals which allowed them to initiate a discussion of safety issues within their organi sation. Another study addressed patients' experiences of drug administration safety in the oncology setting and investigated the relationship between perceptions of risk and potential harm, staff safety practices, and patients' engagement in error prevention strategies (14). The authors found that 16% of patients reported having experienced an error in their cancer care, and 11% were currently very concerned about errors. Surprisingly, patients rated the potential harm for drug overdosing rather low. This finding is rather unexpected and points out the necessity to improve communication about safety issues be- tween care provider and patient. Patient safety surveys of the experience of medical errors have also been conducted in a multinational setting (15) . For Switzerland the frequency of self-reported errors was 11.9%. Taken together , survey studies have been shown to report AEs in hospitals and in the outpatient setting. The frequency of self -reported AEs is in line with the above noted ratio of 1 out of 10 pa- tients being harmed during medical care. In addition, survey studies offer the possibility to tackle patient safety issues from a different perspective thereby helping risk managers and healthcare providers to guide their quality improvement activities. 2.3 Autopsies Autopsies have long been considered the gold standard for detecting diagnostic errors. Diagnostic errors are usually more common than expected and remain often undetected while the patient is alive. Major diagnostic errors have an impact on patients' survival in that knowledge of the correct diagnosis would have changed treatment. Diagnostic performance can be monitored by comparing medical reports with autopsy reports. Several retrospective analyses have been published showing that the diagnostic error rate in Swiss hospitals is rather low. For a primary referral hospital Thurn- heer and colleagues found cardiovascular diseases being misdiagnosed in 18.7%, followed by infectious diseases in 12.9%, oncological diseases in 3.6% and neurological diseases in 1.8% (16) . Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity improved from 67% in 1997 to 87% in 2009 and from 94% to 99% in 2009, respectively. As the authors noted , diagnostic accuracy went along with the availabil- ity of highly sensitive laboratory markers and rapid imaging techniques. A reduction in major diag- nostic errors over time was also seen at a large tertiary teaching hospital resulting in 7% i n 2002 (17). Diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity and specificity rose for all studied diseases (cardiovascular, infectious and neoplastic diseases). Another study, analysing the rate of diagnostic errors in neo- nates and paediatric intensive care patients from 2004 to 2013 found 6% major diagnostic errors (18). Despite the relatively low numbers of diagnostic errors found in Swiss hospitals , the problem of missing, wrong or delayed diagnosis does nevertheless ex ist and might cause major harm to pa- tients. The extent of the problem might be even higher as autopsy rates are steadily declining and alternative methods to detect and measure diagnostic errors are not established yet. 3. Methodologies underused in Switzerland Further methodologies such as the global trigger tool, claims data and patient safety indicators from routine data are important sourc es of finding information on AE s. However, published data for Switzerland hardly exist. We found the following informat ion: Harm to patients in Switzerland \u00a9Swiss Patient Safety Foundation page 6 3.1 Global trigger tool The global trigger tool (GTT) has been established in 2003 by the Institute of Healthcare Improve- ment (IHI) to detect AEs through a two- stage retrospective medical record review. To collect data in review stage 1 two independent reviewers (e.g. nurse, physician) screen the medical record for the presence of triggers indicating patient harm. In stage 2 the findings are discus sed within the team. The review is performed regularly on a random small sample of medical charts and provides data on the frequency and types of AEs. The method has been demonstrated to be effective and has become widely used to monitor AE rates at the ho spital level. However, as to our knowledge, while the GTT has been applied in Switzerland, no data on the frequency of AEs in Swiss hospitals measured by the GTT have been published so far. The Department of Public Health by the Univer- sity of Basel is curr ently performing a multicent re study with the aim to measure AE s in adult care settings by using the GTT (https://nursing.unibas.ch/de/forschungsprojekte/forschung/forschung/gttkaim/ ; retrieved January 2019) . 3.2 Claims data Claims data might be another valuable source of information on harm to patient s. However, they are rarely accessible as they are often associated with legal proceedings. Healthcare providers themselves, patient protection organisations and the Swiss Medical Association possess infor- mation on claims data. To our knowledge, the Swiss Society of Anaesthesiology and Reanimation (SSAR) is the only medical organisation that analyses and publishes claims data in order to learn from it and to formu- late recommendations to their members. In the late 1990, the SSAR initiated a commission to sys- tematically analy se closed malpractice claims. Records of closed claims are provided by currently three out of four professional medical liability insurance companies in Switzerland and the Office for Extrajudicial Expert Review of the Swiss Medical Associ ation. In a retrospective study covering the period 1987- 2008 the commission found 171 events leading to anaesthesia- related injuries (19). More than half of the claims were related to regional anaesthesia whereas 28% of injuries were allocated to general anaesthesia. Other anaesthesia related -procedures accounted for 18% of reported injuries. The injuries were lethal in 12% of cases and lead to permanent harm in 63% of patients. The commission also judged the quality of care and found it in 55% of cases to be sub- standard. Liability was accepted in almost 46% of all claims. Until spring 2017 more than 220 claims were analysed ( information from www.sgar -ssar.ch ; retrieved December 2018). When analysing closed malpractice claims one has to be aware that they can only provide relative data on error rates. Claims data are best used for learning from the event and improving patient safety but not for measuring the level of harm. 3.3 Patient safety indicators from routine data The patient safety indicators (PSI) have been developed by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) in 2003 in order to provide information on complications and AEs following surgeries, medical procedures and child birth in acute care hospitals. The PSI are compiled from routine data normally found in the discharge record and can be used by hospitals to improve their patient safety. However, PSI are not used as such in Switzerland. Instead, individual indicators, such as the pressure ulcer rate or the surgical site infection rate, are collected by hospitals to ob- tain information on the quality of care. Foreign bodies left in a body cavity or surgical wound at the end of a procedure - a so called never event - are also counted. In the OECD Health Statistic 2017 Switzerland leads the rankings of 13 OECD countries with 12.3 foreign bodies left per 100 000 surgical discharges in 2015 (20). At first glance, these findings are disturbing. A closer look , Harm to patients in Switzerland \u00a9Swiss Patient Safety Foundation page 7 however, reveals differences in data collection as the O ECD report states that \u00abvariations in how countries record diagnoses and procedures and define hospital admissions can affect calculation of rates\u00bb. Most likely, Switzerland stands out due to an exact coding practice that is performed uniformly by professional coders and not by clinicians. In addition, Swiss samples are small, thus calculations may result in an artefact which may distort the picture. The differences between Swit- zerland and other O ECD countries may be therefore rather explained by different documentation quality than true differences in patient safety. 4. Summary In Switzerland, no exact quantitative statement on harm to patients is possible today. So far, a mix of methodologies is being used to collect information on patient harm that occurs in hospital s and primary care . Each of the methodologies mentioned in this report represents a de tail, b ut taken together the existing knowledge still does not make up the overall picture. For certain areas , such as long term care or home care no data on harm to patients are available , either because they are not collected or because they are not published. Furthermore, due to the different methodologies the existing data are not comparable and do not allow a national benchmarking. There is no reason to believe that patient harm is more or less frequent in Switzerland than in other developed c ountries. It is estimated that every 10th patient is experiencing at least one adverse event during hospitalisation in Switzerland, resulting in more than 100 000 harmed patients yearly. The published data are in line with internationally published figures despite methodological differ- ences . Diagnostic errors for example are judged to be a significant and common challenge in healthcare (21). The report even states that most people will experience at least one diagnostic error in their lifet ime. But measuring diagnostic errors is challenging. Autopsies are a limited data source to determine the incidence of diagnostic errors since they are only conducted on people who have di ed, meaning all errors that did not involve death are not captured by this method. Fur- thermore, autopsies are only conducted upon request and autopsy rates are continually declining in the last decades. Other methods to measure the incidence and nature of diagnostic errors such as medical records reviews or malpractice claims have limitations too, why it is necessary to work further on new approaches to monitor the diagnostic process in order to identify, learn from and reduce diagnostic er rors. Other harm is measured more easily. But as stated in section 3 of this report, Switzerland is not even using the existing methodologies sufficiently . We are missing a national monitoring of patient harm. Data on the incidence of preventable AEs, the kind of injury and the severity of harm have to be known in order to improve patient safety . These data are necessary to identify the need of cor- rective measures within the system and to regulate them. Without a systematic data collection ac- curate information on the extent of patient harm in the Swiss healthcare system will not be availa- ble and the opportunity of learning from mistakes and improving the healthcare system passes unused. We are aware that Switzerland has still a long way to go to establish a healthcare system that knows about its frequency of harm and streaks with all its ef forts to prevent them. We are con- vinced there is no need to be afraid of transparency. Measuring harm might lead to higher harm rates which does not necessarily mean a worse performance. On the contrary, higher harm rates may reflect more developed patient safety monitoring systems and a stronger patient safety cul- ture.

About us Swiss Patient Safety Foundation The Swiss Patient Safety Foundation is the national competence centre for developing and pro- moting patient safety. It has been founded in 2003 by the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) and the Federal Social Insurance Office, the Swiss Academy of Medical Sciences and numerous professional associations. The foundation works for a constructive and consequent safety culture in the Swiss healthcare system. All its activities rely on cooperation with institutions and a large networ k of experts from Switzerland and abroad. The foundation's activities focus on projects and programmes, research, training, further education and continued development as well as advice and expertise. The foundation's national programmes, called progress! aim to improve significant systemic safety deficiencies by means of a methodical, evidence- based and practice- oriented approach. The pro- grammes always include elements for implementation, evaluation and monitoring and are accom- panied by an awareness campai gn. The programmes have been initiated in 2012 as part of the federal government's quality strategy. Since then, the foundation has been conducting five pro- grammes, of which progress! Medication safety in nursing homes and progress! CoM Check - safe surger y are still ongoing. The programmes are developed in cooperation with leading experts and receive substantial financial support from the FOPH. The research projects of the foundation such as speak up and double checking in oncology, gen- erate new knowledge that is transferred into practice through recommendations for healthcare pro- fessionals. The foundation publishes its research findings in peer -reviewed journals and thus helps to spread the knowledge to the broader scientific community. The foundation also maintains the national platform CIRRNET, the Critical Incident Reporting & Reacting Network. CIRRNET has been established in 2006 in order to bring together the local error reporting systems to allow learning from others. Today, Patient Safety Switzerland manages the network, identifies nationally relevant problem areas in patient safety, works together with experts to develop recommended actions and publishes them as \"Quick -Alerts\u00ae \". In line with the increasing efforts of the healthcare system to make healthcare safer, the Swiss Pa- tient Safety Foundation will continue to develop solutions for enhancing patient safety and the nec- essary principles and tools to disseminate them. Wherever people work, mistakes will happen. It is our duty to support service pr oviders and health care organisations to prevent the mistakes of to- morrow.

Safe communication between staff and with patients Annegret F. Hannawa, Ph.D. Associate Professor and Director, Center for the Advancement of Healthcare Quality and Patient Safety (CAHQS) , Faculty of Communication Sciences , Universit\u00e0 della Svizzera italiana (USI) This is a contribution to the Swiss National Report on Quality and Safety in Healthcare. Date of submission : 6.11.2018 Disclosure : There are no conflicts of interest. 2 Abstract Inadequate communication among healthcare professionals and with patients and care companions is consistently identified as a core contributing factor to adverse events and as a key determinant of poor quality care . Numerous communication improvement tools have been implemented in healthcare to resolve this problem. While they have attained some effects, the problem remains large: Too many patients are still harmed every day because care participants fail to establish a shared understanding with each other. This report summarizes the communication improvement tools that have been implemented to date to address this cause and briefly discusses their measured effects. It also introduces a new framework that conceptualizes safe communication as a fundamental resilience- enhancing interpersonal process that affects quality and safety across all contexts and stages of care. This \"SACCIA\" framework pursues a systematic improvement of all care participants' (i.e. providers, patients and care companions) communication skills over time, accompanied by scienti fic measurement of the im pact of these improvements on the quality and safety of care. In other words, it pursues a first evidence base for the formulation of context -independent \"safe communication\" guidelines, and it provides a blueprint that care instit utions as well as educators, students and practitioners of medicine and nursing across Switzerland may use to enhance the quality and safety of their practice in sustainable ways . 3 Safe communication between staff and with patients Quality and safety are a central concern in healthcare across the globe.1,2 Every 10th patient is harmed instead of cured during hospital care. At a rate of 0,1%,3 the estimated mortality that results from such harm appears small at first gl ance. B ut the felt impact of this fragment on patients is tremendous: The Swiss Federal Office for Statistics counts about 1.5 million hospitalizations across Switzerland every year.4 This means that over 160 patients are harmed and 4 patients die at Swiss hospital s every day as a result of a medical error. Up to 80% of these events are triggered by unsafe communication,5 such as insufficient or inaccurate information exchange, poor documentation, the failure to read patient records, unclear discharge instructions, and miscommunication due to linguistic discrepancies.6 Thus, inadequate communication frequently stands in the way to successful care provision and causes severe patient harm. Politicians have recognized this problem as well : the Swiss, German and Austrian health ministries jointly dedicated the International Patient Safety Day 2017 to the topic \"communication.\"7 Communication interventions in healthcare The fact that interpersonal communication constitutes a severe sa fety challenge in healthcare has been widely known for some time now. S everal communication frameworks, tools and techniques have been developed and implemented across the globe to standardize message content in healthcare interactions - both for the purpose of preventi ng harm , and for optimizing communication in response to harm ful events . Communication frameworks for preventi ng harm Probably the most well -known framework for a team -based approach to harm prevention is TeamSTEPPS8 (Team Strategies and Tools to Enhance Performance and Patient Safety). The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and AHRQ jointly developed this outcomes -based framework, which promotes four teachable skills to optimize team performance: Leadership, situation monitoring, mutual support, and communication. The \"communication\" domain within this framework encompas ses several (mostly mnemonic) techniques, including : - IPASS9 (Introduction, Patient, Assessme nt, Situation, Safety), which aims to enhance information exchange during care transitions (\"handoffs\") , - SBAR10 (Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation and Request) for communicating critical information that require immediate response and/or action , - \"Check -back \" (i.e. closed- loop) communication for validating message receipt , and - \"Call-outs\" for communicating important or critical information to other team members . Other communication tools have been developed to address more context - specific communication challenges. For example, SPIKES11 constitutes a six-step protocol for disclosing bad news to cancer patients about their illness ( Setting up the interview, assessing the patient's Perception, obtaining the patient's I nvitation, giving 4 Knowledge and information to the patient, addressing the patient's Emotions with empathic response, and Strategy and Summary). Very few experimental (i.e. before- after) designs , controlled trials or meta- analyses have been conducted t o date t o measure and summarize t he impact of thes e harm -prevent ing communication improvement tools on healthcare quality and patient safety. In particular , high-quality studies are lacking. T here is some evidence on the effective ness of SBAR implementation s on patient outcomes, but this evidence is limited to specific circumstances (e.g. communication over the phone ).12 Similarly, only few experimental studies have test ed the effects of IPASS on objective outcomes . The most successful study in this context evidenced a 30% decrease in the rate of preventable adverse events , but only at two-thirds of the investigated sites.13 No studies to date have been conducted in Switzerland to systematically measure pre- post effects of the abovementioned prevent ive communication techniques on healthcare quality and patient safety (i.e. to prevent patient safety events). Framed within the focal theme of the International Patient Safety Day 2017, the Swiss health ministry launched a national \"Speak -up\" program with the premise that care participants' willingness to speak up when they perceive a patient safety risk could reduce communication errors and/or adverse events. H owever, to date, evidence supporting that premise is sparse and limited to mostly qualitati ve inquiries. Objective pre-post effects of speak -up interventions on quality and safety outcomes have not been measured with consistent findings.14 In fact, one study report s that speak -up- induced \"collective vigilance\" (e.g. the process by which health care professionals pick up on potential errors made by another clinician) may actually create risk because reliance on others to catch and correct errors may erode individual s' professional accountability.15 Thus, also with respect to the speak -up program , empirical evidence remains sparse and inconsistent. Frameworks for optimizing communication in response to harm Communication between staff and with patients and care companions after harm has occurred ( which is commonly summarized under the term \"medical error disclosure\") may be as relevant to healthcare quality and patient safety as communication for the prevention of harm. Toolkits like CANDOR16 (Communication and Optimal Resolution) prescribe the organizational processes that facilitate a timely, thorough, and just response to unexpected patient harm. T he MEDC17-19 (Medical Error Disclosure Competence) model focuses on the interpersonal processes that constitute safe disclosures of adverse events (i.e. disclosures that cause benef icial rather than harmful outcomes at all levels of the healthcare system). S everal s ystematic outcomes - based studies with representative national samples have been conducted under a SNF grant in Switzerland to generate and validate evidence- based \"safe disclosure\" guideli nes (see Appendix) , purely based on Swiss data.18,19 These studies have evidenced significant effects of MEDC -guidelines -adherent disclosures on patients' symptom s and coping tactics on personal, relational, institutional and societal levels . 5 Barriers to safe communication for the prevention of harm As shown above, n one of the preventive communication i nterventions to date have been successful in \"solv ing\" the communication problem. Studies have reported some results, but the problem remains large. One reason for this may be that healthcare is situated in a communication- hostile environment : many people from different professional and sociodemographic backgrounds with variable linguistic and cognitive proc essing ski lls must quickly and many times a day achieve a shared understanding with each other in a setting that is compromised by distracting noises, limited privacy, immense time pressures and questions co ncerning what matters most of us: life and death. Another reason may be that the medical field still understands communication as a synonym for \"information \": A conduit metaphor that is commonly found in the medical literature is that communication \"fails\" or \"breaks down\" in the same way like an engine or a telephone fails to operate.20-24 This misconception is further reinforced by manifold care innovations t hat now delegate interpersonal sense- making processes to digitized pathways . But communication transpires between people. It encompasses complex encoding, decoding and transactional sense- making processes that cannot be delegated. Thus, c ommunication \"problems\" are not a symptom that can be \"fixed\" like a knee by a prosthesis. Communication is not a problem , it is our human nature. We were born to communicate, but not with the competency to communicate well: A sizeable percentage of the av erage population lacks fundamental communication skills and experiences difficulties negotiating the necessities of everyday life through their interactions with others.25-28 As a result, we commonly encounter disruptive experiences in our interpersonal encounters.28 At the same time, competent communication can have positive health effects that are as substantial as almost anything that modern medicine can offer in terms of extending people's lifespans.29-32 Communication interventions to date have not considered these processes sufficiently to inform urgently needed core competencies and \"safe practice\" guidelines that apply across all stages and contexts of care. That said, the path forward is clear: beyond standardizing message contents with the help of mnemonics and digitiz ed communication channels in the healthcare setting, we must make our fundamental interpersonal sense -making processes more resilient to failure .33,34 Our case analyses have shown that by doing so, we can affect that patients no longer receive wrong -site surgery, come out of anaesthesia with a foreign object in their body, get the wrong kind or dose of medication, carry away the consequences of wrong or delayed diagnoses, or go home with discharge instructions they do not understand.20-24 By doing so, we could prevent a majority of the 60'000 patient injuries and 1'500 deaths that are incurred at Swiss hospitals every year,1,4 and we could save a majority of the annual healthcare spending that currently flows into the correction of adverse events.1 If we do not invest the necessary labour for attaining consistent mutual understanding at the frontline of care, miscommunication will continue to penetrate everyday healthcare encounters and cause substantial harm. Thus, \"safe c ommunication\" must become recognized as a core competency for safe, high- quality care. 6 What does \"safe communication\" look like? Based on our scientific analyses of hundreds of patient safety events (the results of which we have published in four books) , we conceptualize \"safe communication\" as an interpersonal sense -makin g practice that adheres to five core competencies summarized under the acronym \"SACCIA\".20-24 These competencies encompass \"all verbal and nonverbal behaviours that, through adequate quantity (i.e. S ufficiency) and quality (i.e. A ccuracy, Clarity, Contextualization, Interpersonal Adaptation), optimize the likelihood of achieving most appropriate a nd effective care outcomes.\"20 Each of these five \"safe communication\" pr actices entails participants' encoding, decoding, and transactional (i.e., mutually negotiated) sense- making processes .35 In other words, all participants involved in a healthcare episode (1) abstract (i.e., encode) complex thoughts, intentions, meanings or feelings they have in mind into written, oral, and nonverbal messages; (2) reassemble (i.e., decode) the written, oral, and nonverbal messages they \"received\" to match the sende r's originally intended thoughts, intentions, meaning or feelings; and (3) engage in mutual negotiation (i.e., transactional communication) of these expressed thoughts, intentions, meaning or feelings to co- create a shared understanding. These three sense- making processes are inherent in all five \"safe communication\" practic es that are summarized by the \"SACCIA\" framework :20-24 o Sufficiency - the extent to which care participants convey, extract, and exchange a sufficient amount of information in order to arrive at a shared understanding. o Accuracy - the extent to which care participants convey correct information, interpret information correct ly, and utilize their communication with each other to validate the accuracy of their communicated message contents. o Clarity - the extent to which care participants express and interpret verbal and nonverbal messages clearly (i.e., unambiguously), in order to reduce uncertainties. o Contextualization - the extent to which care participants frame their interaction within local interactional circumstances (such as hierarchies, time pressure, or discrepant goals) that either facilitate or create barriers to shar ed understanding. o Interpersonal Adaptation - the extent to which participants implicitly (nonverbally) and explicitly (verbally) express needs and expectations that maximize the likelihood of shared understanding. In sum, directly filling the abovementioned void in the current literature, t hese five SACCIA core competencies operationalize \"safe communication\" as a fundamental resilience- enhancing interpersonal process for impro ving the quality and safety of healthcare. In contrast to existing communication improvement tools that have mostly resorted to mnemonics and simple communication techniques to address specific acute communica tion challenges (e.g. handoffs, bad news, critical situations) in healthcare, the SACCIA framework is grounded in extensive communication science analyses of (all kinds of) actual patient safety events . While existing tools have primarily focused on enhancing clinicians' information transfer and standardizing the quantity of sent and received message content, the SACCIA framework focuses on the interpersonal sense- making process between all care participants and advances evidence- based core competencies that make this process 7 more resilient to failure. In other words , it addresses all safety communication rather than a specific context or tool, and it involves staff, patients and care companions as equivalent partners for the establishment of a \"shared understanding\" . Our most recent study36 has shown that both patients and providers in the Ticino healthcare system also perceive SACCIA -safe interpersonal communication as a core element of \"quality care\" , evidencing that the SACCIA framework reaches beyond patient safety . Both clinicians and patients referenced the full spectrum of SACCIA -safe communication when talking about \"good\" and \"poor\" quality care episodes. This first Switzerland- based \"SACCIA\" study evidenced that \"quality care\" is characterized by a consistent SACCIA -safe communication practice that ensures effective interpersonal sense -making between staff and with patients and care companions across all care contexts. The study further underlines that health outcomes can be enhanced when clinicians communicate well with each other and with patients , and comprom ised when they interact poorly. These findings are consistent with many studies that have shown that poor communication is a core determinant of \"quality care\"37,38 and a leading root cause of a majority of preventable adverse events.5 What needs to be done to improve \"safe communication\" at the frontline of health care in Switzerland? There are two necessary steps to affect practice improvements at the frontline of Swiss care. First, we need to identify the problematic behaviou rs that needs to be changed, i.e. the concrete communication practices that cause these prevalent cases of patient harm. With the research we have accomplished to date, we have identified that the five interpersonal \"SACCIA\" -processes consistently cause harm at the frontline of care. The second step is to change these communication practices at the frontline of care to avoid that these cases of harm continue to happen in the future. Thus, as a next step, we need to examine the extent to which an interpersonal \"SACCIA- safe communication\" practice at the frontline of care will improve the frequency with which care participants (i.e. clinicians, patients and care companions) establish a shared understanding and, consequentially, improve the quality and safety of care in measurable ways . In other words , we must establish a scientific evidence base for a new (yet non- existing) communication- based \"safe practice\" standard for all health professions . This objective requires that science and government walk hand- in-hand : In science , we are now in the process of developing and validating a blended- learning \"SACCIA\" intervention for current and future practitioners of medicine and nursing, which will be implement able by medical schools and quality managers to enhance the safety and quality of everyday care in flexible, sustainable ways . We need the government to pave the pathway for these implementations to reach and affect the frontline of care nationwide. What are the barriers and challenges for improving \"safe communication\" in the Swiss healthcare system ? The key barrier , in my view , lies in our traditional healthcare culture. Medical schools and healthcare institutions have their own established routines and 8 procedures. Many do not see the need to change, either because they perceive no problem ( i.e. lack of awareness) or because they are already doing something they perceive as sufficient for address ing the problem (i.e. \"Wobegon effect\"39,40). In other words, the potential of safe communi cation interventions to improve the safety and quality of care is, just like with any other intervention, compromised by a dominant healthcare culture that is generally resistant to change. Cultural change must grow from the inside out, but this growth must be accompanied by clear rules and formal standards (i.e. guidelines ) that are evidence- based in the current state of science and recognized as such a t the frontline of care. In terms of the \"safe communication\" topic, we must rescue communication from its exile as a nice- to-have soft skill . We must formally recognize \"safe communication\" as a core \" safe practice\" criterion for harm prevention, just like it is recognized as a core contributing factor in causing severe patient harm . We must enforce this recognition with clear formalized practice guidelines that reflect the current \"state of science\" (i.e. evidence- based care provision ), and we must ensure that these guidelines reach the frontline of care across Switzerland. What are the strengths of Swiss healthcare in applying/implementing/developing this theme? The Swiss health ministry has already recognized the importance of safe communication for improving the safety and quality of care in Switzerland .7 It has also acknowledged the importance of the SACCIA model in particular for affecting the required change.23 Thus, the fundament for a nationwide \"safe communication\" implementation is established. A close collaboration between government and science from this point forward can affect the needed practice improvements, pending further scientific evidence (as discussed above) . Summary A widespread (i.e. nationwide) \"safe communication\" intervention that blankets the Swiss healthcare system has the potential to affect lasting improvements in the safety and quality of care with considerable impact. The expected innovations and improvements that will be advanced by such an intervention are threefold: First, we could provide a strong evidence base for the advancemen t, implementation and assessment of first context -independent \"safe communication\" guidelines that focus on optimizing the quality and safety across all stages and contexts of care , thereby addressing an urgent void in the patient safety discipline. Second, the teachi ng materials and assessment tools we are developing for medical and nurs ing education and practice are usable by all stakeholders, following the exact procedures we lay out in our scientific \"blueprint\" , to lastingly improve the safety and quality of care. Last but not least, a nationwide \"safe communication\" intervention could help us prevent a large amount of the 60'000 patient injuries and 1'500 patient deaths that are incurred in Swiss hospital care every year, and it may save a major ity of our annual healthcare spending that currently flows into the correction of preventable adverse events - not because of modernized medicine, but by strengthening clinicians, patients and care companions as core resources for enhancing resilience at the frontline of care. 9 References [1] Slawomirski N, Auraaen A, Klazinga N.

(2) If possible, the patient should bring a care companion to the disclosure. (3) Invite a neutral (external) third party to the disclosure (as a person of trust for the patient). (4) Be prepared to send the patient a written account after the disclosure so the patient can revisit and better understand the communicated information (if de sired by the patient). (5) Make sure you schedule plenty of time for the disclosure (no time limit would be ideal). (6) Recognize the disclosure as a gradual, sequential conversation (there will be more than one meeting with the patient, the patient will need time to process and revisit the information). DO NOT invite too many care participants to the disclosure - the number of clinicians should not outnumber the patients' side. DO NOT disclose an error over the phone. Enter the disclosure with the motivation to... (1) establish a close, trusting relationship with the patient (as a foundation for mutual empathy). (2) maintain a relationship with the patient (opening the door for the patient to return in the future). (3) invest into the relationship with the patient (\"paying for\" the error in relational terms). (4) demonstrate relational sincerity (take the patient seriously, convey genuine respect). (5) straighten things out for the patient (e.g., in light of the error's impact on the patient's life). (6) alleviate the implications of the error for the patient's personal and professional life. DO NOT appear avoidant, distant, or defensive. Enter the disclosure with informed knowledge about the patient's... (1) informational preferences (i.e., participatory or authoritarian care style). (2) medical history/records. (3) personal preferences (e.g., what type of person the patient is, what the patient [doesn't] want). DO NOT enter the disclosure unprepared. During the disclosure, demonstrate the following communication skills : (1) Attentiveness (i.e. sit in front or next to the patient; directly face the patient; occasionally lean toward the patient; make appropriate eye contact with the patient; look at the patient while s/he talks; show the patient that you are listening to him/her; show the patient that you have made it a prio rity to be here with him/her; seek personal contact with the patient and take his/her comments seriously; demonstrate a certain devotion to the patient's needs; show the patient that you truly care for his health and well -being). (2) Composure (i.e. humbly try to calm down the situation; use a calm voice; calmly explain what happened; talk with calm confidence). (3) Coordination (i.e. pause occasionally/appropriately to give the patient an opportunity to react). (4) Expressiveness (i.e. display a small smile whe n you enter the room; use a kind tone of voice; talk to the patient very clearly; try to talk in simple terms; be empathic but do not get too emotional - remain informative and clear). 13 (5) Interpersonal adaptability (i.e. embrace any cognitive, linguistic, i nformational and/or emotional needs/expectations that the patient expresses, verbally or nonverbally, during the disclosure conversation; feel out the patient and see how s/he reacts; for example, be sensitive to the patient's needs to decide something on his/her own; adapt to the patient's language, check whether the patient understands what you are saying; try to get inside the patient's head and skin; get a feel of how much information the patient needs so s/he does not get overwhelmed; see whether the p atient needs a hand on the shoulder). DO NOT introduce physical barriers to the conversation (e.g. a desk in between you and the patient, stacked -up charts, a ringing phone or beeper). DO NOT use technical language or medical terms that the patient cannot understand. During the disclosure, make sure to explicitly state the following contents : Maintain your communication skills ! Give the patient opportunities to ask questions; keep your calm voice; stay attuned and adapt your informational contents to the patients' needs and expectations; pay close attention to the patient while you explain things; keep your own nonverbal displays in mind and be careful not to overwhelm. (1) Be as open, honest, transparent, and authentic in your communication as possible. (2) Admit and assume responsibility for the error (if applicable, a statement of responsibility should also be conveyed by your supervisor). (3) Make sure to express remorse . (4) Provide an explanation of (a) what happened to this point in time (chronologically), (b) why the patient is there, (c) why and how this could happen, (d) what should have been done, and (e) if applicable, what the patient needs to do now as a conseque nce of the error (e.g., adjusted behaviors/medication intake etc.). Succinctly and clearly discuss the (a) consequences of the error and (7) corrective steps that will be taken. (5) Discuss what you will do / suggest do to next to correct the situation and/or repair the consequences of the error. (6) Discuss how you intend to repair the patient's health (so that the patient feels better). (7) Offer the patient psychological support. (8) If applicable, offer the patient financial reparation (that any extra costs will be covered). (9) If applicable, discuss how you intend to repair the patient's professional life (e.g., inform the patient's employer). (10) Ensure future forbearance by stating that you will actively engage in an investigation to reflect and draw consequences from this experience to prevent such errors in the future (conveying that the error didn't happen for nothing, but that it led to improve things). DO NOT ramble around. DO NOT ignore or deny the error. DO NOT downplay the situation / make seem everything half as bad. DO NOT display any arrogance whatsoever. 1 Safety culture in the context of Swiss healthcare : a contribution to the Swiss National Report on Quality and Safety in Healthcare Prof. 13.01.2019 Disclosure The author of this report has contributed to the validation of the Swiss -German and German language versions of one of the safety climate measures described in this report. The relevant contributions are referenced in this report and present no conflict of interest as there are no financial or other benefits to the author. Abstract Safety culture assessment and development is a key area of patient safety research and improvement. From a national perspective, the uptake of safety culture assessment in Swis s healthcare seems to have been very limited. Given that safety culture assessment instruments for a range of Swiss healthcare contexts have been adapted and psychometrically validated, the availability of suitable instruments is certainly not the limiting factor. This report identifies challenges and barriers concerning safety culture assessment and improvement at the project, organisational and policy level highlighting the importance of leadership engagement and collaboration across healthcare organisat ions. To overcome these challenges this report recommends to: 1. Establish an infrastructure ensuring access and support to increase the use of validated safety culture assessment instruments, 2. Develop approaches for safety culture assessment that incor porate the patient perspective, 3. Make it a requirement for healthcare organisations to engage in safety culture assessment and development while maintaining openness concerning the specific approach, 4. Prioritise trans -organisational learning over benchmarking and 5. Develop a systematic approach for linking safety culture assessment and improvement. In conclusion, there is an apparent lack of overview and coordination of ongoing efforts to measure and improve s afety culture that hinders transorganisational learning and local improvement. Nevertheless, there are many promising initiatives by individual healthcare organisations that could inform national programmes in this area. 2 1. The current state of safety cu lture in the context of Swiss healthcare This report provides an overview of the current state of safety culture in Swiss healthcare1 regarding two key issues o: safety culture assessment and safety culture improvement. Naturally, these issues are rather c losely linked since it is unlikely that improvements will be achieved without a prior assessment of safety culture,(1, 2) identification of areas that may require improvement and then by measuring to ascertain whether any improvement can be observed. 1.1 Wha t is safety culture? Safety culture is an aspect of organisational culture that refers to how safety is viewed and treated in organizations.(1) Generally, organisational culture is a relatively stable, multi- dimensional construct that is based on shared values and norms in the work environment that affect the attitudes, perceptions and behaviour of all members of an organisation.(3) Consequently, safety culture is comprised of employees' shared values and norms that orient the attitudes, perceptions and b ehaviour related to safety. Throughout high- risk industries, safety culture has been recognized as an essential foundation for any safety program to take its maximum effect. A culture that prioritises safety, facilitates safety -oriented management decisio ns and worker behaviour, supports learning from error and increases organisation's capability to effectively respond to known and emerging risks.(1) In healthcare the call for a culture of safety has become louder in recent years. This has mainly two reasons: First, the experience from a range of patient safety improvement efforts in various healthcare settings and different countries has shown that the success of these improvement projects has frequently been challenged by the prevailing culture. This has limited the sustainability of patient safety improvements in particular.(4, 5) Second, a growing number of studies highlights the relationship between a culture o f safety and patient outcomes.(6-9) 1.2 Safety culture assessment2 Whilst qualitative measures help to understand the underlying values and basic assumptions ,(1) the actual \"measurement\" of safety culture is usually based on a quantitative research approach. Internationally, a range of quantitatively oriented safety culture instruments have been developed and used extensively across safety - critical industries.(2, 10) While many of the theoretical constructs underpinning safety culture are similar across industries, healthcare- specific assessment instruments have been developed due to differences in the regulatory environment and in the organisational structures and processes related to safety management. Swiss validations of internationally established instruments. Several internationally established instruments for safety culture assessment in healthcare have been adapted and psychometrically validated for the Swiss c ontext.(11-16) Table 1 provides an overview of the available quantitative safety culture assessment instruments detailing; whether it was specifically developed for healthcare or based on another instrument, for which healthcare setting it is intended, in which of the Swiss 1 While the focus of this report is Swiss healthcare, some of the statements also apply to other healthcare contexts and are reported in the international patient safety literature as many of the challenges are not unique to a specific national or health system context. 2 In this report safety culture assessment comprises all qualitative or quantitative approaches to capturing facets of safety culture in a group of healthcare profes sionals. 3 national languages it is available and how it has been evaluated in terms of basic psychometric properties. Behaviourally focused developments. While most instruments in table 1 cover a set of safety culture dimensions that are quite si milar across instruments, there are some new developments available that address specific aspects of healthcare culture that may further or hinder specific safety -related behaviours of healthcare professionals.(17) On the one hand such thematically focused developments are a reflection of the need to conceptually expand safety culture to areas of safety relevant behaviours on which evidence has become available only recently. On the other hand these new developments point at some of the insufficiencies of previous instruments when aiming for and evaluating improvements with a specific behavioural focus. 1.3 Uses of assessment instruments and empirical findings on safety culture in Swiss healthcare3 While there is no complete picture of the level of implementation of safety culture surveys in Swiss healthcare or their findings, the literature provides some insights into the uses of assessment instruments and many (validation) studies report descriptive results such as mean values or percentages of positive/problematic responses.(12, 13, 18-23) In the year 2000, Sexton and colleagues(32) published a comparison between pilots and healthcare staff using a set of 23 items on safety culture from the operating room management attitudes questionnaire(33) and the intensive care unit management attitudes questionnaire.(32) Unfortunately, it is unclear from the publication exactly when data at the 12 hospitals in Italy, Germany, Switzerland, Israel, and the USA were collected and the analysis does not allow for identifying the characteristics and data of the Swiss sample. However, some of the research included was conducted in the early 1980s. The Swiss data may originate from a project at the University Hospital Basel in the early 1990s.(33) This marks the l ikely date of the first safety culture assessment in Switzerland. Other surveys published in the literature were: A report on the way in which the survey was used at the University Hospital Zurich in 2006.(34) A study assessing the effects of a crew resour ce management training on safety culture (see 1.4).(35) A study assessing patient safety culture among healthcare professionals in the emergency department of the University Hospital Bern and testing the impact of an intervention (see 1.4).(36) 3 It has to be noted that this section of the report is prone to publication bias because some healthcare organi sations prefer using their safety culture data for internal purposes , without publish their findings. 4 Table 1: Safety culture assessment instruments validated for a Swiss healthcare context Instrument name Patient Safety Climate Inventory (PaSKI)(11) French version of the Hospital Survey on Patient Safety Culture(12) Nursing Home Survey on Patient Safety Culture (NHSPSC -CH)(13) Safety attitudes questionnaire (SAQ -Swiss version)(14) Safety climate Survey (SCS)(15) Safety Organizing Scale (SOS- Swiss - version)(16) Speak up - related climate (SUPS-Q)(20) SafeQuest(18) Language region German speaking French speaking German speaking German speaking German speaking German speaking German speaking German speaking Care setting Hospital Hospital Nursing home Hospital Hospital Hospital Hospital Primary care / diagnostic service Target group All hospital staff All hospital staff Nurses Nurses and physicians Hospital staff in clinical settings Nurses Nurses and physicians All staff Based on Hospital Survey on Patient Safety Culture (HSOPS)(24) French language version(25) of the HSOPS(24) Nursing Home Survey on Patient Safety Culture(26) Safety attitudes questionnaire (SAQ)(27 ) (Short version) Safety climate survey (SCS)(28) Safety Organizing Scale (SOS)(29) Speak up climate safety scale (30) and own item development SafeQuest (31) Dimensions incl. number of items and Cronbach's Alpha () Teamwork within =.73) Teamwork =.86) Safety organizing scale safety (5; =.84 items; overall =.97 (range actions promoting patient safety (4; =.78) Supervisor expectations/ actions promoting patient safety (4; =.75) Supervisor expectations and promoting of safety (3; =.77) Safety climate (7; =.75) Encouraging environment for speaking (3; =.74 ) Organizational learning, continuous improvement (3; =.68) continuous improvement (3; =.57) management support for patient safety (3; =.83) Hospital management support for patient safety (3; =.79) Management support for resident safety (3; =.79) Stress recognition (4; =.79) 5 Feedback & communication about error (3; =.79) Feedback & communication about error (3; =.77) Feedback & communication about incidents (4; =.77) (3; (3; =.70) Teamwork across hospital units (4; =.76) Teamwork across hospital units (4; =.71) Training =.64) Hospital =.60) Nonpunitive response to errors (4; =.75) Unit management support for patient safety (4; =NR) Compliance with procedures (3; =.70) Unit handoffs and transitions (4; =NR) Outcome dimensions Overall perceptions of safety (4; =.75) Overall perceptions of safety (4; =.68) Overall perceptions of safety (3; =.83) Frequency of event reporting (3; =.88) Frequency of event reporting (3; =.86) All dimensions 14 12 12 6 1 1 3 NR Items 47 42 42 34 19 9 13 30 Note: NR= not reported 6 There are further studies that made use of safety culture surveys, or at least certain scales, as part of studies in Swiss healthcare with a different focus such as organisational factors associated with burnout or workforce issues.(37-42) However, these studies do not provide sufficient details on findings relat ed to safety culture to inform this report. Through her professional network, the author of this report is aware of a current safety culture assessment at the University Hospital Zurich in 2017 and 2020 and that other hospitals are considering conducting s imilar surveys (e.g. University Hospital Bern). It was exactly this lack of coordination and overview of ongoing efforts to measure and improve safety culture that led the Conference of Medical Directors4 to launch a large collaborative safety culture survey of all public hospitals in the French- and Italian- speaking regions of Switzerland in order to share the results and to use the experience in this field to define common actions for improvement. The survey was conducted over a three- year period from 2015- 2017 targeting medical, nursing and paramedical staff working with patients, as well as the senior hospital managers. With 32'000 staff receiving the survey the overall participation rate was 41% (rangi ng from 19% -74%). This is probably the most comprehensive dataset on safety culture in Swiss healthcare. 1.4 Safety culture improvement5 The evidence supporting the link between safety culture and patient outcomes or patient safety indicators is growing and strengthens the role of safety culture as a leading indicator.(6-9) Thus, one focus of patient safety programmes is frequently the development of a positive safety culture. Changes in safety culture related to patient safety interventions. In Switzerl and, for example, Haller and colleagues(35) found positive changes in team and safety climate and improved stress recognition after a training intervention in obstetrics. Recently, Ricklin and colleagues(36) tested the impact of an information campaign about patient safety on safety culture, finding no statistically significant effects. However, the intervention strength has to be considered as rather limited. Besides these examples of unit -based experiences at single institutions, safety culture assessment was also part of the evaluation strategy of a national quality improvement program.(23) Results showed no substantial change but small significant differences in the level of safety climate for some subgroups. Framing safety culture development. Most con ceptual models of culture development frame it as a cyclical process of organisational learning and thus safety culture is viewed as an input into what can be achieved in the next cycle rather than as an outcome.(5, 43) 4 The Conference of Medical Directors was created in 2009 bringing together the medical directors ( i.e. physicians serving as members of the management board) of public hospitals in the French- and Italian- speaking regions of Switzerland: the Geneva University Hospitals, the Federati on of Waldensian Hospitals, the Neuch\u00e2tel Hospital, the Fribourg Hospital, the Jura Hospital, the French- speaking Valais Hospital, the Ente Ospedalerio Cantonale and more recently, the Biel hospital centre. 5 In this report safety culture improvement refer s to targeted interventions/programs aiming to positively influence culture within a healthcare unit/organisation. 7 Based on this understanding of safet y culture development it is not surprising that most studies which aim to improve safety culture through an intervention that is very limited in time, intensity and organisational spread can only achieve a very limited change that is also extremely difficult to sustain .(5) Even resource intensive long -term intervention projects often struggle with the fact that the prevailing culture may undermine the effects of the intervention.(4) Also, as highlighted in the Swiss study by Mascherek and colleagues ,(23) other measures such as culture strengths should be considered when assessing safety culture development. Specifically targeting safety culture development. Since safety culture improvement is not a by -product of interventions such as team training or the introduction of new protocols, specific tools or practices are needed to facilitate safety culture improvement. These practices (e.g. safety walk -rounds, peer -reviews, recurrent team training) will have to bec ome part of the way the organisation operates on a routine basis before they can be expected to achieve the long -term effects expected of them. In the following, an example will be given of one such tool that has recently made its way from other industrie s to healthcare: \"safety culture dialogues\". Safety culture dialogues are conducted in teams that discuss predefined themes such as \"walkthroughs and audits\", \"supervisor behaviour after incidents\" or \"reporting and learning from harm\" (see figure 1 for an example). The aim of the discussion is to first describe typical behaviour regarding each theme to identify behavioural anchors for the five stages of safety culture maturity by Dianne Parker(44) building on her work on employee perceptions of these levels of maturity .(45) This discussion helps the team to conduct a thematically focused safety culture assessment of their unit or organisation and to understand that different maturity levels are present within one organisation at any given time. The second step is to develop a vision of which behaviours the team would like to see more of because these behaviours would help them to achieve the next level or at least function at that level more often. Figure 1: Cards for maturity level 4 and 5 on the theme \"supervisor attitudes\". 8 The unit for quality management and patient safety at the University Hospital Zurich was involved in the adaptation to healthcare and is currently gaining experience with various forms of conducting these dialogues to promote culture change (see http://icl - net.de/de/casespages/culture- dialogues -for-patient -safety ). 2. Challenges and barriers concerning safety culture assessment and improvement Project level. With one exception ,(34) published studies did not include a detailed description of the approach taken or the challenges faced when assessing safety culture in a Swiss healthcare organization. However, such reports would be extremely valuable to quality and safety practitioners thinking about similar projects in their organization. Organisational level. The main focus should be on raising the awareness of safety issues within the organisation and instilling a dialogue around the values underpinning the safe provision of healthcare. Thus, not simply the survey but particularly the discussion of results wi thin the organisation should be encouraged. It is possible that healthcare organisations might benefit from expert support on how best to conduct safety culture assessment, taking their organisational specifics into consideration, how to interpret the results and how best to link the discussion around assessment results with ongoing improvement efforts. However, the most important component of such a process is leadership involvement. Currently, leadership competencies in Swiss healthcare seem mainly orient ed towards management and clinical leadership. Policy level. So far, safety culture assessment has not been made mandatory in Swiss healthcare. This approach is very much aligned with the decentralised approach to healthcare regulation and management in Switzerland that has many positives. However, looking at other countries that have mandated safety culture assessment for all healthcare sectors at regular intervals, there seems t o be something to be gained from this approach; especially when not linking the assessment results to the accreditation of healthcare organisations but seeing them as an input into ongoing safety culture development. 3. Summary of the significant and relevan t changes and improvements that have taken place in Swiss Healthcare In recent years, there has been a stark increase in the availability of safety culture assessment instruments suitable for various Swiss healthcare settings. Much like other countries, sa fety culture assessment remains focused on acute care but has recently also gained attention in Swiss primary and long -term care settings. This very positive development provides the foundation for large- scale studies on the state of safety culture, on the impact of safety culture on relevant healthcare outcomes but also on factors influencing safety culture. However, such studies are still missing. Safety culture assessment is mostly limited to single institutions, sometimes even single units, and only a few established collaboratives have started to look at safety culture from a cross- organisational perspective. However, their experiences could be used by others 9 in making this a national undertaking and connecting measurement with improvement more closely . 4. Recommendations concerning safety culture assessment and improvement Given the already existing body of safety culture assessment instruments validated for a Swiss healthcare context it is rather surprising that the uptake seems to have been very limite d.6 As demonstrated in this report, the availability of suitable instruments is certainly not the limiting factor and existing instruments could easily be adapted for additional healthcare settings or national languages; especially since a number of resear chers with the relevant conceptual and methodological expertise are based in Switzerland. Infrastructure ensuring access and support. It may be that interested healthcare institutions without a research- oriented quality and safety unit find it challenging to a) identify the best instrument for their purposes (e.g. evaluation of unit -based team training interventions, baseline assessment across departments at the planning stages of a hospital -wide safety initiative), b) access and use the instruments in a way that allows for valid conclusions, and c) make their findings publicly available in the form of scientific publications. Recommendation 1: A repository of validated safety culture assessment instruments including user manuals and contacts for support s hould be established to promote open access to and correct use of existing instruments. This repository should be hosted and regularly updated by a national non- profit organisation in the field of patient safety. Incorporating the patient perspective. One area of future development in safety culture assessment internationally, but also in Switzerland, might be to explicitly consider patients' perspectives on patient safety culture. So far, there have been mostly qualitative studies eliciting patients' perspectives on safety relevant behaviours by themselves or by healthcare professionals.(47-51) Recently a new scale to quantitatively measure patients' perceptions of patient safety culture has been developed.(52) While these are only initial steps to appreciate the many ways in which patients perceive the safety culture of a healthcare organisation, their views provide a valuable addition since they are not prone to organisational blindness. Recommendation 2: The patient perspective should be considered as one area for expanding the scope of safety culture assessment throughout Swiss healthcare. To 6 Since there is no current data available on the implementation of systematic safety culture assessment in Swiss healthcare, this statement is based on the authors subjective experience working with Swiss healthcare organizations on issues related to safety culture and her knowledge of the safety culture literature. In a national survey on C linical Risk Management practices in Swiss hospitals , it was highlighted that the development of safety culture was one of the strategic risk management priorities for many hospitals and they acknowledged the key role of active leadership engagement in achieving this goal.(46) 10 account for the potential cultural differences between language regions, research on the development of instruments for capturing the patient perspective should be prioritised at a national level. Openness concerning the approach to safety culture assessment. Conducting a safety culture survey may be a good and seemingly simple first step. However, there are other forms of safety culture assessment that might be more suitable to a given healthcare organisation depending on its size, structure (e.g. organisations with very diverse, largely self-regulated service units), safety concerns, the level of leadership involvement in patient safety management, etc. For example, the safety culture dialogue mentioned above can be used as a tool to assess the current safety culture as well as to develop a shared vision of safety culture and define measure to shift the organisational safety culture in the intended direction. Such an approach offers a more dynamic, self -regulated way to continuously develop safety culture and frame this as a critical process rather than a key performance indicator. Recommendation 3: While there may be a general expectation for healthcare organisations to take a systematic approach to assessing and developing their safety culture, healthcare organisations should be allowed to choose their approach to safety culture assessment depending on their maturity level concerning patient safety management. T hus, when considering a mandatory approach to safety culture assessment at the national level, no restrictions to the methodological approach or a specific instrument should be applied. Each healthcare organisation should be able to decide between scientif ically established approaches based on the specifics of their organisation. Trans -organisational learning vs benchmarking. Following the example from the French- and Italian- speaking parts of Switzerland,(53) collaboration on safety culture assessment and development certainly provides an opportunity for trans -organisational learning. However, safety culture should be taken seriously as a leading indicator rather than a performance measure of healthcare organisations. As healthcare is only just beginning t o understand the impact of this cultural foundation for any kind of improvement programme, collaboration is likely to be the best way to establish best practices linking safety culture measurement and improvement. Recommendation 4: Healthcare organisations should be encouraged to collaborate when assessing and developing safety culture and to prioritise leadership involvement in promoting safety. This could lead to a pooling of resources and identification of best practices. In contrast, simple benchmarking approaches should be explicitly discouraged in light of the empirical evidence on regionally different response patterns in Switzerland and the impact of organisational as well as sample characteristics on healthcare professionals' responses to safety cul ture assessment.(23, 54, 55) If one still wishes to establish any kind of benchmarking report, this task should be delegated to an established research group in the field of safety culture research with the necessary scientific expertise. 11 Linking safety c ulture assessment and improvement. The call for a culture change in healthcare has become louder in recent years, especially as the success of patient safety improvement efforts has frequently been challenged or compromised by the prevailing safety culture; especially when it comes to sustainability.(4, 5) Safety culture assessment can provide valuable information to support successful implementation. However, the interpretation of safety culture data is quite different from the classical medical paradigm. For example, in clinical studies, overlapping confidence intervals indicate that there was no effect of an intervention. In the context of safety culture assessment these overlaps can be interpreted as a sign of culture strength. Depending on the initial assessment, one aim of an intervention might be to reduce differences in perception across units and to increase culture strength. Further, a sustained change in safety culture may reflect a shift in safety -related attitudes and values within an organisation, making safety -oriented behaviours a shared norm and thus more likely to occur. Recommendation 5: Not only the overall level of safety culture but also the patterns of safety culture data need to be considered carefully when planning and evaluation interventions for safety culture improvement. Additionally, safety culture assessment should thus be linked to behavioural indicators of shifting attitudes, norms and values related to patient safety. Therefore, research linking safety culture assessment and improvement should be the focus of a national research programme. References 1. Manser T, Br\u00f6sterhaus M, Hammer A.

Using appropriate indicators allows both to indicate areas needing improvement and to evaluate the effectiveness and impact of interventions aimed at improving quality and safety. We conducted a rapid literatur e review to assess the current state of quality and patient safety in the healthcare system, mainly by means of indicators. Globally, this review of indicators of quality and safety available in Switzerland over the last decade confirm that quality of care and patient safety are reasonably good in Switzerland. However, the results observed in presence of international comparisons or with acknowledged or evidence- based standards indicate first that the performance is usually not better in Switzerland than in other developed countries, and second that in many areas there is room for further improvement. The review indicated that only a few indicators are routinely established by the federal office of public health ( FOPH ) and other national organisations (e.g., Swiss National Association for Quality Development in Hospitals and Clinics (ANQ )). However, the many publications we found, about 150 between 2008 and 2018, indicate a patchy coverage by domain and geographic areas. A national effort is needed to allow t he development, and evaluation, of valid indicators that could be implemented and evaluated nationwide at a reasonable cost. The indicators should inform the healthcare professionals to help them improve their practice and the healthcare managers and decis ion makers to adapt the system, the structures and the conditions to allow providing high quality healthcare, with optimal patient safety. 4 Introduction According to the world health organisation ( WHO ),\"Poor -quality health care around the globe causes ongoing damage to human health. In low - and middle- income countries (LMICs), between 5.7 and 8.4 million deaths occur each year from poor quality of care, which means that quality defects cause 10 to 15 per cent of the total deaths in these countries. The resulting costs of lost productivity alone amount to between $1.4 and $1.6 trillion each year.\" 1 Actually, patient safety and quality of care are also major issues in developed countries . The median overall incidence of in- hospital adverse events was 9.2% (8 studies, about 75'000 patient records ) (1). The median percentage of preventability w as 43.5% (1). The OECD2 Health Care Quality and Outcomes programme (formerly known as Health Care Quality Indicators Project) was initiated in 20013. The aim of this project was to develop and report indicators for international comparisons of health care quality. Over the past twenty years, series of data collection and analys es have been carried out . The coverage of the dimensions expanded progressively, within the framework proposed by OECD . These developments were brought up by contributions from a representative group of ex perts from OECD and non- OECD countries, international organisations including the WHO, the European Commission and other relevant collaborating institutions, including universities, subject matter experts and research organisations (OECD3). The 2011 WHO - OECD report on the performance of the Swiss healthcare system indicates that the information system should be improved, also to allow better assessment of quality and safety. The Swiss law on medical insurance indicates that mandatory health insurance should cover the interventions that are effective, appropriate and economical (Art 32). Quality of care is indicated in another article (Art 58), which allow the Federal government to organise scientific and systematic quality controls. These ac tivities can be delegated to professional associations or other appropriate stakeholders. Following several initiatives, the Federal office of public health (FOPH) has introduced some quality measures, and the Swiss National Association for Quality Development in Hospitals and Clinics (ANQ ) has developed a series of measures that are mandatory in hospitals. Therefore, assessing the performance of the healthcare system, including the quality and safety of healthcare procedures, is also compulsory. Using appropriate quality and safety indicators allows both to indicate areas needing improvement and to evaluate the effectiveness and impact of interventions aimed at improving quality and safety. The purpose of this literature review was to provide an aut horitative overview of what is currently known about the safety and quality of healthcare in Switzerland. A comprehensive coverage of every aspect of Swiss healthcare was not feasible or desirable. Instead, this review focus ed on a limited number of core areas that included indicators of healthcare quality, indicators of patient safety, initiatives and projects to assess quality and safety, and evaluations and reviews of quality and patient safety. 1 WHO; Crossing the Global Quality Chasm: Improving and Development 3 OECD - http://www.oecd.org/health/health -care -quality -framework.htm 5 Methods Literature and information search We searched the Medline database via Pub Med from 2008 up to 25 November 2018. The search strategy was limited to studies involving human subjects and Swiss data. There were no language restrictions or study design limitation. We used a combination of MeSH4 terms (e.g., \"Quality Indicators, Health Care\"[ MeSH ]; \"Patient Safety\"[ MeSH ]), free text words (e.g., healthcare associated injury), Boolean terms (e.g., AND, OR) and truncations (e.g., medical error* ) where possible. The search strategy was originally developed for a study protocol (2) and was adapted for our work. The search strategy for this review is presented in appendix 1. Moreover, additional studies were added due to authors' expertise in the domain of study. In addition to the electronic literature search and hand search, we searched additional sources of information, such as the websites of the Federal government, organisations, foundations and associations involved in quality and safety assessment, programmes, etc. On December 11, 2018 we searched the websites of FOPH (www.bag.admin.ch/bag/fr), the Swiss health Observatory (O bsan : www.obsan.admin.ch), and the Swiss National Association for Quality in Hospitals (ANQ, www.anq.ch), for publications or reports . Eligibility of studies Limited by time of publication (2008 and upwards), studies were eligible for inclusion if they covered any of the following topics: Indicators of healthcare quality Indicators of patient safety Initiatives and projects to assess quality and safety Evaluations and reviews of quality and patient safety Adverse events and medication errors Appropriateness of healthcare interventions and adherence to guidelines Satisfaction and opinion surveys and patient -reported outcomes The included studies should have included data collected in Switzerland , but could also contain data from other countries, i.e. in international studies with separate results for Switzerland. Data abstraction and analysis We abstracted the following data: study identification information, study main characteristics, patients' character istics, and relevant outcomes. Two reviewers (BB & MA) were independently involved in the search, selection and abstraction of data. We used www.covidence.org for the process of study selection. Discrepancies were s olved upon discussions and consensus. We intended to provide a descriptive and qualitative synthesis of results due to our study design. Therefore, it was not feasible to estimate the potential risk s of bias of the included studies. Synthesis of informatio n There are various ways to describe and present healthcare quality and safety indicators. We used a mix of several approaches, including the classical presentation according to Donabedian categories (structure, process, outcomes), We also used other classification approaches, such as healthcare location ( in- vs outpatient care) , according to the study scope (local or regional, national, international), to the type of information (use of routinely vs ad hoc collected data or survey). Some data were issued from quality and safety monitoring initiatives, other from health services research projects. The scope of indicators may also be narrow, such as the appropriateness of a specialized intervention for a specific disease or 4 Medical Subject Heading 6 wider, such as the general opinion and satisfaction about hospital care. Moreover, the indicators were related to different clinical fields, such as general or family medic ine, specialised care (e.g., surgery, anaesthesiology ), or care for chronic or complex diseases that requires the collaboration of multiple healthcare professionals. Eventually, to facilitate their appraisal for the reader, we classified the results in a n ordered stratified description, by : geographic coverage (nationwide vs regional or local) o frequency of assessment (routine vs occasional) type of care: in - vs outpatient (general or specialized)) several subcategories : o mortality o infection (healthcare related, hospital acquired) o other adverse events o appropriateness of care o opinion and satisfaction We have thus grouped indicator s of quality and safety together; one may actually consider that safety is included in a broader assessment of quality. Our stratified and hierarchic classification ended in a potential maximum of 60 categories ; however, what we found clustered in 15 groups only. 7 Results Study selection and characteristics The search strategy resulted into the inclusion of 142 studies a fter removal of duplicates and screening of titles and abstracts followed by full -text articles. Figure 1 shows the results of the search strategy (Appendix 2 ). The included studies fulfilled our eligibility criteria and they had addressed at least one of the research topics cited in the methods above. The studies covered a wide variety of interventions (such as primary care, in hospital care or inpatient care) and some focused on particular diseases ( such as colorectal cancer, diabetes, acute coronary syndrome, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)). Most studies were conducted in Switzerland while some were international studies with separated data for Switzerland were also included. Table 1 shows all included studies with some characteristics (Appendix 3) . Nationwide assessments Routinely collected data In-patient care Mortality Since 2006, FOPH has developed and improved a series of inpatient quality i ndicators (CH - IQI) to allow monitoring the quality of inpatient care in acute care hospitals. These indicators were developed initially in a pilot project, since 2009, and then adapted in a collaborative framework with Germany and Austria. They are calculated from the hospital discharge summaries annually submitted by Swiss hospitals to the Federal Office of statistics. The data include discharge diagnoses according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD - 10, evolving versions) and to the CHOP procedure classification (Swiss classification of surgical interventions). The main indicators are inpatient standardised mortality ratios for a series of diagnoses (e.g., myocardial infarction, pneumonia) and interventions (e.g., surgery for colorectal cancer), and the number of cases for some special situations or interventions (e,g., caesarean section). For each Swiss acute care hospital, the results are presented for the index year and the average of the five years preceding the index year, by hospital (3). Infection In addition to the evaluation of patient satisfaction, several other, classical, safety indicators are assessed nationwide in the framework of the ANQ measures in hospitals. Surgi cal site infection is monitored in collaboration with the Swissnoso network, by ad hoc surveys. The assessment of hospital acquired infection s was developed relatively early; in 1994 FOPH ask the specialists in infectious diseases and hospital hygiene to develop programmes to reduce the occurrence of hospital acquired infections and antibiotic resistance. The Swissnoso network organises the data collection to monitoring surgical site infection and hand hygiene guidance observance, in the framework of the ANQ ( www.swissnoso.ch ). A report presented the results of the Swiss national surgical site infection (SSI) surveillance program, over a 4 -year period (2011- 15) in 164 Swiss public and private hospitals with surgical activities. A total of 187,501 operations performed in this setting were included. Cumulative S SI rates varied from 1% for knee arthroplasty to 14% for colon surgery. Post discharge follow -up was completed in >90% of patients at one month for surgeries without an implant and in >80% of patients at 12 months for surgeries with an implant. High rates of SSIs were detected post discharge, from 21% in colon surgery to 93.3% in knee arthroplasty (4). Previous analyses indicated that individual surgical practices constituted a risk for surgical s ite infection (5). Previous reports of the surgical site infections rates have been 8 conducted over longer periods, however, restricted to participating hospitals (6,7) . The prevalence of healt hcare- associated infections in two tertiary and one secondary care hospital was close to 6% (153 infections in 136 of 2'421 patients) was close to the rates reported in other European countries (8) . A report of viral hospital -associated infection frequencies in one infectious disease ward and three general paediatric wards in Finland and Switzerland indicated a frequency of 12%, with 2% of the patients developing an infection in the hospital, most often a gastroenteritis, and 10% within 72 h of discharge. Sharing r oom was a risk factor for hospital -acquired infection (9). Although relatively rare in hospitals clostridium difficile infections, an incidence of 2.3/10,000 patient days was measured in one tertiary care hospital. In the majority of cases, the transmission was from another patient, where age and comorbidity being risk factors (10). Other adverse events Among the other ANQ measures, the rate of potentially avoidable rehospitalisation is measured on the basis of the hospital discharge data s tatistics, these data are collected by the Federal office of statistics. In addition, t he occurrence rates of falls in hospitals as well as the occurrence of decubitus ulcers are also measured on an annual basis. Finally, a register of surgical implants, S IRIS, allows overseeing the safety and effectiveness of the various implanted knee and hip arthroplasties and to detect potential problems related to inferior implant performance ( www.anq.ch ). Using routinely collected hospital discharge data from five countries including Switzerland, the occurrence of in- hospital venous thromboembolism in patients undergoing hip replacement indicated comparatively low rates in Switzerland (<0.5%) that were clos e to an evidence- based benchmark (11). This an example of the Patient Safety Indicators that can be derived from routinely collected hospital discharge data. Several studies have evaluated patient safety in specialised care. The Swiss society of anaesthesia and reanimation introduced Anaesthesia Databank Switzerland (ADS), a voluntary data registry introduced in 1996 and conducted until 2015 (replaced by the A -QUA - CH programme) . The ADS registry analysed routinely recorded adverse events and provided benchmark comparisons between anaesthesia departments. Up to 2010, the database included 2,158,735 anaesthetic procedures. Between 1996 and 2010, 125,579 adverse events were recorded, of which 34% were cardiovascular, 7% respiratory, 39% technical and 20% non -specific. The mos . Appropriateness of care In a prospective cohort of 1260 patients hospitalized for acute coronary syndrome in four tertiary centres, the prescription of recommended preventive drugs was very high (mostly above 90%), although suboptimal for some drugs, allowing thus room for further improvements (13). Among over 45,000 patients with an acute coronary syndrome in the Swiss AMIS ( Acute Myocardial Infarction in Switzerland) registry, a small percentage (<5%) received only palliative care, not taking advantage of the available effective strategies, in absence of obvious rationale (14) . A further analysis of the same AMIS registry data about of treatme nt of an acute coronary syndrome in older adults (13,662 70 years) indicated increased adherence to recommendations between 2001 and 2012 and simultaneous improvement in outcomes, suggesting that increasing use of guideline- recommended therapies was appropriate (15). 9 Opinion and satisfaction Patients' opinion and satisfaction surveys were introduced relatively early in Switzerland comparatively to other quality indicators. Patient satisfaction in hospitals is now included, for about ten years in acute care, in the ANQ set of indicators with, usually, short questionnaires (acute care, psychiatry, rehabilitation and for paediatric care) (www.anq.ch). These results are available on the ANQ website and allow comparisons across hospitals. Many hospitals combine ANQ measures with additional questionnaires. In the framework of an international study that included a cross -sectional survey of nurses (RN4CAST), 1,593 nurses participated in 34 Swiss hospitals; 20% of them reported their ward to have poor or fair q uality of care (i.e., close to the international median value of 23%), whereas 4% gave a poor or failing ward safety grade (i.e., lower than the international median value of 6%), and 15% indicated that patient safety was not a priority of hospital managem ent (16,17) . Patients were highly satisfied in comparison. In the Swiss report of a substudy of this survey, in only 33/120 eligible units did at least 60% of nurses reported a positive patient safety climate. A majority of nurses reported that they were \"consistently engaged\" in only three of the nine proposed patient safety behaviours (18). A survey of 4,311 nurses and nurses' aides in nursing homes indicated that 7% of them rated the quality of care provided as rather low or very low. Important factors related to better quality of care were higher teamwork and safety climate, better staffing and resources adequacy, and low levels of stress due to workload (19). Ambulatory care , general medicine We found only data presented in the following category in ambulatory care. Appropriateness of care The 'Smarter Medicine' campaign began in 2014 with the aim of reducing the prescription of unnecessary care. The \"top five list\" of unnec essary tests and treatments in primary care, such as imaging for acute low -back pain and long- term prescribing of proton pump inhibitors, was released. Responding to an online survey of 277 general practitioners of the 'Swiss primary care active monitoring ' (SPAM) network, 104 (62%) knew of 'Smarter Medicine'. Agreement with the five recommendations was high, with scores around nine out of 10. Over two thirds indicated that they follow each recommendation, except not continuing long- term proton pump inhibit ors prescriptions without attempting dose reduction that followed by only one third (20) . In a study based on routinely collected data of two million insured individuals followed over one or two years, there were 23,129 hospitali sations for ambulatory car e sensitive conditions (i.e., conditions or diseases that could and should be usually treated in ambulatory care - e.g., asthma, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases) during the follow -up period. After excluding 2,829 cases with severe comorbidity justifying the hospitali sation and 2,701 involving a therapeutic operation requiring an inpatient stay, and 550 for both conditions, there were 17,049 potentially avoidable hospitali sations during the follow -up period, corresponding to 6.3 per 1,000 insured, per year. There was an important variation of potentially avoidable hospitalisation rates per canton (from 1.4 to 9.6 per 1,000 insured, per year) (21,22) . The prevalence and determinants of potentially inappropriate medication use, and related hospitalization was measured in a sample of managed care patients aged 65 and older using health care claims data of four health ins urers. The estimated prevalence of potentially inappropriate medication use was above 22% and associated with higher hospitali sation (23). A similar study in over 50,000 patients indicated a slightly higher rate of potentially inappropriate medication delivered by physicians compared to pharmacists (24) . 10 The analysis of potential drug -drug interactions (DDI) in ambulatory care, based on claims data from three large health insurers in 2010, indicated that 1.3% and 1.2% of 1'607'233 female and 1'525'307 m ale patients, respectively, were exposed to potential drug -drug interaction for 12 months. A small proportion of physicians caused potential DDI in a frequency that is very unlikely to be explained by chance when compared to their peers (25). Occasional inquiries In-patient care Other adverse events Postpartum haemorrhage is a relatively common and potentially dangerous obstetric complication. Using data of all patients with deliveries between 1993 and 2014 from the national Swiss Hospital in- patient database for obstetric and gynaecological hospital admissions, an increasing incidence was observed during these two decades (26). On the same topic, a recent analysis in one large hospital indicated a similar trend using hospital discharge data, whereas, including measured blood losses from electronic medical records indicated a decreased secular incidence trend (27) . Ambulatory care, general medicine Other adverse events A large international survey (28) in primary care in 11 countries, conducted in 2013, included over 20'000 patients aged 18 and over, assessing various aspects of primar y care (e.g., access, coordination of care, communication) and potential problems occurring during encounters. Countries differed regarding the proportion of the population experiencing problems with primary care. The mean of self -reported primary care problems was 1.8 in Switzerland, lower than the average of 2.1, but in the mid- range of countries (28) . In a representative population sample of 1306 Swiss citizens, 11% reporte d at least one error in their care in the previous two years, including 5% of medication errors (29). The representative \"Sentinella\" network of primary healthcare physicians evaluated the occurrence of any erroneous event related to the medication process and interfering with normal treatment course, as judged by their physician. The 180 participating physicians detected two medication incidents per gener al practitioner per year (46.5 per 100000 contacts). Higher patient age and morbidity, care by community nurse or by an institution, chronic conditions were risk factors. Most cases were linked to an incorrect dosage for a given patient, while prescripti on of an erroneous medication was the second most common error (30). Appropriateness of care Based on the survey of health, ageing and retirement in Europe (SHARE), polypharmacy, a common condition among the elderly, was assessed in adults aged 65 or more years across 18 countries. The results showed a prevalence of polypharmacy ranging from 26 to 40%. Switzerland was among the countries with the lowest prevalence (26%). Globally, age, gender, number of limitations with activities of daily living, number of chronic diseases, quality of life, depression, physical inactivity, network satisfaction, difficulty in taking medications, years of education and shortage of money were significant variables associated with polypharmacy (31) . 11 Local or regional assessments Routinely collected data We found no studies in this category. Occasional inquiries In-patient care Infection In one academic centre, the baseline figure of an intervention aimed at improving hand hygiene compliance was an observation rate of 66% among 1430 opportunities (32) . Among 5825 urologists surveyed in Austria, Germany and Switzerland, 364 (92%) of 374 respondents, 74% reported non- adherence to guidelines on antimicrobial prophylaxis for low - risk patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate, corresponding to overuses of pre- and postoperative antibiotics. The performance of Swiss urologists was comparable to the practice of their foreign colleagues (33). Other adverse events Several retrospective medical records reviews have been conducted in several countries to assess patient safety (1). These studies have shown substantial rates of adverse events (AE) among hospitalized patients. A similar study was conducted in Switzerland and reported recently. The estimated rate of AE in one acute care hospital indicated that there was at least one AE in 12%, corresponding to one or more preventable A E in 6.4% of hospitali sations (34). In a study on medication errors in one cardiovascular surgery department, 119 nurses used a self-reporting tool during one- month. Out of 987 reports, 288 (29%) indicated that there had been a medication error. Nurses reported preventing 49 (5%) of them, and, overall, eight (3%) had patient consequences (35) . Unintentional paracetamol overdosing is a common medication error in hospitals. All patients who received paracetamol in a tertiary care hospital were analysed to detect cases of paracetamol overdosing using a pharmaco- epidemiological database. From 2011 to 2013, relevant overdosing occurred in 11 patients (5- 8 g/day for 3 to 5 days), corresponding to les s than 1% of all patients exposed to any paracetamol overdosing (mean n = 988 per year) (36). Ten regional acute car e hospitals monitored the discrepancies between drugs prescribed and those prepared for administration, as well as the occurrence of adverse events. The baseline rates in 2010 indicated that pillbox discrepancies were present in 6% of doses; about 1 advers e event per 1000 doses was recorded (37) . In one academic hospital neurology department, drug -related problems were assessed in 1,263 consecutive inpatient cases over 12 months. In 29% of cases one or more drug related problem was present (38) . A survey of pharmacy heads indicated that communication barriers with people of foreign origin are considered a risk for drug related events (39) . A survey of nurses working in oncology depar tments of three hospitals indicated that medication double checking was applied by two thirds of respondents and considered very appropriate to avoid medication errors (40,41) . In another survey of nurses and physicians in oncology, a majority of responders reported at least some episodes of withholding concerns about patient safety. Thirt y-seven per cent said 12 they remained silent at least once when they had information that might have helped prevent an incident (42). Furthermore, the same research team implemented patients' surveys to assess safety; 21% reported at least one definite safety event, and the mean number of 'definite' incidents per patient was 0.31 (29,43) . However, oncology patients seem to underestimate the occurrence and risk of chemotherapy (44) . In addition, the direct participation of patients, to prevent safety adverse events, was considered positive by a majority of the 1141 hospital healthcare professionals who responded to a vignette survey (45) . Between 1972 and 2010, 5,277 consecutive thyroid gland surgeries with 7,383 nerves at risk were performed in one teaching institution. The incidence of permanent recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy in primary operations was significantly higher in the first period (4%) compared to the second period (1%). Permanent hypoparathyroidism decreased from 3% in the first period to 1% in the second period, and the incidence of recurrent goiter surgery decreased from 11% in the first period to 8 % in the second period, i ndicating improvement in techniques and processes (46) . In 143 surgical esophagectomies performed between 2004 and 2013, mostly by two surgeons, postoperative morbidity was 43% that was linked with a five day increase in length of stay (47). Appropriateness of care Number of days spent in acute hospitals at the end of l ife is regarded as an important care quality indicator for cancer patients. Insurance claims data identified 2086 patients as dying of cancer, that indicated a high number of days spent in the hospital in four Swiss cantons compared to most other countries palliative care (48). Moreover, anticancer drug therapy was given in 22.2% and radiotherapy in 11.7% of these palliative care episodes, which questions the appropriateness of these interventions (49). Ambulatory care, general medicine Other adverse events A survey conducted amongst 630 physicians and nurses working in Swis s German primary care offices to determine safety risks and safety climate in their offices indicated that 30 % of the physicians and 17 % of the nurses observed at least one of the 23 survey incidents in their offices on a daily or weekly basis. Errors in documentation were reported most frequently. The study indicated also that telephone triage was a relevant area of patient safety in primary care (50). Among the 630 primary care physicians and nurses, 391 (31%) described 936 threats to patient safety. Errors in diagnosis, drug interactions and compliance of patients were more likely to be cited by physicians, whereas X -rays, confusion of patients or records, hygiene, safety of office rooms and confidentiality were more likely to be described by nurses (39). Appropriateness of care A vignette -based survey investigated the management of outpatients presenting with acute chest pain by 471 general practitioners and 36 cardiologists in private practice. The vast majority responded appropriately to directly refer cases to a close catheter service (88%), or for other selected cases, to an inpatient ward (94%) with no difference between the specialties. Adherence to international guideline was high, although some improvements could be made (51) . A study conducted among all adult patients hospitalized for more than 24 hours in a tertiary care centre and discharged either to their home or to a nursing facility for one month indicated that about two thirds had pain, considered as severe in about half of them. 13 Whereas three quarters indicat ed that treatment definitively relieved pain, less than 5% indicated that it did not (52). In another study conducted among 532 community dwelling adults aged 65 years, the prevalence of potentially inappropriate prescribing was 17% in Switzerland compared to 13% in the Netherlands and 9% in Ireland, whereas potential prescribing omissions was close to 25% in Switzerland and the Netherlands and lower in Ireland (14%). Multimorbidity and polypharmacy wer e more frequently determinants of inappropriate prescription in Switzerland (53). A Swiss pilot survey of 53 general internal medicine practitioners examined the practice of use of the new direct oral anticoagulants showed that only about two- thirds of GPs adhere to recommendations on clinical and blood test follow -ups (54). Quality of preventive healthcare services in primary care was assessed by means of analysing the database of the Swiss \u00abFamily Medicine ICPC Research using Electronic Medical Records\u00bb (FIRE) project. In 2,807 patients with coronary heart disease treated for at least 15 months between 2009 and 2014, the proportion of patients per year meeting four quality indicators (blood pressure and cholesterol targets and prescription of anti -platelet therapy, and recommended drugs for patients with previous myocardial infarction) were above 80% for blood pressure control and in presence of a prior myocardial infarction and above 70% for the two other conditions (55) . However, one should not only evaluate the rate of cardiovascular risks factors control (hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus), but also the related physicians' appropriate response as well as markers of potential overtreatment (21). In four university primary care settings, 20% of patients with hypertension, 41% with dyslipidemia and 36% with diabetes mellitus were in control. When appropriate clinical action in response to poor control was integrated into measuring quality of care, 52 to 55% had appropriate quality of care (21). A survey of 250 primary care physicians with high prescription rates allowed assessing the quality of antibiotic prescribing among 9961 medical records. Overall, antibiotics were prescribed to 32% of patients. For tonsillitis/pharyngitis, acute otitis media, acute rhinosinusitis and acute bronchitis the acceptable maximum of antibiotic prescript ions was exceeded by 24%, 50%, 27% and 12%, respectively. The proportion of non- recommended antibiotics was above the recommended maximum of 20% for all diagnoses (32% -89%). Antibiotic prescribing quality of Swiss primary care physicians with high prescription rates was low, begging for corrective measures (56). Another set of projects investigated quality of care for chronic diseases, mostly in primary care practice, in coordination with respective specialists. Analyses of recommended processes -of-care performed among patients living with diabetes included in a representative cohort study in one canton indicated that, whereas routine tests were performed in over 90% of patients (blood pressure, lipid HbA1C check during the previous year), influenza immuni sation, physical activity and dietary recommendations were less often reported, i.e., in less than two- thirds of patients (57). Of eleven quality -of-care indicators measured in the same patients, three were significantly lower in individuals with lower education achievement, indicating needs for special attention to these patients (58). Similarly, two of seven indicators were lower in those patients with low health literacy (59). In addition, 323 patients of the aforementioned cohort completed a self -administered questionnaire assessing prevalence, awareness and practices regarding eye diseases. Only 70% of participants underwent an eye examination by an ophthalmologist during the previous year , whereas awareness that diabetes could damage the eyes was reported by almost all participants (60) . Another study retrieved information of electronic medical records used by general practitioners (46 practices, 1,781 diabet es patients). Similar results were obtained with very high observance for blood pressure measurement and lower for influenza vaccination diabetes (61). 14 In 604 patients with diabetes included in another cohort study, authors found that the 2013 Swiss S ociety of Endocrinology and Diabetology targets on good disease management in diabetes were achieved in the majority of participants. However, results also highlight areas where disease management can be improved, particularly the role of nutrition counsel ling followed for only about half of the patients (62). Among 295 patients hospitalized for an exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in 19 hospitals in 2011, an overall high standard of adherence to the European the GOLD5 2010 recommendations was observed. Nevertheless, only 79% of the patients received a short -acting bronchodilator at admission, and seven recommendations to improve and standardize the management of acute exacerbation episodes were consecutively proposed (63). A previous study was conducted among 454 COPD treated by 139 general practitioners in 2007 indicated lower adherence to GOLD guidelines (64) . The quality of preventive care was also studied. In 2009, 281 r andomly selected physicians provided data on five consecutive hypertensive patients attending their practices for blood pressure follow -up. Data from 1376 patients were available; overall, blood pressure was controlled in about half patients with uncomplic ated hypertension, but in patients with uncontrolled hypertension a change in drug therapy was made in one third of them only (65) . In a random sample of 1,002 patients aged 50- 80 years followed for 2 years from all Swiss university primary care settings, 69% received recommended preventive care . However, if 83% of patients received recommended care for cardiovascular risk factors, only 35% received recommended c are for the early diagnosis of colon cancer. Prevention indicator rates were lower for women and the elderly, and for cancer screening, thus targeting further quality improvement initiatives (66) . Moreover, despit e universal healthcare coverage, forced migrants receive less preventive care than Swiss patients in university primary care settings (67). Ambulatory care, specialty medicine Appropriateness of care A survey of quality of surveillance after curative surgery for colon cancer among a cohort of 129 stage I -III colon cancer patients compared actual surveillance practice with guidelines recommendations. The recommendations were followed in less than one third of patients pointing on an inadequate surveillance and needs for enhanced practice and monitoring (68). About 200,000 breasts screens were performed between 1999 and 2006 in three long standing Swiss cantonal programmes. Swiss programmes met most European standards of performance with a substantial, favourable cancer stage shift, but indicated desirable adaptation of screening processes (69). A study involving 23 cardiologists and 622 ambulatory patients with atrial fibrillation in private practice in one canton indicated one of the highest appropriate anticoagulant prescription rates reported at the time of the study (70). The Swiss inflammatory bowel diseases study allowed to conduct several analyses of appropriateness of care. In this cohort, 9 out of 10 indications for infliximab therapy in Crohn's disease patients were clinically generally acceptable (appropriate or uncertain) (71). Appropriateness of the first -line biological treatment was determined in 186 patients with ulcerative colitis, for 64% of them, this treatment was considered appropriate (72) . In addition, more than three- quarters of the patients with fistulising Crohn's disease, therapy was globally appropriate (71). 5 Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease 15 The adherence to recommendations for management of early breast cancer was assessed in 3499 women aged 25- 79 years diagnosed with i nvasive breast cancer in 2003- 2005. In one- third of the patients, management met guidelines in all items, whereas in about one -fifth, three or more items did not comply. Treatment by a surgeon with higher caseload was an independent predictor of a high com pliance score (73) . A previous study included all 1404 breast cancer patients operated in the public unit or the private network and recorded at the Geneva Cancer Registry between 2000 and 2005 showed high quality indicators of breast cancer care with both networks (74) . Two studies were achieved using data of cancer registry in canton Ticino. Among 474 colorectal cancers adherence to recommendations was generally positive and encouraging, sometimes more favourable in comparison with other international studies, except the very low proportion of patients with a diagnosis based on opportunistic screening (9%) (75). Adherence to evidence- based quality indi cators for prostate cancer in 700 patients with prostate cancer indicated that guidelines were followed in about two thirds of cases, but active surveillance was performed is less than half of patients (76) . Initiatives and projects to assess quality and safety National initiatives and programmes should allow or promote the regular, annual in general, production of nationwide indicators of healthcare quality and patient safety. FO PH has developed a series of inpatient quality indicators, targeting cute somatic care in Swiss hospitals. These indicators are based on the \"medical hospital statistics\" acute care hospital discharge data and pu blished annually . ANQ measures the aforementioned measured indicators that are also publicly available on its website (www.anq.ch). The monitoring of hospital -acquired infections by the Swissnoso initiative started early, with rates of surgical site infections now included in the mandatory ANQ reporting (www.anq.ch / www.swissnoso.ch / (4). A recent assessment of the structure and quality of surveillance activities of the surgical site infection surveillance program in 147 hospitals showed that, irrespective of a well -defined surveillance methodology, there was a wide variation of surveillance quality, and that the quality of chart review and the accuracy of data collection were main areas for improvement (77) . The Swiss participation to the nurses' RN4CAST survey (16) led to several publications, including methodological papers about the relation between nurses rationing and patient safety (78,79) , and contributed to the awareness of the importance of patient safety in hospitals (80-82). The Swiss participation to the OECD initiative to assess and compare quality and safety indicators ( cf. http://www.oecd.org/els/health -systems/health -care-quality -and-outcomes) indicated the expected methodological difficulties (83) but allowed useful contacts for FOPH. Actually, several international projects allowed the assessment and comparison of quality and safety figures, such as projects coordinated and co -funded by the Commonwealth Fund that analysed quality and coordination of care for elderly patients and patient s with complex situations (84-86) or a project in primary care aimed at describing variability in process quality in family medicine among 31 mostly European countries (87-89). These studies indica ted relatively good results for Switzerland, allowing possibilities for improvement i n primary care and care for individual s living with chronic conditions. Other specialty societies than infectious diseases have also developed initiatives to foster qualit y and patient safety. For instance, several projects have been conducted in anaesthesia such as the former Anaesthesia Data Bank Project (12) and the ongoing A- QUA -CH programme. 16 In addition the Swiss Society for Anaesthesiology and Reanimation has been maintaining a national critical incident reporting system since 1998, with the participation of a minority of Swiss hospitals and a selected reporting of incidents (90) (www.cirsmedical.ch ). Safety climate instruments were developed and adapted to conduct surveys in Switzerland (91) and safety climate was assessed in several st udies. A survey conducted in 10 hospitals indicated a mean of 3.8 for safety climate. i.e. in the mid -range of the scale (92). However, an in- depth study in two hospitals indicated that taking several measures into account and describing safety climate from different perspectives is necessary in order to fully understand differences and trends within groups and to develop interventions addressing the needs of different groups more precisely (93) Evaluations and reviews of quality and patient safety Several evaluations were based on epidemiological approaches, such as cohorts. For instance the evaluation of trends of neonatal surviva l rates in very preterm infants (<32 weeks), that showed improvement between 2000 and 2004, but not after (Ref Berger TM) . Late preterm deliveries were also observed during 11 years in one large academic hospital that indicated no changes over time, and the persistence of complications in non- evidence- based indications (94) . The assessment of the impact of perinatal predictor s and medical centre on the outcome of 6892 very low -gestational -age neonates (< 32 weeks ), from 2002 to 2011, indicated that 85% of the live -born infants survived and 84% of the survivors did not have severe neonatal complications. After adjusting for perinatal factors, the survival of neonates without severe neonatal morbidity was strongly influenced by the m edical centre that treated them (95). A series of projects allowed the development and implementation of assessment of safety culture in different settings . A prospective observational study in 57 intensive care units in Austria, Germany, and Switzerland with self -reporting of medical errors by staff and concurrent assessment of safety climate indicated that for 795 observed patients, a total of 641 errors affecting 269 patients were reported. Enhanced safety climat e apparently contributed to a reduction of medical errors during typical routine processes in intensive care (96,97) . A recently published national survey in acute care hospitals indicated that mortality & morbidity weekly reports have been introduced and are used in the majority of settings, although their structure, format, and procedures should be improved (98) . Surveys have been conducted to monitor safety initiatives such as the introduction of the surgery chec klist (99), motivation to report incidents by nurses and physicians (98,100) . Another sur vey examined how Swiss healthcare risk and quality managers reacts to safety alerts about possibly risky procedures indicated that they were ready or used to disseminate such information but less so to implement institutional changes (101) . A study conducted in 350 dialysed patients from 27 centres, repre senting 14% of the dialysis population in Switzerland, indicated that, using moderately high epoetin doses, 85% of the patients achieved a mean haemoglobin level 11 g/dL. In comparison to European studies of reference, this survey shows a remarkable and c ontinuous control of anaemia in Swiss dialysis centres (102) . In mental healthcare, the projects and evaluation of quality and safety have started later and are still less developed. The opinion and satisfaction of patient is , however , now included in the ANQ reports ( www.anq.ch ), and other assessments are being proposed and discussed (103) . 17 Comments The development of quality and safety indicators has occurred relatively late in Switzerland, comparatively to other developed countries. This review indicated the indicators routinely established by FOPH and other national organisations, nationwide, on the one hand, and multiple developments and studies of various quality, coverage and size, most often conducted locally or regionally, by various stakeholders and researchers, on the other hand. We have summarised key findings in the following Tables, firs t related to the monitoring of quality and patients safety, second to the assessment of quality and safety, and third, briefly, about qualify and safety culture. Assessment of quality and safety o Limited number of routine assessments of quality and safety nationwide Essentially targeting inpatient care Relatively crude assessments (e.g., inpatient quality indicators, patient satisfaction), to be used for surveillance Should lead to further more in depth analyses if considered insufficient o Insufficient use of - validated - indicators based on existing routinely collected data ( e.g., discharge summary statistics, insurance statistics) o Assessment of quality and safety insufficient in ambulatory care No regular, nationwide, assessment Patchy series of unrelated, uncoordinated surveys o No one source of information easily accessible Where all stakeholders could find assessments of quality and safety in the Swiss healthcare system We have found a sizable number of studies reported in close to 150 publ ications that examined quality and safety, however most studies are limited in their coverage and impact, because they have been conducted in one or a few settings, are restrained to one specific intervention, or corresponds at one assessment at a given ti me. Thus, beyond the few indicators of quality and safety that are currently measured repeatedly at the national level, by FOPH and ANQ, there is a need for additional assessment in key areas. For instance, for the highly prevalent chronic diseases. Several studies have monitored quality of treatment of diabetes and COPD, but a wider coverage is needed and other domains need to be covered. Also, many invasive interventions are associated with risks of adverse events and complications that request monitoring . Many initiatives are local in hospitals, or in cantons; quite a few analyses have been conducted in the framework of health services research initiatives and development groups and projects. For instance, several research projects are currently conducted in the framework of the ongoing national SNF research project NFP 74 . They are designed to implement and test novel approaches to assessing quality and safety , in order to improve indicators and measurements. Globally, this review of indicators of quality and safety available in Switzerland over the last decade confirm that quality of care and patient safety are reasonably good in Switzerland. However, the results observed in presence of international comparisons or with acknowledged or evidence- based standards indicate first that the performance is usually not better in Switzerland than in other developed countries, and second that in many areas there is room for further improvement. 18 Status of quality and safety in the Swiss healthcare system o Inpatient care Good monitoring of infection occurrence Control of infection appropriate, although perfectible, especially when r isk is high as in surgery control of infections in hospital settings High risk of infection for some types of interventions (e.g., colon surgery) Occurrence rate of adverse events in hospitals not lower than in most other developed countries Drug related errors, and events, may be comparatively high Most often drug related errors (prescription, delivery) not followed by adverse eve nts o However susceptible to increase if number and qualification of healthcare professionals decrease o Ambulatory care Relatively numerous evaluation of appropriateness of care, when compared to guidelines or standards Relatively good results for prescription of laboratory tests and treatments in presence of chronic diseases e.g., (hypertension, diabetes) Indications of relatively high figure of inappropriate medications Indications of relatively high figure of inappropriate hospitalisation Occurrence of adverse events also in amb ulatory care Drug prescription errors Several reports indicate potential high rates Culture of quality and safety o Insufficiently assessed o Awareness of quality and safety risks probably low In many inpatient settings Also in ambulatory care This review has several limitations. The restriction of the search strategy to PubMed and the date of publication starting from 2008 may have induced a selection of retrieved articles. Moreover, our s earch strategy may have missed several published articles. These limitations could be explained by the limited time and resources available to conduct this rapid review, which should actually be considered as a kind of scoping review from which we extracted information for this report. In addition, many assessments of quality and safety are not conducted as research projects and are thus not published in the healthcare literature. Moreover, we did not asses the quality of the assessments of quality and safety, nor of the studies themselves. Future development should include the increase in coverage of the assessment of quality and safety in the Swiss healthcare system. The national indicators are essentially targeting 19 hospital care. In addition to primary c are ad usual specialty care, more and more interventions, many invasive, are conducted in ambulatory settings. Although national initiatives are ongoing to better cover this crucial field of healthcare, further developments are needed. Further research ax es include the development and evaluation of quality and safety indicators derived from routinely collected data (e.g., hospital discharge summary statistics, insurance statistics, electronic medical records) . For instance, the proposed 11th version of the internat ional classification of diseases (ICD-11) has been developed to better capture quality and safety (104) . The electronic medical record (EMR) may be an interesting sourc e of information. However, implementing techniques such as data and text mining are not easy actually, begging for further developments and testing. Furthermore, the large number of types and brands of EMR do not ease the approach. If ones want to increase the number and coverage of the assessment of quality and safety, this should be done in a parsimonious way, attempting to minimize the time and efforts required from healthcare professionals to transfer the information. This is a formidable challenge indeed. Conclusions Although the quality and safety of the Swiss healthcare system appears good, there are many areas for which we do not have information and many others where we have only patchy data. Only few indicators are available nationally, and we hav e almost no national coverage of the ambulatory and primary care sectors. However, we do have information that indicate that in several areas efforts need to be done to improve quality and safety. The national efforts should be reinforced to allow the development, and evaluation, of valid indicators that could be implemented and evaluated nationwide at a reasonable cost. The indicators should inform the healthcare professionals to help them improve their practice and the healthcare managers and decision makers to adapt the system, the structures and the conditions to allow providing high quality healthcare, with optimal patient safety. This information should also be easily available for the public and the patients. 20 Appendixes Appendix 1 Search strategy for MEDLINE via PubMed ((patient safety indicator*[tiab] OR ACOVE[tiab]) OR ((\"Outcome and Process Assessment (Health Care)\"[ MeSH ] OR \"Quality Indicators, Health Care\"[ MeSH ] OR \"Patient Safety\"[ MeSH ] OR \"Patient ] OR \"Iatrogenic MeSH ] OR \"Intraoperative Complications\"[ MeSH ] OR \"Long Term Adverse Effects\"[ MeSH ] OR \"Medical Errors\"[ MeSH ] OR \"Postoperative Complications\"[ MeSH ] OR patient safety measure*[tiab] OR patient sa fety metric*[tiab] OR quality indicator*[tiab] OR quality metric*[tiab] or adverse drug event*[tiab] OR adverse drug reaction*[tiab] OR adverse event*[tiab] OR adverse outcome*[tiab] OR clinical incident*[tiab] complication*[tiab] associated OR iatrogenic disease*[tiab] error*[tiab] medication event*[tiab] OR sentinel AND database*[tiab] OR cohort[tiab] OR electronic health record*[tiab] OR electronic medical record*[tiab] OR \"observational data\"[tiab] OR registries[tiab] OR (Switzerland[ \"2008/01/01\"[PDat] 21 Appendix 2 Figure 1.

However, there is a lack of overview to what degree patient safety improvement strategies have been implemented in Swiss healthcare and what evidence exists on their effectiveness. To fill this gap we conducted a literature search in six major databases. Inclusion criteria were: peer -reviewed journal articles published in English, German or French between January 2000 and November 2018 that report on the effects of a patient safety intervention or describe the degree to which specific improvement strategies have been implement ed in Swi tzerland. Study quality was assessed using predefined quality indicators. We included 28 studies in this review; eight on implement ation levels in Swiss healthcare and 2 0 on the effects of patient safety interventions. Information on implementation levels of patient safety interventions is highly fragmented. While there have been national surveys on clinical risk management and some more detailed reports on individual patient safety practices, there is no complete picture of patient safety improvement in Switzerland. Most interventions included in this review were implemented in a single unit/department. Common methods to record patient safety measures such as error rates and compliance with standards were retrospective record review, surveys and direct observation. We found indications of positive intervention effects in most studies . However, only few studies used patient outcomes as indicators of effectiveness. In conclusion , large -scale implementation research is requir ed to allow for more rigorous testing of complex interventions to drive patient safety improvement in Switzerland. 3 Introduction Although the incidence of specific types of patient harm is increasingly well known for many healthcare settings and their causes and contributing factors have been studied in detail, full comprehension of effective interventions and their successful and sustainable implementation is still rather limited. Also, little is known about the level of implementation of patient safet y improvement strategies that have been shown to be effective in other contexts and have thus been recommended for implementation throughout healthcare. This issue is not unique to Swiss healthcare and the international patient safety literature contains a number of articles aiming to summarise what is known about effective patient safety improvement and to provide recommendations regarding which patient safety strategies to implement . For example, in 2012, Pham and colleagues1 reviewed key areas of adverse patient care events (i.e. medication errors, healthcare- acquired infections, falls, hand- off errors, diagnostic errors, and surgical errors), their causes and contributing factors, and corresponding error mitigation strategies pointing out evidence supporting their effectiveness. In 2013, Shekelle and colleagues reported on a multi -year project on an evidence- based assessment of patient safety strategies ,2 concluded that enough evidence existed to permit healthcare systems to move ahead and listed patient safety improvement strategies to be recommended for implementation. These reviews aim to inform the decisions of policy makers in healthcare as well as patient safety practitioners by providing the best available evidence for interventions targeting some of the most common patie nt safety concerns. Despite the available knowledge concerning the incidence and causation of adverse events and effective strategies to prevent their occurrence or mitigate their effects, internationally as well as for the Swiss healthcare system, it is not yet known to what degree patient safety strategies have been implemented in Swiss healthcare and what evidence exists on their effectiveness. Aim and focus of this review This literature review addressed this gap and aims to provide an authoritative overview of what published evidence is currently available concerning patient safety improvement in Swiss healthcare. By focusing on intervention strategies specifically targeti ng patient safety improvement (i.e. aiming to reduce adverse events or strengthen those aspects of the healthcare system that help to maintain safety) in the Swiss healthcare system this report explicitly excludes interventions aiming for improved quality of care perceived by patients or efficiency -oriented process improvements to reduce healthcare costs1. The review will further focus on a number of core areas of the international patient safety literature. The rationale for the selection these areas was to set this review apart from drug development studies and drug -related clinical trials and from evidence- reviews on purely clinical interventions such as new surgical procedures or bundle interventions to prevent catheter -associated bloodstream infections or ventilator - 1 This focus was defined during initial discussions of the aim of this review with the scientific lead on the National Report (Charles Vincent and Anthony Staines). 4 associated pneumonia. The mechanisms for integrating this evidence into clinical practice through guidelines and standards for clinical practice are well -established. We also excluded other infection prevention measures such as hand hygiene because there is an extensive literature on the effectiveness and sustainability of interventions in this area. However, international recommendations of patient safety improvement s trategies to be implemented in healthcare comprise additional aspects for which the implementation pathways are less clear; especially when organisational factors are concerned. For example, Shekelle and colleagues2 additionally mention checklists to prevent intra- and postoperative events, interventions related to the medication use process such as medication reconciliation, computerized provider order entry and the use of clinical pharmacists to reduce adverse drug events, team training and the use of simulation exercises , and the use of complementary methods for detecting adverse events or medical errors to moni tor for patient safety problems. Similarly, Pham et al.1 highlight the importance of interventions related to medication safety (i.e. computerized physician order entry systems and clinical decision support systems, bar -coding, standardized ordering and administration, medication reconciliation and the inclusion of pharmacists in rounds), teamwork and safety culture (e.g. interventions such as the Comprehensive Unit -based Safety Program or the TeamSTEPPS training programme) or patient hand- offs (i.e. structured hand- off too ls, optimal hand- off environments). To capture the developments of patient safety improvement in Switzerland in these areas, the focus areas of this report include, but are not restricted to: Interventions to improve the safety of the medication use process Checklists for surgical procedures and interventional diagnostics Rapid -response systems including the use of early -warning scores (Simulation -based) Team Training The review offers an overview of the findings in each area, an assessment of the study quality , recommendations for further research and recommendations of future initiatives that would enhance patient safety in Swiss healthcare. Methods Definition of central concepts Patient safety. For the purposes of this review, we define patient safety as \"the avoidance, prevention, and amelioration of adverse outcomes or injuries stemming from the process of healthcare\" following the definition by Vincent3. Interventions to improve patient safety. For the purposes of this review, we define interventions to improve patient safety as the implementation of any systematic change of practice at any level of a healthcare organisation. This comprises interventions such as the implementation of clinical risk management practices aimed at learning fr om incidents (e.g. incident reporting, morbidity & mortality meetings), educational interventions to improve skills of healthcare professionals or to raise the awareness of 5 healthcare professionals and patients of patient safety issues and practices, stand ardisation efforts for safety -critical care processes and procedures. This does not include clinical improvements such as, for example, new surgical procedures, new formulation of drugs, new imaging technology. We also excluded infection prevention becaus e this is the focus of a short report commissioned as part of the national report. Rationale for key methodological decisions Limiting search window to year 2000 onwards. After the hallmark report of 'To err is human' pointed out the need for a comprehens ive approach to patient safety improvement in 19994, there has been a growing awareness of patient safety issues around the globe. Subsequently the field of patient safety emerged as an active, interdisciplinary research domain first addressing mainly the detection and systematic analysis of adverse events and later, the development of systematic improvement approaches and the testing of their effects on patient care. Corresponding to this development, the scienti fic publications on patient safety increased abruptly and steadily from the year 2000 onwards5. While other important foundational work of patient safety had been carried out before this date, the term \"patient safety\" started being used more consistently in the publications. For these reas ons we decided to limit our search to publications from 2000 onwards. Approach to limiting the search to Swiss healthcare. Since this review explicitly focuses on patient safety improvement in Swiss healthcare we were only interested in studies reporting on data collected in Switzerland. While this may comprise studies where data was collected in more than one country, the data of the Swiss sample had to be identifiable in the results to allow for any kind of conclusion for Swiss healthcare. An initial sea rch showed that authors of relevant studies used many different ways of reporting the origin of their data such as stating the language region, the canton(s), the city or the name of the healthcare institution, network of healthcare institutions or simulat ion/training centre involved in the study. Also, in some studies none of this information was included in the title, abstract or keywords of the publication. We therefore decided to use the author affiliation as a search field as it is likely that no study would be conducted in Swiss healthcare without the involvement of at least one local researcher. This strategy, however, revealed another challenge. With the World Health Organization (WHO) based in Geneva, Switzerland, this search strategy would lead to a huge number of hits referring to studies conducted in other regions of the world and to policy documents. However, as it is unlikely for a study conducted in Swiss healthcare not to involve at least one other author affiliated to an organisation within S witzerland, it was considered reasonable to exclude author affiliations to the WHO from our search. Screening of references instead of applying more restrictive search terms. A key decision when defining the aims of this review was to exclude purely clinical interventions (e.g. studies targeting specific diseases, studies evaluating the effects of new surgical techniques, new scanning devices, novel applications of existing dr ugs and studies assessing the safety and tolerability of new drugs). However, excluding all these areas of intervention by restricting the search terms did not appear feasible; 6 especially as some patient safety programs include clinical as well as non- clinical components. Given that the number of references identified with the wider search was not excessive, we decided to systematically screen references applying these exclusion criteria. Inclusion and exclusion criteria We included studies recording the e ffects of any kind of intervention on healthcare outcomes related to patient safety such as: a) objective indicators of patient safety (e.g. morbidity -mortality data), b) reported or observed indicators of unsafe care practices (e.g. medication errors, key diagnostic or treatment tasks not performed), c) reported or observed indicators of safe care practices (e.g. adherence to protocols and guidelines) and d) subjective patient safety ratings performed by experts (e.g. assessments of clinical performance during a specific procedure). We further included research articles reporting on the level of implementation of patient safety practices (i.e. the degree to w hich a specific approach to address patient safety issues has been adopted throughout Swiss healthcare) . We excluded studies using safety climate measures as a substitute outcome, assessing other components of the quality of patient care based on the definition by the WHO of quality of care (i.e. \"the extent to which health care services provided to individuals and patient populations improve desired health outcomes. In order to achieve this, health care must be safe, effective, timely, efficient, equitable and people- centred\") or staff outcomes that may adversely impact on patient safety such as burnout. Search strategy We searched six databases (CINAHL, Embase, Medline, Psyndex, Science direct, Web of Knowledge) for research articles published in peer -reviewed journals between 2000- 2018 (search date November 19, 2018) in English, French or German. In order to obtain all relevant results, we applied rather broad research strategy. We used \"patient safety\" as the main search term and restricted our search to articles published by at least one author with a Swiss affiliation excluding \"World Health Organization\" or \"WHO\" as an affiliation. Screening and selection procedure Since the research strategy had been rather broad, we first screened the meta- data and then the titles, abstract and keywords of all references applying a number of screening strategies. Two raters (TM and either JB or JS) then independently screened all retained references of research articles published in peer -reviewed journals in either English, French or German. At the first stage, we screened the title and abstract to identify studies describing an intervention to improve patient safety in any healthcare setting in Switzerland. Disagreements between raters at this stage led to inclusion. At 7 the second stage, we reviewed the remaining full texts to select those studies a) reporting on the effects of the intervention drawing on either qualitative or quantitative data and b) describing the level of implementation of a patient safety improvement strategy. Disagreements between TM and any of the other raters at the second stage were resolved by consensus discussion. Data extraction For all intervention studies we extracted a brief description of the intervention, the scope (i.e. pilot application, unit/department, organisation- wide, regional, national), the method applied including the patient safety measure(s), study setting, sample and participants as well as the main results focusing on the findings reported on the patie nt safety measure(s) but also including other relevant findings. Data extraction was performed by JB and JS and double- checked by TM. Rating of study quality Since the intervention studies included in this review were not only randomized controlled trials but covered a range of study designs, we did not employ the GRADE system6 usually r ecommended for assessing the quality of evidence for clinical guidelines. Instead, we assessed the study quality, using a rating system that was a slightly adapted version of the one proposed by Buckley and colleagues.7 Because of the importance of external validity for study quality, we replaced the single item used by Buckley and colleagues with two items from a checklist by Downs and Black .8 Further, we added three items specific to intervention studies from Downs and Black, leaving out the item on triangulation because the focus of this review was on the effect of the intervention and we did not necessarily expect authors of intervention studies to triangulate multiple methods. For the complete set of items used to evaluate study quality including the origin of each item as well as a brief description of all quality indicators see Table 2. Each item was rated by either JB or JS as '0' (not fulfilled), '0.5' (partially fulfilled) or '1' (complete) . We rated an item as 'not mentioned' (i.e. relevant information not explicitly provided so that it cannot be assessed whether or not the cri terion has been fulfilled) or as 'not applicable' if it was considered not relevant for the specific study . A random sample of four studies was rated independently by JS and JB to assess rater agreement . We achieved consistency of 91%. Disagreements between raters were due to different interpretations of the information provided in the included articles. We perform ed no quality assessment of the studies describing the implementation levels of patient safety practices in Swiss healthcare because these studies were qualitative or purely descriptive. 8 Results Search and screening results As summarized in Figure 1 our search obtained 3368 references of which 3062 were retained after removal of duplicates. Screening the meta- data of these references we further removed non- research articles (e.g. commentaries, editorials), study protocols, reviews, abstracts or proceedings of conferences (n=269) and references not listing an author (n=73). Screening the titles and abstracts of the remaining 2720 references, we removed another 622 that reported data from other countries, always retaining those studies that only reported to have been conducted in Europe, or international studies that either did not specify the participating countries or mention inclusion of a Swiss healthcare organisation or patient sample. After excluding drug studies (e.g. focusing on pharmacokinetics or drug tolerability) and references reporting data on a specific illness (e.g. diabetes or coronary disease) 1158 references were retained for independent screening. After both stages of i ndependent screening, a final set of 2 0 studies reporting on the effects of interventions to improve patient safety in a Swiss healthcare setting and eight articles, reporting on the level of implementation of patient safety improvement strategies that have been shown to be effective in other contexts, were retained for detailed analysis. Figure 1. Systematic literature search and record selection Records identified through database searching (n = 3368) Records after removal of duplicates (n = 3062) Record meta-data screened (n = 3062) Records excluded (n = 342) Reasons for exclusion: Non- research articles (n = 269); no author listed (n = 73) Full-text articles assessed for eligibility (n = 101) Full-texts excluded (n = 73) Studies reporting on the effects of patient safety interventions (n = 20) Studies reporting on implementation levels of patient safety practices (n = 8) References screened for eligibility (n = 2720) References excluded (n = 1562) Reasons for exclusion: Country not Switzerland (n = 622); reporting on specific illness or drug study (n = 940); Other (n = 1057) 9 Level of implementation of patient safety improvement strategies This review identified eight studies reporting in some form on the level of implementation of one or more strategies to improve patient safety in Swiss healthcare.9-16 While this excludes studies assessing only knowledge of attitudes towards these practices, some studies did incorporate both aspects.11,13,15 One of the included studies reports on data of a national survey on Clinical Risk Management (CRM) practices in the hospital sector conducted in 2007/20089. This survey provides an overview of the stages of implementation for a range of CRM practices such as incident reporting, use of simulation- based training or error disclosure based on the transtheoretical model17 (i.e. \"Not yet examined\", \"Examined, but so far no implementation plan\", \"Implementation planned the next 12 months\", \"Not systematically implemented\", \"Systematically implemented/Deliberate decision against implementation\").18 The results of this survey provide a good starting point for more detailed investigations into specific CRM practices. This study also identified three key enablers fostering CRM implementation: establishing a central role for CRM coordination, assuring dialogue with and between the departments/services, and developing strategic CRM objectives.9 In the following, we briefly summarise studies describing the implementation of individual strategies for patient safety improvement in Switzerland. For the intervention studies included in this review, their level of implementation is described in the fol lowing section of this report and included in Table 1. Three studies investigated implementation of checklists in the context of surgical safety .10,11,13 Cullati and colleagues11 analysed a rather small sample of 152 responses (response rate 35.1%). Of these, 64.7% reported use of a checklist similar to the one recommended by the WHO with reported compliance rates being higher to sign- in and time-out than for sign- out. In another study using observation to evaluate compliance during time- out and sign -out, Cullati and colleagues10 found that checklist compliance (i.e. whether an item was chec ked) was 84% for time- out and 58% for sign- out while validation (i.e. confirmation of the checked items by at least one other team member was rather unsatisfactory with 50% and 41%, although slightly improved in high- risk procedures. In a later survey addr essing a larger population, Mascherek and colleagues13 found that of the 1378 respondents to the survey (23.3% response rate), 1090 (79.1%) repor ted the use of a surgical checklist. Of these, 532 (38.6%) used the Swiss Patient Safety Foundation recommendations to avoid wrong site surgery based on the Universal Protocol, 346 (25.1%) used the WHO -checklist and 212 (15.7%) used other checklists. Another three studies addressed strategies for learning from error with one of them focusing on morbidity and mortality (M&M) conferences ,16 one on incident reporting systems12 and one on the uptake of sa fety alerts15. Praplan- Rudaz and colleagues16 conducted a national survey on the implementation status of M&M conferences in Swiss hospitals in which 321 chief physicians from a range of disciplines participated (35.2% response rate). 69.5% indicated that M&M conferences were currently conducted in their department, usually quarterly, and the majority of other respondents indicated considering implementation. In their cross -national comparison between Swiss and 10 German hospitals Manser and colleagues12 provide a descriptive charact erisation of IRS implemented in the two countries and identify context factors such as hospital type and the existence of a central role for CRM coordination and of strategic CRM objectives (both identified a success factors before)9 that influence the ways in which IRS are implemented. Finally, Pfeiffer and colleagues15 report on the uptake of national safety alerts based on a sample of 116 healthcare quality and risk managers (response rate 39%). The study showed that participants used the alerts strategically to support their own patient safety agenda but did not feel responsible for dissemination or incorporation of their content into improvement programmes within their organisations. A survey on error disclosure standards in Swiss hospitals conducted in 2011 extended the information available from the previous surveys on Clinical Risk Management practices that had only asked for disclosure of errors leading to patient harm.14 The st udy showed that 62% of the 205 participating hospitals (54% response rate) either had an internal hospital standard on open disclosure (46%) or planned to implement one within a year (16%). This study also revealed significant association between hospital type and the implementation of error disclosure with psychiatric, rehabilitation and specialty clinics being significantly more likely to have no error disclosure standard (53%) than university and acute care hospitals (25%); 2(1, n=183) =15.55, p <0.001. Interventions to improve patient safet y in a Swiss healthcare setting For an overview of the 20 intervention studies included in this review see Table 1. These interventions cover all the pre- defined focus areas of this review but also go beyond this focus (e.g. an organisational intervention of merging two dispatch centres or an intervention to ensure adequate staffing during patient transport). Publication dates. The earliest of these studies was published in 200619 and most studies (N=5) appeared in 2016.20-24 Healthcare setting. All but one study , which investigated the effects of a merger of two emergency dispatch centres25 were designed for a hospital environment with one study reporting on data collected in a simulated surgical setting26. Scope . Most interventions included in this review have been implemented at the unit or department level.19-22,27- 34 One of these studies investigated the effect of a national working time directive for residents but used data from a single department .30 Organisation- wide implementation was reported in five studies: three investigated team training interventions28,35,36, one the WHO Surgical Safet y Checklist10 and one the merger of two emergency dispatch centres25. Only one study which included four intensive care units was located at the regional leve l37 and one study including ten hospitals was considered as \" national level \".24 The remaining studies were considered pilot implementations of educational interventions ,23,26 although for many other studies there was also no information available on the continuation of the intervention after the study had been completed. 11 Table 1.

During the initial period, 31% and 56% of transfers requiring an accompanying nurse/ physician according to the algorithm, were accompanied by a nurse /physician. During the first and second evaluation period, 100% and 93% of transfers requiring an accompanying nurse were accompanied by a nurse. For accompanying physicians the respective v alues were 38% and 35%. 2. Percentage of perceived unsafe transfers decreased from 6% to 4%. 20% of transfers considered safer than necessary. Other findings: Over study period the number of transfers increased by 40%, percentage of patients requiring equipment decreased from 34% to 14%, oxygen and drug requirement remained stable. 13 0 Zimmermann et al. 201536 Intervention: Team and resuscitation training programme (iSTaRT) using inter -professional in- situ simulation as an educational strategy Scope : organisation- wide (i.e. across several hospital departments) Method: Cross -sectional survey Patient safety measure: 1. Self -perceived impact and self -efficacy after every training session 2. Training needs bas ed on assessment of team performance with TeamMonitor after simulation and real emergencies during study period 3. Identified latent safety threats and system changes Setting: Lucerne tertiary children's hospital (emergency department, ICU and intermediat e care) Sample: 95 simulation training participants Participants: nurses and physicians of participating departments 1. Self -reported improvement in teamwork 99%, technical skills 80%, knowledge 90% and anxiety 76% 2. Items for which urgent training need w as identified: Team member understanding of his/her role, verbalisation of team member activities, and repeating back or paraphrasing instructions and clarifications to indicate that they were heard correctly 3. 23 different latent safety threats detected during the iSTaRT sessions (1.1 per session) and following real events (1.4 per event) 13 0 * Scope : pilot application, unit/department, organisation- wide, regional, national 17 Methods and patient safety measures. The most frequently applied method to collect information on the patient safety measures was retrospective record review (8 out of 20 studies) followed by surveys (6 studies) and direct observation (5 studies). Across the 20 intervention studies, the most common patient safety measure were errors such as prescription errors, errors during medication preparation, or under -triage (9 studies), followed by compliance with or adherence to procedural guidelines and checklists (7 studies). Morbidity and mortality (M&M) dat a were analysed in two studies and clinical performance was assessed in two studies. Two studies assessed learning as a result of the intervention with one study additionally capturing latent safety threats identified during the intervention. One study analysed meeting notes from M&M conferences for their content and interventions derived from the conference discussion. Focus area \"Interventions to improve the safety of the medication use process\". Our review identified seven studies aiming to improve safet y at various stages of the medication use process. These interventions aimed for standardised performance of key tasks such as taking a medication history during patient interviews20,29 as well as tools to support standardised task performance.19,27,29,32 One study describes a change in workplace layout (i.e. the introduction of separate medication preparation rooms) to minimise interruptions during safety -critical tasks.22. While most of these studies targeted a rather narrow window in the medication use process and consisted of one interventional component, the study by Pagnamenta and colleagues describes a more com plex 24- month improvement project in the intensive care setting that led to significantly reduced risk of medication errors.37 Their intervention combined several procedural and equipment -oriented components: a) basic electronic prescription without clinical decision support tools, b) standardi sed labeling of continuously infused medications, c) identical models of perfusors/infusion pumps, and d) part -time pharmacist involvement to check all electronic prescriptions for drug -dosing adjustments for hepatic and/or renal dysfunction, drug interactions, and compatibility checking of the patient's intravenous medications.37 Focus area \"Checklists for surgical procedures and interventional diagnostics\". Our review identified three studies investigating interventions aiming at standardised procedures for the checking of safety cri tical information before, during and after surgical procedures and interventional diagnostics.10,24,31 Two of these studies assessed the checklist performance rather than their effects on patient care and patient outcomes. During their observations, Cullati and colleagues found high compliance rates with less validation of checklist items during sign- out.10 Mascherek and colleagues found a significant increase in self -reported frequency of use of the checklist in a national programme as well as improved knowledge about and satisfaction with checklist use.24 Only the study by L\u00fcbbeke and colleagues who found an effect on patient outcome measures with a significant reduction in reoperation rates due to surgical side infections.31 All other outcome measures showed no significant change. Another two studies also employed a procedural standardisation approach but were limited to a pre- induction checklist for the anaesthesia team rather than the information exchange on safety -critical aspects among the theatre team . Tscholl and colleagues34 found no statistically significant effect on clinical performance but on team -level outcomes such as knowledge of safety -critical information and perception of teamwork 18 and safety. Kandler and colleagues found a positive effect of a video- based educational approach to increase protocol adherence focusing on the performance of safety -critical tasks.23 Focus area \"Rapid -response systems including the use of early -warning scores\". Our review identified no studies evaluating the effects of introducing a rapid- response system or medical emergency teams in a Swiss hospital setting. Also, we were unable to identify empirical evidence on the introduction or use of early -warning scores (EWS) to detect deteriorating patients at an early stage. These two findings are interdependent because EWS are frequently part of a rapid response system. EWS support clinical staff in the peripheral wards in identifying patients that could benefit from advanced care by a medical emergency team to prevent further deterioration possibly leading to a medical emergency and (re- )admission to a unit that provid es a higher level of care. Focus area \"(Simulation- based) Team Training\". Our review identified three studies investigating team training interventions with very different aims for improvement.26,28,36 The study by Rosenthal and colleagues showed a positive training effect concerning surgical trainees' technical performance.26 However, this study should be considered a pilot study because the intervention was not implemented within the organisation. In contrast, the study by Haller and colleagues was implemented for all members of the obstetrics team in a large hospital but used only self -report data to evaluate the effects on participants' learning instead of more objective indicators of team performance or patient safety.28 The study by Zimmermann and colleagues found positive training effects concerning technical and non- technical aspects of performance, but again us ed self-report s.36 In addition, this study reports on the detection of latent safety threats detected during the simulation sessions that have led to system changes in the participating unit. Other interventions. In addition to the focus areas of this review , we identified several other intervention studies conducted in a Sw iss healthcare context. Two studies targeted triage performance based on predefined criteria of patient requirements and associated risks. One study showed a positive effect of a merger of two emergency dispatch centres on avoiding under - or over -triage of patients25 and one intervention showed improvements in patient transfers being performed according to predefined requirements (e.g. concerning accompanying staff member category).35 One study investigating the effects of the 50- hour working time restriction found no effects on the frequency of medical complications intra- and post -operatively, but contrary to the intended effects a higher post -operative surgical complication rate and higher in- hospital mortality after the intervention.30 Only one study focused on learning from incidents by investigating M&M conferences and the interventions derived from these conferences.21 While there is no direct link to improved patient outcomes there is a clear effect on the understanding and management of safety problems at the local level. Finally, one study evaluating a patient safety advisory found that patients in the intervention g roup were less likely to experience adverse incidents but no change in the performance of safety - relevant behaviours.33 Study quality. For each study, the overall score resulting from the quality rating is included in Table 1. The rating of all items for each study is provided in Appendix 1 . In general, study quality was found to be high ( M=12.45, SD=1.02) with ratings ranging 19 from 10 to 14 out of 15 possible points. Table 2 gives a detailed overview of how many studies fulfilled each quality item and indicat es strengths and weaknesses in the field. Overall, research questions were clearly stated, data collection methods and analyses were appropriate and the conclusions were clearly justified in all included studies. All studies were rated as reproducible and carried out with adequate samples resulting in high external validity. Five studies did not mention ethical issues in the text. However, we do not think that these issues were not addressed, but were not reported in the published article. We would like to highlight three weaknesses that were prevalent in the intervention designs. First and most importantly, long -term effects of the studied interventions were only assessed in two studies using additional follow -up measurement .28,35 One study partially fulfilled this aspect with multiple post -measures but over a short period of time19. Second, only half the studies adequately included control variables in their design. This presents a significant limitation for intervention studies. Third, only four studies used a design with a clear treatment and control group. The majority of studies (N=13) used a pre- post design which we rated as partially fulfilled (0.5 points), since this design is more likely to be affected by confounding variables that occur during the intervention period (e.g. other hospit al wide changes or campaigns, increasing experience of participants over time). 20 Table 2: Overall results for each quality indicator to assess study quality Quality indicator Short description Reference for source of item No. of studies with item fulfilled No. of studies with 'not mentioned' or 'not applicable ' Research question Is the research question or hypothesis clearly stated? 7 20 (all) 0 Data collection Are the methods used reliable and valid for the research question and context? 7 20 (all) 0 Analysis of results Are the statistical or other methods of results analysis used appropriate? 7 20 (all) 0 Conclusion Is it clear that the data justify the conclusions drawn? 7 20 (all) 0 Reproducibility Could the study be repeated by other researchers? 7 20 (all) 0 External validity 1 Were those subjects who were prepared to participate representative of the entire population of investigation? 8 20 (all) 0 External validity 2 Were the places and facilities where the study was executed, representative of a real medical environment?

In the following we provide a summary and critical reflection of the key findings of this review and make recommendations for future initiatives to enhance patient safety in Swiss healthcare. Knowledge of implementation levels in Swiss healthcare In Switzerland, as in other countries, surveys on the implementation of specific pat ient safety practices have been conducted.9-16 These studies indicate moderate levels of adoption and do not allow for an evaluation of the overall approach to patient safety improvement due to a limited focus. Also, some of these studies were investigated at the level of healthcare organisations while others had a specialty or care setting focus. For ex ample, one study not identified by our search strategy because only indexed in German and French, reports on the level of implementation of incident reporting in Swiss intensive care based on a survey conducted in 2004.40 65% of participating intensive care units indicated to use incident reporting. The study reports higher than average adoption and thus points at differences between care settings in terms of involvement in patient safe ty initiatives. However, since no data exists on the actual distribution and the data is already more than ten years old, this statement should be interpreted with caution. Apart from these narrowly focused surveys, two national surveys on CRM in hospitals were conducted in 2007/0841 and 201042 providing a descriptive overview of the maturity reached for different patient safety practices at the national level and allowing for an identification of success factors or enablers for CRM implementation.9 These enablers can be seen as leading indicators making successful implementation more likely and thus provide guidance for the hospital leadership. On the one hand, having conducted these surveys sets Swiss healthcare apart from many other countries . Only Germany has publis hed findings from a comparable national survey in 201043 and 201544 allowing at least in part for a cross -national comparison.12 On the other hand, the potential of these surveys to guide and monitor national patient safety improvement initiatives has not been utilised. The second CRM survey conducted in 201042 explicitly aimed to evaluate the requirements for implementing a continuous national monitoring system for CRM practices in Switzerland. However, so far no funding has been made available to establish such a monitoring system. Interventions to improve patient safety in a Swiss healthcare setting This review found evidence for three of the four predefined focus areas and, given the small size of Switzerland, we were rather surprise by the number of studies included in this review . The most frequent type of i nterventions included in this review aimed to improve the safety of the medication use process. This finding is not surprising given that medication safety has been an international patient safety priority for many years and that many studies have looked into the types and causes of medication- related adverse events in Swiss healthcare.45,46 All interventions included in this review achieved 23 significant reductions in medication errors. However, some of them focused on single steps of the medication use process in a specific care setting thus limiting their impact. Only one study described a complex multi -facetted intervention project that could serve as a model for other care environments.37 However, it has to be noted that the patient safety measure used in this study was less objective than the record review data used in other studies. Another intervention that has the potential for wider application is a change in workplace layout to minimise interruptions during safety -critical tasks.22 While it may be difficult to introduce separate medication preparation rooms in existing units, alternative interventions such as the wearing of safety vests showed promising results in terms of reduced interruption rates in an init ial evaluation.47 However, this last study had to be excluded from this review as no patient safety measure was recorded. We reviewed three interventions that introduced c hecklists for surgical procedures10,24,31 and two for anaesthesia.23,34 No studies reporting on similar interventions for other invasive procedures or interventional diagnostics were identified bin this review . The evaluation was limited to compliance with checklist use and adherence to the checklist items in all studies exc ept for the one by L\u00fcbbeke and colleagues.31 Given the strong focus of surgical societies internationally and in Switzerland on implementation of checklists for surgical procedures, it can be assumed that it is more widely established than indicated by this review. However, the positive effects on c linical performance, teamwork and communication during the procedure, improvements in post -operative care and patient outcomes documented by other studies48-50 are not well documented for the Swiss healthcare context. This review identified only limited evidence on the effectiveness of (simulation -based) team training interventions in Swiss healthcare. All three studies grouped into this category made use of simulation technology26,28,36 with one focusing more on individual technical skills than on team aspects .26 The limited number of studies makes it difficult to assess the level of evidence in this area. However, our finding that positive effects were found mainly on teamwork -related aspects instead of patient outcomes, that evaluations were based on surveys instead of changes in patient care and that follow - up measures were not used consistently is in line with much of the international literature. Given that Switzerland has been one of the first countries in Europe to adopt simulation - based team training with the Department of Anesthesiology at the University Hospital Basel introducing patient simulators for research and training purposes in 199451,52, it is a rather surprising finding that the evidence on simulation- based team training interventions in Swiss healt hcare is this limited . Also, some very active research groups studying team performance in acute care settings are based in Switzerland and have contributed significantly to the literature underpinning team training in these settings.53-61 Given this background, we would have expected the number and quality of team training research to be higher. In this review, we identified no publications that evaluate other team training formats such as the internationally widely used approach TeamSTEPS.62,63 This contrast between a widespread use of at least some form of simulation- based team training in Swiss hospitals and the lack of published reports might be due to the methodological challenges of training hospital staff. There is pertinent evidence coming 24 from meta -analys es and reviews that team training has a positive effect on attitudes, learning and behaviour.64,65 It can be assumed that this change then positively influences patient safety. However, there is insufficient evidence to support long-term impacts. It i s difficult to implement a comprehensive team training initiative reaching a majority of hospital staff. Compared to interventions targeting processes or tools (e.g. checklists, reporting systems) team training is often much more time and resource intensiv e and evaluations would require even more resources. Therefore, robust evidence is still scare. Future patient safety initiatives in Switzerland need to take on the challenges of rigorous testing of team training interventions including adequate controls and follow -up measurement to assess their long-term effects on patient outcomes. While this review did not find empirical evidence on the effects of introducing rapid - response systems in a Swiss hospital setting with or without the use of early -warning scores (EWS), there are indications that this patient safety improvement strategy is starting to be considered. In 2017, the Swiss Academy of Medical Sciences launched a research project to develop recommendations for the implementation, necessary adaptions, and use of EWS in Swiss hospitals. The project consisted of two sub- studies: a) assess chief physicians' knowledge and attitudes towards EWS as well as the perceived need for introducing EWS and b) pilot EWS in one Swiss hospital. The main findings of the first study have been published66 and showed limited knowledge of EWS - systems (43.2% of responding chief physicians) with only 20.3% reporting use of such systematic assessment tools. Given the 33% response rate of the survey this can be interpreted as rather low; especially in light of a 93.2% agreement with the statement that unnoticed clinical deterioration of patients is a problem for patient safety and the evidence from other countries on the positive effects on morbidity and mortality67,68 by avoiding the so- called \"failure to rescue\" .69 There are some apparent gaps in the spectrum of interventions and research approaches to assess their effectiveness identified by this review. First, i n line with much of the research on the prevalence of adverse events in healthcare and the factors contributing to their occurrence or mitigation, the interventions included in this review were almost exclusively developed for the hospital setting. The lac k of improvement approaches targeting primary care settings may reflect that patient safety research has addressed this setting much later but also that primary care is much more decentralised and thus requires different measurement approaches and collabor ative implementation approaches. For example, Goetz and colleagues70 conducted a longitudinal study in Swiss primary care showing the benefits of the systematic implementation and repeated measurement of the European Practice Assessment tool on a range of measures including quality and safety. Specifically, they found significant improvements concerning process -oriented outcomes such as \"complaint management\", \"analysis of critical incidents\", \"quality development, quality policy\" and \"detection of quality and safety problems\". While this study did not investigate effects on patient outcomes, the findings are in line with those of other studies indicating that a systematic, strategically guided approach9 and collaboration among healthcare professionals in implementing this approach, contribut es to improvements in established indicators of the quality and safety of care.71 Another study in primary care investigated the effects of quality circles between general practitioners and pharmacists finding positive long -term effects concerning cost efficienc y.72 This points at the relevance of 25 boundary -spanning interventional approaches to fully utilize the complementary expertise of other disciplines and bridge the gaps between healthcare settings. While both studies were not included in this review for reasons discussed beforehand with the scientific lead, they provide valuable sources of information on interventional approaches or successful implementation strategies. Second, the methodological approaches sometimes limit the value of the information gained from the studies included in this review. T he patient safety measures used to evaluate the interventions included in this review were sometimes limited to proxy measures with only two studies using actual patient outcome data. The most frequently used patient safety measures were error rates and compliance. This finding is related to the large proportion of reviewed interventions that aimed for standardisation and introduced technological systems, especially along the medication use process, to enforce standardised task performance. While the detection of medication errors in patient records can easily be broken down into different types of errors using internationally established classification systems, they do not provide information on the ways in which the intervention contributed to the observed error reduction or, in case of no intervention effect, what might have prevented this. This discussion is not unique to studies in Swiss healthcare and is gaining importance when aiming to evaluate complex patient safety interventions.73 Further, we observed that most studies used a pre- post- test design which is more likely to be affected by confounding variables than a design using a treatment and control group. Also, the long -term effects of the interventions were not adequately address ed. Although these two design features will increase the complexity of future intervention studies this will result in more robust data, allow for an understanding of the mechanisms behind the effects and learn more about the sustainability of patient safety interventions. Third, many of the interventions identified in this review targeted a specific procedural step (e.g. medication history taking) instead of multi -facetted complex interventions to improve patient safety. O ur review found no attempt of addr essing organisation- or system -wide issues underpinning many patient safety problems such as a safety - oriented design of the work environment, managerial strategies such as the composition of healthcare teams (for example concerning the skill grade mix74) and organisational factors impacting on healthcare providers' health75-77 through targeted interventions. While this is in line with some of the patient safety practic es recommended for implementation1,2, that are often focused on clinical aspects (e.g. bundle interventions to prevent central -line associated bloodstream infections) and were excluded from this review. Recommendations for m onitoring of improvement efforts and implementation research As indicated by this review, the scientific literature does not provide a sufficient basis for understanding the level of implementation as well as the barriers and facilitators of successful and sustainable implementation of patient safety improvement. On e possibility would be the continuation of the CRM survey to monitor implementation of patient safety practices at a national level to understand the maturity level of participating organisations and identify support needs. Such a national monitoring syste m would have to be embedded in a sustainable system for regularly updating the 26 content based on new developments in the patient safety literature and linked to strategic goals to drive national safety programmes. Internationally the focus of patient safet y research has shifted towards improvement and implementation science and many countries have begun to address the lack of progress at a national level. Such an approach requires leadership based on a strategic plan for patient safety improvement at the na tional level. Internationally recommended patient safety improvement strategies should be encouraged2 and the evaluation of their implementation sho uld be a requirement. For example, given the evidence on patient harm resulting from inadequate management of deteriorating patients, medical societies need to make the combined introduction of rapid- response systems including the use of early -warning scor es a focus of their patient safety initiatives. In implementing and evaluating these strategies , the need for adaptation to Swiss healthcare should be addressed explicitly to facilitate wider dissemination. While the national quality improvement programmes in Switzerland have partially addressed this issue, the duration of comparable projects in other countries has been considerably longer78 and substantial research funding was made available to evaluate not only short -term effects. A deeper understanding of the barriers and facilitators to implement and sustain change is requi red to get more than just pilot projects that are not sustainable without the external funding . The involvement of front -line staff responsible for implementing improvements are critical to avoid that initiatives are abandoned shortly after their introduct ion.79 Also, implementation research has pointed out the relevance of organisational readiness80,81 and culture79,82 for the acceptance and continued suppor t of improvement efforts. Finally, t his review found patient safety improvement efforts in Swiss healthcare to be concentrated on the hospital sector. Thus, patient safety improvement efforts need to expand to other healthcare settings with the necessary adaptations or as new developments. Studies on patient safety issues in mental health and in primary care have been conducted in Switzerland already83-85 thus providing first empi rical insights into the most relevant areas for improve ment and necessary adaptations. In summary, we make the following recommendations: - Patient safety improvement efforts and the accompanying research need to be expanded to other healthcare settings beyond the hospital sector . This will require adaptations of existing strategies or new developments depending on the specific patient safety issues and the care context . - Patient safety improvement requires c omplex intervention s and accordingly sophisticated research designs for evaluation. - Given that even promising interventions often are abandoned shortly after the end of the project phase point at a need for support in the transition between the study period and the routine practice. The involvement of front -line staff responsible for implementing improvements and longer project durations are critical to sustain the effects long- term. - A national monitoring system for patient safety improvement that is adaptive new developments in the patient safety literature and linked to strategic patient safety goals to drive national safety programmes should be implemented at the national level. 27 - To ensure these changes a stronger commitment at the policy level including appropriate funding for large- scale projects is required. Limitations First, although we employed a very broad search strategy, relevant studies may have been missed. This can partly be attributed to a lack of consensus concerning the definition of patient safety interventions but may also be due to characteristics of our search strategy such as the exclusion of sources other than scientific journals or the limitation to articles published in English, French or German and the use of English search terms. How ever, we compensated for this limitation by thoroughly screening references instead of using restrictive search terms for the initial database- search. Second, the reporting quality of the included articles naturally influenced the quality of data extraction. We account for this limitation by conducting a structured assessment of quality. This also helped in exploring the strengths and weaknesses of the intervention studies included in this review and informed the recommendations for future research. Third, qualitative studies might have provided additional insights, especially concerning barriers and facilitators. Nevertheless, we excluded purely qualitative studies because they did not allow for assessing either the level of implementation or the effects of patient safety interventions which were the focus of this review. Finally, because the selected studies were conducted almost exclusively in the hospital setting the implications of this review for patient safety interventions in other healthcare settings , such as primary care, may be limited. Conclusions Despite being limited to Switzerland, this review identified considerable research evidence for a number of patient safety improvements. Nevertheless, publishi ng more actively on the improvement efforts occurring in Swiss healthcare such as for example the National Patient Safety week is one area for improvement. The challenges for the next years will be to expand patient safety research and improvement beyond the hospital sector, to design and evaluate complex intervention approaches and to use sophisticated research designs for their evaluation. Switzerland is well positioned to tackle these challenges given the research capacity of patient safety experts. However, to sustainably implement such a research- based improvement programme at a national level a stronger commitment including appropriate funding for large- scale projects is required. 28 References 1.

From the sQmh 's point of view, the discussion and work with quality issues in the healthcare system has seen an extreme increase over the last fifteen t o twenty years , and has been intensified. This diversity of activities is gratifying, and some of the objectives and improvements have been achieved. From the user 's point of view, however, the results are viewed critically , and the lack of an overall conc ept is criticised. Using a few examples, the report shows that requirements that require organisations to put in a lot of effort that makes little sense, as well as a lack of quality in measurements and key figures, call into question the legitimate effort s to achieve transparency. This triggers a critical to negative attitude on the part of those affected. Experts at grass roots level ( quality manager s) and user s/service provider s should be increasingly involved to avoid the development of further meaningl ess measurements of \"non -quality\" and the creation of further false incentives. The inclusion of users should be assured by giving the sQmh a seat on federal government's quality commission. Zusammenfassung Die sQmh ist das Vernetzung zur Basis sicherstellen. 2 Background In its capacity as an influential and broadly recognised expert body in matters related to healthcare quality management, since its establishment in 2003 the sQmh has guided, observed and supported activi ties and developments in quality and risk management. The sQmh' s members include the majority of hospitals in German- speaking Switzerland and organisations in the spitex (home nursing), old people' s and nursing home sectors. Together with its counterparts in Germany and Austria (the Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Qualit\u00e4tsmanagement in (ASQS)), the sQmh forms a trinational community that aims t o discuss and develop quality matters and stage joint events. On a national level the sQmh sees itself as a connecting element in healthcare, endeavouring to involve the wide range of parties concerned (acute care, rehabilitation, psychiatric and long -term care, as well as insurance companies, pharma and policymakers) and build constructive dialogue, within the framework of symposia, working groups devoted to specific issues, or bilateral projects. Building on the conviction that quality is a fundamental at titude that adds business value, the sQmh 's endeavours are geared to sustainable quality -related work. This means that quality is more than a mere glossy brochure or marketing instrument, and always involves leadership and aspects of ethics and morality as well. From the outset, the sQmh has also advocated the role of quality managers and their status within healthcare as a whole and within individual organisations. One of the keys to assuring quality is for quality professionals to perform, co- create and develop their role in line with the requirem ents. The Swiss Report is also to be seen in this light. Snapshot of current situation In the last 15 to 20 years there has been growing and increasingly in- depth engagement with and work on issues of quality management in healthcare. This is reflected bot h in the number of organisations and research projects explicitly devoted to quality, and in the way existing bodies, professional associations and care providers have engaged and intensified their efforts. In addition to this, there has been massively greater emphasis on quality metrics, key performance indicators, internal and external audits , and patient satisfaction surveys, which in turn has triggered a process of professionalization, particularly on the inpatient side. In this context, clinical risk m anagement has also become much more important as a component of quality management. These days practically all hospitals in Switzerland use a clinical incident reporting system (CIRS) and employ qualified specialists, sometimes in their own specialist departments and/or teams, often reporting direct to management, as part of their quality and risk management efforts. The focus on quality has been further intensified by the new hospital funding arrangements and the introduction of diagnosis related grouping (DRG) in acute care. This variety of activities and endeavours is gratifying, and in some cases the desired and targeted improvements and targets have been met. Examples include the way error reports, audits and certifications are handled. 3 Unresolved is sues The successes achieved so far have been reported frequently and with gusto, both when it comes to documenting the quality of the Swiss healthcare system and averting more stringent measures planned by the regulators. Users, by contrast - the professionals involved and affected at the grass roots level - view the results more critically and question the alleged successes. Seen from this point of view, until now there has been a lack of an authoritative, generally accepted overall concept (where and what is the whole picture). There are justified doubts as to the efficacy of current efforts to assure and improve quality, and as to whether the essential quality management issues are really being addressed in more depth. Particularly when it comes to obligatory measurement and the quality and impact of individual indicators, scepticism prevails as to whether the desired improvements in the quality of treatment and care can be achieved. An example of this is the ANQ 's decubitus ulcer measurements, which are conducted several times a year at great effort but which fail to bring organisat ions any new insight. Another example is the ongoing debate on rehospitalisation rates. Here there are justified doubts as to whether this metric really constitutes a quality indicator. The metric fails to capture deliberate and meaningful cooperation betw een hospitals, instead presenting it as rehospitalisation! These examples show that quality is still measured inadequately and on a fragmented basis. This is problematic, and possibly even counterproductive, from the perspective of increasing KPI transparency. It should also be pointed out that measurements of falls, decubitus ulcers, etc., are actually indicat ors of a lack of quality rather than of the presence of quality. Interfaces and points of cooperation are largely neglected, and as a result each ins titution assures and manages quality more or less for itself. To a large extent there is no cross -sectoral approach to quality management, and the requirements ignore the fact that in integrated care the majority of patients often go along the entire path from referrer to acute hospital and subsequent institution. To date the federal government has not managed to adopt and enforce a clear, all - encompassing stance and position on quality. In this connection, reference should also be made to the 2015 dispatch on the new quality act, which noted that the delegation of powers by the Federal Council to the tariff partners had had little effect, and that too few concepts and programmes for promoting quality had been implemented at a national level. Overarching fa ctors Requirements that often entail a lot of work for individual organisations but have little informative value or impact are leading to a growing collective aversion to the undisputedly important topic of quality. A lack of coordination between the federal government, the cantons and the insurers is resulting in a disproportionate amount of counterproductive administrative work, which additionally feeds dissatisfaction and reservations regarding quality. Internal resources primarily go to collecting and conducting measurements and meeting the requirements, meaning there is a lack of resources for developing and implementing actual quality -related activities. Competing requirements from the federal government, professional associations and insurers give those at grass roots level the impression of power struggles, creating annoying friction and a feeling of helplessness in the face of the struggle for the final say to which healthcare institutions are subject. An example is the constant stream of new requir ements, for example audits or the gathering of additional KPIs from individual health insurers without consultation and coordination with the FOPH. The 4 hospitals are required to provide similar but not identical information and verification. The sQmh is op en and neutral when it comes to the requirements and instruments for assuring and developing quality. However, it does have a vested interest in ensuring that quality -related work is always objective, transparent and coordinated , and done on the basis of s cientific insight, and that it represent s a reasonable balance between effort and benefit. The sQmh rejects requirements that because of conflicts of interest favour one side or are created for inexplicable reasons. The role of the federal authorities To date the federal government has not managed to adopt and enforce a clear, all - encompassing stance and position on quality. The FOPH, in its capacity as a pan- partisan, neutral agency, has not succeeded in coordinating its approach, demands and requireme nts with the rank and file and their capabilities and, as mentioned above, has failed to protect the institutions from abuse and take the necessary responsibility. There is still potential in terms of the way care providers are involved and in terms of coo peration with the rank and file. What from the grassroots point of view is seen as isolated engagement with only a small number of organisations - and always the same organisations - is not felt to be very constructive. The goal must be to put professional considerations above political considerations so that the measures taken have broad support in the rank and file. Greater weight should be given to technical and professional input and thus the incentive for those affected in practice to develop quality on a comprehensive basis. Failing this broader involvement it should come as no surprise if the implementation of requirements of this sort finds little support, and if basically highly motivated quality specialists at grassroots level experience requirements as a burden rather than as help or support. This adds up to a real deficit in terms of enforcement and implementation. Indicators and metrics This deficit , this defensive stance, becomes particularly noticeable when it comes to dealing with KPIs. In quality management, KPIs are important indicators of development and improvement. Valuable KPIs and insights from internal audits and error reports can be used to rapidly identify problems and initiate improvements. However, KPIs are only relevant and useful if they are adapted to the needs and the context of care providers, users and all their stakeholders. Preparing and interpreting KPIs requires a great amount of expertise and unders tanding of context. If KPIs gathered in- house are no longer understandable for those affected or seem flawed, they will be experienced as unjustified exposure rather than as a support. Without an interim step of interpretation, the complexity of metrics and KPIs is reduced to such an extent that misunderstandings easily arise, and all efforts to provide transparency are nullified. The result is media reports that do more harm than good because they propagate what is often false information as dangerous superficial knowledge on the basis of reduced and undifferentiated data. Last but not least, attention should be drawn to false and/or a lack of incentives. From the point of view of the sQmh and its members, the current incentives primarily put economic as pects and factors related to structural quality at the centre of quality management efforts. Actual quality -related work is rewarded too little or not at all. 5 Recommendations: Increased, more systematic involvement of organisations affected that are involved in the subsequent implementation and use of data and measures for improving quality. Collaboration between the FOPH and sQmh when it comes to selecting these organisations, to boost acceptance and practicability of decisions. Involvement of the sQmh i n the planned quality committee and/or in other bodies is therefore important and makes sense. This cooperation between the FOPH and sQmh is also important as a means of assuring overarching coordination and funding of metrics/measurements and avoiding the current overlaps between the activities of the different stakeholders involved. Specialists agree that isolated indicators never give the full picture. So the focus should be on meaningful metrics, and quality indicators should be chosen with an eye to integrated care/the entire patient path; looking at what's happening elsewhere, and abroad. More must be done to ensure that the focus is on both the effectiveness and efficiency of measures. There is a lack of resources everywhere at grassroots level, and c are providers must be able to use the available resources to meet the quality requirements and trigger the necessary improvements on the basis of the feedback. To assure that indicators are fair, useful and transparent and avoid false incentives, the quali ty and meaningfulness of indicators must be improved significantly. In cases of doubt external publication should be put back. Besides transparency, which goes without saying, the utility for care providers, and comprehensibility for patients, must also be borne in mind. To avoid situations in the future where individual care providers unjustifiably come under fire in the media, the FOPH needs to adopt a coordinated communications strategy and media relations, in consultation with the partners, when inform ation is published on quality -relevant topics and findings. Aarau, 07. M\u00e4rz 2019 1/10 The current status of quality and (patient) safety in the Swiss healthcare system from the perspective of the Swiss Academy for Quality in Medicine (SAQM/FMH) A paper produced by the authors in response to an invitation to contribute to the national report on quality and safety in the Swiss healthcare system Authors: - Dr Christoph Bosshard, Vice Chair of the FMH, director responsible for the data, demographics and quality department of the FMH - Lic. rer. oec. Esther Kraft, head of the data, demographics and quality (DDQ) department of the FMH - Roxane K\u00fcbler, MA, deputy head of the data, demographics and quality (DDQ) department of the FMH Bern, 8 January 2019 2/10 Abstract The Swiss Academy for Quality in Medicine SAQM is the physicians ' own quality organisation of the Swiss Medical Association FMH. It promotes medical quality work and ensures networking among medical organisations and with all important players in the healthcare system. Seventy -one medical organisations have signed the voluntary quality charter launched by the SAQM, thereby making a commitment to quality. The SAQM provides a comprehensive portfolio of services which ranges from networking in various committees, imparting knowledge in the form of online platforms for medical guidelines, registers and quality projects, a medical education course (CAS) to basic and position papers on fundamental issues and new developments. With it s quality projects, the SAQM has brought about numerous improvement measures, including an interprofessional peer review procedure in the field of acute care and a cross -sectoral treatment pathway for colorectal cancer. The pilot projects and the various quality initiatives of the medical profession have produced many positive results, which are the basis for further development and implementation. The central success factor of the SAQM 's quality efforts is comprehensive networking among all actors in the health care system. Another important factor is the pursuit of bottom -up processes in the implementation of quality aspects, which the SAQM ensures by involving the medical organisations. Akademie f\u00fcr Qualit\u00e4t in der Medizin (Swiss Academy for Quality in Medicine or SAQM) promotes quality -related work in medicine for the benefit of patients, their families and doctors, and takes a pioneering role in quality in medicine by coordinating quality - related issues on a national level in collaboration with the various disciplines, up - and downstream institutions, and the interfaces between the various specialisations. In demonstration of a strong commitment to an all -encompassing culture of quality, 72 physicians ' organisations have already signed the SAQM quality charter3, a document launched in 2016 on the pillars of transparency, commitment and sustainability. The goal of the quality charter is to maintain a self-motivated, structured examination of the aspects that make up quality , and to harness synergy within the framework of the networking enabled by the bodies of the SAQM. Convinced that quality starts with bottom -up processes at grass roots level, the SAQM deliberately does not lay down central guidelines for Swiss doctors or formulate a binding definition of quality 54. The SAQM does not have the authority to conduct quality controls, impose sanctions or issue certification. Quality control is a matter for the professional associations and the cantonal medical societies5. This report talks about quality issues from the perspective of the Swiss medical profession, which on the basis of its professional ethos and the legal framework has always concerned itself with optimum quality in the provision of its services. Responses to questions 1 What is known about the safety, quality and impact/effectiveness of Swiss healthcare? Quality and thus quality management have long been evaluated in Switzerland 7. According to international studies and surveys, the quality standards, safety and efficiency of Swiss healthcare have a leading position worldwide, a fact demonstrated by regular exchange and benchmarks with other countries6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. The SAQM 's quality -related services in Switzerland In its capacity as an independent quality association, the SAQM provides comprehensive services 3 https://saez.ch/de/article/doi/saez.2018.17275/ 4 https://www.fmh.ch/themen/qualitaet -saqm/saqm.cfm 5 https://www.fmh.ch/themen/qualitaet -saqm/saqm.cfm 6 European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies: Switzerland Health system review.

Besides the doctor 's profession, via its coordinating bodies the SAQM also covers the numerous interfaces to other actors in other areas of healthcare (hospitals, nursing, etc.). Examples of this include active exchange with partners in Swiss healthcare via the \"Dialog Qualit\u00e4t SAQM13\" quality dialogue committee, the involvement of quality managers from the medical organisations represented on the medical association via the \" Forum Qualit\u00e4t SAQM14\" quality forum, and the newly introduced interprofessional peer review procedure15 in cooperation with hospitals and nursing. The SAQM 's services are available to medical and partner associations as well as to individuals and third parties. The SAQM provides support with general technical quality -related questions, embarking on and submitting new topics, the networking and coordination of medical quality -related issues, and on a selective basis also with funding quality -related projects. FMH policy and position papers The policy papers16 and position papers17 based on them issued by the Swiss Medical Association (FMH) on current topics, which also cover all t he relevant quality -related issues, play a key role in ensuring standardised procedures in the Swiss medical profession. The documents published in September 2018 on PROMs18 were viewed several thousand times within a very short space of time. Since 2008 the SAQM has published 16 policy papers on various quality -related topics. Online platform for quality initiatives Since 2007 the FMH/SAQM have documented a range of quality -related activities19 on their website. The resulting platform for knowledge- sharing and connecting quality -related efforts reflects the breadth of medical quality assurance and development in Switzerland. Non- medical professional groups and organisations can also document and publish their quality -related ac tivities on this platform. Annual snapshot of activities The broad -based knowledge relating to the quality -related activities of medical organisations gathered by the SAQM through its networking and coordination enables the exploitation of synergies withi n the medical profession and the optimum exchange of available know -how. Since 2013 the SAQM has taken an annual snapshot of the quality -related activities developed, recommended and planned by the medical organisations by doing an online survey of their q uality officers. There are four blocks of questions covering activities related to their quality strategy, quality committee, standardised quality instruments (recommended and developed by the organisations themselves) and other work related to quality20. SAQM \"Innovation Qualit\u00e9\" quality award A current example of the FMH 's ongoing efforts to give even greater emphasis to issues of quality in the medical and healthcare professions is the SAQM 's newly -created Innovation Qualit\u00e921 quality prize, awarded for the first time in 2018 to tried -and-tested quality projects in Swiss healthcare. The prize, awarded every two years, covers three categories. The focus in 2018 was on \" rethinking patient care \". Of the 37 submissions, a number of projects related to patient s afety and from the medical organisations received an award. To network those doing pioneering thinking on medical quality in a wide range of disciplines and professions and the quality projects that received an award, the award- winning projects were announced in the Schweizerische \u00c4rztezeitung22 journal and in the broad media. 13 22 https://saez.ch/de/article/doi/bms.2018.06646/ 5/10 Training and continuing education In 2019, for the first time applications will be invited for a newly developed interprofessional and cross- sectoral CAS, sponsored by the SAQM, on quality in medicine for patient -centred working practice (Qualit\u00e4t in der Medizin f\u00fcr die patientennahe Arbeitspraxis). This certificate of advanced study in healthcare quality and safety covers the relevant aspects of day -to-day clinical practice and is geared to health professionals who work close to or directly with patients (doctors, medical practice assistants, nurses, health professionals, physiotherapists and occupational therapists). The goal of the course is to give health professionals confidence and mastery in relation to quality -related work in medicine. Candidates learn the theoretical principles and how to apply the necessary tools to deliver quality management projects (q- development, q- assurance and q- improvement). The CAS is designed to cover the entire range of patient care, emphasising the importance of involving all the relevant partners (including co- workers, patients, families and other people bearing responsibility) in quality development. Quality circle in basic medical care Quality circles have a long tradition in Switzerland23, supporting the continuing education that is key to quality development. Currently more than 80% of physicians in basic medical care are involved in quality cir cles, and a large number are organised in networks. Quality circles are a key instrument for quality development among peers. Quality circles are facilitated by trained moderators, and the doctors participating are able to apply their newly -acquired knowledge in practice. 2 What key improvements have been undertaken in terms of quality and safety within Swiss healthcare? The quality and thus the safety of treatment depend on whether validated procedures are used and treatments are conducted in line with the latest knowledge. The SAQM supports the Swiss medical professional with diverse measures designed to assure these standards and propagate the necessary know -how. Medical guidelines Medical guidelines play a major role in this, and demonstrably result in better -quality outcomes. They help when it comes to making evidence- based decisions in the interests of providing the best possible treatment to patients. To allow a better overview of the countless guidelines and make the latest versions available in each case, the SAQM has created an online platform called Guidelines Schweiz24 (Guidelines in Switzerland). Since 2017 professional associations, hospitals, clinics and other healthcare organisations have been able to document guidelines recognised by them on this online platform. Interprofessional peer review procedure The FMH/SAQM, H+ and Swiss Nurse Leaders have joined forces to create the Allianz Peer Review CH alliance and launch a single national interprofessional peer review procedure25 in acute care, based on the IQM Standards26. The procedure can be applied in the event of statistical abnormalities. Together with external (professional) peers, hospitals analyse patient dossiers to identify potential for improving treatment workflows. At the same time the procedure can also be used to validate or relativize the statistical abnormalities. For the purposes of the detailed concept the IQM approach was adapted to the linguistic and cultural peculiarities of Switzerland, and unlike Germany the principle of interprofessionalism was incorporated for the first time to allow for 23 http://www.hausaerzteschweiz.ch/fileadmin/user_upload/hausaerzteschweiz/Kommissionen/Qualitaet/7c_2005-12 - 28_Empf_med_QZ_V41.pdf 24 https://www.guidelines.fmh.ch/index.cfm?l=1 25 https://www.fmh.ch/files/pdf18/Peer_Review_Factsheet_Pilotprojekt_Allianz_V1.1_160606_D.pdf 26 https://www.initiative -qualitaetsmedizin.de/ 6/10 interprofessional improvements in addition to those on a cross -hospital or cross -disciplinary level. The insights and experience gained in the course of the pilot project show close practical relevance, and the procedure has now been adopted for the long term27. Given the success of the procedure in acute care, a single national peer review procedure is now also being set up for psychiatric care. Medical registers High-quality medical registers are key to the evaluation of treatment quality and t he assessment of care delivery structures. They also provide important data for health policy and planning. The SAQM 's online platform Forum medizinische Register Schweiz28 (Swiss medical register forum) represents an important quality improvement project, structuring information via registers and making them transparently accessible, facilitating networking among those operating registers, and serving as a point of orientation when setting up new registers. Recommendations on setting up and operating healt h-related registers Together with the ANQ, H+, SAMW and unimedsuisse, the SAQM is drawing up recommendations for setting up and operating health- related registers. These recommendations contribute to quality assurance and contain minimum standards for the set-up and operation of registers, including requirements regarding data protection and data quality29. As part of a pilot project , ten registers already in operation have now been reviewed in light of the recommendations. As a result, among other things the recommendations for a minimum data protection and data quality standard are being reviewed, which in turn will create a basis for optimising the quality of future registers and those already in operation. ReMed: support network for doctors in crisis sit uations ReMed30 is a support network for doctors. It propagates knowledge and experience related to health promotion and prevention for doctors, raising their awareness of their own health. ReMed offers a broad range of suppor t for doctors in crisis situations, designed to maintain their health and ability to function as physicians, and assure patient safety and a high quality of medical care. In such critical moments ReMed offers timely support to doctors and guides them on their way out of the crisis. For every contact , an experienced physician from the advisory team gets in touch within 72 hours and discusses the doctor 's personal situation. In 2017, 141 doctors made use of ReMed' s services. ReMed is an independent programme funded by the FMH. Healthcare research dialogue group Since 2009, the healthcare research dialogue group (Dialoggruppe Versorgungsforschung) 27 , under the leadership of the SAQM, has served as an information and dialogue platform where representatives of the FMH, NewIndex and the ISPM Bern research group regularly discuss current and planned work in the field of healthcare research. The dialogue group also organises events. In 2018 it staged an event on Switzerland 's status in terms of registers in medicine (Register in der Medizin - Wo steht die Schweiz?), which was attended by experts in science, policy and care provision from Switzerland and abroad. Interprofessional, cross- sectoral treatment path Progress in the treatment of disease and specialisation require the involvement of more and more specialists in the treatment chain. This means that patients are treated by different medical specialists, either in sequence or in parallel. This has significantly increased the importance of treatment paths . Together with around 20 professional medical associations and non -medical professional groups, in a pilot project the SAQM has developed and approved an interprofessional, cross- sectoral treatment for s/pdf17/Faktenblatt_Behandlungspfad_CRC_Juni_2016.pdf 7/10 Alongside guidelines and recommendations describing the treatment standard for care providers, the idea is to augment key interventions and the treatment path with high- quality patient information material that can help those affected when making decisions . Together with the Dialog Ethik ethics institute, the FMH/SAQM has drawn up overarching and specific criteria for evaluating patient information material. These quality criteria are designed to support patients in their own deliberations and decisions and help them prepare for consultations with each specialist. The total costs (including the hours worked by the SAQM and the organisations involved and the unpaid hours put in by members of the project team) of developing and approving this treatment path c ome to around CHF 700,000. This expense was borne entirely by the care provider organisations involved. PROMs Patient -reported outcome measures32 (PROMs) provide information from the patient 's point of view on their state of health and the effects of a treatment. PROMs facilitate patient -oriented treatment, communication between patients and doctors, and patient management (monitoring and adapting the course of treatment, recognising unidentified conditions, etc.). They allow conclusions to be drawn about the medical utility and indication. Building PROMs into the daily treatment routine fosters quality assurance and patient -oriented treatment. At the healthcare system level, PROMs can facilitate the evaluation of treatment opt ions, for example via a medical register, and augment medical guidelines in the context of examples of best practice. Last but not least, PROMs are ideal for use with digital tools. Ideally their use should lead to better self -efficacy, fewer visits to eme rgency wards, improved quality of life and better chances of survival for cancer patients. The integration of PROMs in daily treatment routine and the utility of doing so have to be evaluated. To this end the SAQM has conducted a pilot project called Patient Centered Outcome Registry (PCOR)33 with the aim of capturing information from patients on their diagnosis, therapy, suffering and complaints, quality of life, indirect costs and achievement of the treatment goal. This enables evaluation of the patient - centred indication and the outcome, facilitates needs -appropriate treatment, and optimises decisions on therapy. The SAQM does not currently have any results regarding our \"Patient centered outcome registry (PCOR)\" project, which would fall into the PROMS c ategory. In the \"Patient -reported outcome measures: die Patientensicht z\u00e4hlt (the patient view counts)\" the benefits, limits and challenges of implementing PROMs, and the necessary measures, are discussed on the basis of the scientific literature. In the \"PROMs f\u00f6rdern die patientenorientierte Behandlung\" (PROMs promote patient -oriented treatment) position paper, the SAQM/FMH describe the goals pursued by the SAQM/FMH in terms of PROMS to give a recommendation to the professional associations and other healthcare organisations regarding PROMs. 3 What are the results of this, and what is known about their sustainability? Via the SAQM the medical profession signals to the outside world that it takes quality assurance and development very seriously; the SAQM therefore constitutes an important strategic step for the medical profession. The findings of an external evaluation of the SAQM show that it is perceived by its target audiences and meets with acceptance and interest across the ci rcle of different people involved in its various bodies. The SAQM has been able to initiate and implement many activities and developments that can be deemed to be positive, for example input for projects that have emerged from improved knowledge transfer between the interested actors, or the pilot project to create a cross -sectoral treatment path for colorectal cancer. The repositories of medical guidelines and those of the Swiss medical register forum both constitute a major contribution to transparency and easier access to medical knowledge. They are being 32 https://saez.ch/de/article/doi/saez.2018.17188/ 33 https ://www.fmh.ch/files/pdf20/2018 -04-03_PCOR_Faktenblatt_D.pdf 8/10 constantly expanded to ensure the work done has a sustained impact. Results of annual snapshot Regular surveys of the FMH members involved in the SAQM, for example the annual snapshot, show that continuous quality -related work embedded in daily routine has an impact and is sustainable. The last annual snapshot in 2017 saw the participation of 51 medical organisations, an outstanding response rate of 74 per cent34. Medical organisations have been getting actively involved, and the number of organisations with quality recommendations has increased steadily since 2013. Further results The results of innovative projects such as the CRC treatment path, the introduction of PROMs, the introduction of interprofessional peer review procedures, and the creation of a new CAS programme on quality in medicine for patient -centred working practice are further evidence of how the work of the SAQM is adding comprehensive value for doctors, patients, their famili es and society as a whole. 4 What are the keys to success? The main key to the success of the SAQM 's projects and activities is the coordination role the SAQM plays within the medical profession as well as for the numerous other actors in the Swiss healthcare system as a whole. The SAQM 's Quality Forum and Quality Dialogue platforms are good examples of this. The Quality Forum assures the involvement of all physicians ' organisations, while Quality Dialogue assures the involvement of the most important heal thcare partners. Close, transparent involvement of physicians ' and partner organisations enables the SAQM to launch activities and projects with the support and backing of these organisations and thus get the necessary commitment (e.g. the SAQM quality charter, the cross -sectoral treatment path, the CAS in quality in medicine, the Peer Review CH alliance, and recommendations for setting up and operating health- related registers). Another key success factor is the SAQM 's grass roots orientation and systemat ic adherence to bottom -up processes35 in the development and optimisation of quality -related aspects. This is the only way of making sure that the consolidated knowledge of the various organisations can feed into the work and be actively used by all the actors involved. The policy and position papers also fall into this category: they do not constitute central FMH requirements, but are designed to create the basis for a scientifically -based discussion of professional policy. The SAQM works in accordance with the latest standards, placing great emphasis on interprofessionalism, a systematic and transparent approach concomitant with the digital age, introducing and evaluating new approaches such as cross -sectoral treatment paths , and the latest trends such as the implementation of PROM (patient -recorded outcome monitoring) and PCOR (patient -centred outcomes research). The SAQM fosters close cooperation with the Foundation for Patient Safety (Stiftung Patientensicherheit). For ex ample, in its capacity as a founder member of the foundation the FMH is co-funding the new structural aids to be created for future interprofessional morbidity and mortality conferences36 (MoMo). The aim of the project is to r einforce MoMo as a central vehicle for organisational and individual learning in Switzerland and as an important tool for promoting patient safety. 34 https://www.fmh.ch/files/pdf20/SAQM_Qualitatsbericht_2017_D.pdf 35 https://saez.ch/de/article/doi/bms.2017.05675/ 36 https://www.patientensicherheit.ch/forschung -und-entwicklung/morbiditaets -und-mortalitaetskonferenzen/ 9/10 5 What obstacles and challenges have the measures encountered? The most significant inhibiting factor has been a lack of human and financial resources. The scheduled tariff -based compensation of medical and administrative services is posing challenges for doctors. Ensuring optimum care for patients and doing the quali ty-related work this entails is part and parcel of the daily work of any physician. The growing administrative burden on doctors, which according to various studies has increased in recent years, constitutes a major challenge37. The SAQM advocates transpar ency in medical quality. This transparency can only be achieved if a fair, fact -based discussion takes place. The SAQM works for a high level of quality in our healthcare system and genuine competition on quality. However, this is only possible if quality data are gathered and evaluated correctly. The needs of patients must always be at the centre of these endeavours, which is why the SAQM supports target -group -specific transparency. Not all quality data are equally useful or able to be interpreted for the different stakeholder groups, which means that not all quality data are suitable for broad publication. Incomplete, incorrect or incorrectly analysed or published medical quality data distort reality and prevent the medical profession from demonstrating the good quality of its work. Last but not least, this can also result in the public being misled, undermining its trust in the healthcare system unjustifiably. A positive impact through the right incentives can only be achieved by publishing complete and co rrect quality data that recipients can understand. 6 What peculiarities of the Swiss environment facilitate or hinder interventions? The high level of quality -consciousness among the Swiss medical profession and the wide range of different quality -related work it does are supporting factors that have an influence on the entire healthcare system. The SAQM quality charter is a typically S wiss example where federalist structures are constructively deployed on a self -motivated basis, rather than with coercion, to the substantial benefit of society as a whole. Inhibiting factors are the amount of time and coordination necessitated by consult ation procedures within the association. The reward, however, is broadly -based consolidated positions. Account also has to be taken of the multilingualism and regional cultures peculiar to Switzerland, although this should be seen as an asset. A major com plicating factor is that resource- intensive quality development and assurance work is still not recognised as additional service provision and therefore does not receive firm funding38. This can inhibit doctors ' motivation to take on the additional administ rative burden necessary for quality assurance. Recommended improvements 1) The SAQM and the entire FMH intend to build on the existing organisations to continue the coordinated quality efforts already undertaken. The approach adopted within the SAQM and i ts affiliated bodies, firmly established as a bottom -up process in the associations, creates commitment, uses synergy, and involves the consolidated knowledge of the organisations concerned, systematically and efficiently. Quality is delivered on a routine, self -motivated basis by those at grass roots level. 2) The SAQM and FMH are actively working for the creation of legislation on the basis of draft 37 https://www.fmh.ch/files/pdf21/Revision_TARMED_final.pdf 38 https://saez.ch/de/article/doi/bms.2018.06622/ 10/10 amendments (15.083) to the Federal Health Insurance Act. Among other things, there have to be binding arrangements for the funding of quality -related work. Care providers have made considerable preliminary investments in terms of content and funds in the form of projects already delivered by the individual associations and the SAQM. The legislator must also recognise the medical quality development and assurance work done by doctors and provide firm funding for it, either within the tariff framework or as separate compensation.

The accreditation focuses on the cycle of continuous quality improvement and the evaluation is carried out by peers, acting as an interprofessional audit-team. SanaCERT Suisse also assists other bodies in the healthcare sector to apply th is method for accreditation in different specialties . Three main factors promote sustainability of the accreditation SanaCERT Suisse . Collaboration in interprofessional and interdisciplinary core group s enhance shared value among professi onals . The quality standards form a dynamic system that is revised regularly. The method helps commitment towards quality development, being flexible to meet the needs of the institution . Institutions accredited by SanaCERT Suisse appreciate the following key factors of the method . The standards are close to core business and readily applicable. There is a wide range of standards and a free choice of approach for implementation . The majority of the standards require c ross-departmental and interprofessional collaboration which has a positive impact on treatment safety and promotes networking in the institution. Evaluation is carried out by peers in a mutual appreciative manner. A drawback of the method SanaCERT Suisse is the lack of any benchmark across institutions . The financial challenge is perceived in a good balance between expenditure and benefits of the quality accreditation process. For the development of quality and safety, the authors recommend to ask for evidence on contin uous improvements of processes and structure but to allow a choice of method. SanaCERT Suisse -Swiss National Report on Safety and Healthcare - 3 of 9 SanaCERT Suisse is a Non -Profit Foundation for accreditation of quality management and improvements in health care accredit ing management systems of hospitals and long-term care facilities according to standards in order to improve basic health care services across Switzerland. Since 2006 SanaCERT Suisse has been accredited by the S wiss authorities for accreditation of management systems based on ISO/IEC 17021 -1. The SanaCERT Suisse Foundation was founded in 2001 by experts in this field and Swiss healthcare institutions. At that time, the Swiss Association for Quality in Health Care (VQG) was dissolved and transferred to the SanaCERT Suisse Foundation. The VQG, founded in 199 4, can be described as the real pioneer in the Swiss healthcare system, initiating early quality development in hospitals based on continuous improvement of patient- centred care . Inspired by the system of the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations5 the founders were guided by the principle that quality development should be based on accreditation with quality standards and an interprofessional peer review method . In 2013 the initial model was adapted to enable accreditation first of long-term care facilities and then of institutions with vertical or horizontal integrat ed health care service. The website of SanaCERT Suisse provides an overview of accredited institutions . SanaCERT Suisse has acquired a considerable expertise in developing standards for structural, process and outcome quality. Currently there are 25 quality standards for acute somatic and 16 for long -term care6. The standards serve the institutions as guidelines for their process modelling, especially with new iss ues. The patient -oriented and practical approach in the standards facilitates the understanding by the professionals and helps create a common language. A periodic revision of the standards as well as the development of new standards guaranties to keep up with overall changes in health care. Institutions that aim for accreditation have to adhere to some mandatory standards and choose a given number of quality standards out of the available standards . All quality standards have been developed by experts base d on scientific evidence and in interdisciplinary and interprofessional exchange. The standards focus on the quality (structur e, process and outcome) of interprofessional and interdisciplinary care ad dressing all health care workers in an institution with a particular focus on patient centred care. Audits include an evaluation of accomplished Plan-Do-Check -Act cycle s of every standard. SanaCERT Suisse pioneered a systematically applied peer review method with interprofessional teams for auditing . Cons equently , the evaluation is carried out exclusively by p eers. For auditing hospitals e ach audit -team consists of a leading auditor, a health care manager, a physician and a nurse in a leading position . The leading auditor is a qualified auditor with a health professional background . His function is to ensure the adherence with the norms of ISO 17021- 1. For long -term care facilities the audit -team is constituted by a leading auditor, a nursing home manag er and a nursing manager or clinical nurse specialist . Once a year SanaCERT Suisse offers training courses for all peers . In accordance with the philosophy of continuous quality improvement and of shared acceptance and esteem, SanaCERT Suisse systematically ask s accredited institutions to evaluate the audit- process and audit team . This has enabled SanaCERT Suisse to continuously develop the process of auditing. 5 www.jointcommission.org 6 The current set of standards, along with the criteria of evaluation are available on www.sanacert.ch . SanaCERT Suisse -Swiss National Report on Safety and Healthcare - 4 of 9 Conformity with standards is examined every three years by on site audits. During these audits two main elements are assessed and rated: compliance with the standard elements and application of the Plan-Do-Check -Act cycle as well as the degree of institution wide implement ation and adherence to the standards . Audits include evalu ation of documents, interviews with collaborators and a site visit . In the case of nonconformity, the audit team defines conditions or recommendations that need to be appropriately addressed within a given period to maintain the accreditation . SanaCERT Suisse also attributes a great importance to qual ity management improvement . During the audits a conscious discussion is sought on quality development strategies focusing on further standard implementation but also on a larger vision of quality improvement . Between accreditation audits , sustainability of adherence to quality standards is confirmed based on yearly self -report s and visit s on site by a leading auditor. During on -site visits, the leading auditor assesses whether the requirements from the previo us accreditation s have been satisfied and whether the institution is involved in the further work and development of its quality management. This enables a constant evaluation and support towards quality improvement . The foundation also acts as an independent audit body for quality management on behalf of professional's associations and the authority in the healthcare sector7. SanaCERT Suisse assists its partners by developing and operationalizing discipline -specific quality indicators, training peers as auditors, and conducting audits in accordance with the ISO Norm 17021- 1. Thus, the auditing of the following labels or confirmation of quality assurance and improvements is modelled according to the core elements of San aCERT Suisse method: Q - Label for breast care centres, Label for Baby friendly hospitals, accreditation for stroke centres and units, confirmation of adherence to cantonal quality requirements in Aargau , Accreditation of Curaviva Zurich, Label of swiss cancer network and q -label for palliative care. The method seems particularly popular with professional associations because of their own professional criteria being applied as standards and reviewed by the ir own experts. What is known about t he sustainability of the SanaCERT Suisse method ? Currently 20 institutions are accredited , with some of them over a period of 16 years . 3 new institutions are in the accreditation process. In our experience the accreditation SanaCERT Suisse shows three main assets. Accre dited hospitals and long -term care facilities form interprofessional and interdisciplinary core groups to implement the standards. Moreover, t hey provide initial training for all newcomers as well as continuous training on quality standards for all staff . Both aspects enhance the development of shared values among the professionals and the embedding of the standards into daily work. Besides feed - back on further potentials r egular audits serve as acknowledgement of good performance and as such maintain moti vation to engage into quality improvement processes . 7 The Swiss Cancer Foundation, UNICEF Switzerland, the Swiss Federation of Clinical Neuro -Societies, the authorities of Canton Aargau, Curaviva Canton Zurich, the Association of Swiss Hospitals H+, the Swiss Medical Association FMH, the Swiss Society of Med ical Oncology SGMO . SanaCERT Suisse -Swiss National Report on Safety and Healthcare - 5 of 9 The existing quality standard sets have undergone numerous evaluations and revisions proving the dynamic s of the system . The accredited institutions are actively involved in standard adaptation and creation to ensure their feasibility . Since the same standards are applied in different institutions and are peer reviewed , we observe an increasing exchange of good practice models among institutions. During audits we observe a high level of motivation and commitment towards quality development among collaborators. Our method is based on an active involvement of collaborators and flexible in the priorities the individual institution needs to define, both elements might facilitate the motivation. Many institu tions replace standards after two periods of accreditation s, i.e. six years in order to focus on new, emerging topics. Furthermore, the quality management based on the Plan- Do-Check -Act Cycle allows the institutions to detect a ny deterioration of quality performance in a replaced standard in time and to respond appropriately at early stages of deterioration . SanaC ERT Suisse also conducted a survey in 2017 among accredited institutions that allowed identifying the following success factors: practical relevance of the standards, focus on clinical issues, peer review method, interprofessional and interdisciplinary approach. These factors will be discussed in greater detail below. Which key factors characterize the San aCERT Suisse method? One main feature lies in the fact that the quality standards are close to the core business of medicine and care. The standards are developed and reviewed by experts who are familiar with the subject ; experts who are able to identify t he keys to high quality treatment and patient care. The standard \" Pain Management \", to name one example, requires guidelines , proof of regular training of staff and evaluation of treatment. The standard s' language and the quality criteria can be easily underst ood by physicians and nurses. In a survey with health care professionals, the standards were described as readily applicable in every day work (2017). The institutions themselves define the action they undertake to meet the requirements of the standards . This is another outstanding feature. The standards do not prescribe the content s of guidelines, the structure of training or the process of the evaluation of quality measures . Each accredited institution is free to choose its own preferred appr oaches or can even adapt proven practices from other institutions. This makes the standards suitable for a wide range of institutions, varying in size and the care provided . Most standards require c ross-departmental and interprofessional collaboration . In the 2018 version, this applie s to 22 out of 25 quality standards for acute care and to all 16 standards for long-term care . A good example for this requirement is again the quality standard \" Pain Management\" . Historically in-house hospital guidelines have often been defined at the level of clinics or departments. Consequently , pain management might differ between the surgical and the medical department of the same hospital. The anaesthetist specialized in pain management, working in both departments , must then be familiar with different guidelines . The SanaCERT Suisse standard calls on the health professionals of all departments of a hospital to agree on one guideline for pain management, which enhances the safety of the treatment . The accreditation process of SanaCERT Suisse encourages interprofessiona l and inter - disciplinary teamwork, strengthening the horizontal network of an institution. The audit SanaCERT Suisse -Swiss National Report on Safety and Healthcare - 6 of 9 team itself , consisting of peers from different fields like hospital management, medicine and nursing, conveys a strong signal that the goals of quality management can only be achieved through close interprofessional and interdisciplinary collaboration The variety of standards enables an institution to set different priorities in quality improvement over time. SanaCERT Suisse demands for the accreditation of the quality management of a hospital the review of a set of eight standards, including the mandatory basic standard \"Quality Management\". This leaves the hospital to choose seven standards according t o its own preferences. For nursing care facilities seven standards are required with the following three mandatory ones addressing the topics: \"Quality Management\", \"Rights of the Residents \" and \"Nursing and Care\". This free dom of choice of standards is highly appreciated by the accredited institutions. It enables the institutions to choose the standards where quality improvement is most wanted and to set the pace for the choice of new standards according to the resources available. E xperience has shown that the institutions apply the lessons learnt from the audited standards to good measures in other areas as well. Another key feature lies in the way of working that values mutual esteem between the institution and the reviewers . This attitude leads to mutual trust and allows an open discussion of problems, of future quality improvements , and the best possible use of resources . The above mentioned 2017 survey showed a high appreciation for such contribution s by the reviewers and was regarded as a significant added value to the accreditation process. M utual respect allows peers to draw attention to issues that the institution is not fully aware of. Care is taken to ensure that the accredit ing body does not suggest any solutions, but only refers to the problems. What are the barriers and challenges encountered? An accreditation of SanaCERT Suisse requires the commitment of the management of various departments, which for some institutions presents a high barrier. On the other hand, although SanaCERT Suisse demands key figures as part of the Plan-Do-Check -Act cycle the system doesn't allow a benchmark across institutions. Hospitals, in particular, are increasingly under pressure to compete with other institutions and to provide compa rative figures with the focus having shifted towards statistic al analysis of outcome measure s in recent years. Quality management requires resources to maintain a system allowing quality assurance and improvement. Decreasing resources in quality management might not result in an immediate reduction of care quality but have serious consequences on the long term . Over the last years financial cuts in the Swiss health care system forced institutions to reconsider their allocation of resources . Some experts argue that quality management can be time -consuming and thus reduce time that health care providers could spend in direct patient care. Furthermore , evidence of a functioning quality management system is still not rewarded and varies widely between canton s. Nevertheless, recently we observe the development of quality labels leading to financial recognition or mandate for services. However, these labels or accreditation s cover exclusively a particular area of specialisation or address a particular aspect of care. Hospitals tend to prefer these isolated solutions to an overall quality management system , even more under economic pressure . In the era of increasing economic health care crises, one major challenge lies in the maintenance of a good balance between expenditure and benefits of the quality accreditation process. SanaCERT Suisse -Swiss National Report on Safety and Healthcare - 7 of 9 These issues have to be addressed within a policy framework that aims to optimise the quality of care in the Swiss health care syste m. In particular, incentives for quality management should be reconsidered with a perspective on the whole health care system. Testimonial of an accredited institution Joachim Koppenberg8 Since 1996, our hospital has pursued its quality management with the help of the peer review method and was audited for the first time in 1998 by VQG, the preceding organization of SanaCERT Suisse. Since 2001 our institution has been regularly and consistently audited and successfully (re -)accredited several times by the subsequent SanaCERT Suisse foundation. Under the umbrella of the Health Centre \"Unterengadin\", since 2007 the following institutions have been working closely together within the framework of integrated regional health care in the spirit of \"everyt hing from a single source\": a public hospital, accident and emergency services, home care service, an advice centre for nursing and care, a rehabilitation clinic, a nursing home, three residential care groups and a wellness bath. The Health Centre \"Unteren gadin\" operates a joint quality management system and was accredited as the first health care network in Switzerland in 2014, following a successful re -accreditation in 2018. The reasons for committing to the peer review method in general and for collabora ting with the SanaCERT Suisse Foundation in particular for almost 20 years in the field of quality assurance are manifold. The principle of peer review is ideal for organisations with a high degree of expertise and diversity with usually no trivial and st raightforward solutions. Hence, we appreciate the conversation from expert to expert for the real understanding of the sections to be audited, leading to a much higher acceptance for the audit among our experts than verification by non -specialists, a circu mstance that is especially in medicine of great importance. In medicine, still tending to be dominated by hierarchies, it is seldom only a question of the right profession, but also of the auditor's position (chief or leading physician, nursing service manager or nursing expert and CEO or hospital director) . Both aspects play a vital role to overcome the first important barrier of professional competence for an open, appreciative and ultimately target- oriented expert discussion at eye level among colleagues . While this procedure has often been perceived as too \"soft\" and facts and figures were preferred, in the German -speaking countries peer review as a dynamic procedure has fortunately experienced a renaissance in the health care system in recent years. Furthermore, the quality standards by SanaCERT Suisse are based on the clinically relevant core processes of care and require to demonstrate consistently improving steps in the Plan-Do-Check -Act cycle with verifiable key figures. Many patient's path- oriented standards imply cross- departmental solutions within an institution and in some cases even cross- company solutions. 8 Chairman of the Board of Management of the Health Centre \"Unterengadin\" and Chief Physician for Anaesthesiology, Pain Therapy and Rescue Medicine, Ospidal Scuol; peer for SanaCERT Suisse since 2005. SanaCERT Suisse -Swiss National Report on Safety and Healthcare - 8 of 9 Those solutions are developed in standard groups, which are preferably being composed inter-disciplinary and interprofessional , a fact which represents another major advantage. The collaborators concerned up front are directly involved in the process of development and implementation. During the most active periods, in addition to professional quality managers up to one third of all health prof essionals have been directly involved in quality assurance in our institution. This, in turn, leads to a high level of acceptance of the method and an understanding of quality assurance and thus to smooth integration in working life. Thanks to our close co llaboration with SanaCERT Suisse, our institution has been able to develop our quality of care noticeably and measurably over the past two decades. It can be stated that quality management has become an integral part of our organizational DNA thanks to San aCERT Suisse. But SanaCERT Suisse has also continued to evolve over the years, by regularly developing new standards and updating existing with our contribution as an accredited institution. This allows us to incorporate the practical point of view into the standards. And as already mentioned, SanaCERT Suisse proved to be open for providing a solution for accredit ing our whole network. SanaCERT Suisse is thus demonstrating impres sively that it is flexible, needs oriented, not only having the right feeling for the needs of the complex and changing health care market, but actively meets these needs. As I have the privilege of acting as peer for SanaCERT Suisse, auditing other health care facilities, I see even underlying effects. I am always fascinated and deeply impressed to see how other institutions solve similar problems in their own special manner. The consistent implementation of the peer review idea allows to unfold its full impact: While we receive valuable suggestions and hints for improvement by esteemed colleagues at the audits, I can also regularly share my professional competence and experience during my visits with peers - and learn from the best. This kind of 2nd order learning results in another Plan-Do-Check -Act cycle that might not be explicitly recognised at a first glance. Recommendations for the development of Quality and Safety in Swiss Healthcare Based on our experience we suggest four main aspects to be considered for the development of quality and safety in Swiss healthcare. Process modelling and optimized structures are important promoters for a continuous quality improvement. Therefore, health care facilities should be encouraged to provide evidence for the continuous development of the corresponding processes and structures in addition to measuring quality indicators. Health care facilities vary considerably in size, mandate for services, cantonal demands and other conditions. Hence there also is a difference in the appropriate method for quality improvement. It is therefore important, that the authorities define a range of suitable options on different accreditation or certification methods the health care facilities can choose from. Health care facilities providing evidence of a functioning quality management should get some kind of reward or recognition. To avoid misallocation of resources, e.g. by favouring island solutions, an overall quality management system cover ing all essential areas , focusing on patient- centred care and asking for cross - departmental and interprofessional collaboration should be preferred . SanaCERT Suisse -Swiss National Report on Safety and Healthcare - 9 of 9 On a national level the selection and method of collecting the quality indicators should be harmonised and coo rdinated with international guidelines. This makes a meaningful comparison (benchmark) possible and shows where quality improvement would have the greatest impact in the health care system . Development instead of a standstill: accreditation for medical practices This is a contribution to the Swiss National Report on Quality and Safety in Healthcare Martin Hoek , Ph.D. Deputy Managing Director, Head of Research and Development, EQUAM Foundation Paula Bezzola, MPH Managing Director, EQUAM Foundation . Date of Submission: 22nd January 2019 2 Abstract The accreditation of medical practices promotes the development dynamics of the businesses and contributes to an improvement in the work conditions of health professionals. Moreover, it also contributes to an increase in cost efficiency. In Switzerland, there are currently no regulatory requirements regarding accreditation. Accordingly, this has led to it having a niche status. Approximately 10 per cent of the primary care providers in Switzerland work in medical practices that have an EQUAM practice certif icate. Two longitudinal studies on the effectiveness of practice accreditation conducted by the European Praxis Assessment (EPA) have consistently found that practices that have EPA accreditation, which was also applied by the EQUAM Foundation between 2004- 2017, are better structured and push ahead with quality development in their businesses. They do so to a greater extent than non- accredited practices. Although accreditation alone is no guarantee of quality, it makes proper medical services considerably more likely through compliance with appropriate criteria. In addition, the practices promote a culture in which constant quality development and improvement is rooted. The aims and history of EQUAM The EQUAM Foundation has devoted itself since its founding in 1999 to the accreditation of outpatient healthcare facilities, and medical practices in particular. The Foundation has its roots in the environment of integrated care. Most accredited practices are members of doctor networks. But even independent practices choose to earn accreditation. In the early years of the Foundation, mainly the doctor networks became accredited. From 2004, the accreditation of primary care practices according to the standards of the European Practice Assessment (EPA) was added1. Since 2018, the EQUAM foundation has accredited primary care practices according to its own guidelines2. These guidelines were developed by the EQUAM Foundation together with Swiss experts from practice and research based on the EPA standards and other internationally recognised programmes. Thus, the EQUAM Foundation guidelines were always and still are specifically adapted to the everyday reality of medical practices. In addition to accreditation of primary care practices, the EQUAM Foundation also offers accreditation for specialist practices, radiology institutes and accreditation of integrated care for doctor networks. Physicians can also receive accreditation for treatment quality. The latter has an even greater focus than practice accreditation on the medical treatment itself. Based on certain patient groups, the implementation of evidence- based treatm ent guidelines is reviewed. Accreditation for treatment quality is currently implemented for the area \"medical safety\" and the diagnosis groups \"arterial hypertension\", \"diabetes mellitus\" and \"coronary heart disease\". A change in practice culture to turn a practice into a learning organisation is and remains the most important goal of EQUAM accreditation for medical practices. The offering of a framework of content and the possibility to compare one's achievement of standards through benchmarks with other practices are only partial steps on this path. Achieving good results naturally also requires structures and processes that correspond to the requirements of practices. 3 Preparing for the primary care accreditation audit requires on average 25 hours of w ork for a physician or a medical practice assistant. This is manageable even for a small practice, and even more so for larger group practices. T he precise effort required depends on how many criteria a practice already meets before the audit and how well organised it is. With the exception of minimum criteria, the EQUAM accreditation does not require all criteria to be met from the beginning. This means that the practice can set priorities aligned with its background situation and individual needs so that it can further develop step by step. As at the end of 2017, a total of 254 practices comprising 611 doctors were accredited by EQUAM. Most of these were primary care practices, with the exception of seven specialist doctors and two paediatrics practices. Excluding the latter, calculations indicate that as at the end of 2017, of the 5,918 physicians3 with a specialist certification in general and internal medicine who practice medicine in the outpatient care sector in Switzerland, approximately ten per cent work in an EQUAM accredited practice. Benefits of accreditation In an often quoted review ar ticle on the hurdles to implementation of integrated care in the US, Berwick et. a l. 2008 postulated that improvements in healthcare must pursue three aims: the improvement of patient satisfaction, better health amongst the population and a reduction in healthcare costs4. Bodenheimer and Sinsky (2014) supplemented these three aims with a fourth: the improvement of work conditions for healthcare professionals. In particular, the authors focus on a decrease both in dissatisfaction with the career and the likelihood of a burnout5. It is also known that a work environment adapted to task performance and the system, as well as processes aligned with the aims, increase patient safety6. The aims listed are identical with those of EQUAM Foundation's practice accreditation7. But to what extent are these aims being met? In Switzerland, there are no regulatory requirements that prescribe accreditation. As a result , there is a lack of incentives to see added value in it. The decision in favour of accreditation th us lies with the service providers, their networks and the corresponding business organisations. The cantonal health authorities only mandate or recommend accreditation as part of their supervisory duty in exceptional cases. Thus, u nlike in other countries as, for instance, Denmark8, in Switzerland it is rare for the requirement of accreditation to be stipulated by a state authority. However, there is sufficient justification here for a practice to earn accreditation. The fulfilment of requirements for accreditation supports practice management and its staff in business operations and organisation. It initiates and promotes the development dynamics of the businesses and contributes to an improvement in the work conditions for health professionals. With the offer of a framework of content through the accreditation process and the fulfilment of requirements, including the definition of development goals, the practice sets itself on a path to becoming a dynamic, learning organisation. It can then better react to new challenges and is better able to deal with existing requirements. 4 By fulfilling certain criteria and achieving the associated increase in effectiveness, cost efficiency in the practice as well as the treatment processes overall also improve. This is achieved thanks to better coordination of treatment with other service providers and the avoidance of complications or unnecessary services. Some health insurers honour this with additional compensation if the practice in question belongs to a network. Critique s of accreditation Relatively high staff costs for the accreditation process with little added value is often criticised. It is argued that accreditation is useless because it is not directly geared toward an improvement in treatment results, but quality is rather defined solely based on fixed processes and structures instead of developing these further. Criticism of accreditation in the healthcare sector occasionally also arises from the fact that quality certificates at the beginning of the second half of the 20th century were originally developed for industrial production processes within the scope of quality management. This side argues that service companies, which incl udes medical practices, are structured differently and that in rendering interaction- based services, the individual components must take and maintain precedence over standardized processes. As much as this objection is to be taken into account in creating standards according to which medical facilities can be accredited, it cannot be denied that medical practices are organised business entities that , if better organised, are better able to complete their tasks. So, for example, rooms must be suited to their intended purpose, equipment and devices serviced, medicines stored professionally, patient safety ensured, hygiene guaranteed and operations and communications made suitable for staff and the performance of services. Accordingly, some principles of traditional quality management also apply to medical practices. The key difference between the manufacturing of industrial products and the rendering of services in the healthcare sector is that industrial processes must be completely identical. In healthcar e however, a great variance in basic conditions and individual needs and wishes of the patients necessitates a large degree of flexibility in the processes. Modern practice accreditation - such as that of the EQUAM Foundation - takes full account of this f act. A further point of contention regards the selection and assessment of criteria and the issue of what is actually relevant to the definition of quality. There is inevitably the need to limit the number of criteria to be used when developing accredita tion programmes. Based on what is known, these criteria should be fundamental and it should be possible to assess the criteria with a reasonable effort. For the efficiency of accreditation programmes, it is crucial that insights from research and practice are applied in the selection of criteria and variables. Moreover, the criteria must be formulated in such a way that various organisational structures and possible methods can be taken into account to address the culture and situation of the practice. The recommendations for accreditation of the Swiss Academy for Medical Sciences (SAMW)9 and the requirements of the Swiss Accreditation Office (SAS) are also taken into account in the development of the EQUAM programmes . These guidelines include, for example, training and education of the auditors and independence of the accrediting body. 5 Sometimes however, despite criteria that have been selected with the utmost diligence, the review of these criteria by an external body is perceived by physicians as an unreasonable demand or even as an insult. In these cases, the additional knowledge from quality management and regarding patient safety is not deemed by physicians to be beneficial for medical work or quality, which in turn highlights the importance of the affected managers' view of quality management and the importance of leadership10. This applies to the management of medical practices and doctor networks alike. Practices where the implementation of quality criteria in day -to-day work is supported and modelled by management, see a further professionalization and increase in quality as well as greater satisfaction amongst staff and patients. How this is dealt with is of vital importance to the result of the business acti vities of medical practices. A well organised company renders better services. This is also confirmed by effectiveness studies on accreditation in medical practices as is shown in the section below. Evidence and effect While objections were raised in a British publication in 2012 that the evidence basis on effectiveness, cost efficiency and suitability of the accreditation of practices is considered to be relatively limited11, it was also pointed out that the information regarding the effectiveness of EPA accreditation used by the EQUAM Foundation between 2004- 2017, represents a notable exception. A longitudinal study from 2011 with a comparison group of 102 practices each makes clear that the performance of accredited medical practices has significantl y improved during the course of the three years between accreditation dates with regard to the analysis of critical events, quality development and policy as well as complaint management. The accreditation result was better overall for the intervention group at the second time of measurement than for the comparison group that had not yet been accredited at that time in the study12. In 2015, a Swiss longitudinal study was conducted amongst 45 primary care practices that had been accredited by the EQUAM Foundation according to EPA standards, confirming the benefit of practice accreditation in supporting ongoing development of practices. The data used for the assessment was taken from practices that each received accreditation according to EPA standards three times in intervals of three years. Significant improvements were noted in the areas of quality and safety, as well as information and quality per se. The total score of the overall 129 indicators improved considerably between the measurement dates13. A randomised case- control study on the effect of accreditation on a patient level with a total of 1,252 practices, is currently underway in Denmark, where accreditation of primary care practices has been mandatory since 201614. The results of this comprehensive study, which is representative of the Danish healthcare system, is highly anticipated. Key r ecommendations As shown above, there are many arguments in favour of practice accreditation. Thus, 6 favourable conditions for practice accreditation to leave the status of a niche product that it has had until now in Switzerland, and spread wider should be built . Considering a legislation that makes practice accreditation mandatory should be amongst them . In order to be accepte d, the criteria for practice accreditation must address the culture and the organizational needs of the practice. Therefore, t he key success factor for the development of accreditation programmes - be they voluntary or mandatory - is certainly the involvem ent of practice experts in t he development process. Especially - but not only - larger group practices should consider the benefits of a practice accreditation in terms of organizational development and business organization. Conclusion Although accreditation alone is no guarantee of quality, it makes proper medical services considerably more likely through compliance with appropriate requirements. Above all, it enables practices to promote a culture that is rooted in constant quality development and improvement. Compared with Denmark, for example, where practice accreditation has been mandatory since 20169, in Switzerland, accreditation of medical practices is still a niche status after nearly 20 years despite its success . This relative success is due to its direct benefits and not in least to the reward of their cost efficiency by some health insurers in the area of integrated care. Specific regulatory requirements regarding practice accreditation or proposed legislation in this direc tion are currently not underway in Swiss healthcare policy. This is surprising. Accreditation of medical practices significantly contributes to making services in outpatient care effective, appropriate and economical, thus implementing the requirements of Article 32 of the Health Insurance Act. For the outpatient sector in particular, accreditation by means of an audit conducted by an external specialist is a suitable measure for creating transparency and allowing for an independent review of practice data. This is not the case for quality programmes based exclusively on self - declaration. Accreditation requires a certain amount of costs and effort that is certainly easier to manage for larger practices than for smaller ones. At the same time, larger practi ces often need to make processes more efficient through structuring and ongoing quality development. It remains to be seen whether the current trend towards more group practices will also lead more practices to decide in favour of accreditation and subsequent further development processes.

Swiss National Report on Quality and Safety in Healthcare Contribution by the Swiss Nurses Association to the Swiss National Report on Quality and Safety in Healthcare. Approved by the ASI Board on 18.01.2019 2 Abstract The Swiss Nurses Association (ASI) has prepared a short report as a contribution to a Swiss national report on quality and safety in healthcare, with a nursing care perspec- tive and focus . In Switzerland, a part of healthcare quality is regulated via the Federal Health Insurance Act (LAMal) and via the Federal Act on the Electronic Patient Record (LDEP ). The healthcare education system is regulated via the Medical P rofession Act, the Health Care Professions A ct (LPSan ) and the Federal Act on Vocational and Professional Edu- cation and Training (VPETA ). At national level, several organisations focus on the development of quality of care. For example the Swiss National Association for Quality Development in Hospitals and Clin- ics (ANQ) or the national foundation Patient Safety Switzerland. The Swiss Academy of Medical Sciences (SAMS) acts as a bridge builder between science and society and produces recommendations and ethical guidelines for the healthcare sector . Additionally, the FIT -Nursing Care platform, the BEST Institute, the Cochrane Institute- Switzerland, the country's university institutes of nursing science, its universities of ap- plied sciences (HES) and the Careum Foundation al l promote the development and use of evidence- based practice (EBP). With regards to Switzerland's quality of care, the re- sults of ongoing studies such as ProQuaS, Intercare, MatchRN, SHURP and RESPONS are eagerly awaited. Via their guidelines and recommendations, associations of different health professions, interest groups or health leagues (e. g. the Swiss leagues for Alzheimer's disease or for palliative care) can all have a beneficial effect on the quality and safety of healthcare. These organisations have the ability to depoliticise debates and bypass Switzerland's regional diversity b y advocating the use of best practices nationally. Final ly, solid resear ch shows that the nurse -to-patient r atio as well as motivation and education of nurses have a major impact on patient safety and the quality of care. The WHO Global Strategy on Human Resources for Health: Workforce 2030, adopted at the World Health Assembly in May 2016, articulates one of its objectives around the linkage between investments in the health workforce and \"improvements in health outcomes, social welfare, employment creation and economic growth\", arguing tha t the investment in human resources for health can triple the results in terms of improved health out- comes, global health security and economic growth(1). ASI's contribution to the \"Swiss National Report on Quality and Safety in Healthcare Report \" provides a vision that places nursing care at the very heart of the efforts to im- prove healthcare quality and safety . After examining issues concerning the safety, quali- ty and effectiveness of care in Switzerland, it will discuss significant interventions, key factors for success and obstacles to improving quality and patient safety. Finally , it will highlight specificities of the Swiss healthcare environment which facilitate or hinder the development of quality and patient safety . Conflicts of interest The ASI hereby declares that it has no conflicts of interest with regards to this report . 3 1. What is known about the safety, quality and efficiency of care in Switzerland? The current situation in Switzerland Federal Laws and strategies The services referred to in articles 25 -31 of the Federal Act on Health Insurance (LAMal)(2) shall be effective, appropriate and economic. Efficacy shall be proven by scientific methods. The efficacy, expediency and efficiency of the benefits shall be re- viewed periodically. The government's overall strategy \"Health 2020\" aims to maintain quality of life, in- crease equal opportunities, raise the quality of care and improve transparency. National strategies such as the \" National Dementia Strategy 2014- 2019 \"(6) are contributing to the implementation of the overall national str ategy. Usually the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) and the Swiss Conference of the Cantonal Ministers of Public Health (CMPH) collaborate with experts and expert organizations in the field. Some of the na- tional strategies are underfinanced and there fore don't always have the expected im- pact. Similarly, the Federal Act on the Electronic Patient Record (LDEP) obliges hospitals and nursing homes to start using electronic patient records by 2020 and 2022 respective- ly(3). In 2014, the Interprofessional Working Group on Electronic Patient Records (IPAG) was constituted in order to prepare for the introduction of the LDEP. IPAG's pa- pers on cybermedicine (4) and on electronic patient transfer reports (5) now form the ba- sis for document exchange formats guaranteeing interoperability and are integrated into the LDEP's rules of application. These reports reveal the needs expressed by the dif- ferent professions concerned and will help to ensure higher quality electroni c patient records. A Federal Law on Prevention and Health Promotion(7) as well as the creation of a Swiss Institute for Quality Healthcare were in discussion but they never saw the light of day. The Swiss Nurses Association ( ASI) strongly support ed both plans . Following these projects , which have not been pursued any further , the creation of a Quality Net- work was discussed. T he current status of this project is not known to ASI . Activit ies by associations Several organisations operating at the national level also put the emphasis on patient safety and quality , for instance t he Swiss National Association for Quality Development in Hospitals and Clinics (ANQ )(8), the Swiss Academy for Quality in Medicine (ASQM )(9) and the Foundation Patient Safety Switzerland(10) . The Swiss Academy of Medical Sciences (SAMS) acts as a bridge builder between science and society and produces recommendations and ethical guidelines for the healthcare sector . Nursing personnel A dramatic shortage of Registered Nurses (RNs) and high fluctuation of the nursing personnel put the safety, quality and effectiveness of care(11,12) at risk . This results in hospit al readmissions, medical complications and even avoidable medical errors (13). Some examples of the challenges concerning fluctuation and shortages of health per- sonnel include the increasing complexity of work tasks combined with a reduction in the length of stays (13), the intensification of work (11,14) , 4 the multiplication of administrative tasks, a number of challenges around nurse migration and international recruitment (15). Evidence shows that in addition to the numbers of healthcare professionals the skills - and grade- mix in hospitals, nursing homes and other healthcare organisations have a major impact on patient safety, as well as on quality and effectiveness of patient care. Apart from the information about efficienc y and quality indicators, information about nurse- to-patient -ratios, fluctuation and employee satisfaction need s to be reflected in any system of stewardship of the health system, as they are central for good health outcomes (16). A focus on nursing care The Swiss Nurses Association (ASI) The ASI leads different approaches aiming at developing and ensuring quality in nurs- ing care: In 2017, the ASI and its allies submitted a federal popular initiative entitled \"For a strong nursing care\" (17), after having collected 120,000 signatures in eight months. The initiative 's objectives are to ensure a good quality nursing care for all in Switzer- land, to implement effective measures against the shortage of nursing personnel and to upgrade the profession's status . The ASI is part of the international \"Nursing Now Campaign\" (18) launched by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the International Council of Nurses (ICN) , Nursing Now(18,19) , a three -year global campaign (2018- 2020), aims to improve health by raising t he profile and status of nurses worldwide. The ASI publishes brochures/information directly or indirectly linked to the quality of nursing care, such as : o Les soins infirmiers en suisse - Perspectives 2020(16) , o Ethics and Nursing Practice (20), o Report on the Quality of Nursing Care in Switzerland(21) , o The Strategic Missions of Freelance Nurses (22), o Brochure on Documenting Care(23) , o Diverse ethical position papers (24). Education system The state ensures the quality of education, in particular by accrediting the study pro- grammes run by u niversities and a system of quality assurance for other education insti- tutions in healthcare based on the following national laws: the Federal Act on Vocational and Professional Education and Training (VPETA) (25) which covers secondary level vocational education and colleges of higher education (ES), the Health Care Professions Act (LPSan) (26) which includes the regulation of educa- tion and professional practice of health professions educated in Universities of Ap- plied Sciences (HES). the Federal Act on Funding and Coordination of the Swiss Higher Education Sector (HEdA )(27) which provides the legal basis for medical universities . Institutions promoting quality in nursing care The subject of the quality of care is also covered by the FIT-Nursing Care platform (28), the BEST Institute (29), the institute Cochrane Switzerland(30) , the country's university institutes of nursing sciences , its Universities of A pplied Sciences (HES) and the Careum Foundation (31). All these organisations promote the development of the use of 5 evidence- based practice (EBP) by issuing good practice guidelines which enable healthcare professionals to integrate the latest research results into their daily practice. For example, FIT-Nursing Care (28) is a Swiss- German platform which provides direct access to the results of international research projects on nursing care that have been evaluated by experts. In French- speaking Switzerland, the BEST Institute(29) , which is certified by the Joann a Briggs Institute (JBI), is active in the development of evidence- based nursing care practice while t he institute Cochrane Switzerland(30) in Lausanne is internationally recognised. Measurement s and Indicators There is no sufficient number of nurse sensitive indicators . Some information concern- ing the quality of nursing care, providing points of comparison at the international level, can be found in the measurements of the ANQ (e. g. falls and pressure ulcers among children and adults or surgic al site infections ). The \"Swiss Care Excellence Certificate\" (SCEC) (32), a system of quality management developed by Concret SA in collaboration with the Universities of Applied Science of Bern and Win terthur, includes indicators which render the quali ty of nursing care visible and manageable. Research s tudies There are currently few studies on the efficiency and quality of nursing care. T he do- mains of homecare and psychiatric care are particularly under -researched. National and international studies , however, have demonstrated the positive repercus- sions on the quality of care given to patients and on their safety if nurses spend more time caring for patients and if the number of nurses in care tea ms is increased . Indeed, each 10% reduction in the proportion of nursing per patient staff has been associated with a n 11% increase in the risk of death(33) . Therefore economic analyses indicate that an increase in nursing personnel improves the quality of care while reduc ing the risk of complications or death as well as reducing the duration of hospital stay s and the risks of readmission(33) . Conclusion: Increasi ng the number of nursing staff will improve the quality of the healthcare system and lower its costs (33). 6 2. What significant quality and safety improvement interventions have taken place in the Swiss healthcare system ? Switzerland There is limited stewardship concerning quality and safety improvement at national lev- el. Plans to set up a national institute for health and care excellence were not supported by main stakeholders. Different associations and other players are, in a more or less coordinated manner, active in this field. However, t here are v arious interventions and measures in Switzerland in order to improv e the quality and safety of care: The Federal Statistical Office(34) the national centre for public statistics produces and disseminates key statistical information showing the current status and trends, for instance in fields \"health of the population, diseases and the health system \", in- cluding data concerning health personnel. They also carry out comprehensive analy- sis and devise indicator systems . This office fulfils the requirements for safe data col- lection and its publications should be a key element for the stewardship of the Swiss health sy stem. As part of its mission to ensure the rights of and respect for patients, the Foundation Patient Safety Switzerland created the platform Critical Incident Reporting System platform (CIRS ) and Critical Incident Re porting & Reacting NETwor k (CIRRNET )(35). This structures help to develop new recommendations and to distribute \"quick-alert\" warnings (36), thus ensuring a culture of safe care, quality and interprofessional co- operation(35) . The Alliance Peer Review CH consisting of the FMH (Swiss Medical Association ), Swis s Nurse Leaders (nursing directors association) and H+ (Swiss Hospitals ) pro- motes uniform and interprofessional peer review based on routine data. The Quality Medicine Initiative (IQM) was introduced to Switzerland from Germany in 2014- 15 and adopted as standard in 2016. A similar procedure is being designed for psychiat- ric care (37). The Swiss Medical Board(38) is an association bringing together various Swiss in- stitutes and organisations . Its goal is to make the best possible use of the healthcare system's resources in order to provide patients with an optimal quality of care. Swissnoso (39) is Switzerland's national infection prevention alliance, representing the k ey stakeholders in infection control making recommendations and collaborating with the Swiss Office of Public Health . Healthcare centres can search for accreditation, for example as \"Comprehensive Cancer Centres \" by the Swiss League Against Cancer, in order to demonstrate their high quality. Smarter medicine(40) aims to reduce healthcare costs by identifying any superfluous medical measures . Nursing care Like in the general system at national level , there is little stewardship and overall coor- dination concerning quality and safety improvements in nursing care. There is room for improvement concerning value based care and nurse- sensitive indicators. Some key elements of current activities and developments are described below. Education The integration of nursing education into the national education system represents a major improvement . Previously , the 26 cantons were responsible and had delegated the regulation of nursing education to the Swiss Red Cross. The edu cation of nurses in Switzerland is now part of Switzerland's tertiary educational level A, within the Bologna 7 system , including bachelor 's degrees (Universit ies of Applied Sciences , HES), master 's degrees and PhDs in nursing sciences . About two thirds of the Swiss nurses have a tertiary educational level B with diplomas from colleges of higher education (ES)(41). A newly created apprenticeship for healthcare assistants yields around 4000 certificates a year. Skills and grade- mix Another element of importance is the proportion of registered nurses (RNs)per patient (nurse -patient ratio) . A higher ratio of nurses per patient can be associated with better results and outcomes for patients and nurses whereas a reduction in qualified nursing staff and their replacement by care ass istants or auxiliaries increases the number of cases of avoidable death, lower s the quality of patient management and patient s afety and worsens the shortage of nursing personnel (42). Furthermore , numerous studies and meta- analyses have demonstrated that for chronic illnesses, the results of patient management by specialised nurses are at least equiva- lent to those of patient management by physicians . This was also confirmed by a sys- tematic review carried out by the University of Zurich's Institute of Primary Care (43). Certif ying nursing care quality Currently, Concret's Swiss Care Excellence Certificate is the only quality certification procedure for nursing care. The certification cycle allows expert appraisals and evalua- tions as well as certifications in a variety of institutions. As a result, direct improvements are being implemented in those institutions (32). The quality of nursing care and the ANQ (8) The quality of nursing care influences the results of the ANQ's national quality indica- tors and measurements . There are, however, few publications about nursing centred interventions to improve quality and safety . Research s tudies Several research studies , such as ProQuaS (44), MatchRN(46), SHURP (47) Respons and Respons -Fam(48), will provide results concerning quali- ty. 8 3. What are the results and what is known about their sustainability? Switzerland ANQ's measurements help to raise awareness among managers , nurses and other health professionals in leadership positions concerning the quality of care , thus setting off a learning process that aims at improvements (49). Curaviva , the national association of care home directors, was mandated by the Feder- al Office of Public Health to devel op quality indicators (QI) for long -term inpatient care (50). The ASI regrets the absence of clinical governance, that no nurses' organisation was involved in the development of the QI and that key decisions were made by man- agers. ASI is involved in the development of i ndicators on home based care with the Resident Assessment Instrument (RAI)(51) . Spitex Schweiz has the leadership in this project. The measures mentioned do not always necessarily lead to interventions or allow or- ganisations to intervene on their own. In consequence, there is currently no available overview of all these diverse interventions and their outcome. From a scientific point of view, there is limited evidence concerning the results and the sustainability of the differ- ent approaches. There are no mandatory certification process es (e. g. International Or- ganization for Standardization (ISO); norms for total quality management and magnet hospital s). No institution exists, like t he National Institute for Health and Care Excel- lence (NICE) in the U nited Kingdom, which establishes clinical standards for health and social services applicable across the whole country (52). Nursing care The ASI collabor ates with the different partners mentioned under question 2, e. g. with Swissnoso on training workshops on the prevention of infection. However, the ASI does not have precise information on the results of interventions on safety, quality and effectiveness of care. 9 4. What are the key factors of the success of these intervent ions? Switzerland One k ey factor is the definition of the right interventions for specific settings and their standardised use across the country. Switzerland is a country with the means to achieve good quality, e. g. to invest in highly qualified and well -trained healthcare per- sonnel . Furthermore, the Swiss Medical Board aims to reduce unnecessary interven- tions and save costs(38) . Finally, the new Health Care Professions Act (LPSan) (26) provides a necessary and very precise framework for professional practice and educa- tion. Nursing care Quality concept The ASI, in collaboration with one of its specialised ass ociations , Curacasa, is respon- sible for freelance nurses . This includes a responsibility for the quality of the services independent nurses provide. The quality programme(53) contains a training session on quali ty standards and an annual quality refresher -day as well as a self -evaluation and an external evaluation o f quality, carried out by Curacasa and Concret . The result is a whitelist of freelance nursing personnel who fulfil the quality criteria set out by the ASI and Curacasa . Professional competencies Another factor of success is e-log(54), a platform created jointly by the ASI and the Swiss Federation of Anaesthetist Nurses . The platform allows nurses to prove their pro- fessional competencies with the aid of an electronic curriculum vitae . The e-log diary and the e- log points system certify the quality of the training nurses participate in. E -log is a response to the requirements of the LAMal and a very important tool for the docu- mentation of continuous professional development (CPD). With the Health Personnel Professional Act there will soon be a legal basis in place to make the CPD mandatory (2019 or 2020) . 10 5. What are the barriers and challenges that they encountered? Switzerland The Swiss Confederation and the cantons have put forward ideas about achieving quali- ty, but without specifying neither precise indicators of success nor evaluation pro- grammes to be used. And t here is little money available for financing the proposed measures . For instance, there is competition between hospitals which can lead to lowering base rates for making more profit. As a consequence the number of health professionals might be reduced and skilled workers replaced by les skilled persons w ith lower sala- ries. The fragmentation of responsibilities for healthcare services and the shifts in staff- ing are obstacles to the development of quality . Nursing care The main obstacles and challenges nursing care is facing are: the lack of personnel, poor working conditions, low salaries (compared with other professions in Switzerland, with similar education) limited possibilities of reconciling professional and private live, low nursing staff retention(17,55) . 11 6. What are the specificities of Switzerland's environment that facilitate or hinder these interventions? The Swiss decentralised healthcare system has advantages and disadvantages. Firstly, the diversity of healthcare policies in Switzerland is a hindrance when it comes to apply- ing a national decision linked to the quality of care in every canton. Cantonal pilot pro- jects are sometim es easier to carry out than national projects which are far more com- plex. Empirically, by way of example, Quafipa(56) , in the canton of Fribourg, had posi- tive results. Projects should also be developed with close regard to the needs of a can- ton's population: the needs of the populations of the canton of Obwalden (rural envi- ronment) or the canton of Bern e (urban environment) are not necessarily identical . The fact that the care services offered can be adapted to the population's need favours a democratic control (through Switzerland's highly devolved cantonal and communal di- rect democracy system) . Prevention, health promotion and the prevention of natural catastrophes or pandem- ics(57) are mainly dealt with at the national level . These types of interventions are com- plex to manage because directives must be applied across Switzerland's 26 cantons . In case of emergencies measures can be made compulsory. The intertwined tasks of the Swiss Confederation, its cantons and communes make it extremely complex to implement potentially successful interventions to improve quality and safety in the field of public health. A further obstacle is the multiplicit y of actors in the domain of the quality of care, which makes it extremely difficult to coordinate e. g. the care for patients suffering from chronic illnesses. In addition to this, certain actor s and political parties would prefer the entire healthcare system to be controlled by the market . This does no t always lead to efficiency and car- ries the risk that significant amounts of financial resources ( taxes and mandatory health insurance payments ) destined for care go to private companies (h ospitals, nursing homes , industries) and their shareholders (58,59) . Final ly, the recommendations made by professional associations , interest groups and health leagues (ASI, Alzheimer 's Switzerland , Palliativ.ch, etc.) can have beneficial ef- fects. These organisations depoliticise debates and they can bypass Switzerland's re- gional diversity by advocating the systematic use of best practices across the country . It would be important to encourage the cantons to refer to these best practices in their own legislation. 12 7. Recommendations The Swiss Nurses Association recommends the following : To create an overview of all the diverse organisations and activities and to de- scribe if and how the y influence q uality and safety in health care. To create a national institute for patient safety and quality in healthc are, like the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the United Kingdom, which establishes clinical standards for health and social services applicable across the whole country(52) . If this is not feasible politically an extra parliamen- tarian commission for patient saf ety and quality of care could be an alternative. To collect enough of the right data on structure and performance of the different settings. Data analysis and publication should be carried out by the Federal Sta- tistical Office . To define and formulate i ndicators and measurements with both parties con- cerned: professionals and patients. Specific recommendations concerning patients: Besides the measurement of outputs and outcomes there is a need to further develop and consider the measurement of the quality of life. Patient reported outcome measures (PROMS) and patient reported experience measures (PREMS) are developed and systematically measured in Switzerland. Specific recommendations concerning nurses: With 90 000 active nurses, this professional group is the biggest among health care and nursing care providers. For good stewardship of the health system more information about nursing care, e. g. nurse sensitive indicator s, needs to be collected and evaluated. The Swiss Confe deration and the cantons are committed to ensuring enough nurses per patient as well as to providing motivated and well educated nursing personnel, as these factors have a major impact on patient safety and the quality of care . The WHO Global Strategy on H uman Resources for Health: Workforce 2030, adopted at the World Health Assembly in May 2016, articulates one of its objectives around the linkage between investments in the health workforce and \"improvements in health outcomes, social welfare, employment c reation and economic growth\", arguing that the investment in human resources for health can triple the results in terms of improved health outcomes, global health security and economic growth(1). 13 8.

Reasons why the role of clinical pharmacologists and toxicologists will continue to gain importance are presented, and six concrete recommendations to improve medication saf ety in Switzerland are provided: 1) enhance collaborati on, 2) facilitate research, 3) promote teaching, 4) c reate a national coordinating body , 5) c learer commitment to a nati onal strategy and priority, 6) preserve the national pharmacovigilance system. 3 The work of clinical pharmacologists and toxicologists and their contribution to improve medication safety Introduction Clinical pharmacology and toxicology deals with the study of drugs in humans and has a focus on the applicati on of pharmacological principles and methods in the real world. Working for the quality and safety of drug prescription represents a core raison d'\u00eatre of this discipline among the medical specialities. Current situation A very comprehensive and detailed summary of the current state o f medication safety in Switzerland, including a critical appraisal of the specificities of the Swiss Healthcare environment , the improvement interventions that have taken place and their results, was recently published by authors from the Swiss Patient Saf ety Foundation (Fishman et al., Bundesgesundheitsbl .). For this reason, the present report will directly focus on initiatives and activities of clinical pharmacologists and toxicologists to improve drug safety without summarizing again the current state of the field. Critical steps in medication safety Clinical pharmacologists and toxicologists contribute significantly to drug safety and the reduction of medication errors and related harm in a multitude of ways , with interventions to prevent adverse drug e vents at both provider - and system -level, that can be summarized by the goal to \"treat the right patient , with the right drug , using the right dose, by the right route, and at the right time\", according to \"The Five Rights of Medication Administration\" of the Institute for Healthcare Improvement. The relevance of these critical steps in medication safety has already been recognized some decades ago, as Alphonse Chapanis studied medication- related errors in a 1100- bed hospital and identified seven sources of such errors potentially leading to patient harm: \"medicine omitted, or given to the wrong patient, at the wrong dose, as an unintended extra dose, by the wrong route, at the wrong time, or as the wrong drug entirely\". These errors unfortunately still happen worldwide, and Switzerland is no exception, and are a leading cause of injury and avoidable harm globally. T his is the reason why the World Health Organization has launched on March 29, 2017, at the second Global Summit of Health Ministers on Pati ent Safety in Bonn, Germany, the Third Global Patient Safety Challenge Medication Without Harm, which has the goal to reduce the level of severe, avoidable harm related to medications by 50% over 5 years, globally. Two Swiss clinical pharmacologists and toxicologists from the Swiss Society of Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology ( SSCPT ) have an active role in this Challenge, with the author of this report acting as expert. Errors can occur at different stages of the medication use process , i.e. drug prescribing, transcribing, dispensing, administering and monitoring. The errors identified as such during the medication process may not represent the only problematic aspect of drug treatment. Actually, some presc ription applied rigorously without any deviation may still prove definitely noxious to patients e.g. when the indication is questionable, when the information supporting prescription is flawed by unsatisfactory clinical studies, when elements governing drug choice and/or dosing decisions are suboptimal, when knowledge about adverse drug 4 reactions is missing , etc. The perimeter of potential issues regarding drug safety thus goes largely beyond the encounter of the patient with health professionals. Activities , interventions and initiatives to improve medication safety In the following paragraphs , the multiple interventions and contributions of clinical pharmacol ogists and toxicologists to address the frequency and impact of medication errors, and fight this serious source of avoidable harm , disability and death, will be briefly presente d. It is however important to recognize and to underline that although m ultiple interventions and approaches have already been developed and deployed, yet their imp lementation is varied and this is mainly due to the fact that in Switzerland there are not enough clinical pharmacologists and toxicologists, who are mainly based in the five divisions of clinical pharmacology and toxicology in the university hospitals (of Zurich, Bas el, Bern, Geneva, and Lausanne) . A positive development was the creation in June 2015 of the Division of clinical pharmacology and toxicology in Lugano, which was subsequently followed by the opening of the Institute of Pharmacological Sciences of Southern Switzerland, which is serving all hospitals of the EOC hospital network and combines clinical pharmacology and toxicology , pharmacovigilance ( regional pharmacovigilance centre ), clinical pharmacy, pharmacoepidemiology, pharmacogenetics, hospital pharmacy and public pharmacy, and is offering support, consultancy and training to different hospital -based healthcare professionals and general practitioners fr om the region of southern Switzerland. Within this institute, clinical pharmacologists and toxicologists work closely together with clinical pharmacists and hospital pharmacists, and the cooperation is good and very effective. This is the first time in Switzerland that all these units are joined within the same institute and the hope is that others will follow, further promoting interprofessional collaboration to the benefit of safe pharmacotherapy for our patients . Some important activities , interventions and initiatives of clinical pharmacologists and toxicologists to improve drug safety in Switzerland are: - Involvement in patient care Active involv ement in patient care as consultants , and in some cases by providing direct patient counselling and by participating o n ward rounds , providing recommendations to improve pharmacotherapy in individual patient s (provider -based approach as e.g. medication review and substituting, if possible , high -risk drugs , discontinuing unnecessary drugs (deprescribing) , preventing and treating adverse drug reactions, preventing drug -drug interactions, adjust ing dosing based on age and creatinine clearance, and address ing non-adherence). - Computerized physician order entry and clinical decision support systems Contribution to the development and implementation of computerized physician order entry systems (CPOE) and integration and development of clinical decision support systems (CDSS). - Contributions to pharmacovigilance Numerous activities related to pharmacovigilance, in close collaboration with the Swiss Agency for Therapeutic Products Swissmedic, including prevention, detection, diagnosis , evaluation with causality assessment and treatment of adverse drug 5 reactions, as the six regional pharmacovigilance centres of Sw itzerland are located within the Divisions of clinical pharmacology and toxicology . o It is worth mentioning that there have been some initiatives and innovative approaches in this field within the Divisions to increase the performance of the detection of adverse drug reactions, particularly in hospitals, and one of these has won the first national prize \"Innovation Qualit\u00e9\", patient safety category, of the Swiss Academy for Quality in Medicine of the Swiss Medical Association in collaboration with the Swiss Patient Safety Foundation and supported by 22 important organizations, faculties and national academies of the healthcare sector . o Furthermore, the regional pharmacovigilance centres have a long -standing scientific track record in pharmacoepidemiological r esearch with evaluation of safety signals from pharmacovigilance databases such as Vigibase\u00ae, the WHO global database of individual case safety reports. The centres have published numerous articles that report on important signals with an assessment of their impact based on such database analyses . - Personalized pharmacotherapy , pharmacogenetics , and therapeutic drug monitoring Services and counselling to personalize drug therapy (personalized medicine) , including prescription and interpretation of pharmacogenetic tests , with the aim to prevent, or decrease, toxicity and increase efficacy. Related to laboratory tests, also the interpretation of drug concentrations (therapeutic drug monitoring) to adapt pharmacother apy. - Choosing wisely / Smarter medicine The activities and interventions to optimize drug treatment, including avoiding unnecessary medications and paying attention to appropriateness, are well represented by some initiatives within the Choosing Wisely campaign/Smarter medicine , which are taking place in some regions of Switzerland. For example within the EOC hospital network in southern Switzerland, the approach has been based on data with a continuous transparent monitoring of new prescriptions; the focus has been placed initially on proton pump inhibitors and benzodiazepines, with very encouraging results , and now it is planned to include other medications as well . - Drug and therapeutic committees The substantial contribution to the activities of Drug and therapeutic committees , with, among other tasks , the definition of the hospital drug formulary and the elaboration of interventions and recommendations for rationale and safe drug prescribing. - Educational activities and interventions Educational activities and interventions for care teams , with a focus on physicians , on a range of topics related to medication safety and correct prescribing. - Teaching University t eaching, at pre- and post -graduate level , in clinical pharmacology and toxicology including drug safety for medical, pharmacy and biology students . - Research Clinical research with different approaches and study designs, including pharmacoepidemiology, on issues related to drug safety. For example, a relevant 6 topic in drug safety is m edication reconciliation - i.e. the process that identifies unintentional medication discrepancies, informs prescribing decisions, and prevents medication errors - which has been the subject of a national Prog ress! Programme. However , the evidence on the impact on patients' relevant outcomes is still inconclusive, and this was the rationale for starting the study Parallel group randomized controlled trial to assess the impact of medication reconciliation at hospital admission on healthcare outcomes , which is being performed i n close collaboration between clinical pharmacology and toxicology, clinical pharmacy and hospital pharmacy. Outlook The special and important contributions of clinical phar macologists and toxicologists for the well-being and safety of patients and the public have been summarized above. As the number of available medicines continues to increase, with biological therapies including immunotherapy, cell and gene therapies having a progressively more important and profound impact on contemporary therapeutics, the role of clinical pharmacologists and toxicologists will continue to gain importance. Related to drug safety, this is due to the fact that the safety and adverse effect prof ile of many of these new drugs is only partially known and also to some extent completely unusual compared to older drugs. Moreover, the impact of personalized medicine and pharmacogenetics is likely to further change the type and characteristics of therapeutics in the near future. Recommendations Enhance c ollaboration As there are not enough clinical pharmacologists and toxicologist to fix all drug safety issues, the collaboration with other physicians trained in disciplines such as paediatrics , geriatrics, internal medicine, oncology and psychiatry, but also the interprofessional collaboration with both clinical and hospital pharmacists, as well as other health professionals such as nurses, becomes of vital importance. These colleagues carry out much important clinical pharmacological practice to the benefit of drug safety, and this should be promoted and further enhanced. In particular , the close and active collaboration between clinical pharmacologists and toxicologists and clinical pharmacist s should be enabled and promoted, with the definition of clear duties and responsibilities based on competencies. This has been demonstrated to be possible and has proven very effective. The fear to lose power and influence is pointless and should be overc ome as the competencies are complementary but not equal , and all these professional figures are needed and will have an important role to play in Swiss healthcare, in order address all remaining drug safety issues and finally increase patients' safety . Facilitate research Another very important point would be to guarantee adequate financial support for clinical pharmacological and toxicological research in Switzerland focussing on drug safety issues, 7 e.g. pharmacoepidemiology, with dedicated structured programmes such as , for example, the National Research Programmes (NRPs) of the Swiss National Science Foundation. Promote teaching The importance of the training in clinical pharmacology and toxicology, including drug safety and safe prescribing, both at pre- and post -graduate level, cannot be overstated and should be clearly realised by both medical and p harmacy faculties of all Swiss U niversities. These principles should also be adequately included in the curriculum of other important health professionals such as nurses. Teaching should be uniform and ideally be based on \"model\" undergraduate core curricula in clinical pharmacology and toxicology, therapeutics and prescribing for students , such as those developed by IUPHAR and WHO, and also acknowledge the importance of interprofessionality. Create a national coordinating body for medication safety It would be of paramount importance to create a national coordinating body for drug safety initiatives in Switzerland , with a responsible person and with the involvement of all relevant stakeholders and institutions , so that the many useful and promising activities and interventions that are already taking place to different extents at hospital or regional (cantonal) level (e.g. implementation of medication reconciliation procedures, development and integration of CDSS) , will gain on coordination, relevance and durability. Clearer commitment to a national strategy and priority A clearer commitment to a national strategy and priority , and to recognize the relevance of medication safety from the political leadership at a national level, and also from the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health, would be important and very welcomed. This will also be relevant in order to make good use of all the opportunities that will derive from the digitaliz ation and the development of eHealth, with the widespread tion of electronic patient records (elektronisches Patientendossier, EPD ). Preserve the national pharmacovigilance system A relevant aspect of medication safety which is surely well organized and well functioning at a national level , with a good coordination with the cantonal and local level, is the Swiss pharmacovigilance system with the regional pharmacovigilance centres closely collaborating with Swissmedic . This system is regularly praised in the international context , and its high quality and efficacy is clearly recognized. It will be important to preserve this national pharmacovigilance system also in the years t o come. 8 Acknowledgments : The author would like to thank Prof. Thierry Buclin, MD, Lausanne , Prof. Gerd A.
