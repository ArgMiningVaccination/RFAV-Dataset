Sometimes people refer to these symptoms and conditions as long COVID, PASC (post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection), long-term COVID-19, or long hauler COVID-19. What we know about long COVID There is still a lot to learn about COVID-19 and long COVID. Many people with COVID-19 recover and return to their normal lives within a couple of weeks. Yet, some people may experience symptoms that last for weeks, months, or longer. We still don't know why some people get long COVID. But, we do know that long COVID can keep people from being able to do their usual daily activities. Who can get long COVID? Anyone who had the virus that causes COVID-19 can get long COVID, even children, young adults, and those who were not very ill when they had COVID-19. The best and only way to avoid getting long COVID is to protect yourself against COVID-19. Get vaccinated, wear a mask, physically distance, and wash your hands frequently. Stay safe and protect yourself against COVID-19. What is the cause of long COVID? While the exact cause is not clear and is still under investigation, some evidence has suggested that symptoms and conditions could be related to one or more of the following: - Chronic inflammation - Small blood clots - Dysregulation of the immune system - Generation of auto-antibodies - Organ damage - Viral persistence - Reactivation of other viruses (e.g., Epstein-Barr virus) - Sequelae of critical illness - Exacerbations of underlying health conditions What are the symptoms of long COVID? We are still learning about long COVID but the most common symptoms reported include: - Shortness of breath - Chest pain - Trouble sleeping - Difficulty thinking, concentrating, or remembering things (sometimes referred to as \"brain fog\") - Depression or anxiety - Joint or muscle pain - Tiredness or fatigue - Headache - Loss or change of smell or taste - Dizziness on standing - Fast-beating or pounding heart (also known as heart palpitations) - Cough - Fever - Symptoms that get worse after physical or mental work Is there a treatment for long COVID? There is currently no proven medication for long COVID, but health care providers can provide care to reduce symptoms of long COVID. For most people with long COVID, the goal of medical management is to optimize function and quality of life. Diaries and calendars might be useful to document changes in symptoms, especially in relation to potential triggers such as exertion (physical and cognitive), foods, menstruation, and treatments or medications. Such diaries and calendars can provide greater insight into symptoms and lived experience. There are reports that vaccination may improve symptoms of long COVID for some patients. More research will help to better understand these reports.
