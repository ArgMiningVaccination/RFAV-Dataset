Terminology Recommended healthcare personnel vaccinations Tdap Who? About Today? Healthcare Personnel (HCP) -All paid and unpaid persons working in health -care settings who have the potential for exposure to patients and/or to infectious materials Including body substances, contaminated medical supplies and equipment, contaminated environmental surfaces, or contaminated air. -HCP might include (but are not limited to ): Physicians Nurses Nursing assistants Therapists Technicians Emergency medical service personnel Dental personnel Pharmacists Laboratory personnel Autopsy personnel Students and trainees Contractual staff not employed by the health -care facility Persons not directly involved in patient care but potentially exposed to infectious agents that can be transmitted to and from HCP and patients -E.g., clerical, dietary, housekeeping, laundry, security, maintenance, administrative, billing, and volunteers Vaccine vs. Immunization Vaccine is derived from vaccinia -A virus that was used in smallpox vaccines -Thus , \"vaccination\" actually refers to the prevention of smallpox Immunization is a broader term that encompasses the use of any immunobiologic to prevent infectious diseases by inducing immunity -Immunobiologic is the antigenic substance or antibody containing preparation used to induce or produce immunity Active vs. Passive Immunization Active -Involves the development of antibodies or cellular immune response following administration of a vaccine or toxoid Passive -Refers to the temporary immunity that follows exogenous antibody administration Active Immunization Vaccines consist of live (usually attenuated, i.e., \"weakened\") or inactivated microorganisms or fractions thereof Toxoids are modified bacterial toxins Inactivated or killed immunobiologics may consist of -Whole microorganism (whole cell pertussis) -Detoxified antigen (hepatitis B) -Components of the organism (subunit influenza) Passive Immunization Sources of antibodies include -Human immunoglobulin (IG) -Specific immunoglobulin preparations E.g., Hepatitis B immune globulin [HBIG ] -Antitoxins E.g., diphtheria or botulinum antitoxin Why is Vaccination Important? An essential part of occupational health programs is to ensure HCP are protected against vaccine -preventable diseases ( can help protect -Patients -Visitors -Family -Others Disease prevention through immunization is much less resource intensive compared to exposure management and outbreak control *There were no cases of rubella, congenital rubella syndrome or polio reported to public health * **Date as of 04/03/2017** Who is the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP )? Candidates for ACIP membership are screened carefully prior to being selected to join the committee. Before recommending a vaccine the ACIP considers many factors, including the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine . The ACIP develops vaccine recommendations for children and adults that the CDC uses to set immunization schedules, the recommendations include -Age(s ) when the vaccine should be given -Number of doses needed -Amount of time between doses -Precautions/contraindications. https:// www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/downloads/adult/adult -combined -schedule.pdf Are There Federal or State HCP Vaccination Requirements? There are no federal requirements that HCP be vaccinated for or have immunity to any VPD, as for Can lead to serious complications and death In the United States, from 1987 to 2000, the most commonly reported complications associated with measles infection were -Pneumonia (6%) -Otitis media (7 %) -Diarrhea (8%) For every 1,000 reported measles cases in the United States, approximately one case of encephalitis and two to three deaths resulted Healthcare providers should suspect measles in patients with a febrile rash illness and the clinically compatible symptoms -3 Cs Cough Coryza Conjunctivitis Providers should immediately isolate and report suspected measles cases to their local health department and obtain specimens for measles testing -Measles virus can remain infectious in the air for up to two hours after an infected person leaves an area -Airborne Precautions http://www.immunize.org/askexperts/experts_mmr.asp Immunity to Measles (Rubeola) HCP Born 1957 and Later Two MMR separated by at least 28 days Serologic evidence showing a positive measles titer Two documented MMR vaccines and test negative or equivocal for measles are still presumed immune HCP Born before 1957 Presumed immune to measles HCPs encouraged to have two doses of MMR Arizona measles outbreak, 2008 In February 2008, an infected Swiss traveler sparked a measles outbreak in Arizona involving 14 cases -7 of whom were infected in healthcare facilities; measles was not suspected until after the index patient had been hospitalized, not isolated , for 2 days Of the 11 secondary cases who accessed healthcare -10 didn't receive a prompt measles diagnosis after rash onset -Only 1 was masked and isolated promptly 8231 people were potentially exposed -4793 were hospital or clinic patients and 2868 were HCP 25% of 7195 HCP who were screened lacked evidence of measles immunity -1583 underwent IgG testing 121 (11%) of 506 born <1957 were seronegative, including 1 who developed measles The two hospitals involved spent ~$800,000 responding to and containing the seven measles cases in their facilities Chen et al. J Infect Dis. 2011 Jun 1;203(11). Is Mumps An to 25% of persons with mumps have few or no symptoms *Droplet Precautions are a key component of healthcare prevention* Immunity to Mumps Born 1957 and later Two MMR separated by at least 28 days Serologic evidence showing a positive mumps titer Two documented MMR vaccines and test negative or equivocal for mumps are still presumed immune Born before 1957 Presumed immune to mumps HCP encouraged to have two doses of MMR Rubella Generally a mild illness with -Low-grade fever -Lymphadenopathy (lymph node enlargement) -Malaise (general feeling of discomfort, illness, or uneasiness ) Up to 50% of rubella virus infections are subclinical Droplet Precautions are a key component of healthcare prevention Complications can include -Thrombocytopenic purpura Bruising or purplish areas on the skin or mucous membranes caused by bleeding under the skin -Encephalitis Rubella Born 1957 and later One MMR.
