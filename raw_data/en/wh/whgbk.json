Discussion of how and why each recommendation was developed and the evidence report are contained in the full guideline at www.aaos.org /guidelines . Readers are urged to consult the full guideline for the comprehensive evaluation of the available scientific studies. The recommendations were established using methods of evidence -based medicine that rigorously control for bias, enhance transparency, and promote reproducibility. The summary of recommendations is not intended to stand alone. Medical care should always be based on a physician's expert judgment and the patient's circumstances, values, preferences and rights. For treatment procedures to provide benefit, mutual collaboration with shared decision -making between patient and physician/allied healthcare provider is essential. Conservative Treatments : Recommendations 1-6 RECOMMENDATION 1 We reco mme nd that patients with symptom atic osteoarthritis of the knee par ticipate in self-management programs, strengthening, low -impact aerobic exercises, and neuromuscular education; and e ngage in physical activity consistent with na tional guidelines. Strength of Recommendation: Strong Description: Evidence is based on two or more \"High\" strength studies with consistent findings for recommending for or against the intervention. A Strong recommendation means that the benefits of the recommended approach cl early exceed the potential harm and/or that the quality of the supporting evidence is high. Implications: Practitioners should follow a Strong recommendation unless a clear and compelli ng rationale for an alternative approach is present. RECOMMENDATION 2 We suggest weight loss for patients with symptomatic osteoarthritis of the knee and a BMI 25. Strength of Recommendation: Moderate Description: Evidence from two or more \"Moderate\" s trength studies with consistent findings, or evidence from a single \"High\" quality study for recommending for or against the intervention. A Moderate recommendation means that the benefits exceed the potential harm (or that the potential harm clearly exceeds the benefits in the case of a negative recommendation), but the quality/applicability of the supporting evidence is not as strong. Implications: Practitioners should generally follow a Moderate recommendation but remain alert to new information and be sensitive to patient preferences. 1 RECOMMENDATION 3A We cannot re comme nd us ing acupunc ture in patients with symptomatic osteoarthritis of the knee. Strength of Recommendation: Strong Description: Evidence is based on two or more \"High\" strength studies with consistent findings for recommending for or against the intervention.

RECOMMENDATION 13 We are unable to recommend for or against arthroscopic partial meniscectomy in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee with a torn meniscus. Strength of Recommendation: Inconclusive Description: Evidence from a single low quality study or conflicting fi ndings that do not allow a recommendation for or against the intervention. An Inconclusive recommendation means that there is a lack of compelling evidence that has resulted in an unclear balance between benefits and potential harm. 5 Implications: Practitioners should feel little constraint in following a recommendation labeled as Inconclusive, exercise clinical judgment, and be alert for emerging evidence that clarifies or helps to determine the balance between benefits and potential harm. Patient preferen ce should have a substantial influencing role. RECOMMENDATION 14 The practitioner might perform a valgus producing proximal tibial osteotomy in patients with symptomatic medial compartment osteoarthritis of the knee. Strength of Recommendation: Limited Description: Evidence from two or more \"Low\" strength studies with consistent findings, or evidence from a single Moderate quality study recommending for or against the intervention or diagnostic. A Limited recommendation means that the quality of the supp orting evidence is unconvincing, or that well -conducted studies show little clear advantage to one approach over another. Implications: Practitioners should exercise clinical judgment when following a recommendation classified as Limited , and should be al ert to emerging evidence that might counter the current findings. Patient preference should have a substantial influencing role. RECOMMENDATION 15 In the absence of reliable evidence, it is the opinion of the work group not to use the free - floating (un -fixed) interpositional device in patients with symptomatic medial compartment osteoarthritis of the knee. Strength of Recommendation: Consensus Description: The supporting evidence is lacking and requires the work group to make a recommendatio n based on expert opinion by considering the known potential harm and benefits associated with the treatment. A Consensus recommendation means that expert opinion supports the guideline recommendation even though there is no available empirical evidence th at meets the inclusion criteria of the guideline's systematic review. Implications: Practitioners should be flexible in deciding whether to follow a recommendation classified as Consensus, although they may give it preference over alternatives. Patient preference should have a substantial influencing role. 6 INTRODUCTION OVERVIEW This clinical practice guideline is based on a systematic review of published studies examining the nonarthroplasty treatment of knee osteoarthritis in adults. It provides recommendations that will help practitioners to integrate the current evidence and c linical practice, and it highlights gaps in the literature in need of future research. This guideline is intended to be used by appropriately trained physicians and clinicians who manage the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee. It also serves as an information resource for developers and applied users of clinical practice guidelines. GOALS AND RATIONALE The purpose of this clinical practice guideline is to evaluate the current best evidence associated with treatment. Evidence -based medicine (EBM) stand ards advocate for use of empirical evidence by physicians in their clinical decision making. To assist with access to the large resources of information, a systematic review of the literature in publication between April 2010 and May 2012 has been conducte d. It highlights where there is good evidence, where evidence is lacking, and what topics future research will need to target in order to help facilitate evidence- based decision making in the treatment of patients with osteoarthritis of the kne e. AAOS staf f methodologists assisted the physician/clinician work group in evaluating the exi sting literature so that they could formulate the following recommendations based on a rigorous systematic process. Musculoskeletal care is provided in many different setting s and by a variety of providers. We created this guideline as an educational tool to guide qualified physicians and clinicians in making treatment decisions that improve the quality and efficacy of care. This guideline should not be construed as including all possible methods of care or excluding acceptable interventions similarly directed at obtaining favorable outcomes. The final decision to use a specific procedure must be made after assessing all concerns presented by the patient and consideration of locality -specific reso urces . INTENDED USERS This guideline is intended to be used by orthopaedic surgeons and other healthcare providers managing patients with osteoarthritis of the knee. It serves as an information resource for medical practitioners. In gen eral, individual practicing physicians and clinicians do not have the resources required to complete a project of comparable scope and duration involving the evaluation of an extensive literature base. The AAOS intends for this guideline to assist treatmen t providers not only in making clinical decisions with their patients, but also in describing to patients and their loved ones why a selected intervention represents the best available course of treatment. This guideline is not intended for use as a benefi ts determination document. It does not cover allocation of resources, business and ethical considerations, and other factors needed to determine the material value of orthopaedic care. 7 Users of this guideline may also want to consider appropriate use cri teria (AUC) related to the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee. The focus of AUC that the AAOS began developing in 2012 is to determine the appropriateness of clinical practice guidelines for the heterogeneous patient population routinely seen in pract ice. The best available scientific evidence is synthesized with collective expert opinion on topics where gold standard randomized clinical trials are not available or are inadequately detailed for identifying distinct patient types. When there is evidence corroborated by consensus that expected benefits substantially outweigh potential risks exclusive of cost, a procedure is determined to be appropriate. Similar to other areas of medicine, evidence for the effectiveness of orthopaedic services is not always identifiable. An important distinction to make is that if available data is lacking or evidence is absent, a recommendation is not assumed to be ineffective. When the AAOS cannot recommend for or against an intervention, available data do not provide empirically -based direction on what course of action is best . If data are absent, medical necessity should prevail especially where the disease, disorder, or condition in question can result in loss of life or limb (which is one reason some recomme ndations incorporate expert opinion). The AAOS believes evidence- based medicine is an integral component of treatment decisions and that the best results are predicated on reciprocal communication between the patient and physician and an individualized re gimen where risks are minimized and benefits are maximized. Medical expertise that is informed by research and takes into account all possible options increases the likelihood that patients will recover effectively. PATIENT POPULATION This guideline is in tended for use with adults (ages 19 years and older) who have been diagnosed by a physician with osteoarthritis of the knee and are undergoing treatment. SCOPE The scope of this guideline includes nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic interventions for symptomatic osteoarthritis of the knee as well as operative procedures less invasive than knee replacement (arthroplasty). It does not provide recommendations for pat ients diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis of other joints, or other inflammatory arthropathies. ETIOLOGY Osteoarthritis results from an imbalance between breakd own and repair of the tissues in the synovial joint organ and occurs as a resul t of multiple risk factors including trauma, overuse, and genetic predisposition. INCIDENCE AND PREVAL ENCE The inciden ce of knee osteoarthritis in the United States is estimated at 240 persons per 100,000 per year. 8 BURDEN OF DISEASE Osteoarthritis (of any joint) was the primary diagnosis that led to 11.3 million ambulatory care visits in 2009. It was estimated that 9.9 million adults had symptomatic osteoarthritis of the knee in 2010. Risk factors of the condition increase with age, especially in women. A nywhere from 6%-13% in men and 7% -19% in women over 45 years of age have osteoarthritis of the knee, suggesting that the risk in women is 45% higher than in men. Genetics, large body mass, certain occupations, repetitive knee bending or heavy lifting, and hereditary vulnerability are other factors that increase one's risk of developing the disease. EMOTIONAL AND PHYSICAL IMPACT Older adults with self -reported osteoarthritis visit their physicians more frequently and experience greater functional limitation s than others in the same age group. The aging of the baby boomers, rise in rates of obesity, and greater emphasis on staying active among the elderly population suggest that the emotional and physical impact of knee osteoarthritis will continue to be wide spread. POTENTIAL BENEFITS, HARM, AND CONTRAINDI CATIONS Individuals with osteoarthritis of the knee often complain of joint pain, stiffness, and difficulty with purposeful movement. The aim of treatment is to pro vide pain relief and improve the patie nt's functioning. Most interventions are associated with some potential for adverse outcomes, especially if invasive or operative. Contraindications vary widely by procedure. Reducing risks improves treatment efficacy and is accomplished through collaborat ion between patient and physician. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE PRESENT AND PREVIOUS GUIDELINE S This updated clinical practice guideline replaces the first edition that was completed in 2008, \"Treatment of Osteoarthritis of the Knee (Non- Arthroplasty).\" There have been changes in the methods used to develop the current guideline including new processes for preventing bias that are outlined in the section, \"Preventing Bias in an AAOS Clini cal Practice Guideline.\" We incorporated network meta -analysis to compare pharmaceuticals of interest not evaluated in the published sources, and we have implemented more rigorous methods for evaluating quality and applicability (i.e. generalizability) of included studies. This update considered the literature that we previously examined as well as the empirical evidence published since the 2008 guideline. Changes in article selection criteria necessitated exclusion of some studies that were included in the first edition. The key di fferences are explained below. First, the inclusion of only original research a nd elimination of secondary analyses explained the major differences in recommendation strengths between the pr evious and present guidelines. Systematic reviews of the Osteoart hritis Research Society 9 International1,2 and Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) 3 were not included in this revised guideline since they comprised secondary analyses. Similarly, the Annual Reports of the Australian Orthopaedic Association Joint Replacement Registry (2004- 2007) were excluded after they no longer met inclusion criteria. Eliminating systematic reviews as described above resulted in the need to develop a consensus recommendation in place of an evidence- graded recommendation because the previous supporting evidence no longer met inclusion criteria for this guideline. A requisite four week follow up period and minimum study sample of 30 patients (increased from ten) were the other essential modifications to the selection criteria that changed the database. The complete listing of inclusion criteria for this guideline is detailed in the section, \"Study Selection Criteria,\" (beginning on page 13 ). 10 PREVENTING BIAS IN AN AAOS CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINE Clinical practice guid elines (CPGs) are sometimes met with skepticism because of perceived lack of objectivity. Shaneyfelt and Centor assert that most current guidelines have strayed from those originally intended by the Institute of Medicine (IOM)4 and that the IOM has been cr itical of CPG development processes because of questionable adherence to quality standards.5 The AAOS understands that only high- quality guidelines are credible, and we go to great lengths to ensure the integrity of our evidence analyses. The purpose of this section is to describe the Academy's process. Additional details of how we eliminate bias also appear in the methods section. The AAOS addresses bias beginning with the selection of work group members. Applicants with financi al conflicts of interest (COI) related to the guideline topic cannot participate if the conflict occurred within one year of the start date of the guideline 's development or if an immediate family member has, or has had, a relevant financial conflict. Financial COIs are not the only source of bias that can hamper the systematic development of a guideline. The IOM has noted that long time service on government committees or with private insurers, authorship of articles on guideline -related subjects, and one' s personal experiences likewise can cause diminished objectivity. 6 The AAOS establishes a guideline development team free of COIs. The individuals who conduct the literature searches, evaluate the strength of the included studies, and synthesize the data are vetted prior to formalizing their participation (see Appendix I for a list of the work group members and methodologists involved in the assembly of this guideline) . Hirsh and Guyatt7 assert that involving conflict -free participants is crucial. Our use of methodologists changes the traditional role of the clinicians involved in guideline development. The members of an AAOS work group serve as the content experts. One of their primary tasks is to frame the scope and provide structure for the systematic re view by developing preliminary recommendations (see below for further information). Another task is to develop the selection criteria of studies. The AAOS medical librarian conducts a comprehensive literature search based on the key phrases. Suggestions to include specific articles are not accepted at this time to reduce the subjectivity of ad hoc recommendations. Research analysts identify the full articles to be recalled and determine whether the inclusion criteria are met for each study. The clinician w ork group receives a detailed listing of the recalled articles with the reasons for inclusion or exclusion noted, and they make criteria -based modifications that they view as necessary. The purpose of this step is to promote the integrity of the guideline' s data set. Differences in perspectives at this stage are reconciled according to what is most clinically and methodologically appropriate. Articles that become included as a result of this step in the literature review are integrated into the data base as part of the empirical evidence. 11 The methodologists then appraise the quality and applicability1 of each included study. This step entails coding answers to a series of research -design based questions from which final ratings are aggregated. D etermination of the quality and generalizability criteria preceding guideline and recommendation topic s selection and the use of an automated coding scheme to quantify scientific merit of each study removes virtually all subjectivity from these ratings. Greater rigor is employed over other evidence grading systems. The definitions of each study grade are operationalized to eliminate the possibility of bias that would likely arise with appraisals that are otherwise not replicable. (See Appendix VI for a complete descrip tion.) There are more than 50 grading systems8 and few among them report the use of adequate safeguards to prevent bias even when rating the highest level of evidence.6 The AAOS system is somewhat stringent compared to the GRADE system9 when it comes to the final determination about the scientific strength of a study . Good interrater reliability is maintained by involving a second reviewer who independently appraises a sampling of 10% of the evidence base. The GRADE system allows the investigator to ident ify \"other sources of bias.\" Although eliminating bias is essential to appropriately evaluating evidence strength , determinations that occur retrospectively allow for possible post hoc criticisms of a study and would potentially diminish the a priori orientation and objectivity of the development of the guideline . The AAOS believes that an emphasis on eliminating bias is prudent and needs to be managed systematically . The AAOS system, unlike GRADE, also specifically addresses the issue of statistical powe r (i.e. number of patients enrolled). Low statistical power is a common problem in the medical literature10 that increases the likelihood of making false negative conclusions. We regard low power studies as very low quality, and do not consider them when formulating a final recommendation.2 Similar to the GRADE system, the AAOS will include observational studies after performing evidence syntheses to determine if they constitute the best that is available. We rely on using the best available evidence for s ubstantive value over lower strength findings since higher strength results are l ess likely to be contradicted in future studies. When including non- randomized controlled studies, prospective case series that meet a number of other quality -related criteria constitute evidence as is the case in the GRADE system. However, retrospective case series are not incorporated in our systematic reviews under any circumstances. The latter do not establish empirically testable comparisons or relationships a priori, are not based on systematic assignment of patients to treatment groups, and do not appropriately control for measurement bias. Including only prospective case series studies is consistent with our a priori orientation in the evidence grading system used by the AAOS. 1 Here we use \"quality\" as synonymous with \"risk of bias\" since the same methods are used to evaluate them. Similarly, we use the terms \"applicability\" and \"generalizability\" as synonyms. 2 We include low power studies in meta -analyses since one purpose is to overcome the low power of individual studies. 12 Also unlike the GRADE system, the AAOS will base recommendations on expert opinion when they concern necessary routine services for which the empirical evidence is lacking or when they are directed at preventing loss of limb or life. A consensus -based recommendation is issued only when the service in question has virtually no associated harm and is of low cost (e.g. a history and physical) or when the absence of direction could have catastrophic consequences. To prevent potential bias in recommendat ions based on expert opinion, we have established specific rules governing their use. 13 METHODS The work group met for the introductory meeting on April 25, 2010 to establish preliminary recommendations and search terms for the guideline's systematic review . A two-day final meeting convened on August 25- 26, 2012 where members voted on final recommendations following a review of the evidence, wrote the rationales, and approved the methodological contents of the guideline. FORMULATING PRELIMINARY RECOMMENDAT IONS Based on their expert views of what works best, with whom, and under what circumstances, the work group's prelimi nary recommendations establishes the focus of the syst ematic review and determines the contents for the final conclusions. Al l preliminary recommendations a re worded in the affirmative direction. Modifications to th e preliminary recommendations a re not permitted between the introductory and final work group meetings. Only editing in accordance with the best available evidence and AAOS rules for wordin g recommendations based on evidence strengths a re adopted. (See below for a discussion on language constructi on.) Modifications that require new literature searches or a re not evidence -based are also not permitted. FULL DISCLOSURE INFO RMATION The work group's preliminary recommendations are represented in this guideline and the empirical studies that the analysts examined are cited. The AAOS has always striven for total transparency in the guideline development process. STUDY SELECTION CRIT ERIA We develop a priori article inclusion criteria that a re our \"rules of evidence\" for the systematic review and meta- analyses. Articles that did not have the selection characteristics were not eligible to be included as evidence for purposes of this guideline. To be included an article had to meet the following selection criteria: Study was of osteoarthritis of the knee Study reported on 80% of the patient population of interest Article provided full report of a clinical study Retrospective non- comparative case series, medical records review, meeting abstracts, historical articles, editorials, letters, and commentaries were excluded Case series studies that gave patients the treatment of interest AND another treatment were excl uded Case series studies that had non -consecutive enrollment of patients were excluded Controlled trials in which patients were not stochastically assigned to groups AND in which there was heterogeneity in patient characteristics or outcomes at baseline AN D where the authors did not statistically adjust for these differences when analyzing the results were excluded All studies of \"Very Limited\" evidence strength were excluded 14 Composite measures or outcomes were excluded even if they were patient - oriented Case series studies were excluded if no baseline values were reported Study was published in a peer -reviewed journal Study had a sample of 30 or more patients per treatment group Study was of humans Study was published in English Study was published duri ng or after 1966 Study results were presented quantitatively Study treatment follow up period was at least 4 weeks At least 80% of the enrolled study population were 19 years of age or older For any included study that used \"paper -and-pencil\" outcome measures (e.g. SF - 36), only those that were validated were included [unless the outcome was identified a priori by the work group in the critical outcomes Delphi round] \"Paper and pencil\" outcomes reported by a single group of investigators (i.e. a single stu dy) were excluded Study was in vitro Study was not performed on cadavers When a study's time period was not the same as those examined by the work group (i.e. 0-2 weeks, 2 -6 weeks, etc.), assignment was made based on mean duration. If a range rather than the mean was provided, the upper end dictated the duration category. For example, time periods of 0- 4 weeks was categorized into \"2 -6 weeks\" (when applicable) as established by the work group. We did not incorporate systematic reviews, meta- analyses, or other guidelines not specified by the AAOS work group to avoid including studies that did not meet our own criteria for selection. Rather, we recalled individual studies if the abstracts suggested that they might cons titute evidence for one of our re commendations and also searched the bibliographies of published systematic reviews for any additional studies that potentially supplemented our evaluation. BEST EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS When determining the best available evidence, we first include the highest -strength studies available for the outcomes examined. If there are two or more high -strength studies, the recommendation grade is strong. In this case, moderate - and low - strength evidence do not influence the grade of the r ecommendation. If there is one high- or at least two moderate - strength studies, the recommendation grade is moderate. If there is one moderate - or at least two low - strength studies, the recommendation grade is limited. Inconclusive recommendation grades are assigned when there is one low -strength study, no evidence, or contradictory findings. In this case, the rules for using expert opinion are not applicable so consensus recommendations are not appropriate. Consensus based recommendations are established only when the strength of the evidence would otherwise be inconclusive and the rules for consensus recommendations apply. See the section on Consensus Recommendations in the guideline (page 21). 15 OUTCOMES CONSIDERED The work group identifies the critical outc omes that the recommendations a re to be based on prior to the literature search. Measures necessary to determine whether or not medical treatment is effective a re deemed critical and are listed in the evidence summary tables immediately following each recommendation. As an example, for Recommendation 12 the critical outcomes were: Pain Functional status Disability Other arthritis -related symptoms Please see \"Appendix III: Determining Critical Outcomes\" for a detailed description of the AA OS process. O ther important, although noncritical, outcomes reported by authors are evaluated as well. We analyzed 149 unique outcomes of which six were critical. LITERATURE SEARCHES We begin the systematic review with a comprehensive search of the li terature. Article s we consider were published prior to May 2012 in four electronic databases; PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. The medical librarian conducts the search using key terms determined from the work group's prelimin ary recommendations. We supplement the electronic search with a manual search of the bibliographies of all retrieved publications, recent systematic reviews, and other review articles for potentially relevant citations. R ecalled articles are evaluated for possible inclusion based on the study selection criteria and ar e summarized for the work group who assist with reconciling possible errors and omissions. The study attrition diagram in Appendix IV provides a detailed description of the numbers of identif ied abstracts and recalled and selected studies that were evaluated in the systematic review of this guideline . The search strategies used to i dentify the abstracts are contained in Appendix V. APPRAISING EVIDENCE QUALITY AND APPLICAB ILITY QUALITY As noted earlier, w e judge quality based on a priori research questions and use an automated numerical scoring process to arrive at fina l ratings. Extensive measures are taken to det ermine quality ratings so that they are free of bias. We evaluate the quality of e vidence separately for each outcome reported in every study using research design domains suggested by GRADE work group members and others.9,11 The GRADE evidence appraisal system i s used in the Cochrane Collaboration12 and has been developed for studies e valuating matched control groups. We incor porate a coding scheme adaptable to all research d esigns that involves incremental increases for: 16 Prospective design (evaluation of a priori hypotheses) Adequate statistical power Stochastic random assignment of patients to comparison groups Sufficient blinding to mitigate against a placebo effect Comparability of the patient groups at the beginning of the study Delivery of treatment in a manner where observed differences between the comparison groups could reasonably be attributed to the treatment Validated outcome measures Absence of investigator bias Each of the above quality domains is rated for possible fla ws based on up to four indicator questions that define them. See Ap pendix V I for a discussion of the AAOS appraisal system. Domains are conside red \"flawed\" if one indicator i s coded \"No\" or at least two defining questions a re \"Unclear.\" The Statistical Power domain is con sidered flawed if sample size i s too small to detec t at least a small effect size of 0.2. If there are flawed domains then the evidence quality i s downgraded according to the reductions shown in Table 1. As an example, the evidence reported in a randomized controlled tria l (RCT) for any given outcome i s rated as \"High\" quality if none of the domains are fl awed. If one to two domains are flawed, the rating i s reduced to \"Moder ate.\" If three or four domains a re flawed, the quality of evidence i s downgraded to \"Low.\" The quality of evidence i s reduced to \"Ver y Low\" if five or more domains a re flawed. As indicated abo ve, very low quality evidence i s not included in this AAOS guideline. Table 1. Relationship between Quality and Domain Scores for Treatment Studies Number of Domains With No More Than One \"Unclear\" Answer Strength of Evidence 0 High 1-2 Moderate 3-4 Low >5 Very Low The following flaws a re so detrimental that we appraise the evidence as \"Very Low\" quality regardless of the computed domain scores. Non-consecutive enrollment of patients in a case series Case series involving the administration of multiple treatments Heterogeneity in outcome measurement Low statistical power Quality is one of two dimensions that determines the strength of the final recommendations. 17 APPLICABILITY We rate the applicability (also referred to as \"generalizability\" or \"external validity\") of each outcome reported in the studies. As with quality, applicability ratings a re based on pre-established indicat ors that a re coded and scored algori thmically. Applicability is rated as \"High,\" \"Moderate,\" or \"Low ,\" based on the number of domains that a re flawed. A study i s rated \"High\" if none of the domains a re flawed , \"Low\" if all of the domains a re flawed, and \"Moderate\" in all other cases. See Appendix VI for a additional discussion of the AAOS appraisal system Table 2. Relationship between Applicability and Domain Scores for Treatment Studies Our a pplicability appraisal system is derived from the PRECIS instrument 21 originally intended for randomized controlled trials but also appropriate for other types of research design. It is comprised of 10 questions that are divided into four domains. The defining characteristics and domains are presented in Table 3. Table 3. Brief Description of the PRECIS Questions and Domains Question Domain All Types of Patients Enrolled Participants Flexible Instructions to Practitioners Interventions and Expertise Full Range of Experimental Practitioners Interventions and Expertise Usual Practice Control Interventions and Expertise Full Range of Control Practitioners Interventions and Expertise No Formal Follow -up Interventions and Expertise Usual and Meaningful Outcome Interventions and Expertise Compliance Not Measured Compliance and Adherence No Measure of Practitioner Adherence Compliance and Adherence All Patients in Analysis Analysis MINIMUM CLINICALLY IMPORTANT IMPROVEMENT Without consideration of clinical significance to patients , analysis of statistical significance is limited . The latter provides information about sample size and does not quantify the size of the effect that differentiates the treatmen t groups. Whenever the data is available, we identified minimum clinically important improvement (MCII) treatment effects in addition to statistical significanc e. The MCII reflects the smallest clinical change that is important to patients and recognizes that there are some treatment- related statistically significant improvements that are too small to be relevant . We incorporate d terminology based on Armitage et al.13 that is outlined in Table 4. See Appendix X IV for a visual presentation of the descriptive terms. Number of Flawed Domains Applicability 0 High 1, 2, 3 Moderate 4 Low 18 Table 4. Descriptive Terms for Results with MCII Descriptive Term Condition for Use Clinically Significant Statistically significant and lower confidence limit > MCII Possibly Clinically Significant Statistically significant and confidence intervals contain the MCII Not Clinically Significant Statistically significant and upper confidence limit < MCII True Negative Finding Not statistically significant and upper confidence limit < MCII Inconclusive Finding Not statistically significant but confidence intervals contain the MCII When MCII calculations from the specific guideline patient population a re not available, we use thresholds from the most closely related population for which published data exists . Although possible variability between diseases and subjectivity in what patients view as improvement can cause discrepancies, calculations of the MCII based on closely related populations function as a reasonable proxy for evaluating meaningful effects. The values we used for MCIIs are derived from the published literature. We used the effect si zes reported by Angst et al. to compute the MCII of pain (0.39) and function (0.37) for the WOMAC instrument 14 and calculated effect sizes reported in their data to compute the MC IIs of stiffness (0.39) and total score (0.40) . We also used data from the same study to calculate the effect sizes for the MCIIs of the Short Form -36 (SF -36) bodily pain (0.47), physical function ( 0.17), and role physical (0.26) composite scores .15 We used data reported by Tubach et al. to calculate the effect sizes for the MCIIs of t he Visual Analog Scale (VAS) pain (1.23) and global assessment (1.0) subscale scores . 16 For all calculated MCIIs, we standardized the effect sizes of the applicable instrument s by dividing the minimum clinica lly important difference from baseline to follow -up by the standard deviation of the mean baseline score. GRADE OF RECOMMENDAT ION The recommendation grades a re based on the strengths of evidence and express the confidence one can have in the final recommendations. Grades reflect how likely it is current findings will be replicated in future studies. They are assigned as \"Strong,\" \"Moderate,\" or \"Limited.\" We base evidence grades on the quality and applicability ratings, whether or not the studies report critical outcomes, and potential harm to patients. More specificall y, we begin by s etting the strength as equal to the quality of available evidence. High quality evidence i s preliminarily rated as \"Strong,\" moderate quality as \"Moderate,\" and low quality as \"Limited.\" The ratings are downgraded if the evidence i s: 1) of \"Low\" applicabi lity; 2) inconsistent (comprised of studies with discrepant findings or a high 19 degree of heterogeneity in the meta - or network meta - analyses ); 3) based on only one study; or, 4) lacking \"critical \" outcomes. Preliminary recommendation grades a re adjusted u pward if the evidence i s of \"High\" applicability or if the intervention is associated with decreased likelihood of catastrophic harm ( i.e. possible loss of life or limb). In the present guide line, reducing potential harm i s the reason that the evidence strength of one recommendation was raised . DEFINING THE STRENGTH OF THE RECOMMENDAT IONS Judging the strength of evide nce i s only one step in the process of arriving at the final grade of a guideline recommendation. The overall strength is also based on clinical appropriateness, volume of the evidence, benefit versus potential harm to the patient's well-being , magnitude of treatment effects, and available data on critical outcomes. It is highly unlikely that future evidence will overturn a recommendation supported by numerous high strength randomized controlled trials that show a large treatment effect. There is a greater likelihood for future evidence to contradict recommendations t hat are based on a small number of case series. Since RCTs tend to have higher scientific merit, they are usually associated with higher evidence strengths than case series studies . When determining strength, AAOS staff first assigns a preliminary grade for each recommendation that reflects the quality and applicability ratings as well as volume of the evidence. Work group members then modify the preliminary recommendation strengths using the 'Form for Assigning Strength of Recommendation (Interventions)' shown in Appendix VI . Table 6 on the following page describes the possible grades, definitions, and implications that can be assigned to recommendations. WORDING OF THE FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS To prevent bias in the way recommendations are worded, the AAOS uses specific predetermined language stems that are governed by the evidence strengths . The format of guideline language is shown in Table 5. Table 5. AAOS Guideline Language Guideline Language Stem Grade We recommend Strong We suggest Moderate The practitioner might Limited We are unable to recommend for or against Inconclusive In the absence of reliable evidence, the opinion of this work group is* Consensus* *Consensus recommendations are made only if specific criteria are met (see below). 20 Table 6. Recommendation Strengths, De scriptions , and Clinical Implications Evidence Rating Description of Evidence Strength Implication for Practice Strong Evidence is based on two or more \"High\" strength studies with consistent findings in support of recommending for or against the intervention. A Strong (positive) recommendation means that the benefits of the recommended approach clearly exceed the potential harm, and /or that the strength of the supporting evidence is high. A Strong (negative) recommendation means that the quality of the supporting evidence is high. A harms analysis on this recommendation was not performed. Practitioners should follow a Strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternativ e approach is present. Moderate Evidence from two or more \"Moderate\" strength studies with consistent results , or evidence from a single \"High\" strength study recommending for or against the intervention. A Moderate recommendation means that the benefits exceed the potential harm (or that the potential harm exceeds the benefits in the case of a negative recommendation), but the quality/applicability of the supporting evidence is not as strong. Practitioners should generally follow a Moderate recommendati on but remain alert to new information and be sensitive to patient preferences. Limited Evidence from two or more \"Low\" strength studies with consistent results , or evidence from a single Moderate strength study recommending for or against the interventio n. A Limited recommendation means that the strength of the supporting evidence is unconvincing, or that well -conducted studies show little clear advantage to one approach over another. Practitioners should exercise clinical judgment when following a recommendation classified as Limited , and should be alert to emerging evidence that might negate the current findings. Patient preference should have a substantial influencing role. Inconclu sive Evidence from a single low strength study or otherwise conflicting evidence that does not allow a recommendation to be made for or against the intervention. An Inconclusive recommendation means that there is a lack of compelling evidence that has res ulted in an unclear balance between benefits and potential harm. Practitioners should feel little constraint in following a recommendation labeled as Inconclusive, exercise clinical judgment, and be alert for emerging evidence that clarifies or helps to d etermine the balance between benefits and potential harm. Patient preference should have a substantial influencing role. Consensus The supporting evidence is lacking and requires the work group to make a recommendation based on expert opinion by considering the known potential harm and benefits associated with the treatment. A Consensus recommendation means that expert opinion supports the guideline recommendation even though there is no available empirical evidence that meets the inclusion crite ria in the systematic review. Practitioners should be flexible in deciding whether to follow a recommendation classified as Consensus, although they may give it preference over alternatives. Patient preference should have a substantial influencing role. 21 CONSENSUS RECOMMENDATIONS Consensus recommendations are based on expert opinion. While they are prudent in certain instances, their liberal use can cause a source of bias. When the AAOS uses consensus -based recommendations, we follow the procedures described by the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF). 17 In our view, t here are only two circumstances that warrant their use. The first is in the case of procedures that have virtually no associated harm, are of relatively low cost, and reflect routine clinical care. The second pertains to medical interventions that potentially prevent loss of life or limb. In making consensus -based recommendations, work group members consider: Preventable burden of disease Applications in current practice Potential harm that could result from providing a medical service Relative difference in costs of a recommended service over alternatives The AAOS employs additional rules to manage the potential bias that may influence consensus recommendations. First, the r ationale cannot contain references to studies that are not a part of the systematic review. Excluded articles are not viewed as evidence. Second, the final recommendation must use the language shown in T Table 5 that eliminates stating \"we recommend,\" \"we s uggest,\" or \"the practitioner might\" to avoid confusion with the evidence -based recommendations. Third, the rationale must address any apparent discrepancies in logic with other recommendations. For example, if a guideline does not endorse an intervention in some instances but the work group has nevertheless issued a consensus -based recommendation, the rationale must explain the reason for the d escrepancy in decisions. When a recommendation is equivocal (i.e., wh en the recommendation reads \"we are unable to recommend for or ag ainst \"), the explanation why cannot contain an implied recommendation. For example, in the case of a new device, drug, or procedure, the work group may not incorporate such statements as, \"Although treatment X appears to be promising, there is currently insufficient evidence to recommend for or against its use.\" The italicized phrase implies effectiveness in treatment X when \"not being able to recommend for or against\" implies that effect iveness remains undetermined. VOTING ON THE RECOM MENDATIONS The recommendations and their strengths are voted on using the nominal group technique. We present the details in Appendix VIII. Voting is conducted by secret ballot; work group members are blinded to the responses of the other members. If there is significant disagreement, negotiation takes place and is followed by up to an additional three rounds of voting. If the disagreements cannot be resolved, the applicable recommendation is not adopted. Lack of agreement is a reason some grades might be labeled \"Inconclusive.\" Formal vote by work group members was used to approve all of the recommendations. Only the work group chair is required to approve the rationales with the editing support of staff unless the evidence grade is consensus. However, the rationales for this guideline 22 were approved by the entire work group. All components of consensus recommendations require formal vote. STATISTICAL METHODS NETWORK META -ANALYSIS During evidence appraisal of this guideline Bayesian networ k meta -analyses (also known as mixed tr eatment comparison s analysi s) of randomize d controlled trials we re preformed to ascertain the comparative effectiveness of analgesic treatments not directly compared in the literature , as explained below . For all interventions connecte d in one network by pairwise relationships, i f there i s no direct evidence about two analgesics but they a re each compared to the same reference treatment then their relative effectiveness can be estimated based on their computable effects with the common comparator . Both direct and indirect comparisons contribute to the tota lity of evidence for selectin g the best choices of treatment. The mixed treatment comparisons analysis follows methodology described by Lu and Ades18 using Winbugs version 1.4. Network meta -analysis assumes that randomization within the individual trials is maintained . Additionally, it is appropriate when interactions and covariates that affect trial AB have similar effects on trial AC , and the same indirect effect BC could be obtained as if it had been evaluated as a true direct effect (i.e. third arm of the RCT ). Breaking random ization and permitting effect modifying hetero geneity leads to biased estimates of the indirect comparisons . Consistency, the second important assumption, helps to produce interpretable results along with the similarity requisite. Similarity is required of the treatment effects among studies ; consistency addresses the potential for significant variability between the direct and indirect comparisons . Networ k meta -analysis requires statistical consistency between the direct and indirect pairwise effects . We use the \"back calculation\" method as described by Dias et al. 19 summarized as follows. Indirect effect BC i s calculated as the difference between direct effects AB and AC and evaluated against the direct effect estimation fo r BC. The z - statistic for the difference between the dire ct and indirect effects of BC i s compared to a standard normal distribution to test the null hypothesis evaluating consistency. If statistical significance is found, then the model i s interpreted as having questionable reliability and is excluded from the data analysi s. The results of the tests of statistical consistency betw een the direct and indirect comparisons of the pairs of analgesics examined in this guideline indicated that the consist ency assumption was met; the output summary can be found in Appendix XIII. Network meta -analysis is based on multiple pairwise comparisons across at least three RCTs that connect at least three interventions where there is at least one closed loop (i.e. common comparator; direct comparison) . It is an extensi on of traditional meta -analysis that incorporates a process where the outcome of a given comparison can affect the next outcome requiring the convergence of Markov chains that is based on this type of sampling . A total of k-1 parameters are estimated that allow for multiple pairwise comparisons acr oss a range of k distributions. The results are assessed b y examinat ion of trace plots that grap hically display the values a parameter took during the runtime of the 23 chain . In general, for each network model we perform ed 100,000 iterat ions of which the first 50,000 we re discarded as \"burn in\" pre -convergence iterat ions. Occasionally models require d 100,000 bu rn-in pre-convergence iterations, which resulted in a total of 150,000 iterations. PLACEBO DATA REGRESSION ANALYSIS INCLUSION CRITERIA As part of the studies included in the full guideline, articles that met inclusion criteria for a supplementary osteoarthritis of the knee placebo project were also recalled. Selection criteria included: Studies written in English Placebo -controlled randomized controlled trial study design evalua ting treatment for knee osteoarthritis 80% of participants have osteoarthritis of the knee (or the results for those with knee osteoarthritis reported separately) Study reported patient -oriented outcomes (i.e. pain, function, global assessment) Study rep orted sufficient data from the placebo group to perform statistical analysis: baseline and follow -up measures or change from baseline measures, including measures of dispersion (95% confidence interval, standard deviation, or standard error) Withdrawal rat e of placebo group <20% (measured at each treatment follow up duration) Because of differences in inclusion criteria between the placebo data project and the full guideline , some articles were included only in the placebo study while others were a part of both. As an example, sample size 30 was not a selection criterion for the regression analysis but it was for the full guideline . We search ed placebo controlled trials relevant to all the recommendations for the following outcomes : WOMAC pain, stiffness, function, and total subscales, VAS pain, SF-36 role - physical and mental subscales , and the Lequesne Index. The only data available examined the treatment efficacy of osteotomy using the VAS ; so only placebo controlled trials that measured chang e in VAS pain following osteotomy were incorporated. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Data from 48 articles wer e extracted to predict differences between baseline and treatment scores in the experimental and placebo groups of two case series designed studies . Prais -Winsten regression analysis was conducted using STATA's XTP CSE command used specifically with panel data affected by heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation. S ince each observation represented study -level averages of VAS pain scores , the regression was we ighted by size of the study samples . 24 The initial regression mode l predicted change in VAS pain using pretreatment score, age, percent female, follow up duration in weeks, multicenter study (0 = yes, 1 = no), and allowance for concomitant treatment (0 = no,1 = yes) as independent variables. Blinding was not used as a predictor variable because patients were masked to the treatment assignment s in all but one of the studies. RESULTS Baseline VAS pain score, age, and duration of treatment follow up were the only statistically significant covariate s retained in the final model. For every one point increase in baseline VAS pain score, follow up VAS pain decreased by .32 millimeters ( p < .001) . A study population with baseline VAS pain score = 70 showed more improvement than one with baseline score = 60. There were negative coefficient s that reflected regression to the mean effec ts. Regression to the mean refers to the tendency for outlying va lues to become less extreme as large positive values decrease and extreme negative ones increase. Placebo treatments had a larger effect on study populations of older adults. For every one year increase in age, post treatment VAS pain score decreased by .30 millimeters ( p < .001). Similarly, VAS pain scores were significantly associated wi th duration of treatment follow up time. For every one additional week of treatment , VAS pain score s decreased by .123 millimeters ( p < .001). The final regression model was: VAS pain = 25.83 - .32(baseline VAS score) - 30(mean age) - .123(duration) NEW TO META -ANALYSIS IN THIS GUI DELINE: M INIMAL IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE (M ID) UNITS In following the Cochrane Collaboration me thod of systematic reviews we compute standardized mean differences otherwis e referred to as effect sizes, that are reported essentially in standard deviation units. The calculation describes the average change between the treatment and control groups taking into account the degree of dispersion within each of the two groups. W ider varia tion indicates that patients in both groups report improvements as well as no improvements. T reatment effects are adjusted mathematically to reflect this lower relative responsiveness . The calculations of MCII that we used were validated based on patients with knee osteoarthritis whose final outcome of treatment was, \"good, satisfactory effect with occasional episodes of pain or stiffness.\" Final response to treatment anchored by baseline value w as calculated for each patient. Our determinations of clinical significance required patients in the studies included in this guideline to achieve a change score comparable to that achieved by 75% of patients reporting good outcomes in the population (which amounted to about half of one likert rating on a five-point likert scale ). Knowing the threshold that identifies successfully treated patients , it was possible for us to discern clinically effective from suboptimal treatment effects. 25 One lesson learned in clinical practice guideline development is that while meta -analysis effectivel y pools the individual effect sizes by assign ing greater weight to studies with less variability and lesser weight to effects where dispersion is higher , there is still heterogeneity in the treatment effects that diminishes their data analytic interpretation and the output does not easily resonate with clinicians to whom they are meant to be relevant . Since it is the AAOS' intent to develop guidelines for the benefit of patients and healthcare providers, we have incorporated the use of MID units. When reported statistically, effect sizes are interpreted as: Effect Size Interpretation .20 Small .50 Moderate .80 Large Since theses values of are l imited usefulness to clinicians, we have also conducted m eta- analysis in MID units instead of standard deviation units. Instead of dividing the mean difference between groups of each study by its standard deviation, we divided each mean difference by the MID. The MID is the smallest difference in outcome score th at informed patients or proxies perceive as important when considering benefit and potential harm and that would lead the patient or clinician to consider a change in the course of treatment ( Guyatt et al. ). An MID of one -half of a likert rating on a five -point scale (i.e. equal to our MCII) is comparable to many empirical derivations of the MID [ presented by Dr. Guyatt at the FDA: Minimum Clinically Important Difference (MCID): Defining Outcome Metrics for Orthopaedic Devices meeting held on November 27 - 28, 2012]. By interpreting effect sizes in MID units, it is possible to assess whether or not an appreci able number of patients achieve clinically important benefits in the outcomes. Degrees of possible efficacy follow a norm al distribution so increasingly smaller effects below one MID unit reflect decreasingly lower likelihoods . In this guideline , when the overall treatment effect in meta -analysis wa s below .5 MID units, we conclude d that there was a low likelihood an appreciable number of patients achieved clinically important benefits in the outcomes. PEER REVIEW Following the final meetin g, the guideline draft undergoes peer review for additional input from external content experts. W ritten comments are provi ded on the structured review form (see Appendix IX). All peer reviewers are required to disclose their conflicts of interest. To guide who participates, the work group identifies specialty societies at the introductory meeting. O rganizations , not individuals , are specified . The specialty societies are solicited for nominations of individual peer reviewers approximately six weeks before t he final meeting. The peer review period i s announced 26 as it approaches and others interested a re able to volunteer to revi ew the draft. The chair of the AAOS committee on Evidence Based Quality and Value review s the draft of the guideline prior to dissemination . Some specialty societies (both orthopaedic and non- orthopaedic) ask their evidence - based practice (EBP) committee to provide review of t he guideline. The organization i s responsible for coordinating the distribution of our materials and consolidating their comments onto one form. T he chair of the external EBP committees provide s disclosure of their conflicts of inte rest (COI) and manages the potential conflicts of their members. Again, the AAOS asks for comments to be assembled into a single response form by the specialty society and for the individual submitting the review to provide disclosure of potentially conflicting interest s. The peer review stage gives external stakeholders an opportunity to provide evidence -based direction for modifications that they believe have been overlooked. Since the draft is subjec t to revisions until its approval by the AAOS Board of Directors as the final step in the guideline development process, confidentiality of all working drafts is essential . The clinical pr actice guidelines manager drafts the initial responses to comments that address methodology. These responses a re then reviewed by the work group chair a nd vice- chair, who respond to questions concerning clinical practice and techniques. The director of the Depart ment of Research and Scientific Affairs provides input as well . All comments received and the initial drafts of the responses ar e also reviewed by all members of the work group. All changes to a recommendation as a result of peer review are based on the evidence and undergoes majority vote by the work group members via teleconference. Final revisions a re summarized in a detailed report that is made part of the guideline document throughout the remainder of the review and approval processes. The AAOS believes in the importance of demonstrating responsiveness to input received during the peer review process and welcomes the critiques of external specialty societies . Following final approval of the guide line, al l individual responses a re posted on our website http://www.aaos.org/research/guidelines/guide.asp with a point -by-point reply to each non -editorial comment. Reviewers who wish to remain anonymous notify the AAOS to have their names de- identified; their comments, our responses , and their COI disclosures a re still posted. Review of the Treatment of Osteoarthritis of the Knee guideline was requested of 19 organizations and 18 external content experts were nominated to represent them. Sixteen individua ls returned comments on the structured review form (see Appendix X ). PUBLIC COMMENT After modifying the draft in response to peer review ers' input , the guideline is circulated for a 30 -day public comment period. Public commentators consist of members of the AAOS Board of Directors (BOD), Council on Research and Quality (CORQ), Board of Councilors (BOC), and Board of S pecialty Societies (BOS). The guideline draft is customarily sent to the AAOS BOD and CORQ for requested commentary whereas members of the BOC and BOS are solicited in advance for their interest and receive 27 materials upon request. Additionally, a copy of this guideline i s placed online ( in a dropbox) and notices a re sent to all members of the BOC and BOS instructing them on access during the Public Comment period. If warranted and based on evidence , the guideline draft is modified in response to the public comment s by the AAOS clinical practice guidelines unit and work group members. Changes that are made are summarized, and those who provide com ment are informed of the revisi ons that result from their review. As indicated above and similar to peer review modifications, c hanges following the public comment period must be based on the evidence. They are detailed in a summary sheet that accompanies the document throughout the final approval process. During the public comment period, 42 stakeholders returned the structured review form commenting on the clinical practice guideline (see Appendix X). THE AAOS GUIDELINE A PPROVAL PROCESS The work group submits the final guideline for ap proval by the Committee on Evidence Based Quality and Value , Council on Research and Quality, and Board of Directors. These decision -making bodies are described in Appendix II and are not designated to modify the contents . Their charge is to approve or reject its publication by majority vote . REVISION PLANS This guideline represents a cross -sectional view of the cu rrent literature and may become outdated as additional information becomes available. Future editions will be developed in accordance with new evidence, changing practice, rapidly emerging treatment options, and advances in technology. The Treatment of Ost eoarthritis of the Knee 2nd Edition guidel ine will be updated or withdrawn in five years in accordance with the standards of the National Guideline Clearinghouse. GUIDELINE DISSEMINAT ION PLANS The primary purpose of this guideline is to provide interested readers with comprehensive documentation about our recommendations and the process followed to develop them . All guidelines are available at HUhttp://www.aaos.org/research/guidelines/guide.a sp UH. Shorter versions of the guideline are available in other venues. Publication of a guideline is typically announced during an Academy press release, and published in articles authored by the work group in the Journal of the American Academy of Orthopa edic Surgeons and AAOS Now. Most guidelines are also showcased at the AAOS Annual Meeting on Academy Row and as part of the Committee Scientific Exhibits. Selected guidelines are disseminated by webinar, website, radio, briefings and continuing education. Examples include an online module for the Orthopaedic Knowledge Online website, radio media tours, media briefin gs, and AAOS' continuing medical education (CME) curriculum and Resource Center. 28 Other dissemination efforts outside of the A AOS include submission to the National Guideline C learinghouse and to the Guidelines International Network database, a s well as distribution at the annual meetings of other medical specialty societies. 29 Figure 1. AAOS Clinical Pract ice Guidelines Development Process 30 AAOS CLINICAL GUIDEL INE ON TREATING OSTEOARTHRITIS OF TH E KNEE GUIDELINE R ECOMMENDATIONS RECOMMENDATION 1 We reco mme nd that patients with symptom atic osteoarthritis of the knee par ticipate in self-management programs, strengthening, low -impact aerobic exercises, and neuromuscular education; and e ngage in physical activity consistent with na tional guidelines. Strength of Recommendation: Strong Description: Evidence is based on two or more \"High\" strength studies with consistent findings for recommending for or against the intervention. A Strong recomme ndation means that the benefits of the recommended approach clear ly exceed the potential harm and/or that the quality of the supportin g evidence is high. Implications: Practitioners should follow a Strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present. RATIONALE This recommendation is rated strong because of seven high- strength studies of which five showed beneficial outcomes. The exercise interventions were predominantly conducted under supervision, most often by a physical therapist. The self -management interventions were led by various healthcare providers including rheumatologists, nurses, ph ysical and occupational therapists, and health educators. T he evidence supports the use of self-management prog rams in primary care patients with kne e osteoarthritis. One of the stu dies used an existing evidenc e-based program, the A rthritis Self-Mana gement P rogram which was modified to i nclude an exercise compon ent. 20 In a high-strength study by Colem an et al. ,21 patients in a 6-week s elf- management import ant improve ments in W OMAC Pain, Stiffness, Function, a nd Total scores at eight w eeks as compa red to w ait-listed c ontrol s. The program in that s tudy was based on the same theoretical framework as the A SMP, but include d content that was spe cifically tailored to patients with knee osteoarthritis . Studi es in this review reported improvements in 29 of 37 outcom es favoring str ength training over a control (usua l care, education, or no tr eatment). Statistically significant and clinically important improve ments were reported for V AS P ain, W OMAC Pain, and WOMAC Function scores. In addition, 7 of 23 outcomes indicated statistically significant improvements with strengthening exercises, when performed as part of a physical therapy treatment program, versus control. 22-24 Three of the seven outcom es were clinically significant and one was possibl y clinically significant . One study reported statis tically significant and poss ibly clinically significant improv ement in W OMAC Tot al score following a combination of knee exercise and manu al physical therapy as compa red to s ubthe rapeutic ultrasound (control ).25 31 Studies also a ddressed t he type and setting for strength training. Long-term outcom es did not va ry among iso metric, isoton ic, or isokinetic e xercises.26 Both w eight-bearing and non weight-bearing exercises were superior to cont rol in improving physical function, how ever, the results were confli cting wh en the exercises were c ompa red to each other .27 High-resistance strength training led to si gnificantly faster w alk times on spong y surfaces as comp ared to l ow-resistance training28. Ebnezar e t al.29-31 compared a combination of yoga and ph ysical therapy to ph ysical therapy alone. All eight outcomes were statis tically and clinically significant favoring the combi ned treatment group measured by WOMAC Function and the SF-36 Physical Function and Bodily Pain subscales . Aqua tic therapy was also deem ed a suitable alternative to l and-based strengtheni ng exercises.32 Of the three stud ies ated e xercise in t he home settin g, the highest strength study favored hom e exercise versus no e xercise in reducing patients' global pa in rating; however, this finding did not meet the minimum clinically important improvement threshold.33 Three studies the e ffects of aerobic walking versus h ealth education and one compared it to usua l care in adults with osteoarthritis of the kn ee. There were statistically significant impro vements with a erobic exercise in all but one of the p erformance-based functional tasks as compared to t he education group. In the study by Kovar et al.,34 favorable outcomes were reported by the supe rvised walking group rather than usu al care with statis tically significant improvements in 6-minute wa lking distance and the Arthritis Impact Measurement Scale ( AIMS) Physical A ctivity and Pain subscales . For neuromus cular education, three of four statis favoring combined kine ength training exercises versus str ength training alone. A hi gh-strength study by Fitzgerald et al. 35 applied an effective treatment for anterior cruciate ligament in jury to patients w ith osteoarthritis of the kne e; they found that standa rd exercise combi ned with a gility and perturbation the rapy was not more effective than stand ard exercise therapy alone. Five of five o utcomes were statis tically significant for p roprioception training. Lin et a l.36 random ized 108 pa to non weight-bearing p roprio ception training, nonweight-beari ng strength training, and non tr eatment groups. Both pr opriocept ion and str ength training were significantly more effective in improving WOMAC Pain and F unction scores than no treatment. A number of fitness -related organizations have disseminated guidelines for physical activity. They generally emphasize the importance of aerobic conditioning and muscle - and bone - strengthening, regular activity, and balance exercises for older adults. In 2008, the federal government for the first time published national guidelines. Here is the link to the US Department of Health and Human Service's physical activity guidelines: http://www.health.gov/paguidelines/guidelines/default.aspx . SUPPORTING EVIDENCE QUALITY Relevant Tables: Table 7 Table 22- Table 38 32 There were nine studies that compared strength training to a control group. Seven of the studies wer e moderate quality and the remaining two were of low and high quality . Studies by Topp et al.37 , Huang et al.26, Jan et al28. and Bennell et al.38 were flawed in the blinding and investigator bias domains. The Shakoor et al.39 study had investigator bias, but was sufficiently blinded. Topp et al. ,37 Maurer et al. ,40 Azad et al.41 and Shakoor et al.39 were flawed in group assignment and group comparability. The Jan et al.28study was flawed in the group comparability domain. The Lin et al.36 study was of high quality and was only flawed by lack of patient blinding . Huang et al.26 compared isokinetic, isotonic, and isometric strength training. All of the outcomes were of moderate quality. The study was flawed in the blinding and investigator bias domains. Ettinger et al.42 compared aerobic exercise and strength training to education programs. Their moderate quality study had uncertain group comparability, as well as flaws in the group assignment and blinding domains. Lin et al.36 compared proprioceptive training and str ength training to no exercise measuring five outcomes. Their high quality study was only flaw ed by lack of patient blinding . Three studies of low, moderate and high quality compared physical therapy to control on six outcomes. Fransen et al .22 (moderate quality) and Borjesson et al.21 (low quality) were flawed in group assignment, blinding, and investigator bias. The study by Borjesson et al. was also flawed in group comparability. The high quality Bennell et al.23 study was not flawed in any domain. Deyle et al.25 compared combined exercise and physical therapy to placebo (non therapeutic intensity ultrasound) and was flawed in the group assignment, treatment integrity, and investigator bias domains Diracoglu et al.43 compared kinesthes ia plus strength training to a control group that received only strength training. All five outcomes that they evaluated were of moderate quality. There were flaws in the group assignment and investigator bias domains. Teixeira et al. 44 and Fitzgerald et al.35 compared combined agility and perturbation exercise to standard exercise therapy. Teixeira et al.44 conducted a low quality retrospective study that was flawed in the hypothesis, group assignm ent and blinding domains. The Fitzgerald et al. study was of high quality; its only flaw was investigator bias. Yip et al.45 studied the efficacy of self -management programs combined with an exercise component . Their moderate quality study was flawed in the group comparability, group assignment, and investigator bias domains. Kovar et al.34 compared a supervised w alking program to usual care; their study was flawed in the same three domains. Three studies compared aerobic exercise to education. Two studies were assigned low quality ratings. The study by Ettinger et al.42 was of moderate quality and has been described in a previous paragraph. Focht et al.46 did not establish a prospective hypothesis 33 and was flawed in the group assignment, blinding, and inves tigator bias domains . The study by Rejeski et al.47 (also of low qualit y) was determined to have the same flaws. Home -based exercise programs were evaluated in two high33;48 and one moderate49 quality studies. One high quality study33 compared a home -based exercise program to a group that received no intervention. Its only flaw was that evaluators were not blinded to treatme nt allocation. The other high48 and the one moderate49 quality s tudies compared hospital -based to home -based exercise programs. Group assignment and group comparability were flawed in the modera te quality study. Potential investigator bias was the only flaw in the high quality study. A study by Jan et al.27 of moderate quality compared weight bearing to nonweight - bearing exercise. Although it was sufficiently blinded, was free of investigator bias, used valid measurements, and had treatment integrity, the group assignment and group comparability domains were flawed. Six outcomes were inclu ded from a study by Silva et al.32 that compared water and land - based exercise treatments. The study was flawed in the group assignment and investigator bias domains , producing a moderate quality rating. The stud y by Coleman et al.21 compared a self-management education program to waitlist control. There were no flaws in the quality domains. Allen et al.50 compared telephone based self -management to attention control and usual care . In the comparison to attention control, there was uncertain group comparability at baseline and lack of allocation concealment. In the comparison to usual care, the same limitations occurred and the blinding domain was also flawed. Hurley et al.51 studied the effect of an integrated exercise, sel f-management and coping strategies education program in comparison to usual care. This moderate quality study was flawed in the group assignment, group comparability and treatment integrity domains . Three studies compared yoga plus physiotherapy to a control group that received physiotherapy only. One study by Ebnezar et al. 29 was of high quality, and the other two by Ebnezar et al.30,31 were low quality studies. The only flaw in the high quality study was possible investigator bias. The t wo low quality studies were retro spective and were flawed in the blinding, group assignment and group comparability domains . Ravaud et al. 52 compared a standardized structured physician consultation program to usual care. Their moderate quality study was flawed in the treatment integrity and investigator bias domains. APPLICABILITY Relevant Tables: Table 7 Table 22 -Table 38 34 In all the included studies except the one by Bennell et al.38 there was uncertainty if the treatment administratio n and those who delivered them represented typical clinical practice. In 2 7 out of 34 studies, participants may not have been representative of the general patient population. In all but six studies, patient compliance and adherence to the treatment regimens were representative. Thirty out of 34 studies included a sufficient percentage of enrolled pa tients in the final analysis. FINAL STRENGTH OF EV IDENCE Every included study was of moderate applicability. The strength of evidence ratings remained unchanged from the quality ratings for all outcomes. Table 7.

Tw enty-nine out of 37 outcomes were s tatistically significant in favor of strength training. There were three critical outcomes: VAS Pain , WOMAC Pain and WOMAC Function. A total of ten measurements comprised these outcomes and eight showed sta tistically significant benefits from strength training. Four of the statistically significant critical outcomes were clinically significant, and three were possibly clinically significant. For VAS Pain , two out of four outcom es were clinically significant showing benefit in strength training. The other two outcomes were possibly clinically significant. Three out of five WOMAC Pain outcomes were statistically significant in favor of stre ngth training. One was cl inically significant and another was possibly clinically significant. Clinical importance was unknown for the significant WOMAC Pain outcome in the Topp et al. study because the article did not provide sufficient data to determine it. Also, one WOMAC Function outcome was clinically significant. A meta -analysis of four studies was computed comparing strength training to cont rol groups in pain outcome . Three of the studies used the visual analogue versions of the WOMAC Pain subscale, and the fourth used the VAS p ain scale. The treatment group reported significantly less pain than the control group (see Figure 1 2 ). Clinical significance could not be determined since nonidentical pain measures were used in the meta -analysis. One strength training study investigated treatment effect on WOMAC Function at eight weeks. This study found a clinically significant improvement reported by the strength training group. VAS p ain was evaluated in a study that compared isokinetic, isotonic and isometric strength training. At eight weeks there was a possibly clinically significant treatment effect suggesting isometric strength training was superior to isotonic training. However, at 52 weeks, patients in the isotonic group had lower VAS p ain scores than isomet ric patients although the effect was not clinically significant. VAS p ain was significantly lower in the isotonic group than the isokinetic group at week eight, but this difference was not st atistically significant at the 52 nd week . Isokinetic was signifi cantly more effective at 8 and 52 weeks than isometric strength training although the effect was not clinically significant. Jan et al.28examined the effect of high versus low resistance strength training and found that the high resistance strength training group had a significantly faster spongy surface walk time. The treatmen t effect was not statistically significant for the timed stair climb or level ground and figure -8 walk times. 46 Seven out of 23 outcomes showed statistically significant improvement from physical therapy over the control group. Seven of 18 critical outcome s significantly favored physical therapy. Of the seven significant outcomes, three were clinically significant and one was possibly clinically significant. Functional performance tasks, such as number of steps walked per second, stride length, and m eters w alked per minute were not statisticall y significant. Additionally, all three outcomes in the study by Deyle et al. 25 were statistically significant endorsing combined manual physical therap y and exerci se over the placebo treatment. Finally, only the timed walk outcome out of seven measures was statistically significant in comparisons of home and center based physiotherapy. Coleman et al.21 compared a class-based self-managemen t program to wait list control. Fourteen of 24 outcomes were statistically significant in favor of the treatment group. Pain and function were the critical outcomes. Te n out of 18 functional outcomes and one out of two pain outcomes were significantly impro ved i n the self -management group compared to the control group. Allen et al.50compared a telephone -based self -management program to an attention control group and usual care. The treatment group received written and audio osteoarth ritis self -management materials as well as monthly phone calls from a health educator. The health educator discussed self -management strategies and helped the patient develop goal -oriented action plans. The attention control group received general health education materials and phone calls that were not specifically related to osteoarthritis. Compared to the attention control gr oup, osteoarthritis self-management patients reported significantly better VAS pain, AIMS -2 pain, AIMS -2 walking and bending and Arthritis Self -Efficacy scale scores. AIMS -2 function, mobility, and affect scores did not differ statistically . VAS pain score s were lower for patients in the osteoarthritis telephone self -management group than for those who received usual care. However, the AIMS -2 subscales and Arthritis Self -Efficacy scores were not statistically improved over usual care. One study 27 compared weight bearing and non -weight bearing exercise to a control group using self reported function and functional performance outcomes. Both exercise treatment groups were associated with significantly better scores than the control group. The result s comparing weight bearing and non -weigh t bearing exercise were inconsistent. Patients in the non- weight bearing group were able to climb stairs significantly faster than those in the weight bearing group. However, the weight bearing group produced significantly faster walk times on a spongy surface. All other outcomes did not show statistically significant differences between the two groups. Three out of four outcomes were statistically significant for combined kinesthesia, balance, and strength training compared to strength training alone in the control group. Two out of three self reported functional outcomes were higher for the treatment group. Ten meter walk times were significantly faster in the kinesthesia plus balance group. Exercise combined with agility and perturbation therapy was not found to be significantly more effective than exercise therapy alone. Out of 22 outcomes in the Fitzgerald et al. and T eixeira et al. studies , only one was stati stically significant for the treatment group. 47 There was one s elf reported functional outcome examining the effect of aerobic exercise. Rejeski et al. reported that the exercise group did not have significantly better SF -36 Mental Health scores. Ho wever, the aerobic exercise group performed better o n all functional tasks except timed stair climb. Kovar et al.34 compared a supervised walking program and education to routine care. AIMS Pain and physical activity were significantly better in the walking group than in the control group. AIMS -arthritis impact was not statistically significant, but six minute walking distances were significantly longer for patients in the treatment group. O'Reilly et al.33compared the effect of a home -based exercise pr ogram to no intervention. VAS overall pain, VAS p ain on walking, VAS p ain climbing stairs, and WOMAC function were all statistically significant in favor of the treatment. The improvement in WOMAC f unction was possibly clinically important. However, the lower confidence limit of each VAS measure was lower than the MCII, meaning home -based exercise did not result in a clinically significant improvement in self reported pain r elative to the control group. The study also measured the treatment effects using each subscale of the SF-36 (we excluded SF-36 physical function and bodily pain because they were not sufficiently powered). Each subscale was not significantly different between the treatment and control groups. McCarthy et al.48and Tunay et al.49compared home -based and classroom format exercise programs. The former fou nd that supplementing home -based programs with in- class ones resulted in significant improvements in pain and stiffness for patients compared to those who participated in home -based exercise only. The Tunay et al. study, however, did not find hospital -based proprioception and strengthening programs to be more effective than those conducted at home; except when they measured VAS activity score of the left knee. One study compared the efficacy of water -based exercise programs to land -based programs. The tre atment effect for VAS p ain before and after walking was not statistically significant at nine weeks, but was significant at 18 weeks. However, the effect was not clinically important. Overall VAS p ain and Lequesne index scores were not significantly differ ent for water - and land - based exercise programs. Yip et al.45 compared self -management plus exercise to usual care. Both pain outcomes were significantly lower in the treatment group. However, the difference in VAS p ain was not clinically impor tant. There was not a statistically significant difference in Health Assessment Questionnaire scores, but the treatment group reported significantly higher Arthritis Self -Efficacy Other Symptoms Scores, and spent a greater number of hours exercising per we ek. Figure 8 contains the summary of results for the effect of a standardized structured physician consultation program that focused on educating the patient in osteoarthritis treatment, exercises, and weight loss. Three critical outcomes are presented: SF -12 Mental function, SF -12 Physical Function and WOMAC Function. While the effect of education on mental function was clinically significant, the other two critical outcomes were not statistically significant. 48 Hurley et al.51 studied found that a program integrating exercise with self -management and coping strategies education resulted in statistically significant improvements over the control group in seven out of ten outcomes. The treatment effects for WOMAC Pain function and total scores were possibly clinically important. Ebnezar et al.29-31 compared a group undergoing yoga and physiotherapy to a control group that only received physiotherapy. All eight outcomes were significantly higher in the treatment group. The treatment effects for WOMAC function, SF -36 physical function and pain were clinically significant. 49 Figure 2.

Strength of Recommendation: Moderate Description: Evidence from two or more \"Moderate\" strength studies with consistent findings, or evidence from a single \"High\" quality study for recommending for or against the intervention. A Moderate recommendation means that the benefits exceed the potential harm (or that the potential harm clearly exceeds the benefits in the case of a negative recommendation), but the quality/applicability of the supporting evidence is not as strong. Implications: Practitioners should generally follow a Moderate recommendation but remain alert to new information and be sensitive to patient preferences. RATIONALE There was one moderat e- and two low - strength studies included in this recommendation. Physical Function on the SF -36 showed minimum clinically important improvement in outcomes for this patient population. WOMAC function also showed statistical improvement which was possibly clinically significant. Diet and exercise combined revealed improved results. The workgroup considers that the public and patient health benefits of weight loss warranted an upgrade of the recommendation strength to moderate. 53-55 SUPPORTING EVIDENCE QUALITY Relevant Tables: Table 6 8-Table 70, Table 71- Table 74 Two low quality studies46;47 compared exercise- based weight loss to health education. Neither had treatment integrity , group comparability or measurement flaws . However, they were flawed in their hypotheses were retrospective. Additi onally , they were flawed in the group assignment, blinding , and investigator bias domains. Focht et al.46 was the only aerobic exercise study that was sufficiently blinded. There were three included studies that compared weight loss programs (diet and/or exercise) to health education controls. Two studies were of low quality46;47, and the other was of moderate quality56 The treatment integr ity, group comparability and measurement domains were not fl awed. T he group assignment and investigator bias domains were. Rejeski et al.47and Focht et al.46 were retrospective and therefore flawed in the hypothesis domain. Miller et al.56was the only study that was sufficiently blinded. Three studies compared very l ow energy diets to conventional low energy diets. Bliddal et al.57 and Riecke et al.58 were low quality, and Christensen et al.59 was of moderate quality. The studies were not flawed in terms of treatment integ rity and measurement, but flawed in the group assignment, group comparability and investigator bias domains. Additionally, Reicke et al. and Bliddal et al. did not contain prospective hypotheses and were flawed in the blinding domain. 138 Two included studies compared diet to exercise. Jenkinson et al.60 was a high quality study that was appropriate in every quality domain except for investigator bias. The other study46 was not flawed in the treatment integrity and measurement domains. However, it was flawed in the hypothesis, group assignment, blinding, group comparability, and investigator bias domains and was given a low quality rating. APPLICABILITY Relevant Tables : Table 68 -Table 70 , Table 71 -Table 74 The participants and the administration of the interventions may not have been representative of clinical pra ctice in the included exercise- based weight loss studies 46;47 Compliance and adherence were similar in bot h studies. I ntent to treat analysis was used in both studies . The three studies that compared weight loss to education likewise contained uncertainty as to whether the participants and the treatment interventions reflected typical clinical practice 46;47;56 Compliance and adherence were not rep resentative in the Miller et al. study. The studies included all enrolled patients in their final analysis. Compliance and adheren ce were representative of clinical practice in the studies that compared low energy diets to conventional diets. However, it was unclear if the treatment intervention was rep resentative. Christensen et al.59 enrolled participants that might not have been representative of clinical practice, and did not include all enrolled patients in the final analysis. The diet versus exercise studies had a non -representative application of the treatmen t intervent ion, and Focht et al. 46 included patients that might not have been similar to those seen in clinical p ractice. Compliance and adherence were representative of clinical practice in one of the studies, and both included all enrolled patients in their final analyses. FINAL STRENGTH OF EV IDENCE All studies in this recommendation were rated as having moderate applicability. Therefor e, low quality studies were rated as low strength of evidence, and moderate quality studies were rated as moderate strength. Table 68.

When SF -36 Mental Health and timed stair climb scores were compared to a healthy lifestyle education control group, there were no statistically significant differences. Figure 1 3 contains a summary of results for studies comparing weight loss programs to health education controls. The weight loss programs consisted of dietary interventions alone, or a combination of exercise and diet. Six out of 11 outcomes were statistically significant in favor of the weight loss intervention. Pain and function were the critical outcomes for this recommendation. Three of five self -reported functional outcomes were statistically significant in favor of weight loss; two of which were clinically important, 141 and one possibly clinically significant. The pain outcome was clinically significant in favor of the weight loss intervention. Three out of 15 outcomes were statistically significant in favor of low energy versus conventional diets. WOMAC t otal was significantly improved in the low energy diet group, and two out of seven functional outcomes were hig her. There were no significant differences in the pain or quality of life outcomes ( Figure 1 4 ). There were two studies that compared diet to exercise. Focht et al46 found that 6- minute walk distances were significantly longer in the exercise group than in the diet group. Furthermore, p articipants who rec eived exercise and diet walked significantly l engthier distances than those treated with a diet intervention alone, but there was no significant difference compared to patients in the exercise -only group. Jenkinson et al. 60 found that the proportion of patients who achieved a 30% reduction in WOMAC p ain did not differ significantly in the exercise group compared to the group receiving diet treatments. 142 Figure 13.

Strength of Recommendation: Strong Description: Evidence is based on two or more \"High\" strength studies with consistent findings for recommending for or against the intervention. A Strong recomme ndation means that the quality of the supporti ng evidence is high. A harms analysis on this recommendation was not performed Implications: Practitioners should follow a Strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present. RECOMMENDATION 3B We are unable to recommend for or against the use of physical agents (including electrotherapeutic modalities) in patients with symptomatic osteoarthritis of the knee. Strength of Recommendation: Inconclusive Description: Evidence from a single low quality study or conflicting findings that do not allow a recommendation for or against the intervention. An Inconclusive recommendation means that there is a lack of compelling evidence that ha s resulted in an unclear balance between benefits and potential harm. Implications: Practitioners should feel little constraint in following a recommendation labeled as Inconclusive, exercise clinical judgment, and be alert for emerging evidence that clar ifies or helps to determine the balance between benefits and potential harm. Patient preference should have a substantial influencing role. RECOMMENDATION 3C We are unable to recomm end for or against manual therapy in patients with symptomatic osteoarthritis of the knee. Strength of Recommendation: Inconclusive Description: Evidence from a single low quality study or conflicting findings that do not allow a recommendation for or against the intervention. An Inconclusive recommendation means that there is a lack of compelling evidence that has resulted in an unclear balance between benefits and potential harm. Implications: Practitioners should feel little constraint in following a recommendation labeled as Inconclusive, exercise clinical judgment, and be alert for emerging evidence that clarifies or helps to determine the balance between benefits and potential harm. Patient preference should have a substantial influencing role. RATIONALE Variable st rengths of e vidence were reported in studies of pa tients with osteo arthritis of the knee. 3A There were five hi gh- and five mode rate- strength studi es that comp ared rison groups receiving non-intervention sham, usua l care, or education. The five moderate- strength studies were included because they reported outcomes that were different than the high -strength evidence. High-strength studi es include d: Berman et al, 61 159 Suarez-Alma zor et al. ,62 Weiner et al. ,63 Williamson et al.64 and T aechaarpornkul et a l.65 Mode rate-strength studi included: al. ,66 Vas et al.,67 Witt et al.68 and Berman et al .69 The majority of studies were not statistically significant and an even larger proportion of the evidence was not clinically significant. Some outcomes were associated with clinical- but not statistical- significance. The strength of this recommendatio n was based on lack of efficacy, not on potential harm. 3B The evidence was mixed regarding the efficacy of physical agents and electrotherapeutic modalities because of contradiction in findings, design flaws, or a low count of like studies. A s ingle low-strength 70 and a single-moderate stre ngth t o pla cebo produced contradicto ry results. See the results of the Fary et al.70 and Zizic et al.71 articles in table 96. T rock et a l.72 conducted a moderate - strength study evaluating pulsed electromagnetic stimulation and found that it did not generate a statistically significant eff ect on pain during passive motion, but that tenderness and physician's overall assessment scores were superior in the experimental group. Atamaz et al. 73 conducted a moderate- strength study that compared transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), sh ortwave diathermy, and interferential current to a sham procedure. None of the treatments were associated with statistically significant effects on pain, physical mobility, or ambulation time at four, 12, or 26 weeks. Battisti et al., 74 also in a moderate- strength study, found that therapeutic application of modulated electromagnetic field therapy (TAMMEF) did not produce statistically significant improvements in pain or Lequesne Index scores, compared to extremely low -frequency electrom agnetic field therapy. However, there was evidence that ultrasound was effective in patients with knee osteoarthritis. Huang et al. 75 and Yang et al.76 conducted moderate -strength studies that compared ultrasound to a cont rol group. Huang et al. found that patients who received isotonic exercise with ultrasound had significantly superior ambulation speed, Lequesne Index scores, and VAS pain scores. Yang et al. found VAS pain and Lequesne Index scores were significantly superior at 4 weeks in patients who received ultrasound over those who received a sham treatment. Due to the overall inconsistent findings for various physical agents and electrotherapeutic modalities, we were unable to make a recommendation for or against their use in patients with symptomatic osteoarthritis of the knee. 3C We were unable to recommend for or against manual therapy due to the lack of studies examining most manual therapy techniques. No studies evaluating joint mobilization, joint manipulation, chiropractic therapy, patellar mobilization, or myofascial release were found that met our inclusion criteria. P erlman et al. 77 examined Swedish m assage therapy using a low-strength study design. The findings showed statistically significant results at 8 weeks, but not at 16 weeks. A conclusive recommendation regarding Swedish massage therapy could not be made based on this single l ow strength of evidence study. 160 SUPPORTING EVIDENCE QUALITY Relevant Tables: Table 80- Table 8 5, Table 8 6-Table 91 There were five high quality studies, and four moderate quality studies that compared acupuncture to a control group (sham, usual care, or education). None of the studies were flawed in the hypothesis, treatment integrity, and measurement domains. Five of nine studies we re flawed in the group assignment domain. S even and six of nine articles were appropriate in the blinding and group comparability domains. Vas et al. ,67 Witt et al.,68 and Taechaarpornkul et al.65 had investigator bias. One high quality study, Wiener et al. ,63 compared periosteal stimulation therapy to regular acupuncture and was unflawed in every quality domain except for group assignment. Pulsed electrical stimulation was compared to placebo by Fary et al. 70 This study was of low quality with flaws in the hypothesis, blinding, group assignment and group comparability domains. Pulsed electromagnetic therapy was compared to placebo in studies by Trock et al.72 and Zizic et al.71 The former was of moderate quality with flaws in the group assignment, comparability and investigator bias domains. Quality of the latter was affected by uncertain group comparability as well as investigator bias. Battisti et al.74 compared Therapeutic Application of Modulated Electro Magnetic Field (TAMMEF) treatments to extremely low frequency elect romagnetic field therapy. Since there was uncertainty concerning group assignment and group comparability, this study was given a rating of moderate quality. Atamaz et al.73 compared transcutaneou s electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), interferential currents, and short wave diathermy to a sham control group. Since group comparability at baseline was uncertain and the treatment integrity domain was flawed, the study was of moderate quality. One study77 compared Swedish massage therapy to usual care. This low quality study was flawed in the group assignment, blinding, group com parability and treatment integrity domains. Where it was not flawed was in the hypothesis, measurement and investigator bias domains. Huang et al. ,75 a moderate quality study , compared ultrasonic wave therapy in combination with exercise to an exercise intervention alone. The study was flawed in the binding and investigator bias domains and not flawed in the hypothesis, group assignment, group comparability, treatment integrity and measurement domains. Yang et al. 76 compared ultrasound therapy to placebo. This moderate quality study was only flawed in the group assignment and group comparability domains. 161 APPLICABILITY Relevant Tables: Table 80- Table 85, Table 86 -Table 91 In all nine included acupuncture studies, the treatments might not have been administered in a manner representative of clinical practice. Similarly, it was not clear if the study participants were similar to the typical patient population in all but one of the studies. Compliance was similar in all included acupuncture studies. Nine out of 10 studies based their final analyses on all enrolled patients. The studies were of moderate applicabilit y. Participants, treatment administration , and compliance in the Swedish massage therapy study might not have been similar to that typically found in clinical practice. However, the study included all enrolled patients in the final analysis. It was rated as having moderate applicability. It was not certain if participants and the treatment administration were representative of typical clinical practice for the ultrasound,75;76 pulsed electrical stimulation and pulsed electromagnetic therapy studie s.70-72 The study by Battisti et al.74 of TAMMEF was flawed in the representativeness of treatment administration. Compliance followed a similar pattern to clinical practice for these studies. Also, with the exception of the Zizic et al. 71 study, all enrolled patients we re included in the final analyses. The applicability ratings were determined to be moderate. The Atamaz et al.73 study examining treatment efficacy of TENS, interferential currents, and short wave diathermy included a sufficient percentage of enrolled patients in the final analysis. However, the treatment administration, patients who received the interventions , and the monitoring of compliance and adherence in the study were not representative of regular clinical practice. FINAL STRENGTH OF EV IDENCE All strength of evidence ratings were the same as the quality ratings since all studies were rated as having moderate app licability. Table 80.

Twelve were statistically significant in favor of acupuncture (see Figure 1 6 for a summary of the results). The critical outcomes reported by the acupuncture studies were pain, function and quality of life. Meta -analyses were run for WOMAC p ain and function at four to five weeks, six to eight weeks, and 12 to 14 weeks and are described in Figures 19 and 20. For each outcome, subgroups of studies were combined when their follow -up durations were similar. There were 1 3 included pain outcomes, three of which were statistically significant over placebo. The meta- analysis results showed that ac upunctur e had a statistically non - significant (and not clinically important) effect on pain at four to five weeks and at six to eight weeks (Figure 16 ). The acupuncture effect was not statistically significant at 12 to 14 weeks , but the confidence interval did include the MCII (making the 12 to 14 week effect inconclusive). Three out of 31 functional outcomes were statistically significant in favor of acupuncture over sham/ placebo. The meta-analysis results ( Figure 2 4) indicated that the WOMAC Function scores were significantly superior to sham at six to eight weeks and at 12 to 14 weeks . However, none of the statistically significant out comes were clinically important. Vas et al.67 addressed the effect of acupuncture on quality of life with the five subsections of the Profile of Quality of Life in the Chronically Ill (PQLC). These subsections included negative mood, physical capability, psychological function, social function and social well being. No outcome achieved statistical significance. One study compared periosteal stimulation therapy (PST) to regular acupuncture. 59 There were a total of seven outcomes studi ed. Only WOMAC pain at six we eks (the only critical outcome) was statistically significant in favor of PST ( Table 97 ). Fary et al. ,70 Trock et al.72 and Zizic et al.71 compared the effectiveness of pulsed electrical stimulation to placebo. Five out of 16 outcomes were statistically significant in favor of the treatment ( Figure 19 ). The critical outcomes addressed were activities of daily life (ADL), self -reported function, and pain. All of the ADL outcomes were not statistically significant when compared to placebo. One out of two functional outcomes, and one out of two pain outcomes were statistically significant in favor of pulsed electrical stimulation over placebo. 170 Trock et al.72 compared the effect of pulsed el ectromagnetic fields to placebo. Pain on passive motion was not statistically different between groups. However, tenderness and Physician's Global A ssessment were significantly improved in the treatment group. One additional study compared therapeutic application of modulated electro- magnetic field (TAMMEF) therapy to extremely low frequency electromagnetic field therapy .74 There were no significant differences in pain and Lequesne index scores between the two treatments. Pearlman et al.77 compared Swedish massage therapy to a wait list control at eight and 16 weeks based on twelve outcomes ( table 99 ). The treatment group had significantly better scores on all outcomes at eight weeks. At 16 weeks, every outcome was not significantly different when comparing the treatment arms. However, five outcomes were not sufficiently powered. VAS pain, WOMAC p ain and WOMAC f unction were the critical outcomes included in this study. Massage therapy had a possibly clinica lly important effect on VAS p ain and WOMAC function scores at eight weeks. Swedish Massage Therapy had a clinically significant effect on WOMAC pain scores at eight weeks. Huang et al.75 and Yang et al.76 compared ultrasound therapy to a control group. One study compared ultrasound to placebo, and the other compared isotonic exercise plus ultrasound to a control group who only received exercise therapy. Seven out of eight outcomes were statistic ally significant in favor of ultrasound (see Figure 1 8 ). VAS p ain was the only critical outcome in cluded in these studies. Two of three pain outcomes were statistically significant in favor of the ultrasound group ( Figure 1 8). Atamaz et al.73 compared TENS, interferential current therapy (IFC), and short wave diathermy (SWD) to sham treatments (sham TENS, sham IFC, sham SWD). There were no statistically significant differences be tween any active treatments and their sham counterparts. 171 Figure 16.

Strength of Recommendation: Inconclusive Description: Evidence from a single low quality study or conflicting findings that do not allow a recommendation for or against the in tervention. An Inconclusive recommendation means that there is a lack of compelling evidence that has resulted in an unclear balance between benefits and potential harm. Implications: Practitioners should feel little constraint in following a recommendation labeled as Inconclusive, exercise clinical judgment, and be alert for emerging evidence that clarifies or helps to determine the balance between benefits and potential harm. Patient preference should have a substantial influencing role. RATIONALE This recommendation is based on three separate studies; one high- strength study78 compared a valgus producing brace plus usual care to a neoprene sleeve brace plus usual care and to usua l care alone. A second high- strength study compared a valgus directing force brace to a lateral wedge foot orthotic.79 The third study of moderate -strength compared a valgus directing force brace plus usual ca re to usual care alone.80 Therapies were compared with res pect to how much they improved pain, stiffness, self -reported functional capacity, and physical performance measures (observed walking distance and number of stairs climbed in 30 seconds). Improvement using the varus producing brace was not consistently si gnificant across the four studies. For all statistically significant comparisons, the clinical significance of the improvements in pain and physical function were unclear. Based on a lack of appropriate studies, the use of a varus directing force brace wa s not evaluated. SUPPORTING EVIDENCE QUALITY Relevant Tables: Table 102-Table 104, Table 10 5-Table 10 7 There were two high -78;79 and one moderate -80quality randomized controlled trials that comprise d the evidence for t his recommendation. Two studies compared braces plus usual care to usual care alone.78;80 One RCT compared bracing to insoles. 79 One of the three studies had a potential for investigator bias. No other quality domains were flawed in any of the included studies. APPLICABILITY Relevant Tables: Table 102- Table 104, Ta ble 105- Table 107 In all three included studies, there was uncertainty whether the treatment administration and the study participants were representative of clini cal practice. The Kirkley et al.78 study was the only study that did not use all enrolled patients in their final analysis. Also, 228 the Van Raaij et al.79 study was the only one with compliance and adherence measures that were not similar to regular practice. FINAL STRENGTH OF EV IDENCE All studies had high quality and moderate applicability that resulted in in high strength of evidence ratings. Table 102.

Quality and Applicability Summary : Brace Versus Insoles Study Outcome Duration Quality Applicability Strength of Evidence Van Raaij VAS Pain 6 months High Moderate High RESULTS Relevant Tables: Figure 2 5-Figure 2 6, Table 108- Table 1 13 230 Two out of the three studies compared braces combined with usual care to usual care alone. Brouwer et al.80 included a patient population with Ahlback grades of 1- 2. Kirkley et al.78 included patients with Kellgren and Lawrence g rades of 1 -4. In the Brouwer et al. study usual care consisted of education, analgesics (as needed) and physical therapy (as needed). In the Kirkley et al. study, usual care consisted of an educational pamphlet and as needed acetaminophen . Participants who were already taking NSAIDs before the study were allowed to continue using them. There was inconclusive evidence regarding the efficacy of knee bracing. Kirkley et al. 78 found that patients in the brace group reported significantly better scores on the WOMAC subscales (p ain, function, stiffness, total), VAS p ain on waking, VAS p ain on climbing stairs, and the MACTAR tests than the group who received only acetamin ophen and an educational pamphlet. Kirkley et al. found nonsignificant differences for distance walked in 6 minutes, and number of stairs climbed in 30 seconds. Brouwer et al. 80 found statistically nonsignificant differences between the brace group and the usual care group (education, analgesic as needed, and ph ysical therapy as needed) at three, six and 12 months, in VAS pain , knee function and quality of life. Although, walking distance was found to be significantly greater in the treatment group than the control group at each follow up period. Kirkley et al. 78 also compared the unloader brace to the neoprene sleeve. For all pain outcomes, the brace was significantly mor e effective than the sleeve. However, there was no statistically significant difference between the two treatments for self reported functioning, functional tasks, WOMAC Stiffness or WOMAC Total ( Figure 2 6 ). Van Raaij et al.79 compared the effectiveness of bracing to foot insoles. The authors found that VAS p ain was significantly lessened in the brace group than the insole group. Figure 25.

Strength of Recommendation: Moderate Description: Evidence from two or more \"Moderate\" strength studies with consistent findings, or evidence from a single \"High\" quality study for recommending for or against the intervention. A Moderate recommendation means that the benefits exceed the potential harm (or that the potential harm clearly exceeds the benefits in the case of a negative recommendation), but the quality/applicability of the supporting evidence is not as strong. Implications: Practitioners should generally follow a Moderate recommendation but remain alert to new information and be sensitive to patient preferences. RATIONALE This recommendation is based on five studies. Four studies, one of high- strength81 and three of moderate -streng th, compared outcomes using lateral wedge insoles to neutral insoles.82-84 No significant chang es in pain, self -reported physical function, or Patient Global Assessment scores were seen between the two types of insoles. A fifth low - strength study compared urethane lateral wedge insoles to rubber lateral insoles, and found a statistically significant improvement in Lequesne score for urethane insoles, but this outcome was of uncertain clinical significance. 85 SUPPORTING EVIDENCE QUALITY Relevant Tables: Table 1 14-Table 1 15, Table 1 17 There were four studies that compared lateral wedge insoles to neutral insoles. Bennell et al.81 was of high strength ; Baker et al. , 82 Maillefert et al.83 and Pham et al.84 were moderate strength . Group assignment was not flawed in the Ba ker et al. and Bennell et al. studies81;82. The equality of treatment groups at baseline was acceptable in the Bennell et al.81 study. The treatment integrity was a problem in the studies by Maillefert et al.83 and Pham et al.84 due to the use of concomitant NSAIDs. There was potential for investigator bias in the Baker et al. and Bennell et al.81;82 studies. N o lateral wedge insole studies had probl ems with the validity of the outcomes measurements . Toda et al.85 compared Lequesne index scores of rubber to urethane insoles. This low strength study was flawed in the group assignment, comparability, investigator bias and blinding domains. APPLICABILITY Relevant Tables: Table 114- Table 115, Table 117 Moderate applicability ratings were given to all studies. The delivery of treatment interventions might not have been representative of clinical practice in the studies. In four out of five studies , participants might not h ave been representative of the osteoarthritis of the knee patient population. 81;83 -85 All enrolled patients were included in the final 249 analyses of each study . Compliance and adhe rence were typical of clinical practice in the studies by Toda et al . and Bennell et al. 81;85 FINAL STRENGTH OF EV IDENCE The moderate quality and m oderate applicability ratings were the reasons four out of five studies were rated as moderate strength of evidence. One of the fo ur studies had moderate quality but low applicability and received a low strength of evidence rating. Table 114.

Strength of Recommendation: Strong Description: Evidence is based on two or more \"High\" strength studies with consistent findings for recommending for or against the intervention. A Strong recommendation means that the quality of the supporting evidence is high. A harms analysis on this recommendation was not performed. Implications: Practitioners should follow a Strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present. RATIONALE Twenty -one studies were included as evidence for this recommendation; all were prospective. Twelve focused on glucosamine alone, eight on chondroitin sulfate alone, and one (Clegg et. al86) assessed both. Sixteen were of moderate -strength and five were of high -strength. Among the studies, eleven of 52 outcomes were statistically significant in favor of glucosamine when compared to placebo. WOMAC pain and function subscales scores and VAS pain were the critical outcomes and were not associated with statis tical significance at any treatment duration period. When meta -analyses were run for WOMAC pain, function, stiffness and total subscale scores, all meta -analyses showed that the overall effect of glucosamine compared to placebo was not statistically signif icant. Two studies compared glucosamine to active treatments. Glucosamine was compared to reparagen 87 (a poly -herbal suppl ement), and enzymatic hydrolyzed collagen.88 Glucosamine was found to have no significant effect on pain compared to these treatments. Figure 3 3 presents the meta- analysis results comparing chondroitin sulfate to placebo in pain scores on the VAS. The weighted mean difference revealed that scores were 11.89 points lower in the chondroitin group than in the placebo group. However, the difference was not clinically important. At this time, both glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate have been extensively studied. Despite the availability of the literature, there is essentially no evidence that minimum clinically important outcomes have been achieved co mpared to placebo, whether evaluated alone or in combination. The strength of the recommendation is based on lack of efficacy, not on potential harm. One of our search terms was neutraceuticals and we initially maintained a broad focus. However, the origi nal guidance was to evaluate methylsulfonylmethane, omega- 3, gelatin, vitamin D, dimethylsulfoxide, antioxidants, and coenzyme Q10. The general term was intended to guide the search of the specific terms. Additionally, the evidence for neutraceuticals was variable and could not be easily summarized. Two moderate -strength 262 studies89;90comparing ginger extract to placebo arose in the included evidence. The only improvement in pain associated with both statistical significance and clinical importance was measured using WOMAC stiffness. Clinical importance could not be determined for four other pain measures, or they did not meet the minimum clinically important improvement threshold. The findings on outcomes of function were contradictory and low in count, which rendered them inconclusive. Glycosaminoglycan polysulfuric acid (GAGPS) 91 produced a true negative finding statistically and clinically, and gubitong was associated with highe r WOMAC total scores than glucosamine in a non- control matched study where clinical importance could not be determined. SUPPORTING EVIDENCE QUALITY Relevant Tables: Table 1 21-Table1 23 Twenty one studies were included as evidence for this recomm endation. Schnitzer et al. was the only study that was not prospective. Fifteen studies were flawed in the group assignment domain. The studies and outcomes were all blinded. Ten studies were flawed in group comparability. With the exception of studies by Cibere et al.92 and Mazierez et al.,93 treatment integrity was maintained . Three studies did not have investigator bias as a concern, and all studies used valid outcome measurement instruments. In all, there were five high quality studies, one low quality study and 15 moderate quality studies included in this recommendation. APPLICABILITY Relevant Tables: Table 121- Table123 Seventeen studies enrolled patients who might not ha ve been representative of the osteoarthritis of the knee population. Treatment administration was atypical of regular clinical practice in all studies and compliance and adherence were typical in 18 out of 21 studies. Finally, five studies did not include all enroll ed patients in the f inal analyses. FINAL STRENGTH OF EV IDENCE All strength of evidence ratings were the same as the quality ratings since every outcome was of moderate applicability. 263 Table 121.

g lucosamine when compared to placebo (see Figure 31 ). WOMAC pain , WOMAC f unction, and VAS pain were the critical outcomes. No ne were associated with statistical significance at any time duration ( Figure 31 ). Meta- analyses were run for WOMAC pain, WOMAC stiffness and WOMAC t otal. All meta -analyses showed statistically ins ignificant differences between glucosamine and placebo ( Figures 3 8-41). Two studies compared glucosamine to active treatments. Glucosamine was compared to reparagen 87 and enzymatic hydrolyzed collagen (EHC).88 It was found to have no statistically significant effect on pain compared to reparagen . Enzymatic hydrolyzed collagen (EHC) was compared to glucosamine sulfate by Trc et al. 88 All pain outcomes were statistically sig nificant in favor of EHC. However, two outcomes \u2014VAS p ain and VAS p ain at its worst\u2014were not clinically important. Figure 32 presents a summary of the results for chondroitin sulfate. Twenty four out of 64 outcomes were significantly higher for c hondroitin over placebo. The critical outcomes presented in the studies were pain and function. Pain was significantly lower in the glucosamine group for 12 out of 22 outcomes. Of those 12, four outcomes were 273 clinically important and six were possibly clinically important. No statistically significant results were found for any functional outcome. Figure 3 3 presents the meta- analysis results comparing VAS chondroitin sulfate to placebo in VAS p ain scor es. The weighted mean difference revealed that VAS p ain was 11.89 points lower in the chondroitin group than in the placebo group. However , the difference was not clinically important. Pavelka et al. 94 compared piascledine (avocado soybean unsaponifiable) to chondroitin sulfate. The authors measured WOMAC total and subscale scores, as well as VAS p ain, Lequesne index, and concomitant medication use at four, eight , 12, 24 and 32 weeks. None of the 40 outcomes were associated with significant differences between treatment groups. Two studies compared combined chondroitin and glucosamine to placebo. Only two of 11 outcomes were statistically significant in favor of the treatment group. However, one study by Clegg et al. 86 also did a subgroup analysis stratified by severit y. For the moderate to severe osteoarthritis subgroup, the author s found the treatment group to have significantly higher odds of being OARSI responders. Moderate to severe osteoarthritic patients were more likely to achieve 20 % to 50% reductions in WOMAC p ain scores than those who received a placebo. The outcomes were not statistically significant in the total sample or in the mild severity subgroup. 274 Figure 31.

Strength of Recommendation: Strong Description: Evidence is based on two or more \"High\" strength studies with consistent findings for recommending for or against the interventio n. A Strong recomme ndation means that the quality of the supporti ng evidence is high. A harms analysis on this recommendation was not performed. Implications: Practitioners should follow a Strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present. RECOMMENDATION 7B We are unable to recommend for or against the use of acetaminophen, opioids, or pain patches for patients with symptomatic osteoarthritis of the knee. Strength of Recommendation: Inconclusive Description: Evidence from a single low quality study or conflicting findings that do not allow a recommendation for or against the intervention. An Inconclusive recommendation means that there is a lack of compelling evidence that has resulted in an unclear balance between benefits and potential harm. Implications: Practitioners should feel little constraint in following a recommendation labeled as Inconclusive, exercise clinical judgment, and be alert for emerging evidence that clarifies or helps to determine the balance between benefits and potential harm. Patient preference should have a substantial influencing role. RATIONALE This recommendation included studies of both selective (cyclo -oxygenase -2, COX- 2 inhibitors) and non- selective NSAIDs. The endo rsement for NSAIDs was based on 202 favorable outcomes from 19 studies comparing either the selective, non- selective or topical analgesics to placebo. Twelve studies were of selective NSAIDs, four were of non-selective oral NSAIDs, and six were of topical NSAIDs. (Three studies compared multiple types of analgesics to placebo.) Three were high -strength studies, 14 were moderate, and two were of low -strength. The moderate and low strength studies were included because they examined different outcomes than the high strength articles. Out of 202 total outcomes, 171 were statistically significant in favor of the experimental group. Fifteen outcomes were above the MCII threshold and 63 outcomes were possibly clinically significant. The remaining outcomes were nei ther statistically nor clinically significant. Two high- and three moderate - strength studies examining the various outcome measures in this recommendation compared tramadol to placebo. They included outcome measurements with follow up periods that ranged from 8 to 13 weeks in duration. Ten of 14 outcomes were statistically significant in favor of the treatment group. Two statistically significant outcomes (WOMAC pain and stiffness subscale scores) were possibly clinically significant and the other eight o utcomes could not be evaluated. Fishman et al. 95 did not find any statistically significant improvements in pain efficacy between tramadol contramid doses of 100mg, 200mg and 300mg. Beaulieu et found 342 similar treatment effects in tramadol and diclofenac in using WOMAC pain, stiffness and function subscale scales. The recommendation on acetaminophen was downgraded from level B (i.e. Moderate) in the 2008 edition of the guideline to inconclusive in our current guideline. As opposed to the selection criteria previously used, our current systematic review examined acetaminophen separately and found only one relevant study that tested it against placebo (Miceli -Richard et al. 97). Their study found no statistical significance or minimum clinically important improvement to patients compared to placebo. In addition, their findings and the previous clinical guideline were based on the usage of a maximum of 4000 mg of acetaminophen per day, and there has been a recent change to consider reducing the amount of the daily dosage to 3000 mg for over-the -counter patient use ; for example, see this April 2012 reference from the Nevada Medicaid Services: Acetaminophen Dosage Announcement . The maximum prescription dose remains at 4000 mg per day. The work group realizes that many practitioners prefer to start with acetaminophen prior to NSAIDs du e to the side effect profile of NSAIDs. However, we found it unreasonable to recommend a treatment that does not show benefit over placebo. Our literature review found no relevant studies meeting our inclusion criteria on opioids or pain patches for the t reatment of knee osteoarthritis. SUPPORTING EVIDENCE QUALITY Relevant Tables: Table 1 44, Table 1 48-Table 1 54 To summarize, t his recommendation included 731 outcomes from 52 studies of which 107 outcomes were rated as high qu ality, 571 were moderate, and 53 were of low quality. The study by Schnitzer et al.98 was retrospective and evaluated 20 outcomes that were flawed in the hypothesis and blinding domains. One other st udy with six outcomes was not sufficiently blinded.99 Forty -seven studies and 624 outcomes were flawed in the group assignment domain. Twenty -nine studies were flawed in terms of group comparability, and five studies had treatment integrity flaws. There were no flaws in how outcomes were measured in any of the studies. The potential for investigator bias was present in all but one study. APPLICAB ILITY Relevant Tables: Table 144, Table 148- Table 154 All included studies in this recommendation was of moderate applicability. The enrolled patients in 48 of the 52 studies may not have been representative of the osteoarthritis of the knee population seen in clinical practice. Also, the treatment intervention was administered in a manner not consistent with clinical practice in all of the studies. Since 675 out of 731 outcomes were measured on an intent -to-treat basis, a sufficient percentage of enrolled patients were included in the final analysis. 343 FINAL STRENGTH OF EVIDENCE Every study was assigned a moderate applicability rating. The strength of evidence ratings were the same as the quality rating s. A total of 107 outcomes had high strength of evidence, 571 had moderate strength, and 53 had low ratings. Table 144.

placebo. Cox -2 inhibitors were significantly superior to placebo in 114 outcomes.Of these significant outcomes, 43 were at least possibly clinically important, 38 were of unknown clinical importance, and 33 were not clinically significant. The critical outcomes were f unction and stiffness. Nine of 10 functional outcomes were improved in patients who received Cox -2's. One functional outcome was clinically important and eight were possibl y clinically important. Nine of 15 stiffness -related outcomes were at least possibly clinically important in favor of Cox -2's. An additional two outcomes were statistically significant but not clinically important. There was little difference in the efficacies of Cox- 2 inhibitors. Out of 88 total outcomes, 24 were statistically signific ant. However, 23 out of 24 significant outcomes were between high versus lower doses of the same Cox -2's. Only one of 21 critical outcomes was statistically significant in favor of one Cox -2 over another ( WOMAC stiffness; Celecoxib over Rofecoxib ). NSAIDs were compared to placebo based on 35 outcomes, of which 31 were statistically significant in favor of the treatment. Seventeen of these outcomes were at least possibly clinically important, and nine were of unknown clinical importance . An additional nine outcomes were statistically significant in favor of NSAIDs but not clinically important. Pain, function and stiffness were the critical outcomes included in the studies that compared NSAIDs to placebo. All 17 pain outcomes were statistically significant, eight of which were at least possibly clinically important. All three stiffness outcomes were possibly clinically significa nt in favor of NSAIDs. Three of seven functional outcomes were statistically significant indicating improvement in the treatment grou p. There was little difference in the efficacies between various NSAIDs. Thirteen of 91 outcomes were statistically significant endorsing one NSAID over another (table 15 8 ) Thirty -two outcomes compared topical NSAIDs to a placebo /vehicl e control solution. Eighteen of 32 were statistically significant indicating improvement in the treatment group. The critical outcomes were pain, function and stiffness. Twelve of 21 pain outcomes were lessened significantly in the treatment group. Three of four stiffness - related outcomes and the single functional outcome significantly favored topical NSAIDs over placebo. Two studies compared topical NSAIDs to active treatments. Ottillinger et al.100 found no significant differences in VAS p ain scores at 4, 5 and 6 weeks between eltenac .1%, .3% and 1% gels. Rother et al. 101 found insignificant differences in pain and function between Celecoxib and topical Ketoprofen. 429 NSAIDs and Cox -2 inhibitors appeared to be of similar efficacy. Three of 44 outcomes favored Cox -2s over NSAIDs, and only one outcome favored NSAIDs. Pain, stiffness and function were the included critical outcomes. None were statistically significant between the two drug classifications . Diacerein (interleuk in) was compared to placebo based on 25 outcomes. Sixteen outcomes were significantly superior in the treatment group; 13 were possibly clinically important and three were of unknown clinical importance. Ten of 14 critical outcomes (pain , stiffness , and function) were significantly improved in patients who received Diacerein compared to those who received placebo. Forty -four outcomes compared interleukins to NSAIDs. The evidence was mixed on whether one treatment was superior to the other. Twenty -seven outcomes were not statistically significant, 12 endorsed interleukins and five favored NSAIDs. Five studies evaluating 14 outcomes compared Tramadol to placebo. Ten were significantly improved in the treatment group. Five of seven pain outcomes showed Tramadol to be superior over placebo. One of two functional outcomes and one of two stiffness outcomes were statistically significant indicating benefit of Tramadol over placebo. Fishman et al. 95 compared WOMAC pain scores for 100mg, 200mg and 300mg doses of Tramadol. There we re no significant differences by dose. One study found that VAS p ain scores were not significantly different between acetaminophen and placebo.97 Acetaminophen was compared to NSAIDs based on ten outcomes and Cox -2s based on six . Four outcomes significantly favored NSAIDs over acetaminophen but one was not clinically important. Four of six outcomes were superior in patients who received Cox-2s, and two outcomes were significantly better in the acetaminophen group. Network Meta Analysis Network meta -analyses were conducted for the WOMAC s tiffness , WOMAC t otal, and adverse events. Figures 42 through 46 illustrate conceptual path model s of each network meta- analysis that ex amine direct and indirect treatment comparisons. Figures 4 7 through 80 are forest plots summarizing the results of all network meta - analyses separated according to drug c omparison and outcome (pain, function, stiffness, WOMAC total, and adverse events). For example, there is a separate plot for the results of Cox -2s versus NSAIDs, Cox -2s versus Cox -2s, NSAIDs versus NSAIDs. Other plots contain comparisons of Cox-2s and NSA IDs to interleukins and Tramadol . Consistency checks for all network meta -analyses can be found in Appendix XIII. All pairwise effects were statistically compared to indirect treatment effects using the back calculation method described by Dias et al. No indirect effects of any outcome were found to be significantly different than the direct effects in the pairwise meta- analyses. 430 All Cox -2 inhibitors were significantly more effective than placebo for pain. The NSAIDs Aceclofenac, Diclofenac, Naproxen , Naproxcinod, topical Diclofenac and benefit for pain. Topical Eltenac, Aceclofenac, Tenidap and Tenoxicam produced lower pain scores than placebo treatment , but they did not reach statistical significance. Patients who received the opioid Tramadol had significantly lower pai n scores than those in the placebo group . Diacerein (an interleukin) did not have a statistically significant benefit on pain compared to placebo assignment . All active treatments show ed similar efficacy in terms of pain relief. As can be seen in Figures 4 8 through 52 , there we re only two significant treatment comparisons for pain. Patients treated with Rofecoxib reported significa ntly lower pain scores than Celecoxib and Tenoxicam patients. Tramadol, Cox -2 inhibitors, and most all NSAIDs produced possibly clinically important improvements in WOMAC function scores relative to placebo. Two of six NSAIDs, Piroxicam and Tenidap , were associated with better function scores than scores based on placebo, but the differences were not statistically significant. Diacerein were not associated with significantly different function scores than placebo. The active treatments showed similar effi cacy for improving WOMAC function scores (see Figures 54 to 58 ). There were four significant active treatment comparisons. Naproxen produced WOMAC function scores that were significantly higher than all associated with Cox -2 inhibitors and topical Ketoprofen. The differences were possibly clinically important. Analgesics were less successful in treating stiffness related to knee osteoarthritis than they were for improving pain and function. NSAIDs, interleukins and Tramadol did not produce significantly lower WOMAC stiffness scores than placebo. Two of four Cox-2 inhibitors, Celecoxib and Rofecoxib, had possibly clinically important improvements in stiffness compared to placebo. When each active treatment was compared to one another in the network meta -analysis, there were not any significant differences found in WOMAC stiffness scores. All WOMAC total scores for Cox -2 inhibitors, NSAIDs, opioids and interleukins were significantly better than all placebo scores. Each drug treatment effect was possibly clinically important since their confidence intervals contained the MCII. There were no statistically significant differences in overall WOMAC scores f or any of the active treatments. Adverse Events The odds of experiencing adverse events were similar between treatment arms in the network meta -analysis. Pairwise analyses were used to compare specific types of adverse events between analgesics. While the overall occurrence of Gastrointestinal Events are not significantly lower for Cox -2's than for NSAIDs, patients who received Cox -2 inhibitors were significantly less likely to experience abdominal pain, constipation or 431 dyspepsia ( see figure 75). For non gastrointestinal events, there were no significant differences between Cox -2's and NSAIDs ( figure 7 6). Patients who received Acetaminophen did not have significantly different odds of experiencing an y specific adverse event than patients who received Celecoxib ( figure 7 7). Rofecoxib 12.5mg had lesser odds of causing abdominal pain and headaches ( figure 7 8). Compared to Acetaminophen, those who received Rofecoxib 25mg had significantly lesser odds of experiencing diarrhea and a bdominal pain, but greater odds of Lower Extremity Edema ( figure 7 9). Figure 80 presents a comparison of the likelihood of specific adverse events between Acetaminophen (4000mg) and Ibuprofen (1200 and 4000mg). There were no statistically significant diffe rences between the treatments. 432 Figure 42. 5 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 3 1 3 1 1 1 Tenoxicam 1 1 Topical Ketoprofen 1 1 1 1 Acetaminophen 433 Figure 43. 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 3 1 3 1 1 Topical Ketoprofen 1 1 Acetaminophen 1 1 434 Figure 44. 2 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 2 1 3 1 1 2 435 Figure 45.

Strength of Recommendation: Inconclusive Description: Evidence from a single low quality study or conflicting findings that do not allow a recommendation for or against the intervention. An Inconclusive recommendation means that there is a lack of compelling evidence that has resulted in an unclear balance between benefits and potential harm. Implications: Practitioners should feel little constraint in following a recommendation labeled as Inconclusive, exercise clinical judgment, and be alert for emerging evidence that clarifies or helps to determine the balance between benefits and potential harm. Patient preference should have a substantial influencing role. RATIONALE Our se arch found only four placebo comparison s tudies that met criteria and evaluated pain relief for a minimum treatment period of four w eeks.102-105 One study found IA corticosteroids to be s uperior to placebo on WOMAC total subscale scores at four weeks.102 However, a nother study found IA corticosteroid injections inferior to hyaluronic acid injections106 and a third stud y found IA corti costeroids inferior to needle lavage ( tidal irrigation).107Since the evidence in the guideline did not support the use of hyaluronic acid or needle lavage, the work group i nterpreted the evidence to be inconclusive as to the benefit of IA corticosteroids. SUPPORTING EVIDENCE QUALITY Relevant Tables: Table 1 66-Table1 68, Table 1 69-Table 1 71 There were four moderate quality studies that compared intraarticular (IA) c orticosteroids to placebo. None were flawed in the hypothesis, blinding, treatment integrity or measurement domains. All four studies were flawed in the group assignment domain, and three studies were flawed in the group comparability and investigator bias domains. One additional mode rate quality study compared IA corticosteroids to Hylan G -F 20 injections based on 10 outcomes.106 None were flawed in the hypothesis, blinding, treatment integrit y or measu rement domains. They were all flawed in the group assignment, group comparability and investigator bias domains. Another moderate quality study compared cort icosteroids to tidal irrigation.107There was uncertainty about the comparability of the groups at baseline. Also, there was potential for investigator bias in the study. 747 APPLICABILITY Relevant Tables: Table 166- Table168, Table 169- Table 171 In all but one included studies, the participants may not have been representative of those seen in clinical practice. Also, it wa s unclear if any of the studies administered treatme nt similarly provided in clinical settings. Compliance and adhere nce for all included studies were similar to what is seen in clinical practice. Finally, all but one study included all enrolled patients in the final analysis. FINAL STRENGTH OF EV IDENCE Four out of five studies comparing IA corticosteroids to placebo had moderate quality and moderate applicability resulting in a moderate strength of evidence rating. One study had high quality and moderate applicability so its strength of evidence was high . Table 166.

None provide d enough information to determine whether or not the patient population had acute or chronic osteoarthritis of the knee. However, the average symptom duration was several years for six of the studies (the seventh study did not provide average symptom duration), so a majority of the patient population was likely suffering from chronic osteoarthritis . Also, excluding Raynauld et al., all studies included patients with a full range of osteoarthritis severity levels. Five studie s with 19 outcomes compared IA c ortico steroid injections to the placebo assignment. Four of the outcomes were statistically significant in favor of the treatment . Pain and function were the two critical outcomes . There were five pain outcomes and one self reported functional outcome . Of the five pain outcomes, three were statistically significant in favor of IA corticosteroids. However, one of them was not clinically important. The one other outcome, WOMAC Pain (Raynauld et al. 104) was underpowered. The findings were included in a meta -analysis comparing pain in the co rticosteroid and placebo groups . Chao et al.102 and Raynauld et al.104 used the visual analogue versions of WOMAC Pain , and Gaffney et al.103 used the traditional VAS p ain scale (both were 100mm long). Results showed that the treatment group had a lower weig hted mean of 8.8mm on the VAS scale, which was stati stically significant. Since WOMAC p ain and VAS p ain were combined, the clinical importance of IA corticosteroids could not be determined. There were four functional outcomes included. One was the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) and the other three w ere functional task outcomes. Since the HAQ is a self reported measure of function, it wa s a critical outcome. All four functional outcomes were not statistically significant. Carbo rn et al.106 compared IA corticosteroids to Hyla n G-F 20 at 12 and 26 weeks. Ten of 10 outcomes were statist ically significant in favor of h yaluronic acid. WOMAC walking pain and WOMAC f unction were the critical outcom es presented in this study. (See F igure 81 for the results summary .) Arden et al.107 compared IA corticosteroids to tidal irrigation. Clinically significant results were found in favor of corticosteroids for six of 7 outcomes of which WOMAC function and pain were the critical variables. Four of five critical outcomes were significant in favo r of the IA corticosteroid group (see Figure 81 ). 752 Figure 81.

Network Meta -Analysis: IA Corticosteroids Versus Placebo Pain ) 0 -18.4 0 18.4 769 RECOMMENDATION 9 We cannot recommend using hyaluronic acid for patients with symptomatic osteoarthritis of the knee. Strength of Recommendation: Strong Description: Evidence is based on two or more \"High\" strength studies with consistent findings for recommending for or against the intervention. A Strong recommendation means that the quality of the supporting evidence is high. A harms analysis on this recommendation was not performed. Implications: Practitioners should follow a Strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present. RATIONALE Fourteen studies (three high- strength studies and 11 moderate -strength studies) assessed intraarticular hyaluronic acid (HA) injections. A comparison of the patients in these studies and the ones validating the MCIIs we used to judge clinical significance revealed that they were demographically comparable for WOMAC and VAS pain as well as WOMAC function on the basis of age, baseline pain scores, BMI, weight and gender. Meta- analysis in meaningfully important difference (MID) units showed that the over effect was less than 0.5 MID units, indicating a low likelihood that an appreciable number of patients achieved clinically important benefits in the outcomes (Guyatt et al. ). Although meta -analyses of WOMAC pain, function, and stiffness subscales scores all found statistically significant treatment effects, none of the improvements met the minimum clinically important improvement thresholds. When we differentiated high - versus low - molecular weight viscosupplementation, our analyses did show that most of the statistically significant outcomes were associated with high -molecular cross linked hyaluronic acid but when compared to mid- range molecular weight, statistical significance was not maintained. T reatment comparisons between any weights higher than 750 kDa were not significantly different. The strength of this recommendation was based on lack of efficacy, not on potential harm. The 2008 edition of this guideline where the benefits of viscosupplem entation were found to be inconclusive rather than non- affirming used a systematic review from AHRQ that compared Hylan G -F 20 to placebo. Although there was a statistically significant treatment effect associated with the high molecular weight, different pain measurement outcomes (WOMAC and VAS pain) were combined so clinical significance could not be determined. Also, the work group found evidence of publication bias (publicizing of primarily favorable studies). We excluded the AHRQ systematic review because the selection criteria did not match ours. The primary difference was that in the current edition of the guideline clinical efficacy beyond a 4- week treatment period was required for studies to be included. This 2 nd edition was based on meta -analyses t hat combined like measurement instruments, which made it possible to determine that the overall effect of hyaluronic acid did not provide minimum clinically important improvement to patients. Additionally, the AHRQ review included trials of varying researc h-design quality due in part to variations in sample sizes. In AAOS clinical practice guidelines, evidence of lower strength is excluded when there are at least two higher strength studies evaluating an outcome, and we excluded many of the lower strength s tudies 770 included in the AHRQ review since they did not meet our selection criterion of at least 30 patients in each treatment group. Noted in the AHRQ review was that \"T here is evidence consistent with potential publication bias. Pooled results from small t rials (<100 patients) showed effects up to twice those of larger trials consistent with selective publication of underpowered positive trials \" (page 64).\" Future research using clinically relevant outcomes, sub -group analyses, and controls for bias are nee ded. SUPPORTING EVIDENCE QUALITY Relevant Tables: Table 1 75-Table1 76, Table 1 77-Table 1 78 There were 94 outcomes from 14 studies that compared intraarticular hyaluronic acid (HA) inje ctions to control treatments. Twelve compared HA to placebo; one compared the treatment to conventional care, and one compared 25mg s odium hyaluron to .25mg hyaluron. All studies were of moderate quality except Lunds gaard et al. ,108 Huang et al.109 and Puhl et al. ,110 which were rated as high quality. All included studies were prospective a nd had no problems with the way the outcomes were measur ed. Every one , except the studies by Lundsgaard et al. ,108 and Puhl et al. ,110 was flawed in the group assignment domain. Ten out of 14 studies had potential group comparabilit y flaws. Investigator bias was problem atic in 12 out of 14 studies. Also, excluding Day et al. ,111 every study was not flawed in the treat ment integrity domain amd all but one study was sufficiently blinded. There were seven studies with 43 outcomes that compared high versus low molecular weight HA. Fo ur of seven studies were of moderate quality. Juni et al.112 and Maheu et al.113 were high qual ity studies, and Lee et al.114 was a low quality study. None of the molecular weight HA studies were flawed in the prospective hypothesis, blinding or measurement domains. Excluding the articles by Juni et al.112 and Maheu et al.,113 all studies were flawed in the group assignment domain. Three of seven studies were not flawed in group comparability. Juni et al.112 and Raman et al.115 were the only studies with limited po tential for investigator bias. The Raman et al.115 and Lee et al.114 studies were flawed in the treatment integrity domain. APPLICABILITY Relevant Tables: Table 175- Table176, Table 177- Table 178 For all studies th at compared HA to a control group, there was uncertainty if the treatments were applied in a manner reflecting clinical practice. In all but two studies, there was uncertainty about whether the patients were representative of the typical patient population. Karlsson et al.116 were the only researchers who did not include all enrolled patients in the final ana lysis. No unusual steps were taken by investigators in any of the studies to ensure a level of patient compliance beyond what is typically found in clinical settings. 771 Five out of seven molecular weight studies had participants that may not have been representative of the general osteoarthritis of the knee population. Each molecular weight study was flawed since the intervention was not applied in a similar manner to clinical practice. Only the Karlsson et al.116 molecular weight study did not include all patients in the final analysis. Final ly, compliance and adherence were similar to typ ical clinical practice in every study. FINAL STRENGTH OF EV IDENCE Thirteen out of 18 studies were rated as having moderate streng th of evidence. Four studies were rated as having high evidence strength, and one low strength. Due to the moderate applicabilit y ratings for all outcomes, every strength of evidence rating was the same as the quality rating s. Table 175.

Figure 88 shows the pooled weighted m ean differences between HA and p lacebo for WOMAC p ain. The meta- analysis excludes the studies by Kahan et al.117 and Altman et al.118 because they were both significant causes of heterogeneity in the model. Kahan et al.117 did not blind the patients or investigators. The lack of blinding caused a much larger treatment effect than was found in the other studies, which is where the heterogeneity originated . The Altman et al.118 study enrolled significantly more women in the placebo group than in the treatment group. T he authors note that the statistically insignificant results of the primar y analysis may have be en confounded by the inclusion of patients whose osteoarthritis was not confined to the knee. When they analyze d a subgroup of patients with osteoarthritis localized to the knee, they found that responder rates (40% reduction in WOMAC pain with a minimum improvement of five points) were significantly higher in the treatment group When the Kahan et al.117 and Altman et al.118 studies were r emoved from the analysis, the HA group reported significantly lower pain scores than the control group. This difference was not clinically significant since the lower bound of the confidence inte rval was higher than the MCII ( Figure 88 ). 783 Figure 89 shows the meta -analysi s results for p ain on weight bearing/movement. Each outcome was measured by the Visual Analogue Scale. Again the results were statistically significant but not clinically important. Seven of 16 function outcomes were statistically significant in favor of HA over the control treatments. Figure 90 contains the results for a meta -analysis of the difference in function scores between the HA and placebo groups. Each study used WOMAC f unction (scaled to 100mm VAS) as an outcome. Altman e t al.118 and Kahan et al.117 were again excluded from the analysis to reduce the heterogeneity to an acceptable level . The final results indicate that HA did produce statistically significant improvement in function but the effect was not clinically important. One of eight WOMAC s tiffness outcomes was statistically significant in favor of HA over the control assignment . Results of the meta -analysis for this outcome can be found in Figure 91. Again, Altman et al.118 and Kahan et al.117 were excluded. The results showed that WOMAC s tiffness scores were significantly lower in patients receiving HA than thos e in the control group but the difference was no t clinically important. Kahan et al.117 compared WOMAC t otal scores between treatment and control groups. They found that patients who received HA plus conventional treatment reported significantly better scores than those who received only usual care and the difference was clinically important. There were nine Lequesne index outcomes comparing HA and control trea tments. Only one was statistically significant in favor of HA. There was evidence to suggest that high molecular weight HA s were more effective than those with lower weights. Eight of 12 pain outcomes significantly favored Hylan G -F 20 (6 million Da) over placebo assignment. N ine of the 12 statistically significant placebo - compared pain outcomes were of HA s of at least 2.4 million Daltons. Five of six placebo -compared function al ou tcomes that compared HA of at least 2.4 million Daltons to placebo were statistically significant in favor of the treatment group. Also, high molecular weight HA accounted for five of the seven significant pain outcomes. O ut of eight WOMAC stiffness outcom es, the only one that was statistically significant compared to placebo was for Hylan G -F 20 (6 million Da). Six of seven pain outcomes were statistically significant i n favor of Hylan G -F 20 over HAs with a molecular weight of .5 to .75 Daltons. These tr eatments represent ed the highest and lowest mol ecular weight HA s, and the results suggest ed statistically and possibly clinically important differences in fav or of Hylan G -F 20. Three outcomes were possibly clinically important, and the other three were in determinable. There were not any statistically significant differences between high and medium molecular weight HA s, or between the med ium and low molecular weights . 784 Figure 83.

Strength of Recommendation: Inconclusive Description: Evidence from a single low quality study or conflicting findings that do not allow a recommendation for or against th e intervention. An Inconclusive recommendation means that there is a lack of compelling evidence that has resulted in an unclear balance between benefits and potential harm. Implications: Practitioners should feel little constraint in following a recommendation labeled as Inconclusive, exercise clinical judgment, and be alert for emerging evidence that clarifies or helps to determine the balance between benefits and potential harm. Patient preference should have a substantial influencing role. RAT IONALE There was a paucity of articles on the use of platelet concentrates in the treatment of osteoarthritis. Sanchez et al.119;120 used activated platelet aggregates in a fibrin matrix and Spakova et al.121 used a platelet concentrate. None of the studies controlled for platelet volume. All studies used hyaluronic acid as the control group. The studies showed decreased levels of pa in in the post injection period but they were not constructed to allow for a comparative analysis of clinical effectiveness. The lack of controlled prospective blinded randomized clinical trials with a placebo control prevent the work group from making any recommendation on the use of platelets or platelet derived growth factor concentrates in the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee. SUPPORTING EVIDENCE QUALITY Relevant Tables: Table 190, Table 191 Three studies were evaluated as part of this recommendation. Sanchez et al.119;120 compared growth factor injections to hyaluronic acid; the other compared platelet rich plasma to hyaluronic acid. 121 Sanchez et al.119 was retrospective and had flaws in the investigator bias, blinding and group assignment domains. There was also questionable group comparability at baseline. The quality rating was determined to be low. The second study by Sanchez et al.120 was of high quality; it was not flawed in any domain. The platelet rich plasma (PRP) study by Spakova et al.121 was of moderate quality. There was uncertain allocation concealment causing the group assignment domain to be flawed as well as potential for investigator bias . APPLICABILITY Relevant Tables: Table 190, Table 191 The participants might not have been representative of the typical patient population in all included studies. In the growth factor studies , the treatment administration might not have been reflective. Pati ent compliance and adherence were similar to general clinical 854 settings in all studies and there were a sufficient percentage of originally enr olled patients in the final analyses. FINAL STRENGTH OF EV IDENCE Because of their moderate applicability, all studies had the same quality and strength of evidence ratings. Sanchez et al.119 was of low strength of evidence, and the second Sanchez et al.120 was of high strength. Spakova et al.121 was of moderate strength of evidence. Table 190.

The authors found that patients receiving growth factor were significa ntly more likely to achieve a 40% improvement in WOMAC p ain. WOMAC f unction and total scores were significantly better in the group treated with growth factor than the group treated with hyaluronic a cid. However, another study by Sanchez et al.119 found conflicting results, in which only 1 of 8 outcomes favored growth factor treatments. Spakova et al.121 found that patients who received platelet rich plasma reportedly significantly lower pain at 13 and 26 weeks than those who received hyaluronic acid. WOMAC t otal scores were also significantly lower in the PRP group. The difference was possibly clinically significant at 13 weeks and clinically significant at 26 weeks. 856 EVIDENCE TABLES AND FIGURES QUALITY A ND APPLICABILITY Table 191.

Strength of Recommendation: Moderate Description: Evidence from two or more \"Moderate\" strength studies with consistent findings, or evidence from a single \" High\" quality study for recommending for or against the intervention. A Moderate recommendation means that the benefits exceed the potential harm (or that the potential harm clearly exceeds the benefits in the case of a negative recommendation), but the qu ality/applicability of the supporting evidence is not as strong. Implications: Practitioners should generally follow a Moderate recommendation but remain alert to new information and be sensitive to patient preferences. RATIONALE This recommendation is based on one high strength study by Bradley et al.122 and one moderate strength study by Vad et al.123 The evidence showed little or no benefit from needle lavage in the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee. Fourteen of 15 outcomes were not statistically significant, including three pain and three functional outcomes, indicating no measurable benefit to patients from needle lavage. SUPPORTING EVIDENCE QUALITY Relevant Tables: Table 194, Table 197, Table 19 8 Two studies compared patients undergoing needle lavage to a control group. The Bradley et al.122 study did not contain flaws in any of the quality domains and was rated as high quality. The study by Vad et al.123 was a moderate quality non- randomized control trial. Patients were able to choose their treatment creating a flaw in the group assignment domain. There was also questionable comparability of the groups at baseline; the authors did not use a test of statistical significance when comparing the pre -test outcome scores. Arden et al. 107 compared needle lavage and intraarticular corticosteroids using a research design that resulted in a moderate quality study. There was questionable comparability of the groups at baseline and potential for investigator bias. 863 APPLICABILITY Relevant Tables: Table 194, Table 197, Table 198 All studies were of moderate applicability. Compliance and adherence reflected typical clinical practice. The studies included all originally enrolled patients in the final analyses. However, treatment interventions were applied in a manner that might have been unrepresentative of typical clinical settings in each study. The patients might not have been typical of the osteoarthritis of the knee population in the Bradley et al. 122 and Arden et al.107 studies. FINAL STRENGTH OF EV IDENCE The included studies were of moderate applicability so their strength of evidence ratings were comparable to their study quality ratings . The Bradley et al. 122 study was rated as high strength of evidence, and the Arden et al.107 study was of moderate strength. Table 194.

WOMAC function scores were not statistically significant at 12, 24 and 52 weeks. The quality of well -being scores were not statistically significant at 24 weeks and after one year. There were seven total outcomes comparing needle lavage and IA corticosteroids. Six were possibly clinically significant in favor of lavage . WOMAC p ain was the only critical outcome .

Strength of Recommendation: Strong Description: Evidence is based on two or more \"High\" strength studies with consistent findings for recommending for or against the intervention. A Strong recommendation means that the quality of the supporting evidence is high. A harms analysis on this recommendation was not perf ormed. Implications: Practitioners should follow a Strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present. RATIONALE There were three studies that met the inclusion criteria for this recommendation. The Kirkley et. al124 and Kalunian et. al125 studies comparing arthroscopic lavage to placebo were rated as moderate strength and the Moseley et al.126 study comparing arthroscopic lavage to sham arthroscopic surgery was rated as a high strength study. Kirkley et al. 124 reported that a large number of patients were not eligible for participation in their study (38%) largely due to the exclusion criteria of substantial knee malalignment. In some cases, patients declined participation. Kirkely et al. 124 compared arthroscopic surgery to lavage and debridement combined with usual physical therapy and medic al treatment, usual care. The authors used the pain, functional status and other symptoms subscales of the Arthritis Self -Efficacy Scale (ASES) and the McMaster - Toronto Arthritis Patient Preference Disability Questionnaire (MACTAR) at multiple time points (ranging from three months to two years). Out of 20 outcomes, only two were statistically significant in favor of surgery with lavage. Differences in AIMS pain were statistically significant at three months and differences in AIMS -Other Arthritis Symptoms subscale scores remained significant after two years. In summary, this randomized controlled trial demonstrated no benefit of arthroscopic surgery compared to physical therapy and medical treatment for osteoarthritis of the knee. Kalunian et al. 125 included a large number of enrolled pa tients from one institution with intraarticular crystals in their knee. They compared arthroscopic lavage with 3,000 ml saline to lavage with 250 ml saline. There were not any statistically significant differences in VAS and WOMAC pain scores between the t wo treatment groups. The Moseley et al.126 study raised questions regarding its limited sampling (mostly male veterans) as well as the number of potential study participants who declined randomization into a treatment group. In this RCT, the effects of arthroscopy with debridement or lavage were not statistically significant in the vast majority of patient oriented outcome mea sures for pain and function, at multiple time points from one week to two years following surgery. Collectively all three included studies did not demonstrate clinical benefit of arthroscopic debridement or lavage. The work group also considered the potential risks to patients 876 (anesthesia intolerance, infection, and venous thrombosis) associated with surgical intervention. It was agreed that the lacking evidence for treatment benefit and increased risks from surgery were sufficient reasons to recommend ag ainst arthroscopic debridement and/or lavage in patients with a primary diagnosis of osteoarthritis of the knee. None of the evidence we examined specifically included patients who had a primary diagnosis of meniscal tear, loose body, or other mechanical derangement, with concomitant diagnosis of osteoarthritis of the knee. The present recommendation does not apply to such patients. SUPPORTING EVIDENCE QUALITY Relevant Tables: Table 204, Table 2 05 Three studies met the inclusion criteria for this recommendation. The Moseley et al.126 study was of high quality. The studies by Kirkely et al.124 and Kalunian et al.125 were of moderate quality. The Moseley et al.126 study was not flawed in any quality domain. Both moderate quality studies124;125 were flawed in the group assignment and group comparability domains and the Kalunian et al. study was also flawed in treatment integrity. APPLICABILITY Relevant Tables: Table 204, Table 205 In all three studies, the participants might not have been representative of the osteoarthritis of the knee patient population. Furthermore, the application of t he intervention might not have been the same as what is practiced in regular clinical settings. At the same time, compliance and adherence were typical . Two of the three studies included all originally enrolled patients in the final analyses. 124;125 FINAL STRENGTH OF EV IDENCE All moderate and high quality outcomes were paired with comparable ratings for strength of evidence since all study applicability ratings were moderate. 877 Table 204.

compared arthroscopic debridement and arthroscopic lavage to placebo using the AIMS -pain and AIMS -walking and bending instruments. Each outcome was measured at six weeks, 13 weeks, 26 weeks, 1 year, 78 weeks, and 2 years. Neither debridement nor lavage was associated with statistically significant treatment effects over placebo at any follow -up time. Also, debridement was not statistically better than lavage. As indicated above, Kirkle y et al.124 compared arthroscopic surgery with lavage and debridement combined with usual physical and medical therapy to a control group who only received usual care. The authors used the pain, functional status and other sympt oms subscales of the Arthritis Self -Efficacy Scale (ASES) and the McMaster -Toronto Arthritis Patient P reference Disability Question naire (MACTAR). The follow up periods were three months, six months, one year, 18 months and two years. Out of 20 outcomes, only tw o were statistically significant in favor of surgery wi th lavage. Differences in AIMS p ain were statistically significant at three months and differences in AIMS -Other Arthritis Symptoms scores remained significant after two years. Kalunian et al.125 compared arthroscopic lavage with 3,000 ml saline to lavage with 250 ml saline. There were not any statistically significant differe nces in VAS and WOMAC pain scores between the two groups. 887 Figure 92.

Strength of Recommendation: Inconclusive Description: Evidence from a single low quality study or conflicting findings that do not allow a recommendation for or against the intervention. An Inconclusive recommendation means that there is a lack of compelling evidence that has resulted in an unclear balance between benefits and potential harm. Implications: Practitioners should feel little constraint in following a recommendation labeled as Inconclusive, exercise clinical judgment, and be alert for emerging evidence that clarifies or helps to determine the balance between benefits and potential harm. Patient prefer ence should have a substantial influencing role. RATIONALE Currently, arthroscopic partial meniscectomy is routinely performed in patients with symptomatic osteoarthritis of the knee who also have primary signs and symptoms of a torn meniscus. Herrlin et al.127 compared arthroscopic partial meniscectomy followed by supervised exercise to supervised exercise alone and measured KOOS pain, symptoms, activities of daily life, sports/recre ation, and quality of life subscales scores as outcomes. The study was downgraded from moderate - to low - strength because 40% of patients declined participation and the arthroscopic group had non- homogeneous preoperative KOOS scores. The authors reported no significant treatment benefits of meniscectomy using any of the outcomes at eight weeks and six months. Since there was only one low -strength study, the recommendation was graded inconclusive. SUPPORTING EVIDENCE QUALITY Relevant Tables: Table 2 16-Table 2 17 One moderate quality study by Herrlin et al.127 met the inclusion criteria for this recommendation. The study was flawed in the group assignment, group comparability and investigator bias domains. APPLICABILITY Relevant Tables: Table 216- Table 217 The patients and the treatment administration might not have been representative of typical clinical practice settings. FINAL STRENGTH OF EV IDENCE Ratings of moderate quality and applicability resulted in a moderate strength of evidence rating for all included outcomes in the study. 932 Table 216.

Strength of Recommendation: Limited Description: Evidence from two or more \"Low\" strength studies with consistent findings, or evidence from a single Moderate quality study recommending for or against the intervention or diagnostic. A Limited recommendation means that the quality of the supp orting evidence is unconvincing, or that well -conducted studies show little clear advantage to one approach over another. Implications: Practitioners should exercise clinical judgment when following a recommendation classified as Limited , and should be al ert to emerging evidence that might counter the current findings. Patient preference should have a substantial influencing role. RATIONALE Nine low -strength case series studies found nine out of 10 outcomes significantly improved from baseline. A cross -sectional time series regression analysis was used to predict the placebo effect on VAS pain for comparison to that of the treatment group. Compared to the predicted placebo effect on VAS pain, the proximal tibial osteotomy group reported decreased pain on the VAS. Based on a lack of appropriate studies, distal femoral (varus producing) osteotomy was not evaluated. SUPPORTING EVIDENCE QUALITY Relevant Tables: Table 2 19-Table 2 20, Table 2 21-Table 2 22 Data on 48 outcomes in nine studies were analyzed for this recommendation. Eight studies were prospective case series, and were flawed in the group assignment, blinding, group compar ability, and treatment integrity domains. Six included studies had some form of investigator bias. All studies used valid measurements for the outcomes. All eight case series studies were given low quality ratings. Two additional studies were included th at compared closed to open wedge osteotomy. Brouwer et al. 128 was not flawed in six of the seven quality domains, giving it a high rating. Its only quality flaw was that the evaluators were not blinded to the treatment patients received. The Song et al.129 study was of low quality, and was flawed in every domain except treatment integrity and measurement validity. APPLICABILITY Relevant Tables: Table 219- Table 220, Tabl e 221 -Table 222 All case series studies were rated as having moderate applicability. Each study raised uncertainty about whether or not the treatment and practitioners who administered them were typical of those encountered in c linical practice. Patients in four out of eight case series studies might not have been representative of the treatment seeking population. 939 Two case series studies did not include all enrolled patients in t he final data analyses of its outcomes. The applic ability of the studies comparing open to closed wedge osteotom y was rated as moderate. There was uncertainty regarding whether the treatment and practitioners who administered them were similar to those seen in typical clinical practice. FINAL STRENGTH OF EVIDENCE Since all the case series osteotomy outcomes were of low quality and were paired with moderate applicability ratings, they were evaluated as comprising low strength of evidence. Of the studies that compared open to closed wedge osteotomy , one was of high and the other was of low strength of evidence. Table 219.

El -Azab et al.131 also measured VAS p ain in patients three years after receiving osteotomy. A cross sectional time series regression equation computed from the placebo data allowed the prediction of expect ed reduction in pain based on these two studies, given the average age of the sample, average baseline score, and follow -up duration if osteotomy were no more effective than a placebo. At each follow -up period, pain scores were significantly lower than pre dicted placebo scores in the Pongsoipetch et al. study . 130 The predicted placebo VAS p ain score after three years for the patient population was 40.35(34.33, 46.35). The actual VAS p ain score after three years in the osteotomy group was 23(13.3, 32.7), which was significantly lower than the predicted placebo score. Another study measured the Hospital for Special Surgery pain and function scores .132 While pain was found to have significantly improve d from baseline, function did not. Other outcomes included the International Knee Documentation Subjective Score, Knee Society Score, and the International Knee Society Score. All outcomes we re associated with statistically significant improvements from baseline. The remaining outcomes were used to indicate prevalence of the different types of adverse events among patients who underwent osteotomy (see Table 2 24).

Strength of Recommendation: Consensus Description: The supporting evidence is lacking and requires the work group to make a recommendation based on expert opinion by considering the known potential harm and benefits associated with the treatment . A Consensus recommendation means that expert opinion sup ports the guideline recommendation even though there is no available empirical evidence that meets the inclusion criteria of the guideline's systematic review. Implications: Practitioners should be flexible in deciding whether to follow a recommendation c lassified as Consensus, although they may give it preference over alternatives. Patient preference should have a substantial influencing role. RATIONALE One published case series reported the results of free -floating (un- fixed) interpositional device surgery for treatment of medial unicompartmental OA of the knee.129 We determined that the evidence was low -strength. The evidence indicated high reoperation rates in the patients who were followed. Thirty - two percent of patients were revised to total kne e arthroplasty. The evidence showed differences from baseline that were not clinically or statistically significant for increased pain measured with the VAS two years postoperatively. Knee Society Score function subscale scores were \"poor\" postoperatively. The AAOS workgroup modified the grade of this recommendation to consensus, because of the high revision rates in this study, increased pain, and the potential harm associated with this intervention (anesthesia risks, VTE, infection, and reoperation). SUPPORTING EVIDENCE QUALITY Relevant Tables: Table 227, Table 2 28 All four of the included outcomes were from a study by Sisto and Mitchell133 that followed a prospective case series design. Every outcome was flawed in the group assignment, blinding, group comparability and treatment integrity domains. Consequently, they were all rated as low quality. APPLICABILITY Relevant Tables: Table 227, Table 228 The Sisto and Mitchell133 study was of moderate applicability because of uncertainty regarding whether the treatment was delivered in the same manner as in regular clinical practice, and the enrolled patients might not have been representative of patients typically seen in clinical practice. 969 FINAL STRENGTH OF EV IDENCE The moderate applicability of the Sisto and Mitchell133 study in combination with low quality of its outcomes resulted in a low strength of evidence ratin g.

The quality of these trials is, in some cases, questionable. To achieve a high quality literature base, clinicians and scientists should invest their time and eff ort in studies designed to avoid bias. Some techniques to limit bias include stochastic randomization and blinding of investigators or evaluators and patients. Future studies should include a priori power analyses to adequately power the studies to be able to detect minimum clinically important improvements (MCII; improvements that matters to the patient). Studies should likewise utilize patient reported outcomes (i.e. Oxford Knee Score, EQ - 5D, and Visual Analog Scales) whose measurement properties have been validated. The use of standardized pain and function measures will ensure that efficacy evaluated in future studies can be analyzed on the basis of clinical significance to offset the limitations of interpreting only the p -value. Commensurate with these steps, investigators should better define the hypotheses of the treatment studies. For example, does a two year follow -up analysis accurately reflect the expected outcomes of one intraarticular corticosteroid injection? While some of the non- operative treatments of knee osteoarthritis have higher level clinical evidence, the availability of strong evidence is not consistent across interventions. Several of the relatively commonly prescribed treatments, such as the use of acetaminophen and intraarticular corticosteroid injections, are in need of higher strength studies to support and define their use and indications. Better and higher strength evidence for surgical treatment (up to but not including knee arthroplasty) of knee osteoarthritis has been published since the original CPG, but is still insufficient to answer the questions that patients and orthopaedic surgeons have regarding their use. The resource difficulties and ethical concerns about conducting placebo controlled studies of operative interventions compromise the quality of these studies. To improve the quality of future studies of operative treatments, the use of nonsurgical, non- placebo control groups should be considered. Surgical treatments for knee osteoarthritis are often indicated in patient s exhibiting unique symptoms from other pathologies (i.e. loose body, meniscal tear) in addition to the symptoms from osteoarthritis of the knee, or in patients with a specific characteristics (i.e. young age, high activity level, or end -stage severity of the osteoarthritis). Investigators should develop rigorous patient inclusion criteria to ensure that patients who typically receive the surgical intervention in clinical practice are adequately represented in the study population (including adequate statis tical power of key patient subgroups to allow subgroup analyses). The evidence analysis of this second edition raised specific questions for the clinicians who were either directly involved in its development or indirectly involved through peer review. The lack of clinically significant outcomes in viscosupplementation treatment groups could be due to the inability to distinguish responders from non- responders. Additionally, it might be that current widely used outcome measures are not broad enough in scope to detect such improvements as, for example, family reported gains in functional autonomy in patients who themselves report no effect. Higher statistically powered studies are needed to allow for these types of subgroup analyses. Without an 974 evidence -based method of identifying prognostic characteristics of patients who might benefit from the treatment, non -operative treatment options for patients with serious medical co -morbidities and who are not candidates for knee arthroplasty are limited. There are v alid concerns about the side effect profile of nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs and tramadol (addiction and withdrawal). As future measures are developed it might be possible to evaluate gastrointestinal bleeds and infection not detected in Oxford Knee Score, EQ -5D, and VAS outcomes. Currently, the adverse effects of tramadol have not been adequately reported in the knee osteoarthritis literature, perhaps because efficacy studies have focused on short -term outcomes (up to 13 weeks). The data reported in this guideline focuses on treatment efficacy. Reviewing the potential risks of every medication was beyond the scope of this clinical practice guideline from the beginning. Physicians must be knowledgeable about the potential side effects of the treatmen ts they prescribe especially when using them long term. Complicating this task is that tramadol is studied less frequently than other medications. Additionally, randomized clinical trials cannot reliably identify uncommon and serious adverse reactions or t he effects of long term use. Observational studies and registries are needed to provide robust estimates of adverse event rates based on patient demographics and co- morbidities. Empirical evidence will always be limited by the \"rules\" of evidence- based med icine. It is the hope of this Work Group that the detailed review of knee osteoarthritis treatment evidence will provide a background for future high- quality clinical trials to improve our evidence base and improve the clinical treatment of patients with osteoarthritis of the knee. 975 APPENDIX I WORK GROUP REVISION WORK GROUP David S.

Board of Directors The 17 member Board of Directors manage the affairs of the AAOS, set policy, and overse e the Strategic Plan. 980 APPENDIX III DETERMINING CRITICAL OUTCOMES WORK GROUP PARTICIPATION The first task of the work group is to i dentify the critical outcomes for the guide line. Members are asked to construct a preliminary list of important outcomes prior to attending the introductory meeting. They participate in three Delphi rounds, completing the \"Critical Outcomes Form\" shown below. CRITICAL OUTCOMES FO RM DETERMINING OUTCOMES The first task as a guideline work group member is to determine outcomes . List the variables you think are relevant and rank them in order of importance. Appropriate outcomes are patient -centered and consider the benefits and potential harm of the treatments being measured . Criticality Some outcomes are more important than others. The most important ones are considered critical . Critical outcomes are vital for determining whether or not you should offer a treatment or diagnostic test to a patient. Without knowing wha t the essential outcomes are and how the treatment or test influences them, efficacy cannot be determined. Patient -Oriented Outcomes In general, good practice and good evidence -based medicine give priority to the outcomes that patients care about. Patient -oriented outcomes: Help the patient live longer or better Are typically something the patient experiences Are often the patient's diagnostic or treatment goal(s) Do not require extrapolation or interpolation to determine their importance to the patient Examples of patient -oriented outcomes are: Survival/mortality Pain relief Fracture prevention Functional s tatus Quality of l ife 981 Surrogate Outcomes Patient -oriented outcomes contrast surrogate ones in that the latter : Substitute measures for patient- oriented outcomes Are typically not experienced by the patient Are typically not the patient's goals for treatment Require extrapolation or interpolation to determine their relationship to (or effect on) patient -oriented outcomes Examples of surrogate outcomes are: Blood cholesterol (a surrogate for survival) Bone mineral density (a surrogate for fractures) All imaging results ( often surrogate s for pain or functional status but they can also be surrogates for othe r patient -oriented outcomes ) Benefit v ersus Harm Potential benefit to patients is based on the patient -oriented outcomes that they desire and potential ha rm can be thought of as patient -oriented outcomes unwanted to them . For example, avoiding harm (e.g. fractures or death) is considered a benefit. For Consideration Not taking the time to develop appropriate critical outcomes has been known to detrimentally affect the strength of the final recommendations, and on occasion prevent being able to make a recommend ation for a treatment or diagnostic test of clinical importance . Rating Outcomes In addition to identifying patient outcomes, work group members rated the importance of each one using a scale of 1 to 9. The rating categories are sh own in the table below: Rating Importance 9 Critical 8 7 6 Important 5 4 3 Not Important 2 1 982 Work group members were advised to note that: 1. Unless you are interested in measures of diagnostic test performance (i.e., sensitivity and specificity), surrogate outcomes may not be rated as \"Critical\" (7- 9). 2. If all outcomes are rated as critically important, then it will not be possible to prioritize the ones that are more likely to generate a comprehensive list of initial recommendations. Final Determinations To determine which outcomes to include and designate as critical, three rounds of the Delphi method were used . The form below was used by the work group. Please list up to 10 outcomes that you think this guideline should address, and r ate them in order of importance on a scale from 1- 9. Do not consult with other members of the work group during this step. Outcome Number Outcome Rating 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 This form was circulated three times. 983 In the present guideline, the work group identified six critical outcomes: knee pain, activities of daily living, quality of life, functional status, activity tolerance, and self - reported physical function. The work group identified the following outcomes as important: performance based physical function, serious GI bleed, ability to perform recreational activities, survival, treatment side effects, surgical complications, night time pain affecting sleep, major surgery complications, revision surgery, ability to e arn income, ability to drive, social role function, joint stiffness, stability, range of motion, minor GI bleed, avoidance of need for knee replacement, strength, limpness, prevention of disease progression, deformity, joint alignment and stability, and joint swelling/effusion. The work group identified the following outcomes as unimportant: radiographic impro vement, MRI findings, and biomarker improvement. 984 APPENDIX IV STUDY ATTRITION FLOW CHART Attrition chart 9,279 citations identified in literature search 2,222 articles recalled for full text review 7,057 abstracts excluded 2,004 articles excluded 218 articles considered for recommendations 93 systematic reviews were screened 985 APPENDIX V LITERATURE SEARCH ST RATEGIES PUBMED/MEDLINE Search conditioning fitness/de ((balanc* OR flexib* OR gait OR proprioception OR sensorimotor OR endurance) AND training) OR strategy Knee*:ti,ab AND osteoarthriti*:ti,ab AND (nonsurgical OR non- surgical OR exercise OR walking OR 'gait training' OR conditioning OR 'self care' OR ' self-management OR obesity OR OR nerve stimulation' OR 'neuromuscular electrical stimulation' OR lase r OR acupuncture OR electroacupuncture OR 'dry needling' OR OR OR 990 balneology OR iontophoresis OR orthotic OR brace O R 'heel wedge' OR 'heel wedges' OR supplement OR vitamin OR herbal OR methylsulfonylmethane OR 'omega 3' OR 'fish oil' OR glucosamine OR 'dimethyl OR antioxidant* OR 'coenzyme evice') replacement):ti 991 APPENDIX VI QUALITY AND APPLICAB ILITY APPRAISAL QUALITY Quality questions are asked for every outcome reported in a study. They vary according to the rigor of a study's research design. Different questions are asked depending on if a study uses a controlled design with a no- treatment comparison group, is a crossover or historically controlled study, or case series. A total of 20 questions are asked for each type of research design and are des cribe d below: Quality Questions and Domains for Four Designs of Studies of Treatment Studies Domain Question: Parallel, Contemporary Controls Crossover Trials Historical Controls Case Series Group Assignment Stochastic Yes Yes No No Group Assignment Quasi -random Assignment No No No *NA Group Assignment Matched Groups No No Yes No Group Assignment Consecutive Enrollment NA NA NA Yes Prospective Prospective Yes Yes Yes Yes Blinding Blinded Patients Yes Yes No No Blinding Blinded Assessors Yes Yes No No Blinding Blinding Verified Yes Yes No No Group Comparability Allocation Concealment Yes Yes No No Group Comparability >80% Follow -up Yes Yes No Yes Group Comparability <20% Completion Difference Yes Yes No No Group Comparability Similar Baseline Outcome Values Yes NA Yes No Group Comparability Comparable Pt.

We characterize this domain as free from flaws if any one of the following is true: The results of a statistical test on the outcome of interest are statistically significant (statistical significance is indic ative of adequate statistical power). The results of a statistical test of the outcome of interest are not statistically significant (or it is unclear whether the results are statistically significant), and the study is either an uncontrolled study in which data from 34 or more patients are included in the statistical analysis of the outcome of interest OR a controlled study in which data from 128 or more patients are included in the analysis of the outcome of interest. The study's results for the outcome of interest are used in a meta- analysis. We make this assumption because one reason for performing a meta- analysis is to compensate for the low statistical power of individual studies. Implicit in this assumption is a second assumption; that the power of the meta -analysis will be sufficient to detect an effect as statistically significant. We term the power domain as flawed if all of the following are true: The results of a statistical test on the outcome of interest are either not statistically significant or it is unclear whethe r the results of statistical test on the outcome of interest are statistically significant. The study is an uncontrolled study in which data from fewer than 15 patients are included in the analysis of the outcome of interest OR the study is a controlled study in which data from fewer than 52 patients were included in the analysis of the outcome of interest. The results on the outcome of interest will not be used in a meta -analysis. 993 The numbers used to determine whether a study is of sufficient power are based on Cohen's134 definitions of small, medium, and large effects. To compute the number of patients needed for an uncontrolled study using a pretest/posttest des ign, we consider a two-tailed paired samples t -test. We then determine whether or not sample size is sufficient to detect a large effect (defined as a standardized mean difference of 0.8) with alpha = 0.05 significance level and power = 80%. If a study does not have the ability to detect even a large effect as statistically significant, we characterize it as underpowered and the domain flawed. To compute the number of patients needed for a controlled study, we consider a two-tailed independent samples t-test with equal size groups, and then determine if sample size is adequate for detecting a large effect, again with alpha = 0.05 and power = 80%. Similar to the above, we term a study as underpowered and the domain flawed if it does not enroll enough patients to detect a large effect size. It is viewed as adequately powered if it enrolls enough patients to detect a small effect. Quality Domains for Incidence and Prevalence studies # Domain Relationship between Quality and Domain Scores for Incident and Prevalence studies 1 Outcome: Whether the study is measuring the incidence/prevalence of a clinically meaningful event. 0 Flawed Domains = High Quality Study 1 Flawed Domain = Moderate Quality Study 2 Flawed Domains = Low Quality Study 3 Flawed Domains = Very Low Quality Study 2 Measurement: Whether the study measured the disease/disorder/condition in a way that would lead to accurate estimates of incidence or prevalence. 3 Participant: Whether those who were studied were representative of the population of interest. 4 Investigator Bias: Whether author biases could have prejudiced the results. 994 Quality Domains for Screening & Diagnosis studies # Domain Relationship between Quality and Domain Scores for Screening and Diagnosis studies 1 Participants: Whether the spectrum of disease among the participants enrolled in the study is the same as the spectrum of disease seen in actual clinical practice 0 Fla wed Domains = High Quality Study 1 Flawed Domain = Moderate Quality Study 2 Flawed Domains = Low Quality Study 3 Flawed Domains = Very Low Quality Study 2 Reference Test: Whether the reference test , often a \"gold standard\" and the way it was employed in the study ensures correct and unbiased categorization of patients as having or not having disease 3 Index Test: Whether interpretation of the results of the test under study, often called the \"index test\", was unbiased 4 Study Design: Whether the design of the study allowed for unbiased interpretation of test results 5 Information: Whether the same clinical data were available when test results were interpreted as would be available when the test is used in practice 6 Reporting: Whether the patients, tests, and study protocol were described well enough to permit its replication 995 Quality Domains for Prognostic studies Domain Relationship between Quality and Domain Scores for Prognosis Studies 1 Prospective: With prospective studies, a variable is specified as a potential prognostic variable a priori.

Pleas e list the harms (as demonstrated by the systematic review) of the intervention. Please list the benefits for which the systematic review is not definitive. Please list the harms for which the systematic review is not definitive. STEP 2: IDENTIFY CRITICAL OUTCOMES Please circle the above outcomes that are critical for determining whether the intervention is beneficial and whether it is harmful. Are data about critical outcomes lacking to such a degree that you would lower the preliminary strength of the recommendation? What is the resulting strength of recommendation? STEP 3: EVALUATE APPLICABILITY OF THE EVIDENCE Is the applicability of the evidence for any of the critical outcomes so low that substantially worse results are likely to be obtained in actual clinical practice? Please list the critical outcomes backed by evidence of doubtful applicability. Should the strength of recommendation be lowered because of low applicability? What is the resulting strength of recommendation? STEP 4: BALANCE BENEFITS AND HARMS Are there tradeoffs between benefits and harms that alter the strength of recommendation obtained in STEP 3? What is the resulting strength of recommendation? STEP 5 CONSIDER STRENGTH OF EVIDENCE Does the strength of the existing evidence alter the strength of recommendation obtained in STEP 4? What is the resulting strength of recommendation? NOTE: Because we are not performing a formal cost analyses, you should only consider costs if their impact is substantial. 1000 APPE NDIX VIII OPINION BASED RECOMM ENDATIONS RULES FOR MAKING OPI NION BASED RECOMMENDATIONS A guideline can contain recommendations for which there is no evidence. Work groups might make the decision to issue opinion- based recommendations. Although e xpert opini on is a form of evidence , it is also important to av oid liberal use in a guideline since research sh ows that expert opinion can be incorrect. Opinion- based recommendations are developed only if they address a vitally important aspect of patient care. For example, constructing an opinion- based recommendation in favor of taking a history and physical is warranted. Constructing an opinion- based recommendation in favor of a specific modification of a surgical technique is less commonly warranted. To ensure tha t an opinion- based recommendation is absolutely necessary, the AAOS has adopted rules to guide the content of the rationales that are based on those outlined by the U .S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF).136 Specifically, rationales based on expert opini on must: o Not contain references to or citations from articles not included in the systematic review. o Not contain the AAOS guideline language \"We Recommend\", \"We sugge st\" or \"The might.\" o Contain an explanation of the potential preventable burden of disease. This involves considering both the incidence and/or prevalence of the disease, disorder, or condition and the associated burden of suffering. To paraphrase the USPSTF, when evidence is insufficient, provision of a treatment (or diagnosti c) for a serious condition might be viewed more favorably than provision of a treatment (or diagnostic) for a condition that does not cause as much suffering. The AAOS understands that evaluating the \"burden of suffering\" is subjective and involves judgment. This evaluation should be informed by patient values and concerns. It is not appropriate for a guideline to recommend widespread use of a technology backed by little data and for which there is limited experience. Such technologies are addressed in the AAOS' Technology Overviews. o Address potential harms. o Address apparent discrepancies in the logic of different recommendations. I f there are no relevant data for several recommendations and the work group chooses to issue an opinion- based recommendation in some cases but not in other cases, the rationales must explain why. o Consider current practice. The USPSTF specifically states that clinicians justifiably fear not providing a service that is practiced on a widespread basis will lead to litigation. 136 Not providing a service that is not widely available or commonly used has less serious consequences than not providing a treatment accepted by the medical profes sion that patients expect . The patient's \"expectation of treatment\" must be tempered by the treating p hysician's guidance about the reasonable outcomes that the patient can expect. o Justify when applicable why a more costly device, drug, or procedure is being recommended. Work group members write the rationales for opinion based recommendations on the firs t day of the final work group meeting. When the work group re convenes on the second day , members approve the rationale s. If the work group cannot adopt a rationale after three votes, the rationale and the opinion- based recommendation will be withdrawn, and a \"recommendation\" stating that the group can neither recommend for or against the recommendation in question will appea r in the guideline. Sometimes work group members change their views. A t any time during the discussion of the rationale s, any member of the work group ca n make a motion to withdraw a recommendation. The guideline will state that the work group can neither recommend for or against the recommendation in question. 1001 CHECKLIST FOR VOTING ON OPINION BASED RECOMMENDATIONS When voting on the rationale, please consider the following: 1. Does the recommendation affect a substantial number of patients or address treatmen t (or diagnosis) of a condition that causes death and/or considerable suffering? 2. Does the recommendation address the potential harms that will be incurred if it is implemented and, if these harms are serious, does the recommendation justify: a. why the potential benefits outwe igh the potential harm b. why an alternative course of treatment (or diagnostic workup) that involves less serious or fewer harms is not being recommended 3. Does the rationale explain why the work group chose to make a recommendation when pr esented with minimal evidence when it might not have in other cases ? 4. Does the rationale explain that the recommendation is consistent with current practice? 5. If applicable, does the rationale justify why a less costly device, drug, or procedure is not being recommended ? VOTING BY THE NOMINAL GROUP TECHNIQUE Voting on guideline recommendations will be conducted using a modification of the nominal group technique (NGT), a method previously used in guideline development. 137 Each work g roup member ranks his or her agreement with a recommendation or performance measure on a scale of 1 to 9 (where 1 = \"extremely inappropriate\" and 9 = \"extremely appropriate\"). Consensus is obtained if the number of individuals who do not rate a measure as 7, 8, or 9 is statistically non -significant (as determined using the binomial distr ibution). Because the number of work group members who are allowed to dissent with the recommendation depends on statistical significance, the number of permissible dissenters varies with the size of the work group. The number of permissible dissenters for several work group sizes is given in the table below: Work Group Size Number of Permissible Dissenters 3 Not allowed. Statistical significance cannot be obtained 4-5 0 6-8 1 9 1 or 2 The NGT is conducted by first having members vote on a given recommendation/performance measure without discussion. If the number of dissenters is \"permissible\", the recom mendation/measure is adopted . If the number of dissenters is not permissible, then there is discussion to see if the disagreement(s) can be resolv ed. Three rounds of voting are held to attempt to resolve differences . If agreement is not reached after three voting ro unds, the recommendation is not adopted. 1002 APPENDIX IX STRUCTURED PEER REVI EW FORM Review of any AAOS confidential draft allows us to improve the overall guideline but does not imply endorsement by any given individual or any specialty society who participates in our review processes .

Review organizations are nominat ed by the work group at the introductory meeting. For this guideline, nineteen organizations were invited to review the full guideline. Fifteen societies participated in the review of the guideline on treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee and have given consent to be listed below: American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons (AAHKS) Arthroscopy Association of North America (AANA) American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine (AOSSM) American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (AAPMR) American Physical Therapy Association (APTA) Eastern Orthopaedic Association (EOA) Orthopaedic Trauma Association (OTA) Arthritis Foundation Knee Society American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) Southern Orthopaedic Association (SOA) Mid-America Orthopaedic Association Western Orthopaedic Association (WOA) Peer review comments will be available on aaos.org. Participation in the AAOS guideline peer review process does not constitute an endorsement nor does it i mply that the reviewer supports this document. 1007 APPENDIX XI INTERPRETING THE FOR EST PLOTS We use descriptive diagrams known as forest plots to present data from studies comparing the differences in outcomes between two treatment groups when a meta - analysis has been performed (combining results of multiple studies into a single estimate of overall effect). The overall effect is shown at the bottom of the graph as a diamond to illustrate the confidence intervals . The standardized mean difference or odds ratio are measures used to depict differences in outcomes between treatment groups. The horizontal line running through each point represents the 95% confidence interval for that point estimate . The solid vertical line represents \"no effect\" and i s where the standardized mean difference = 0 or odds ratio = 1.
