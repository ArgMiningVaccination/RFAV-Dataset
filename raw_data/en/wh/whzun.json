If design quality wasn't outstanding in the recent boom period, can we be optimistic about the future? In this pamphlet, CABE chief executive Richard Simmons sets out the steps that localauthorities, central government, the Homes and Communities Agency, the industry and CABE need to take to ensure that homes and neighbourhoods are of better quality. It highlights the opportunities that have been created by the recession to do things differently in the future. Embracing these opportunities can only help us to recover from troubled times better and faster.No more toxic assets Fresh thinking on housing quality Richard Simmons1Published in 2009 by the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment.

CABE 1 Kemble Street London 7070 6777 E enquiries@cabe.org.uk www.cabe.org.uk This publication is available in alternative formats on requestfrom the publisher.CABE has been warned to have low expectations about design quality when the housing market finally recovers from the recession. The warnings have come from housebuilders, professionals and public sector alike. There is also a growing consensus that the old model of housebuilders as traders may not continue to existpost-downturn. Instead new models may emerge based around longer-term investment, a stronger role for the public sector and more variety of tenure. Is this consensus right? If so, is it good news for design quality, or not? This pamphlet looks at some of the well-documented problems created by the downturn. It considers eight areas of change thatcould present opportunities for good design to emerge from the ashes of the recession: 1Local authority policymaking 2The role of regulation 3Reducing risk to developers 4Establishing location 5Investment, not trading 6Explore new development models 7Productivity and sustainable design 8Procurement and public sector market power.Summary2CABE believes there are three top priorities to ensure that design improves as we recover from the recession: 1Encourage developers to take a long-term stake in development and support them to invest in quality. 2Use the public sector's market power to insist on good design wherever public money is being invested. 3Invest in planning for good placemaking through local development frameworks, site preparation and use of non-regulatory methods to set the agenda for working together to achieve good design. CABE wants to work with its partners in local government, the Homes and Communities Agency(HCA), Communities and Local Government (CLG) and the industry to make sure that they share and act on these priorities.Summary 'CABE has been told that the major housebuilders won't be able to afford good design when the market starts to recover' \u00a9 www.thirdavenue.co.uk The downturn has seen some housebuildersstopped in their tracksIf the first casualty of war is truth, is the first casualty of recession beauty? CABE has been told that the major housebuilders won't be able to afford gooddesign when the market starts to recover; that a choice will have to be made between the quantity of homes and their quality. Professor Michael Parkinson's January 2009 report on the credit crunch and regeneration contains a devastatingly simple analysis. Toxic financial practices, originating with sub-prime mortgages in the USA, haveled to the collapse of the British financial system. This in turn has, he says, had dire consequences for theBritish development sector. 'Lenders andbuyers can't buy' 1. As we contemplate the problems of toxicity that triggered the credit crunch, we should not forget that the housing boom has bequeathed us more than a broken banking system. Along with that legacygoes another - toxic housing and an equally brokenhousebuilding industry. Much of the housing built inthe boom wasn't designed well enough to stand thetest of time; and the test has come sooner thananyone expected. Whether it is pokey little flats in over-dense developments or poor quality estates in redundantindustrial areas with no decent services, we have fartoo much of the wrong kind of housing in the wrongplace. CABE's housing audits are a litany of the worstexcesses of cheeseparing housebuilding. Overallquality is inadequate. Twenty-nine per cent of newestates in our audits were so poor that they shouldn't 4Toxicity and housing 1The credit crunch and regeneration: impact and implications , CLG, January 2009, www.tinyurl.com/bmdnkr 'Whether it is pokey little flats in over-dense developments or poor quality estates in redundant industrial areas with no decent services, we have far too much of the wrong kind of housing in the wrong place'Wrong houses, wrong place: poor design creates uninspiring placesCABE/Homes and Communities Agency7 6CABE isn't asking for anything fancy when it demands good housing and neighbourhood design. Well-made Georgian, Victorian and Edwardian terraces aren't iconic. They are decently proportioned, laid out on a plan that's easy to walk around, with parks and squares to stroll and play in. They are usually made up of standard pattern-book homes; but with reasonable room sizes, well-proportioned fronts and decent gardens. They can be reconfigured and extended in many ways. The best of them have adapted well to the car and to modern lifestyle changes. They are attractive, they work and they last. Not much to ask for in the 21st century, one might think, with an added sustainability dimension, of course.have received planning permission. Another 53 per cent had serious shortcomings 2. Floated on a land and house price bubble, this poorquality housing is going to be a huge burden now that the bubble has burst. Although the Rugg Review 3 couldn't yet assemble enough evidence conclusively to prove the damage done by shoddy buy-to-leave-emptyspeculation, we can now see an increasing number ofexamples of 'investments' that aren't, and 'homes' thatnobody wants to live in. Our built environment is the foundation asset of our economy. Its physical capital underpins our capacity to create wealth and social value. The toxicity of so much of what has been built, through what one influential commentator calls the 'build it and b****r off' business model employed by most of the major housebuilders, will leave us bearing the costs of bad design for many years to come. The physical capital that has beencreated using this model has not been a goodinvestment for anyone. Even the housebuildingcompanies themselves have suffered through notowning robust assets with long-term value. Their verysurvival is threatened by the poverty of an approach to business which makes high profits in booms but leaves them washed up in busts. Is it true that, in a highly risk averse market, the perceived costs of designing homes andneighbourhoods well might be seen as an unacceptable risk to affordability and delivery?2 Housing audit: assessing the design quality of new housing in the East Midlands, West Midlands and the SouthWest, CABE, 2007 3 The private rented sector: its contribution and potential , The centre for housing policy, October 2008, www.tinyurl.com/av54keWhat we mean by good housing and neighbourhood design The best of Georgian, Victorian and Edwardian terraces have adapted well to modern lifestyle changes \u00a9 English Heritage/National Monuments Record. Photo: James O DaviesToxicity and housingThere is a growing consensus that the downturn is leading to fundamental changes in the way the housing market and industry will work when they start to recover. Stephen Hill of C2O futureplanners and the RICS offered an interesting resum\u00e9 in an article in the Local Government Chronicle in November 20084: 'Housebuilders depend on just two things: the value of their land, and cash flow. No one knows what land is worth. Cash is not flowing. With little other fixed or intellectual capital, a household name disappearing...would be a reasonable bet. Mortgage lenders aren't lending if they can avoid it. Shared ownership is off limits with over \u00a31billion of unsold stock being converted to sub-market renting. Housing associations' current financing model is obsolete. Without cross-subsidy from sales or staircasing receipts, they now need land at nil cost and up to twice current grant levels to build for social rent. Land supply has dried up. Housebuilders are reported trying to sell land back to previous owners, including English Partnerships whose land sale-based business plan is 'under review'. Spatial plans and planning activity have little meaning or purpose in a land market vacuum. Infrastructure and affordable housing due to be delivered through current and future Section 106 agreements and the putative community infrastructure levy cannot now happen.' 9 8If CABE's housing audits show that housing design quality before the downturn wasn't outstanding, theproblem wasn't always about the homes themselves. True, some architecture was poor. Often, though, problems were down to poor estate layout, over- engineered highways, dominant parking, poor amenityspaces and lack of connectivity and local facilities. Many of CABE's design reviews add an all-too- frequent picture of small rooms, weak environmentalsustainability strategies and over-dense developments,relying too much on flats. It would not be surprising,then, if there were pessimism about design quality now the market is failing. Pre-downturn design quality Recovery and fundamental changes 4 'Breaking the cycle', Local Government Chronicle , 6 November 2009, www.tinyurl.com/ btc8pv It is not surprisingthat there is pessimism aboutdesign quality nowthat the market is failing \u00a9 Doug Norman/AlamyThere is a real risk that, as recovery begins, quality- driven customer value (including good design) will be forced even further out of the system by the cost- minimisation culture that characterised the industry before the downturn. To paraphrase what a leading industry figure said to CABE recently, 'in a recession we have to stick with what we know'. What gets cut generally tends to be what adds quality - sustainability measures, landscaping, play space, room sizes, even door and window sizes. 11All of the above are leading many (Hill included) to believe that we will not see the return of the old modelof housebuilding founded on continuously rising landvalues, relatively big and rapid returns on capital andhigh dependence on turnover and easily availablecredit. Many have argued that it should not be allowed to return and that new models should replace it. This may be inevitable but it may take time for the inevitability to hit home. The industry may be more resilient than we expect and there is more at stake than shareholders' investment. The public sector has a strong vested interest in the industry. UK housebuilding is unusual in its dependence on a small number of very big companies for so much of its output. Not only do they control most of the private sales of new properties, they now finance or build much of our affordable housing, education buildings and infrastructure. The public sector has become so interdependent on these firms that it must be difficultfor policymakers to contemplate life without them. So far, of course, the industry has responded to the shortage of credit by stopping production, reducing itsworkforce and with novel sales devices - mortgageholidays, try before you buy, part sale-part rent and soon. Others are trying to sell for rent. This is intended tosustain turnover and shift land and stock bought andbuilt at pre-downturn prices. Whether it will suffice toshore up companies with share values at rock bottomremains to be seen. 10Recovery and fundamental changes Recovery and fundamental changes Estate quality which reflects the 'build it and b****r off' business model of most of the major homebuilders \u00a9 Jon Walter/Third Avenue13Several other problems have the potential to bear on design quality: Housebuilders report that the need to fund planning agreements up front is now cripplingviability. This matters for design quality because CABE is frequently told that planning agreementssqueeze design quality out of the system at the best of times. Mortgagees are already alleged to be averse to design innovations to make homes moreenvironmentally sustainable. That isn't likely toimprove in a weak market, even though we needurgently to improve design to reduce carbon emissions. One of the biggest losses is already happening as skilled people are laid off. In the last recession many designers and planners left the business never toreturn. We paid the price in a skills shortage oncethe market picked up. Local planning authorities report a serious decline in income from planning applications 5,6. This reduces the money available to pay for all planning work,including preparing local development frameworksand design policies. 12Recovery and fundamental changes 5 The credit crunch and regeneration: impact and implications , CLG, January 2009, www.tinyurl.com/bmdnkr 6 Reduction in the number of planning applications submitted not a reason to reduce number of planners says POS, Planning Officers Society, January 2009, www.tinyurl.com/c63msdSo, can we rescue beauty from the beast that is the downturn? We certainly have some opportunities. In response to the recession, Michael Parkinson's report calls on us to 'deliver quality products in future' and to look again at placemaking and business models while the market is quiet. Much of the new thinking about how we will recover has a bearing on design quality. As usual, though, good design is not something that will simply emerge or prosper without positive action and careful nurturing. There are essential steps that must be taken to improve quality. If we get them right, they will help us to come back better and faster.Opportunities for improving quality 'In the last recession many designers and planners left the business never to return. We paid the price in a skills shortage once the market picked up'Local authorities play a big part in deciding how well- designed new places will be. Good local leadership leads to good localities. Developers coming into arecovering market have the right to be set clear expectations and to be welcomed as providers ofhomes which the community knows that it needs. Now is the time for councils to get their policies right. Their local development frameworks should be written as a prospectus setting out how they willattract high-quality development. Supplementaryplanning documents should give a sound policyfooting for good design. New homes in attractive,sustainable neighbourhoods are welcomed by existing communities. Councils should use the planning system in partnership with housebuilders, not as adversaries.They should use frameworks for constructive dialogue, such as Building for Life, to offer certainty about their approach to the design agenda. They should get a grip on their highway engineers and get rid of car-dominated estate roads. The Manual for Streets allows them to lay out beautiful streets that make walking andcycling attractive without banishing the car. It alsoallows for more efficient use of land. Using it should be the norm. 15 141Local authority policymaking Home zones give priority to pedestrianswithout banishing cars Areas which are not overlooked can lead to crime and fear of crime1Local authority policymaking\u00a9 Stephen McLaren \u00a9 Michael HardingHomes are consumer products. Reasonable regulation is needed to protect the consumer. Housebuilding, though, creates more than homes. It creates places - neighbourhoods of roads, schools, parks, shops used by the whole community, not just home buyers. Planning is how the community specifies the parts of the development which it uses. It is legitimate and essential for good design to be part of the specification. Coming out of a recession it becomes even more important to understand and protect planning's public interest role as pressure is applied to reduce regulation. 17The Home Builders Federation has made no bones about its belief that the housebuilding industry is overregulated and that the cost of regulation will havean impact on affordability in any recovery. They argue that it may depress land values to the point wherelandowners will keep property in existing uses ratherthan bring it forward for development. This isdebatable. It is an approach to value, which relies on continuing with the existing business model -a single point of sale beyond which someone else (the developer and the purchaser) profit from uplifts in value, rather than a model where participation ingrowth is accessible to a wider range of parties. Nevertheless it is obviously right to ensure thatregulation of the industry meets the five tests set by the 2005 Hampton Review 7: clearly understood (transparent) applied in the same way across the country (consistent) open to scrutiny (accessible)enforced in relation to risk (proportionate)focused on areas of greatest need (targeted). Seen in this light, improving design quality is focusedon greatest need and is proportionate, given what hasgone before. Consistency can be difficult to achieve in a locally managed, democratic system. CABEadvocates design review and Building for Life as ways of structuring dialogue about design in localdemocratic decision making, without being drawn into tick-box regulation. 162The role of regulation 7 Hampton Review , Reducing Administrative Burdens: Effective Inspection andEnforcement, 2005, HM Treasury, www.tinyurl.com/b2htdc2The role of regulation 'Homes are consumer products. Reasonable regulation is needed to protect the consumer'Councils must continue to focus on improving the quality of local services. Successful schools, clean, well-maintained streets, low crime rates, attractive parks, accessible public transport all make locations attractive to buyers. The better the location is perceived to be, the more likely that a premium for quality will be paid, even coming out of a downturn. 19The public sector is already working on ways to reduce risk to developers and lead the market out of the doldrums. Measures in use or underconsideration include: getting outline planning permissionsbuying land at existing use valuemaking compulsory purchase orders where necessary putting in robust green infrastructure and serviced sites with well laid-out streets and design codes toguide developers selling on terms that allow developers to get in at low cost, with payback to come when the market is stronger taking account of the effect of planning agreements on cash flow and spreading their cost. All this can reduce risks for developers, set out the community's expectations about quality and leaveheadroom for good design to add value. For thatheadroom to be created, of course, it has to beplanned for. The value that it creates for the community, individual buyers and developers has to be protectedthroughout the life of the project. 183Reducing risk to developers 4Establishing location A well-designed successful school can act as a focal point for a new community\u00a9David Speroreinforcing measures such as fiscal incentives or guaranteed follow-on development on public land to reward quality and willingness to take a long-term stake. 21The evidence from the old landed estates and, interestingly, some new PFI partnerships, is that those who think long term tend to invest in quality because that creates assets that last and are cheaper to maintain and run. This is an attitude which, more often than not, fosters good design. We need to encourage and offer incentives to investor-developers, not traders. The reluctance of banks to lend is forcing housebuilders to look at ways to make new models of tenure feasible. Co-ownership in various forms,build-to-let and renting rather than selling could help to drive the trend towards developers or their fundersbecoming investors. This might even give builders thechance to remedy one of their own complaints: theirinability to capitalise on growth in house prices oncethey have sold to the first buyer. This does, of course, assume growth. Long-term ownership isn't always a guarantee of quality, although it does improve the odds. Not alllanded estates are a Grosvenor. Not all landlords care for their investment. The Rugg Review found that institutional investors didn't necessarily bring to housing the same benefits that they bring ascommercial landlords. This was partly because of high overheads and partly because of the differentnature of residential covenants and the sheer volumeof individual tenancies. Yields on letting are lower than those which have traditionally been available for building for sale. So, while incentives to invest inquality should be greater for long-term investors, theymay need a helping hand. It may be necessary to find 205Investment, not trading 5Investment, not trading Footpaths that are overlooked provide safe routes for pedestrians\u00a9Design for Homes/Richard MullaneNew models of housing development are already being conceived by entrepreneurs from the private and not-for-profit sectors, eager to fill the void left by the near paralysis of the majors. Some of them have access to capital. The question for CABE and partners such as the HCA is how to support those that want to build sustainable, well-designed homesand neighbourhoods rather than those who want to continue the old ways. If we are to foster morediversity of provision and support new entrants to the market we will need to be generous with ouradvice and help to create opportunities throughprocurement briefs which encourage innovation. 226Explore new development models Groups of prospective residents commissioned their own homes in T\u00fcbingen-S\u00fcdstadt, near Stuttgart, arranged in blocks surrounding semi-private courtyardswhere children's play is informally supervised by overlooking apartments\u00a9 Christian Junge'The question is how we support those that want to build sustainable,well-designed homes andneighbourhoods ratherthan those who want tocontinue the old ways'25 24The role of the public sector in funding and procurement is crucial. Local authorities can now build homes and finance them more freely. The HCA has a statutory duty to deliver high-quality, well-designed, sustainable homes. Councils have a duty to act in the best interests of their community and local planning authorities have been given a statutory duty to require good, sustainable design. Building for Life has been introduced as a measure of the quality of new homes in local authority performance indicators. Both the HCA and local government should use their market power to insist that nothing poor is built with public money or on publicly owned land. When it comes to spending public money, insisting on good standards isn't about regulation. It's about avoiding waste and insisting that taxpayers get good value for their taxes. Registered social landlords can play their part in this as well, setting clear briefs for good quality homes and neighbourhoods. There should be a quid pro quo for the private sector. Bidding costs were often immense before the downturn and public procurement was long and complex. It doesn't have to be like this. One housebuilder with a good track record on design describes a recent 'beauty parade' (his words) in which his company was selected as a development partner based on its track record of good design, willingness to open its books and an approach to risk sharing which allowed the public and private sectors to achieve fair returns over time. Partnership must be one of the keys to getting good value (including good, sustainable design) out of public assets. We won't make a success of getting out of the recession if we don't collaborate.8 Procurement and public sector market power We will need the industry to increase its productivity substantially to make up for the production lost ordelayed in the downturn. As it also has to address theobligation to build low or zero carbon homes by 2016, this seems like a good time for it to be reviewing itsproduct ranges and moving to production methodsand materials that are faster to market and moresustainable. That creates a good opportunity to look at architecture and urban design as well. Built environment carbon and methane emissions come from outside the home as well as within. Pushing developers beyond affordable levels of theCode for Sustainable Homes may produce diminishingreturns. CABE argues that it is better to adopt an energy standard such as Passivhaus plus, which concentrates on reducing energy consumption. We should then invest in off-site renewables and improved public transport. CABE supports the government's decision to take a hierarchical approach to the definition of low and zero carbon homes which focuses on reducing energyconsumption before more costly approaches such as off-site renewables. Places designed to reduce all their carbon and methane emissions and with robust greeninfrastructure must be the post-recession norm.7 Productivity and sustainable design27 26CABE is working with local authorities, the Planning Inspectorate, the HCA through ATLAS, the Planning Advisory Service and government offices to help to develop clear, deliverable LDF core strategies and design policies which give certainty to developers about what is required to meet local aspirations and get quick planning permissions. CABE is promoting non-regulatory approaches to dialogue about design in the planning and highways system and public procurement, such as Building for Life and the Manual for Streets . Building for Life is being adopted by an increasing number of local planning authorities as a negotiating and performance measurement tool. Research into the value of good design and quality standards. CABE is planning research on the role of design quality in maintaining value during a recession, and the lessons for creating viable housing in the future. It is also developing work on new models for delivering homes and places. CABE has just launched the 'Sustainable Cities' website www.sustainablecities.org.uk to support local authorities in practicing sustainable urban design and management, in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt cities to climate change. An associated programme of learning for Core Cities is also planned.What is CABE doing? CABE is an advisory body. It has to work with those who plan, procure and build housing if design qualityis to be improved. CABE's methods for encouraginggood housing and neighbourhood design as we aimfor recovery include: Design review for major projects. Design review exists to support local decision makers anddevelopers. It's free at the point of delivery. It works best early in the planning process but it is always a good way to avoid regulatoryentanglements and speed up the process. \u00a9 Design for Homes/Richard MullaneWell designed, energy efficient homes situated in attractive places, withaccess to green space,public transport andother amenities must become the post- recession normWhat is CABE doing?28CABE believes that there are three top priorities to ensure that design improves as we recover from the recession: 1Encourage developers to take a long-term stake in development and support them to invest in quality. 2Use the public sector's market power to insist on good design wherever public money is being invested. 3Invest in planning for good placemaking through local development frameworks, site preparation and use of non-regulatory methods to set the agenda fora non-adversarial approach to getting good design. CABE wants to work with its partners in local government, the HCA, CLG and the industry to make sure that these priorities are shared and acted on. The recession is deep and profound. Recovery will not beeasy. We must resist the temptation to despair. We can learn from the last few years. We must stand up to those who would add more toxic assets to our builtenvironment. We can do better. From so many endings we can create new beginnings. Now is the time to setour sights on building homes and neighbourhoodswhich are efficient, sustainable and beautiful. If wemake that our goal and stick to it, we can do more than recover. We can excel. 'We must stand up to those who would add more toxic assets to our built environment.
