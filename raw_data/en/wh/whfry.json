They take medical histories, perform physical examinations, conduct diagnostic tests, recommend and provide treatment, and advise patients on their overall health and well-being. While there are several different types of physicians, they can usually be divided into three broad categories: \"Primary care physicians are the doctors patients usually visit most frequently. They treat a wide range of illnesses and regularly provide preventive care, and they also enjoy long-term relationships with their patients. Pediatricians, family practitioners, and general internists are primary care physicians. \"Surgeons perform operations to treat diseases and repair injuries. \"Specialists have expertise related to specific diseases, age groups, and bodily organs. Cardiologists, psychiatrists, geriatricians, and ophthalmologists are examples of specialists.\" For further information about allopathic medicine, visit the [American Medical Association](http://www.ama-assn.org/) and the [Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC)](http://aamc.org/).
