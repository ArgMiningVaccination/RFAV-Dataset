Meghan Burke has been a member of the Georgia Naturopathic Medical Association since 1993. She graduated from the University in 1989 with a B.A in psychology. It was on a UGA study abroad trip in France where she first became interested in herbs and medicine. Unlike allopathic medicine, which is what most of us consider \"mainstream medicine,\" naturopathic medicine takes a holistic approach to healing \u2014 taking the entire body and external factors into account. \"Allopathic medicine is quite fragmented,\" Burke said. Instead of isolating the problem area, an naturopathic practitioner will take everything into account, even diet and one's family life. There are several practices under the umbrella of naturopathic medicine. \"Anything natural is naturopathic medicine,\" Burke said. One of the most accessible practices is nutritional herbalism, which involves utilizing plants as medicine. Salina Nelson manages Remedy, an herb shop in Athens, and will shock you with her knowledge of herbs. For almost any ailment, she is convinced there is an herb that will make it easier to deal with. Both Burke and Nelson stressed more than once that mainstream medications often force your body into stopping the symptoms. They recommend herbal alternatives because they support your body's organic complex and help it through the process that is taking place, not just cover it up. Herb user June Turnell considers herself living proof of how herbalism can be effectively used as a supplement to a health regimen, even when the doctors are stumped. In 1973, Turnell began having a persistent and violent rash that would break out all over her body. Turnell went to her general practitioner, a pulmonary doctor and a dermatologist. She said all three physicians told her that it was a bacterial infection, and the rash was her body trying to throw off the toxin. \"But none of them knew what to do about it,\" Turnell said. As time passed, the rash became worse and more frequent. When Turnell was 65, her husband suggested they go see Meghan Burke at the Healing Arts Centre. Burke performed an iridology exam, an eye exam that tells practitioners details of a person's health, and told June that she was full of toxins and bacteria. \"Same story, but here is the difference \u2014 she gave me a colon cleanser and the rash went away,\" Turnell said. Turnell is now 78 years old and takes herbal supplements for her joints and circulation. \"Herbal supplements work with your body to heal, and that's why I take them.\" Turnell said. Low Iron \"If I go to the doctor and I find out my iron is low, I can go to the grocery store and find a wide selection of foods that are going to provide me with iron,\" Burke said. Anything with leafy greens is a good source of iron, and the darker the green, the more iron. Before grocery stores, the same concept applied. Believe it our not, dandelion greens are an excellent source of iron. \"Every plant contains nutrients,\" Burke said. \"Since most of us do not have time to graze,\" Burke said, \"there are herbal shops that will sell you encapsulated dandelion and other herbs.\" Lack of Focus It seems like everybody and their neighbor is taking medications for ADHD, but these medications are very harsh and the side effects can be worse than the original attention issue. Nelson said there are an array of herbal combinations to combat lack of focus. \"We see lots of kids receiving benefits once they start the Omega 3 fatty acids and one of the other products we have,\" Burke said. Two of the other possible products are called Calm Child and Focus Attention. Hangovers After a night downtown, the next morning can be pretty rough. But, there are some natural herbs, such as ginger and hops, that can ease the pain and one that can even help prevent it. According to Nelson, B vitamin will can help ease wrath of hangovers. Kudzu root also helps with hangovers and it is highly nutritive and can even decrease one's desire to drink. \"There was actually a study done with frat boys. They had them watching a football game and coolers of beers next to them, and those who took the kudzu root didn't want to drink,\" Neslon said. Kudzu is a plant that we see a lot growing along highways; but, you shouldn't harvest any there! Menstrual Cramps To help alleviate the monthly symptoms that plague women such as cramps, bloating and irritability, Neson suggested the herbs black cohosh, cramp bark, and plantain leaves. There are also several products with various herbal combinations that may help with pms symptoms, some of these are called Monthly Maintenance and Female comfort. Weak Immune System Around finals, midterms and freezing temperatures no one can chug enough orange juice to ensure their immune system will be strong enough to carry them through. These foods and supplements can help hedge your bets and put the tissues away. According to Burke, garlic is excellent for strengthening the immune system. Other herbal supplements that can encourage your body's immune system to be stronger are Golden Seal, rose hips, chamomile, peppermint, reishi, olive leaf extract and thyme. \"Thyme also has very strong antibacterial properties,\" Nelson said.
