The first acknowledged mention of apothecaries was in the Old Testament of the Bible. In the Bible it states that, \" and thou shalt make it an oil of holy ointment, an ointment compound after the art of the apothecary: it shall be an holy anointing oil.\" Exodus 30:35. Even before CE (common era), apothecaries were an important part of early society. The practice of making organic medicine from herbs was also present during the Roman empire. Since the Renaissance took a lot of inspiration from old Rome, they carried on the Roman traditions of medicine made of natural ingredients. During the Renaissance, students who wanted to enter the field of apothecary would be trained as apprentices. This meant that they would be learning from a skilled employer, earning low wages for a certain amount of time. In the 1500's, the art of the apothecary was starting to be taught in universities as \"Use of herbs as medicines dates back to the beginning of civilized man.

I sure have. Within the last couple decades, there has been an increased study in the science of aromatherapy. Aromatherapy, as defined by NAHA (Source 6), is \"the art and science of utilizing naturally extracted aromatic essences from plants to balance, harmonize and promote the health of body, mind and spirit\". And one of the main products that this movement has taken shape through is Bath Bombs. A Bath Bomb, as defined by the Collins dictionary, is a ball of carbonates and scent that is placed in bath water to dissolve and impart supposedly therapeutic properties to the water. It has been proven by many studies the affects that bath bombs and other forms of aromatherapy have had on peoples' mental and physical health. In the late 1930s, a Aromatherapy can be used to treat many problems such as nausea, body aches, anxiety, depression, fatigue, headaches, labour pain and hormonal problems (Lane et al., 2011; Medicalnewstoday.com, 2018). Aromatherapy can be used in addition to other medicine practises including those performed by allied health professionals, or on its own (Medicalnewstoday.com, 2018). For example, a study conducted by (Olapour et al., 2013) has found that aromatherapy can provide pain relief to women who have recently had a The sense of smell is a powerful tool that humans have at their disposal. It can have an impact on one's psychological system. When smell enters the scene receptors in the nose, the signal is sent to the olfactory cortex and some parts of the limbic system. The limbic system is responsible for emotions, so it is possible that the sense of smell can have an impact on one's mental make-up. Aromatherapy can be used to treat patients with depression and anxiety using odors. However, studies involving aromatherapy are limited and these claims are not fully solidified. A study to see if aromatherapy is effective in treating depression would be a case study. Case studies provide more information over a longer period, which will allow for the patient Aromatherapy, as defined by Wikipedia, is \"a form of alternative medicine that uses volatile plant materials, known as Herbal medicine has been traced back to Neanderthal time by researchers finding plant micro fossils in dental area of skeletons found in that time period.

Chronic Aromatherapy is used as an alternative medicine which consists of essential oils extracted from a wide variety of components such as: trees, shrubs, grasses, herbs and flowers. Each component is stored in a specialised oil and on average an essential oil contains one hundred components including alcohols, ketones and aldehydes (Worwood, 1991). Essences are also used in general medicine they are used as flavouring agents and therapeutic ingredients, they are used in a number of medication including antiseptic creams and ointments. Aromatherapy aims to improve an individual's health or mood through non-invasive and non-toxic treatment/therapies. The evaporation of essences from the components surface is known to be a defence mechanism against infection by bacteria and fungi which contribute towards stimulating the body's own natural healing mechanisms. There are a combination of aromas which include: massage, aromatic baths and other treatments that all work to regulate, balance and heal (Tisserand, 1977). In this essay, I will determine how and to what extent aromatherapy should be tested to see its scientific validity. Science is ever changing, hypothesis built on top on ranging hypotheses, theory after theory continually being ratified and disproved, never-ending ideas of experiments, case studies, and surveys; these all furthering of human understanding of this world. Mainstream science can also often be classified as pseudoscience because it has hence been disproven, but not to the extent where the general public accepts or even realizes its apocryphalness. Aromatherapy is partially under this category because there is no definitive research proving either way because of the challenges in research, but in order to be determined scientifically The Benefits and Types Of Aromatherapy Diffusers Relaxing the senses is the job of an aromatherapy diffuser.

Without those important components, the oil loses the respect to be essential. Essential oils are natural oils acquired by distillation. The practice of steam distillation has been used throughout ancient times, where steam gets injected throughout the plant material while the steam and oils are There are multiple ways to apply essential oils in aromatherapy one way is adding essential oil to your bath where it can be absorbed in through your skin. Another way is soaking a washcloth in some warm water that has a few drops of essential only and applying that to your body. Two common techniques are either steam inhalation where you inhale the vapor of the essential oil through a vapor machine or aroma massage therapy where the essential oil is added to the lotion and then the essential oil is absorbed through the skin by the lotion (The Balance & Harmony of Body and Mind).
