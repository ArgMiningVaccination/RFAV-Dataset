Braker Ln. Austin, TX 787 53 1 ATTACHMENT 1 - PROJECT NARRATIVE ASPIRE AT BIG AUSTIN Located on 6.9 acres zoned for multifamily, Aspire at Big Austin will be a 360-unit, Class-A, mixed income multifamily community for individuals and families. This high-end workforce housing community will offer residents an affordable, attractive, comfortable, and engaging living experience designed to enhance quality of life through activity, interaction, wellness, and convenience. Apire/BIG Austin is proposed to be a partnership with Austin Housing Finance Corporation. With this in mind, we ask that this funding request for acquisition and pre-development funding be a priority for any remaining funds in the RHDA program. If enough funds are not available to fund the full request, we ask that the $300,000 in pre-development funding be awarded to allow this project to move forward in earnest on architectural and engineering to advance the permitting process. If a portion of funds are available, we ask that RHDA staff reach out to discuss potential ways to utilize the funds available now and bridge the remaining funds until the RDHA pot is replenished and funds are available. As home values continue to rise and home-ownership becomes more expensive to moderate and low- income earners, the proposed development provides residents an attractive opportunity to obtain high- quality housing at an approachable price, helping to alleviate the affordability crisis in the Austin market. As a mixed-income community, the development proposed will offer affordable units to qualifying households as well as some market units. Affordable units will be rent and income restricted, and on average will be for households earning 60% of the Area Median Income (AMI). A mix of spacious studio, one-, two-, and three-bedroom floor plans will give residents the option to choose the unit type that best fits their individual lifestyle and preferences. With copious amenities, high-end interiors, easy access to Interstate 35, and just minutes from downtown, Aspire at Big Austin is well-positioned to become one of the premiere mixed-income residential communities in North Austin. The total development cost for Aspire at Big Austin is $84M. It is anticipated that the financing structure will include a construction to permanent FHA insured 221(d)(4) mortgage. This structure anticipates the issuance of bonds which will be outstanding during the construction period and which will be collateralized by a portion of the FHA mortgage. The anticipated bond collateral fund will generate bond reinvestment proceeds that will partially offset the bond interest incurred during construction, and which is shown as a source. A bridge loan will also be necessary during construction. The remaining sources will be tax credit equity, a City of Austin RHDA request and deferred developer fee. Aspire at Big Austin will include a menu of resident-informed supportive services provided by a third party provider. Services provided on similar Mission DG properties include: Basic Adult Education/GED Preparation/English as a Second Language Legal Assistance and Crisis Intervention Case Management Career Placement & Training Health Screening Services/Health and Nutritional Courses After School Programs/Scholastic Tutoring 2 Social Events and Recreation Community Safety, Self-Esteem and Problem Solving Income Tax Seminars or Preparation Transportation Mission Development Group, LLC (Mission DG) is a real estate development specializing in mixed-use, age-restricted, historic, affordable, garden-style and urban infill projects.

Apart from challenges related to the declining state of the original buildings, the project's proximity to Mission Concepci\u00f3n presented numerous obstacles. Mission DG worked closely with Moule & Polyzoides to create a concept design compatible with the competing architectural styles of the Mission and the seminary. Also, the proposed plan underwent many revisions to ensure the development abided b y all overlay and viewshed requirements to certify the project would not interfere, but rather enhance, the World Heritage nomination. Sustainable features incorporated into the project's design include: water conserving plumbing fixtures; energy efficient appliances, fixtures, and windows; drip irrigation in planters; low VOC finish materials; native trees and plants to reduce irrigation consumption; and compact fluorescent and LED light fixtures.

Sustainable features incorporated into the project's design include: water conserving plumbing fixtures; energy efficient appliances, fixtures, and windows; drip irrigation in planters; low VOC finish materials; native trees and plants to reduce irrigation consumption; and compact fluorescent and LED light fixtures.

The project took approximately 26 months from planning through construction, and was completed in 2016. COSTS & FINANCING Since Brooks Development Authority (BDA) is a local government entity, Mission DG had to create an incentive financing structure to allow BDA to own the project while the development team guaranteed the project. Inter National Bank (INB) presented the best financing option out of the five debt term sheets presented. INB funded $21 million of the constru ction loan, while Brevet Capital, an EB-5 bridge lender out of New York, funded $5 million; and BDA's land subordinated to INB accounted for the final equity piece. The project received impact and fee waivers through the City of San Antonio's ICRIP program . In November 2016, after the successful build and stabilization of the project, Mission DG sold its ownership interests to an existing property management company/investment partner. The project was structured as a Public -Private Partnership with BDA, in which BDA contributed the land to the partnership.

The existing metal roof was retained and the interior ceiling was exposed to take advantage of the building's high ceilings and celebrate the existing steel truss structure. White, metal ceiling panels were installed to enhance the industrial and utilitarian aesthetic.

Apart from challenges related to the declining state of the original buildings, the project's proximity to Mission Concepci\u00f3n presented numerous obstacles. Mission DG worked closely with Moule & Polyzoides to create a concept design compatible with the competing architectural styles of the Mission and the seminary. Also, the proposed plan underwent many revisions to ensure the development abided b y all overlay and viewshed requirements to certify the project would not interfere, but rather enhance, the World Heritage nomination. Sustainable features incorporated into the project's design include: water conserving plumbing fixtures; energy efficient appliances, fixtures, and windows; drip irrigation in planters; low VOC finish materials; native trees and plants to reduce irrigation consumption; and compact fluorescent and LED light fixtures.

The project took approximately 26 months from planning through construction, and was completed in 2016. COSTS & FINANCING Since Brooks Development Authority (BDA) is a local government entity, Mission DG had to create an incentive financing structure to allow BDA to own the project while the development team guaranteed the project. Inter National Bank (INB) presented the best financing option out of the five debt term sheets presented. INB funded $21 million of the constru ction loan, while Brevet Capital, an EB-5 bridge lender out of New York, funded $5 million; and BDA's land subordinated to INB accounted for the final equity piece. The project received impact and fee waivers through the City of San Antonio's ICRIP program . In November 2016, after the successful build and stabilization of the project, Mission DG sold its ownership interests to an existing property management company/investment partner. The project was structured as a Public -Private Partnership with BDA, in which BDA contributed the land to the partnership.

List of exhibits as identified in Mortgagee Letter 2014-05, Standardized Multifamily FHA Mortgage Insurance Applications . 12. Multifamily Housing completes environmental reviews in the HUD Environmental Online System (HEROS). HEROS offers a consistent approach to environmental reviews and more clearly states what is required for environmental compliance. MF Partners gained direct access to HEROS from May to October 2018. In order to avoid delays in processing and allow Multifamily Production staff to meet processing timeframes HUD expects you or your third-party environmental engineer to enter documentation directly into HEROS. HUD staff will independently evaluate the work and prepare the environmental reviews (i.e. supplement, correct and append, as needed). Certain aspects of the review, such as contacting tribal entities for consultation, must be completed by HUD. In summary, HUD staff is still the preparer and legally responsible for environmental determinations.
