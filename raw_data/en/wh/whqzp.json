FDA Statement Some drugs or medical devices demonstrated at the Annual Meeting have been cleared by the FDA for specific purposes only or have not been cleared by the FDA. The FDA has stated that it is the responsibility of the physician to determine the FDA clearance status of each drug or medical device he or she wishes to use in clinical practice. Academy policy provides that \"off label\" uses of a drug or medical device may be described in the Academy's CME activities so long as the \"off label\" use of the drug or medical device is also specifically disclosed (i.e. it must be disclosed that the FDA has not cleared the drug or device for the described purpose). Any drug or medical device is being used \"off label\" if the described use is not set forth on the product's current label. Reproduction The Academy reserves any and all of its rights to materials presented at the Annual Meeting, including Posters. Reproductions of any kind, by any person or entity, without prior written permission from the Academy, are strictly prohibited. Prohibited reproductions include, but are not limited to, audiotapes, videotapes, and/or still photography. Persons violating this policy may have their badge confiscated and be escorted from the meeting. No unapproved surveys, handouts, or literature may be distributed at the meeting. Presentation of Fraudulent Research The Central Program Committee makes every attempt to ensure that the research activities and findings presented in the scientific program are genuine and valid. It should be understood, however, that it is not possible to vet each and every study that is presented during the Annual Meeting. The abstracts of presentations submitted for grading are rated by qualified and expert graders. In some instances, the paper presentation or poster may not reflect its related abstract submitted six months earlier. The Central Program Committee considers these instances to be errors in the presenters' judgment when they occur. Presentation of fraudulent research violates the AAOS Mandatory Standards of Professionalism on Research and Academic Responsibilities. If you feel you have witnessed a knowingly fraudulent presentation, please address your concern to a member of the Central Program Committee or Academy staff. The Central Program Committee will review the matter and may determine the response, if any is needed. AAOS reserves the right to bar the submission of future abstracts from the speaker(s) and/or to publish a retraction of the abstract in AAOS Now or other AAOS publications or communications. Any AAOS member may also file a grievance against another AAOS member under the AAOS Professional Compliance Program. Based upon the recommendation of the Committee on Professionalism and the Judiciary Committee, the AAOS Board of Directors may determine to issue a letter of concern, or to reprimand, censure, suspend, or expel the AAOS Fellow or Member who presented the fraudulent research. For more information on the Professional Compliance Program, visit aaos.org/profcomp or email professionalcompliance@aaos.org.ANNUAL MEETING A TO ZAnnual Meeting A to Z Attendee Policies ADA Request AAOS will consider the requests of persons with disabilities for reasonable modifications of policies, practices and procedures or for auxiliary aids and services where necessary to provide access to AAOS facilities, events, services and products.

SYMPOSIUM R 1:30 PM - 3:00 PM Ballroom 6D Clinical Decision Making for Cervical Disorders in Young Patients: Management of Multi-Level Disk Herniations in the Young Adult Moderator: Michael C. Gerling, MD, FAAOS CSRS Anterior techniques for decompression and stabilization of the cervical spine are widely used and accepted in the paradigm of treatment for cervical disk disorders. Though the traditional technique incorporates fusion for stabilization of the motion segments, adjacent segment disease and hardware complications are prevalent and especially concerning in the younger population. Disk replacement, also termed disk arthroplasty, has enjoyed recent popularity with similar outcomes and lower reoperation rates in Level 1 clinical trials. This symposium will explore clinical decision making when faced with challenging multi-level cervical disk disorders in young and middle aged patients. Case based discussion will focus on indications, complications, technique pearls and variations from experts in the field from the Cervical Spine Research Society. I.

The MIB showed better improvement in range of motion from the early postoperative period than the ACR. However, pain was still experienced in the MIB group during the early postoperative period compared with the ACR group. There are various reports on the merits and demerits of both procedures. MIB has the demerit of requiring greater skill to administer, but it has the merit of not having any of the complications associated with general anesthesia and hospitalization, unlike ACR. Thus, the first-choice treatment for FS should be MIB. However, if pain persists after MIB, then ACR should be performed.
