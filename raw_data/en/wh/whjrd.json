T he proposed rule outlined our propose d policies th at were intended to m ove the health car e ecosystem in the direction of interoperability, and to signal our commitment to the vision set out in the 21st Century Cures Act and Executive Order 13813 to improve quality and accessibility of informati on that Am ericans need to make in formed health care decisions, includi ng data abou t health care prices and outcomes, while minimizing reporti ng burdens on affected health care provi ders and pa ye rs. W e solicited p ublic comments on the CMS Interoperability a n d P atient Access proposed rule . In this final rule, we address those public comments and outline our final policies in the re spec tive sections of this r ule. A. P urpose This fin al rule is the firs t pha se of policies c entrally foc used o n adva ncing interoperability a nd patie nt access to health information using the aut hority a va ilable to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid S ervices (CMS). We believe this is an important st ep in advanci ng interoperability, putting patients at the ce nter of their health care, and ensuring they ha ve access to the ir health inf or mation. We are committed to working with sta keholders to s olve the issue of interoperability and ge t ting pa tients access to information about the ir health care, and we are taking an act ive approach t o move participants in the health care market toward interoperability a nd the se cure and timely exchange of hea lth informati on by adopti ng policies for the Medicar e and Medicaid programs, the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and qualified he a lth p la n (Q H P) issuers on the indivi dual marke t Federally- facilitated Exchanges (FFEs) . For purposes of this rule, references to Q H P issue rs on t he FFEs exclude s issuers offering only stand-alone dental plans (SADPs), unless otherwise noted f or a specific proposed CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 7 or finalized policy . Likewise, we are also excluding QHP issuers only offering QHPs in the Federally -facilitated Small Business Health Options Program Exchanges (FF-SHOP s) from the provisions of this rule and so, for purposes of this rule references to QHP issuers on the FFEs excludes issuers offering QHPs only on the FF- SHOPs . We note that, in this final rule, FFEs include FFEs in states that perform plan managem ent functions. State -Based Exchanges on the Federal Platform (SBE -FPs) are not FFEs, even though consumers in these states enroll in coverage through HealthCare.gov, and QHP issuers in SBE- FPs are not subject to the requirements in this rule. B. Overview We are dedicated to enhancing and protecting the health and well-being of all Americans. One critical issue in the U.S. health care system is that people cannot easily access their health information in interoperable forms. Patients and the health care providers caring for them are often presented with an incomplete picture of their health and care as pieces of their information are stored in various, unconnected systems and do not accompany the patient to every care setting. Although more than 95 percent of hospitals 1 and 75 percent of office- based clinicians2 are utilizing certified health IT, challenges remain in creating a comprehensive, longitudinal view of a patient's health history. 3, 4, 5 This siloed nature of health care data prevents physicians, 1 Office of the National Coordinator.

CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 8 pharmaceutical co mpanies, m anufacturers, and p aye rs from accessing and interpreting important data sets, instead, encouraging each group to make decisions based upon a part of the informati on rather than the whol e. Without an enforced standard of interoperability, dat a exchanges are often complicated a nd time-consuming. W e believe patients should have the ability t o move from payer to payer, provider to provider, and ha ve both their clinical a nd adm inistrative information travel with th em throu ghout their j ourney. Whe n a patient receives care from a new provider, a record of the ir he alth information should be rea dily a vailable to that care pr ovider, re ga rdless o f where or by w hom care was previously provided. Whe n a patient is d ischarged f rom a hos pital to a post-acute care (PAC) setting there should be no question as to how, when, or where their data will be exchanged. Likewise, w hen an enrollee chang es payers or ages into M edi care, the enrollee should be able to have their claims history and en counter data fol low so tha t information is not lost. A s discussed in mo re de tail in section III. of t his fin al rule, c la ims a nd encounter data c an offer a mo re hol istic und e rstanding of a pa t ient's health, provi ding insights int o ev erything from the frequency and types of care provided and for what reason, medicati on histor y and adherence, and the evolution and ad he renc e to a care plan. T his information can e mpower pa tients to m ake better decisions and inform providers to support better health outcomes. For providers in clinical and community settings, health information technology (health I T) should be a resource, enabling providers to deliver high quality care , creating efficiencies and a llowing them to a c cess all payer and pr ovider data fo r their patients . Therefore, health IT should not detrac t from the c linician-patient relationship, from the patie nt's e xp erience o f care, or fro m the quality of work life for physicians, nurses, other health care professionals, and social service CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 9 providers. Through standards-base d interoperability a nd information exchange, healt h IT has the pot entia l to fa cilitate e fficient, safe, h igh-qualit y care fo r individuals and populations. All payers should have the ability to exchange dat a seamlessly with other payers for timely be nefits coordination or transitions, and with health care and social service providers to facilitate more coordinated and ef ficient ca re. Payers are in a unique position to provide enrollees w ith a c om pr ehensive pi cture o f their claims and enc ounter data, a llowing pa tie nts to pi ece together their own information that might otherwise be lost in disparate systems. This information can c ont ribute to be tter informed d ecision making, helping to inf or m the patient's choi ce of co verage options and care providers t o more ef fectively manage their own healt h, care, a nd costs. We are committed to working with stakeholders to solve the issue of interoperability and patient access in the U.S. healt h care system whi le reducing administrative burdens on providers and are taking an active approach using all available policy levers and authorities to move participant s in the health care market toward i n teroperability a nd the secure and timely exc hange of health care information. C. Executive Order and MyHealthEData On Oc t obe r 12, 2017, President Trump issued Executive Order 13813 to Promote Healthcare Choice a nd Competition Ac ross the United S ta tes. S ection 1(c)(iii) of Executive O rder 13813 states that the Administration will improve access to, and the quality of, informat ion that Am ericans need to make in formed health care decisions, includi ng information a bout health care prices and outcomes, while minimizing reporting burdens on impacted providers, and payers, meaning providers and payers subject to this rule. CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 10 In support of Executive Order 13813, the Administration launched the MyHealthEData i nitiative. This government-wide initiative aims to empower patients by ensuring that they have access to their own health information and the ability to decide how their data will b e used, while keeping that information safe and secure. MyHealthEData aims to break down the barriers that prevent patients from gaining electronic access to their health information from the device or application of their choice, empowering patients and t aking a critical step toward interoperability and patient data exchange. In March 2018, the White House Office of American Innovation and the CMS Administrator announced the launch of MyHealthEData, and CMS's direct, hands- on role in improving patient acc ess and advancing interoperability. As part of the MyHealthEData initiative, we are taking a patient -centered approach to health information access and moving to a system in which patients have immediate access to their computable health information such t hat they can be assured that their health information will follow them as they move throughout the health care system from provider to provider, payer to payer. To accomplish this, we have launched several initiatives related to data sharing and interoperability to empower patients and encourage payer and provider competition. We continue to advance the policies and goals of the MyHealthEData initiative through various provisions included in this final rule. As finalized in this rule, our policies are wide -reaching and will have an impact on all facets of the health care system. Several key touch points of the policies in this rule include: Patients : Enabling patients to access their health information electronically without special effort by r equiring the paye r s subject to th is fin al rule to ma ke data available through an application programming int e rface ( API) to w hi ch third-party software applications connect to make data available to patients for their personal use. This encourages patients to take charge of CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 11 and better manage their health care, and thus these initiatives are imperative to improving a patient's long -term health outcomes. Clinicians and Hospitals : Ensuring that health care providers have ready access to health information a bout their patients, regardless of where the patient may have previously received care. We are also implementing policies to prevent health care providers from inappropriately restricting the flow of information to other health care providers and payers. Finally, we are working to ensure that better interoperability reduces the burden on health care providers. Payers: Implementing requirements to ensure that payers (that is, entities and organizations that pay for health care), such as payers in Medicare Advantage, Medicaid, and CHIP, make enrollee electronic health information held by the payer available through an API such that, with use of software expected to be developed by payers and third parties, the information becomes easily accessible to the enrollee and data flow seamlessly with the enrollee as such en rollees change health care and social service providers and payers. Additionally, our policies ensure that payers make it easy f or current and prospective enro llees to identify which providers are within a given plan's network in a way that is simple and easy for enrollees to access and understand, and thus find the providers that are right for them. As a result of our efforts to standardize data and technical approaches to advance interoperability, we believe health care provider s and their patients, as well as other key participants within the health care ecosystem such as payers, will have appropriate access to the information necessary to coordinate individual care; analyze population health trends, outcomes, and costs; and manage benefits and the health of populations, while tracking progress through quality improvement initiatives. We are working with other federal partners including the Office 12 CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 of the National Coordinator for Health Inf o rmation Technology (ONC) on this effort with the clear objectives of improving patient access and care, alleviating provider burden, a nd reducing over all he alth car e costs, al l while taking steps to protect the privacy and security of patients' pe rsonal h ealth information. As evidence of this p artnership, O NC is re leasing th e ONC 21st Century C ures A ct fina l rul e (published elsewhe re in t his issue of the Federal Regis ter) i n tandem with thi s final rule. I t is this coordinated federal effort, in c onjunction with strong suppor t and innovation from our s ta keholders , that will he lp us move ever closer to true interoperability. D. Past Efforts The De partment of Health and Human Services (HHS) has been working to advance the interoperability of electronic health informati on for over 15 years. For a det ailed explanation of past efforts , see the CMS Int eroperability and Patient Access proposed rule (84 FR 7612 through 7614). E. Challenges a ck, we that there ar e many barriers to interoperability, which have obstructed progress over the years. We have conducted stakeholder meetings and roundtables; sol icited c omments via RFIs; and received add itional f eedback through letters and rulemaking. All of this input together contributed t o the policies in our Interoperabilit y and Patient Acc ess proposed rule, and when combined with the comments we received on the proposed rule , the content of this final rule. Some of the main barriers sha red with us, specifically patient identificati on, lack of standardizati on, i nformation blocking, the lack of adopti on a nd use of certified health IT among post- acute care (PAC) p r oviders, privacy concerns, and uncertainty about the requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 13 Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) Privacy, Security, and Breach Notification Rules, were discussed in the proposed rule (84 FR 7614 through 7617). While we have made efforts to address some of these barriers in this final rule and through prior rules and actions, we believe there is still considerable work to be done to overcome some of these challenges toward achieving interoperability, and we will continue this work as we move forward with our interoperability efforts. F.Summary of Major Provisions This fin al rule e mpowers pa tie nts i n MA orga nizations, Medicaid and CHIP FFS programs, Medicaid m anaged ca re plans, C HIP m anaged c are entities, a nd QHP issuers on t he FFEs, by fina liz ing se veral initiatives tha t will break d own t hose barriers currently keeping patients f rom easily a ccessing their electronic h ealth care information. Additionally, the rule creates and implements new m echa nism s to ena ble patients to access their ow n health care information thr ough t hird-party softw a re applications, thereby providi ng them wi th the ability to de cide how, when, and with whom to share th eir information. We are finalizing with modifications our proposal to require MA organizations, Medicaid and CHIP FFS programs, Medicai d managed care plans , CHIP m anaged c are entities, and QHP issuers on the FFEs to i mplement and maintain a sta ndards -based P atient A ccess API. T his Patient A ccess API m ust meet the technical standards f inalized by HHS in the ONC 21st Century Cures A ct final rule (published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Re gister ) at 45 CFR 170.215 (currently R elease 4.0.1) and the content and vocabulary standards finalize d by H HS in the ONC 21s t Century Cures Act final rule (published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Regist er) at 45 CFR 170.213, as well as content and vocabulary standards at 45 CFR part 162 and the content CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 14 and vocabulary standards at 42 CFR 423.160. W e are finalizing that through the Patient Access API, payers mus t perm it third -party applications to retrieve, with the approval and at the direction of a current enrollee, d ata specified a t 42 CFR 422.119, 431.60, 457.730, and 45 CFR 156.221. Specifically, we are requiring that the Patient Access API must, at a mi nimum, make available adjudicated cl aims (including p r ovider remittances and enroll sharing); encounters with capitated ders; and cl inical data, including laboratory re sults (when maintained by the impacted pa ye r). Data must b e m ade available no later t han one (1) bus iness day af ter a claim is adjudicated or enc ounter d ata ar e received. We are requiring that beginning January 1, 2 021, im pacted pa yers make available through the Patient A ccess API t he specified data they maintain with a date of service on or after January 1, 2016. This is consistent with the requirements for the payer -to-payer data exchange detailed in sect ion V . of thi s final rule. T ogether these polici es facilitat e the creation and maintenance of a patient's cumulative health record w ith their curren t payer. W e are finalizi ng regulations to r equire that MA organizations, Medicai d and CHIP FF S programs, Medi ca id m anaged ca re plans, and C HIP m anaged car e entities make standardized information about their provider networks ava ilable th rough a Provider Directory A PI that is conformant with the technical standards finalized by HHS in the ONC 21st Century Cures Act final rule (published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Regist er) at 45 CFR 170.215, excludi ng the se curity protocols related to user authenticati on and authorization a nd any other pr otocols th at restric t availability of this in for mation to particul ar persons or organizations. Authentication and authorization protocols are not necessary when making publicl y available da ta accessible via an A PI. We are finalizing that the Provider Directory API must be ac cessible via a public-facing digital endpoint on the payer's website to ensure public discovery and access. CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 15 At a minimum, these payers must make available via the Provider Directory API provider names, addresses, phone numbers, and specialties. For MA organizations that offer MA -PD plans, they must als o make available, at a minimum, pharmacy directory data, including the pharmacy name, address, phone number, number of pharmacies in the network, and mix (specifically the type of pharmacy, such as \"retail pharmacy\"). All directory information must be made available to current and prospective enrollees and the public through the Provider Directory API within 30 calendar days of a payer receiving provider directory information or an update to the provider directory information. The Provider Directory API is being finalized at 42 CFR 422.120 for MA organizations, at 42 CFR 431.70 for Medicaid state agencies, at 42 CFR 438.242(b)(6) for Medicaid managed care plans, at 42 CFR 457.760 for CHIP state agencies, and at 42 CFR 457.1233(d)(3) for CHIP managed care ent ities. Here we are finalizing that a ccess to the published Provider Directory API must be fully implemented by January 1, 2021. We do strongly encourage payers to make their Provider Directory API public as soon as possible to make and show progress toward meeting all the API requirements being finalized in this rule. We are finalizing our proposal, with certain modifications as detailed in section V. of this final rule, to require MA organizations, Medicaid managed care plans, CHIP managed care entities, and QHP issuers on the FFEs to coordinate care between payers by exchanging, at a minimum, the data elements specified in the current content and vocabulary standard finalized by HHS in the ONC 21st Century Cures Act final rule (published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register ) at 45 CFR 170.213 (currently the \"United States Core Data for Interoperability\" (USCDI) version 1 6). This payer- to-payer data exchange requires these payers, 6 Office of the National Coordinator. (n.d.). U.S. Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI). at 42 CFR 422.119( f) for MA organizations, at 42 CFR 438.62(b)(1)(vi) for Medicaid managed care plans (and by extensi on under \u00a7 457. 1216 CH IP managed care entities), and at 45 CFR 156.221( f) for QHP is suers on th e F FEs, to s end, a t a current or former enrollee's request, s pecific information they maintain with a date of se rvice on or after Januar y 1, 2016 to any other payer identified by the current enrollee or forme r enrollee. This is consistent with the Pa tient Access A PI detailed in s ection III. of this f inal rul e. We are al so finalizing a provision that a p ayer is onl y obligated to s hare da ta received from another payer under this re gu lation in the electronic for m and format it was r eceived. This is intended to reduce burden on payers. We are finalizing t hat t his payer -to-payer data exchange must be full y implemented by January 1, 2022. In r esponse to comments discusse d more fully below, we ar e not finalizi ng our proposal to require M A organizations, Medicaid manag ed care plans, CHIP m anaged car e enti ties, and QHP issuers on the FFEs to participate in a trusted exchange network given the concerns commenters raised regarding the need f or a mature Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement (TEFCA) to be in place fi rst, and appreciati ng that work on TEFCA is ongoi ng at this time. We ar e f inalizing the requirements that al l states participat e in da ily ex change of buy-in da ta, whic h includes both sending data to CMS and receiving responses from CMS daily, and that all states submit the MMA file d ata to C MS daily by April 1, 2022 i n accordance with 42 CF R 406.26 , 407.40, and 423.910, respectively, as proposed. These requirements will improve the experience of dually eligible individuals by improvi ng the ability of pr oviders and payers to coordinate eligibility, enrollment, benefits, and/or care for this population. CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 17 We are finalizing our proposal to include an indicator on Physician Compare fo r the eligible clinicians and groups that submit a \"no\" response to any of the three preventi on of infor mation blocking statements fo r M IPS. In th e e vent that the se s tatements a re left blank, the attestations will be considered in complete, a nd we will not include an indicator on Phys ician Compare. The indicator will be posted on Physician Compare, either on the profile pages or in the downloadable database, starti ng with the 2019 per formance period data available for public reporti ng starting i n late 2020. We are finalizing our proposal to include information on a publ icly available CMS website indicating that an eligible ho s pital or critical access h ospital (CAH) attesting under the Medicare FFS Promoting Interoperability Program had submitted a \"no\" response t o any of the three attestation statements related t o the prevention of inf ormation blocking. In the event that an eligible hospital or CAH leaves a \"blank\" response, the attestations will be considered incomplete, and no inf ormation w ill be posted related to the se attestation statements. We w ill post this in formation starting with th e a ttestations for the E H R re porting period in 20 19 and expe ct this informati on will be posted in late 2020. A dditionally, a s detailed in section IX. of this f in al rule, we are finalizi ng our proposal to publ icly report the names and NPIs of those providers who do not have digital contact informati on include d i n the National Plan and Provider Enumeration System (NPPES) system beginni ng in the second ha lf of 2020 as propose d. Additionally, we will continue to ensure provi ders a re aware of t he benefits o f including digital contact information in N PPES, a nd when a nd where their names and NPIs will be posted if they do not include this information. We do strongl y encourage provi ders to include FHIR endpoi nt information in NPPES if and when they have the information, as well. CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 18 To further advance electronic exchange of information that supports effective transitions of care we are finalizi ng the requirement for a hospital, psychiatric hospital, and CAH , which util izes an electronic m edica l records s ystem or ot her electronic a dm inistrative system that is conformant with the content exchange standard at 45 CFR 170.205(d)(2) to demonstrate that: (1) its system's notification capacity is fully ope rat ional and that it operates i n a ccordance w ith all st ate and federal s t atutes and regulations regarding the exchange of patient he alth i nformation; (2) its s ystem sends notifications tha t mus t include the m ini mum patient he alth information specified in section X. of this fin al rule; and (3) its system sends notifications directly, or through an intermediary tha t facilitates e xchange of health inf ormation, and at the tim e of a pa tient's registration in the emergency de partment or admission to inpatient services, a nd also prior to, or at t he time o f, a pa tient's di s charge a nd/or transfer from the emergency d epa rtment or inpa tient services, t o all app licable post- acute care services providers and suppl iers, primary ca re pr actitioners and groups, and other practitioners and groups identified by the patient as pr imarily responsible for his or her care, a nd who or which need to receive not ification of the patient's status for treatment, c are c oor dination, or quality improvement purposes. We are establishing that this po licy w ill be applicable 6 mont hs aft er publication of this rule for hospi tals, including psychiatric hospitals, a nd C AHs to a llow for adequate a n d additional time for these in stitutions, especially small and/ or rural ho spitals as well as CAHs, t o come into com pliance with the new requi rements. Finally, we note that we include d two RFIs in th e proposed rule: one related to interoperability a nd health IT a doption in P A C settings and one related to the role o f patient matching in interoperability and improved patient care. We thank commenters for the insights CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 19 shared on these two topics. We are reviewing these comments and will take them into consideration for potential future rulemaking. Throughout this final rule, we refer to terms such as \"patient,\" \"consumer,\" \"beneficiary,\" \"enrollee, \" and \"individual.\" We note that every reader of this final rule is a patient and has or will receive medical care at some point in their life. In this final rule, we use the term \"patient\" as an inclusive term, but because we have historically referred to patients using the other terms noted above in our regulations, we use specific terms as applicable in sections of this final rule to refer to individuals covered under the health care programs that CMS administers and regulates. We also note that when we discuss patients, we acknowledge a patient's personal representative. Per the HIPAA privacy regulations at 45 CFR 164.502(g), a personal representative is someone authorized under state or other applicable law to act on behalf of the individual in making health care related decisions (such as a parent, guardian, or person with a medical power of attorney). 7 Policies in this final rule that require a patient's action could be addressed by a patient's personal representative. We also use terms such as \"payer,\" \"plan,\" and \" issuer \" in this final rule. Certain portions of this final rule are applicable to the Medicare Fee -for-Service (FFS) Program, the Medicaid FFS Program, the CHIP FFS program, Medicare Advantage (MA) organizations, Medicaid Managed Care plans (managed care organizations (MCOs), prepaid inpatient health plans (PIHPs), and prepaid ambulatory health plans (PAHPs)), CHIP Managed Care entities (MCOs, PIHPs, and PAHPs), and QHP issuers on the FFEs. We use the term \"payer\" in the preamble of this final rule as an inclusive term for all these programs (and plan types in the case of plans), but 7 See OCR guidance regarding personal representatives at https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for also us e specifi c terms as applicable in sections of this final r ule. F inally, we use t he term \"provider,\" too, as an inclusive term comprisi ng individua ls, organi zations, a nd institutions that provide health ser vices, such as clinicians, hos pitals, sk ill ed nursing facilities, hom e heal th agencies, hospice settings, laboratories, suppliers of durable medical equipment, community based organization s, etc., as appropriate in the context used. II. T echnical Standards Related t o Int eroperability P rovision s, an d Analysis of and Responses to Public Comments A. Technical Approac h and Standards 1. Use of Health Level 7\u00ae (HL7) Fast Healthcare Interop erability Resources\u00ae (F HIR) for APIs Section 106(b)(1)(B)(i i) of the Medicare A ccess and CH IP Reauthorization A ct of 2015 (MACRA) defines h ealth IT \" interoperability\" as the ability of two or more he a lth inf ormation syst ems or components to exchange clinical and other informati on and to use the informa tion that has been exchanged using common standards to provide access to longitudinal information for health c a r e providers in order to facilitate c oordina ted c are a nd improved pa tient outcomes. Interoperability is also de fined in section 3000 of the Public H ealth Service Act (PHSA) (42 U.S.C. 300jj), as amended by secti on 4003 of the 21st Centur y Cures Act. Under that definition, \"interoperability,\" with respect to he alth IT, m eans such he alth I T that en ables the sec ure exchange of electronic health information with, and use of elect ronic health information from, other health IT w ithout spe cial effor t on the part of the us er; allow s for complete a ccess, exchange, a nd use of all electronically acce ssib le he alth information for authorized use unde r applicable s tate or federal law; and does not constitute in formation blocking as defined in s ection 3022(a) of t he PHSA, which was added by section 4004 of the Cures Act. We believe the PHSA definition is consistent with the MACRA definition of \"interoperability\". Consistent with the CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 21 CMS Interoperability and Patient Access proposed rule (84 FR 7619), we will use the PHSA definition of \"interoperability\" for the purposes of this final rule. We believe the PHSA definition of \"int eroperability\" is useful as a foundational reference for our approach to advancing the interoperability and exchange of electronic health information for individuals throughout the United States, and across the entire spectrum of provider types and care settings with which health insurance issuers and administrators need to efficiently exchange multiple types of relevant data. We noted the PHSA definition of \"interoperability\" is not limited to a specific program or initiative, but rather can be applied to all activities under the title of the PHSA that establishes ONC's responsibilities to support and shape the health information ecosystem, including the exchange infrastructure for the U.S. health care system as a whole. The PHSA definition is also consiste nt with HHS's vision and strategy for achieving a health information ecosystem within which all individuals, their personal representatives, their health care providers, and their payers are able to send, receive, find, and use electronic health informatio n in a manner that is appropriate, secure, timely, and reliable to support the health and wellness of individuals through informed, shared decision-making, 8 as well as to support consumer choice of payers and providers. We summarize the public comment we received on use of the PHSA definition of \"interoperability\" and provide our response. Comment: One commenter specifically supported the use of the PHSA de finition of \"interoperability\". 8 See, f or example, Office of the National Coordinator. (2015). Connecting Health and Care for the Nation: A Shared Nat ionwide Interoperabilit y Roadmap, F ina l Version 1.0. Retrieved from https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/hie -interoperability/nationwide 22 Response : We appreciate the commenter's support. A core policy principle we aim to support across all policies in this rule is that every American should be able, without special effort or advanced technical skills, to see, obtain, and use all electronically available information that is relevant to their health, care, and choices - of plans, providers, and specific treatment options. In the proposed rule, we explained this included two types of information: personal health information that health care providers and health plans, or payers, must make available to an individual, such as their current and past medical conditions and care received; and information that is of general interest and should be widely available, such as plan provider networks, the plan's formulary, and coverage policies (84 FR 7619). We also discussed that while many consumers today can often access their own electronic health information through patient or enrollee portals and proprietary applications made available by various providers and health plans, they must typically go through separate processes to obtain access to each system, and often need to manually aggregate information that is delivered in various, often non-standardized, formats. The complex tasks of accessing and piecing together this information can be burdensome and frustrating to consumers. An API can be thought of as a set of commands, functions, protocols, or tools published by one software developer (\"A\") that enable other software developers to create programs (applications or \"apps\") that can interact with A's software without needing to know the internal workings of A's software, all while maintaining consumer privacy data standards 9. This is how API technology enables the se amless user experiences associated with applications familiar from other aspects of many consumers' daily lives, such as travel and personal finance. Standardized, 9 See https://www.hl7.org/fhir/security.html for information on how F HIR servers and resources integrate privacy and security protocols into the data exchange via an API. CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 23 transparent, and pro- competitive API technology can enable similar benefits to consumers of health care services.10 While acknowledging the limits of our authority to require use of APIs to address our goals for interoperability and data access, we proposed to use our programmatic authority to require that a variety of data be made accessible b y requiring that MA organizations, Medicaid state agencies, Medicaid managed care plans, CHIP agencies, CHIP managed care entities, and QHP issuers on the FFEs, adopt and implement \"openly published,\" or secure, standards- based APIs. In the CMS Interoperab ility and Patient Access proposed rule, we used the short form terminology, \"open API\". We appreciate that this term can be misunderstood to mean \"open\" as in \"not secure\". In actuality, an \"open API\" is a secure, standards- based API that has certain techn ical information openly published to facilitate uniform use and data sharing in a secure, standardized way. To avoid this misinterpretation, we will use the term \"standards -based API\" in this final rule where we used \"open API\" in the proposed rule. This i s also in better alignment with the terminology used in the ONC 21st Century Cures Act proposed rule (84 FR 7453) and final rule (published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register). We noted that having certain data available through standards -based APIs would allow impacted enrollees to use the application of their choice to access and use their own electronic health information and other related information to manage their health. See section III.C.2.a. of the CMS Interoperability and Patient Acce ss proposed rule for further discussion (84 FR 7629). Much like our efforts under Medicare Blue Button 2.0, also part of the MyHealthEData initiative, which made Parts A, B, and D claims and encounter data available via an API to 10 ONC has made availabl e a succinct, non-technical ove rview of APIs in context of consumers' access to their own me dical information across multiple providers' EHR s ystems, which i s available at the thIT.gov https://www.healthit.gov/api-e ducation-m odule/story_html5.html. CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 24 Medicar e beneficiaries, t he policies i n thi s rule e xtend these benefits to even mo re patients. A s of Ja nuary 2020, over 53,000 Medicare beneficiaries have taken advantage of Blue Button. Currently, there are 55 production applications and over 2,500 developers working in the Blue Button sandbox. For more information on Blue Button 2.0 see section III. of this final rule. As we noted in the CMS Int eroperability and Patient Access proposed rule, we believe that our Patient Access A PI, in pa rticular, w ill result in c laims a nd encounte r informati on be coming easily acce ssible for the va st m ajority o f patients enrolled w ith pa yers regulated by C MS. A s finalized, these pol icies w ill apply to a ll MA or ganizations, a ll Medicaid and CHIP F F S programs, al l types of M edicaid m anaged car e plans (MCOs, P IHPs, and P A HPs), as well as CH IP m anaged car e entities, and QHP issuers on t he FFEs. We hope that s tates operating Exchanges might consider adopting similar requirements for QHPs on the State-Based Exchanges (SBEs), and that other payers in the private se ctor might consider voluntarily offering data accessibility of the type included in the policies being finalized here so that eve n more pat ients across the American he alth c are system can easi ly ha ve and use such i nformation to advanc e their choi ce and pa rticipation in the ir health c a re. In this w ay, w e hope that the e xample be ing set by C MS w ill ra ise consumers' expe ctations and encourage other pa yers in the market to take similar st eps to a dvance patient acce ss and em pow erment outside the scop e of the requirements being finalized i n this rule. We expl ained in the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access proposed rule (84 FR 7620) that those seeking further information regarding what a standards- based A PI is are encourage d to review the dis cussi on of the standardized API cr iterion and associated policy pri nciples and technical standards included in ONC's 21st Century Cures Act proposed rule (84 FR 7424) and final rule (published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register). These rules CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 25 provide m ore detailed information on API functionality and interoperability standards relevant to electronic health information. We noted that while that discussion was specific to health IT, including Electronic Health Records (EHR) systems, certified under ONC's Health IT Certification Program rather than the information systems generally used by payers and plan issuers for claims, encounters, or other administrative or plan operational data, it included information applicable to interoperability standards, as wel l as considerations relevant to establishing reasonable and non -discriminatory terms of service for applications seeking to connect to the standards- based API discussed in this rule. While we reiterate that we did not propose to require payers to use Healt h IT Modules certified under ONC's program to make administrative data such as claims history or provider directory information available to enrollees, we believe that the discussion of APIs and related standards in the ONC 21st Century Cures Act rules wil l be of use to those seeking to better understand the role of APIs in health care information exchange. We also discussed in our proposed rule how other industries have advanced the sort of standards-based API- driven interoperability and innovation that we seek in the health system (84 FR 7620). We have sought to collaborate and align with ONC's proposed and final policies specifically related to APIs under the Cures Act as we developed and finalized these policies. In general, as we noted in our propose d rule, we believe the following three attributes of standards - based APIs are particularly important to achieving the goal of offering individuals convenient access, through applications they choose, to available and relevant electronic health and health-related information: The API technologies themselves, not just the data accessible through them, are standardized; CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 26 The APIs are technically transparent; and The APIs are implemented in a pro- competitive manner. In that section of the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access proposed rule, we discussed these concepts generally and how they were applicable in the health care context for all payers, and explained how these were relevant to our specific proposals, which are discussed in detail in section III. of this final rule. To revisit this full discussion, see the proposed rule (84 FR 7620 through 7621). We did not receive comments on this general discussion. Any comments on specific proposals that refer to these three attributes are discussed in this final rule in the context of the specific proposals. 2. Privacy and Security Concerns in the Context of APIs As we noted in the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access proposed rule, HHS has received a wide range of stakeholder feedback on privacy and security issues in response to prior proposals 11 about policies related to APIs that would allow consumers to use an app of their choosing to access protected health information (PHI) held by or on behalf of a HIPAA covered entity. Such feedback included concerns about potential security risks to PHI created by an API connecting to third- party applications and the implications of an individual's data being shared with these third -party apps at the direction of the individual. As we discussed in our Interoperability and Patient Access proposed rule (84 FR 7621), deploying API technology would offer consumers the opportunity to access their electronic health information held by covered entities (including, but not limited to MA organizations, the Medi care Part A and B programs, the Medicaid program, CHIP, QHP issuers on the FFEs, and other health insurance issuers in the private markets), and would not lessen any such covered 11 For instance, see discussion of stakeholder comments in the 2015 Edition final rule at 80 FR 62676. CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 27 entity's duties unde r HIPAA and other laws to protect the pri vacy and securit y of information it c reates, receives, maintains, or transmits , including but not lim ited to PHI. A covered entity implementing a n API to e na ble individuals to access the ir health in formation mus t take reasonable steps to ensure an individual' s information is only disclosed as permitted or required by applicable law. The entity must take grea ter care in configuring a nd maintaining the security functionalities of the API and the covered e ntities' electronic inf or mation systems to which it connects than would be needed i f it w as implementing an A PI simply t o allow easier access to wi dely available public informati on. In acco rdance with th e H IPAA P rivacy and S ecurity R ules, the covered entity is required to imp leme nt reasonable s afeguards to protect PHI while in transit. If an individual requests their PHI in an EHR be sent to t he third party by unencrypted e-ma il or in another unsecure manner, which the individual has a right to request, reasonable safeguards could include, for example, carefull y checki ng the individual's em ail address for accuracy and warning the individual o f ri sks associated w ith the unsecure transmission. We not e that t he st andards- based A PIs discussed i n t his final r ule are secure methods of da ta exchange. HIPAA cov ered en tities and t heir bu siness associates continue to be responsible for compliance with the HIPAA R ules, the Federal Trade Comm ission Act (FTC A ct), a nd all other laws applicable to their business ac tivities including but not limited to their handling of enrollees' PHI and othe r data. A s we stated i n the CMS Interoperability an d Patient A ccess proposed rule (84 FR 7610) , nothing proposed in that rule was intended to alter or should be construe d as altering existing responsibilities t o protect PHI unde r the HI PAA Rules or any othe r laws that are currently applicable. However, we acknowledged that a number of industry stakeholders may mistakenly believe that they are responsible for determining whether an application to which an individual CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 28 directs their PHI employs appropriate safeguards regarding the information it receives. In the proposed rule we discussed Office for Civil Rights (OCR) guidance that noted that covered entities are not responsible under the HIPAA Rules for the security of PHI once it has been received by a third-party application chosen by an individual (84 FR 7621 through 7622). Further, we noted in the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access proposed rule that the HIPAA Privacy Rule 12 established the individual's right of access, including a right to inspect and/or receive a copy of PHI held in designated record sets by covered entities and their business associates as detailed at 45 CFR 164.524. We specifically noted in the proposed rule that OCR had indicated in regulations and guidance, that an individual could exercise their right of access by requesting that their information be sent to a third party. 13 As we also noted in the proposed rule (84 FR 7622), we are aware of stakeholder concerns about which protections apply to non- covered entities, such as direct- to-consumer applications. As we explained in the proposed rule, when a non-covered entity discloses an individual's confidential information in a manner or for a purpose not consistent with the privacy notice and terms of use to which the individual agreed, the FTC has authority under section 5 of the FTC Act (15 U.S.C. Sec. 45(a)) to investigate and take action against unfair or deceptive trade practices. The FTC has applied this authority to a wide variety of entities. 14 The FTC also enforces the F TC Health Breach Notification Rule, which applies to certain types of entities, 5 More information on the Privacy Rule, including related rulemaking actions and additional interpretive guidance, is availab le at https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-p rofessionals/privacy/index.html. 13 14 See also cases where this authority was used, such as 2012 FTC action against Facebook (see https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/cases-p roceedings/092 -3184/facebook-i nc) and 2012 vendors of personal health records and third-party service providers, that fall outside of the scope of HIPAA, and therefore, are not subject to the HIPAA Breach Notification Rule.15 This FTC Health Breach Notification Rule explains the process and steps third parties must follow when they discover a breach of identifiable personal health record information they maintain. Any violation of this Rule is enforced by the F TC as an unfair or deceptive act or practice under the FTC Act. We recognized that this is a complex landscape for patients, who we anticipate will want to exercise due diligence on their own behalf in reviewing the terms of service and other information a bout the applications they consider selecting. Therefore, we proposed specific requirements on payers to ensure enrollees have the opportunity to become more informed about how to protect their PHI, important things to consider in selecting an application, and where they can submit a complaint if they believe a HIPAA covered entity or business associate may not be in compliance with their duties under the HIPAA Rules, or if they believe they have been subjected to unfair or deceptive acts or practices related to a direct -to-consumer application's privacy practices or terms of use. A full discussion of the Enrollee and Beneficiary Resources Regarding Privacy and Security provision can be found in section III.C.2.h. of this final rule. In some circumstances, w e noted that the information that we proposed to require be made available through an API per a patient's request, under the various program- specific authorities authorizing this rulemaking, were also consistent with the enrollee's right of access for their data held by a covered entity or their business associate under the HIPAA Privacy Rule. But we also noted that some data to which an individual is entitled to access under HIPAA may 15 See 1 6 CFR part 3 18; s ee al so https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/non - covered_entities_report_june_17_2016.pdf. CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 30 not be required to be transferred through the API. For instance, when the covered entity does not hold certain information electronically. In those instances, we noted that the inability to access data via an API would in no way limit or alter responsibilities and requirements under other law (including though not limited to the HIPAA Privacy, Security, and Breach Notification Rules) that apply to the organizations that would be subject to this regulation. Even as these requirements are finalized, the organization may still be called upon to respond to individuals' request for information not available through the API, or for all of their information through means other than the API. We encouraged HIPAA covered entities and business associates to review the OCR website for resources on the individual access standard at https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for- professionals/privacy/guidance/access/index.html to ensure they understand their responsibilities . We again encourage HIPAA covered entities and business associates to review their responsibilities under HIPAA in light of the recent decision in Ciox Health, LLC v. Azar, et al., No. 18- cv-0040 (D.D.C. January 23, 2020).16 The court order vacates a portion of the HIPAA Privacy Rule relat ed to the individual right of access \"insofar as it expands the HITECH Act's third -party directive beyond requests for a copy of an electronic health record with respect to [protected health information] of an individual . . . in an electronic format.\"17 Generally, the court order vac ates a portion of the HIPAA Privacy Rule that provides an individual the right to direct a covered entity to send protected health information that is not in an EHR to a third party identified by the individual. 16 See, https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-b This decision doe s not affect CMS ' programmatic a uthorities, a s discussed in de tail i n se ction III. of the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access proposed rule (83 FR 7629 through 7630) and section III. of this fin al rul e, to pr opose and finalize the Patient A ccess A PI for the pr ograms s pecified. Additionally, the court's de c ision did not alter individuals ' righ t under HI PAA t o request and ob tain a copy of their r eco rds. B ecause the goal o f the Patient A ccess API in our programs is to give patients access to their own inf orm ation for their own pe rso nal use through a third- party app , we believe t hese policies as adopted i n this r ule remain consistent w it h the spirit of access rights unde r HIPAA. A s discussed i n detail b el ow, m any commenters discussed the issues of p rivacy and security in regard to information made a vailable to thi rd-party a pplications. H e re, we summarize t he public comments we received on general issues and concerns around privac y and security of a sta ndards-based API, and provide our responses. Comment : A few commenters s up ported O CR's e f forts to more c learly a ccount for use cases, or specific situations, i n which apps are used to exc hange patients' el ect ronic health information. Some commenters noted support for OCR's FAQ that specifies that covered entit ies are not responsible o r liable fo r the privacy and s ecurity o f PHI once it is tra nsmitted at the individual's directi on to a nd received by a third- party ap plication. One commenter ex pressed concer n that CMS and O NC proposed requirements would make the safeguards of HIPAA moot if HIPAA is not extended to thi rd-party applications tha t are able unde r this rule to display patient da ta. Wi thout ext ending HIPAA, t he commenter fears payers and provider s will be liable if the thi rd-party misuses pa tient data. Re sponse : We appreciate the commenters' supp ort. We r eiterate that H IPAA cove red entities and b usiness associates are responsible for meeting their HIPAA privacy and security CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 32 obligations to protect patient data th ey maintain, and absent patient requests to th e contrary, are obligated t o take reasonable measures to protect these data in transit. O nce these data are transmi tted a nd no longer unde r t he control of the covere d entity or busin ess associate, those entities no longer have any obli gations unde r HIPAA for the privacy and security of the PH I, becaus e these data are no longer sub ject to H IPAA. We stress, as discussed in the CMS Int eroperability and Patient Access p ropos ed ru le, no thi ng in this rul e a lters c overed e ntities' or busi ness associates' responsibiliti es to protect P HI unde r the H IPAA P rivacy and S ecurity R ules. The only instance per the policies proposed in t his rul e tha t would a llow a payer to d e ny access to a n app, as discussed in the proposed rule and unde rlying the rationale for finalizing 42 this rule), 457.730(e), 457.1233(d)(2), and 45 CFR 156.221( e), would be if the covered entity or its busine ss associate's own system s would be endangered if it were to engage with a specific third -party applicati on t hrough an API, for instance if all owing such access would result in an unacceptable security risk. Therefore, as we also noted, cove red entities and business associates are free to offer a dvice t o patients on the potential risks invo l ved w ith re questing data transfers to an application or entity not covere d by H IPAA , but such efforts gene rally must stop at education and awareness or advi ce r egarding concerns related t o a specific app . For instance, if a payer notes that an app a patient reques ts receive their d ata does not lay out in its privacy po l icy specifically how the patient's personal data will be used, the payer could choose to inform the pat ient they may not want to s hare their data with that app without a clear unde rstanding of how the app may use the data, including details about the app's secondary data use policy. If the patient stil l wants the ir data to b e s hared, or does not respond to the payer's w a r ning, the payer would need to share these data via the API ab sent an unacceptable security risk to the payer's CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 33 own system. For more information on this ability to inform patients, see section III.C.2.g. of this final rule. The requirements finalized in this rule do not impact or change obligations under the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules in any way. Comment : A few commenters noted discrepancies in the term inology used in the OCR FAQ mentioned in the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access proposed rule compared to terminology used throughout the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access proposed rule and the ONC 21st Century Cures Act proposed rule, and sugge sted that any terminology inconsistencies be addressed and harmonized. These commenters noted that the OCR FAQ pertains to \"electronic protected health information\" (ePHI), and uses the term \"electronic health record (EHR) system developer\", which differs from terms used in the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access and the ONC 21st Century Cures Act proposed rules. Response : We appreciate comments regarding variance in the terminology used in OCR guidance and the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access proposed rule. Regarding the relationship between ePHI and electronic health information (EHI), we refer readers to the discussion in the ONC 21st Century Cures Act final rule (published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register ). OCR guidance uses the term \"electronic health record system developer\" 18 to refer to a health IT developer that develops and maintains electronic health record systems containing PHI for a covered entity, and therefore is a business associate of those covered entities. The gui dance also uses \"app developer\" to describe the creator of the app that is designated to receive an individual's PHI. ONC uses related terms that have a specific meaning within the context of ONC programs. For instance, ONC uses the term \"health IT developer\" for 18 See Office of the National Coordinator. (n.d.). Healt h Informati on T H ealth IT C ertification P rogra m to refer to a ve ndor, s elf-developer, or ot her entity t hat presents he alth IT for certification or has he alth IT c ertified unde r the program. In a ddition, the ONC 21st Century Cures Act proposed rule proposed to define the term \"health IT de veloper of certified he alth IT\" for the pur poses of implementing provisions of the C ur es A ct (84 FR 7510) . We do not use these ONC program- specific te rms in th is CMS rul e. We simply refer to any developer of a third-party app, of which an electronic record systems developer may be one. C omment : One commenter requested c la rification on a c ove red e ntity's l iability und er HIPAA if a pa tient transfers the ir health information from a covered e ntity's mob il e access po rtal or application to a th ird-party application not covered under HIPAA. Response : As noted abov e, HIPAA c ov ered en tities and bus iness associates are responsible for meeting their HIPAA privacy and securit y obligations to protect pati ent data they maintain, and abs ent patient r equ est s to the contrary, are obligated to take r easonabl e measures to protect these da ta in transit. O nce t hese dat a are received by a third-part y and no longer unde r t he control of t he covered entity o r its business associate, t h e covered ent ity an d bus iness associate a re not liable for the pr i vacy a nd security o f the PHI or any e lec tronic h ealth inf ormation sen t. While e ntities and their bu siness associat es may not ify patients of their po tential c oncerns regardi ng exchanging data with a specific third -p arty not covered by HIPAA, they are not require d to do so, and they may not substitute their own judgment for that of the patient requesting the data be transferred. Comment : Several com menters recommended that C MS i nclude a safe harbor provision in the regulatory t ext of this fin al rule to indi cate t hat plans a nd pr oviders a re not responsible for the downstream privacy and security of PHI. CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 35 Response : Regarding commenters' interest \"safe ha rbor\" pr ovision for cov ered entities w hen da ta is transmitted to a third-party app, w e do not have the authority, nor do we believe it is necessary, to incorporate these principles in a safe harbor provision under the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules . Covered entities and busi ness associates are not responsible for the data after t he data have been received by t he intended r ecipient. T his has been t aken i nto account in developing t he requirements for t he Patient A ccess API. Com ment : Several com menters expressed con cerns that ap p de velopers are not sub ject to many of the current laws pr ote cting the privacy a nd s ecurity of electronic he alth information. Several commenters requested that HHS spe cif y what requirements non -HIPAA covered app developers will be subject to. Response : We appreciate the comm enters' conc erns. A s discussed i n the CMS Int eroperabilit y and Patient Acc ess proposed rule (84 FR 7622) , HIPAA protections do not extend to third- party a pp s (tha t is, s oftware a pplications from e ntities that a re not covered e ntities or busi ness associates) . However, the FTC has the aut horit y to investigate and take action against unfair o r deceptive trade pract ices under the FTC Act and the FTC H ealth B r each N otification Rule when a third-part y app does not adher e to the stated privacy polic y. We have shar ed these comments w ith th e F TC. S tate la ws m ay pr ovide a dditional protections as w ell. A lthough CMS cannot regulate the third-party apps directly, a nd thus cannot es tablish specific requirements for them, we are sharing b est practi ces and lesson s learned from our expe rience with B l ue Button 2.0, as applicable, with app developers to further support strong privac y and securit y practices : htt ps://www.cms.gov/Regulations- and-Guidance/Guidance/Interoperability/index. A lso, as previously noted, payers will be required to share educational resources with patients regarding how to choose a third-p arty application while protecting their health information. Further, as CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 36 discussed in section III. of this f inal r ule, w e are providing payers with a framework t hey can us e to request that third- p arty app s attest t o cove ring cer tain c riteria in their pr ivacy pol i cy, suc h as inf ormation about secon dar y data use, w hich pa yers can us e to educ ate patients about t heir opti ons. In additi on, there are technical requirements for APIs defined in the ONC 21st Century Cures Act proposed rule, and finalized by HHS in ONC's final rule (published elsewhere in this issue of the F ederal Register ) at 45 CFR 170.2 15, that enable and support persistent user authentication and app authorizati on processes. It is impo rtant to clarify that any app accessing the Patient Access API would be doing so onl y with the approval a nd a t the direction of the spe cific patient. Whi le these technical st anda rds at 45 CFR 170.215 establish t he requirements for the API i tself, w hen i mplemented, the s e technica l standards in tur n set re quirements on the app developer for the app's identit y proofing and authentication processes that mus t be met in order t o connect to t he API and access the specific patient' s data through the API, as further discusse d in section III. of this final rule. These technical requirements do not, however, address conc erns around data securit y and use once data are with the third-part y. This level of pri vacy and securit y would be addresse d in the app's te rms and conditions or privacy notice. Comment: Many commenters expressed concern regarding the sec ondary use of health information by business part ners of third- party applications . A few com menters noted that consumer s may not always be aware of the business partners of thi rd-party ap ps, especially as this in formation is typically pa rt of a lengthy privacy n otice o r dense or difficu lt to un derstand terms and conditions. Response: We appreciate the commenters' concerns. As noted, we do not have the authority to directly regulate third-party apps. As a result, we cannot dictate how an app uses or CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 37 shares data. We have chosen to r equ ire payer s to educ ate patients about h ow to choos e a third - pa rty app that be st mi tigates potentially r isks related t o secondary da t a uses. O ne way w e will address these concerns is to offer pa yers and app developer s best practices from our own e xperiences using a patient-centere d privacy policy, particularly related to Blue But ton 2.0. As we discuss in section III.C.2.h. of this final rule, we recognize tha t the payers that will be subject to the API provisions of this f inal rule a re in the best position to ens ure t hat pa tients have the i nformation that they need to c riticall y assess the privacy and securit y of thei r designate d third- party options, and may be best situated to identify for patients the potential implications of sharing data and to advise a patient if there is a breach of their data. This is why we proposed and are finalizing a requirement at 42 CFR 422.119( g), 431.60(f), 457.730(f), 438.242(b)(5) (proposed as \u00a7 see section 45 CFR patient facing privacy and secu rity i nformation that m ust be made available on the websites of t he payers subject t o t his final r ule. A s discussed i n greater d e t ail in section III.C.2.h. of this final rule, CMS will be providing payers with suggested content they can consult and tailor as they w ork to produce the required patient resource document . We are a l so sharing be st practices and links to model language of an easy-to-understand, non- technical, cons umer -friendly privacy policy, again building off of ou r lessons learne d with Blue Butt on 2.0, t o support payers and de velopers in this effort: https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and- Gui dance/Guidance/Interoperability/index. A lso, as noted abo ve, w e discuss in sec tion III. of this final rule, a framework payers can u se to request t hat third -party ap ps attest t o covering certai n criteria in their privacy p olicy, such a s information a bout secondary da ta use. It will be impor tant to encourage patients' understanding of app privacy policies, including secondary use policies. CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 38 The policies we are finalizi ng in this rule help us support payers and developers as they work to make sure patients are informed consumers through educ ation and aw areness, and that rights. Comment: Several commenters expresse d con cerns over the complexity of overlapping federal and state privac y laws, whic h they note d would be perpe tuated by uncertaint y in privacy and secur ity r equirements when apps becom e more widely us ed i n the health ca re space. T hese commenters requested work be done to harmonize state and federal privacy laws. Another commenter recommended that Congress enact comprehensive consumer privacy protections. Response: We appreciate these commenters' concerns and recommendations. H owever, t hese comments are beyond the scope of this regulation. C omment: Severa l c ommenters r ecommended that CMS w ork c losely w ith ot her HHS agenc ies and t he FTC t o establish a transparent regulatory f ramework fo r safeguarding the pri vacy and s ecurity of patient electronic health informati on shared wit h apps. A few comm enters recommended C MS est ablish w orkgroups to sha re experiences and technical assistanc e for implementing privacy and secur ity approaches. Response: We appreciate the commenters' sugg estions. A s noted above , we have shared commenter's concerns with the FTC and relevant HHS Operating Divisions, such as OCR. 3. Specific Technical Approach and Standards Achieving interoperability throughout the health system is essential to achieving an effective, va lue-conscious health sys tem w i thin w hich cons umers are able to choos e from an array of health plans a nd providers. An interoperable system should ensure that consumers can both easil y access th e ir electronic h ealth information held by plans a nd routinely e xpe ct that their claims, encounter, and other relevant health history information will follow them smoothly from CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 39 plan to pla n and provider to provi der without burdensome requirements for them or their provi ders to reassemble or re- document the information. Ready availability of health information ca n be especially helpful when an individual cannot access their usual source of care, for instance i f care is n eeded out side their regular pr ovide r's business hours, while traveling, or in t he wake of a natural di saster. T he proposals describe d in section III.C.2. of the C MS Interoperability and Patient Access proposed rule (84 FR 7628 through 7639) would impose new requirements on MA organizations, Medicai d and CHIP FFS programs, Medicai d managed care plans , CHIP managed care entities, and QHP issuers on the FFEs (excluding issuers offering only SADPs or issuers in the FF-SHOP, unless othe rwise noted) to implement standardized, transparent APIs. Using the API, the se ent ities w ould be required to pr ovi de current enrollees w ith specified c la ims a nd encounter data a nd certain c l inical information if such in formation is ma intained. We proposed tha t these entities would also be required t o make ava ilable through the API information a lready r equired to be widely available, including provider directory and plan coverage information, such as formulary information. In developing the proposal delineating the information that would be required to be made available through an API, consistent with the propose d t echnical re quirements, we were guided by a n intent to have ava ilable through the API all of the individual's electronic h ealth information held by the payer in electronic for mat that is compatible with the API or that can, through automate d means, be form atted to be accurately rendered through the API. We were also guided by an intent to make available through standardized, secure API technol ogy all of the provider di rectory and formulary information maintained by the impacted payers that can be made compatible with the API. CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 40 Both t he API t echnology itself and the dat a it makes available must b e standardized t o suppor t true interoperability. Therefore, as discussed in detail in the proposed rule, we proposed to require compliance with both (1) ONC's 21st Century Cures Act rule proposed regulations regarding content and vocabulary standards for representing electronic health information as finalized and (2) tec hnical standards for an A PI by w hich the electronic h ealth information would be required to be made available as finalized. For the proposals described in section III.C.2.b. of the CMS I nteroperability and Patient A ccess proposed rule (which addr essed t ransmissions for purposes other than those covered by HIPAA t ransaction standards, w ith which all the payers subject to this final rule will continue to be required to comply under 45 CFR part 162), w e proposed requiri ng compliance wit h the interoperabilit y standards propos ed for HHS adopti on in the ONC 21st Cent ury Cures Act proposed rule (84 FR 7424) as finalized. In proposing to re quire t hat regulated e nti ties comply w ith O NC- proposed regulations for non-HIPAA covere d transactions (84 F R 7424) and therefore, requiri ng the use of specified st andards, we noted that we intende d to preclude regul ated entities from implementing API technol ogy using alternative technical sta ndards to those ONC proposed for HHS adoption at 45 CFR 170.21 5, which details the API technical standards, including the use of FHIR. O ther te chnical standards that would be preclude d include, but are not limited to, those not widely used to exchange electronic health informati on in the U.S. health system . We further not ed that we intended to preclude e ntities f rom using earlier versions of the technical standard s adopted at 45 CF R 170.21 5 by requiring compliance with only specified provisions of 45 CFR part 170, and deliberatel y excluding others. We also discusse d how by proposing to require use of the propos ed content and vocabulary standards as finalized by requiri ng compliance wit h 42 CFR 423.160 and 45 CFR part 162, and proposed at 45 CFR 170.213, we intended to prohibit use of CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 41 alternative standards that coul d potentially be used f or these same data classes and elements, as well as earlier versions of the adopted standards named in 42 CFR 423.1 60, 45 CFR part 162, and proposed at 45 CFR 170.213. While we generally intended to preclude regulated entities from using content and vocabulary standards other than those described in 42 CFR 423.160, 45 C FR part 162, or proposed 45 CFR 170.2 13 (and technical standards at 45 CFR 170.215) , we recognized there may be circumstances that render t he use of other cont en t an d voc abulary alternatives necessary. A s discussed below, we proposed t o allow the use of al ternative content and vocabulary standards in two ci rcumstances. F irst, w he re other cont ent o r vocabulary st anda rds ar e expressly ma ndated by applicable law, we proposed to permit use of those other mandated standards. Second, where no appropriate content or vocabulary standar d exists within 45 CFR par t 162, 42 CFR 423.16 0, or proposed 45 CFR 170.213 and 170.215, we proposed we would permit use of any suitable gap-filling options, as may be applicable to the specific situation. We used two sepa rate rulemakings becaus e t he 21st C entury Cures Act pr oposed r ule (84 FR 7424) , which included API interoperability standards proposed for HHS adoption, would have broader r each than the scope of the CMS I nteroperability and Patient A ccess proposed rule (84 FR 7610) . At the same time, we wished to assure stakeholders that the API standards required of MA organizations, s ta te Medicaid ag encies, s tate CHIP age ncies, Med icaid m anaged care plans, CHIP managed car e entities, and QHP issuers on t he FFEs under t he proposal would be consistent with the API standards proposed by ONC for HHS adoption because we would require tha t the regulated e nt ities follow specified, a ppl icable provisions o f the ONC-proposed requirements as finalized. CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 42 Requiring that CMS-r egulated entities comply with the regulations regarding standards finalized by HHS in O NC's 21s t Century C ures Act rule w ill support greate r int eroperability acros s the health care system, as health I T products and applications that would be developed f or different s et tings and use cases would be developed according to a consistent base of standards that supports mor e seamless e xchange of information. In the CMS Int eroperability a n d Patient A ccess proposed rule, we welcome d public comment on our proposal to require c ompliance w ith the standards proposed for adopti on by HHS through ONC's 21st Ce ntury Cures Act proposed rule, as well as on the best method to provide support in identifyi ng and implementing the applicable content and vocabulary standards for a given data element. Finally, while noting that we believed that the proposal to require compliance with the standards proposed by ONC for HHS adoption was the best approach, we sought public comment on any alternative by which CMS would separately adopt the standards proposed for adoption in the ONC 21st Century Cures Act proposed rule and identified throughout the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access proposed rule, as well as future interoperability, content, and vocabulary standards. We stated that we anticipated any alternative would include incorporating by reference the FHIR R2, R3, and/or R4 based on comments and OAuth 2.0 technical standards and the USCDI version 1 content and vocabulary standard (described in sections II.A.3.b. and II.A.3.a. of the CMS Inter operability and Patient Access proposed rule, respectively) in CMS regulation to replace the proposed references to ONC regulations at 45 CFR 170.215, 170.213, and 170.205, respectively. However, we specifically sought comment on whether this alternative would present an unacceptable risk of creating multiple regulations requiring standards or versions of standards across HHS' programs, and an assessment of the benefits or burdens of separately adopting new standards and incorporating updated versions of standards in CFR text CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 43 on a program by program basis. Furthermore, we sought comment on: h ow such an option might impact health IT de velopment timelines; how potentially c re ating multiple regulations regarding standa rds over t ime across HHS m i ght impact syste m imp lementation; and other factors re lated to the technical asp ect o f implementing these requirements. We summarize the public comments we received regarding separately ado pting st andards in this CMS rule and provide our responses. Comment: Many commenters supported CMS' propos ed alignment with the standards proposed i n ONC's 21st Cent ury Cures Act proposed rule to be adopted by HHS to promote interoperability, noting it was the mo s t effective and efficien t approach. Comme nters explained that this a lignment was c ritical to e nsure in teroperability a cross the he alth c are industry, and over whelmingly preferred \"one source of truth\" f or all st andards referenced in th e CMS Interoperability and Patient Access proposed r ule. T he se commenters explaine d having highly technical standards, including content and vocabulary standards, in different CMS and ONC regulations would c reate the pot ential for e rror and misalign ment of standards or versions of standa rds across HHS programs. C ommenter s supported a lignment across agencies, and indicated c oncern th at if the standards w e re adopted in di ffe rent regulations, it would c ompl icate the process of upda ting the standards when necessary, and increase the cost and burden of data capture, data management, and data exchange. Commenters did note oppor tunities for even greater a lignment across t he CMS and ONC r ulemakings at the data element level, i n dicating that the ONC rul e should inc lude all da ta e lements re quired in the CMS r ule, s pecifically c alling out data eleme nts in a n Explanati on of Benefits (E OB) not s pecificall y included i n t he USCDI (proposed for codification at 45 CFR 170.213). CMS 03/06/20 44 Response: We commenters' support for alignment of the regul ations adopted in this fin al rule w ith the standards as finalized by HHS in the ON C 21st Century Cures Act final rule (published elsewhere in t his issue of the Federal Regist er). We agree that the b est way to ensure continue d alignment is to have the regulations we are adopting here - governing MA or ganizations , state Medicaid F FS programs, Medicaid managed c are plans, C HIP F FS programs, C HIP m anaged car e entities, and Q HP issuers on t he FFEs - cross reference the specific regulations codifyi ng the standards adopt ed by HHS in the ONC 21st Century Cures Act final rule. Our intent is to ensure alignment and consistent standards across the regulated programs. We a gree th at this w ill help support interoperability a cross the health care indus try and help set clear and consistent goals for all payers, providers, vendors, and developers. CMS and ONC will continue to coordinate closely on standards , including content and vocab ulary standards and i mpacted data elements and use cases, and w e will con tinue to w or k closely w ith all stakeholders to en sure t ha t this process i s consensus -based. Regardi ng the re commendation to add data elements from the EOB not yet included in the USCDI, we have shared these recommendations with ONC, and we refe r readers to the discussion in ONC's 21st Century Cures Act f inal r ule on the USCDI and the Standards Version Advancement Process (published el sewhere in this issue of t he Federal R egister ). B. Content and Vocabulary Standards The content and vocabulary standards HHS ultimatel y adopts applicable to the data provi ded through the standa rds-based API will, by necessity, vary by use case and w ithin a use case. For instance, content and vocabulary standards supporting consumer access vary according to what spe cific dat a elements MA o rganizations, Medicaid a nd CH IP FFS programs, Medicaid managed care plans, CHIP managed care entities, and QHP issuers on the FFEs have available CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 45 electronically. Where another law does not require use of a specific standard, we proposed to require use of, in effect, a catalogue of content and vocabulary standards fr om which the regulated entities may choose in order to satisfy the proposed requirements in 42 CFR 422.119, 431.60, 457.730, 438.252, and 457.1233, and 45 CFR 156.221. A further discussion of these proposals can be found in section II.B. of the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access proposed rule (84 FR 7623 through 7624). These proposals are detailed in section III.C.2.b. of the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access proposed rule (84 FR 7626 through 7639), and comments received on these proposals are su mmarized with our responses in section III.C.2.b. of this final rule. Specifically, we note that we proposed to adopt the content and vocabulary standards as finalized by HHS in ONC's 21st Century Cures Act final rule (published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register) at 45 CFR 170.213. This standard is currently the USCDI version 1. C.Application Programming Interface (API) Standard In section III.C.2.b. of the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access proposed rule, we proposed to require compliance with the API technical standard proposed by ONC for HHS adoption at 45 CFR 170.215 as finalized (84 FR 7589). By requiring compliance with 45 CFR 170.215, we proposed to require use of the foundational Health Level 7 \u00ae (HL7)19 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources\u00ae (FHIR) standard,20 several implementation specifications specific to FHIR, and complementary security and app registration protocols , specifically the Substitutable Medical Applications, Reusable Technologies (SMART) Application Launch Implementation 19 Healt h Level Seve n I nternational\u00ae (HL7 ) not-for-profit, ANSI- accredite d standards development organization (SDO) focused on developing consensus standards for the exchange, integration, sharing, a nd retrieval of electronic hea lth informati on that supports clinical practice and the management, deliver y a nd evaluati on of health services.

A further discussion of these proposals can be found in section II.C. (84 FR 7624 thr ough 7625) and the propos als are detailed in section III. of the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access proposed rule (84 FR 7626 through 7639). Comments received on these proposals are summarized with our responses in section III. of thi s final rule. We proposed to adopt the technical standards as finalized by HHS in the ONC 21st Century Cures Act final rule (published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register) at 45 CFR 170.215. HHS is finalizing adoption of HL7 FHIR Release 4.0.1 as the foundational standard for APIs at 45 CFR 170.215(a)(1). Instead of the Argonaut IG and server to support exchange of the USCDI proposed at 45 CFR 170.215(a)(3) and (a)(4) (84 FR 7424), HHS is finalizing the HL7 FHIR US Core IG STU 3.1.0 at 45 CFR 170.215(a)(2). The HL7 SMART Application Launch Framework IG Release 1.0.0 was proposed at 45 CFR 170.215(a)(5) (84 FR 7424). HHS is finalizing the HL7 SMART Application Launch Framework IG Release 1.0.0 (which is a profile of the OAuth 2.0 specification), including mandatory support for the \"SMART on FHIR Core Capabilities,\" at 45 C FR 170.215(a)(3). HHS is finalizing as proposed adoption of OpenID Connect Core 1.0, incorporating errata set 1 at 45 CFR 170.215(b), as well as adoption of version 1.0.0: STU 1 of the FHIR Bulk Data Access specification at 45 CFR 170.215(a)(4). HHS is not finalizing the adoption of FHIR Release 2 or FHIR Release 3, API Resource Collection in Health (ARCH) Version 1, or the HL7 Consent2Share FHIR Consent Profile Design that were proposed at 170.215(a)(1), (c)(1), (a)(2), or (c)(2), respectively (84 FR 7424). For a full discussion, see the ONC 21st Century Cures Act final rule (published CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 47 elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register ). The content and vocabulary standards and technical standards finalized by HHS in the ONC 21st Century Cures Act final rule provide the foundation needed to support implementation of the policies as proposed and now finalized in this rule. D. Updates to Standards In addition to efforts to align standards across HHS, we recognized in the proposed rule that while we must codify in regulation a specific version of each standard, the need for continually evolving standards development has historically outpaced our abil ity to amend regulatory text. To address how standards development can outpace our rulemaking schedule, we proposed in section III.C.2.b. of the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access proposed rule (84 FR 7630 through 7631) that regulated entities may use updated versions of required standards if use of the updated version is required by other applicable law. In addition, under certain circumstances, we proposed to allow use of an updated version of a standard if the standard is not prohibited under other applicable law. For content and vocabulary standards at 45 CFR part 162 or 42 CFR 423.160, we proposed to allow the use of an updated version of the content or vocabulary standard adopted under rulemaking, unless the use of the updated version of the standard: is prohibited for entities regulated by that part or the program under that section; is prohibited by the Secretary for purposes of these policies or for use in ONC's Health IT Certification Program; or is precluded by other applicable law. We remind readers that other applicable law includes statutes and regulations that govern the specific entity. For the content and vocabulary standards proposed by ONC for HHS adoption at 45 CFR 170.213 (84 FR 7589) (currently, USCDI version 1), 21 as 21 For more information on the USCDI, see https://www.healthit.gov/USCDI. CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 48 well as for API technical standards proposed by ONC for HHS adoption at 45 CFR 170.215 (84 FR 7589) (including HL7 FHIR and other standards and implementation guides (IGs) as discussed above), 22 we proposed to allow the use of an updated version of a s tandard adopted by HHS, provided such updated version has been approved by the National Coordinator through the Standards Version Advancement Process described in the ONC 21st Century Cures Act proposed rule (84 FR 7424), as finalized. A further discussion of these proposals can be found in section II.D. of the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access proposed rule (84 FR 7625 through 7626). These proposals are also detailed in section III. of the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access proposed rule (84 FR 7626 through 7639), and comments received on these proposals are summarized with our responses in section III. of this final rule. III. Provisions of Patient Access Through APIs, and Analysis of and Responses to PublicComments A. Background on Medicare Blue Button As discussed in the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access proposed rule (84 FR 7626), we are committed to advancing interoperability, putting patients at the center of their health care, and ensuring they have simple and easy access, without special effort, to their health information. With the establishment of the initial Medicare Blue Button \u00ae service in 2010, Medicare beneficiaries became able to download their Part A, Part B, and Part D health care claims and encounter data through MyMedicare .gov in either PDF or text format. While the original Blue Button effort was a first step toward liberating patient health information, we recognized that significant opportunities remain to modernize access to that health information and the ability to share health information across the health ecosystem. We believe that moving 22 For more information on FHIR, see https://www.hl7.org/fhir/overview.html. CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 49 to a system in which pa tients have access t o and use of their health inf ormation will empower them to ma ke be tt er informed de cisions about their health c are. A ddit ionally, interoperability, and the ability for health inf ormation systems a nd software applications to communicate, e xchange, and interpr et health inf ormation in a usable a nd readable for mat, is vi tal to improving hea lth care. Allowing access to hea lth information only through PDF and text formats limit the util ity of and the ability to effectively s hare th e health information. Medicare Blue Button 2.0 is a new, modernize d version of the ori ginal Blue Button service. I t enables beneficiaries to ac cess their M edicare Parts A, B , and D cl aims and enc oun ter data and share that electronic health informati on through an Application Programming Interf ace (API) w ith applications, services, an d research p r ograms they sel ect. A s discussed in section II.A. of the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access proposed rule (see 84 FR 7618 through 7623), API technology allows software from different developers to connect with one another and exchange e le ctronic health information in electronic fo r mats that can be more e asily compil ed an d leveraged by patients and their car egivers. B eneficiaries may also se lect t hird-party applications to compile and leverage the ir electronic he alth in formation to help the m manage their health and engage in a more fully informed way in their health care. Today, Blue Button 2.0 contains 4 years of Medicare Part A, B, and D data for 53 million Medicare beneficiaries. These data are available to patients to help them make more informed decisions. Beneficiaries dictate how their data can be used and by whom, with identity and authorization controlled through MyMedicare.gov. Medicare beneficiaries can authorize sharing their information with an application using their MyMedicare.gov account information. Beneficiaries authorize each application, service, or research program they wish to share their data with individually. A beneficiary can go back to MyMedicare.gov at any time and change the CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 50 way an application uses their information. Using Blue Button 2.0, beneficiaries can access their health information; share it with doctors, caregivers, or anyone they choose; and get help managing and improving their health through a wide range of apps and other computer -based services. Blue Button 2.0 is an optional service - beneficiaries choose the apps and services they want to use. Today, Medicare beneficiaries using Blue Button 2.0 can connect with apps that keep track of tests and services they need and receive reminders, track their medical claims, make appointments and send messages to their doctors, get personalized information about their symptoms and medical conditions, find health and drug plans, keep track of their medical notes and questions, and connect to research projects. 23 These are just some of the ways Blue Button 2.0 is using a standards-based, FHIR-enabled API to lead the charge and unleash the power of health data. B. Expanding the Availability of Health Information 1.Patient Benefits of Information Access As discussed in the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access proposed rule, we believe there are numerous benefits associated with individuals having simple and easy access to their health care data under a standard that is wi dely used. Whereas EHR data are frequently locked in closed, disparate health systems, care and treatment information in the form of claims and encounter data is comprehensively combined in a patient's claims and billing history. Claims and encounter data, used in conjunction with EHR data, can offer a broader and more holistic understanding of an individual's interactions with the health care system than EHR data alone. 23 To review a list of apps currently available to Blue Button 2.0 users, visit https://www.medicare.gov/manage- inconsistent benef it utilizati on patterns in an individual's cla ims data, suc h as a failure to fill a pr escription or receive re commended the rapies, c an ind ic ate tha t the individual has had di fficult y financing a treatment regimen and may require less expensive prescription drugs or therapies, additional explanation about the severity of their condition, or other types of assistance . Identifying and finding opportunities to address the indi vidual's non-adherence to a care plan are critical to keeping people with chronic conditions healthy and engage d so they can avoi d hospitalizations . While a health plan ca n use claims and encounter dat a to help it identify which e nrollees c ould b enefit from an a ssessment of why the y are not filling their pre scriptions or who migh t be at risk for particular pr oble ms, p utting thi s information into the hands of the individual's chosen care provider - such a s the d octor or nurse pr a ctitioner prescribing the medi cations or the pharmacist who fills the p rescriptions - helps them to engage the patient in shared decision making that can hel p address some of the reasons the individual might not be willing or able to ta ke medications as pr escribed. By authorizing the ir providers to access the same information throug h a standards -based A PI, indi viduals can fur ther facilitate communication with th eir care te ams. E nabling the provider to int egrate claims and enc ounter information with E HR data gi ves the provide r the ability to u s e the c ombined inf ormation, with relevant clinical decision support tools, a s part of nor mal care delivery in a le ss burdensome w ay, leadi ng to improved care. This may be particularly important duri ng times of system surge, an event that ge ne rates a large and sudd en de mand for heal th se rvices, f or ex ample, w hen access to such information may help to inform patient triage, transfer, and care decisions. Further, we noted that we believe patients who have immediate electronic access to their health information are empowered to make more informed decisions when discussing their health needs with providers, or when considering changing to a different health plan. We CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 52 discussed that currently not all beneficiaries enrolled in MA plans have immediate electronic access to their claims and encounter data and those who do have it, cannot easily share it with providers or others. The same is true of Medicaid beneficiaries and CHIP enrollees, whether enrolled in FFS or managed care programs, and enrollees in QHPs on the FFEs. As industries outside of health care continue to integrate multiple sources of data to understand and predict their consumers' needs, we believe it is important to position MA organizations, Medicaid and C HIP FFS programs and managed care entities, and QHP issuers on the FFEs to do the same to encourage competition, innovation, and value. We noted that C MS has programmatic authority over MA organizations, Medicaid programs (both FFS and managed care), CHIP (both FFS and managed care), and QHP issuers on the FFEs. We proposed to leverage CMS authority to make claims and encounter data available through APIs as a means to further access for patients in these programs along with other plan data (such as provider directory data) as detailed in sections III.C. and IV. of the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access proposed rule. For a complete discussion of these proposals, see the pro posed rule (84 FR 7626 through 7640). 2. Alignment with the HIPAA Right of Access As discussed in section II. of this final rule, the recent decision in Ciox Health, LLC v. Azar, et al. vacates a portion of the HIPAA Privacy R ule that provides an individual the right to direct a covered entity to send protected health information that is not in an EHR to a third party identified by the individual. I t does not alter a patient's right to request access to their records. In addition, the decision does not affect CMS' programmatic authorities, as discussed in detail in section III. of the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access proposed rule (83 FR 7629 through 7630) and later in this section of this final rule. Prior to this decision, in the CMS Interoperability CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 53 and Patient Access proposed rule, we discussed that the HIPAA Privacy Rule, at 45 CFR 164.524, provides that an individual has a right of access to inspect and obtain a copy of their PHI 24 that is maintained by or on behalf of a covered entity (a health plan or covered health care provider25) in a designated record set.26 It was noted that, at that time, a covered entity was required to provide the access in any readily producible form and format requested by the individual, and that the right of access also includes individual's right to direct a covered entity to transmit PHI directly to a third party the individual designates to receive it. 27 We expla ined that software applications using the Patient Access API proposed at 42 CFR 422.119, 431.60, 438.242(b)(6) (finalized as 438.242(b)(5) in this VI.), 457.730, and 457.1233(d)(2), and 45 CFR 156.221, and further discussed below, would provide an additional mechanism through which the individuals who so choose could exercise the HIPAA right of access to their PHI, by giving them a simple and easy electronic way to request, receive, and share data they want and need, including with a designated third party. However, as discussed in section II. of the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access proposed rule (84 FR 7621 through 7622), due to limitations in the current availability of interoperability standards for some types of health information, or data, we note d the API requirement may not be sufficient to support access to all of the PHI subject to the HIPAA right of access because a patient's PHI may not all be transferable through the API. For instance, we proposed to require payers to make claims and encount er data as well as a specified set of clinical data (that is, clinical data maintained by the applicable payer in the form of the USCDI version 1 data set) available 24 See 45 CFR 160.103, definition of protected health information. 25 The third type of HIPAA covered entity, a health care clearinghouse, is not subject to the same requirements as other covered entities with respect to the right of access. See 45 CFR 164.500(b). 26 See 4 5 CFR 164.501, definition of designated record set. 27 For more information, see https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-p rofessionals/privacy/guidance/access/index.html. CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 54 through the Patient A ccess API. H owever, a patient may r equest ac cess to an X -ray image as w ell. C urrently, the X- ray image itself is not captured under the USCDI version 1 data set, and though the necessary F HIR r esources t o sha re this i nformation via an API like the Patient Access API are a vailable, u se is not required under this ru lemaking and so a payer may not be able to share such informati on via the API. The refore, under our pr oposa l, a HIPAA covered entity would have to share this type of information in a form and format other than the Patient Access API in order to compl y with our program propos als and in keeping wit h the HIPAA Pri vacy Rule right of acc ess. C. Standards-based API Proposal for MA, Medicaid, CHIP, and QHP issuers on the FFEs 1. Introduction We proposed to add new provisions at 42 CFR 422.119, 431.60, 438.242(b)(6) (finalized as VI.), 457.730, 457.1233(d), and 45 CFR 156.221, that would, respectively, require each MA organization, Medicai d FFS program, Medicaid mana ged care plan, CHIP FFS program, CHIP managed care entity, and QHP issuer on an FFE to implement, t est, a nd monitor a s tandards -based A PI that is accessible to third-party applications and developers. We no ted that s tates with C HIPs were not required to ope rate FFS sys tems and that so me states' C HIPs were exclusively ope rated by managed care entities. We did not intend to require C HIPs tha t do not operate a F FS pr ogram to e sta blish a n API; rather, w e no ted tha t these states may rely on each of their contracte d plans, referred to throughout the CMS Interoperability a nd Patient Access proposed r ul e and this final r u le as CHIP m anaged care entities, to set up such a system. As discussed, the API would allow enrollees and beneficiaries of MA organizations, Medicaid and C HIP FFS programs, Medicaid managed care plans, CHIP managed care entities, CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 55 and QHP issuers on the FFEs to exercise their HIPAA right of access to certain health information specific to their plan electronically, through the use of common technologies and without special effort. We explained how \"common technologies,\" for purposes of the proposal, means those that are widely used and readily available, such as computers, smartphones, or tablets. The proposals are detailed in section III.C. of the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access proposed rule (84 FR 7626 through 7639), and comments received on these proposals and our responses are noted below in this final rule. 2. The Standards- based API Proposal In the proposed rule, we addressed the following components of the standards-based API. Specifically, we discussed: Authority to require implementation of a standards-based API by MA organizations, Medicaid and CHIP state agencies, Medicaid managed care plans, CHIP managed care entities, and QHP issuers on the FFEs; The API technical standard and content and vocabulary standards; Data required to be available through the standards- based API and timeframes for data availability; Documentation requirements for APIs; Routine testing and monitoring of standards- based APIs; Compliance with existing pri vacy and security requirements; Denial or discontinuation of access to the API; Enrollee and beneficiary resources regarding privacy and security; Exceptions or provisions specific to certain programs or sub-programs; andCMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 56 Applicability and timing. We also included an RFI on information shari ng between payers and prov iders through APIs. Specifically, we proposed nearl y identical language for the regulations requiring standards- based APIs at 42 CFR 422.119; 431.60, 45 CFR 156.221 for MA organiz ations, Medicaid state agencies, stat e CHIP age ncies, and QHP issuers on t he FFEs; Medicaid managed care plans would be require d, a t 42 CFR 438.242( b)( 6) (finalized as 438.242(b)(5) in this rule; see section VI.), to comply wit h the requirement at 42 CFR 431.60, and CHIP managed care entities would be required by 42 CFR 457.1233( d)(2) to comply with the requirement at 42 CFR 457.730. As discussed in detail in the CMS Interoperability and Patient A ccess proposed rule, w e proposed si milar if not identica l requirements for these va rious enti ties to establish and maintain a standards -based A PI, m ake specified d ata available through that A PI, disclose API documentation, provide access to the API, and m ake resources ava ilable to enrollees. We noted t hat we believed that such nearl y identical text is appropriate as the reasons and need f or t he proposal an d the associated r equ irements are the same acros s t hese programs . We intended to i nterpret and apply the regulations proposed in section III.C. of the CMS Int eroperability a nd Patient Access pr opos ed rul e similarly a nd starting with simila r te xt is an impo rtant s tep to communicate th at to the applicable e n tities tha t would be required to c omply (except as noted below with regard to specific proposals). In paragraph (a) of each applicable proposed regulation, we proposed that the regulated entity (that is, the MA organization, the state Medicaid or CHIP agency, the Medicaid managed care plan, the CHIP managed care entity, or the QHP issuer on an FFE, as applicable) would be required to implement and maintain a standards-b ased API that permits third-party applications to retrieve, with the approval and at the direction of the individual patient, data specified in 57 CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 paragraph (b) of each regulation through the use of common technologies and without special effort from the beneficiary. By \"common technologies and without special effort\" by the enr ollee, we explained that the regulati on means use of comm on consumer technologies, like smart phone s, home computers , laptops, or tab lets, to request , receive, use, and appr ove transfer of the data that would be available through the standards- based A PI technology. By \"without special effort,\" we proposed to codify our expectati on that third- party so f tware, as well as proprietar y applications and web portals operated by the payer could be used to connect to the AP I and provide access to the data to the enrollee. In the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access proposed rule (84 FR 7628 through 7638), we addressed the data that must be made available through the API in paragraph (b); the regulation regardi ng the technical st andards for the API and the data it contains in paragra ph (c); the docume ntation requirements for the API in paragraph (d); explicit authority fo r the payer regulated under each regulation to de ny or dis continue access to the API in paragraph (e); and, requirements for posting information about resources on s ecurity a nd privacy for be neficiaries in pa rag raphs (f) or (g). A dditiona l requirements specific t o certain programs, discussed in sections IV. a nd V. of the CMS Interoperabilit y and Patient Acc ess proposed rule, were also included i n some of the re gulations that address the API. We address those additional requirements in sections IV. and V. of this final rule. a. Authority to Require Implementation of a Standards-based API As noted in the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access proposed rule (84 FR 7629 through 7630), the proposal would apply to MA organizations, Medicaid state agencies and managed care plans, state CHIP agencies and managed care entities, and QHP issuers on the FFEs. We noted that the proposal for Medicaid managed care plans, at 42 CFR 438.242(b)(6) CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 58 (finalized as 438.242( rule; see section VI.), would require MCOs, P IHPs, a nd PA HPs to comply wit h the regulation that we propos ed for Medicaid state agencies at 42 CFR 431.60 as if that regulation applie d to the Medicaid managed ca re plan. Similarly, we intended for CHIP m anaged c are entities to comply w ith the re quireme nt s we proposed at 42 CFR 457.730 via the regulations propose d at 42 CFR 457.1233( d)( 2). We proposed to structure the regulations this way to avoid ambiguity a nd to ensure that th e API proposal would result in consistent access to information for Medicaid beneficiaries and CHI P enrollees, r egardless of whether t hey ar e in a FFS de livery s ystem administered by t he state or in a managed care del ivery system. We noted that CHIP currently adopts the Medicai d requirements at 42 CFR 438.242 i n whole. We proposed revisions to 42 CFR 457.12 33(d)(1) to indicate CHIP's continue d adoption of 42 CF R 438.242(a), (b)(1) through (5), (c), (d), and (e), while we propos ed specific text for CHIP managed care entities to comply with the regulations proposed at 42 CFR 457.1233(d)(2) in lieu of the proposed Medicaid revision, whic h we noted would add 42 C FR 438.24 2(b)(6) (finalize d as \u00a7 438.242(b)(5) in thi s rule; see section VI.). In our discussion of the specifics of the proposal and how we proposed to codify it at 42 CFR 422.119, 431.60, 457.730, and 45 CFR 156.221, we referred i n the CMS Int eroperability and Patient Access proposed rule and refer in this final rule only generally to 42 CFR 438.24 2(b)(5) (proposed as 438.242(b)(6); see section VI.) and 457.1233(d)(2) for thi s reason. (1) Medicare Advantage Sections 1856(b) and 1857(e) of the Social Security Act (the Act) provide CMS with th e authority to add standards and requirements for MA organizations that the Secretary finds necessary and appropriate and not inconsistent with Part C of the Medicare statute. In addition, section 1852(c) of the Act requires disclosure by MA organizations of specific information about CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 59 the plan, covered benefits, and the net work of providers; section 1852(h) of the Act requires MA organizations to pr ovide their enrollees w ith timely access to me dical records and health inf ormati on insofar as MA organi zations maintain such information. The informati on required to be made available unde r these a uthorities th rou gh the APIs in thi s f inal rul e is within t he scope of inf ormation that MA organizations must make available under section 1852(c) and (h) of the Ac t and the impl ementing re gulations at 42 CFR 422.111 and 422.118. A s technology evolves to allow for faster, more e fficient methods of informati on transfer, so do expectations as to what is generally considere d \"timely.\" Thus, w e noted in the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access proposed rule our belief that to align the standards wi th 21st century demands, we must take steps for M A enrollees to ha ve immediate, electronic access to their he alth i nformation and plan information. We further noted that the proposed requirements were intended to achieve this goal by providing patients access to their healt h information through third- par ty apps r etrieve data via the required APIs. The CMS Interoperability and Patient Access proposed rule provisions for MA organizations relied on our authority in sections 1856(b) and 1857(e) of the Act (which provide CMS with the authority to add standards and requirements for MA organizations), and explained how the information to be provided is consistent with the scope of disclosure under section 1852(c) and (h) of the Act, to propose that MA organizations make specific types of information, at minimum, accessible through a standards-b ased API and require timeframes for update cycles. Requirements for the Patient Access API further implement and adopt standards for how MA organizations must ensure enrollee access to medical records or o ther health information as required by section 1852(h) of the Act. Similarly, the Provider Directory API is a means to implement the disclosure requirements in section 1852(c) regarding plan providers. Throughout CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 60 section III.C. of the CMS Int eroperability a nd Patient Access proposed rule, we explained how and why the standards- based A PI pr oposal w as necessary an d appr opriate for MA organizations a nd the MA program . We discusse d how these re quirements would give patients simple and easy access to the ir health information through common technologies, such as smartphones, tablets, or laptop computers, w i thout special effort on the part of th e us er by facilitating the ability of pa tients to g et their health inf ormation from their M A or ganization through a us er-fr iendly thi rd- par ty app. The goals and purposes of achieving interoperability for the health care system as a whole are equally applicable to MA organizations and t heir enrollees. Thus, the discussion in section II. of the CMS I nteroperability and Patient A ccess proposed r ule served to provide fur ther explanati on as to how a sta ndards-base d API proposal is nec essary and appropriate in the MA progr am. In addition, we noted that having easy access to their claims, encounter, and other health information would a ls o fa cilitate be ne ficiaries' ability t o detect and report fraud, waste, and abuse - a critical component of an effective programs. To the extent necessary, we also relied on section 1860D-12(b)(3) of the Act to add provisions specific to the Part D benefit offered by certain MA organizations; that provision incorporates the authority to add program requirements to the contracts from section 1857(e)(1) of the Act. For MA organizations that offer MA Prescription Drug plans, we proposed requirements in 42 CFR 422.119(b)(2) regarding electronic health information for Part D coverage. We explained that this proposal was supported by the disclosure requirements imposed under section 1860D-4(a) of the Act, requiring Part D claims information, pharmacy directory information, and form ulary information to be disclosed to enrollees. Also, we note here that 42 CFR 423.136(d) requires Part D plans to ensure timely access by enrollees to the records and CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 61 information that pertain to them. The APIs in this rule further implement and build on these authorities for ensuring that Part D enrollees have access to information. (2)Medicaid and CHIP We proposed new provisions at 42 CFR 431.60(a), 457.730, 438.242(b)(6) (finalized as 42 CFR rule; see section VI.), and 457.1233( d)(2) that would require states administering Medicaid FFS or CHIP FFS, Medicaid managed care plans, and CHIP managed care entities to implement a standards -based API that permits third -party applications with the approval and at the direction of the benef iciary or enrollee to retrieve certain standardized data. The proposed requirement would provide Medicaid beneficiaries' and CHIP enrollees simple and easy access to their information through common technologies, such as smartphones, tablets, or laptop com puters, and without special effort on the part of the user. For Medicaid, we proposed these new requirements under our authority under section 1902(a)(4) of the Act, which requires that a state Medicaid plan provide such methods of administration as are fo und by the Secretary to be necessary for the proper and efficient operation of the plan, and section 1902(a)(19) of the Act , which requires that care and services be provided in a manner consistent with simplicity of administration and the best interests of the recipients. For CHIP, we proposed these requirements under the authority in section 2101(a) of the Act, which sets forth that the purpose of title XXI is to provide funds to states to provide child health assistance to uninsured, low -income children in an effective and efficient manner that is coordinated wit h other sources of health benefits coverage. Together we noted that these proposals would provide us with authority (in conjunction with our delegation of authority from the Secretary) to adopt requirements for Medicaid and CHIP that are necessary to ensure the CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 62 provision of quality care in an efficient and cost- effective way, c onsistent with s implicity of admi nistration and t he best i nterest o f the beneficiary. We noted that w e believed that requiring state Medicaid and CHIP age ncies and managed care plans/entities to take steps to make Medicaid be neficiaries' and CHIP enrollees' claims, enc ounters, a nd ot her health informati on avai lable through interoperable technology would ultimatel y lead to these enrol lees accessing that informati on in a convenient, timel y, a nd portable way, which is essential f or these p rograms to be effectively a nd efficiently a dministered in the be st interests of beneficiaries. Further, we noted that there are independent statutory provisions that require the disclosure and delivery o f information t o Med icaid b eneficiaries and CHIP enr ollees; the proposal would result in additional implementation of those requirements in a way that is appropriate and necessary i n the 21st century. We also noted that we believe d maki ng this infor mation available in APIs a nd ultima tely a pps ma y result in better heal th outcomes and patient sa tisfaction and improve t he cost ef fectiveness of the enti re health car e system, i nc luding Medicaid and CHIP. Having easy access to their claims, encounter, and other heal th information may al so facilitate benef iciaries' ability to detect and report fraud, waste , and abuse - a critical component of an effective programs. We discussed that as technology has advanced, we have encouraged states, health plans, and providers to adopt various forms of technology to impr ove the accurate and timely exchange of standardized health care information. We noted that the proposal would move Medicaid and CHIP programs in the direction of enabling better information access by Medicaid beneficiaries and CHIP enrollees, which would make them active partners in their health care by providing a way for them to easily monitor and share their data. By requiring that certain information be available in and through standardized formats and technologies, we noted that the proposal CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 63 moved these programs toward interoperability, which is key for data sharing and access, and ultimatel y, improved health outcomes. We also not ed that states woul d be expected to implement the CHIP provisions using CHIP administrative funding, which is limited unde r sections 2105(a)(1)(D)(v) and 2105(c)(2)(A) of the Act to 10 pe rcent of a state's t ot al annua l CHIP expe nditures. (3) Qualified H ealt h Plan Issuers on the Federally -facilitated Exchanges We proposed a new QHP minimum certificati on standar d at 45 CFR 156.221(a ) that would require QHP issuers on the FFEs to imp lement a s tandards -base d API that woul d permit third -party applications , w ith the approval and a t the direction of the individual enrollee, to retrieve standardized da ta as specified in the proposal. W e also proposed to require that the data be made available to QHP enrollees through common technologies, suc h as smartphones or tablets, and without special effort from enrollees. We proposed the new requirements under our authority in section 1311(e)(1)( B) of the Patient P rotection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (Pub. L . 111-148, enacted March 23, 2010, and Pub. L. 111-152, enacted March 30, 2010, respectively) (collectively referred to as the Affordable Care Act), which afforded the Exchanges the discretion to certify QHPs that are in the best interests of qualified individuals and qualified employers. Specifically, section 1311(e) of the Affordable Care Act authorized Exchanges to certify Q HPs that meet the QHP certification standards established by the Secretary, and if the Exchange determined that making available such health plan through such Exchange is in the interests of qualified individuals and qualified employers in the state in which such Exchange operates. CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 64 In the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access proposed r u le, w e noted s pe cifically in our discussion on QHP issuers on the FFEs, but appl icable to all payers impacted by this rule, that w e believe there ar e numerous benefits associated with individuals having access to their health pla n data that is bui lt upon widely used standards. The ability to easily obtain, use, and share claims, enc ounter, and other h ealth d ata enables patients to m ore effectively and easi ly us e the health ca re system. F or example, by being abl e to eas ily access a comprehensive list of their adjudic ated claims, pa tients can ens ure their p roviders know what ser vices they ha ve already received, can avoid receiving duplicate services, and can help their providers verify when prescri ptions were filled. We noted that w e believe the se types of activities would r es ult in b etter he alth ou tcomes and patient satisfaction and improve the cost ef fectiveness of the entire health care system. H aving simple and ea sy access, w ithout special effort, to the ir health in formation, including cost and pa yment information, also facilitates pa tients' ability t o detect and report fraud, waste, and abuse\u2014a critical component of an effective program . We noted that existing a nd emerging technologies provide a path t o make information and resources for he alth and healt h care management univer sal, integrated, equitable, accessible to all, and personally relevant. S pecifically, for QH P i ssuers on t he FFEs, w e stated t hat w e believe genera lly certifying only health pl ans tha t make e nr ollees ' health information avai lable to them in a convenient, timely, and portable w ay is in th e interests of qualified indi viduals and qualified employers in t he state or st ates in which an F FE ope rates. W e also note d we encouraged SBEs to c onsider whethe r a similar requirement should be applicable t o Q HP is suers pa rticipating in the ir Exc hange. We did not receive comments on the authorities discusse d in t his section to implement the Patient Access API. We are finalizing these provisions, with the modifications discussed in CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 65 section III.C. of this rule, unde r this authority. A dditionally, we are making tw o modi fications to the regulation te xt to mo re clearly id e ntify is suers s ubject to the regulation. F irst, w e are m odifying the scope of the applicability of the regulation to issuers on the individual market FF Es, e ffectively e xcluding issuers o ffered th rou gh the FF-SHOP, and we are explicitly e xcluding QHP issuers on the FFEs that only offer SADPs. b. API Technical Standard and Content and Vocabulary Standards We proposed to require compliance with 45 CFR 170.215 as finalized at 42 CFR 422.119(a) and 431.60(a) and (c), 457.730(a) ), 438.242(b)(6) (finalized as 438.242(b)(5) in this rule; see section VI.) and 457.1233(d)(2), and 45 CFR 156.221( a) and (c), so that MA organizations, Medicai d and CHIP FFS progr ams, Medicai d managed care plans , CHIP m anaged car e entities, and QHP issuers on t he FFEs implement st andards -based API technology conformant with the API technical standards finalized by HHS in the ONC 21st Century Cures Act final rule (published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register), as discussed in section II.A.3. of the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access proposed rule and section II. of this final rule. We further proposed to require that the data available th rough the API be in compliance with the regulations regarding the following content and vocabulary standards, w here applicable to the data type or data element, unless an alternate standard is required by other applicable law: standards adopted at 45 CFR part 162 and 42 CFR 423.160; and standards finalized by HHS in the ONC 21st Century Cures Act final rule at 45 CFR 170.213 (USCDI version 1). See section II.A.3. of the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access proposed r ule for further information about how entities subject to this rule would be required to utilize these standards. We proposed that both the API technical standard and the content and CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 66 vocabulary standards would be required across the MA program, Medicaid program , and CHIP, and by Q HP issuers on the FFEs. With the proposed requirements to i mplement and maintai n an API at 42 CFR 422.119( a), 431.60( a), and 457.730(a), we propo sed corresponding requirements at 42 CFR 422.119(c) for MA plans, 431.60(c) for Medicai d FFS programs, and 457.730(c) fo r CHIP FFS programs implementi ng the propose d A PI technology. At propos ed 42 CFR 422.119( c), 431.60(c), and 457.730(c), MA plans and the state Medicai d or CHIP age ncy (for states that operate CHIP FFS systems) would be required to implement , maintain, and use API te chnology conformant with the standards finalized by HHS in the ONC 21st Centur y Cures Act final rule (published e lsewher e in this issue of the F ederal Register ) at 45 CFR 170.215; for data available through the API, to use content a nd vocabulary standards adopted at 45 CFR part 162 and 42 CFR 423.16 0, and finalized at 45 CFR 170.213, unless alternate standards are required by other applicable law; and to ensure that technology functions in compliance with applicable law protecti ng the privacy and security of the dat a, including but not limited to 45 CFR parts 162, 42 CFR part 2, and the HIPAA Privacy and Security R ules. We similarly proposed at 45 CFR 156.221(c) that QHP issuers on the FFEs must implement, maintain, and use A PI technology conf ormant with the API technical standards finalized by H HS in the ONC 21s t Century C ures A ct final rule (published elsew here in t his issue of the F ederal Register ) at 45 CFR 170.2 15; for data available through the API, use content a nd vocabulary standards adopted at 45 CFR part 162 and 42 CFR 423.160, and finalized at 45 CFR 170.213, unless alternate standards are required by other applicable law; and ensure that technology functions in compliance with applicable law protecting the privacy and security CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 67 of the data, including but not limite d to 45 CFR par t 162, 42 CFR part 2, and the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules. We not ed that w e believed these proposals would ser ve to cr eate a health care informati on ecosystem that al lows and encourages the health care market to tailor products and services to b etter se rve and compet e for patients, thereby increasing quality, decreasing cos ts, and empowering patients w ith information that helps them live be tter, he althier lives. A dditionally, under our p roposal, clinicians would be able to review, wit h the approval and at the direction of the pa tient, i nformation on the patient's c u rrent prescriptions and services received by the patient; the patient could also allow clinicians to access such information by sharing data r eceived through the API w ith the clinician's EHR sys t em\u2014by forwarding the information once the patient receives it or by letting the c li nician see the information on the patient's smartphone using an app that received the data through the API. Developers and providers could also explore approache s where patients can au thori ze release of the data through the API directly to the clinician's EHR system. We also encouraged payers to co nsider using the proposed API infrastructure as a means to exchange health information for other health care purposes, such as to health care providers for treatment purposes. Sharing interoperable information directly with the p atient's health care provider in advance of a patient visit would save time during appointments and ultimately improve the quality of care delivered to patients. Most clinicians and patients have access to the internet, providing many access points for viewing health information over secure connections. We noted that we believed these proposed requirements would significantly improve patients' experiences by providing a mechanism through which they can access their data in a standardized, computable, and digital format in alignment with other public and private health CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 68 care entities. We stated t hat w e designed t he proposals to empower pa tients to ha ve simple and easy acc ess to t heir da ta in a usable digital format, and therefore, empower them to de cide ho w their health informati on is going to be use d. However, we reminded payers, and proposed to codif y that the regulation regarding the AP I would not lower or change their obligations as HIPAA c overed e n tities to comply w ith r egulations r egarding standard transactions at 45 CFR part 162. Finall y, we also proposed to add a new MA contract requirement at 42 CFR 422.504(a)(18) specifying that MA organizations must comply with the requirement for access to health data and plan information under 42 CFR 422.119. We summarize the public comments we received on the Patient Access API proposal, generally, and the technical standards we proposed for the API and its content, and provide our responses. Comment: Many commenters indicated support for the overa ll proposal to require the specified payers to provide patients access to their health care inf ormation through a standards- based A PI. T hese commenters supported the goals to p rovide patients near r eal-time, electronic access to the ir claims, t reatment, a nd qua lity inf ormation. Many c ommenters w e re also s upportive of provider access to patient data through APIs, if the patient consente d to (or aut horized) access , in order to support coor dinated care. One com menter w as specifically i n favor of the patient access pr oposa l not ing it supports pa tie nt access to their historical c laims information. Finally, one commenter requested that CMS explain whether \"API technology\" has the same definition as in the ONC propos ed rule. Response : We appreciate the commenters' support for the Patient Access API proposal and are finalizing this policy with modifications, as discussed in detail below. We also note that CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 69 both the CMS and ONC rules use the term \"API\" consistentl y as we work together to align t echnol ogy and standards and for ward interoperability across the entire health care system. We do note, however, that the Patient Access API did not propose to include quality information. Comment: One commenter r equested C MS specify the historical look -ba ck period for AP I exchange. In addition, one commenter requested that CMS not require da ta older than f rom 2019 be made available through APIs due t o the implementation costs of standardizing older information. Response : We appr eciate the commenters' suggestions. The proposed rule did not specify a historical look-back pe riod for the Patient Access A PI or limit the timeframe of the data th at mus t be available through the API. To ensure c on sistent implementation and mini mize the burden on payers, we are finalizi ng additional text in th e applicable regulations to specif y that MA orga nizations at 42 CFR 422.11 9(h), state Medicaid FFS programs at 42 CFR 431.60( g), Medicaid managed care plans at 42 CFR 438.62 (b) (1)(vii) , CHIP FFS pr ograms at 4 2 CFR 457.730( g), CHIP managed care entities at 42 CFR 457.1233( d), and QHP issuers on the FFEs at 45 CFR 156.221(i), beginning January 1, 2021 (or plan years beginni ng on or after January 1, 2021 for QHPs on the FFEs), must make available through the Patient A ccess API da ta that they maintain with a date of service on or after January 1, 2016. This means that no information with a date of service earlier than Januar y 1, 2016 will need to be made avai lable through the Patient Access API. B y \"da te of service,\" we mean the date the patient r eceived t he item or service, regardless o f when it was pa id fo r or or dered. This is c onsistent with how we are finalizing the payer- to-payer data exchange requirement for MA organizations at 42 CFR 422.119( f), Medicaid managed care plans at \u00a7 438.62(b)(1)(vi) (made applicable to CHIP managed care entities through incorporation in \u00a7 457.1216), and QHP issuers on 156.221(f). CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 70 Aligning the years of data available through the Patient Access API with the payer- to-payer data exchange will minimize cost and burden specific to this regulatory requirement and will provide patients with the same timeframe of information as payers, furthering transparency. Together these policies facilitate the creation and maintenance of a patient's cumulative health record with their current payer. We do not believe limiting the Patient Access API to data only from January 1, 2019 forward is sufficient to help patients most benefit from this data availability. However, we do appreciate that making older data available for electronic data exchange via the Patient Access API is part of the cost of the API. As a result, limiting this to data with a date of service of January 1, 2016 forward minimizes cost and burden while maximizing patient benefit. Comment : A few commenters expressed concerns and indicated that they did not believe the Patient Access API proposal would move the health care industry toward the stated goal of helping patients make more informed care decisions. Seve ral commenters were concerned that certain patient groups, such as those with low technology access and/or health literacy, would not make use of electronic applications for making health care decisions. A few commenters recommended CMS not limit patient a ccess to health information through apps alone, especially for populations with low technology access and/or literacy. Response : We appreciate the commenters' concerns. However, more and more Americans are using portable technology like smart phones and tablets to conduct a myriad of daily activities. Approximately 81 percent of U.S. adults reported owning a smartphone and 52 percent reported owning a tablet computer in 2019. 28 An American Community Survey Report 28 Pew Research Center. (2019, June 12). Retrieved from https://www.pewinternet.org/fact-s heet/mobile. CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 71 from the U.S. Census Bureau reported that in 2016, 82 percent of households reported an internet subscription and 83 percent reported a cellular data plan.29 People have a right to be able to manage their health information in this way should they choose. We appreciate that not everyone is comfortable with, has access to, or uses electronic applications in making health care decisions. Such patients will maintain the same access that they have to their personal health information today. This regulation does not change any existing patient information rights. This regulation simply adds new options to ensure patients have the information they need, when, and how they need it. Comment : Several commenters indicated concerns over what they believe would be a costly implementation. A few commenters questioned who would be required to bear the costs of implementation and maintenance of the APIs, with one commenter requesting CMS explicitly permit payers to charge patients and other third -party partners for the costs of API implementation and maintenance. I n contrast, a few commenters recommended that payers should not be allowed to charge patients to access their information through APIs. A few commenters requested CMS provide federal grant funding to support payers in implementing the proposed APIs. Response : We appreciate the commenters' concerns and recommendations. As discussed in section XIII. of this final rule, we are providing updated cost estimates for implementing and maintaining the Patient Access API, moving from a single point estimate to a r ange - including a low, primary, and high estimate - to better take into account the many factors that impact the cost of implementation. We have revised our original estimate of $788,414 per payer, to a 29 Ryan, C. (2018). Computer and Internet Use in the United States: 2016 (American Community Survey Reports, ACS-3 9). Retrieved from https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2018/acs/ACS-3 9.pdf. CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 72 primary estimate of $1,576,829 per payer, increasing our original estimate by a factor of 2 to ac count for additiona l information th at was pr ovided b y commenters, w hi ch w e still believe is relatively minimal in relation t o the overall budge t of these impacted payers. We have included a low estimate of $718,414.40 pe r organization, and a high estimate of $2,365,243 per organization. W e refer readers to sections XII. and X III. of this fin al rule f or a de tailed discussion of our r evised cos t estimates. We acknowledge that pa yers may p ass the se costs to pa tients via inc reased pr emiums. In thi s way, patients could absorb the cost of the API. However, we note the costs of \"premiums\" for MA, Medicai d, and CHIP enrollees are primarily borne by the gove rnment, as are some premium costs for enrollees of QHP issuers on the FFEs who receive premium tax c redits. We be lieve that the benefit s created by t he Patient A ccess API o utweigh the costs to p atients if payers choose to i ncrease premiums as a result. At this t ime, w e are not able to o ffe r support for the imp lementatio n of this policy through federal grant funding. Regarding costs for Medicai d managed care plans - since the Patient A ccess API r equirements must be contractual obl igations under t he Medicaid m anage d care contract - t he stat e must include the se costs i n the development of a pl an's capitation rates. These capitation rates would be matched at the state's medical ass istance m at ch rate. State Medicaid agency implementation costs would be shared by the state and federal gove rnm ent, based on the relevant lev el of Federal F inancial Participation, which is 50 percent for general administrative costs and 90 percent for system development costs. Comment : A few commenters described concerns with the maturity of APIs for data exchange, as well as the fact that implementation of FHIR-based APIs is so new in health care, and expressed that they believed there were challenges with meeting the proposed requirement CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 73 given the newness of the needed standards, particularly regarding standardizi ng the required data elements and voc abularies. Several commenters were concerned that APIs would not be implemented in a standardize d fashion, which could lea d to interoperability challenges, and note d the need for testing for certain use cases, such as exchanging data from plan t o patients and from plan-to -plan, as well as the exchange of provider directory and/or pharmacy/formulary information. Several commenters suggested CMS and/or HHS publish implementation guides to support consistent and standardized implementation of FHIR- based A PIs and their ass ociated data standards. Response : We a ppreciate the c ommenters' concerns. A s stated in s e ction II. of this final rule, the content and vocabulary standards and technical standards HHS is finalizing in the ONC 21st Century Cures Act final rule (published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register) provide the foundation needed to support implementation of the policies as proposed and now finalized in this rule. That said, we have been working with HL7 and other industry partners to ensure the implementation guides requested are freely available to payers to use if they choose to use them. Use of these implementation guides is not mandatory; however, if a payer does choose to use the publicly available guidance, it will limit payer burden and support consistent, interoperable API development and imple mentation. Therefore, use of this publicly available guidance can help address the consistency concerns raised. Part of the development process of any implementation guide is consensus review, balloting, and testing. We are providing a link to specific implementations guides and reference implementations for all interested payers for both the Patient Access API and the Provider Directory API (discussed in section IV. of this final rule) that provide valuable guidance to further support sharing the needed data using the required standards: https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Guidance/Interoperability/index . CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 74 The implementation guides provide informati on payer s can u se to meet t he requirements of the pol icies being finalize d in this rule without having to develop an approach independently, saving time and resources. I n addition, t he referenc e implementations allow payers to s ee the APIs in action and support tes ting and development. Comment : A few commenters ind i cated c oncerns w ith a n impending p roliferation of multiple health plan APIs. Instead, commenters recommended a centralized, standardized approach where CMS would require the use of Blue Button 2.0 as the platfor m for providing patie nt access to the ir health da ta from all impacted pr ograms (M edicare Advantage, Medicaid, CHIP, and QHPs on the FFEs). Commenters suggeste d this would also reduce the burde n on app developers to develop to one API rather than multiple A P Is fo r various re g ulated entities. One commenter requested CMS implement a pilot program for the API proposals , citing CM S' Blue Button pilot. One commenter suggested CMS convene a group of 10-12 subject matter experts fro m payers a long with ot her relevant stakeholders, such as developers , to meet wi th CMS, ONC, and the FTC to facilitate a smooth pat h to the API com pliance deadline and ensure a successful implementation. Response: We appreciate the commenters' concerns and recommendations. However, we do not wish to require use of the Blue Button 2.0 platform as a centralized solution. We believe that industry will best have the ability to take interoperability to the next level by leading the development of APIs that meet the requirements in the regulations at 42 CFR 422.119, 431.60, 438.242, 457.730, and 457.1233, as well as CFR 156.221, and which they maintain and co ntrol. Blue Button is essentially the hub for the Medicare data that CMS, as a payer, is making available to our beneficiaries. We do not wish to require the centralization of other payer data under this rule. We are requiring other payers to also unleash their data and CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 75 provide the same benefits to t heir en rollees in a standardized way. As noted above , we are pr ovidi ng a link to s pecific i mplementation guides a nd reference imp lementations to further suppor t implementation of the Patient Access A P I, as well as the Provider D ire ctory A PI (discussed i n section IV . of this fin al rul e), for a ll pa yers to u se: https://www.cms.gov/Regulations- and-Guidance/Guidance/Interoperability/index. U se of th ese freely a vailable ma terials is not required, but if used w ill reduce de velopment burden for both payers and app developers and fa cilitate industry- wide interoperability. A lthough we appreciate the recommendati on to consider a pilot , we believe it is important to move ahead w ith APIs a t this time to he lp the health c a r e sector as a w hol e - including patients, providers and payers - s tart to be nefit from this technology as so ma ny other sect ors have. Also, a s previously noted in this final rule, we will share lessons learned and best practices from our e xperience wi th Blue Button as relevant and appropriate to aid the successful implementation of the A PI requirements in cluded in thi s final rule. Regarding the request t o conve ne subject m atter experts, w e r eiterate our commitment to c ontinuing our collaboration with our federal partners and a diversity of in dustr y stakeholders to ensure a s uccessful and smooth i mplementation of the requirements inc luded in th is final rule. As thi s collaboration is ongoing, we do not believe it is necessary t o convene a new, dedicated group. Comment: One commenter recommended t hat CMS consider standards to allow payers and providers to upload patient data directly to a patient portal that is owned and managed by the patient. One commenter suggested that Health In formation Exchanges (HIEs) and Health Information Networks (HINs) can be a central source for patients to obtain aggregated data in a single location. CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 76 Response : We thank commenter s f or these recommendations. We appreciate that H IEs and HINs can provide patients with valuable information, a nd we look forward to innovative s olutions from this community. One option would be to leverage APIs and support patient access via this technology. We did not propose to use a portal approach. One of the advantages of an API appr oach i s that any system can make data available and t hat d ata can be used by any other system that is followi ng the same approach t o m apping and transporting data wit hout a need to otherwi se link the systems or ensure any sys tem-level compatibility. Having APIs that can be accessed by third-party apps permits the patient to choos e how t he y want to acce ss their da t a, and it promotes innovation in industry to find ways to best help patients interact with their data in a way tha t is mo st meaningful and helpfu l to them. T hi s s ame f lexibility a nd interoperability is not easily realized through a portal solution, and thus we will not cons ider this recommendation at this t ime. Com ment: A few com menters requested CMS confirm the proposed preclusion policy for versions of standards and standards themselves at 42 CFR 422.119( c)(4) for MA or gani zations, for Medicaid FFS programs, 42 CFR 438.242(b)(5) for Medicaid managed care plans, 42 CFR 457.730(c)(4) for CHIP FFS programs, 42 CFR 457.1233(d)(1) for CHIP managed care entities, and 45 CFR 156.221(c)(4) for QHP issuers on t he FFEs. T hese commenters recommended CMS indicate that the preclusion policy woul d prohibit plans fr om using standards not named by CMS for the specified API functions, but would not prohibit them from using those standards for other use cases not regulated by CMS. Response : We confirm that the requirements in this regulation will not preclude a payer from using a standard not finalized in this rule for use cases that are not specifically discussed in this final rule as required for u se with the Patient Access API requirement or the Provider CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 77 Directory A PI requirement (discussed in s ection IV. of this final rule). T he content and vocabulary standards being adopted are specifically applicable to the data identified and required to be made available through the Patient Access A PI and Provider D irectory A PI; this means that if there is a content standard ide ntified in the regulation text for the information spec ified in the re gulati on text as required to be ma de available through the API, t he payer subj ect to the regulation must m ake available through the API a t least t hese data elements using the named content standard. This fi nal rule ind icates the minimum data that mus t be made available vi a these APIs. This does not prevent a payer f rom including mor e information vi a e ither API using other available standards. We do strongly support the continued use and adoption of FHIR standards for addi tional use cases to promote interoperability and efficient and effective transfer of electronic he alth informati on, ge nerally. Comment : A few commenters expressed con cerns that cont racts between he alth care providers and payers need to be standardized in order to support the requirements of the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access proposed r ule. A f ew additional commenters specifically note d that timing requirements for maki ng information available through APIs should be specified in these contracts. O ne commenter r equested C MS prohibit pa yers from using t he Patient A ccess API r equirements to p lace add i tional contractual demands on healt h care providers. Response : We appreciate the commenters' concerns that there will be downstream impacts from the Patient Access API requirements on the relationship between payers and their contracted health care providers. It will be up to each payer's discretion to address whether this information needs to be included in contracts with providers. We do not believe it is necessary or appropriate for CMS to adopt regulations to standardize all contracts between payers and health CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 78 care providers to accomplish this and are not convinced it woul d be wise to try to do s o as each pa yer is un ique, a s are the ir relationships with th eir contracted pr oviders. We a re finalizing the implementation timeline w ith modi fications fro m the pr oposal, as further discussed below, to provide payers and provider s more time to add ress all i mplementation issues. We do not anticipate th is will c reate s ignifican t additional provider burden. Comment: Several commenters supporte d the CMS propos al to adopt FHIR as the technical s tandard f or payer A PIs. S everal commenters recommended adopting FHIR R elease 4 (R4), a lso re ferred to a s \"version 4,\" noting it is more robu st than R elease 2 (R 2) , particularly regarding la boratory inf orma tion. A few other comme nt ers supporte d the use of FHI R R2 with the eventual transition t o R4. One comm enter indicated their recommendation on the version of FHIR to adopt (R2 vs R4) would depend on the timeline CMS provides payers for compliance. A few commenters also su ggested CMS a lign with the version of FHIR tha t O NC a dopt s in it s final rule. Response : We thank commenter s f or their r ecommendations, w hich w e have shared with ONC. We are adopti ng the standards as finalize d by HHS in ONC's 21st Cent ury Cures Act final rule (publ ished el sewhere in t his issue of the Federal Register) . As a result, t h e regulations we are finalizing will require the use of the standards identified at 45 CFR 170.215, which specificall y include the use of HL7 F HIR Release 4.0.1. As previously stated, w e believe that requiring regulate d entities to comply with the spec ified standards regulations finalized by HHS in ONC's 21st Century Cures Act final rule (published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register) will support greater alignment and interoperability across the health care system, as health IT products and applications that will be developed for different settings and use cases will be developed according to a consistent base of standards that support a more seamless CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 79 exchange of information. Extending the imp lementation date, as further discussed below, should provide the necessary time to build to and use FHIR Release 4.0.1. Comment: Although many commenters were generally i n support of the propos al to use FHIR, seve ral com menters did raise specific implementation conc erns. Several commenters expresse d concerns about the co sts and burden for payers and providers to update to the necessa ry FHIR st e spe cially for historical d ata that m ay not cur rently be coded to support FHIR. Many of these commenters cautioned CMS from proceeding too quickl y with FHIR adopti on and implementation. One comm enter noted that semantic interoperability is n ee ded for true in teroperability but that significant mapping and imple mentation efforts would be needed t o ach ieve this goal. O ne commenter r equested C MS provide federal funding to support adoption a nd implementation of FHI R-based A PIs. Response : We appreciate the commenters' conc erns. R ega rding the readiness of the F HIR standards and the need f or semantic interoperability, w e agree that sem antic interoperability is important. As noted in this section, t hough not require d f or use, we ar e providi ng a link to specific implementation guides and reference implementations that include information about the FHIR resources to use t o code and map the re quired data elements as to facilitate interoperable data exchange via the Patient Access A PI, as well as the Provider Dire ctory A PI (discussed in s ection IV. of this fi nal rule). T his addresses the concern raised regarding semantic interoperability. Regarding burden, as indicated in section XIII. of this final rule, we do not anticipate that upgrading to HL7 FHIR Release 4.0.1 and preparing historical data for electronic transfer via an API using the se standards will be more than a relatively minimal expense. We ar e also limiting the amount of historic information that will need to be included in the Patient Access API to CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 80 informati on with a date of se rvice on or after January 1, 2016. This should als o help addr ess conc erns around expense and burden. In addition, we note the discussion below regarding the implementation date for this policy appreciati ng the commenters' con cerns about moving too quickly. Regarding federal funding and costs, we note that for seve ral of the types of payers that must comply w ith the Patient Access A P I requirements, the re is s ignificant federal participation in the costs. For Medicaid F FS, t he provision of enhanced f ed eral match r ate is addressed i n sec tion 1903( a)(3)(A) of the Act and pr ovides a 90 percent match rate for the sums expended during such quarter as are attributable to the design, development, or installati on of such mechanized cl aims processing and i nformation retrieval sys tems as the Secretary de termine s are likely to provide more efficient, economical, and effective administration of the plan. For Medicaid managed c are plans, si nce the Patient Access API r equirements must be contractual obligations under the Medicaid managed care contract, the costs must be included in the development of a plan's capitation rates. Approved capitati on rates would be ma tched at the state's medical assistance match rate. As is discussed in section XIII. of this final rule, MA organizations may include in their bids the costs of implementing provisions of this rule that pertain to MA. The bid, as compared to the benchmark, is a significant component of what the government pays MA organizations for the provision of Part A and Part B benefits: (1) for bids at or below the benchmark, the government pays the bid as the capitation amount, and (2) for bids that are above the benchmark, the government pays the benchmark and the remainder of the bid amount is the premium charged to enrollees of the plan. CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 81 For CHIP, the federal government p ays an enh anced f ederal medical as sistance percentage (EFMAP) t o states for all cos ts associated w i th CHIP, i ncluding systems costs. F or fe deral FY 2020, the EFMAPS will range from approximately 65 to 81.5 percent. We note that states will b e expected t o implement the CH IP provisions using CHIP administrative funding, which is limited under section 2105(a)(1)(D)(v) and 2105(c)(2)(A) of the Act to 10 percent of a state's total annua l CHIP expenditures. For QHP issuers on the FFEs, we would expect that issue rs would raise pr emiums in the short term in order to cover the costs associated with developing and implementing these new standards. T o the extent that p remiums ar e raised f or all QH P i ssuers on the FFEs, f ederal contributions for the subsidized populati on in th e for m of advanced pr emi um tax c redits w ill increase pr oportionally in thos e initial years. N on-subsidized cons umer s will be expected to p ay f or the increase in pr emi ums themselves and any i ncre ases may i mpact t he ability o f some consumers to affor d coverage. Some consum ers may instea d select other options or opt out of coverage if they find QHPs unaffordable. Comment: A few commenters indicated they did not support CMS' proposal to use one standard adopted by HHS (FHIR, which ONC had proposed for adoption at 45 CFR 170.215) as the foundational standard for standards-b ased APIs. A few commenters suggested CMS p ermit the use of other standards for exchanging the proposed patient data during a transition period or until the FHIR standards are more mature. One commenter recommended the use of HIPAA Administrative Simplification transaction standards such as those maintained by X12. One commenter noted that these HIPAA transaction standards were more accessible to payers to represent c linical and case management data. This commenter suggested CMS should precisely identify the specific claims data layout of the HIPAA Administrative Simplification transaction CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 82 standards that payers would be required to generate and receive because the HIPAA Administrative Simplification transaction standards layout varies by payer type. However, one commenter noted that patients may not find information available through HIPAA standards useful. A few commenters suggested C MS shoul d ass ist af fected pa ye rs with meeting the techni cal implementation re quir ements by explaining the intent of the re qui red us e of the H IPAA A dministrative Simplification tra nsaction content and vocabulary s ta ndards w ith the HL7 F H IR standards. C ommenter s recommended t hat C MS review and reconcile differences between existing standards that are required for Medicaid programs, i n particular. For exam ple, commenters suggeste d identifying situations in which CMS has requi red the use of X12 Electronic Data Interchange standards and reconciling these requiremen ts with the adoption of the HL7 FHIR standards. Response : We appreciate the commenters' conc er ns and recommendations. T he policies include d in this final rule ar e not intended to alter HIPAA requirements in any way, and these electronic data exchanges are no t defined transactions under HIPAA regulations, therefore there is no nee d to reconcile use of X12 a nd the HL7 FHIR standards required in this rule. We apprec iate that the HIPAA st andards are more known to m a ny payers at this time; ho wever, w e believe the use of FHIR standards is important for advanci ng the policies finalized i n t his rule, w hich require the transmission of information beyond what is available using X12 standards alone. A t the sam e time, as discussed i n the proposed r ule, w e are requiring e ntities s ubject to this rule to use HIPAA content and vocabulary standards at 45 CFR part 162 where required by other app licable law, or where such standards are the only available standards for the data type or element (84 FR 7623). The use of the FHIR standard supports making this information available CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 83 through a n API. This is not in c onflict with the use of other standards to represent the data being transmitte d through the API. Instead, the FHI R standar d can be thought of as def ining an envelope, while the contents of the envelope can be represented by different cont ent and vocabulary standards used in conjunction with FHIR to make data interoperable and accessible. For additional information on F HIR standards, w e direct commenters to the ONC's 21s t Cent ury Cures Act final rule (published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register ). To support implementation of the policies included in this final rule, we are providing a link to specific imple mentation guides and reference implementations that provide valuable guidance to further support sharing the needed data using the required standards: https://www.cms.gov/Regulations- and-Guidance/Guidance/Interoperability/index. As discussed in secti on II.A.3. of the CM S Interoperability and Patient Access proposed rule (84 FR 7622 through 7623), w e recognized t hat w hile we must cod ify in regulation a spec ific version of each standar d, the need for continually evolving standards devel opment has historicall y outpaced our abil ity to amend regulations. To address how sta ndards development can outpace our rulemaking schedule, we offered several proposals. We p ropose d that regulated entities may use an upda ted ve rsion o f a standard where required by other applicable law. We al so proposed that regulated entities may use an updated version of the st andard where not prohibited by other applicable law, under certain circumstances. W e summarize the public comments we receive d on our approach to allowing voluntary adoption of updated standards and provide our responses. Comment: A few commenters expressed support for the proposal to allow plans to upgrade to newer versions of standards supporting data classes in the USCDI as standards evolve. A few commenters specifically supported the proposal to align with ONC's proposed CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 84 Standards Version Advancement P r ocess and allow pa ye rs to adopt new er ve rsions of FHIR once approved f or use by H H S. A few commenters were concerned w ith backwards compatibility if implementers - payers a nd developers - are permitted t o move to new versions of standards, while a few commenters supporte d the propose d r equirement to maintain com patibility with adopted standards while upgrading to newer standards. One commenter expresse d concerns with difficulty tracki ng c ompliance wit h standards as they move through different ve rsions, ge nerally, and requested C MS est ablish a versioning system o r identif ier for consistency and transparency. A few commenters specifically discussed the NCPDP S CRIPT st andard; how ever, these comments are out of scope for this rulemaking becaus e this rulemaking does not app ly to ePrescribing transactions. Response: We appreciate the commenters' input. We are adopting the ability to use updated standards. As proposed, implementers will need to ensure that use of the updated (or newer) standard (instead of the standard specified in the applicable regulation) does not disrupt an end user's ability to access the data available through the API, which should address concerns raised around backward compatibility. Specifically, we are finalizing at 42 CFR 422.119(c)(4) for MA organizations, 42 CFR 431.60(c)(4) for Medicaid FFS programs, 42 CFR 438.242(b)(5) for Medicaid managed care plans, 42 CFR 457.730(c)(4) for CHIP FFS programs, 42 CFR 457.1233(d)(1) for CHIP managed care entities, and 45 CFR 156.221(c)(4) for QHP issuers on the FFEs permission to use an updated version of standards adopted at 45 CFR 170.215, 45 CFR 170.213, 45 CFR part 162, or 42 CFR 423.160, subject to the conditions proposed. As long as use of the updated version of a standard is not otherwise prohibited, permitted in accordance with CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 85 the conditions described, and, does not disrupt an end user's ability to access the data per the requirements of the API, it may be used. Regarding the recommendation for CMS to establish a versioning system or identifier, we appreciate this recommendation and will review the sugge stion for future consideration. c. Data Required to be Available Through the Standards- based API & Timeframes for Data Availability We proposed the content that m ust b e accessibl e for each enr ollee of an e nti ty sub ject t o t he standards- based API proposal as set out at proposed paragraph (b) of 42 CFR 422.119, 431.60, and 457.730, and 45 CFR 156.221; as noted previously, the regulations for Medicaid m anaged ca re plans and CHIP m anaged care entities cross -re ference and incorporate the regulations we proposed for Medicaid and CHIP FFS programs. We noted that the types of content proposed w ould re present th e min imum t hreshold for compliance; a t their discretion, MA organizations, state Medicaid and CHIP FFS programs , Medicaid managed care plans, CHIP ma naged care entities, and QHP issuers on the FFEs would have the option to use the API required by the propose d rule to make additional types of health information or plan information available, exceeding these minimum requirements. We requested comment on the data proposed to be made available as detailed in the subsections below. We proposed that MA organizations, Medicaid and CHIP FFS programs, Medicaid managed care plans, CHIP managed care entities, and QHP issuers on the FFEs permit third-party applications to retrieve, with the approval and at the d irection of an enrollee, certain specific data: adjudicated claims data, including provider remittances and beneficiary or enrollee cost-s haring data; encounter data from capitated providers; and clinical data, including laboratory r esults (but only if maintained by the payer). CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 86 (1) Patient Claims and E ncounter Data We proposed that the adjudicated claims data require d to be provide d i nclude approved a nd denied claims. Under the proposal, adjudicated claims data includes that for which the plan has made an initial payment decision even when the peri od during which an e nrollee can f ile an a ppeal is still in effect, or when the enrollee has filed a n appeal and is aw aiting a decision on that appeal. Such appeal decisions might be called reconsiderations, reconsidered decisions, organization determinations, or use other te rms, b ut the t erm i s not relevant. We specifically requested c omments f rom plans regarding the feasibility o f including such c laims da ta , inc luding a ny possible timing issues. The proposal included t i meframe requirements for making these various c ategorie s of da ta available through the standards- ba sed A PI. For MA organizations, proposed 42 CFR 422.119(b)(1)(i), (i i), and (b) (2)(i) would re qu ire standards -based API access to a ll claims activity pertaini ng to standardized adjudicated claims (inc luding cost, s pecifically pr ovider rem ittanc es and enrollee cos t-shar ing) and standardized enc ounter da ta for be nefits covered by the plan (that is, Med icare Part A and Part B items and services, P art D pr escription drugs if covered by the MA plan, and any supplemental benefits) no later than one (1) busine ss day after a claim i s processed or the encounter da ta are received by t he MA organization. We used the terms \"adjudicated\" and \"processed\" interchangeably in thi s context. For Med icaid state agencies and managed care plans, we proposed that standardized claims data and encounter data would be required (specifically at 42 CFR 431.60(b)(1) and (2)) through the API no later than one (1) business day after the claim is processed or the data are received. For State Medicaid agencies in connection with the FFS program, we explained that the API would have to include all claims data concerning adjudicated claims and encounter data CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 87 from providers (o ther than M COs, P IH Ps or PAHPs) that are pa id us ing capitated pa yments. T he re quirement for Medicaid managed care plans to provide encounter dat a is specifie d, in conj uncti on with the incorporation of the Med icaid FFS requirement into the Medicaid managed care regulations, at 42 CFR 438.242( b)(6)(i) (finalize d as \u00a7438.242(b) (5)(i) in thi s rule; see section VI.). S i milarly, we proposed t hat en counter da ta that Medicaid m anaged ca re plans must make available through the API would include any data from subcontractors and providers compensated by the managed care plan on the basis of capitation payments, such as behavioral health o rganizations, de ntal management organizations, and pharmacy b enefit m anagers. T he API f or Med i caid managed care plans would ha ve to i nc lude all claims and, therefore, encounter data that would be included rega rdless if it is adjudicated or generated b y the managed care plan i tself, a subcontractor, or a provider compensate d on the basis of capitation payments . All data w ould need to be obtained in a timely manner t o comply with thes e proposed requirements that these types of data be available through the API no later t han one (1) business dat a af ter a claim is processed or the encounter data are received. For CHIP agencies and managed care entities, access to standardized claims data and encounter data would be required (specifically at 42 CFR 457.730(b)(1) and (2)) through the API no later than one (1) business day after the claim is processed or the encounter data are received. The proposal for CHIP state agencies (regarding FFS programs) and CHIP managed care entities is identical to the proposal for Medicaid state agencies (regarding FFS programs) and Medicaid managed care plans. For QHP issuers on the FFEs, the proposed regulation at 45 CFR 156.221(b) would require claims and encounter data to be available through the Patient Access API no later than one (1) business day after adjudication or receipt, respectively. CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 88 Specificall y at 45 CFR 156.221( b)(1)(i) and (ii), we propos ed to require that QHP is suers participating on the FFEs make available through the API standardized da ta concerning adjudicated c laims (including cost) and standardized enc ounter data. Under proposed paragra ph (b)(1)(i), we propos ed that QHP issuers on the FFEs would be required t o make available st andardized data concerni ng adjudicated claim, provider remittance, and e nrollee cost-sharing da ta through the API within one (1) business day a fte r the c laim is processe d. Under propos ed paragraph (b)(1)(ii) , we proposed tha t QHP issuers on the FFEs would be require d to provide standardize d e ncounter data th rough the API no later than one (1) business day after the data are received by the issuer. As discussed in the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access proposed rule (84 FR 7632 through 7633), the proposed ti meframe - making the data available to the third-party app with the approval and at the direction of the patient through the API no later than one (1) business day after processing a claim or receiving encounter data - would ensure that data provided to the third-party app, and ultimately the patient, through the API would be the most current data available. Providing the most current data may be critical if the data are provided by an enrollee to his or her health care provider to use in making clinical decisions. As proposed, the claims and encounter data to be disclosed would include information such as enrollee identifiers, dates of service, payment information (provider remittance if applicable and available), and enrollee cost- sharing. Our proposal did not exclude any elements from the claims and encounter - or the clinical d ata - required to be made available through the Patient Access API. The ability for enrollees - created and facilitated by the API required under the proposal - to access this information electronically would make it easier for them to take it with them as they move from payer to payer or among providers across the care continuum. CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 89 Regarding the provision of encounter data through the API no later than one (1) business day af ter receivi ng the data, we note d that the proposal would mean that a payer must rely on capitated p roviders s ubmitting their e ncounter data in a timely ma nner to ensure th at pa tients receive a timely a nd c omplete s et of data. T o th e e xtent providers do not submit in a timely manner , there would be a del ay in patients having access to their data . We recommended that MA organizations, M edicaid m anaged car e plans, C HIP m anaged car e entities, and QHP issuers on the FFEs tha t would n eed thi s inf ormation in o rder to me et the pr opose d API requirements in a timely manner should c onsider whether their contracts with network providers should include timing requirements for t he submission of enc ounter da t a and claims so that t he payer can com ply w ith the API requirements m ore timel y. For Medicaid and CHIP FF S programs, we encouraged states to con sider o ther means to en sure that ne cessary en counter da ta from providers is al so provided on a timely basis. We summarize the public comments we received on making claims and encounter data available via t he Patient A ccess API and provide our respo nses. Comment: A few commenters e xp ressed c oncern tha t there a re no named or mature i ndustry FHIR-based standards available for representing and exchangi ng claims information. O ne commenter requested CMS only require a specific subset of claims informati on that would be most useful to patients, suggesting patient name, diagnoses codes, procedure codes, drug codes, service date(s), provider of service, and out-of-pocket costs. Response: We appreciate the commenters' concerns and recommendations. We have been working with industry partners to ensure the necessary FHIR standard and implementation guides as specified at 45 CFR 170.215 are now available to ensure that payers can fully implement sharing claims data via a FHIR -based API, as we are finalizing our proposal to have CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 90 payers impacted by t his r ule make claims and encounter d at a ava ilable via the standards -based Patient A ccess API no later t han one (1) bus iness day af ter claims processing or encounter da ta receipt. To further support payers as they work t o build the Patient Access A PI and map cl aims a nd encounter data for exchange via a FHIR-based API, in partnership with industr y, we have worked to ensure relevant implementation guides and reference implementations are available. A link to specific impl ementation guide s and reference implementations for claims and encounter data have been produced and tested and can be found at https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and- Guidance/Guidance /Interoperability/index . Thou gh not mandatory, usi ng these publicly available r esources will reduce payer burden as they wor k t o prepare the ir data for exchange via a FHIR- based API. We also appreciate the recommendation to onl y include a subset of c la ims information. However, w e believe it is impor tant for patients to ha ve all of their claims inf or mation in or der to facilitate inf orme d decision ma king. Patients ha ve a righ t to t heir claims data. W hile that informati on currently can be obtai ned through various means, we decline to require that only a subset of the available claims i nformation be ava ilable through t he Patient Access API. Comment: One commenter noted th a t health pl ans cannot verify the accuracy of a ll infor mation contained in a c laim. This comm enter requested CMS sh ould st ate that these policies do not mandate th a t payers a udit and correct all information furnished by h ealth care p roviders be yond what is currently necessary for existing rules, regulations, and internal busine ss purposes. Respons e: We appreciate the comm enter's concern. We agree that our r egulations, a s proposed and as finalized, for this Patient Access API do not require that payers do any additional audit or review of the claims they receive beyond current practices. To the extent that CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 91 payers wish to, they may include a disclaimer or other notice to enrollees as part of the API to indicate this. Such a disclaimer would be permissible under these regulations. Comment: A few com menters recommende d that further st andardization work be done t o improve the accuracy of the claims d a ta f ield that ide ntifies th e attributed he alth care p rovide r adm inistering s ervices. I f this d ata e lement is accurate, c ommenters no te it will help e nsur e patients a re reaching out to the right c linician. Commenters believe this could reduce confusion when pa tients s eek c larification or request amendments to the ir hea lth information. Respons e: We a ppreciate the commenters' recommendation and will evaluate pot ential future options to address this concern through our work wit h HL7 and other indust ry partners. We do note, how ever, t his seem s to be a data accuracy issue and not a standardization issue. That said, we do strongly encourage all payers and providers to work together to ensure the accuracy of these and al l da ta. Comment: A few commenters were concerned that c laims data were not accurate representations of clinical findings and therefore not valuable in assisti ng patients in making heal th care decisions. T hese commenters expressed fears that pa tients m ay mis in terpret claims information for health care decision-m aking when claims data serve a payment use case. Response: We appreciate the commenters' concerns. We do note, however, that there is valuable information on the claim relevant to a patient's care and care history that can inform health care decision-making. For instance, this information provides patients with the names of the providers they have visited, when they visited certain providers for certain medical needs, when tests or procedures were conducted, and more information about these tests and procedures. This information alone is very useful to patients as they plan and discuss future care with their providers. Also, in the absence of clinical data (which is required to be provided CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 92 through the Patient Access API under this rule only if the payer maintains such data), claims and encounter data provide a basis of information for patients to work with and get value fro m. Comment: One commenter sought clarification on the scope of Medicaid-covered services to which the requirement to make claims and encounter data available through an API applies. This commenter recommended that CMS specify that this requirement to make claims and encounter data available does not apply to long-term care waiver services, such as in-home care, meal preparation or delivery, and transportation. The commenter stated that providing claims and encounter data for these services through the API would be cumbersome for a variety of reasons including the fact that long-term care waiver services tend to have frequent (daily or weekly) utilization by each participant, which would result in an unwieldly number of claims or encounters being provided through the API for each individual. Response : We confirm that under 42 CFR 431.60(b)(1) and (2), 42 CFR 457.730(b)(1) and (2), 42 CFR 438.242(b)(5) (proposed as \u00a7 438.242(b)(6); see section VI.), and 42 CFR 457.1233(d), states and managed care plans must make adjudicated claims and encounter data available through the API for all Me dicaid- or CHIP-covered services, including long-term services and supports (LTSS). This requirement extends to in-h ome care, transportation services, and all other Medicaid- or CHIP-c overed services for which a claim or encounter is generated and adjudicated. We do not believe the number of claims generated by LTSS will make the data unwieldy or unusable by the beneficiary. We believe that the benefits of providing claims and encounter data to beneficiaries so they can make better health care decisions and know which providers have been paid for providing services to them is no less important simply because it is a frequently provided service. Some beneficiaries may find having such data on frequently CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 93 rendered services more important since billing with such frequency may make it more prone to errors, fraud, waste, and abuse. Comment: Several com mente rs were concerned with the appropriatene ss of sharing cer tain c laims information, particularly spe cific cos ts such as negotiated rates t hat co mmenters believed could r eveal t rade secrets or be considered proprietary information. These commenters requested CMS ensure that confidential, proprietary cost information is excluded from the proposed requirements . One commenter bel ieved that disclosure of information suc h as negot iated rates would lead to higher heal th prices in the industry and other anticompetitive behavior. Specificall y, this commenter gave th e example where dominant payers in a geographic or other marke t use this price inf ormation to deter competitors from entering into value-ba sed payment arrangements. O ne commenter also requested that t hird-party apps be prohibited from aggregati ng or using any cost informati on for purposes othe r than transfer of the data to the patient. Response: We not e that w e take our obligations seriously t o protect from dis closure information that is protected unde r current law. We a lso a ffirm our commitment to safeguarding data protected by law from inappropriate use and disclosure . We unde rstand the conc erns raised around shar ing cost dat a. We appreciate the commenters' concerns, how ever w e reiterate that w e are committed to gi ving patients a ccess to th eir health information, and we believe the benefits of ma king this inf ormation available to pa tie nts through third -party apps outweigh these concerns. It is critical for patients to be tter und erstand health care cost s and be able to plan and b udget as well as possible. H aving cost information, which i s already accessible to p at ients, ava ilable to them in a more easy -to-understa nd presentation would allow pa tients to ge t the maximum benefit from this information. If a patient uses an app to view their health information that does n ot CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 94 clearly indicate it w ill no t use this cost da ta for any othe r p urpose, t here is a chanc e the app could aggregate or otherwi se a nalyz e the data, assu mi ng the singl e app has acc ess to enough patient data in a given market or pa tients who us e a particular p ayer or plan, t o m ake such an analysis possible. A ppreciating patients already h ave access to thi s informati on and understanding the poss ibility for secondary uses of such data, we are finalizing the policy as propose d t o require plans to sh are adjudicated cl aims, i n cluding provider r emittances and enrollee cost-sharing information, via the FHIR- based P atient Access A PI so pa tients can con t inue to acc ess this informati on in ways that will be m ost useful to them. We reiterate, however, that we do not have the authority to di rectly r e gulate thi rd-party apps. Com ment: A few commenters a ls o indi cated th at even if patients had ac cess to p rice information, they woul d not have the abi lity to negotiate or impact health care costs. One commente r noted tha t patients w oul d find pr ospective c o st information mor e valuable tha n retrospective pa yme nt information. Respons e: We a ppreciate the c ommenters' input. W ith access to pr i ce in formation, pa tients who would have cost sharing that is tied to such prices can be more informed consumers of their health care. Even patients who have no direct financial responsibility tied t o these prices can benefit from know ing the informati on in the event the ir insurance coverage changes in the future or so they can app reciate the relationship between the services they r eceive and their cos t to the health c a r e system. It is important for p atients to understand as much as they can about their car e. For instance, unde rstanding the cost s of past services can he l p them p lan for future ser vices. A s a result, t his information has great va lue to pa tients even i f i t does not dir ectly impac t their a bility to specifically influence w hat they pa y fo r the ir care, or tell them exactly how much their next service will cost out of pocket. CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 95 Comment: Many comments wer e receive d regarding price tra nsparenc y, generally, and wer e beyond the scope of the discussi on in th is r ule. O verall, the se were out of scope for this final rule as they referenced other rulemaking activities within HHS. Response: We appreciate the commenters' strong interest in greater price transparency in health care. We strongly support the Administration's and Department's efforts to continue to move toward greater transparency to help health care consumers make the most informed decisions. We point to the recent release of the CY 2020 Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System Policy Changes and Payment Rates and Ambulatory Surgical Center Payment System Policy Changes and Payment Rates. Price Transparency Requirements for Hospitals To Make Standard Charges Public final rule (84 FR 65524). This final rule establishes requirements for all h ospitals operating in the United States to make their standard charges available to the public under section 2718(e) of the PHSA, as well as an enforcement scheme under section 2718(b)(3) to enforce those requirements. Specifically, sections 2718(b)(3) and 2718(e) of the PHSA require that for each year each hospital operating within the United States establish (and update) and make public a list of the hospital's standard charges for items and services provided by the hospital, including for diagnosis-r elated groups established under section 1886(d)(4) of the Act. This final rule requires hospitals (as defined at 45 CFR 180.20) to establish, update, and make public a list of their gross charges, payer-specific negotiated charges (including the de- identified minimum and maximum negotiated charges), and discounted cash prices for all items and services online in a single digital file that is in a machine-r eadable format, as well as their payer-specific negotiated charges (including the de-identified minimum and maximum negotiated charges) and discounted cash prices (or gross charges, if a discounted cash price is not CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 96 offered by the hospital) for a more limited set of shoppable services online in a consumer- friendly fo rmat. We also d irect com menters to the tri -agency Transparenc y in Coverage proposed rule (84 FR 65464) for additional proposals to further price transparency. Comment: Some commenters gen erally oppose d the proposal to m ake claims and encounter data available through a standards-based API no later than one (1) business day after receiving it. Some commenters suggested the proposed data availability t imeframe is challengi ng due to the timeline for sharing adjudicated c laims, in pa rticular, not ing the different timeframes f or payment discharge, benefit determination, and settlement of the patient account. One commenter noted the reliance on third-pa rty contractors to adjudi cat e claims and the time required t o migrate data fr om one system to another and that validation could take longer than one (1) bus iness day. Several commenters expressed concern about the timeframe based on revised d eterminations o r revi sed de cisions triggered by da ta that arrives a fter the ini tial determination. One commenter specifically que s tioned th e value of third -party application use of cl aims dat a when an enr ollee has filed an app eal and is awaiting a reconsideration decision. One commenter r ecommended CMS only permit finalized claims where a determination has been made be available to be shared vi a the Patient A ccess API. S ome commenters specifically r eferenced t he r eliance of MA plans on pharm acy b enefit management organizations for the a d ministration of Part D be nefits a s a factor in the ability to m ake th ese claims dat a available within one (1) business day af te r receiving them. O ther c ommenters re ferenced the Explanation of Benefit requirements tha t provide a timeframe for i nformati on adjustment , which means that the final information may not be available in one (1) business day. CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 97 Several commenters suggested an alternative timeframe of 3 or 5 da ys for ve nd or- adjudicated claims, c iting time a nd costs. S ome c ommenters r ecomme nded a grace period for plans when there is a delay due to delayed provider encounter data submission. In addition, some requested an exception for specific conditions attributable t o certain claims and enc ounter data. Other commenters recommended t hat CMS work with st akeholders to determine an appropriate ti meframe for making claims and en counter d ata ava ilable via the Patient Access API. R esponse: We a ppreciate the commenters' concerns and recommendations, including comments r egarding claims th at ma y be under appeal. We are finalizing this policy as proposed that pa yers make available through the Patient A ccess API, n o later t han one (1) bus iness day after the inf ormation is received: (1 ) adjudicated claims, in cluding claims data fo r payment decisions that may be appealed, were app ealed, or are in the process of ap peal, and (2) encounter data. We reiterate that this is one (1) business day af te r the claim i s adjudicated o r enc ounter da ta are received. This al lows for pote ntial delays in a djudication or delays in providers submitting the ir encounter data. It does not require payers and providers to change their contractual relationships or current processes for receipt, though we strongly encourage payers and providers to work together to make patient data available in as timely a manner as possible. We beli eve it is valuabl e to pa tients to be able to have their d ata in as timely a manner as possi ble. Having access to this information within one (1) bu siness day could empower patie nts to ha ve the i nformation they need when they need it to inform care coor dination a nd improve patie nt outcomes. I f a patient needs to ge t follow -up care, having the information relevant to the ir previous visit is important and valuable. API tec hnology allows this exchange to happen more qu ickly a nd efficiently, a nd we believe it is important to leverage th is technological opportunity to ensure patients have the most current information about their care. CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 98 It is also important for patients to get this information timely even if there is the possibility of a change in determination due to appeal or other factors. We conducted research to evaluate the maturity of claims to inform researchers using the Chronic Conditions Data Warehouse (CCW) data. 30 This research indicates that nearly half of all Medicare FFS or carrier claims are submitted once and unchanged, and nearly 85 percent of inpatient claims are never adjusted. For carrier claims, 99 percent are fully mature at 10 months; and of non- inpatient claims that were adjusted, 0.13 perc ent or less had the diagnosis code changed. What this research shows is that many claims remain unchanged, and those that do take more that 3 or 5 days after adjudication to begin to mature. This wait would not provide patients more accurate or complete da ta; it would only delay their ability to benefit from access to their information. Patients have a right to see the full lifecycle of their claims and encounter information, and we believe they should be able to have access to their information as soon as it is available. Even if the payment amounts may change due to appeal, for instance, the services received and the providers who rendered them are less likely to change. This is very useful information and could impact care decisions and facilitate better care coordination if available as soon as possible. We do appreciate that there are many factors that could influence when some data are available. Again, we encourage payers to work with health care providers and third- party contractors to ensure timely data processing. Comment: Several commenters expressed concern that the proposed timeframe for payers to share claims and encounter data with patients could require providers to accelerate their submissions to payers triggering additional requirements in ex isting contracts for the submission 30 Chronic Conditions Data Warehouse.

One commenter re commended removal of proposed rule pre amble language suggesting that MA plans, Medicaid managed care pla ns, CHIP managed care entities, and QHP issuers on the FFEs could consider adding time requirements for submission of claims a nd encounter data in the i r contracts w ith providers. O ne commenter r ecommended CMS provide sample contract language or dedicate resources to educating providers about the intent of these possible contract revisions. Response: We appreciate the commenters' conc erns and recommendations. A s discussed in the CMS Int eroperability and Patient Access proposed r u le, w e do appr eciate that s ome payers may consider adding timeframes to contracts wit h providers to help ensure patients get timely access to their claims and encounter data. Agai n, we strongl y e ncourage provi ders to make this informa tion available in as timely a fashion as possible to be st assi st patients in ha ving access to the ir health informati on. Adding language to con tracts is one way for payers and providers to work toge ther to e ns ure patients ge t this va luable inf ormation in as t imely a manner as possi ble. We believe providers can benefit as well if this informati on is available sooner; it cou ld be shared wit h them for the purposes of care coordinati on in a more timel y manner , too. It may take s ome t ime f or providers to imp rove internal efficiencies to m eet potential ne w time line r equirements, but we believe the long- t erm benefit outweighs pot ent ial short term im plementation burde n. We do note , however, that the poli cy being finalized in this rule is specifi c to payers making adjudicated claims and encounter informati on available t o patients via the Patient Access API w ithin one (1) business day af ter the pa yer receives the i nformation. Any additional timeframes are between the payer s and their providers. (2) Provider Directory Data CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 100 re quired P atient Access A P I make available pr ovider directory data , including updates to such data. The proposal at 45 CFR 156.221 would not require QHP is suers to pe -party re trieval of provider directory (a nd pref erred d rug list information) because such informati on is already required to be provi ded by QHP issuers on the FFEs . For MA orga nizations, at proposed 42 CFR 422.119(b)(1)(iii), we proposed to specify that MA or ganizations make specific pr ovider directory information for their network of contr acted p roviders accessible through their P atient Access A PIs: the names of pr oviders ; addresses; phone numbers; and specialty. This in formation is the same in f ormation MA or ganizations are already required t o disclose to their enrollees unde r 42 CFR 422.111( b)(3) and make available online under 42 CFR 422.111( h)(2)(ii). As proposed, MA organizations would be required to e nsure the availability of this in formation through the Patient A ccess A PI for all MA plans. We noted that inc luding this informati on in a standards- ba sed API allows non- MA thi rd- par ty applications to consume, aggregate, and display th is data in di ffe rent contexts, a llowing patients to u nderstand and c ompare p la n in formation in a w ay that can be st serve their indi vidual needs. As proposed, MA plans would be require d to update provider di rectory information available through the API no later than 30 business days after changes to the provider directory ar e made. Under proposed 42 CFR 431.60(b)(3) and 457.730(b)(3), state Medicai d and CHIP age ncies respectively would be require d to make provide r director y information available thr ough the Patient Access API, including updated provider informati on no later than 30 calendar days after the state receives this provider directory information or updates to provider directory CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 101 information. The proposed regulation for Medicaid managed care plans at 42 CFR 438.242(b)(6) (finalized as \u00a7 438.242(b)(6) in this final rule; see section IV. of thi s fin al rule) and for CHI P managed care entities at 42 CFR 457.1233(d)(2) would require MCOs, PIHPs, and PAHPs to comply w ith the same t i meframe, w ith the a dditio n of spe cific provider directory information as noted in 42 CFR 438.24 2(b)(6)(ii) and 457.1233(d)(2)(ii). For Medicai d managed care plans and C HIP managed care entities, we proposed the provider directory information available through the API must include all informati on that is specified in 42 CFR 438.10( h) (1) about provider directories for disclosure to m anaged care enrollees. We proposed that t he Patient A ccess API be updated with new provider directory information within 30 calendar days from when the upda ted informati on is received by the st ate (or the managed care plan under 42 CFR 438.24 2(b) (6) (finalized as \u00a7 438.242(b)(6) in this final rule; see section IV. of thi s fin al rule) and \u00a7 457.1233(d)(2)) to be consistent with existi ng Medicaid managed care rules at 42 CFR 438.10(h)(3). We proposed that the API implemented by the state Medicaid agenc y would include the data elements specified for di sclosure by Medicaid st ate agencies in sec tion 1902(a)(83) of the Act; we proposed at 42 CFR 438.242( b)(6)(ii) that t he Patient A ccess API implemented by Medicaid managed care plans would ha ve the data elements specified f or disclosure at 42 CFR 438.10(h)(1) . For CHIP age ncies that operate FFS systems a nd CHIP ma naged care entities at 42 CFR 457.730(b)(3) and 457.1233( d)(2)(ii), respectively, we also proposed that provider directory data be available through the API no later than 30 calendar days after receipt of updated information. We did not propose a similar requirement for QHP issuers on the FFEs. As discussed in the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access proposed rule (84 FR 7633), these issuers are already required, under 45 CFR 156.230(c) and implementing guidance, to make provider CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 102 directory information accessible in a machine -readable format. Because this inf orm ation is already highly accessible in this format, we noted that we did not believe the bene fits of making it also available through a standards- ba sed A PI outweigh the burden for QHP issuers on the FFEs. However, we sought comment as to whether this same requirement should apply to QHP issuers, or if such a requirement would be overly burdensome for them . To avoid unnecessary duplication of effort and potential confusion, we are not finalizing the proposal to include provider director y informati on in the P atient A ccess API. I nstead, we are finalizing the inc lusion o f this information (consistent in scope a s proposed for the Patient A ccess A PI) in the public fa cing P rovider Directory A PI discussed in s ection IV. of this fin a l rule, which requires MA orga nizations, Medicaid FFS p rograms, Medi caid m anaged c are plans, CHIP F FS programs, an d CHIP m anaged car e entiti es to provide public access to co mplete and ac curate provider directory information comments we re ceived on provider directory information and APIs addressed i ssues relevant to bot h inc luding these data in the Patient A ccess API discussed in th is section o f the final rule, b ut more s o making thi s informat ion more widely available through the Provider Directory API as discusse d in secti on IV. of this fi nal rule, all comments and our responses relate d to provider director y information via API s can be found in section IV. of this fin a l rule. (3) Clinica l Data inc luding Laboratory R esults Regarding the provision of clinical data, including laborator y results, we propos ed at 42 CFR 422.11 9(b)(1)(iv) that MA or ganizations make c linical data, s uc h as laboratory te st results, ava ilable through the API if the M A or ganization maintains such data. W e also proposed in paragraph (c)(3)(i) that the USCDI standard, proposed by ONC for HHS adoption at 45 CFR CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 103 170.213, be used as the content and vocabulary standard for the clinical data made available through the API. We intended the proposal to mean that the dat a require d under paragraph (b)(1)(iv) be the same a s the data tha t is specified in that content and vocabulary s tandard de fined a t 45 CFR 170.213. In effect, we proposed that at a minimum any clinical data included in the USCDI standard, proposed by ONC for HHS adoption at 45 CFR 170.21 3, be avai lable through the Patient Access API i f suc h data ar e maintained by the MA organization. We recognized that some M A organizations re ceive this i nformation r egularly , or as a part of their con tracted a rrangements for health services, but that not al l MA organizations do. Therefore, we proposed that this requirement woul d apply to MA organizations, regardless of the type of MA plan offered by the MA organization, but only under circumstances when the MA organization receives and maintains t his clinical d ata as a part of it s normal ope rations. The proposed requirement aligned with existing regulations at 42 CFR 422.118, which required MA organizations to disclose to individual enrollees any medical records or other health or enrollment information the MA or ganizations maintain w ith respec t to their enrollees. W e proposed that this data be available through the API no later than one (1) business day from its receipt by the MA organization. Similarly, the proposed regulations for Medicai d and CHIP FFS progr ams and managed care plans (proposed 42 CFR 431.60 (b)(4) and \u00a7 457.730(b)(4)), required provisi on A ccess API of st andardized cl inical da ta, including laboratory r esults, if ava ilable, no later t han on e (1) business day af t er the data are received (by t he state or t he managed care plan or entity) . We noted that this woul d ensure that data provided thr ough the API woul d be the most current data available, which ma y be critical if the da ta are be ing shared b y an enrollee w ith a health care provider who is basing clinical decisions on these data. As noted, like proposed 42 CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 104 CFR 422.11 9(c), the Medicai d and CHIP regulations propos ed compliance with the regulations regarding t he USCDI st andard, proposed by ONC for HHS adoption at 45 CFR 170.21 3, as the c ontent and vocabulary s tanda rd for the clinical data a v ailable thr ough the Patient Access A PI; there fore, w e pr oposed t hat a t a min imum any clinical data included in that USCDI standard be made available through the Patient A ccess API w ithin on e (1) business day of receipt. For state a gencies managing Medicaid or CHIP FFS programs, we proposed that such data be made available through the API unde r the proposal if t he state maintains clinical data. T he proposed r egulati on for Medicai d m anaged care plans at 42 CF R 438.2 42(b)(6) (finalized as \u00a7 438.242(b)(5) in this rule; see section VI.) and CHIP managed care entities at 42 CFR 457.1233(d)(2) would require MCOs, PIHPs, and PAHPs to comply wit h the same st andard in terms of the scope of information and the timing o f its availability th rough the Patient Access A PI; the limitation th at t he clinical data be ma intained by the entity for it to be required to be sent via the P atient A ccess API w ould car ry through to mana ged car e plans and entities under t he proposal. Proposed 45 CFR 156.2 21(b)(1)(iii) would r equire QHP i ssuers on the FFEs to al so make thes e clinical data, including laboratory re sults, available v ia the Patient Access API, w it h the approval and at the direction of the enrollee, if the QHP maintains such data. We recognized not all of t he entities subject to this requirement have uniform ac cess t o this typ e of data a nd sought comment on what barriers e xist that woul d discourage them from obtaining, maintaining, and maki ng these data av ailable through the Patient Access API. We summarize the public comments we received on the inclusions of clinical d a ta, specificall y the data inc luded in the USCDI standard, via the Patient Access API and provide our responses below. CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 105 Comment: Several com mente rs expressed con cerns that pa ye rs are typically not the origi nal source of clinical information, including data e lements tha t are pa rt of the USCDI, a nd w ould not be the best source of the m ost a ccurate clinical da ta for patients. T he se commenters noted concerns with data accuracy provided by payers who are typicall y secondary sources of thi s clinical informati on and explained that payers do not verify this information. One commenter believed the originator should be providing the data, or that payers should be allowed t o indicate the provenance of the data and where to direct questions regarding data accuracy. There was concern that the administrative burden on providers could increase due to p at ient inquiries a nd requests to c orrect or clarify their data. Respons e: We appreciate the commenters' conc erns and recommendations. We under stand that payers are not the source of this clinical information; however, payers do maintain clinical d ata that can be of great v alue to pa tients. We not e that provenanc e i s one data class within the USCDI. As suc h, this information would be available t o patients. We als o note, that as discussed above , we intend to provi de suggested content for educational information that payers w ill be able to tailor and use to communicate w ith the ir patients a bout the Patient Access A PI. P ayers can choos e to indicate the part o f a data exchange that w as received from an out side s ource so the receivi ng pa rty unde rstands where to direct questions. T his will also he lp pa tients understa nd how to address incorrect information as it can be made clear where questions should be directe d. Payers are unde r no obligation under this Patient Access API requirement to validat e or correct clinical data receive d from another sour ce; and, providers are under no obligati on to submi t updated da ta to p ayers should pa tients suggest t here is an er ror in t heir da ta. W e do encourage payers and providers to continually work to ensure the accuracy of the patient data they maintain and share to the extent possible. The Patient Access API must include all of the CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 106 specified c linica l information for the e nrollee m a intained by t he payer with a da te o f service on or after January 1, 2016. Comment: A few commenters were concerned that pa yers could us e clinical d ata to dis criminate against providers, suc h as through discriminatory reimbursement models, for i nstance offering lower reimbursement rates f or certain types of care that a physician deems necessary or in the best interest of the patient based on the data viewed about the doctor and the care they provide. Response: We appreciate the commenters' conc erns; ho wever, w e not e the fact that s ome payers are already automatically accessing a physician's EHR f or other pu rposes, e ither as an elective offering or thr ough contractual requirements. A s a re sult, a dd itional data than is required to meet the requirements of this final rule are already being shared between providers and payers. We re iterate tha t payers are not entitled to re ce ive information f rom a health c are provider if such informati on is protecte d by a pplicable federal, s tate, or loc a l law from disclosure to the payer. This final rule does not change any such existi ng legal obligations. C omment: A few commenters expressed concerns over provider liability for the quality or accur acy of clinical data and for being given certain sensitive patient diagnosis and problems information, particularly if the provider is a downstream recipient of such data. Response: We appreciate the commenters' conc erns, b ut reiterate that the policies finalize d in this regulation do not change any pa yer or pr ovider's obligations to abide by existing federal and state regulations and law, including 42 CFR part 2, which governs certain substance use disorder records, which are some of the most sensitive health information. We note , however, t hat the patient can di re ct the entity to t ransfer this s ensitive data upon their designation of a recipient, or may provide consent or authorization for the transfer, as applicable. As a CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 107 provider , and likely as a covered entity under HIPAA, providers are experienced i n handling sens itive data. A ccess through an A PI will provide a new r oute to r eceiving sens itive data, not add to the burden of protecting suc h information, given t he continued need to maintain complianc e with al l appl icable rul es and regulations. T hese p ol icies ju st allow this inf ormation to be tra nsmitted via an API with the approval and at the direction of the pat ient. Comment: Some commenters exp ressed concer n that patients may not unde rstand, or may be confused by, the healt h information t hat will be available, a nd questioned if t his infor mation will all be re levant to pa tients. A fe w c ommenters re commended tha t educational materials and r esourc es be developed t o ens ure t hat the dat a are useful and do not cause alarm. R esponse: We appreciate the commenters' conc erns and recommendations. We appr eciate that every pa tient may no t understand e very p iece of information in the ir me dical recor d. We intend to provide sugge sted content for educational materials or other patient resources that pa yers can tailor and us e to ensure tha t patients have information about how to accurately a nd pr oductivel y navi gate their health care informati on, a s further discussed below in this s ection. It is important for patients to ha ve access to their records, review them, and have an opport unity to raise questions and s eek clarification about the information maintaine d in them. Com ment: One commenter r equested C MS expl ain the requirement t hat MA organizations make clinical da ta available through the Patient Access API if the e ntity \"manages such data,\" particularl y what is meant by \"manages suc h data.\" This commenter noted that providers manage clinical da ta and requested clarification of whether t he r equirement applies to MA orga nizations. Another commenter expressed similar concerns and inquired whether \"mana ged b y the payer\" would inc lude only lab r esults o r all clinical data. C omme nters questioned if \"manage\" meant \"electronically stored the 03/06/20 108 Response: We a ppreciate the commenters' request for additional information. As no ted in the CM S Interoperability and Patient Access proposed rule, payers, including MA organizations, need t o make these data available through the API w hen t he payer r eceives and maintains these data as a part of its norm al operations (84 FR 7633) . We used t he verb \"manages\" to communicate that this proposed requirement would apply when the payer has access to the data, control over the data, and the authority to make the data available through the API. In order to more closely align wit h how the relevant HI PAA Privacy Rule requirement refers to such activity, we a re f inalizing the regulation te xt at 42 C FR 4 22.119(b)(1)(iii), 431.60( as with t he verb \"maintains\" in p la ce of the ver b \"m anages\". As such, we define \"maintain \" to mean the payer ha s access to the data, con tr ol over the data, and authorit y to make the data available through the API. Comment: One commenter questioned i f Medicaid a gencies w ill be required to provide clinical d ata regardless of t he t ype of transaction by which the agency r eceived t he data. Response : We confirm that M edicaid and CHIP age ncies, an d their r esp ective managed care plans, will be required unde r 42 CFR 431.60(b)(4), 457.730(b)(3), 438.242(b)(5), and 457.1233( d) to provide clinical data through the API if the state or managed care plan maintains such c linical data. C linica l data s ubjec t to this re quirement includes la bora tory re sults and ot he r clinical d ata, a nd must be made available through the Patient A ccess API r egardless of the type of t ransaction by which the state or managed car e plan r eceived t he data originally. However, i f the data were received u nder t he payer -to-payer data exchange requirement f inalized i n section V. of this final rule at 42 CFR 422.119( f), 438.62(b)(1)(vi), and 457.1216, and 45 CFR 156.221(f) , then the payer woul d only need to share the clinical data received via the payer- to- payer data exchange via the Patient Access A PI if the data were received from another payer via CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 109 a standards-based API. As require 42 CFR 422.119( 438.62(b)(1)(vi)(C), and 457.1216 via the payer-to-payer d ata exc hange only need to be made available to share in the electronic form an d format t he y w ere received from another pa ye r. If a payer r eceives data specifically for the payer -to-p ayer da ta exchange via an A PI, they can t hen make these data available via the Patient A ccess API w ithout additional burde n - the payer will not be required pe r this f inal rule to take da ta from a nother payer rece ived as a direct r esult of the payer -to-paye r data exchange policy and prepare it to be shared via the Patient Access FHIR -base d API; the paye r will only be required to incorporate tha t data into the enrollee's record so that it can be shared with a new payer , if requested by the patient, in the electronic form and format received. Appreciating concerns raised around the burden of preparing data for exchange via an API, we have provide d this guidance to minimize this burden. We not e that Medicaid and CHIP st at e agencies are not subject to t he payer -to-pa yer d ata exchange requirement in this rulemaking, as we did not propose this policy for these entities. Comment: A few commenters recommended that pa tients have acce ss to de tailed and accurate lab test and results information through the Patient A ccess API. A few commenters were not supportive of CMS' proposal that laboratory information be made available only where available. O ne commenter r ecommended that t hese same API r equirements apply to laboratories providing service to Medicare and Medicaid patients as any provider receiving reimbursement for medical services. O ne commenter expr essed concern that lab information is not standardized and may be difficult to exchange. Response: We appreciate the commenters' conc er ns and recommendations. T hese re gulations requiring the Patient Access A PI and de tailing the data a vailable thr ough th e Patient Access API, as proposed and as finalized, do not apply to laboratories or to any providers - these CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 110 requirements are specific to pa yers as detailed ab ove, but we will r eview t he recommendations made for potential future consideration. Regarding concerns about standardized data exchange of laborator y information, the re gulations finalized i n this rule prov ide the content and vocabulary standards at 45 CFR 170.213 needed to address sharing laborator y data through the AP I. Implementation guidance , now avai lable at https://www.cms.gov/Regulations- and-Guidance/Guidance/Interoperability/index, though not mandator y, can be used to further support sha ring these data utilizi ng the content and voca bulary standards adopted i n this rule. These implementation guides and r eference implementations provide additional support to help payers implement this policy in a sta ndardized w ay that facilitates in te roperability. Com ment: Some commenters were c once rned about the proposed timeline and challenges specifically because of t he nature of laboratory d ata, sp ecifically laboratory r esults. F inal r esults can r eplace preliminary results, and l aboratory da ta coming from thi rd pa rties can take t ime to receive. Additionall y, there may be conf licting disclosure requirements that permit up to 30 days to pa ss before laborator y data are ava ilable to a payer. Response: We appreciate the commenters' conc erns. We do understand that there are many factors that coul d influence when some data are available. H ow ever, w e reiterate that this Patient Access A PI policy re quires th e information to be shared no la ter than one (1) business da y after it is re ceived b y the regulated pa ye r. If it takes a dditional time for laborato ry informati on to be provided to a paye r, that does not impact the payer's obligation t o make the da ta available via the Patient Access A PI no later than one (1) bus iness day af ter the receipt of the information by the payer. Therefore, we strongly encourage all payers and providers to work CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 111 to make data ava ilable in as timely a fashion as possible to en sure an opt imally i nformed he alth care ecosystem. Comment: Many commenters supporte d the proposal to r equire provid ing the information in the USCDI via the P a tient Access A PI. C ommenters s upported a lignment with O NC on this and encouraged additional alignment across gove rnment data sets. Commenters also supported the data classes and asso ciated st andards in the proposed O NC U SCDI. O ne commenter specifically not ed support for the pediatric v ital s igns proposed a s part of the U SCDI. A fe w commenters recommended the addition of data cl asses that a re already proposed as part of the US CDI, such as clinical notes, provenance, and unique device identifiers . A few com m enters strongly supported the inclusion of notes in the USCDI, c iting several studies of the benefits of patie nts ha ving this in formation including, but not limited to, p atient literacy, empowerment, health care coordination, medication adherence , a nd safety. One commenter recommended only final notes b e considered a pplicable to the USCDI and that the ima g ing note be r emoved from the type s of required notes. This commenter also indicated that notes tha t contai n sensitive infor mation were lik ely subj ect to a variety of state pr ivacy la ws. A fe w c ommenters not ed further standardization work was needed for provenance data fields. Response: We appreciate the commenters' supp ort and recommendations; w e have shared th ese c om ments a bout the USCDI with O N C for futur e consideration. We agree that aligning with ONC and finalizing exchange of th e USCDI as defined at 45 CFR 170.213 i n ONC's 21s t Century C ures A c t fina l rule (published elsewhe re in t his issue of the Federal Register ) has many benefits and will help us reach our interoperability go als. We r efer readers t o ON C's fina l rule for the specifics o f exactly how the USCDI standard is being fina lized by HHS. As finalized here, the clinical data required to be made available through the Patient Access API CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 112 at at a minimum are the USCDI version 1 as defined at 45 CFR 170.213 and specified i n this rule at FR 422.119( (i). W e do note the policies f inalized in this regulation do not alter obligations under existing fe de ral and state laws. We r eiterate tha t we a re w orking closely w ith H L7 and ot her pa rtners l eading the effort t o develop standards to ens ure he lpful gui dance i s ava ilable for pa yers to con sult as they work to imp lement the policies be ing finalized in this ru le. A g ain, we not e that, though not ma ndator y, we are prov iding a link to specific implementation guides and reference implementations that provide valuable guidance to support payers as they work to implement the Pat ient A ccess API: https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and- Guidance/Guidance/Interoperability/index. Comment: One commenter r that al l the data elements in the USCDI be specifically enumerated i n the regulati on te xt of this final rule for clarity. A few commenters recommended C MS a nd ONC limit the definition of electronic he alth inf ormation to solely the dat a classes include d in the USCDI . A nother commenter di d not believe this definition should be limited to identifiable information. O ne commenter suggested tha t the definition o f electronic health information should inc lude real price in formation. Response: We appreciate the commenters' r ecommendations. We are finalizing our regulation text that requires us e of the s tandard specified at 45 CF R 170.213 in ONC's separate rulemaki ng to ensure alignment and c onsistency across the tw o regulations. That specific standard is currently th e USCDI version 1 and therefore th e USCD I will be the in it ial s tandard applicable u nder this f inal rule. A ddi tional information about the data c lasses a nd da ta elements included in USCDI can be found at http://www.healthit.gov/USCDI. We continue to use CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 113 \"electronic health information\" as defined by ONC at 45 CFR 171.102. With regard to specifically listing the data elements in the USCDI, we believe cross referencing ONC's regulation better supports our goal of aligning with ONC's policy regarding this information. Comment: One commenter di d not support the proposed requirement to provide patients with t he USCDI da ta because the commenter be lieved i t was not feasibl e for pay ers. The commente r indicated tha t payers do not typically c ollect clinical data. O ne commenter r ecommended that CMS use FHIR bundl es, or a collection of relevant FHIR re sources, ra ther t han the USCDI. One commenter was concerne d with how free te xt fields would be addresse d in the US CDI. One commenter expressed concer n that CMS woul d require the use of non-HIPAA standards in the USCDI for pr ovi ding data to patients. Response: We appreciate the commenters' conc er ns and recommendations. We ac knowledge tha t payers do not maintain a ll clinical data fo r all patients a nd our regul ation text at 42 and 45 CFR 156.221( b)(1)(iii), as finalized, specifically limits the obligation to make clinical data a va ilable thr ough the Patient Access API t o those payers that m ai ntain any such da ta. If a payer subj ect to these regulations (including the Medicaid and CHIP m anaged c are plans that are subject to regulations that incorporat e these requirements) maintain the data elements specified i n this final r ule, t h ese data elements must be shared as noted in this final r ule us ing the standards indicated. If payers do maintain va luable c linical data about patients, pa tie nts ha ve a right to the se da ta. Thi s is a fir st step in p roviding patients w ith information f rom the ir medical record in a n efficient electronic format. We appreciate the recommendation to look at al ternatives to the USCDI, but we believe it is critical for interoperability to align with ONC and see great value in the continued CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 114 coordination between CMS, ONC, and partners such as HL7 to ensure helpful guidance is available for payer s to consult as the y work to s uc cessfully implement these fina l rule p olicies. To this end, we again note tha t we have provide d a link to specific impl ementation guides and reference implementations that, though not mand atory, can be used to support consistent implementation. We r efer readers to additiona l in formation on the USCDI at ht tp://www.healthit.gov/USCDI and available guidance at https://www.cms.gov/Regulations- and-Guidance/Guidance/Interoperability/index to best unde rstand how to implement all data classes and elements included i n the USCDI incl uding text fields. Regarding the use of non- HIPAA versus HIPAA standards, we do not believe there is a conflict, and we ref er readers to the dis cussion of Administrative Simplification transaction standards in section III.C.2.b. of this final rule for mor e inf ormation. Comment: One commenter sugge sted that standards as HL7 woul d be better posi tioned to support data standardization rather than the proposed USCDI approach. A few commenters noted t here are different use cases for various dat a t ypes and t hat coordination is require d to expand the data in t he USCDI. O ne commenter recommended C MS allow voluntary extensions to data sets outside of the USCDI to support the growth of new standards and da ta typ es from a payer pe rspective. R esponse: We appreciate the commenters' recommendations. In a ddition, we appreciate the valuable role of standards development organizations, like HL7, and reiterate our commitment to worki ng with such partners as indus try develops the necessary standards and associated g uidance to implement the pol icies be ing finalized in this rul e. W e will continue to refer to the USCDI as fina lize d by H HS in O NC's 21s t Century C ures A c t fina l rule ( published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register) at 45 CFR 170.213 to ensure alignment and CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 115 consistency acr oss the two regulations. We fur ther refe r re aders to a dditional information about the USCDI and the expansion process as defined by ONC at http://www.healthit.gov/USCDI. We not e that t his expansion proc ess is a consensus proc ess that allows for public input and comment and strongl y recomme nd stakeholders conti nue to engage in this valuable process. This coordination and consensus is a cornerstone of our interoperabilit y efforts . We also note tha t the data e lements re quired in thi s f inal r u le re presen t the minimum data that must be shared unde r our fi nalized policy through a payer 's Patient Access API. We strongl y encourage paye rs to share mor e data as the more data that pa tients have access to, t he more they w ill be nefit f rom t his access. We agree that continui ng to push these limits will spur innovation and growth. Comment: A few commenters r equested a dd itional information regarding the definitions of te rminology used when discussing the USCDI in the CMS Interoperabilit y and Patient Access pr oposed rule. One commenter requeste d more informati on on the meaning of \"s tate agencies,\" in reference to \"any clinical data included in the USCDI standard . . . be available through the AP I,\" and if this meant that if the state agency managed an immunization registry it would be required t o make the dat a available through an API. Another commenter requested CMS to provide more inf ormation a bout the use of \"forward\" (in th e preamble) versus \"send\" (in th e regulatory text) regarding the USCDI, inc ludi ng whether the infor mation needs t o be avai lable to the receiving payer and whether use of a truste d exchange netw ork is required. Response: We a ppreciate the commenters' requests fo r addi tional information. We note that the term \"state agenci es\" in this ins tance in the proposed rule (84 FR 7634) refers to those state agencies that manage Medicaid and CHIP programs. I f a Medicaid or CHIP st ate agency ha s immunization data in connection with its Medicaid program or CHIP as defined in the USCDI, these data would be required to be available via the Patient Access API per our proposal CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 116 as finalize d. We note that in s ection V. of this final rule, we require the exchange of the USCDI between payers subject to this regulation; this payer- to-payer da ta exchange does n ot require the use of an API. As finalized, our policies do not require the use of a trusted exchange network. Regarding the use of terms \"forward\" and \"send, \" we note this means that the data must be exchanged with t he patient as specified he re in section III. of this f inal rule or between pa yers a s discussed in section V. of this final r ule. (4) Drug Benefit Dat a, including Pharmacy Directory, and Formulary Data We proposed that drug benefit data, including pharmacy director y information and formulary o r preferred d rug list data, also be available th rough the Patient A ccess A PI at propos ed 42 CFR 422.1 19(b)(2)(ii) and (iii), 431.60(b)(5), and 457.730( b)(5). (Our proposal for providing prescription drug claims through this API is discussed in section III.C.2.c.(1) of the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access proposed rule (84 FR 7632) .) As previousl y discussed, Me dicaid managed care plans would be require d by 42 C FR 438.242(b)(6) (fi nalized as \u00a7 438.242(b)(5) in this rule; see section VI.) to comply wit h the requirement at 42 CFR 431.60(b)(5), and CHIP managed care entities would be required by 42 CFR 457.1233( d)(2) to comply w ith the requirement at 42 C FR 457.730(b)(5). We propos ed at 42 CFR 422.119( b)(2)(ii) and (iii) that MA organizations offering MA- PD pl ans m ust make a v ailable th rough the API the fo llowing p harmacy b enefit data: (1) pharma cy di rectory da ta, inc luding th e num ber, mix (s pecifically th e type of phar macy, suc h as \"ret ail ph armacy\"), and addr esses of pha rmacies in t he plan network; and (2) fo rmulary da ta including covered P art D dr ugs and any tiered formulary s tructure or utilization management procedure which pertains to those drugs. The pharmacy directory inf orm ation is the same information that MA-PD plans - like all Part D plans - must provide on their websites under 42 CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 117 CFR 423.12 8(b)(5) and (d)(2). While prescription drug claims would have to be made available through the Patient A ccess A PI no later than one (1) business day after the MA-PD pl an's re ceipt of that information, we di d not propose a s pe cific ti meframe for pharmacy di rectory o r formulary i nformati on to be available (or upda ted) through the API. We note d that we intended that the requirements in 42 CFR part 423 requiring whe n and how information related to pharmacy di rectories be upda ted would appl y to the provision of thi s informati on through the API; we solicite d comment whet her we should address this in the regulation text or otherwise impos e a timeframe for this information to be made available th ro ugh the API. A t 42 CFR 431.60(b)(5), for Medicaid FFS programs, and at 42 CFR 457.730(b)(5) for CHIP FFS programs, we proposed that states would be required to include and update informati on about covered outpatient drugs and upda tes to such information, including, where appl icable, p referred d rug list information, no la ter than on e (1) business day a fter the e ffective date of any such information or updates to suc h information. We di d not propose a s imilar requirement for QHP issuers on the FFEs because , like the provi der directory information, QHP issuers a re re quired to make drug f ormulary da ta accessible in a machine-r eadable format. As discussed above for the provider directory information, to avoid unnecessary duplication of effort and potential confusion, we are also not finalizing the proposal to include pharmacy directory information in the Patient Access API. Instead, we are only finalizing the inclusion of this information as proposed and explained above be included in the public facing Provider Directory API discussed in section IV. of this final rule, which requires MA organizations that offer MA-PD plans to provide public access to pharmacy directory CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 118 informati on at 42 CFR 422.120( b). R elevant comments are also discussed in section IV. of this final rule. We summarize the public comments received on our proposal that information about drug coverage and pharmacy benefit coverage be available through the Patient Access API and provide our responses. Comment: One commenter re commended CMS require that MA plans make information about patients' step therapy available for sharing electronically. This commenter oppos es step thera py and r ecommended that it not be used in MA or Part D. Response: The us e of step thera py is beyond the scope of th is rule. However, because step thera py is a utilization management pr ocedure, it is included among the types of information MA-PDs mus t make a v ailable a bout Part D dr ugs through the API. In r egard to information about utilization management that pertains to basic benefits, which was not addresse d in this rule, w e appreciate the commenter's recommendations and w ill evaluate them for potential fut ure consideration. Com ment: One commenter strongly re commended the inclusion and standardizati on of pre scripti on drug monitoring program data (PDMP) for exchange through APIs, although this commenter referred more to exc hange between pr ovider s for downstream c linical de cision support and analytics rather than for patient access. A fe w commenters w e re not in favor of s haring PDMP data through APIs. A few commenters were not supportive of PDMP data being available to other providers and payers. Response: We appreciate the commenters' recommendations and concerns. However, we note that this information is not required to be available through the Patient Access API as it is not within the scope of 422.119(b)(2). CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 119 Comment : Several com menters expressed con cern t h at t he proposal s in 42 CFR 431.60(b)(5), 457.730(b) (5), 438.242(b)(6) (finalized as 438.242( b)(5) rule; see section VI.), and 45 CFR 457.1233( d) to provide informati on on covere d outpatient drugs and pr eferred d rug lists thro ugh an API within one (1) business day a fte r the e ffective da te of the inf ormati on or upda tes to the in formati on may be a chal lenge for state Medicaid a nd CHIP agenc ies and Medicaid and CHIP m ana ged ca re entities. O ne commenter recommended to f irst r equire state Medicaid pharmacy programs to focus on developing interoperable standards for AP I development and only requ ir e managed ca re entities to ad opt the standards onc e t he API ha s been t ested and scaled at the state level. Re sponse: We appreciate the commenters' concerns. We understa nd that our pr opose d timeframe o f one (1) busi ness day may be operationally challenging for states and m anaged care pla ns but c ontinue to be lieve that this tim e frame is critical in order for beneficiaries a nd prescribers to have this informati on as soon as th e information is applicable to coverage or in near r eal time sinc e this information could i mprove car e and health ou tcomes. We believe that timely da ta a re pa rticularly i mportant during urgent or emergency s ituations. We not e that having access to this information as soon as, or even before, i t is effective is necessary f or pa tients and their providers to make important decisions about which medications should be included in a patient's care plan. This is particularly important for patients who may not be able to cover a medicati on out of poc ket if it is not covered by their plan. Therefore, we are finalizing the timeframe. We decline to onl y appl y these requirements to s tate Medicaid programs (and decline to pos tpone a pplication of the tim eframe to managed c are plans unt il a future t ime as recommend ed by the commenter) because this approach would not be consistent with our goal of ensuring that the patients covered by the payers impacted by this requirement have access to the CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 120 specified data. We also note that we are providing a link to specific impl ementation guidance and reference implementations for all payers to fur ther support sharing the needed da t a u sing the required standards: https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and- Guidance/Guidance/Interoperability/index. We are finalizing these requirements for the API t o include for mulary inf ormation for MA or ganizations offering MA-PD plans, st ate Medicaid an d CHIP FFS programs, Medicai d managed care pla ns, and CHIP managed c are entities. In addition to comments about the specific types of information we proposed be made available through the Patient Access API, w e also r eceived c omments on addi tional types of informati on stakeholders would l ike to see included. We summ arize the public comments we received on this topic and provide our responses. Comment: Commenters ma de a nu mber of s uggestions for additional data to b e made avai lable to patients via the Patient A ccess AP I. Some of the data requested i s already i ncluded in the proposal and being finalize d for inclusi on a s proposed. In a ddition to these requests, a few c ommenters re commended C MS a lso re quire the inc lusion o f information regarding prior a uthorization decisions , drug pricing, and a dire ct phone number for patients to c all providers and their staff about prior authorization issues. A few c ommenters s p ecifically requested pr ior authorization decision informati on, including active prior au thorizations , be made ac cessible to patients ; a few other commenters s ug gested thi s prior authorization information be available to pr oviders. Commenters recommended future versions of the USCDI include additional data so that these data would be available via the P atient A cc ess API. A f ew commenter s r ecommended the USCDI i nclude social d eterminant s of he alth da ta. O ne commenter r ecommended C MS and ONC include additional immunization data elements from the CDC endorsed data elements for CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 121 immunization and the American Association's Funct ional Guide. One comme nter recommended C are Team D ata Class as well a s Data Class Provenanc e \"Author Health Profession\" be added. One commenter recommende d including coverage and explanation of benefit data to the USCDI per the C ARIN Alliance's Imple mentation Guide. A nother c ommenter recommended C MS i nclude data elements related t o administrative t ransactions. O ne commenter recommended the USCDI include Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) images in addition to the already included ima g ing not es. A fe w commente r s requested C MS spe cifically require the use of Systematized Nomenclature of D entistry (SNODENT) for dentistry findings, disorders, and diagnoses , versus making SNODENT opt ional as part of the proposed USCDI. A few commenters r e commended that additional care s ettings or provider types are considered for additional USCDI data classes in the future. These inc luded anesthesiology, registered dietitian nutritionists, a nd post- acute care settings (including hospice). O ne commenter recommended that the USC DI include additional FHIR-based pharmacy benefit standard- based formular y and drug benefit data . Another commenter requested that Admission, Discharge, and Transfer ( ADT) da ta classes and data elements be included i n the USCDI. O ne commenter recommended C MS w ork with the industry t o standardize unstr uctured encounter data. One commente r was c oncerned tha t the U SCDI includes da ta traditionally collected in E HRs a nd that data/standards for non-health care transactions are not included ( for example, hom e modifications). One c ommenter expressed concerns that the USCDI does not include the entire designated r ecord se t, such as images and genomi c test r eports and recommends this be included. Response: We a ppreciate the commenters' recommendations a nd will work w ith O NC t o evaluate these recommendations for possibl e future consideration, as appropriate and feasible. CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 122 We also received comments deta iling concerns with the volume of data being proposed to be made available through the Patient Access API. We summari ze the public comments w e received on this topic and provide our responses. Comment: A few commenters w e re concerned with the potential volume o f data tha t will be made available to pa tients through the Patient Access API. A f ew commenters requested C MS provide more information regarding the minimum information required t o be shared under our pol icies. One commenter suggested that an advisory panel determine the volume and types of inf ormation that patients should rec eive. Response: We appreciate the commenters' conc erns and r ecommendations. Regarding the data to be made available to patients, as noted in section III.C.2.b. of this final rule , to ensure cons istent implementation and minimize the burden on payers, we are finalizing i n the applicable r egulations additiona l text to specify that MA organizations at 42 CFR 422.119( h), state Medicaid FFS programs at 42 CFR 431.60( g), Medicaid managed care plans at 42 C FR 438.62(b)(1)(vii), CHIP FFS programs at 42 CFR 457.730( g), CHIP managed care entities at 42 CFR 457.12 33(d), and QHP issuers on the FFEs at 45 CFR 156.221(i), beginning January 1, 2021 (or beginning wit h plan years begi nning on or after January 1, 2021 for QHPs on the FFEs), m ust m ake available through the Patient A ccess API d ata they maintain w ith a date of servic e on or after January 1, 2016. We are also finalizing the same years of data be available t hrough the Patient Access API and for the payer -to-payer dat a exchange requirement discussed in section V . of this final rule. T hese pol icies s upport the ul timate goal to provide patients access to the ir cumulative health inf ormation. W e are finalizing as proposed the minimum content require d to be accessible th rough the Patient Access API in the regulation text at 42 CFR 422.119(b), remittances; enrollee c ost-sharing; a nd clinica l data (inc luding laboratory re sul ts) (where ma inta ined by the applicable payer), as well as formularies or preferred drug lists for all impacted pa yers e xcept QHP is s uers on the FFEs. A s discus sed above, t hese data must be shared u sing the content and vocabulary st and ards at 45 CFR 170.21 3, finalize d by HHS in ONC's 21st Century C ur es Act fina l rule (published elsew here in this issue of t he F ederal Register ) , and in 45 CFR part 162 and 42 CFR 423.160. We believe that pa tients have a right to their he alth car e i nformation so they can us e and share this information to best inform their health c are decisions. We appreciate t he recommendation to cr eate an advisory panel, and will evaluate it for potential future consideration. d. Documentation Requirements for APIs We proposed that the specific business and technical do cumentation ne cessary t o interact with the proposed APIs be m ade freely and publicly accessible. As discussed in section II.A.1 of the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access proposed rule (84 FR 7620) , we believed transparency about API technology is needed to ensure that any intereste d third-party application deve loper can easily obtain the information needed to develop applications technically compatible with the organization's API. Transparenc y is also needed s o t hat third- parties can unde rstand how to successfully interact with an organization's API . This includes how to satisfy any requirements the organizati on may establish for veri fying a developer's identit y and their appl ications' authenticity, consistent w ith the payer's s e curity ris k analysis a nd related organizational policies and procedures. In this way payers can ensure they maintain an appropriate level of privacy and security protection for data on their systems. CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 124 Specifically, at 42 and 45 C FR 156.221(d), we propos ed virtually identical text to require the reg ulate d entities to make com plete accompanying documentation regarding the API publicly accessible by posting this documentation directly on the applicable entity's website or via a publi cly accessible hyperlink. As previously discussed, Medicaid managed care plans would be require d by 42 C FR 438.242(b)(6) (fi nalized as \u00a7 438.242(b)(5) in this rule; see section VI.) to comply wit h the requirement at 42 CFR 431.60(d), and CHIP managed care entities would be required by 42 CFR 457.1233( d)(2) to comply with the requirement at 42 CFR 457.73 0(d) . In requiring that this documentati on be m ade \"publicly acc essible,\" we noted that w e expected that an y person us ing commonly available technology to br owse the In ternet could a ccess the information w ithout any pre conditions or additional steps beyond downloading and using a third- party a pplication to access data through the API. We also noted that this was not intende d to preclude use of links the user w ould clic k to review the full te xt of lengthy documents or access sources of additional information, such as if the technology's supplier prefers to host technical documentation at a centralized l ocation. Rather, w e meant \"addi tional st eps\" to include actions such as: collecting a fee fo r access to the documentation; requiring the reader to r eceive a copy of the material via email; or requiring the user to r ead pr omotional material or agree to r e ceive fut ure communications from the organization maki ng the documentation available. W e summarize the public comments received on our proposal regarding API documentation and provide our responses. Comment: Some commenters opposed the API documentation proposal indicating payers and providers will be required to provide data without a charge, but the freely and publicly CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 125 accessible documentation would enable applications to collect data and possibly sell the data back to payers and providers if needed for secondary uses such as provider directories. Some commenters supported fees for documentation noting the funds required to create and maintain data for sharing between payers and enrollees. Commenters believ ed third parties should be charged a fee to maintain the API. One commenter expressed concern that the business model of the third -party applications hinges on their ability to sell the data they collect for secondary uses while payers and providers would be required to provide information to vendors absent a fee. This commenter argued that charging third -party vendors a fee for documentation could be one way for vendors to absorb some of the cost of maintaining the API in exchange for the data they could potentially use to make a profit. Response : We also appreciate the concerns raised around the secondary uses of data shared with third -parties. We note that under section 5 of the FTC Act (15 U.S.C. Sec. 45(a)), it is considered a deceptive act to use a per son's sensitive information without disclosing in product documentation how this information will be shared.31 In addition, we do not believe that charging a fee to access API documentation is appropriate to offset secondary data use concerns. We refer rea ders to the additional discussion below regarding informing patients about potential secondary uses of data. The data that must be shared via the API under this policy are data that the payers have and must currently share with patients under existing law. The public directory data is already public information. We do not believe it is appropriate to charge a fee for documentation 31 See also cases where this authority was used, such as 2012 FTC action against Facebook (seehttps://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/cases-p roceedings/092-3 184/facebook -inc), the 058/myspace -llc-matter), to access such available data. Taking the example of provider directory data raised by commenters, c urrently there a re vendors that collect the publicly available directory data, clean these data, supplement these data, and offer this enhanced data product back to payers and providers. I t is not the data the vendors ar e cha rging for as much as it is the service of cleanin g and e nhancing these data. Vendors may generate revenue from their third-part y apps, but a major component of this is the service they are providing - buildi ng the app, making the dat a the patient di rects to t hem most us able and valuabl e - that ge nerates the revenue. P ayers m ust already make these data ava ilable to patients. T hese data alone may a lso drive revenue, but it is the patient's pr erogative to provide th e ir data to a third -party i n order to g e t a s ervice in exchange. B eing sure patients are as informed as possible about sec ondary uses of data and how this may impact them is important. A s a result , we discus s this issue more be low. Comment: Some commenters indicated support for permitting access to documentation without access fees, citing conc ern that the fees would be extended t o cons umers as well as l ogistical concerns for how they would be paid. A few com menters specifically recommended alignment with the ONC 21st Century Cures Act proposed rule API documentati on requirement by using the language included i n the discussi on of the proposed requirement at 45 C FR 170.315(g) (10) stating that the documentation should be \"a ccessible to the public vi a a hype rlink without additional access re quirements, inc luding, w ithout limitation, any form of registra tion, a ccount creation, 'click-through' agreements, or requirement to provide contact details or other informati on prior to accessing the docum entation\" (84 FR 7484) . Response : We do appreciate the requests to explicitly s tate what w e mean by \"publ ic access\" and ensure it i s cl ear this does not pe rmit any addi tional r estrictions or fees. A s a result, to further align with the discussion in the ONC 21st Century Cures Act proposed rule (84 FR CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 127 7477), and the CMS Interoperabilit y and Patient Access proposed rule (84 FR 7620) , we are finalizing regulation text sta ting that \"publicly a ccessible\" me ans we expect that any person using commonly available technology to browse the internet could access the information without any preconditions or addit ional steps, such a s a fee for acce ss to the documentation; a requiremen t to receive a copy of the ma terial via email; a requirement to register or create a n a ccount to receive the documentation; or a r e quirement to read pr omotional materia l or agree to rece ive future communications from the organization making the documentation available. We are finalizing this requirement at 42 CFR 422.11 9(d), 431.60(d), 438.242(b)(5) (through cross- FFS), 457.730(d), 457.1233(d)(2) (th rough cross- reference to CHIP F FS), and 45 CFR 156.221(d). Comment: One commenter did not support this documentation proposal for security reasons as the commenter believed that if the documentati on was public, a ny third-party or orga nization could potentially call, or connect t o, a payer's A PI. T his commenter preferred a n alternate approach where CMS st i pulates in order t o call an API, t here would n eed to be appropr iate security tokens in pl ace between the two pa rties engaged i n the data exchange. Respons e: We appreciate the commenters' concerns . We no te, how ever, that making the documentation available publicly does not impact the security of the standards- based A PI itself. This level of transparency is common in other industries and across standards, and has bee n shown to lead to innovation and competition. HL7 is built on free and open documentati on to ens ure that all developers can equally access information. Reviewing the documentation available for FHIR is one way of appreciating the value of this information and how having it freely accessible can allow innovators to engage with health care data in the most meaningful CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 128 ways.32 Having access to the documentation is not the same as access to the actual API for the purposes of data exchange. Appreciating the comments received and the need to have documentation available to ensure successful implementation and use of the Patient Access API, we are finalizing our proposal to make publicly accessible documentation that includes, at a minimum: (1) API syntax, function names, required and optional parameters supported and their data types, return variables and their types/structures, exceptions and exception handling methods and their returns; (2) The software components and configurations an application must use in order to successfully inter act with the API and process its response(s); and (3) All applicable technical requirements and attributes necessary for an application to be registered with any authorization server(s) deployed in conjunction with the API. As noted, we have made one modification by adding the definition of \"publicly accessible\" to the relevant regulation text. e.Routine Testing and Monitoring of Standards -based APIs At 42 CFR 422.119(c)(2), 431.60(c)(2), 457.730(c)(2), and 45 CFR 156.221(c)(2) for MA organizations, state Medicaid and CHIP FFS programs, and QHP issuers on the FFEs, respectively, we proposed that the API must be routinely tested and monitored to ensure it is functioning properly, including assessments to verify that the API is fully and successfully implementing privacy and security features such as but not limited to those required to comply with the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules, 42 CFR parts 2 and 3, and other applicable law protecting privacy and security of individually identifiab le health information. As proposed, Medicaid managed care plans would be required by 42 CFR 438.242(b)(6) (redesignated as 438.242(b)(5) in this final rule; see section VI. of this final rule) to comply with the requirement 32 HL7 International. (n.d.). FHIR Overview. Retrieved from https://www.hl7.org/fhir/overview.html. CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 129 at 42 CFR 431.60( c), and CHIP managed care entities would be require d by 42 CFR 457.1233(d) (2) to comply with the requirement at 42 CFR 457.730(c). Additionally, w e not ed that while federa l la ws th at regulate MA or gani zations and M A plans supersede any state law exc ept w here noted unde r section 1856(b)(3) of the Act , some state, loc al, or triba l laws tha t pertain to pr ivacy a nd security of individually id entifiable inf ormati on generally, and that are not spe cific to healt h insurance , m ay also appl y to MA orga nizations and MA plans in the context of the proposal. For the other entities regulated under the proposals in these various programs, we noted that we also intende d the phrase \"other a pplicable law\" to inc lude fe deral, s tate, t ribal or local laws th a t apply to the entity. W e proposed t his requirement to establish a nd m aintai n processes to routinely test and moni tor the standards -based APIs to ensure they are functioning properly, espe cially with r espect to the ir privacy a nd security fe atures. W e explained in the preamble o f the proposed ru le that under the proposal, MA organizations, Medicai d and CHIP FFS progr ams, Medicai d managed care plans, CHIP managed car e entities, and QHP issuers on the FFEs would ha ve to implement, prope rly maintain, update (as appropriate), a nd routinely test authentication featur es that w ill be used t o verify t he identity of individual enrollees w ho seek t o access their claims and enc ounter data and other PHI through the API. Similarly, as discusse d, compliance with the pro posed requirements w ould me an tha t these enti ties must i mplement, maintain, update (as appropriate), and routinely te st authorization featu res to e nsure a n individual enrollee o r their personal representative can onl y access claims and encounter da ta or other P HI th at be longs to t hat enrollee. As is the case under existing HIPAA Privacy Rule requirements, where an individual is also a properly designated personal representative of another enrollee , the HIPAA co vered entity must provide the personal representative appropriate access to the information about the enrollee CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 130 that has designated them as their personal representative, just as they would if the personal representative were the enrollee. We summarize the public comments we receive d on routine tes ting a nd monitoring and provi de our respons es. Comment: Several commenters supporte d the proposal to r equire that payer s routinely test and monitor the standards -base d A PI needed to meet the requirements of this proposal. One commenter recommended that this be self -regulated rather than mandated, however. A few commenters e xpressed concern w ith the requirement to te st and moni tor the A P I. A fe w a dditional commenters expresse d concern that ther e is no consensus on a comm on t esting envi ronment. One commenter believed that testing and monitoring will be costly. Several commenters urged CMS to provide additional information and guidance on any requirements for testing and monitoring APIs, includi ng the expecte d frequency of tes ting. A few commenters re quested a dditional information on whether payers w ill be require d to demonstrate com pliance by submitting or reporting on testi ng plans. One comm enter requested clarification on the process if an issue is found duri ng testing or monitoring. One commenter requested that CMS specify what \"routine\" means. Response: We appreciate the commenters' concerns and recommendations. We did not specify exactly at what intervals or frequency testing should be done, and thus did not quantify \"routine,\" as we believe it is important that payers put a process in place that works best for them to conduct testing and monitoring at regular intervals to ensure the required API remains in compliance and is working as expected. We will provide best practice information, including information on available API testing tools to support payers with this required activity. In our review of the proposed regulation text, we realized that the regulation text at 42 CFR CMS -9115-F )(2) did not specify the requirement to also upd ate (as appropriate) the API to ensure it functions properly a nd includes assessm ents to ve rify an their pe rsonal r epresentative can onl y access claims and encounter data or other PHI that belongs to that enrollee. We are finalizing additional text to thi s e ffect. W e are also removing the word \" min imally\" from this r egulation text in or der t o ens ure it is clear that p rivacy and security f eatures must be reasonable and appr opriate, consistent with th e requirements of the HIPAA S ecurity R u le. We no te that this te sting requiremen t is accounted for in sections X II. a nd XIII. of this final rule a s one of the e xpected steps of implementing and maintaining an API. T his is pa rt of the cost factored int o implementation of the API and is a necessary pa rt of using an A PI. It is a lso pa rt of current software development b est practices. P ayers implementing A P Is can i ncorporate testing tools into a comprehensive testing plan and continuous integration (CI) system, which can automatically va lidate adherenc e t o the implementation guide when cha nges ar e made to f urther mitigate th is cost. f. Compliance with Existing Privacy and Security Requirements In the hands of a HIPAA covered entity or its business associate, individually identifiable health information, including information in patient claims and encounter data, is PHI and protected by the HIPAA Rules. Ensuring the privacy and security of the claims, encounter, and other health information when it is transmitted through the API is important. Therefore, in the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access proposed rule (84 FR 7635), we reminded MA organizations, state Medicaid and CHIP FFS programs, Medicaid managed care plans, CHIP managed care entities, and QHP issuers on the FFEs that mechanisms and practices to release PHI, including but not limited to authorization and authentication protocols and practices, must CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 132 provide protection sufficient to comp ly with the HIPAA Rules a nd other privacy and security la w (w hether federal, s tate, t ribal, or local) that may a ppl y based on t he specific circumstances. A s proposed, the entities subject to these requirements would need to continuously ensure that all authorization a nd authentication me chanisms p rovide sufficient protections to e nro llee P HI and that they function as intended. We specifically requested public comment on whether existing privac y and s ecurity standards, including but not limite d to those in 45 CF R part 164, are sufficient with respect to these proposals, or whether additional privacy and security standards should be required by CMS as part of the proposal. We not e that comments and our responses related to privacy a nd securi ty i ssues, generally, can be found in section II.A.2. of this final rule. Here, we summarize the public comments we received o n privacy and security as it relates to consent, authenticati on, and ide ntity verification a nd provide our responses. Comment: A few commenters expressed concerns with using the proposed FHIR standards for obtaining patient consent, with some noting the lack of ma tu re consent m echanisms supporte d through FHIR. A few com menters expressed concerns that there are no mature or wi dely accepted standards for documenting patient consent electronically, generally. One commenter suggested that the patient be able to s ee their cons ent preferences and the types of data that have been authorized for sharing from a central location. One commenter recommended that CMS or OCR develop a standardized data sharing patient consent form that payers, providers, and health IT vendors can use to ensure appropriate consent. A few commenters recommended that CMS require payers and/or apps to use ONC's Model Privacy Notice. One commenter recommended that CMS and FTC should develop plain language consumer notifications that could be used by app developers. One commenter CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 133 recommended that C MS r equire payers to include in their en rollment pr ocess an ef ficient \"check of to release the ir inf ormation to the i r providers. A fe w commenters noted that it should be the responsibility of the app to verif y the patient's ability to pr ovide consent. Response : We appreciate the commenters concerns and recommendations, and w e have shared th ese w ith ONC for consideration. Regarding FHIR s tandards fo r consent, w e refer readers to discussi on in the ONC 21st Ce ntury Cures Act final rule (published elsewhere in this issue of the F ederal Register ), which considers the status of current development efforts around consent resources. We will continue to work with ONC and industry pa rtners to monitor the deve lopment of FHIR resources to support consent management. W e believe that t he security protocols at 45 CFR 170.215 are sufficient to authenticate users and authorize individuals to access their data maintained by pa yers in ac cordance with the r equirements described i n this rule and, therefore , provide the necessary consent mechanisms for payers to implement the policies in this rule. We appreciate the additional recommendations made regarding developing consent materials for all p ayers to use, as well as recommendations around the use of the ONC Model Privacy Notice. More information on available consent options can be found at https://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/cbcc/frs/, and ONC's Model Privacy Notice is available at https://www.healthit.gov/topic/privacy-s ecurity-a nd-hipaa/model-privacy-notice-mpn , which interested payers or app vendors can use. We will evaluate recommendations made that would add requirements on payers that we had not proposed, including any centralized solution, for possible future rulemaking. CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 134 Comment : Several commenters supported efforts to verify if an entity is authorized to access the data they are seeking. One commenter supported the proposed use of the OAuth standard. One commenter believes that the use of OAuth 2.0 for client application authorization and OpenID Connect for client application authentication should include authenticity, integrity, and non-repudiation standards. Another commenter suggested CMS permit flexibility in the implementation of security standards. A few commenters expressed concerns with using the proposed FHIR standards for identity proofing alone and supported additional measures, such as biometrics, be employed as well. A few commenters expressed concern about open-ended token access once initially authenticated and instead recommended CMS implement a 90-d ay timeframe for the authentication token to remain open. One commenter suggested that encryption of authentication credentials is not sufficient. One commenter believed that the only true means by which an individual can assert their identity is through a government-issued ID, and if this cannot be produced, the commenter noted several limitations that should be put in place to prohibit data sharing until further authentication can be done. Another commenter suggested CMS look into biometrics as a means for improving identity proofing. A few commenters recommended the use of multi-f actor authentication to verify the identification of an individual. A few commenters recommended requiring payers give their members an online way to self-e nroll for the necessary credentials to access their health information via an API. One commenter stated that this will reduce the time it takes for an organization to verify a request. One commenter recommended that this should apply to any of a payer's patients who have been a member in the past 5 years. One commenter expressed concern that without clear guidelines for CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 135 how patients can acce ss their da ta, pa tients may face barriers such as trying t o get authentication credentials , and trying to get an app a uthorized. A few commenters recommended CMS develop a common method to validate the i dentity a nd authority of the requ esting party. One commenter recommended CMS issue guidance on authenticating the requ estor that offers a simple , secure method to obtain authent ication across all entities. A f ew c ommenters suppor ted efforts t o develop methods to ver ify a caregiver f or a patient and allow that c aregiver to acc ess all he alth i nformation sys tems. Response : We appreciate the commenters' conc erns and recommendations. We are finalizing as proposed to require compliance with 45 CFR 170.215 as finalized by HHS in the ONC 21s t Century C ures A ct final rule (published elsewhe re in t his issue of the Federal Regist er). This requires use of HL7 FHIR Release 4.0.1, and complementary security and app registration pr otocols, s pe cifically the S MART A ppl ication Launch Imp lementation Guide (SMART IG) 1.0.0 (including mandatory support for the \"SMART on FHIR Core Capabilities\"), which is a p rofile of the OAuth 2.0 specification, and the Ope nID Connect Core 1.0 standard, incorporating errata set 1). Additional information and implementati on guidance can be found a t http://hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/. The goal of using these resources is to make authorization electroni c, efficient, and secure so that pa tients can acces s their he alth information as effortlessly as possible. We a gree th at multifactor authentication represents a b est practice for privacy a nd security i n health car e settings, and w e note that an important benefit of the OAuth 2.0 standard HHS is fina lizing is tha t it provides robust support for multifactor authentication. By re quiring that payers s ubjec t to our Patient Access A P I requirement use an A PI that is conformant with 45 CFR 170.215, where HHS has finalized the SMART IG, we are supporting the u se of multifactor CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 136 authentication. We also note that as part of ONC's 21st Century Cures Act final rule (published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register), HHS is finalizing a new provision in the ONC certification program that would require health IT developers to attest as to whether they support multifactor authentication, further encouraging adoption of such security practices. We also strongly encourage payers subject to the requirements in this final rule to employ robust privacy and security protocols, and use multifactor authentication, where appropriate. Multifactor authentication is industry accepted, routinely used across many sectors, known to patients, and a low burden option that could signi ficantly increase security. Though we appreciate commenters' requests to leave flexibility here, we do believe adopting the standards as finalized by HHS in ONC's 21st Century Cures Act final rule regarding the use of the SMART IG (using the OAuth 2.0 standard) and OpenID Connect Core 1.0 is an important starting point. In addition, w e note that t he technical standards at 45 CFR 170.215 address the comments regarding tokens, as HHS is finalizing use of tokens at 45 CFR 170.215 as part of the SMART IG. We note that ONC is requiring that a token be valid for at least 3 months for certified health IT; we encourage payers subject to this final rule to align with t his best practice. We appreciate recommendations fo r a centralized solution to patient authentication and identity proofing, and caregiver access, and will take these under consid eration as appropriate. Comment: Many commenters expressed that patients should have ultimate authority and the ability to consent to what type of information can be shared as well as who can access their health information. One commenter recommended C MS require that patients have the ability to filter or request only the specific data th at they want to be shared. One commenter requested that CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 137 payers be able to a ccess the specifi c types of data a patient authorized t he app t o acc ess. O ne commenter adde d patients should a l so ha ve an ac counting of disclosur es or acce ss to their da ta. A few commenters expressed con cerns over the sharing of patient el ect ronic health information with he alth c are p roviders tha t the patient has no t consented t o share w ith. A fe w commenters e xpressed specific c oncerns with s haring e lectronic he alth in formation beyond the immediate health care provider, such as with providers with which a patient may b e seeking a second opinion or additional care. One commenter was concerned with the sharing of family he alth h istory da ta pa rticularly for family members w ho have not consented. A few com menters recommende d that providers be able to pre-filter o r s elect which da ta can be made ava ilable to the patient, citing conc erns with t he sens itivity of some pr ovider notes or patient confusion in interpreting certa in inf ormation. A fe w commenters a ls o suggested th at pr oviders be able to select which information can be ma de available to the payer. R esponse : We appreciate the commenters' conc erns and suggestions. Collectively, HHS has been w orking to evaluate various t echnical sp ecifications for dat a segmentation to en hance privacy protections and comply with appli cable law (such as laws regarding privac y for minors or 42 CFR part 2). Bot h HHS and the indus t ry as a whole ar e currently ev alua ting future use cases related to segm enting data at the patient request. A t this time, how ever, t he policies as they are be ing finalized unde r this ru le require that the pa yers, w ith the approval and at the direction of t he patient, provide all of the data as specifie d in the applicable re gulation text. Beyond this, payers, providers, and p atients cannot direct spe cific segments of data be m ade available via this Patient Access API. The necessary technical sp ecifications to allow a patient to request some CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 138 data elements be shared but not others are not widely adopted.33 If the patient requests their data via the Patient Access API from a payer, the payer must make available all of the data allowed per current law, such as 42 CFR part 2 and relevant state laws, including the data as specified in this final rule. We reiterate, however, that the data that are available to be shared are only to be shared at the patient's request. If there are data elements the patient does not want to be shared, they can choose not to make the request. In addition, we note that this policy allows data to be exchanged from the payer to a third-party app of the patient's choice for their personal use. This rule does not require any data exchange d irectly between or with providers. Specifically regarding the comment on sharing family history, we note that the health information required to be shared under this policy includes claims and encounter data as well as the data included in the USCDI version 1. At this time, \"family history\" is not a specific data class within the USCDI. As a result, we do not believe this should be an issue under this current policy. We will, however, take this into consideration as we consider future policy options. We appreciate the recommendation for patients to have a full record of disclosures or access to their health information via the API. At present, the HIPAA Privacy Rule requires accountings of certain disclosures. Consistent with the spirit of this accounting of disclosures, we encourage payers to consider setting up functionality to allow patients to view a record of when and with whom their data have been shared via the API. Comment: Many commenters expressed concerns over the complexity with parsing or segmen ting electronic health information that is considered sensitive and/or is subject to 42 CFR part 2 rules. Commenters requested CMS take into account these situations with these API 33 For information on adoption levels for technical specifications related to data segmentation, see the Interoperability Standards Advisory at https://www.healthit.gov/isa/data-s egmentation-s ensitive -information. CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 139 proposals and cited use cases such as women's health, sexual health, young adult health, mental health, and substanc e abuse treatment. A few commenters noted conc erns that so me he alth care providers m ay di scriminate or treat a pa tient differently if the y were able to access c ertain patient's health in formation. A fe w commenters re commended that HHS align part 2 and HIPAA re gulations . One commenter re commended the use of the Consent2Share (C2S) FHIR Consent Profile developed by SAMHSA. Another commenter suggested CMS defer adopti on of the Data S egmentation for Privacy s tandards until a n API FHIR s tandard ve rsion i s fina lized a nd the Consent2Share guide is revise d to conform to that vers ion. Response : We appreciate the commenters concerns and recommendations. We are currently evaluating future options around parsing or segmenting data, generally, using the API. As noted above, HHS is collectivel y working to explore sta ndards and technical supports for data segmentation for privacy and consent management and point commenters to the ONC 21st Century C ures A ct fina l rul e fo r additional d i scussion on t his. We also no te that u sing the appropriate FHIR profiles, such as those being finalized by HHS in the ONC 21st Century Cures Act final rule (published elsewhere in t his issue of the F ederal Register) for API technical standards , including t he SMART IG (using the OAuth 2.0 standard) and OpenID Connect as f inalize d at 45 CFR 170.215, ca n be leveraged to support this. Again, we note that additional information and implementation guidance can be found at http://hl7.org/fhir/smart- app-launch/. However, we reiterate that payers' privacy and security obligations under the HIPAA Rules and 42 CFR pa rt 2 a re not impacted by th is fin al rule. Com ment : A few commenters e xp ressed pa rticular concern fo r approp riate authorization of parent/guardian p roxies for minor patients. O n e c ommenter recommended C MS a lign the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access proposed rule with the Children's Online Privacy CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 140 Protection Act (COPPA), which was created to protect the privacy of children under 13 and has been in effect since 2000. Response : We appreciate the commenters concerns and recommendations, which we are reviewing for future possible consideration in regulation. We note that this current regulation does not change any existing privacy relationships between minors and parents. If, for instance, a teenage minor has asserted their protections to not have their guardians see their Explanation of Benefits, the payer would be obligated to maintain these protections when sharing data via the API. For non-minor dependents, again the existing policies hold true. Regarding privacy in an enrollment group, at this time, a policyholder can see the claims for all members of their enrollment group unless there is an agreed upon privacy provision available and in place. The HIPAA Privacy Rule states at 45 CFR 164.522 that individuals have a right to request restrictions on how a covered entity will use and disclose protected health information about them for treatment, payment, and health care operations. However, a covered entity is not generally required to agree to an individual's request for a restriction unless certain limited exceptions are met 34, but is bound by any restrictions to which it does agree. After the Affordable Care Act extended the age that group health plans and issuers of health insurance coverage in the group or individual market that offer dependent coverage of children must continue to make such coverage available to adult children until age 26, some states, including California, Colorado, Washington, Oregon, and Maryland, have enacted stricter protections regarding privacy rights, and although all of these states operate their own SBEs and issuers on these Exchanges are not implicated in this rule, to the extent issuers are operating in both these and FFE states and have applied their privacy policies across markets, consumers in FFE states 34 See 45 CFR 154.522(a)(1)(vi) for a discussion of the limited exceptions. CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 141 may a lso be nefit from these s t ricter protections. T his final rule doe s not alter obligations unde r a ny exist ing federal , state, loc al, or tribal law. A ga in, we note that this data shari ng is currently ongoi ng; the A PI just provides a n additional way to fa c ilitate this e xchange. g. Issues Related t o Den ial or D iscontinuation of Access to t he API We believe patients ha ve a righ t to their health information. H owever, a c overed e ntity is not expe cted to tolerate unacceptable levels of risk to the PHI held by the covered entity in its systems, as determine d by its own risk analysis . Accordingly, it may be appr opriate for an organization to deny or terminate specific applications' connecti on to its API unde r cer tain circumstances in w hich t he application poses an unacceptable risk to the PHI on its systems. At 42 see 457.1233( d)(2) and 45 CFR 156.22 1(e) for MA organizations, st ate Medicaid and C HIP F FS programs, M edicaid managed care plans, CHIP managed c are entities, an d QH P i ssuers on the FFEs, respectively, we prop osed to specify the circumstances under w hich t hese regulated entities, w hich ar e all H IPAA cove red en tities subject to HIPAA p rivacy and security re qu irements, m ay de c line to establish o r may te rminate a th ird- party a pplication's c onn ection to the covered e n tity's A PI while remaining in c omp liance w ith t he proposed requirement to offer patients access through standards- based A PIs. We noted in the CM S Interoperability and Patient Access proposed rule that we intended for the proposal to be consistent with the HIPAA R ules, and w e noted t hat these circumstanc es apply t o specific applications, rather than the third party itself ( 84 F R 7635 through 7636). Spe cifically, we proposed that a payer subject to our API pro posal could deny a ccess to the API if th e pa yer reasonably de te rmined that allowing that application t o connect or re main connected to the API would present an unacceptable level of risk to the security of PHI on the CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 142 payer' s systems. We further proposed t hat t his determina tion would be made consistent with the payer's H IPAA S ecurity R ule obl igations on obj e ctive, ve rifiable c riteria that would be applied f airly and co nsistently across all app lications through which en rollees seek t o acce ss thei r electronic he alth informati on as defined a t 45 CFR 171.102, i ncluding but not limited to criteria that may rely on automated moni toring a nd risk mi tigation tools. Where we proposed t o require access through s tandards- based APIs to ot herwise pub lic ly ava ilable informati on, s uch as provider directories, t he entities subject t o the proposal may al so de ny or terminate an application's connecti on to the API whe n it makes a similar determination about risk to its systems . However, depending on how the organization's systems are designed and conf igured, w e recognize that t he cr i teria and tolerable risk levels appropriate to a ssessing an application for connection to a n API for access to publ icly a vailable in formation may differ from thos e required f or API access to non -published pe rsonally id entifiable in for mation (PII). We also anticipated that, w here an ap plication's connection has been t erminated und er the se circumstances, it might be feasible in so me instances for t he organization to allow t he applicati on to reconnect to the API if and when the flaw or compromise of the application has been addressed sufficiently that the organizati on can no longer fai rly say the application's API connection continues t o pose an unacceptable ri sk. We summarize the public comments we received on denial or discontinuation of service and provide our responses. Comment: Several commenters supported the proposal to allow payers to deny or discontinue access to apps that pose security risks. One commenter specifically supported that the proposal does not allow payers to deny requests based on concerns about the worthiness of CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 143 the third -party as a recipient of PHI, because patients have the right to share their health information with the app they choose. Several commenters encouraged CMS to develop and/or further define guidelines for identifying \"unacceptable risk\" and establish a clearer standard for acceptable circumstances when API access can be restricted or denied. A few commenters expressed concerns that the proposed requirements may be interpreted differently among payers, apps, users, and providers. One commenter exp ressed conc ern b ecause payers are liable for breaches t hat oc cur duri ng data exchange and the commenter does not believe the proposal provides clear authorit y to deny access based on such sec urity conc erns. A f ew commenters requested that CMS p rovi de more informati on regarding whether paye rs may dela y and/or deny certain apps that are sus pected, or proven to be bad actors . One commenter re quested that CMS make the distinction between the risk posed by providi ng PHI and providing other widely available paye r data. A few commenters requested C MS de fine a t ime period for how long t he ban on access may remain in p lace. O ne commenter sought additional information on whether payers will be able to deny third-party access across the board for all pat ient queries and plans . A few commenters suggested that C MS should develop a clear process for app developers to follow in the event that a covere d entity denies access to an A PI. A few commenters recommended that CMS inc lude in the final ru le a reference t o ONC's information blocking definition and clarify that unac ceptable levels of risk could be an exception to information blocking. Response : We appreciate the commenters' concerns. As discussed in the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access proposed rule, the criteria and process for assessing unacceptable risk to a payer's system are part of the payer's responsibilities under the HIPAA Security Rule (84 FR 7635). The HIPAA Security Rule requires a covered entity to perform risk CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 144 analysis as part of its security management processes.35 HHS makes a number of tools available to assess risk.36 Additional tools are available through the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).37 We note th at this policy regarding denial or discontinuation of service refers to a payer's determination that allowing access to their API by a third party would result in risk to their system. As also noted previously, covered entities, in accordance with HIPAA privacy and security obligations, should take reasonable measures to protect data in transit, unless an individual expressly asks that the information be conveyed in an unsecure form or format (assuming the individual was warned of and accepted the risks a ssociated with the unsecure transmission). As explained in this section above, it is the responsibility of payers to assess the risk to their system and act accordingly regardless of whether the data being accessed via the API is PHI or not. If the concern is the security of the payer's system, the type of data being transferred is not at issue. Absent an individual's instruction to disregard in -transit security, if while assessing the security of the app's connection to the API, the covered entity determin es the data could be compromised in transit, the payer could discontinue or deny access in order to project the ePHI on its system. Again, this assessment must be based on objective, verifiable criteria in accordance with obligations under the HIPAA Security Rule. Having considered comments, we are finalizing that payers may deny or discontinue any third- party application's connection to their API if the payer reasonably determines, consistent with its security analysis under 45 CFR part 164 subpart C, that allowing an application to connect or remain connected to 35 45 CFR 164.308(a)1)(ii)(A). 36 For more information, see https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-p rofessionals/security/index.html. 37 Brooks, S., Garcia, M., Lefkovitz, Ligth man, & Nadeau, E. (2017, January). NISTIR 8062 An Introductio n to Privacy Engineering and Risk Management in Federal Systems. Retrieved from https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2017/NIST.IR.8062.pdf. CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 145 the API would pr esent an una cceptable le vel of risk to the security o f protected he a lth informati on on the payer's sys tems or in transit in instances in which the individual did not tell the payer to disregard in-trans it ris k. F or example, w here a n individual requests th at t heir unenc rypted ePHI be transmitte d to an app, the paye r would not be responsible for una uthorized access to the individual's ePHI w hile in transmission to the app. Whe n acc ess ha s been denied or discontinued due to security concerns, we encourage payers and third parties to work together to address the concerns if and as possible to be st serve patients. We are not a ble to set a specific time period or process for this as it i s beyond our authorit y, however, we do note that the HI PAA Privacy Rule requires access to be provided t o the individual in a ti mely manner. Regarding inf ormati on blocking, we ref er readers to the ONC 21st Century Cures Act final rule (published elsewhere in this issue of the F ederal Register ). C omment : One commenter requested tha CMS indi cate w hethe r third-party a pplications w ill be subject to HIPAA or FTC regulations. One commenter requeste d informati on about whe ther patients w ill be able to terminate th ird -party ac cess to their he alth data. Re sponse : We a ppreciate the c ommenters' request for more information. We refer c ommenters to O CR a nd FTC for additional information a bout jurisdiction ove r third -party apps. We do note, as discussed ear lier, t hat under section 5 of the FTC Act (15 U.S.C. Sec . 45(a)) , the FT C does regulate such third-part y apps. Regarding a pati ent's ability to terminate third-party ac cess, this would be some thing determined i n the terms and condi tions of each app. Comment : A few commente r s recommende d that covere d pa yers should have the flexibility to establish a dditional terms a nd conditions when de nying third-party applications access to their systems. One commenter stated that payers should be able to develop their own validation process for enrollees and have the right to not release the data where the full scope CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 146 cannot be validated. One commenter stated the payers should be able to refuse to c onnect to non- vetted apps. Another commenter stated tha t payers s hould be able to restrict ac cess if t he informati on exchanged is not perm itted under the HIPAA Privacy Rule or if the exchange or use would c ompromise the c onfidentiality, integrity, a nd availability o f the information. O ne commenter recommended that C MS allow cove red entities to r emove an app from the ir system if the app does not follow the approved privacy policy. One commenter recommende d that provide rs should be allowed t o require a business assoc i ate agreement (BAA) w i th t hird-party app developers that connect to the API re quired under this final rule. One commenter suggested allowi ng restrictions on data mining. How ever, one commenter expressed concer n that payers m ay place unnecessar y barriers a nd burdens on third-part y app developers. The comm enter encourage d CMS to ensure tha t payers cannot pl ace additional cons traints on apps, such as requiring a BAA, additional security audits, or requiring that apps make commitments about how it will or will not use the information patients store on it. Response : We appreciate the commenters' recommendations. Specifically, regarding the ability to deny access to a third-party app, we are finalizing this policy as proposed with one modification to add additional clarity around what it means to reasonably determine risk. As such, and as noted above, we are finalizing that payers may deny or discontinue any third-party application's connection to their API if the p ayer reasonably determines, consistent with its security analysis under 45 CFR part 164 subpart C, that allowing an application to connect or remain connected to the API would present an unacceptable level of risk to the security of protected health information on the payer's systems and the payer makes this determination using objective, verifiable criteria that are applied fairly and consistently across all applications and developers. As patients have a right to their data and this proposal provides the payers the CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 147 ability to appropriately protect their systems and the data they hold on it, we do not believe any additional restrictions are needed at this time. We also note it would not be appropriate to require a patient -designated third party to enter into a BAA with a payer as the API-facilitated exchange is taking place per the request of the patient and not by, on behalf of, or in service to the payer.38 In addition, we reiterate that it is beyond our authority to regulate third parties directly. We do note that under section 5 of the FTC Act (15 U.S.C. Sec. 45(a)), it is considered a deceptive act to use a person's sensitive information without disclosing in product documentation how this information will be shared. We do, however, believe patient privacy and security are vitally important. As a result, we lay out an option for payers to ask a third- party app to attest to certain privacy provisions, to help make patients aware of the privacy risks associated with their choices, as detailed in the next section. Comment: Several commenters had suggestions on how to further this proposal. A few commenters recommended that CMS could require apps to attest to certain privacy and security provisions, and if they did not, payers could deny access to the API. One commenter recommended that payers be required to vet third- party applications centrally, rather than requiring vetting for every payer and plan. A few commenters expressed concern that it will be significantly burdensome for payers and providers to vet every app that patients may choose to use in support of more central vetting. One commenter suggested that app developers should be able to proactively request to be vetted by a payer, even if the app developer has not received a request from a member. Many commenters recommended CMS and/or HHS establish a certification, independent verification, or vetting process for third -party applications and vendors that would vet or test 38 See 45 CFR 164.103 Definitions, regarding functions of business associate. CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 148 apps for certain functions, including privacy and security assurances. As an alternative, one commenter recommended CMS require apps generate an accounting of disclosures or join a trusted exchange network. A few com menters requested C MS sh are its best practi ces w ith app aut horization and access under the Blue Button 2.0 i nitiative. A f ew commenters recommended C MS, or the pa yers pre-approve and/or maintai n a list of a pproved apps in order for them to access data. Several commenters supported CMS' proposal t o allow patients to s elect any app of their choice. One commenter recommended that providers and payers be require d to authenticate the apps the ir patients choose to use to ga in access. One commenter recommended tha t third-party application should be clear in the ir terms and c onditions when a consumer downloads an app, and if they are not, a payer shou ld not be required t o interface with the app. O ne commenter recommended that the proposal for payers to deny or terminate specific a pplications from connecting to its API if the ris k pos ed to its s ystems is unacceptable should be extende d to hospitals , he alth systems, and other heal th care providers. One commenter suggested that payers should be required to consider the security r isks related to pr ovider EHR systems when determining whether to deny or terminate a third- party application. One commenter recommended that CMS develop three options for den ial of an application: denial at each API endpoint, centralized application denial, or no denial . One commenter s uggeste d that CMS coul d consider allowing providers to voluntarily see k assurances or ce rtifications that third- parties are abiding by the API's terms. Re sponse : We appreciate the commenters' recommendations, and w e appr eciate the concerns raised around privac y and security and the disc ussion regardi ng additional steps we can take to protect patient health information. We note that hospitals, health systems, and other CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 149 health care providers ar e considered c overed en tities unde r HIPAA, and the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules apply. We do appreciate that app vetting, i n particular, is an is sue of great interest to payers and providers . We note that we st rongly value the role that industry can pla y in this capacity, and w e s upport efforts w ithin in dustry to facilitate e fficient and effective, publ icly a ccessible i nformati on on vette d a pps and vendors. We believe industry is in the best position to collectivel y find the best wa ys to identif y those apps wit h strong privacy and security practices. We also appreciate the commenters' request for best pr actices learned through our experience w ith Blue Button 2.0. You can fi nd this information at https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and- G uidance/Guidance/Interoperability/index. We are not going to pursue the recommendation to devel op a CMS or HH S app certification program. Under our c ur rent authorities, we do not believe we have the ability to require a th ird-party app to take part in such a certification program. We do appr eciate that, ab ove all else, stakeholders commented on privacy and secur ity a nd the need to do more to protect patient health informati on. Throughout this rul e we have noted the limitations to our authority to di rectly regulate th ird- party applications. We have als o explained that w e are finalizing that payers can d eny API acc ess to a third -party app that a patient w ishes to us e only i f the payer asses ses that suc h access would pos e a risk t o the PHI on the ir sys tem. We appreciate, how ever, t hat more needs to be done. In the ONC 21st Century Cures Act final rule (published elsewhere in this Federal Register), ONC notes that it is not information blocking to inform a patient about the advantages and disadvantages and any associated risks with sharing their health information with a third party. In this rule, we are finalizing that impacted payers must share educational resources with CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 150 patients to h elp the m be informed s tewards of their health inf ormation and unde rstand the poss ible risk of sharing their data w it h third-party app s. As discussed abov e, commenters believe it is a risk when patients do not unde rstand what h appens after their da ta leaves the protection of HIP AA a nd are transmitted to a th ird-pa rty app. Commenters were specifically concerne d about secondar y uses of data. A clear, p lain l anguage privacy po licy i s the primary w ay a patient can be infor med about how thei r information will be protected and how it will be used once shared with a third-party app. Taking into consideration comments indicating strong public support for additional privacy and security measures, we are further building off of the privacy and security policies we are finalizing in this rule by asserting that MA organizations, Medicaid FFS programs, Medicaid managed care plans, CHIP FFS programs, CHIP managed care entities, and QHP issuers on the FFEs are encouraged, b ut are not required, to request third-p arty apps attest to having cer tain privacy and security provisions included in their privacy policy prior to providing the app access to the payer's API. If a payer chooses, they can ask that the apps requesting a ccess to their API with the approval and at the direction of the patient to attest that important provisions that can help keep a patient's data private and secur e are in place. Explaining cer tain practices around privacy and security in a patient-friendly, easy-t o-read privacy policy helps inform patients about an app's practices for handling their data. It helps patients understand if and how the app will protect their health information and how they can be an active participant in the protection of their information. Also, as explained earlier in this final rule, if an app has a written privacy policy and does not follow the policies as written, the FTC has authority to intervene. As a result, we assert that impacted payers can, but are not required to, ask a third-p arty app to attest that: CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 151 The app has a publicly available privacy policy, written in plain language,39 that has been affirmatively shared with the patient prior to the patient authorizing app access to their health information. To \"affirmatively share\" means that the patient had to take an action to indicate they saw the privacy policy, such as click or check a box or boxes. The app's privacy policy includes, at a minimum, the following important information:++ How a patient's health in formation may be accessed, exchanged, or used by any person or other entity, including whether the patient's health information may be shared or sold at any time (including in the future); ++ A requirement for express consent from a patient before the patient's health information is accessed, exchanged, or used, including receiving express consent before a patient's health information is shared or sold (other than disclosures required by law or disclosures necessary in connection with the sale of the appli cation or a similar transaction); ++ If an app will access any other information from a patient's device; or ++ How a patient can discontinue app access to their data and what the app's policy and process is for disposing of a patient's data once the patient has withdrawn consent. Payers can look to industry best practices, including the CARIN Alliance's Code of Conduct 40 and the ONC Model Privacy Notice41 for other provisions to include in their attestation request that best meet the needs of their pati ent population. If a payer chooses to request third -party apps provide this attestation, the payer must not discriminate in its implementation, including for the purposes of competitive advantage. Specifically, if a payer 39 Plain Language Action and Information Network. (2011, May). Federal Plain Language Guidelines. Retrieved from https://www.plainlanguage.gov/media/FederalPLGuidelines.pdf. 40 See is attestation of one app, it must re quest it of all apps that seek to obtain data. If the third -party app does not a ttest that their privacy polic y meets the provis ions indicated by the payer, th e payer may inf orm patients tha t the app did n ot attest and advise the m to reconsid er using this third-party a pp. The notificati on to the patient shou ld make it clear that the app has not atteste d to having the bas ic privacy and securit y protections and indicate what those ar e, and that the patient should exercise caution before opting to disclose their information t o the app. If the pa tient st ill request s the payer m ake t heir da ta available to the third -party app, the payer must provide API access to the app unless doing so would endanger the security of PHI on the payer's systems. T his process should not overly delay the patient's access. If the app does not attest positively or at all, the payer must work to quickly inform the patient and provide a short w indow for the patient t o canc el their r equest t he da ta be shared. If the patient doe s not actively respond, the payer must move forward as the patient has already directed their data be shared and this initial request must be honored. We believe it is important for patients to have a clear understanding of how their health information may be used by a third-party, as well as how to stop sharing their health information with a third-party, if they so choose. We believe the use of this attestation, in combination with patient education, will help patients be as informed as possible while providing payers with a lower burden vetting option. We believe this will better help protect patient privacy and security and mitigate many of the concerns raised. Together, this framework and the requirement for payers to provide patients with educational resources will help continue to move us toward a safer data exchange environment. This is a critical focus for CMS, and we look forward to continuing to work with stakeholders to keep patient privacy and data security a top priority. h. Enrollee and Beneficiary Resources Regarding Privacy and SecurityCMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 153 As discussed in secti on II.A. of the CMS Int eroperability and Patient Access proposed rule (84 FR 7618 through 7623), we are committed to maximizing enrollees' access to and control ove r their health i nforma tion. We noted that we believed this calls for prov iding enrollees that w ould a ccess data under the proposal with essentia l information about the privacy a nd s ecurity of their information, and what to do if they believe they have been misled or deceived about an application's terms of use or privacy policy. At 42 CFR 422.119(g) , 431.60(f), and 457.730(f), and 45 CFR 156.221( g), w e proposed to require MA organizations, st ate Medicaid and CHIP F FS programs, Me dicaid managed care pla ns, CHIP managed care entities, a nd QHP issuers on t he FFEs, t o make available to their current and forme r enrollees c ertain i nformation a bout: factors to c onsid er in s electing a health informati on management appli cation, practical strategies to help them safeguard the privacy and security of their data, and how to submit complaints to OCR or FTC. The proposed obligations would apply to Medicaid managed care plans a nd CHIP managed care entities thr ough c ross- re proposed in 42 (finalized as \u00a7 438.242(b)(5) in this final rule; see section VI. of this final rule) and \u00a7 457.1233(d)(2). The general information about the steps individuals can take to help protect the privacy and security of their health information should not be limited to, but should specifically include and emphasize the importance of understanding the privacy and security practices of any application to which they entrust their data. Information about submitting complaints should include both specific contact information fo r the OCR and FTC complaints processes and a brief overview, in simple and easy-to-understand language, of: what organizations are HIPAA covered entities, OCR's responsibility to oversee compliance with HIPAA, and FTC's complementary CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 154 responsibility to take action against unfair or deceptive practices, including by non- covered entities that may offer direct -to-consumer health information management applications. We proposed that this informati on must be made available on t he website of the pay ers subject to the proposed requirement , and thr ough other appropriate me chanisms through which the payer ordinarily c ommunicates w ith enrollees tha t are s eeking to access the i r health informati on held by the payer. This could include cust omer portals, online customer service help desks, and other locations, such as any portals through which enrollees and former enrollees might request disclosure of their data to a th ird-p arty application thr ough the payer's API. We a lso proposed that the payer must make this information available in non-technical, simple, and easy to understand language. We explained in the proposed rule how we anticipate that payers could meet the requirement to provide information to current and former enrollees in whole or in part using materials designed for consumer audiences that are available on the HHS website. However, we noted that whether the organization chooses to draft its own resource materials to provide the required information or to rely on governmental or other sources for such materials, the organization will b e responsible for ensuring that the content of the materials is adequate to inform t he patient regarding the privacy and security risks, and that it remains current as relevant law and policy may evolve over time. We sought comment on the proposal, and we invited additional comments on what specific information resources in addition to those already available on the websites noted above would be most useful to entities in meeting this requirement. We anticipated using this feedback to help inform HHS planning and prioritization of informational resource development work in addition to making a decision on the final rule regarding the proposal. CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 155 We summarize the public comments we received on enrollee resour ces and provide our responses. Comment : Several com menters supporte d the enrollee re sources proposal that would require payers to make informati on available t o consumers about selecting an app, safeguarding data, a nd submitting c omplaints. S evera l c ommenters supported the recommendation that the resour ces be available in cons umer -friendly language and be presented i n a way that is ea sy for consumers to understand. One commenter requeste d more informati on about whether paye rs may make the educational information available th rough electronic di sclosures, s uch as emailing the information to enrollees, in a ddi tion to ma king th e inf ormation a va ilable o nline. Response : We appreciate the commenters' support. We do note that payers may share the informati on through other appropr iate mechanisms usually used to communi cate with pa tients, such as secure e- mail, as w ell as include the information on a payer w ebsi te. Comment: A few commenters recommende d that CMS provi de patient education resources to help patients unde rs tand the information available to t hem through the payers' APIs. These commenters expressed con cerns that pa tients may not fully und er stand the con text of the da ta, suc h as detailed claims inf ormation that may not be intuitive to understand. Several commenters expr essed concern w ith consumers' lack of knowledge abou t the privacy and security of the ir health i nf ormation as it relates t o thi rd pplications. S e veral commenters expr essed concer n that consumers may not understand that their healt h information is not protected by HIPAA once the informati on is sent to a non- cov ered th ird-party app or how an app may use their health information. Many commenters recommended that CMS develop and/or support education for consumers. Several commenters stated that CMS should have the responsibility to develop CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 156 educational materials, rather than the payers or providers. Many commenters recommended that CMS collaborate with other regulatory agencies , including OCR and the FT C, to provide consumer education and notification materials . Seve ral commenters recommended that CMS and other H HS age ncies develop a campaign to edu cate patients ab out the privacy and security o f hea lth information, including the risks and cha llenges when connecting to third- party app s as well as differences between H IPAA and non-HIPAA covered entit ies and h ow the differences may affect how their data are used, stored, and shared. Specifically, a few commenters recommende d that CMS and F TC should require that third -party app developers inf orm consumers that HIPAA privacy rules will not apply when they agree t o sha re their da ta with apps and de scribe how they w ill us e the consumer's data. O ne commente r recommended tha t edu cationa l materials in clude i nformation on the differences be tween HIPAA and FTC protections. One commenter recommende d that CMS, OCR , or FTC publi sh the resources on their website and m aintain a complaint portal. A few commenters stated that it is the responsibility of all stakeholders to inform consumers o f their right s and use of PHI. One com menter recommended that the responsibility of providing educational materials to the consumer should fall on an organization where the pat ient may have a longer- term, no n- transactional r elationship, such as an HIE. Several commenters expressed concern that educational resources will not be enough to promote privacy and security. Several commenters recommended that CMS and ONC should require third-party apps to provide notifications on how they may use, share, or sell their health information. One commenter expressed concern that there will not be enough oversight over third-p arty apps. The commenter recommended that CMS use HIPAA as a framework for developing a privacy structure for third-party apps. CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 157 Response : We appreciate the commenters' conc erns and recommendations. We agree it is important to help ensure patients fully understand their health information, their rights, and the implications of sharing t heir inf ormation. It is also impor tant pa tients kno w what to do if there is a breach o f their health information. We a ppreciate tha t it would e liminate s ome bur den from payers and providers if w e assist w ith the production of the educational m at erials needed for the pur poses of the requirements in this final rule. As a res ult, CMS is providing suggested content for educational materials tha t payers c an us e to tailor to th eir pa tient population and share w ith pa tients. W e are finalizing the requirement with m odi fication that payers m ust publish o n the ir w ebsites the necessary educational informati on, but we will help suppl y t he content needed to me et this requirement. The sugges ted c ontent we a re providing for the educational materials w ill be shar ed through our norm al communication channels including via listservs and is available via our website: https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and- Guidance/Guidance/Interoperability/index. T he modification we are ma king is to refine the la nguage i n the regulation text to expressl y s tate that paye rs must include a discussion about a third -party app's se condary uses of data when providing factors to consider in selecting an applicati on at 42 CFR 422.119( g)( 1), 431.60(f)(1), and 457.730(f)(1), and 45 , w e are modifying the regulation text to state the payer must make these materials available in an easily accessible location on its public website. We note, however, that our authority is limited to helping payers educate patients about their privacy and security rights and where they can go for additional information. We have shared commenter feedback with our federal partners and will continue to work with all stakeholders to ensure patients, providers, and payers have the information they need to address CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 158 privacy and security i ssues relevant t o the regulations finalized in t his r ule. We will also cont inue c oordinating with O NC a nd a ll of our federal partners th rough the Federa l Health IT Coor dinating Council and ot her federal pa rtnering opportunities to ens ure we are tracking the impact of this final rule together , as appropriate . P rivacy a nd security, however, is a muc h larger issue, and we remind commenters that CMS does not have authority t o regulate third-part y a pps or thei r developers or develop privacy frameworks that exceed the scope of our a uthority or this final rule. Comment : Several commenters pr ovided a dditional recommendations related to p atient resources. One commenter recommended requiring payers to include information on how the consumer can contact the payer directly to report a privacy or security breach. One commenter recommended that C MS de velop an easy-to-understand questionnaire for third- party applications to fill out that included i nf ormation about how the app plans to use the data. This questionnaire could be available to patients. One commenter recommende d that educational in formation about tools be available to family members and clinicians and not just the patient. One commenter suggested in cluding educational con tent for specific conditions or patient popul ations, such as for pediatric care. Several commen ters recommended that CMS include a requirement that the educational materials developed for consumers should also include materials for consumers who may be limited English proficient or have low health literacy. A few commenters recommended that educational materials should be developed with special considerations for vulnerable populations. One commenter recommended that consistent information be available across multiple settings to accommodate varying levels of technology literacy. CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 159 Response : We appreciate the commenters' r ecommendations. A s indicated above , we wi ll be providing suggested content for educational materials to assist payers in me eting their educational obligations under this final rule as detailed at 42 CFR 422.1 . We note that thi s would also be available to c aregivers and family m embers a s w e are requiring this m aterial to be posted on the payer's website. Payers can tailor these materials to best mee t the ne eds of th eir patient populations, i ncluding literacy l evels, l anguages spoken, conditions , etc. Regardi ng recommendations to have pa tients contact the payer directly i n the event of a br e ach, that is the patient's p r erogative ; a payer is required by the HIPAA Privacy Rule to have procedures fo r individuals to submit complaints, a nd to provide directions fo r doing so in its N otice o f Privacy P ractices. Ind i viduals may also submit complaints to the OCR and FTC, in the appropriate situations, to address these concerns. Finall y, we re iterate that we do not have the authorit y to regulate apps, so we cannot as k apps to fill out a questionnaire or facilitate s haring that information w ith pa tients. W e do note tha t we a re ma king available a document containing best practices for app developers to follow, with a spec ial emphasis on ways to protect t he privacy and secu ri ty of patient dat a: https://www.cms.gov/Regulations- and-Guidance/Guidance/Interoperability/index. i. Exceptions or Provisions Specific to Certain Programs or Sub-Programs We proposed certain exc eptions or sp ecific additional provisions as part o f the CMS I nteroperabilit y and Patient Acc ess proposed rule (84 FR 7637) for certain QHP issuers on the FFEs. We also proposed specifi cs ab out how MA organizations subject t o the regulations f inalized here would have to include certain i nformation about the Part D benefit if the MA organization also of fered P art D be nefits; t hose aspects of the propos al s are addressed in sec tion III.C.2.c(1) of this final rule. CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 160 Related to QHP issuers, we specifically proposed t wo exc ept ions. F irst, w e proposed that the requirements proposed in 45 CFR 156.221( a) not apply to issuers offering only SADPs on the FFEs. In c ontrast to Q HP is suers of medica l pl ans, is suers of fe ring only SADPs of fe r enrollees access to a unique and specialized form of m edical care. We believed the proposed standards and healt h IT investment woul d be overly burdensome for SADP issuers as related to their current enrollment and premium intake and could result in SADP issuers no longer par ticipating in FFEs, which would not be in the best interes t of enrollees. A dditiona lly, we believed mu ch of the benefit to e n rollees fro m requiring issuers of QHPs to ma ke patient data more easily available through a sta ndard format depends upon deployment of standards- based API technology that conforms to standards proposed by ONC for HHS adoption at 45 CFR 170.215 (84 FR 7589) and a corresponding energetic response by the developer communit y in deve loping innovative, useful, usable, and affordable consu mer- facing applications through which plan enr ollees can conveniently access, us e, and sha re their i nformation as the y cho ose. Based on the proposals to require implementation of standards- based API technology in the Medicare, Medicaid an d CHIP programs, a s well as by QHP issuers on t he FFEs, w e would anticipate s ignificantly e xpanding the imp lementation of standards -based APIs by medical plans. However, we noted that we did not anticipate similar widespread usage with respect to SADPs. Therefore, we believed that the utility of acce ss to i ssue rs' da ta is less applicabl e to dental cove rage, and did not beli eve it would be in the interest of qu alifie d individuals and qualified employers in the states in which an FFE operates to not certify SADPs because they do not provide patient access to their data th rough a standards-based API. We sought comment on whether we should apply this policy to SADP issuers in the future. CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 161 We also proposed to provide an exceptions process through which the FFEs may certify health plans that do not provide patient access through a standards-base d API, but otherwise me et the requirements fo r QHP c ertification. We proposed in 45 CFR 156 .221(h)(1) that if a pl a n applyi ng for QHP ce rtificati on that is to be offe red through an FFE does not provide patient access to their da ta through a standards- based API, t he issuer must i nclude as part of its QHP appl ication a narrative jus tificati on outlining the rea sons why the plan cannot reasonably satisfy t he requirements in proposed 45 CFR 156.221( a), (b), or (c), the impact of non-compliance upon enrollees, t he current or proposed means of providing healt h informati on t o enrollees, and proposed solutions and timeline to achieve AP I compliance. In 45 CFR 156.221(h)(2), we proposed that the FFE may grant an excepti on to the requirement to provide enro llees access to data through standards- based API technology, if the FFE determines that making available such health p lan is in the interest of qualified indi vidua ls and qualified e mployers in a pa rticular FFE st ate. We anticipate d that this exception would be provided in lim ited s itu ations. For example, we would consider providing an exception for small issuers, issuers who are only in the indivi dual or small group ma rket, f inancially v u lnerable i ssuers, or new e ntrants to the F FEs w ho demonstrate that deploying standa rds-based API technology consistent wi th the required interoperability s tandards w ould pos e a s ignificant ba rrier to the issuer's a bility to p rovide c overage t o consumers , a nd not certifying the issuer's QHP or QHPs would result in consumers having few or no plan options in certain areas . We sought comm ent on other circumstances in which the FFE should consider providing an exception. We summarize the public comments we received on QHP exemptions and provide our responses. CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 Comment: Several commenters pr oposa l to exempt SADPs from the requirements to provid e a patient API. T he se commenter s agreed w ith t he justification off ered that de ntal information may not be as useful to patients, as well as the resource burden conc ern for SADPs. A fe w comme nt ers did not support the propos al to exempt SADPs from the patient API proposed requirements, suggesting it may help dentists and their patients make more informed decisions and that dental informati on may help other heal th care providers for patient treatment. Response : We appreciate the commenters support, as well as t he concerns raised. We believe the financial i mpact on SADP i ssuer s m ay r esult i n fewer S ADP s ava ilable in the FFEs. We ma y conside r the application of this pol icy to SADP is suers in fu ture rulemaking. We are finalizing this pol icy a s proposed a nd exempting S ADPs fro m the Patient Access A P I at thi s time . Com ment : A few commenters e xp ressed s upport for the proposal to a llow CMS to re view a QHP i ssuer's justification for an ex ception t o the Patient A ccess API proposal. O ne commenter recommended C MS r equire QHPs that ar e granted an exc ep tion to not ify pot ential en r ollees that they will not be compliant with the requirement to provide enrollees access to data through standards-based API technology. A few commenters did not support or expressed concern with CMS' proposal to grant QHPs an exception process, feari ng an impact to patient care and uneven patient acc ess to he alth data. O ne commenter d id not want plans and ent ities to function solely as data consumers or aggregators. O ne comm enter suggested that exc ept ions should be rare, limited, and for a defined duration. A few commenters recommended CMS establish or work with plans to make clear the evaluation criteria for reviewing exception requests to ensure parity. One commenter CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 163 recommended C MS de fine a standard for expected a lternative A PI implementation timeline. T his commenter also recommended C MS est ablish a t imeline for evaluating exception requests. O ne commenter requested C MS spe cify how justifications will be s ubm itted as well as g uidance in its annual Letter to Issuers in the FFEs to assist providers in understanding the requirements of the exception application process. R esponse : We appreciate the commenters' conc erns and recommendations. Regarding concerns that t his exception would i mpact ca re and access to health d ata, w e believe it i s more important to ensure patients have access to QHPs, and if an excepti on can provide con sumers continue d coverage , the exception is the pre ferable approa ch. We ar e evaluating the additional recommendations provided for future consideration. Further , in order to better cla rify the appl icability of the API-r elated requirements, w e are revising 45 CFR 156.221(h) to expand the exceptions proc ess to en compass a ll requirements in pa rag raphs (a) thr ough (g), ra ther than ( a) t hrough (c) in the proposed rule. This will ensure that QHP issuers on the FFEs that are not able to meet any of the standards wi ll be subject to the exceptions process. Again, we believe that ensuring patients have access to Q H Ps is paramount. We also n ote tha t additional gui dance will be provided to QHP is suers in the future in or d e r to specify h ow issuers w ill demonstrate compliance with these standards. Comment : Several commenters recommended that CMS expand the proposal to provide exemptions to the Patient Access API proposal to other types of plans for similar reasons including implementation burden and potential unintended consequences, such as driving plans out of the market. The types of payers that the commenters recommended be provided exemptions include MA, Medicaid (including MCOs, Medicare-Medicaid Plans, Fully Integrated Dual-Eligible Special Needs Plan, Long-Term Services and Supports), CHIP, public health CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 164 agencies, sm aller Q HPs and small plans, and new and current QHP issuers. A few commenters recommended C MS inc lude \"loc al plans\" in the definition o f \"sma ll issuer.\" One commenter recommended tha t tribes a lso be exempt from thi s pol icy. R esponse : We appreciate the commenters' recommendations, and w e appreci ate the concerns that cer tain p ayers may h ave unique circumstanc es making new requirements potentiall y more challenging. We note that these policies only appl y to Medicare Advant age organizations, Medicai d and CHIP FFS programs, M edicaid managed c are plans, C H IP m anaged care entities, and QHP issuers on th e FFEs. We are onl y finalizing one exemption, the exception not ed below, not identified in the proposed rule , however. We do not beli eve the burden or potential unintended consequences outweigh the immense benefit to patients and the potential for improved he alth ou tcomes these policies can f acilitate. As not ed earlier in th is final rule, w e are mod ifying the scope of the applicability o f the regulations to QHP issuers on an individual marke t FFE. I n c onsidering the application to issuers offering plans through the FF-SHOP s, we be lieve that, like the exception for issuers of SADPs discussed above, t he financial bu rden t o implement the se polici es may r esult i n f ewer issuers offering plans through the FF-SHOP s and could result in small employers and consumers having fewer or no FF -SHOP plan options . Further, we believe that most FF-SHOP issuers likely would qualify f or exclusion via t he exceptions process we are finalizing. We ha ve modified 45 CFR 156.221( h)(2) to re move the reference to \" qualified employers\" a nd paragraph ( i) to include applicability to indi vidual market FFEs . j. Applicability and Timing At 42 CFR 422.119(h) and 45 CFR 156.221(i), we proposed specific provisions regarding applicability and timing for MA organizations and QHP issuers on the FFEs that CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 165 would be subject to the proposal. We did not propose specific regulati on text for 42 CFR 431.60 or 438.242 be cause we intended t o make the regulation text ef fective on the applicable date, as discussed b elow. We noted that w e expected that state Medicaid and C HI P age ncies would be aware of upcoming new regulations and planning for compliance with them when they are a pplicable, even if the new regulation is not yet codified in th e C FR; we s imilarly expected th at suc h age ncies will ensure that their managed c are plans/entities will be prepared f or compliance. Unli ke Medicaid s tate ag encies and managed c are plans and state CHIP age ncies and managed care entities, MA organizations and QHP issuers on t he FFEs generally a re subj ect to r ules r egarding bid and application submissions to CMS in advance of the coverage period; for example, MA organizations must submit bids to CMS by the fir st Monday in June of the year before coverage starts i n order to be aw arded a n MA contract. In an abundance of ca ution a nd to ensure that these requirements for MA organizations and QHP issuers on the FFEs are enforceable and reflected in the bids and applications these entities submit to us in a dvance of when the actual requirements must be met, we proposed to codify the actual compliance and applicability d ates of these requirements. We solicited comment on this approach. For MA organizations, under 42 CFR 422.119(h), we proposed that the requir ements would be applicable beginning January 1, 2020. Under the proposal, the requirements at 42 CFR 422.119 would be applicable for all MA organizations with contracts to offer any MA plan on that date and thereafter. We requested feedback about the proposed timing from the industry. In particular, we solicited information and requested comment from MA organizations about their current capability to implement an API consistent with the proposal and the costs associated with compliance by January 1, 2020, v ersus compliance by a future date. CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 166 For Medicaid FFS at 42 CFR 431.60 , CHIP agencies that operate FFS systems at 42 CFR 457.730, Medicai d managed care pla ns at 42 CFR 438.242( b)(6) (finalized as \u00a7 438.242(b)(5) in this ru le; see s ection VI.), and C HIP ma naged care entities at 42 CFR 457.1233(d)(2) , we propos ed that the API requirements would be applicable beginning Jul y 1, 2020, regardless of whe n the managed care contract started. We noted that given the expected date of publication of the final rule, w e be lieved July 1, 2020, would provide state Medicaid agencies and CHIP agencies that ope rate FFS sys t ems, Medicaid m anaged ca re plans, and C HI P managed care entities sufficient time to impl ement. We s olicited c omment on the proposal and whether additional flexibility would be necessary t o take into account the contr act terms that states use for their Medicaid managed c are p lans. For CH IP, we noted that we are aware that some states do not provide any benefits on a FFS basis, and we did not intend for those states to implement an API outside their managed care plans. Therefore, we proposed in 42 CFR 457.70 0(c) that separate CHIP agencies that provide benefits exclusively through managed car e entities may meet t he requirements of 42 C FR 457.730 by requiring the managed care entities to meet the requirements of 42 CFR 457.1233(d)(2) beginning July 1, 2020. For QHP issuers on the FFEs, we proposed in 45 CFR 156.2 21(i) that these requirements would be applicable for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2020. We sought comment on the timing of these requirements , and on how long is suers, particularl y smaller issuers, anticipate it would take to come into compliance with these requirements. We explained in the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access proposed rule our belief that these proposals would help to create a health care information ecosystem that allows and encourages the health care market to tailor products and services to compete for patients, thereby CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 167 increasing quality, decreasing costs , and helpi ng them live bett er, healthier lives. Additionally, under these proposals, physicians would be able to access information on t heir patient's c urrent pre scriptions and services by reviewing the information wit h the patient on t he patient's personal device or by the patient sharing data with the provider's EHR system, which would save time during appointments and ultimately improve t he quality of care delivered to be neficiaries. Mos t health care professional s and consumers have widespread access to t he i nternet, providing many access points for viewing he al th care da ta over se cure connections. T hese proposed r equirements would significantly improve beneficiaries' experiences by providing a secure mechanism through which they can access their data in a standardized, computable format. We noted that these proposals were designed to empower patients by making sure that they have access to health information about themselves in a usable digital format and can make decisions about how, with whom, and for what uses they will share it. By making claims data readily available and portable to the enrollee, these initiatives supported efforts to move our health car e system away from a FFS payment system that pays for volume and toward a payment system that pays for value and quality by reducing duplication of services, adding efficiency to patient visits to providers; and, facilitating identification of fraud, waste, and abuse. Data interoperability is critical to the success of new payment models and approaches that incentivize high quality, efficient care. All of the health care providers for a patient need to coordinate their care for a value-based system to work, and that requires information to be securely shareable in standardized, computable formats. Moreover, we noted that patients needed to understand and be actively involved in their care under a value-based framework. We committed to supporting requirements that focus on these goals, and we noted we believe that the specific proposals supported these efforts. CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 168 We summarize the public com ments we received on applicability and timing of the Patient Access API and provide our responses. Comment: A few commenters supporte d the proposed timeline for im plementing APIs. One commenter be lieves t hat pa yers have sufficient time t o p repare APIs and recommended that CMS maintain the proposed timeline. One commenter suggested that to address payer concerns CMS coul d reward plans, such as through higher HEDIS scores, who are able to meet the Ja nuary 1, 2020 date. Many com menter s expressed conc ern w ith the propose d implementation timelines. Many com menters believed that payers a nd developers w ill ne ed m ore time to implement the requi rements and encouraged C MS to delay the implementation date. A f ew commenters were concerned that w ithout suff icient t ime and r esources to implement secu rity protocols, pa yers will be unable to meet the proposed requirements . Many commenters beli eved that additional time will a llow health I T ve ndors and payers to de velop, test, and implement t he necessary systems. Seve ral com menters expressed con cern w ith the costs needed to implement the proposals under the proposed timelines. Several commenters recommended an implementation deadline no earlier than 2021, while several other commenters recommended a proposed implementation date of January 1, 2022. One commenter each suggested January 1, 2023 and January 1, 2024, while another recommended 12 months after the publication of the rule. Many commenters recommended a timeline of at least 18 to 24 months after publication of the final r ule. Several commenters recommended aligning the CMS timelines with the ONC timelines, therefore recommending CMS implement policies in this final rule 2 years after the publication of this final rule. A few CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 169 commenters recommended a 36-month ti meline f or al l proposed polic y implementation dates include d in this rulemaking. A fe w commenters did not support proposing a timeline yet . The commenters noted that the standards and the i nfrastructure should be more mature before implementation dates are set. One commenter sugge sted that CMS and ONC convene a planning gr oup to establis h a mor e appropriate t imeline. Several commenters encouraged CMS take a pha sed approach, which some explained as creating a \"glide path\" from \"proof of conc ept\" to m ore advanced us e cas es and a more expansive set of da ta. C ommenters had a few di fferent r ecommendations f or which da ta elements could be included in which phase of the implementation in such a scenario. A few commenters suggested a n appr oach where smaller plans meet f ewer requirements in itially a nd phase-in to full adopti on. One commenter requested that C MS ex empt small i ssue r s from the requirements of the rule. A few commenters recommende d delayi ng any disincentives and/or 2 years a fter implementation. One commenter expressed c on cern th at the di fferent implementation dates for different payers may create confusion, particularly for dual eligible beneficiaries. Response: We appreciate the commenters' concerns and recommendations. We understand that payers need time to be able to develop, test, and implement the APIs being finalized in this rule. We appreciate that it will take time to map and prepare historic data for sharing via the standards-b ased FHIR API. We want to be sure that payers hav e the time and guidance needed to fully and accurately implement the policies being finalized in this rulemaking. We do not agree, however, that it is necessary to convene a planning group to develop a timeline for implementation. The public has had the opportunity to provid e feedback CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 170 on this i ssue as part of this rul emaking. As a re sult, w e are finalizing the i mplementation date of the Patient Access API as January 1, 2021 for all payers impacted by this rulemaking, except for QHP issuers on the FFEs, for which the rule will be applicable beginni ng with plan years begi nning on or after January 1, 2021. We strongly encourage payers t o implement thes e policies as soon as they ar e capable, but t he Patient A ccess API w ill not be required unt i l January 1, 2021. For Medicaid managed care, we remind states that should they determine that obligations in thi s rul e warrant a retroactive adjustment to c a pitation rates, thos e adjustments mu s t be certified by an actuary i n a revised r ate certification and sub mitted t o CMS as a contract amendment, pursuant t o 42 CFR 438.7(c ). We do appr eciate the to eva luate a phased i mplementation approach. As a re sult, yo u will see in s ection IV. of this fin a l rule how we are us ing the P rovider Directory A PI proposa l as a w ay for payers to s how they are making progress tow ard API deve lopment and access. k. Request for Information on Information Sharing Between Payers and Providers through APIs We proposed the implementation of standards-b ased APIs for making accessible data that a third party co uld use to create applications for patients to access data in order to coordinate and better participate in their medical treatment. While in some instances, direct provider to health plan transmission of health information may be more appropriate than sharing data through a standards-b ased API, in other instances a patient may wish to send a provider a copy of their health information via another health care provider's API. In such cases, patients could direct the payer to transmit the health information to an application (for example, an application offered by a health care provider to obtain patient claims and encounter data, as well as lab test results (if applicable)) on a one-off and as-n eeded basis. To the extent a HIPAA covered entity offers CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 171 patients access to t heir r ecords via a standards-based application, another HIPAA covered entity may be able to obtain a n indi vidual's he alth information from the app for treatment, p ayment, o r ce rtain health care operations purposes, without need of an individual's authorizatio n, consistent with t he HIPAA Rules ( see 45 CFR 164.506). Under other laws, providers may nee d to obtain spe cific individual consent to obtai n healt h information related to care provide d by a behavioral health provider, treatment received a t a substance u se disorder t reatment f acility, certain 42 C FR part 2- covered diagnoses or other claims- related inf ormation, or labs that s uggest a p art 2 diagnosis . We explained in the CM S Interoperability and Patient Access proposed rule how we did not intend to expa nd any scope of author ity to access patient data nor to contravene existing requirements re lated to disclosure o f PH I unde r the HIPAA R ules a nd ot her legal standards, but instead specified a new and additional mechanism by whic h to share h e alth inf ormation a s directed by the individual, thr ough the use of API te chnol ogy in compliance wit h all existing federal, s tate, l ocal, and tribal privacy an d secur ity law s. We expl ained how, in the future, we anticipate payers and providers may seek to coordinate care and share information in such a way as to request data on providers' or a payer's patient/insured overlapping population(s) in one transacti on. We sought comm ent for possible consideration in fut ure rulemaking on the feasibility o f providers being able to request a downl oad on a shared patient popul ation using a standards- based A PI. W e thank commenters for their insights a nd are re viewing the comments re ce ived for inclusion in potentia l fut ure rulemaking. In addition to the comments we received about the specific sections of this Patient Access API p roposal, we also received a number of comments that were specific to the types of payers CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 172 impacted by the proposal, generall y. We summarize th ese public comments by payer type and provide our responses. We received these public comments related to Me dicare Advantage. C omment: One commenter suggested CMS require that MA organizations make patient data maintained in connection with the organizations' various individual and small group market plans available for access and exchange through the Patient Access API. Response : We a ppreciate the c ommenter's s ugge stion. However, in light of the limits on CM S's authority over MA organizations, commercial insurance, and group health plans, we are not adopting requirements to appl y as broadly as the com menter suggested. We note that QHP issuers on the individual marke t FFEs a re required unde r this fina l rule to implement the Patient A ccess API, and we encourage other individual markets, as well as s mall gr oup market plans and group health plans to do so, as well. Comment : One commenter r ecommended C MS spe cify the expectations of MA organizations regarding supplemental b en efits in relation to the Patient A ccess API. O ne commenter recommended C MS eva luate w hether the standards propose d for this AP I are appropriat e for the dental car e space. Response : We a ppreciate the c ommenter's r equ est for additional information. We note that MA c laims data, enc ounter da ta, and clinical data related to suppl emental be nefits, including dental services, are subject t o the API r equirement, eve n if issuers only o ff ering SADPs on FFEs are not subject to the requirement. Comment : One commenter requested additional information on whether Medicare Advantage D-SNPs would be required to provide patients an API. CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 173 Response : We a ppreciate the c ommenter's r equ est for additional information. We note D - SN Ps are MA plans offered by MA organizations and therefore subject to the API requirement adopted at 42 CFR 422.119. Comment : One c omment er requested additional information of whether data shared via an A PI would be subject to member communication rules, such as Medicare Communications and Marketing Guidelines. Response : We appreciate the commenter's request for addi tional information. Whether or not data shared via the Patient Access API being finalize d at 42 CFR 422.119(b) fa lls unde r the purview of CMS's communicati on and marketing rules woul d be dependent on factors such as the relationship of the developer a nd the MA plan(s), the cont ent accompanying the API data, and the intended outcome of the application using the API data. MA plans must continue to follow the provisions of 42 CFR part 422 (such as but not CFR 422.118(d), 422.2260 thr ough 422.2268), including in circumstances when their communications and marketing materials inc lude data tha t is re trieved through an A PI. F or example, if a field marketing organization ( FMO) us es API da ta to create a software application that co mpar es the provider networks for the plans the FMO is contracte d to sell, the appli cation would fall unde r the MA marketing a nd communications regul ations and CMS's oversight. Conversely, if a developer uses API data to create an independent appli cation that provides an a lternative means of scheduling provider appointments, the application would fall outside of CMS's purview. We received these public comments related to Medicaid and CHIP. Comment: Several commenters requested additional information on which Medicaid programs would be re quired to implement and maintain a standards-based API. One commenter wanted additional information as to whether all state's Medicaid Management Information CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 174 Systems (MMIS) would be required t o de velop A PIs. T his commenter stated tha t while it seemed clea r that the rule does not require health plans to use Health IT modules to m ake admin istrative data available, t he role of a payer's claims adjudication system (including MMI S) i s unclear. Response : We a ppreciate the c ommenters' request for information. In proposed 42 CFR 431.60 and 457.730, we specifie d that states wo uld have to implement and maintai n an API for FF S Medicaid programs and CHIP; we also proposed in 42 CFR 438.242( b)(6) (finalize d as 42 CFR 438.242(b)(5) in this rule; see section VI.) and 457.1233(d) that states would have to require each MCO, PIHP, and PAHP to compl y with 42 CFR 431.60 ( under Me dicaid managed care contracts) and 457. 730 (under CHIP m anaged care contracts) as if s uch r equirements applied d irectly to the m. W e a re fina lizing these policies as proposed. Sections 431.60 and 457.730 do not require a specific system to be used for the implementation and maintenance of the API, t hus we defer to each st ate and Medicaid managed c are plan to d etermine which of their sys tems would be the most appropriate. Comment : One commenter r equested that C MS cl arify if an ar rangement in w hich a st ate provided beneficiaries access to their FFS dat a by delegating the API functi on to a managed care pl an woul d be sufficient to s atisfy the rule, or if each entit y in the chain is re quired to implement their own systems, portals, and/or API interfaces . This commenter ques tioned if CMS envisioned the creation of a national ne twork t o exchange Medicare/Medicaid records that w ould sat isfy these requirements in a centralized fashion. Response: We appreciate the commenter's request for information. We are, however, somewhat u nclear what the commenter meant b y \"delegating the API function to a managed care plan.\" We believe the commenter may be questioning if a state could utilize a managed care plan CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 175 to imp lement the API required fo r the s tate's F FS be neficiaries in l ie u of the state imp lementing the API require d in 42 CFR 431.60. If so, the pr oposed rule did not anticipate nor prohibit that type of an arrangement . As such, this fi nal rule could permit such an arrangement, but we remind a state contemplating using such an arrangement that it must meet the all of the requirements in this f inal rule, inc luding the timelines a nd scope specified for data a ccessibility in \u00a7 431.60(b). There is no plan for a nati onal network to exchange Medicare/Medicai d records in lieu of the AP Is be ing finalized in t his rul e at this ti me. C omment: One commenter suggested that CMS establish a stakeholder workgroup to identify best practices in da ta-sharing with Medi caid be neficiaries. Response : We appreciate this suggestion and encourage states and Med icaid m anaged care p lans to w ork w ith their stakeholders to identify b est practices fo r data - sharing with Medicaid beneficiaries in their states. Comment : A commenter expressed concern that reimbursing states for modification of their I T systems at an enhanced match rate while reimbursing managed care plans for their system modification s at the state's standard match rate creates an uneven p laying field for Medicaid managed care plans and a disparity of funding. This commenter noted that in states that make extensive use of managed care, the bulk of system modifications needed to carry out and maintain the proposed interoperability capabilitie s for Medicaid enrollees will be b orne by Medicaid managed care plans and requested that CMS revise its proposal to reflect that all costs attributable to design, development, installation, enhancement, or ongoing operation of both state and Medicaid managed care plan systems will receive the appropriate enhanced federal match. Finally, this commenter requested that CMS take a more rigorous approach and update its methodology for review of state MCO capitation rates to ensure that proposed rates include CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 176 reasonable allowanc es for cos ts of I T systems work pe rf ormed b y the state's Medicaid managed ca re plans in furtherance of the proposals in this regulation. R esponse: We appreciate the commenter's concern. However, w e do not agree that the difference in the f ederal match rate creates an un even playing field. Capitation rates must be actuarially sound independent of the federal matching rate that applies to the payment of thos e rates. T he provision of e nhanced f ederal match r ate is addressed i n section 1 903( a)(3)(A) of the Act and provides a 90 percent match rate for \"...the sums expended during such quarter as are attributable to the design, development, or installation of such mechanized claims processing and information retrieval systems as t he Secretary deter mines are like ly to pr ovide mo re e fficient, economi cal, and effective administration of the plan...\" It d oes not spec ifically provide an enhanced m atch r ate for the portion of a c apitation ra te that may be inc luded for information t echnology expenditures , and w e do not have th e authority to extend the enhanced match rate beyond the conditions specified i n statute. We alr eady have a very rigorous capitati on rate re view process and will review any changes noted by the states in those rates, including any specifically noted for IT system enhancements specific to the requirements finalized in this rule. Comment: One commenter requested that the new requirement to implement and maintain an API must be uniform across the system and non-n egotiable to Medicaid managed care plans, state government, and providers. One commenter noted that CMS should address situations where states may choose to adopt additional or conflicting data sharing requirements in Medicaid or CHIP managed car e contracts. This commenter further stated that it is critical that covered health plans be subject to uniform standards for data accessed through an API and that CMS should work with state Medicaid and CHIP programs to ensure that any state mandated requirements for data accessed through an API ar e harmonized with the new federal standards. CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 177 This commenter suggested that submission of the encounters in a timely manner by all involved wi th the new rule must be a non- negotiable condition for the receipt of Medicare or Medicaid re imbursement. In addition, the commenter noted that enforcement cannot be left to plans based on variable contract terms but must be provided by federal agencies. Response : We a gree w i th the commente r that im plementation of standards -based A PIs should be consistent ac ross states and Medicaid a nd CHIP m anaged car e plans and have codified the requirements fo r AP Is in 42 CFR 431.60( b), 4 57.730(b), 438.242(b)(6) (finalized as 438.242(b)(5) in this rule; see section VI.), and 457.1233(d) to ensure an appropriate level of unif ormi ty and consistency w hi le still providing states w ith an adequate le vel of flexibility to go beyond the minimum standards included in this final rule when they believe doing so benefits the ir beneficiaries. While we do not have a specific provisions that conditions payment on the timely receipt of encounters, states and manage d care plans ma y find that a useful pr ovision to include in their contracts. S tates must ha ve a mon itoring s ys tem in e ffect for their Medicaid managed care programs under \u00a7 438. 66(b)(6) , which al so spe cifies \"information systems, including encounter data reporting\" as a require d element. Similarly, we have cer tain program over sight r esponsibilities, suc h as the review of certain Med icai d and C HIP m anaged care contracts and all c apitation rates, and will incorporate ov e rsight of requirements in this fina l rule to the extent appropriate. Comment : One commenter noted that CMS encourages the Medicaid and CHIP FFS programs to use the API as a means to exchange PHI with providers for treatment purposes, suggesting the data would be shared in advance of a patient's visit. But CMS also states that this proposal can empower the patient to decide how their health information is going to be used. CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 178 This c ommenter requested a dditional information of the role CMS i ntends for the patient and the pr ovider t o have in the use of AP Is. Response : While we believe that a beneficiary's use of an A PI to obt ain their he alth car e data will play an important role in their health care, as proposed and finalized, this rule does not set standards for health care provider use of apps to obtain informati on from payers. A s proposed a nd finalized in 42 CFR 431.60(a) and 457.730(a), the API permits third- party applications to retrieve a patient's da ta a t the patient's re que st. A beneficiar y may make the deci sion to obtain their health care data th rough such an app and share it with a provider in advance of a visit or otherwise. Comment : One commenter requested c la rity on whether the p ropos ed ru le requires a ll states' MM IS [Medicaid M anagement Information System] to ma ke in for mation available to patie nts w ithin one (1) business da y of receipt or adjudication of administrative data ( adjudicated claims, enc ounters, r emittance, etc.). T his commenter expr essed concern that these data could appear to conflict with data obtained by a patient directly from a managed care plan, causing confusion and increasing administrative overhead. Response : We appreciate the commenter's request for additional information. Medicaid beneficiaries should not be receiving the information from both the state and managed care plan for the same service. If the beneficiary is receiving a service under the state's Medicaid FFS program, the requirements in \u00a7 431.60 apply; that is, the state is responsible for providing the specified data elements in \u00a7 431.60(b) through the API. If the beneficiary is enrolled in a managed care plan (receiving the service under the managed care plan's contract), the requirements in \u00a7 438.242(b)(5) (proposed as \u00a7 438.242( b)(6); see section VI.) apply; that is, the managed care plan is responsible for providing the specified data elements in \u00a7 431.60(b) CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 179 through the API. The beneficiar y should not rec eive data that is in conflict with other dat a that is made available th rough the API. The same is true for CHIP. If the beneficiary is in CHIP F FS, the requirements in \u00a7 457.730 apply; that is, the state is responsible for providing the specified data elements in \u00a7 457.730(b) thr ough an API. If the beneficiary is enrolled in a managed car e plan, the requirements in \u00a7 457.1233(d) apply; that is, the managed care plan is responsible for providing the specified d a ta elements in \u00a7 457.730(b) through the API. Comment: One commenter expressed concerns regarding the ongoi ng burden for s tate Medicaid an d CHIP age nc ies to monitor the API, privacy and securi ty features, and p otential security risks posed by the numerous applications that may connect to the API. This com menter recommended that states be required to monitor the compliance of each of their m anaged car e plans regarding the API requirements. Response : We understand the commenter's concerns about burden related to the API, as well as the need for states to monitor the API for privacy and security. These requirements are specified at 42 CFR 431.60(c)(1) and (2) and 457.730(c)(1) and (2). While we understand that there is some burden for states and managed care plans related to the development and implementation of the API, we continue to believe that the benefits and potential for improved health outcomes outweigh the burden associated with these requirements. We also confirm for commenters that states are required to monitor compliance for their contracted managed car e plans in regard to the API requirements under 42 CFR 438.242(b)(5) (proposed as 42 CFR 438.242(b)(6); see section VI.) and 457.1233(d). Since these requirements apply to managed care plans, states are required to include the requirements under their managed car e contracts and must ensure that plans comply with the standards specified in 4 2 CFR 431.60 and 457.730 as if those requirements applied directly to the managed care plan. CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 180 Comment : Several co mmenters stated that the Patient Access API proposal places a significant burden on Medicaid and CHIP beneficiaries to monit or the privacy and security of their own health information while it is being accessed by non-H IPAA covered entities. One commenter recommended that CMS consider how educational efforts could be uniquely tailored to specific populations, such as Medicaid beneficiaries, particularly given the need for special considerations when attempting to engage with vulnerable populations. This commenter recommended that CMS amend or revise the current language in its proposed rule to explicitly require that API vendors be responsible for the education of consumers. Another commenter noted that many Medicaid and CHIP beneficiaries are children and that app developers, states, and managed care plans will also need to develop resources for minor access and control over health information and educate members accordingly. Response : We appreciate the commenters' concerns, and we acknowledge that some Medicaid beneficiaries may find negotiating the privacy and security app landscape burdensome. Any patient, including one who is not comfortable with technology, may choose not to use this method of data exchange. However, we would like all beneficiaries to be able to benefit from these apps. One way we are looking to mitigate this burden is through education. We believe that it is important for beneficiaries to have th e educational resources to be able to best evaluate their third-p arty options. States and managed care plans must co mply with the requirements 42 CFR 431.60(f) and 457.730(f) that require states and managed care plans to develop and provide on a public website beneficiary resources regarding privacy and security, including information on how beneficiaries can protect the privacy and security of their health information in non- technical, simple and easy-to-understand language. We note in section III.C.2.h. of this final rule, that CMS will provide suggested content for educational material payers can use to meet this CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 181 requirement. S tates, M edicaid managed care plans, and C HIP m anaged c are entities have vast experience with te chniques for creating effective communications for their be neficiaries and we encourage states and m anaged car e plans to tailor these resources for t heir Medicaid an d CH IP populations. We also agree that st ates and m anaged car e plan s will ne ed t o develop or refine resour ces to address patient access for m i nor populations and for popul ations bas ed on health literac y levels. We do note that we do not have the aut horit y to regulate vendor s. While we agree that A PI ve ndors should have a role in educ ating consumers, states and managed ca re plans are the entities r esponsible f or developing a nd implementing the API; therefore, w e believe it is mor e appropriate for states and managed care plans to develop and provide the educational resources for be neficiaries. Comment : A few commenters r e quested that CMS modi fy the r ule to exe mpt Med icaid managed c are plans. C ommenters noted t hat Me dicai d managed care plans are already operating w ith ra zor thin ma rgins and the proposed rul e w ill substantially inc re ase th e costs for Medicaid ma naged care plans. Further, commenters noted that d ue to the substantial incr ease in costs, plans may not be able to meet the MLR requirements in 42 CFR 438.8. Another commenter s uggeste d that CMS explicitly exclude from the requirements of the rule longterm services and supports (LTSS) plans. Som e commenters al so recommended that C MS exclude dental plans from the requirements in the proposed ru le. Response : We appreciate the commenters' concerns, however we are not exempting Medicaid or CHIP managed care plans, including LTSS or dental plans, from the requirements in this rule, as such an approach would not be consistent with our goal of ensuring that all beneficiaries across the health care market, including Medicaid FFS and managed care, have access to and can exchange specified health care data. We are finalizing the Patient Access API CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 182 requirements for state M edicaid and CHIP ag encies and managed car e plans, including L TSS and dental p l ans. S tates and managed car e plans must m ake adjudicated c laims and encounter data a vailable thr ough the A PI for all Medicaid-covered services, including LTSS and dental. This requirement extends to al l Med icaid -covered ser vices for w hich a claim, o r encounter c l aim, is generated and adjudicated. Regar ding costs for managed c are plans - since the Patient A ccess API requirements must be contractual obl iga tions under t he managed c are contract - the state must i nclude the se costs i n the development of a plan's capitation rates. Final Action: After consideration of the c omments received, and for the reasons outlined in our response to t hese comm ents and in the CMS I nter operability and P atient A ccess proposed rule, w e a re finalizing with modi fications our proposal to require M A organizations, M edicaid and CHIP F F S programs, Med ica id managed c are plans, C H IP m anaged c are entities, and QHP issuers on the F FEs to i mplement and maintain a standards -ba sed P atient A ccess API t hat m eets the technical standards as finalized by HHS in the ONC 21st Century Cures Act final rule (published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register) at 45 CFR 170.215, content and vocabulary standards adopted at 45 CFR part 162 and 42 CFR 423.160, and finalized by HHS at 45 CFR 170.213 (USCDI version 1), unless alternate standards are required by other applicable law; i ncludes the data elements specified in this final rule, and permits third-party applications to retrieve, with the approval and at the direction of the enrollee, data specified at 42 CFR 422.119, 431.60, 457.730, and 45 CFR 156.221. Specifically, we are finalizing that the Patient Access API must, at a minimum, make available adjudicated claims; encounters with capitated providers; provider remittances; enrollee cost-sharing; and clinical data, including laboratory results (where maintained by the impacted payer). Data must be made available n o later than one (1) business day after a claim is adjudicated or encounter data are received by the impacted CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 183 payer. W e are not finalizing a requirement for the P atient Access A P I to ma ke provider directory and pha rm acy directory information avail able. I nstea d, t o limit burden, we are only requiring provider and, in the case of MA-PD plans, pharmacy director y informati on be include d i n the Provi der Directory A PI discussed in section IV. of this f inal rule. We ar e finalizi ng the proposed documentati on r equirements noting business and te chnical documentation necessary to interact with the API must be made freely and publicly accessible. We note that the APIs need to comply with all existing federal and st ate privac y and security law s. We a re fina lizing, cons istent wi th t he HIPAA R ules that a payer may de ny acces s to t he P atient A ccess API i f the payer r easonably d etermine s that allowing a specific third -party appl ication to connect or rem ain connecte d to the API woul d present an unacceptable level of risk to the security of PHI on t he payer's systems ba sed on ob jective and verifiable criteria. We are also f inalizing that p ayers need t o make available to enrollees resources explaining factors to consider in selecting an app for their healt h information, pr ac tical strategies to s afeguard the ir pri vacy and s ecurity, and how to submit complaints to OCR or FTC. We do note that we are providing p ayers with su ggested con tent the y can use and tailor t o meet this requirement, available here: https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and- Gui dance/Guidance/Interoperability/index. We also n ote that impacted pa yers are allowed to request that third -party apps attest to havi ng certain information include d i n their privacy policy, and inform pa tients about this attestation, to he lp ens ure patients are aware of th e privacy r isks associated with their choices. We are finalizing this policy with the following technical corrections and additional information. At 42 CFR 422.119(a) and (b)(1); and, 45 CFR 156.221(a) and (b) we specify these policies apply to current patients and CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 184 their personal representatives. and, 45 CFR 156.221(b)(1)(i) and (ii) we are removing the word \"standardized\" to avoid confusion as the standards are specified elsewhere. We are finalizing the regulation text at 42 CFR 422.119(b)(1)(iv), 431.60(b)(4), and 457.730(b)(4), with the verb \"maintains\" in place of the verb \"manages\" in order to more closely align with the relevant HIPAA Privacy Rule requirement. We are finalizing a technical correction at 42 CFR 431.60(b)(2) and 42 CFR 457.730(b)(2) to replace \"within one (1) business day\" with \"no later than 1 business day after\" to be consistent across payers. We have added text to specifically indicate that the technical requirements at 42 CFR 422.119(c), 431.60(c), and 457.730(c), and 45 CFR 156.221(c) apply to the API under paragraph (a) of the respective sections. We are finalizing at 42 CFR 422.119(c)(2), 431.60(c)(2), 457.730(c)(2), and 45 CFR 156.221(c)(2), to include additional text to explicitly require, as described in the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access proposed rule (84 FR 7635) the requirement to also update (as appropriate) the API to ensure it functions properly and includes assessments to verify an individual enrollee or their personal representative can only access claims and encounter data or other PHI that belongs to that enrollee. In addition, we are removing the word \"minimally\" from this regulation text in order to ensure it is clear that privacy and security features must be reasonable and appropriate, consistent with the requirements of HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules, 42 CFR parts 2 and 3, and other applicable law protecting privacy and security of individually identifiable health information. We are making a technical change for readability only at 42 CFR CFR 156.221(c)(3) and (4)(ii)(C). In addition, we have refined the language at 42 CFR 422.119(g), 431.60(f), and 185 CFR 156.221(g) to state the payer must make education materials available \"in an easily accessible location on its public website,\" and at 42 CFR 422.119(g)(1), 431.60(f)(1), and 457.730(f)(1), and 45 CFR 156.221(g)(1) to include a reference to uses of 42 CFR 422.119(d), 431.60(d), 457.730(d), and 45 CFR 156.221(d), we are finalizing additional text to specify that \"publicly accessible\" means that any person using commonly available technology to browse the in ternet could access the information without any preconditions or additional steps, such as a fee for access to the documentation; a requirement to receive a copy of the material via email; a requirement to register or create an account to r eceive the docum entation; or a requirement to read promotional material or agree to receive future communications from the organization making the documentation available. In the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access proposed rule, the criteria and process for assessing unacceptable risk to a payers system was explained as part of the payer's responsibilities under the HIPAA Security Rule well as 45 CFR 156.221(e)(1) we are finalizing additional text to note that payers should determine risk consistent with its security risk analysis under 45 CFR part 164 subpart C to indicate the specific section of the HIPAA Security Rule implicated here. We are modifying 45 CFR 156.221(h)(2) to remove the reference to \"qualified employers\" and CFR 156.221(i) to include applicability to \"individual market\" FFEs to exclude issuers offering plans through the FF-S HOPs. Fi nally, we are finalizing for MA organizations at 42 CFR 422.119(h), Medicaid FFS programs at 42 CFR 431.60(g), Medicaid managed care plans at 42 CFR 438.62(b)(1)(vii), CHIP FFS programs at 42 CFR 457.730(g), CHIP managed care entities at 42 CFR 457.1233(d), that beginning January 1, 2021, and for QHP issuers on the FFEs at 45 CFR 156.221(i) beginning with plan years beginning on 186 CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 or after January 1, 2021, these payers m ust m ake available through the Patient Access API da t a they maintain with a date of service on or after January 1, 2016, consistent with the payer -to- payer data exchange requirement discussed in section V. of this final rule. IV. API Access to P ublished P rovider Directory D ata P rovisions, an d Analysis of and Resp onses to P ublic Comments A. Interoperability Background and Use Cases In section III. of the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access proposed rule (84 FR 7626 through 7639), we focused on patient access to their own data through a standardized, transparent API - t he Patient Access API. As part of this proposal, we discussed and sought comment on requiring payers at 42 CFR 422.119(b)(1)(iii) and (b)(2)(ii) for MA organizations, 42 CFR 431.60(b)(3) for Medicaid FFS programs, 42 CFR 438.242(b)(6)(ii) for Medicaid managed care plans, 42 CFR 457.730(b)(3) for CHIP FFS programs, and 42 CFR 457.1233(d)(2)(ii) for CHIP managed care entities to provide their provider directory information through that same Patient Access API. In addition, the proposed rule sought comment on making the provider directory information available through a public-f acing standards-based API. As we discussed in the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access proposed rule (84 FR 7639), making provider directory information available through a public-facing API raised different issues than API access proposals related to patient data. Based on our consideration of public comments summarized and responded to below, and in an effort to avoid duplicative effort and additional burden resulting from having the provider directory information included in both the Patient Access API and the Provider Directory API, we are finalizing the requirement for a public-facing Provider Directory API at 42 CFR 422.120 for MA organizations, 42 CFR 431.70 for Medicaid 42 CFR 438.242(b)(6) for Medi caid CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 187 managed care plans, 42 CFR 457.76 0 for CHIP FFS programs, and 42 CFR 457.12 33(d)(3) for CHIP ma naged c are entities, bu t we will not finalize ou r propos al to also provide access to th is provi der directory information through the Patient Access API at 422.119, 42 C FR 431.60, 42 respectively. Provider d irectori es make key information abou t health care professional s and organiz ations available to help consumers identify a provider when they enroll in an insurance plan or as new health needs arise. For example, such information might include hours of operation, languages spoken, specialty/services , and availability for new patie nts. Provider directories also functi on as a resource used by the provider community to discover contact informati on of other provide rs to facilitate re ferrals, t ransitions of care, a nd care c oordination for enrollees. As discussed in the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access proposed rule, the current applicable regulations for MA plans (42 CFR 422.111) and Medicaid and CHIP managed care plans (42 CFR 438.10(e)(2)(vi) and (h) and 457.1207, respectively) already require that provider directories be made available to enrollees and potential enrollees in hard copy and on the plan's website. Section 1902(a)(83) of the Act requires state Medicaid agencies to publish a directory of certain physicians on the public website of the State agency. A regulation for QHP issuers (45 CFR 156.230(b)) requires public access to the QHP's provider directory in addition to distribution and access for enrollees. In addition to mandating that this information be accessible, the current regulations also address the content of such directories and the format and manner in which MA plans, Medicaid managed care plans, CHIP managed care entities, and QHP issuers on the FFEs must make the information available. CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 188 Making this required provider d irectory information available to enrollees and prospective enrollees through an API could support developme nt of third-p arty software applications, or apps, (whether standalone or integrated with providers' EHR technology) that would pull in current information about available providers to meet enrollees' current needs. Broad availability of provider d irectory data through interoperable API technology would also allow for innovation in applications or other services that help enrollees and prospective e nrollees to more easily compare provider n etworks while they are considering their o ptions fo r changing health plans. Finally, w e noted in our proposal that a consistent, FHIR-b ased API-driven approach to making provider directory data accessible could reduce provider burden by enabling payers to more widely share basic information about the providers in their networks, such as provider type, specialty, contact information, and whether or not they are accepting new patients. B. Broad API Access t o Provider Directory Data In sections III.C. and IV. of the C MS Interoperability and Patient Access p roposed rule (84 FR 7633, 7639 through 7642), we proposed to require at 42 CFR 422.119(b)(1)(iii) for MA organizations, 42 CFR 431.60(b)(3) for Medicaid FFS programs, 42 CFR 438.242(b)(6)(ii) for Medicaid managed care plans, 42 CFR 457.730(b)(3) for CHIP FFS programs, and 42 CFR 457.1233(d)(2)(ii) for CHIP managed care entities that payers subject to the proposed rule make standardized information about their provider networks available through API technology, so that the public, including third-party app developers and patients, could access a nd use that information, including republishing the information o r information derived from that information in a user-friendly way. As discussed in the preamble of the CMS In teroperability and Patient Access p roposed rule, w e sought comment o n making provider d irectory information more CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 189 generally available (84 FR 7639 through 7642). We discussed requiring that the API technology conform to the API standards proposed by ONC for HHS adoption at 45 CFR 170.215 (84 FR 7589). Currently, becaus e QHP issuers on the FFEs are already required to make provider directory information available in a specified, machine -readable format 42, we did not propose that QHP issuers would have to make provider directory information available through an API. Howev er, we requested information regarding whether this same requirement should apply to QHP issuers, or if such a requirement would be overly burdensome for them. We thank commenters for their insights on this request for information and are reviewing the comments received for inclusion in potential future rulemaking. We note d in the preamble of the proposed rule that, since this provider directory information is already available and accessible to enrollees without cost to them under existing law, this infor mation should be as accessible through the API as it is required to be when posted on the organization's websites. Therefore, we proposed that the tec hnical standards proposed (now finalized) by HHS in the ONC 21st Century Cures Act final rule (published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register ) at 45 CFR 170.215 (specifically at paragraphs (a)(3) and (b)) that are specific to authenticating users and confirming individuals' authorization or request to disclose their personal information to a specific application through an API, namely the SMART IG (using the OAuth 2.0 standard) and OpenID Connect Core 1.0, should not apply to our proposed public access to provider directory information through APIs (84 FR 7639). We noted that while we were aware the organization will nevertheless need to take appropriate steps to mitigate the potential security risks of allowing any application to connect to the API through which it offers provider directory access, we emphasized that these steps should be appropriate 42 Available at http://cmsgov.github.io/QHP-p rovider-f ormulary-A PIs/developer/index.html. CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 190 to the level of risk associated with the specific use case of accessing otherwise public information through API technology. We also noted that those wishing to access these data should not be unduly burdened by security protocols that are not necessary to provide the appropriate degree of protection for the organization's systems and data. As referenced in sections II. and III. of the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access proposed rule (84 FR 7618 through 7639), we intended to develop additional guidance, incorporating fe edback from industry tha t provides imp lementation best practices relevant to FHI R-conformant standards -based APIs to he lp organizations subject to the requirements pr oposed i n this rulemaking. To that end, we sol icited comme nt on w hat spe cific resources woul d be most helpful to organizations implementing APIs under requirements proposed in the proposed rule. We summarize all publ ic comments w e received on making provi der d irectory information available through an A P I - in term s of requiri ng a dedicated, publicly accessible P rovider Directory A PI and more generally s haring pr ovider directory information via an A PI, inc luding as proposed under the Patient Access API discussed in section III. of this final rule and provide our responses. Comment: Many commenters supported a requirement for MA organizations, s tate Medicaid and CHIP FFS programs, Medicaid managed care plans, an d CHIP managed care entities to make standardized information about their pro vider networks available through API technology to current enrollees, prospective enrollees, and possibly the general public. Commenters stated that they believe accurate p rovider directory data will improve transparency and accessibility of information regarding a provider's network status, which will help with CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 191 efforts to address s urprise bi lling and other coverage issues re lated to whether providers a re in or out-of-network. Response: We thank commenters for their support. Appreciating that provider information is already publicly available, and unlike the other information included in the Patient Access API discussed in section III. of this final rule, is of a less sensitive nature, to avoid potential confusion and reduce burden resulting from having the provider directory information included in both the Patient Access API and the Provider Directory API, we are only requiring that one API - the Provider Directory API - provide access to provider directory information. As a result, we are finalizing additional regulation text to requir e the Provider Directory API at 42 CFR 422.120 f or MA organizations; at 42 CFR Medicaid state agencies; at 42 CFR for managed care plans; at 42 CFR for CHIP state agencies; and at 42 CFR 457.1233(d)(3) for CHIP managed care entities. This Provider Directory API must include the same information about the provider directory as originally proposed for the Patient Access API. Specifically, the Provider Directory API must include provider directory data on a payer's network of contracted providers, including names, addresses, phone numbers, and specialties, updated no later than 30 calendar days after a payer receives provider directory information or updates to provider directory information. We are finalizing the applicable regulation text with the phrase \"complete and accurate\" to emphasize our intent that the directory data meet this standard. Fo r MA organizations that offer MA-P D plans, the Provider Directory API must also make available pharmacy directory data, we are specifying that the plans must make available, at a minimum, pharmacy name, address, phone number, number of pharmacies in the network, and mix (specifically the type of pharmacy, such as \"retail pharmacy\"). As with the provider directory information, we are finalizing that pharmacy directory information must be updated no CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 192 later than 30 calendar days after the MA organization that offers the MA -PD plan receives pharmacy directory information or updates to pharmacy directory information. Comment: Some commenters disagreed w it h the proposal. T hey st ated t ha t pa yers are already require d to make this in formation available and this proposal could result in unnecessary duplicati on of effort and addi tional costs. One commenter suggested CMS provide an exemption for payers th at are a lready pr oviding this in formation in a ma nner that aligns with the re quirements in the proposed rule. Response: We appreciate the commenters' conc er n about potentially dup licative effort. While w e understand tha t different payers a re already required to ma ke th is inf ormation a vailable in a ma chine readable format or on a pu blic w ebsite according to the different rules associ ated w ith ea ch program, w e bel ie ve that making this in formation a vailable th rough a standardized API will bring additional benefits t o enrollees and prospective enr ollees by making it easier for developers t o incorporate thi s information into c onsumer -facing applications. We note that we did not propose to extend the requirement regarding provider directory information to QHP issuers on the FFEs, as these issuers are al ready required to make provider di rectory information available a ccording to a specific s tandard for the electronic transfer of this information, as discussed in the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access proposed rule (84 FR 7633). Comment: Many commenter s raised concerns about the accuracy of provider directory information that would be available through the API, and ho w these inaccuracies can have a negative impact on consumers. One commenter stated that there is a high prevalence of inaccurate provider directories issued by MA organizations, in particular, and for other public and private payers, generally, and that this can bring into question the adequacy and validity of a CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 193 network. Another noted that inaccurate provider directories have also resulted in patients receiving surprise bills as a result of seeing an ou t-of-network phys i cian. Commenters expre ssed ki ng provider directory inf ormation more accessible th rough an API could exacerbate the impact of inaccuracies resulti ng in conflicting and conf using information for consumers, f or instance, where an enrollee participates in two plans and recei ves di fferent information about the same provider fr om each. Commenters discusse d a variety of ste ps that CMS should take in concert with the proposa l to ensure th at provider directory information ma de available th ro ugh the API is te sted to ensure it is current, correct, and accurate. One commenter suggested C MS r equir e payers to provide API vendors with accurate provider director y information. Respons e: We appreciate commenters' con cerns and thank the commenters for their sugge stions. We have taken a number of steps to improve the a ccuracy of provider directory informati on for plans su bject to direct regulation by CMS, such as implementing a process to audit directory inf ormation with M A organizations to ide ntify de ficiencies in a n effort to i ncrease data accuracy ( for more in formation see https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Health - Plans/ManagedCareMarketing/Downloads/Provider_Directory_Review_Industry_Report_Round _3_11-28-2018.pdf). We will take the suggestions provide d into consideration as we c ontinue this effort. We encourage al l enrollees to check with a new provider about network participation to avoid surprises and continue to explore ways to work with the payers that we directly regulate (like M A organizations) to imp rove the accuracy of directories. We are finalizing regulation text on the Provider Directory API at 42 CFR 422.120(b), 431.70(b), 438.242(b)(6), 457.760(b), and 457.1233(d)(3) to require that accurate and complete provider directory information be made available through the API. We believe that this language CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 194 will clarify our expectation that payers take steps to ensure provider directory information made available thr ough the API accurately reflects the current providers within the payer's network. Commenter: Several commenters responded to our proposal that impacted payers update provider directory information made available through the API to current and prospective enrollees within 30 days of receiving an update to their directory information. The commenters suggested that CMS should decrease the amount of time allowed for updates; for instance, one commenter suggested that CMS should require that provider directory information is updated within 48 hours of a change, while another recommended directory updates occur in real time, or on a regular basis as frequently as possible. Some commenters who supported the requirement that provider directories be publicly available through API technology specifically expressed concerns with how frequently directories must be updated in the case of Medicaid and CHIP programs. One commenter recommended that the clock for the 30-day requirement begins from the date the state provides the information to the Medicaid or CHIP managed care plan. Another commenter recommended that entities should be required to update provider directories in real-time. Response: We appreciate commenters' suggestions, and agree that more frequent updates of the provider directory information made available through the API could help to increase the accuracy of this information. Our proposed 30-day time frame was not intended to preclude payers from updating the information available via the API on a shorter timeframe, or from making updates in real time. However, we understand that payers may have different operational processes for making updates to their provider directories and are seeking to set a minimum floor for how frequently information available through the API must be updated. This is consistent with timeframes for other updates some of these payers are required to make. For instance, CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 195 Medicaid managed care plans must update pa per pr ovider directories monthly a nd electronic provider directories no later than 30 days aft er the plan receives the upda ted information under \u00a7 438.10(h)(3). The Provider Directory A PI regulations finalized he re r equire tha t state Medicaid a nd CHIP age ncies, and managed car e plans, m ake available through the API provider d irectory information no later t ha n 30 calendar da ys after the state or managed c are plan r eceives the provider directory information or updates to the provider directory information. We confirm tha t the state or managed care plan must make the provider directory information available through the API within 30 c alendar days of receiving the information. This ti meframe for ma naged c are pl ans is consistent with the requirement in \u00a7 438. 10(h)(3) for Medicaid managed care plans, which appl ies to C HIP m anaged c are entities under \u00a7 457.1207. We decline to require updat es to provider d irectori es i n r eal-time as we do not bel ieve that su ch a timeframe is operationally f easibl e for MA organizations, st ates or Med icaid and CHIP m anaged car e plans at this time. We a re finalizing our proposal that MA or ganizations, state Medicaid and C HIP F FS programs, Med icaid m anaged c are plans, an d CHIP m ana ged car e entities upd ate pr ovider directory information made a vailable through this API within 30 days of re ceiving a change as proposed. Comment: Several commenters be lie ve that, in order to increase th e accuracy of provider directory data, CMS should take steps to hold providers responsible for the accuracy of their provider director y information. One commenter suggested CMS require healt h care providers to upda te their information with a c entralized e nt ity, for instance a trus ted h ealth information exchange, rather than looking to impacted payers to include these mandates in their contracts with providers. Another suggested that CMS should require providers to submit rosters to CMS CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 196 each mont h indicating which healt h plans they contract wi th, enabling CMS to validate informati on provide d through the propos ed API. Another commenter suggested CMS ensure that CMS-regulated payers are provide d with updated provider informati on in a timely m anner by ma king such reporting requirements a conditi on of participation in Medicare. R esponse: We appreciate commenters' sugg estions, and agr ee that providers have an important role to p lay in ensuring that provider d irectory information about them, provided to, and used by the payers with whic h they contract or part icipate, is up-to-date. While we did not include any proposals in this rulemaki ng spec ificall y focused on provider res ponsibilit y for updating the informat ion to be ma de available through the proposed API, we will continue to work with federal and industry partners to identify opportunities to improve the acc uracy of provider directory information acro ss the he alth c a re system. Com ment: Several com mente rs noted t hat a centralized repository that c an ser ve as a \"source of truth\" for provider directory information is needed to ensure accuracy, a nd urged CM S to support work across stakeholders for such an approach. One commenter noted that health informati on excha nges (HIEs) could hel p payers to update th eir information through access to the directories that H IEs use f or clinical da ta exchange. Response: We t hank commenters for their input. Our policy is focused around payers ma king provider directory inf ormatio n available through APIs to provide greater access to specific information on the providers in their networks. However, we believe entities focused on aggregati ng provider director y information can serve an important role , and we encourage payers to work wi th partners that maintain this information to improv e accuracy. Comment: Several commenters suggested additional information for inclusion as part of the provider directory information made available through the API for current and prospective CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 197 enrollees ( in addition t o provider names, addresses, phone num bers, a nd specialties), such as NP Is for individual and group providers, practice group nam e, health system name, as well as the specific plan(s) and tiers a provider p articipates in. One commenter al so suggested including minimum provider demographics to be included in the clinical and administrative transactions to ens ure a ccurate pr ovide r matching; whethe r the provide r is accepting new patients ; information about whi ch providers are in-network for a plan by geography and/or specialt y regardless of whe ther the individual is a me mber of a pa rticular pl a n or is researching pl an options; and which clinicians are in-network for care coordination and plan switching purposes. Response: We appreciate commenters' suggestions and agree that this additional information may be helpful to c onsumers. H owe ver, a t this time w e are seeking to minimize the burde n for the regulated payers that must comply with this proposal, and have sought to identify a min imum set of provider directory information that aligns with existing r equirements appl icable to MA organizations (including MA organizations that offer MA- PD plans), st ate Medicaid an d CHIP F F S programs, Medicaid m anage d care plans, and C HIP m anaged care e ntities re gardi ng such directories . We do encourage payers to explore how they ca n make addi tional provider directory da ta available th rough the API to most benefit c urrent and prospective enrollees. A lso, we not e that the requirements in this fin al rule s et out the mini mum re quirements; payers are strongl y encourage d to go beyond that mini mum, if and as possible , to make useful information available for their enrollees and beneficiaries. Comment: One commenter who supported our proposal also urged CMS to take additional steps to make provider directories more accessible to enrollees, for instance by integrating a provider directory in future iterations of Plan Finder for MA plans, and ensuring the directory data is accurate and up to date. CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 198 Response: We thank the commenter for the suggestions. We will take these suggestions into consideration. Comment: Several commenters addressed issues with technical standards for provider directory information, with several stating that appropriate standards for making this information available through an API are still emerging. For instance, one commenter noted that current provider directory standards were written for FHIR Release 3 and that the standard has not been adopted by the field. The commenter stated that before CMS requires payers to make provider directory information available via a standards-based API, more work is needed to build the provider directory specification in FHIR Release 4. Several commenters suggested that CMS should delay implementing this proposal, proposed to be applicable starting January 1, 2020, until stakeholders have been able to establish consensus-b ased standards for the creation and display of directory information. One commenter encouraged CMS to develop a voluntary, multi-s takeholder partnership to establish data content FHIR-b ased standards related to provider directories and then wait to establish the timeframe for provider directory data updates until the d evelopment of these FHIR-b ased standards are completed. Response: We appreciate commenters' concerns, and agree that updated FHIR-b ased provider directory implementation guidance is important for implementation of this policy. We confirm here that HL7 FHIR Release 4.0.1 - the API standard adopted at 45 CFR 170.215 and which must be used under our Provider Directory API requirement - p rovides a base standard for moving information through an API. The basic information (name, phone number, address, and specialty) required for this Provider Directory API can all be represented through FHIR Release 4.0.1. Additional implementation guidance will provide additional information for how to use the CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 199 FHIR Release 4.0.1 make provider dir ector y informati on available and ensure gr eater uniformity in implementation a nd reduce impl ementation burden for payers. A s noted in s ection III. of this final rule, we have been working with HL7 and partners to ensure the necessary co nsensus -based st andards and assoc iated gui danc e are available so that impacted payers c an consistently i mplement all of the requirements included in this fina l rule. W e are pr ovidi ng a link to a specific FHIR Release 4.0.1 implementation guide and r eference implementation for all interested pa yers fo r the Provider Directory A PI that provide valuable guidance to further support s har ing the needed data usi ng the required standards: https://www.cms.gov/Regulations- and-Guidance/Guidance/Interoperability/index. Though not mandatory, usi ng this gu idance will lower payer burden and support consistent implementation of the FHIR Release 4.0.1 APIs. Appreciating the time needed for payers to build, implement, and test these APIs, we are providing additional time for implementation, and are finalizing January 1, 2021 as the implementation date for the Provider Directory API for all payers subject to this requirement. Appreciating the value of making this information publicly accessible, we do encourage payers to implement this Provider Directory API as soon as they are able. We are requiring at 42 CFR 422.120 for MA organizations, at 42 CFR 431.70 for Medicaid state agencies, at 42 CFR 438.242(b)(6) for Medicaid managed care plans, at 42 CFR 457.760 for CHIP state agencies, and at 42 CFR 457.1233(d)(3 ) for CHIP managed care entities that these payers make the Provider Directory API accessible via a public-facing digital endpoint on their website. We will check a random sample of payer websites for links to these publicly accessible APIs, starting in January 2021 to evaluate compliance. CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 200 Comment: One commenter sugge sted t ha t, as CMS al ready requires provider d irectory informati on to be made ava ilable online by payers subject to this rule, for interoperability transactions CMS shoul d require us e of a standard de scribed as \"the HIPAA 274 transaction.\" The commenter stated t ha t the metadata de fined within th is transaction can dr ive a consistent pa yload for an API to support provider director y informati on sharing. Respons e: We appreciate t he commenter's sugg estion, bu t at this time w e are fina lizing requirements for provider directory informati on to be available thr ough an API using the standards at 45 CFR 170.215, including, FHIR Release 4.0.1 standards finalized by HHS in the ONC 21st Century Cures Act final rule (published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register) to consistently align all various API formats throughout the rule with a single modern standard capable of meeting all requirements. CMS understands that some information within the X12 274 T ransaction (Healthcare Provider Information Transaction Set for use within the context of an Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) environment) may provide the basic provider information to support an API. HHS, however, has not adopted the X12 274 transaction standard under HIPAA or for any other use. Moreover, the required availability of a plan's entire provider directory via an API is not a HIPAA transaction that has been defined or associated with a specific tran saction under HIPAA. We believe that using FHIR Release 4.0.1 for the purpose of this Provider Directory API will provide greater long term flexibility fo r payers subject to this rule, allowing them the ability to meet minimum requirements, and extend beyond these requirements based on the industry's diverse and evolving needs surrounding provider directories, while reducing impact on those who may not be ready to receive additional information beyond the minimum set of data required by this final rule. CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 201 Comment: One commenter requested that CMS ensure public health agencies are also able to access provider directory information made available through the API, while another commenter requested that approved agents and brokers be granted access to this information. Response: Under this f inal rule, the Provider Directory A P I must be publ icly a c cessible, so that any third party can access an impacted payer's provider directory informati on. Our regulation text reflects th is by requiring tha t the Provider Directory A P I be a ccessible via a public-facing digital endpoint on the applicable payer's website. The value of making this infor mation available v ia an API is th a t third -party de velopers w ill be able to a ccess i t to make it avai lable in valuable and useful ways for all in terested s takeholders. W e therefore anticipate that public health agencies , agents, a nd brokers, and any othe r member of the public would be able to access these dat a via third-party apps. C omment: Several com mente rs suggested C MS r equire payers to include othe r types of non-physician pr ofessionals w ithin t heir provider directories, s uch as nur se pr a ctitioners, certified re gistered nur se anesthetists, phys ical therapists, a nd post- acute care providers. Commenters stated that including additional qualified licensed non-physician providers could help increase patient access to care. Response: We appreciate commenters' suggestions. We did not propose to change the parameters of the information required to be inclu ded in provider directories for the payers subject to the Provider Directory API requirement h ere. Existing requirements for paper and on- line provider directories, such as those in 42 CFR 422.111 and 438.10(h), are not changed or limited by this final rule. Instead, our API proposals and this final rule focus on making certain payers (that is, MA organizations, state Medicaid and CHIP FFS programs, Medicaid managed CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 202 care plans, and CHIP managed care entities) share provider directory information through an API. How \"provider\" is defined in this context is outside the scope of this regulation. Comment: One commenter re commended that CMS amend the API requirement to also include FHIR endpoint informati on for providers as par t of provider directory information, to ensure access to r egional/national d ir ectories in addition to the c urrent partial ones. R esponse: We a gree with commenters that FHIR endpoint informati on is important to i interoperabilit across providers. We di scuss FHIR endpoints in secti on IX. of this fi nal rule. For this Provider Directory API, we have focused on a minimum set of information of primary interest to patients and typicall y found in provide r directories. However, we encourage payers to conside r including other data e lements tha t may a dd va lue to the P rovider Directory AP I. We may consider expanding this minimum set of information in potential future rulemaking. Comment: One commenter sugge sted that CMS impose penalties on plans that do not comply with the provider directory requirement. Response: We thank the commenter for this suggestion. We did not propose to establish additional penalties for noncompliance with the requirement to make provider directory information available through an API; however, we note that the requirement to make provider directory information available through an API will be a requirement for MA organizations, Medicaid managed care plans and CHIP managed care entities to fulfill under their contracts in their r espective programs. Therefore, existing enforcement authority for ensuring compliance with those contracts will apply. Further, the API requirements, including the provider directory components of the required API(s) will be req uired for state Medicaid and CHIP agencies operating FFS Medicaid programs and CHIPs. . CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 203 Final Action: A fter co nsider ation of the comments received, and for the reasons outlined in our response to these comments and in the CMS Interoperabilit y and Patient Access propos ed rule, we are finalizing regulations to require that MA orga nizations, Medicaid and CHIP FFS programs, Medicaid m anaged ca re plans, and C HIP m anaged car e entities make standardized information about their provider networks available vi a a FHIR-based A PI conformant with th e s tandards fi nalized by H HS in the ONC 21s t Century C ures Act final rule (published elsewhere in this is sue of the Federal Registe r) at 45 CFR 170.215 (including FHIR Release 4.0.1), excludi ng the security protocols related to user authenticati on a nd authorization a nd any other prot ocols th at restric t the a vailability of this information t o anyone wishing to access it . At a minimum , these pa yers must make available vi a the Provider D irectory A PI pr ovi der names, addresses, phone numbers, and specialties. F or MA organizations that offer MA -PD plans, we are specifying that they mu st make available, a t a mini mum, pharmacy di rec tory d ata, inc luding t he pharmacy name, address, phone number, number of ph armacies in the network, and mix (s pecifically the type of pharmacy, such as \"retail pharmacy\"), updating the regulation text from the proposed rule, which simpl y stated \" number, m i x, and ad dresses of n etwork pha r macies\". All director y information must be available through the API within 30 calendar days of a payer receiving th e directory information or an upda te to the directory in fo rmation. We note we have also revise d the proposed regulati on t ext for making directory information available through an A PI to specify consistently that the directory information must be complete and accurate and that updates must be made in \"calendar\" days. The Provider Directory API is being finalized at 42 CFR 422.120 for MA organizations, at 42 CFR 431.70 for Medicaid state agencies, at 42 CFR 438.242(b)(6) for Medicaid managed care plans, at 42 CFR 457.760 for CHIP state agencies, and at 42 CFR 457.1233( d)(3) for CHIP CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 204 managed care entities. We are finalizing that a ccess to the published Provider Directory API must be fully implemented by January 1, 2021 for all payers subject to this new requirement. We encourage payers to implement this Provider Directo ry API as soon as they are able to make and show progress toward the API requirements in this final rule and to signal their commitment to making the information that will empower their patients easily accessible and usable. Under this final rule, MA organizations, Medicaid and CHIP FFS programs, Medicaid managed care plans, and CHIP managed care entities must make the Provider Directory API accessible via a public - facing digital endpoint on their website to ensure public discovery and access. V. The Heal th Information Exchange and Care Coordination Across Payers: Establishing a Coordination of Care Transaction to Communicate Between Plans Provisions, and Analysis of and Responses to Public Comments We proposed a new requirement for MA organizations, Medicaid managed care plans, CHIP managed care entities, and QHP issuers on the FFEs to require these payers to maintain a process to coordinate care between payers by exchanging, at a minimum, the USCDI at the enrollee's request as specified in the proposed regulation text. Instead of specifically proposing use of the USCDI, we proposed use of a content standard adopted by ONC at 45 CFR 170.213, which was proposed in a companion proposed rule, the ONC 21st Century Cures Act proposed rule as the USCDI (version 1) (84 FR 7441 through 7444). Understanding that enrollees' information is already exchanged between plans for use in carrying out various plan functions 43, payers have experience exchanging, receiving, and incorporating data from other plans into an enrollee's record. We proposed requiring the USCDI data set be exchanged at the enrollee's 43 See Office for Civil Rights. (2016, August 16). 3014-H IPAA and Health Plans - Uses and Disclosures for Care Coordination and Continuity of Care. Retrieved from https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-p rofessionals/faq/3014/uses- 205 direction, and when received by a payer, incorporated into the recipient payer's data system. As proposed, upon request from an enrollee , the USCDI dat a set would have to be sent to another payer t hat c overs the enrollee or a payer identified by t he enrollee at any time during cove rage or up to 5 years after coverage ends, and the payer would have to receive the USCDI data set from any payer that covered the enrollee within the preceding 5 years. These proposals were intended to support patient directed coordination of care; that is, each of the payers subj ect to the re quirement would be require d to, upon an enrollee's reque st: (1) receive the data set from another payer that had covered the enrollee within the previous 5 years; (2) send the data set at any time during an enrollee's enrollment and up to 5 years later, to another payer that currently covers the enrollee; and (3) send t he data set at any time during enrollment or up to 5 years after enrollment has ended to a recipient identified by the enrollee. We identified in the proposed rule that this proposal is based on our authority under sections 1856(b) and 1857(e) of the Act to adopt standards and c ontract terms for MA plans; section 1902(a)(4) of the Act to adopt methods of administration for state Medicaid plans, including requirements for Medicaid managed care plans (MCOs, PIHPs, and PAHPs); section 2101(a) of the Act for CHIP managed care entities (MCOs, PIHPs, and PAHPs); and section 1311(e)(1)(B) of the Affordable Care Act for QHP issuers on the FFEs. We explained in the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access proposed rule our belief that the proposal will help to reduce provider burden and imp rove patient access to their health information through coordination of care between payers (84 FR 7640 through 7642). We also noted that the CHIP regulations incorporate and apply, through an existing cross-r eference at 42 CFR 457.1216, the Medicaid managed care plan r equirements codified at 42 CFR 438.62(b)(1)(vi). Therefore, the proposal for Medicaid managed care plans described also ap plied to CHIP managed care entities CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 206 even though we did not propose new regulati on text in part 457. W e proposed that this new requirement would be applicable starting January 1, 2020 for MA organizations, Medicaid managed care plans, CHIP managed care entities , and beginning with plan year s beginning on or after January 1, 2020 for QHP issuers on the FFEs. Among other topi cs relate d to the proposal, we sol icited comments on the propos ed date these policies would be applicable. We proposed to codify this new requirement at 42 CF R 422. 119(f) for MA organizations; at 42 CFR 438.62( b)( 1)(vi) for Medicaid managed care plans (and by extension under existing rules at 42 CFR 457.121 6, to CHIP managed care entities); and at 45 CFR 156.221( f) for QHP issuers on the FFEs. The proposed new requirement was virtuall y identical for MA organiz ations, Medicaid managed c are plans, C H IP m anaged c are entities, and QHP issuers on the FFEs, with modifications in the proposal necessary for specific payer types to account for the program needs of each. The proposed regulati on t ext references the content standard adopted at 45 CFR 170.213, which ONC proposed as the USCDI (version 1) data set (84 FR 7441 through 7444). We noted we believed that exchanging this data set would help both enrollees and health care providers coordinate care and reduce administrative burden t o ens ure t hat pa yers provide coordinated high- quality c a re in an efficient and c ost-effective w ay that protects pr ogram integrity. For a ful l discussion of the be nefits w e anticipate fr om this d ata exchange requirement, see the discussion in the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access proposed rule (84 FR 7640). In addition to the benefits for care coordination at the payer level and reduced provider burden, we noted that once the requested information, as specified by the USCDI standard, was made available to the patient's current plan, the enrollee would have access to multiple years of their health information through the proposed Patient Access API, discussed in section III.C. of the CMS Interoperability an d Patient Access proposed rule and in this final rule. This is the case CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 207 because the proposa l required the receiving pa yer to inc orporate the received da ta int o its records about the patient, t he refore making these data the payer m aintains, and da ta available to sh are with t he patient via the Patient A ccess API. T he USCDI da ta set includes clinical data poi nts essential for care coordination. Acces s to t hese data would provide the patient with a more comprehensive history of their medical care, he lp ing them to make better inf ormed he alth c a r e decisions . We sought comm ent on how plans mi ght combine records and addr ess error reconciliation or other factors in establishing a more longitudinal record for each patient. We proposed to allow multiple methods for electronic exchange of the information, including use of the APIs proposed in sect ion III. of the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access proposed rule (84 FR 7627 through 7639), to allow for patient-mediated exchange of payer information or direct payer-to-payer communication, subject to HIPAA requirements, 42 CFR part 2, and other applicable federal and state laws. We noted that we considered requiring the use of the FHIR-based API discussed in section III. of the proposed rule for this information exchange; however, we understood that some geographic areas might have a regional health information exchange (HIE) that could coordinate such data transfers for any HIE-participating MA plans, Medicaid managed care plans, CHIP managed care entities, and QHP issuers on the FFEs that are subject to the proposal. We sought comment on whether it would be beneficial to interoperability and patient care coordination for us to require the use of the FHIR-b ased API otherwise proposed, and whether this should be the only mechanism allowed for this exchange, or whether multiple methods for electronic exchange of the information should be allowed under the proposed policy and whether CMS might be able to leverage its program authority to facilitate the data exchanges contemplated b y the proposal. We expected enrollees to have constant acc ess to requesting an exchange of data as the proposal would require exchange of the CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 208 USCDI data set whenever an enrollee makes such a request, which may occur at times other than enrollment or disenrollment. We acknowledged that in some cases payers subject to the proposed requirement may be exchanging patient health information with other payers that are not similarly required to exchange USCDI data sets for enrollees, for example, if a consumer changes their health coverage from a QHP on an FFE to employer-sponsored cove rage, and we requested comment on how to support patients and providers in those situations. We also proposed that a patient should be able to request his or her information from their prior payer up to 5 years after dis -enrollment, which is considerably less than existing data retention policies for some of the payers. 44 Further, we proposed that the health information received as part of the USCDI (version 1) data set under our proposal would have to be incorporated into the IT and data systems of each payer that receives the USCDI data set under the proposed requirement, such that the enrollee's data would be cumulative and move with the enrollee as he or she changes enrollment. For example, if a patient is enrolled in Plan 1 in 2020 and Plan 2 in 2021, then requests the data from Plan 1 to be sent to Plan 2, Plan 2 would have at least 2 years (2020 and 2021) of health information for that patient. If the patient moves to Plan 3 in 2022, Plan 3 should receive both 2020 and 2021 data from Plan 2 at the pati ent's request. While the proposal would require compliance (and thus exchange of these data sets) only by MA plans, Medicaid managed care plans, CHIP managed care entities, and QHP issuers on the FFEs, we noted that we hoped that compliance by these payers could be the first step toward adoption and implementation of these standards on a voluntary basis by other payers throughout the health care system. 44 Under 42 CFR 422.504(d) and 438.3(u), MA organizations and Medicaid managed care plans, and CHIP plans must retain records for at least 10 years. Under 45 CFR 156.705; 45 CFR 155.1210(b)(2), (3) and (5), QHP issuers on the FFEs must also retain records for 10 years. CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 209 Research indicates that the completeness of a patient record and the availability of up -to- date and relev ant health information at the point of care can have a significant impact on patient outcomes.45 We noted that we believe the proposal for MA organizations, Medicaid managed care plans, CHIP managed care entities, and QHP issuers on the FFEs to exchange th e USCDI data set in particular scenarios would support improvement in care coordination by allowing for sharing of key patient health information when an enrollee requests it. We proposed that the payers subject to this new requirement would be required to exchange, at a minimum, the data classes and elements included in the content standard proposed to be adopted at 45 CFR 170.213 in the ONC 21st Century Cures Act proposed rule, specifically, the USCDI (version 1) data set. On behalf of HHS, ONC proposed to adopt the USCDI as a standard (84 FR 7441 through 7444), to be codified at 45 CFR 170.213, and the proposed regulation text cross -references this regulation. These data exchanges would provide the enrollee's new payer with a core set of data that could be used to support better care coordination and improved outcomes for the enrollee. We considered requiring plans to exchange all the data that we proposed be available through an API (see section III. of the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access proposed rule (84 FR 7627 through 7639)) but we understood that ingesting data and reconciling errors has challenges and proposed this more limited data set to address those concerns. We sought comment on whether the USCDI data set would be comprehensive enough to facilitate the type of care coordination and patient access described in the proposal, or whether additional data fields and data elements that would be available under the API proposal in section III. of the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access proposed rule (84 FR 7627 through 45 Office of the National Coordinator. (2019, June 4). Improved Diagnostics & Patient Outcomes. Retrieved from https://www.healthit.gov/topic/health 7639) should also be required. For a full discussion of the benefits of the USCDI for this data exchange, see the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access proposed rule (84 FR 7641). We stated that we believed that the proposed requirement would also support dually eligible individuals who are concurrently enrolled in MA plans and Medicaid managed care plans. Under the proposal, both of the dually eligible individual's payers would be subject to the requirement to exchange that individual's data in the form of the USCDI, which should improve the ability of both payers to coordinate care based on that data, as discussed in the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access proposed rule (84 FR 7642). We sought comment on how payers should coordinate care and exchange information for dually eligible individuals. We also sought comment on the associated burden on plans to exchange the USCDI data set under the proposal. In addition, we noted that we were interested in comments about potentia l legal barriers to exchanging the USCDI data set as would be required under the proposal; for example, whether there were federal, state, local, and tribal laws governing privacy for specific use cases (such as in the care of minors or for certain behavio ral health treatments) that would raise additional considerations that we should address in this regulation or in guidance. We stated that activities related to the proposed requirement could qualify as a quality improvement activity (QIA) meeting the criteria described in section 2718(a)(2) of the PHSA for purposes of the Medical Loss Ratio (MLR) requirements for QHP issuers on an FFE 46, and similar standards for treatment of QIA standards applicable to Medicaid managed care plans (MCOs, PIHPs, and PAHPs) under 42 CFR 438.8, CHIP managed care entities under 42 CFR 457.1203(f), and MA plans under 42 CFR 422.2400 through 422.2490. An entity's MLR is 46 While this rulemaking is specific to QHP issuers participating on the FFEs, we note that to the extent other commercial market issuers incur similar costs for coverage sold in the individual or group markets, those expenses may similarly qualify as QIA. CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 211 generally calculated as the proportion of revenue spent on clinical services and QIA. There are several specifi c criteria an expense must meet, such as being designed to improve health quality and health outcomes through activities such as care coordination, in order to qualify as QIA.47 We requested comments related to this assumption and its implications. We summarize the public comments we received on the payer -to-payer data exchange, as well as on whether these new activities may qualify as QIA for MLR purposes, and provide our responses. Comment: Many commenters were very supportive of this proposal and indica ted their belief that these new data exchange requirements could improve care coordination by reducing burden on both beneficiaries and providers by limiting the need for duplicative letters of medical necessity, preventing inappropriate step therapy, and reducing unnecessary utilization reviews and prior authorizations. Response : We appreciate the commenters' support for this payer- to-payer data exchange proposal. We are finalizing this proposal with some modifications as detailed below. Under this final rule, payers subject to this requirement must maintain a process for the ele ctronic exchange of, at a minimum, the data classes and elements included in the content standard finalized by HHS in the ONC 21st Century Cures Act final rule (published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register ) at 45 CFR 170.213, which is currently version 1 of the USCDI. We are also finalizing that payers must use this process to exchange the USCDI -defined data set with the approval and at the direction of a current or former enrollee, or the enrollee's personal representative, to align with the language used for the API requirements. Furthermore, we are finalizing the proposal that upon receipt, the receiving payer must incorporate the data set into 47 See, for example, 45 CFR 158.150 and 45 CFR 158.151. CMS -9115-F CPL the payer's own re cords about the enrollee w ith a clarification tha t thi s obligation a pplies to records about current enrollees. We clarify here that incorporati ng the data into t he payer's r ecords under this specific regulation would not require that the payer treat or rely on these data as its own, but that the payer m ust include th ese data in the record i t maintains for each e nrollee. W hile the obligation to incorporate d ata received from other payers in to the re ceiving payer's records applies only for data about cur rent enrollees, once incorporated, these data must be maintained eve n after a current enrolle e leaves the payer's coverage. We do not want to be overly pr escriptive about how these data are used by each pa yer at this time. Initially, we are only re quiring tha t these da ta a re inc orporated in to the existing r ecord to facilitate the creation and maintenance of a patient's cumulative health record w ith their cu rrent payer. I n subsequent r ulemaki ng, however, we may be mo re specific, depending on proposed use cases, and propose more prescriptive use of specific data. Comment : Some commenters expressed concern about each payer's increased access to clinical information impacting coverage decision-m aking. Commenters noted that while historically physicians have controlled the p atient's clinical data in determining what to submit to obtain reimbursement for care provided, payers would now have access to information outside of the scope of the specific service being billed by a provider. Commenters noted that a payer may access the exchanged health data from a prior payer an d determine that a patient has already received treatment for a condition and deny, delay, and/or require prior authorization for allegedly duplicative treatment. Additionally, a few commenters expressed concern that payers may use prior information to restrict coverage for medically necessary care that a patient may have received previously. A few commenters recommended that CMS require that payers must CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 213 attest t hat the exchanged da ta cannot be used t o deny or delay tr eatment, i ncrease rates, or imple ment step the rapy. Response : We appr eciate the commenters' concerns. We note that this regulation does not make any cha nges to w hen pa yers can de ny coverage. T he dat a received via this data exchange must be used per al l appl icable law, regulation, and in acco rdance with pa y er cont racts as it relates to coverage decisions and, specifically, coverage denial. Nothing in this regulation changes any existing obligations or policies related to coverage or services. Further, as proposed and finalized, the regulations regarding the exchange of data among payers is triggered by an enrollee's request that the information be sent or received and incorporated. The individual enrollee retains control in this situation and can refrain from requesting information be sent to a new or current payer. We do not e, however, t hat there are currently sc enarios wher e payers can exchange data without an enrollee's request , such as for paym ent and health care operations. Comment: Several commenters were concerned about the r esponsibility o f MA plans, Medicai d managed care plans, C HIP m anaged c are entities, a nd QHP issue rs on the FFEs to forward in formation from other payers or information from out side the ir organization w here the y di d not control data integrity. Als o, commenters were conce rned there might be information that is contradictory and were unsure of each payer's responsibilities in that case. Response: We appreciate the commenters' concerns. We do believe that patients have a right to their data. In addition, they have a right to request that their health data follow them throughout their health care journey. It is only when patients are able to facilitate the sharing of their data, and even see it themselves, such as via the Patient Access API, that they will be able to understand where there may be opportunities to work with their previous and current providers and payers to ensure they have an accurate health record. Today, to the extent permitted by law, CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 214 payers may exchange pati ent data without the patient's consent for various purposes including payment and healt h care operations . T he policy w e are fi nalizing here will allow the patient to facilitate tha t exchange of their health inf ormation. In us ing this process, p atients c a n e nsure the ir paye rs and providers have the most a ccurate and up-to-date information about them. Paye rs can choose to indicate which data being exchanged w ere received from a previous paye r so the receiving payer, or even a patient, understands whe re to direct questions and is aware of the scope of control over data in tegrity. T his will also help receiving payers and patients understand how to reconcil e cont radictory i nformation as it can b e made clear w here questions should be directed. Payers are unde r no obligation under this regulation to update, validate, or correc t data receive d from another payer. Comment: Several com mente rs agreed w ith the proposed su ggestion that act ivities related to this pr oposa l m ay qua lify a s Q IA me eting the criteria de s cribed in s ection 2718(a)(2) of the PHSA for purposes of the MLR re qui rements for QHP issuers on t he FFEs, and si milar standards for t reatment of qua lity im provement s tandards applicable to Medicaid m anage d car e plans (MCOs, PIHPs, and PAHPs) under 42 CFR 438.8, CHIP manage d care entities under 42 CFR 457.1203(f), and MA plans under 42 CFR 422.2400 through 422.2490. Response: We confirm that we continue to believe that expenses for the care coordination data exchanges required by this final rule may qualify as QIA for purposes of calculating the MLR for payers that engage in such exchanges. As noted above, wh ile this rulemaking is specific to QHP issuers participating on the FFEs, to the extent other commercial market issuers incur similar costs for coverage sold in the individual or group markets, those expenses may similarly qualify as QIA. We appreciate the commenters' support and will consider recognizing CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 215 the expenses r elated t o this data exchange as QIA i n future rulemaking or guidance, a s may be necessary. Comment: Many commenters were c once rned a bout the time fra me to implement this provisi on and were conce rned making this policy applicable in 2020 would not provide enough time to ope rationalize th is pol icy. Response: We appreciate the commenters' conc erns and understand t hat it will take time to ful ly and properly implement this pol icy. We are finalizing thi s payer-to-payer dat a exchange requirement with an applicability date of January 1, 2022 with respect to the exchange of the U SCDI da ta set. Although we did not propose to require payers to use an API to exchange the USCDI under this payer- to-payer data exchange proposal, we appreciate and support that some payers would l ike to leverage the Patient A ccess API ( discus sed in section III. of this f inal rule ) to meet the requirements of this pa yer-to-payer da ta exchange. T he Patient A ccess API r equirement makes USCDI da ta available to the patient or a third pa rty at the patient's direction. Because the Patient A ccess API is facilitating the exchange of the USCDI, some of the work to develop an API to exchange these data and the work to map the rel evant USCDI data will be completed by January 1, 2 021, when t he Patient A ccess API m ust be made available a s finalized in sect ion III. of this rule. I n addition, if a payer r eceives dat a via an A PI, the payer cou ld then incorporat e it into a pa tient's r e cord and in tur n s hare i t with th e pa tient via t he Patient Access A P I with l ittle additional work needed. We appreciate the value of using an API for this data exchange, and we understand the efficiencies that it can add to both this payer -to-payer data exchange as well as the Patient Access API policy. We also appreciate that incorporating data from other payers received via an CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 216 API will be a new expe rience for pa yers, how ever. F or instance, pa ye rs will ne ed to develop a process to incorporate da ta fro m other payers in to the ir systems, inc luding potentially p rocesses for tagging these data as originati ng with another payer so t hey c an efficiently s hare th at information with pa tients and future payers. T hese are additional processing steps that t ake time to imp lement. In evaluating the comments on the proposals in this rule, and appreciating the value of shari ng and exchanging data via APIs, w e see the benefit of h aving all data exchanged via APIs. Therefore , we may consider for fut ure rulemaking an API-based payer- to-payer data exchange. At this t ime, we believe that an applicability date of January 1, 2022 for compliance with this requiremen t is appropriate. T hi s provides ti me fo r payers to g et experience with the Patient A ccess A PI, and provides pa ye rs with addi tiona l time to fully a nd successfully imp lement this payer-t o-payer data exchange requirement. To support a more seam less data exchange and to further clarify this payer-t o-payer data exchange requirement, we are finalizing some modifications of the proposed regulation text at 42 CFR 4 22.119(f)(1)(ii) and (iii) for MA organizations; at 42 CFR 438.62(b)(1)(vi)(B) and (C) for Medicaid managed care plans (and by cross-reference from 42 CFR 457.1216, to CHIP managed care entities); and at 45 CFR 156.221(f)(1)(ii) and (iii) for QHP issuers on the FFEs to clearly indicate payers are obligated under this proposal to, with the ap proval and at the direction of a current or former enrollee, exchange data with any other payer identified by the enrollee. The proposed regulation text used both the term \"recipient\" and \"any other health care plan\" to identify where these data would be sent at an enrollee's request; the term \"recipient\" could have been interpreted more broadly than we intended. In the final regulation text, we are using \"payer\" instead and consolidating the proposed provisions that would require the payer that is CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 217 subject to these rules to send data at the enro llee's request at any time during enrollment or up to 5 years after enrollmen t e nds. As di scussed in s e ction III. o f this fin al rul e, we are also specifying in t he final regulations that a payer is only required to s end data received under this payer -to- payer data e xchange requirement in the electronic for m a nd format it was re c eived. In this w ay, a payer would not be asked to receive paper records from another payer under this policy and then in turn share those paper records with another payer in the future a t the patient's d ire ction. If the paye r received a patient's information via an A PI, the payer must sha re i t via an A PI if the payer t hey are sending to has the capacity t o receive it. I f a patient r equest s that a former p ayer send the ir information to the ir ne w pa yer and the n requests th at the ir new pa yer ma ke their data accessi ble via that n ew pa yer's Patient Access API, t he new payer w ould onl y be required to include the information received fro m the for mer payer at the pa tient's d irection if this ne wly a cquired information was received via a FHIR-based API. Otherwise, the new payer is only required t o share data via t he Patient A ccess API t hat the payer al ready maintains and has prepared to be shared via a FHIR-based API. We are also finalizing new regulation text, at 4 2 CFR 422.119(h) for MA organizations; at 42 CFR 438.62(b)(1)(vii) for Medicaid managed care plans (and by cross-reference from 42 CFR 457.1216, to CHIP managed care entities); and at 45 CFR 156.221(i) for QHP issuers on the FFEs, that these regulated payers will need to comply with the payer-to-p ayer data exchange requirements beginning January 1, 2022 (or beginning with plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2022 for QHP issuers on the FFEs). In addition, this requirement, as finalized, provides that payers are required to exchange data they maintain with a date of service on or after January 1, 2016. In this way, payers only have to prepare a defined initial historical set of data for sharing via this payer-t o-payer data exchange policy, as also required under the Patient CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 218 Access API pol icy d iscussed i n section I II. of this final r u le. We believe that de laying implementation to January 1, 2022 and specifying that only data with a date of se rvice on or after January 1, 2016 must be exchange d under the new re quirement addresses concerns about the timing and level of burden invol ve d in me eting this re quirement. T hi s also clarifies th a t if certain inf ormati on is not maintained by the paye r, the payer is not obligated to seek out and obtai n the dat a. We a lso sought comment on how this pol icy might impact dually e ligibl e individuals. We summarize the publi c comments w e received on t his payer -to-payer d ata exchange specifically regarding our request for comment for how this p olicy might i mpact dually e ligib le individuals who are concurrently enrolled in MA plans and Medicaid managed care plans and provi de our responses. Comment: A few commenters supporte d the proposal bec ause it coul d improve care coordi nation for dually e ligi ble be neficiaries. O ne commente r noted tha t because o f this proposal, MA plans and Medicaid MCO plans woul d have the same data and health histor y for an i ndividual. One commenter believed that this could hel p states that do not have an easily accessible source of data for know ing w hen t he ir Medicaid b eneficiari es are enrolled for Me dicare. This commenter recommended including enrollment source and enrollment and disenrollment dat es in t he data exchanged between pa ye rs. Response : We appreciate the commenters' support and the suggestion noted. We wi ll further evaluate this suggestion for future consideration. Comment: One commenter requested additional information regarding how plans should account for gaps in plan coverage over the course of 5 years. The commenter believed this will CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 219 be particularly important for dual eligible and Medicaid beneficiaries who m ay move in and out of a health p lan program as their s tatus may cha nge due to cha nging circumstances. Response : We appreciate the commenter's request for i nformation. We note that on e paye r would only be obligated t o send another paye r information that the payer maintains (which could inc lude da ta received from other payers und er this f inal rule that must be incorporated int o the current payer's records). If in the 5 years prior to Januar y 1, 2022, a pati ent was in a Medicaid managed care plan for 1 year in 2019 and then there was a break in service with the patient returning for 1 year in 2021, this Medicaid managed care plan would be required to share data from 2019 and 2021 if requested by the patient. It would not be the managed care plan's r esponsibility to address the gaps in the data that the plan maintains. Assuming that the pat ient was enrolled in an MA plan or another Medicai d managed care plan i n 2020, the patient could request that the plan they had in 2020 independently se nd their data to t he payer th e y have indicated. In this way, the indicated payer is now the holder of the comprehensive information, as unde r this requirement a pa yer mus t incorporate the data received f rom other payers unde r this polic y into their data sys tem. If the pa tient leaves to go to a new payer in 2023, the one payer that now maintains their data from 2019 to 2022 would be the one paye r that could forward the data to the new p ayer, i n the electronic form and format i t was received. We acknowledge that this may be complex for dually eligible beneficiaries. Comment : A few commenters noted ad vantages, burdens, and complexities associated with plans serving dually eligible beneficiaries continuously aggregating real-t ime member data from multiple plans. One commenter noted that each payer should only be responsible for their own data set and the coordination of data across multiple plans and providers would be more ideally done through a Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement (TEFCA). This CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 220 commente r noted tha t additional technica l c apabilities w ill be required d ue to the possibility o f ove rlappi ng coverage whe n combining and incorporating records. Response : We appreciate these thoughtful comments. We note that thi s pa yer-to-payer data exchange is only required when init iated by an enrollee's request, and only applies to the payers who are subject to our fi nal regulations at 42 CFR 422.119(f)(1) and (h) for MA orga nizations; 42 CFR 438.62( b)(1)(vi) and (vii) for Medicaid managed care plans (and by cross- reference from 42 CFR 457.1216, to CHIP managed care entities); and at 45 CFR 156.221(f ) and (i) for QHP issue rs on the FFEs. T he enrollee may r eque st this payer -to-payer exc hange just once, or more frequently. We did not propose, and are not finalizing, a ny requirement for cont inuous data exchange, however. Final Action : After consideration of the comments received, and for the reasons outlined in our response to t hese comm ents and in the CMS I nter operability and P atient A ccess proposed rule, we are finalizing with modifications our proposal at 42 CFR 422.11 9(f )(1) and 438.62(b)(1)(vi), a nd f)(1) to require MA organi zations, Medic aid managed care plans, CHIP managed car e entities, and QHP issuers on t he FFEs to maintain a proc ess for the electronic exchange of, at a minimum, the data cl asses and el ements included i n the content st andar d adopted at 45 CFR 170.213 (currently version 1 of the USC DI), as outlined in section III. of this fi na l rule. S pecifically, we are finalizing a s proposed tha t the payers s ubjec t to these re gulations incorporate t he data the y receive into the enrollee's re c ord. In the final regulation t ext, w e are using the language \"with the approval and at t he direction\" of t he enroll ee ve rsus \"at the request\" of the enrollee to align with the language used for the API requirements. We are finalizing modifications to the proposed regulation text to streamline the te xt and best specify the scope of the policy as intended, as well as to align the text for all payer types as CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 221 appropriate . Specifically, at 42 C 438.62(b)(1)(vi)(A) (and by cross- reference at 45 CFR 156.221( f)(1)(i), the regulation te xt states tha t relevant payers \"receive\" versus \"accept\" data current enr t 45 CFR 156.221(f) (1)(ii), the final regulations provi de that a payer must send the defined information set to any ot her payer. In addition, a t 42 CFR 422.119(f)(1)(iii), 438.62(b)(1)(vi)(C) (and by cross - reference from 42 457.1216), and at 45 CFR 156.221( f)(1)(iii), we specif y that a payer is onl y obligated to send data receive d from another paye r under this policy in the electronic for m and format it was received. This is intended t o reduce burden on pa yers. We note the final regulations do use the term \"pa yer\" in place of \" health care plan\" to clarify tha t the s cope of the obli gations are for all payers impacted by this regulation. Also at 45 CFR 156.221( f)(1), we updated the title of the paragraph t o align with the para llel regulations for other payers types, and we corrected an i ncomplet e senten ce. F inally, we specify t hat this policy also app lies to an enrollee' s personal r epresentative. We ar e also finalizing regulation text to addr ess when t hese regulated pa yers must comply with these new requirements at 42 CFR 422.119( h) for MA organizations; at 42 CF R 438.62(b) (1)(vii) for Medicai d managed care pla ns (and at 42 CFR 457.1216, to CHIP managed care entities); and at 45 CFR 156.22 1(i) for QHP issuers on the FFEs. Starting January 1, 2022, and for QHP issuers on the FFEs starting with plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2022, the finalized r egulation requir es t hese payer s to exchange data with a date o f service on or after J anuary 1, 2016 that meets the requirements of this section and which the payer maintai ns. In this way, payers only have to prepare an initial historical set of data for sharing via this payer-t o- CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 222 payer da ta exchange policy t hat is co nsistent w it h the data set to be available through the Patient Access API, as finalized in sec tion III. of this final rule. VI. Care Coordination Through T rusted E xchange Networks: Trust E xchange Network Requirements for MA Plans, Med icaid Man aged C are Plans, C HIP Man aged C are Entities, an d QHP i ssuers on the FFEs Provisions, an d A nalysis of an d Responses to P ublic Comments We propose d to r equir e MA p lans, Medicaid m anaged ca re plans, C HIP m anaged c are entities , and QHP issuers on the FF Es to participate in trust networks in order to improve int eroperabilit y in these programs. We noted that we woul d codif y this requirement in, 438.242(b)(5), and b)(5)) and 45 CFR 156.221(f) . In general, payers and pat ients' ability to com municate between themselves and with health care providers could c onsiderably improve patient access to data, reduce provider burden, a nd reduce redundant and unnec essary procedures. Trusted exchange networks allow for broader interoperabilit y beyond one heal th system or point to point connections among payers, providers, and patients. Such networks establis h rules of the roa d for interoperability, a nd with maturing technology, such net works are scaling interoperability and gathering momentum with participants, including several f ederal ag encies, EHR vendors, retail pharmac y chains, large prov ider associations, and others. The impor tance of a trusted e xchange fra mework to s uch in te roperability is reflec ted in section 4003(b) of the Cures Act, which was discussed in more detail in section I.D. of the CMS I nteroperabilit y and Patient Acc ess proposed rule (84 FR 7612 through 7614). In section VI. of the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access proposed rule (84 FR 7642), we discussed and CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 223 explained our proposal to require certain payers to participate in trusted exchange networks. A trusted exc hange framework al lows f or the secu re exchang e of electronic he al th information with, and use of electronic health information from, other health IT. Widespread payer participation in such a framework might allow for more complete access and exchange of all electronically access ible he alth information for authorized us e under applicable stat e or federal l aw, which we believe would lead to better use of such data. We noted that while we ca nnot require widespread payer participation in trust networks, we proposed to use our program authority i n the MA program, Medicaid managed ca re program, CHIP managed care program, and QHP c e rtification program for the F F Es to in crease pa r ticipation in trust networks and to bri ng the potential benefits of participati ng in such programs, includi ng improved interoperable com munication and care coordination, which result in opportunities for improved patient outcomes and burden reduction. We proposed to require , beginning January 1, 2020, that MA plans, Medicaid managed care plans, CHIP managed car e entities, and QHP issue rs on the FFEs participat e in a trusted exchange network. The proposal was based on our authorit y under: sections 1856( b) and 1857(e) of the Act to adopt standards and contract terms f or MA pl ans; section 1902(a)(4) of the A ct to adopt me thods of administrati on for the administration state Medicaid plans, including r equirements for Med icaid m ana ged care plans (MCOs, P IHPs, and PAHPs); sect ion 2101( a) for CHIP m a nage d care entities (MCOs, P IHPs, a nd PAHPS); and s ection 3 001(c)(9)(F)(iii) of the PH SA and section 1311(e)(1)(B) of the Affordable Care Act for QHP issuers on an FFE. Under the proposal, and consistent with section 4003(b) of the Cures Act, participation would be required in a trusted exchange framework that met the following criteria: CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 224 (1) The trusted exchange network must be able to exchange PHI, defined at 45 CFR 160.103, in compliance with all applicable state and federal laws across jurisdictions. (2)The trusted exchange network must be capable of connecting both inpatient EHRs and ambulatory EHRs. (3) The trusted exchange network must support secure messaging or electronic querying by and between patients, providers, and payers. We proposed to codify these requirements for these payers at 42 CFR 422.119(f)(2) for MA organizations, \u00a7 438.242(b)(5) for Medicaid managed care plans, \u00a7 457.1233(d)(2) for CHIP managed care entities, and 45 CFR 156.221(f) for QHPs on the FFEs. On April 19, 2019, ONC released the draft Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement (TEFCA Draft 2) for public comment.48 Previous commenters on draft 1 of the TEFCA, particularly payers providing comments, requested that existing trust networks that are operating successfully be leveraged in further advancing interoperability; thus, we considered a possible future approach to payer- to-payer and payer -to-provider interoperability that leverages existing trust networks to support care coordination and improve patient access to their data. We requested comments on this approach and how it might be aligned in the future with section 4003(b) of the Cures Act. We also requested comments on the applicability date we proposed for the trusted exchange network participation requirement and what benefits and challenges the payers subject to our proposal might face meeting this requirement for additional consideration in future rulemaking. We summarize the public comments we received on this topic and provide our responses. 48 See https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/page/2019 -04/FINALTEFCAQTF41719508version.pdf . For additional Although many stakeholders supported the concept of this proposal, there were strong exceptions. Ma ny comm enter s, particularly pa yers, i ndicated t hat it was premature for CMS to finalize a proposal related to trus ted exchange network pa rt icipation before the first vers ion of the C ommon Agreemen t under ONC's T EF CA was fina lized. Commenters not ed tha t, e ven though they supported usi ng a trusted exchange net work, it would not be advisable until after TEFCA a s out lined in section 4003 of the 21st Ce ntury Cures Act was available to facilitate this proposal. Response : We a ppreciate tha t although commenters supported the general concept of trusted exchange network participation and how it could advance interoperability and data exchange, t he true value of this conc ept mi ght be be st r ealized via TEFCA in t he future. We agree that trusted exc hange networks can play a positive role, but given t he concerns c ommenters raised regarding the need f or a mature TEFCA , and appreciating the ongoing w ork on TEFCA be ing done at this ti me, we are not finalizing this policy a t this tim e. Com ment : Some c ommenters no ted that mo re detail would be needed to understand how this proposal would be operationalized. These commenters also indicate d more information woul d be needed to understand how this policy would relate to existing Healt h Information Exc hanges (HIEs) and Healt h Information Networks (HINs) and whether these entities would qualify as trusted exchange networks. A few commenters indicated this polic y may be redundant appreciating the existing role of HIEs and HINs. Response : We appreciate the commenters' concerns and requests for additional information. We will keep these in mind as we consider possible future proposals around participation in trusted exchange networks. CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 226 Comment: Many commenters expressed concerns with the proposed implementation timeline. They did not believe this policy coul d be implemented by January 1, 2020. Comme nters indi cated i t would ta ke more time to me et the necessary requirements an d fully unders tand the implications of the policy, particularly for HIEs and HINs. Many commenters suggested a delay ranging from 12 to 24 months . Other commenters suggested CMS align t he timeline of this pr oposa l with T EFCA impl emen tation milestones. In a ddition to a de l ay, some commenters sugge sted a n exe mption process. Response : We appreciate t he commenters concerns, and based on these concerns and those summarized f rom other co mm enters, w e are not finalizi ng this propos al at this time. T o reflec t thi s in thi s final rule, the regulation tex t proposed for all impacted payers is not being finalized. In addition, a s 42 CFR 438.242(b)( 5) is not being finalized, the regulati on text proposed a t 42 CFR 438.242(b)(6) is being redesignated as 42 CFR 438.2 42(b)(5). Final Action: After consideration of the c omments received, and for the reasons outlined in our response to t hese comments, we are not fina lizing this proposa l to require M A organizat ions, Medicaid managed c are plans, C HIP m anaged c are entities, and QHP issuers on the FFEs to participate in a truste d exchange network. VII. Improving t he Medicare- Medicaid D ually E ligible Experience by In creasin g the Frequency of Federal -State Data Exc hanges Provisi ons, and Analysis of and Resp onses to Public C omments A. Increasing the Frequency of Federal- State Data Exchanges f or Dually Eligible I ndividuals 1. Background The Medicare and Medicaid programs were originally created as distinct programs with different purposes. The programs have different rules for eligibility, covered benefits, and CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 227 payment. The programs have operated as separate and distinct systems despite a growing number of people who depend on both programs (known as dually eligible individuals) for their health care. T here is an i ncreasing need to align t hese programs - and t he data and sys t ems that suppor t them - to improve care delivery and the beneficiary experience for dually eligible individuals, while reducing administrative burden for providers, health plans, and states. The interoperability of state and CMS el igibility and Med icaid Management Information Syst em (MMIS) systems is a critical part of modernizing the programs and improvi ng bene ficiary an d provider experiences. Improving the accurac y of data on dual el igibility by increasing the frequency of federal- state data exchanges is a strong first step in improving how thes e systems work together. 2. Data Exchange s to Support State Buy- in for Medicare P arts A a nd B States and CMS routinely exchange data on who is enrolle d in Medicare and Medicaid, and which pa rties are liable for paying t hat be neficiary's Parts A and B premiums. T hese data exchanges support state, CMS, and Social Security Administrati on (SSA) premium ac counting, collections , and enrollment funct ions. Section 1843 of the Act permits states to enter into an agreement with the Secretary to fa cilitate s tate \" buy-in,\" that is , payment of Medicare premiums, in this case Part B premiums, on be half of cer tain individuals. F or those beneficiaries cove red under the agreement, the state pays the beneficiary's monthly Part B premium. Section 1818(g) of the Act establishes the option for states to a mend their buy- in agreement to in c lude enrollment a nd payment of the P art A premiu m for certain s pecified ind i viduals. A ll states a nd the D istrict of Columbia have a Part B buy-in agreement; 36 states a nd the District o f Columbia h ave a Part A buy-i n agreement. To effectuate the state payment of Medicare Part A or Part B premiums, a state submits data on a buy-i n file to CMS via an electronic file transfer (EFT) exchange setup. The state's CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 228 input file includes a record for each Medicare beneficiary for whom the sta te is adding or deleting coverage, or changing buy-in status. In response, CMS returns an updated transaction record that provides data identifying, for each transaction on the state file, whether CMS accepted, modified, or rejected it, as well a Part A or Part B billing record showing the state's premium responsibility. In addition, the CMS file may \"push\" new updates obtained from SSA to the state, for example, changes to the Medicare Beneficiary Identifier number or a change of address. We have issued r egulations for certain details of the state buy -in processes. For Medicare Part A, 42 CFR 407.40 describes the option for states to amend the buy- in agreement to cover Part A premiums for Qualified Medicare Beneficiaries (QMBs). For Medicare Part B, 42 CFR 406.26 codifies the process for modifying the buy-in agreement to identify the eligibility groups covered. CMS subregulatory guidance, specifically Chapter 3 of the State Buy-in Manual, 49 specifies that states should exchange buy -in data with CMS at least monthly, but describes the option for states to exchange buy- in data with CMS daily or weekly. Likewise, states can choose to receive the CMS response data file daily or monthly. We note that 35 states and the District of Columbia are now submitting buy- in data to CMS daily; 31 states and the District of Columbia are now receiving buy- in response files from CMS daily. While many states submit and receive buy -in files daily, some continue to only do so on a monthly basis. We have become increasingly concerned about the limitations of monthly buy-in data exchanges with states. The relatively long lag in updating buy- in data means that the state is not able to terminate or activate buy -in coverage sooner, so the state or beneficiary may be 49 Centers for Medicare and M edicaid Services.

CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 229 paying premiums for longer than appropriate. In most cases, funds must be recouped and redistributed -a burdensome administrative process involving debits and payments between the beneficiary, state, CMS, and SSA. Additionally, transaction errors do occur in the current data exchange processes. In a monthly exchange, it can take multiple months to correct and resubmit an improperly processed transaction, exacerbating the delays in appropriately assigning premium liability, leading to larger mispayment, recoupm ent, and redistribution of premiums. Exchanging the buy- in data with greater frequency supports more timely access to coverage. All states' systems already have the capacity to exchange buy -in data. We acknowledge that states that do not already exchange data daily will need an initial, one -time systems change to do so. However, moving to a daily data exchange would result in a net reduction of burden for states, and further, reduce administrative complexity for beneficiaries and providers. More frequent s ubmission of updates to individuals' buy- in status positively impacts all involved. For a full discussion of the benefits, see the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access proposed rule (84 FR 7643 through 7644). While there exist opportunities to modernize the platform for buy-in data exchange, we believe that an important first step is to promote the exchange of the most current available data. Section 1843(f) of the Act specifies that Part B buy -in agreements sh all contain such provisions as will facilitate the financial transactions of the State and the carrier with respect to deductions, coinsurance, and otherwise, and as will lead to economy and efficiency of operation. Further, section 1818 (g)(2)(A) of the Act on Part A buy-in identifies th is section 18 43(f) requirement as applicable to Part A buy-in. W hile the regulations governing buy- in agr eements ( see 42 C FR 406.26 and 407.40) are silent on the frequency of buy-in data exchanges, current guidance articulates that the required buy-in data may be submitted daily, weekly, or monthly. Therefore, CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 230 we proposed to establish frequency requirements in the regulations at 42 CFR 406.26(a)(1) and 407.40(c) to require all states to participate in daily exchange of buy- in data with CMS, with \"daily\" meaning every business day, but that if no new transactions are available to transmit, data would not need to be submitted on a given business day. We noted that we believe these requirements will improve the economy and efficiency of operation of the buy- in process. We proposed that states would be required to begin participating in daily exchange of buy-in data with CMS by April 1, 2022. We noted that we believe this applicability date would allow states to phase in any necessary operational changes or bundle them with any new systems implementation. In the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access proposed rule, we estimated that 19 states would need to make a system change to send buy-in data to CMS daily and 22 states would ne ed to make a system change to receive buy -in data from CMS daily (84 FR 7668). Based on more recent data, we estimate that 26 and 19 states would require such system changes, respectively. We updated our estimates to determine the one-time cost to be $85,000 per state, per change, so a state that needs to make systems updates to both send buy-in data daily, and receive buy-in data daily would have a one-time cost of just over $170,000. We sought comment on the proposals. We summarize the public comments we received on data exchanges to support state buy - in for Medicare Parts A and B and provide our responses. Comment: Almost all those who commented on these provisions supported the proposal to require that all states participate in daily exchange of buy -in data with CMS by April 1, 2022. Commenters stated that the changes would improve the timeliness and accuracy of eligibility and enrollment data, and enhance capability for coordination of benefits. Response: We appreciate the strong support for the proposed change to the regulation. CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 231 Comment: One commenter suppo rted the change, but also encouraged CMS to modify its own processes and systems to e ffectively l everage daily d ata exchange s t o su pport en hanced ca re for dually eligible individuals. Another comment er requested clarification if the daily s tate submissi on of the buy-in fi le encompasses a reciprocal d aily r espons e from C MS t o the states. R esponse: We agree that C MS and states both p lay important r oles in implementing systems changes to supp ort the state buy-in process. Currently, states can choose to exchange buy-in data with CMS daily, weekly, or monthly; and separately, the y can choose to receive the CMS response data file daily, weekly, or monthly. We proposed that all states both send data to CMS and receive responses from C MS on a daily ba sis. We w ill con t inue to l ook for opportunities to optimize CMS systems and processes to support better ca re for dually eligible individuals. Comment: One commenter suppo rted requiri ng frequent exchanges of th is data as a way to eliminate c urrent inefficiencies and impr ove b enefit coordination for the dua lly eligible popula tion so long as this requirement does not impose additional reporting requirements on clinicians. Response : We a ppreciate the s upport for our propos al. W e confirm that the regulation as proposed does not create additional reporting requirements on clinicians . As noted in the pre amble to the CMS I nteroperability and Patient A ccess pr oposed r ule, w e estimate that the change to a daily submission would result in a net reduction of burden for states, and further, reduce administrative complexity for beneficiaries and providers. Comment: One commenter noted that the proposed applicability date of April 1, 2022 will be sufficient for this change, but for overall unity in the rule's proposed changes, encouraged CMS to consider aligning the applicability date of this proposal with an overall CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 232 extended implementation tim e frame of a t least 2 ye ars\u2014and i deally 5 years - f or the remainder of the rule 's provisions. Respons e: We a ppreciate the value in aligned implementation timelines. However, given that other provisions in this rul e for health p lans a nd states a r e di stinc t from this requirement, and wi ll be required beginning in 2020, we continue to believe that the April 1, 2022 implementation timeline proposed for daily exchange of buy-in data is appropriate. Com ment: Commenters re com mend ed that C MS est ablish a process for states to provide Medica re dual el igible special ne eds plans (D -SNPs) with, at a min imum, da ta on beneficiaries' M edicaid coverage. Commenters requested CMS align the eligibility a nd e nrollment infor mation that health p lans receiv e with t he information being sha red be tween st ates and the federal gove rnment so there is a single \"source of truth\" on these data. Commenters noted this cons istency is critica l to improving care coordination for dually e ligible in dividuals. Respons e : D-SNPs have an i mportant r ole in supp orting t heir enrollees' access to Medica id be nefits. We understand that in many states D -SNPs have limited access to timely da ta on Medicaid enrollment . We note that we do provide data to D-SNPs and other MA plans on the Medicaid st atus of their members. W hile we appreciate the value of D-SNPs ge tting additional Medicaid co verage dat a such as Medicaid p lan en rollment, w e decline to modify the regulations to require states to do so as it is beyond the scope of this proposal. However, we continue to explore opportunities to provide plans wi th data that would assist them i n better coordinating benefits and coverage for their dually eligible enrollees. Comment: One commenter noted that the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access proposed rule does not require states to input the latest eligibility data in a specific timeframe on their claims platforms. The commenter noted that not having this clarity means that there could CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 233 be a pot ential for inconsistent data. The comment er recommended that C MS r equir e state Medicaid pr ogram s to update their claims platforms daily to assist w ith accurate dat a exchanges. Response: We a ppreciate the point the commenter is making. Our proposal did not explicitly ad dress how states incorporat e eligibility da ta with claims a nd other systems. W e will consider this recommendati on for the fut ure as we gain additional experience with daily data exchange. Comment: Two commenters stated that daily exchange of buy-in data would require significant sys tems changes and costs. O ne of these commenters recommended that C MS revise the proposal to update the frequenc y of exchange from monthly to weekly, ra ther than daily. The com menter noted that it would seldom have new informati on to send on a daily basis, but that de termini ng on a daily basis whe ther there was any new information to send would be a large effort. Finally, the commenter requested if CMS finalized the regulati on to require dai ly updates, that p rovisions be made for states whose system s cyc les are other than within a calendar day, for example, 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. Response: We appreciate the costs that t he st at e may be ar to make the system s cha nges necessary t o implement t hese provisions. We will provide t echnical assistance and opportunities for shared learning through webinars and training to support states' transition. We also note that federal matching funds at the standard rate of 50 percent for administration will reduce the states' costs. States may also be eligible for enhanced 90 percent federal matching funds for the costs of developing and implementing any necessary system changes required by regulation, and enhanced 75 percent federal matching funds for their system's maintenance and operation costs. These enhanced federal matching funds would be available for their Eligibility and Enrollment (E&E) systems (and, if necessary, their Medicaid CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 234 Management Information System (MMIS)). States would request enhanced fundi ng through the Adva nce Planning Document (APD) process. Even though there are costs to the states in implementing daily exchange of buy-in da ta, other commenters uniformly supported the value of daily exchanges in improving the experience of duall y eligible individuals, a nd in reducing burden on states, providers, and pla ns to reconcile payment. A s a result, w e decline to m ake the suggested ch ange. With respect to the poi nt that there would often not be upda tes on a daily basis, we reiterate that no file would be required on business days where there were no updates . We expect t hat states would be able to automate their systems so that they check daily for changes to buy-in status that would need to be submitted to CMS on the buy-in file, but also aut omate a process by which the system on ly ge nerates a buy -in file upon identifying s uch a change. We appreciate the additional coding required to implement this logic but expect that once implemented, no additional interventions would be needed. We will w ork w ith st at es that h ave implemented these changes to identify a nd share best pra ctices in identifying data change s to trigger daily submissions. Finall y, in response to the concer n a bout whether st ates that have an overnight processing cycle would be permitted to c ontinue doing so, we affirm that the propose d regulation would permit this. After consideration of the public comments and for the reasons articulated in the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access proposed rule and our responses to comments, we are finalizing changes to 42 CFR 406.26 and 407.40 as proposed. 3. Exchange of State MMA Data FilesCMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 235 States s ubmit data on files a t leas t monthly to C MS to id entify a ll dually eligible i an d partial- benefit dually eligible individuals (that is, those who get Medicaid hel p with Medicare premiums, and oft en for cost -sharing). The file is called the \"MMA f ile,\" but i s occasionally referred to as the \"State Phasedown f ile.\" The MMA f i le was or iginally de veloped to me et the ne e d to ti mely identify dua lly eligible indi viduals fo r the then- new M edicare Part D prescription drug benefit. T he Medicare M odernization Act (MMA) establishe d that, beginning January 1, 2006, Medicare would be primarily re sponsible for prescripti on drug coverage for ful l-benefit dually e ligibl e individuals; established auto- enrollment of full -benefit dua lly eligible ind ivi duals in to M edicare pr e scription drug plans (with regulations furthe r establishing fac ilitated e nrollment into pr escription drug pl ans fo r partial - be nefit dually e ligible individuals), p rovided that ind ividuals are treated as elig ible for the Medicare P a rt D L ow Income S ub sidy (LIS ), sometimes called E xtra H elp; defined phased down state contributions to partl y finance Part D cos ts for dually eligible individuals ; and requi red ris k-adjusting capitation payments for LIS (which include dually eligible) enrollees of Part D plans. To support these new requirements , we issued 42 CFR 423.910, e stablishing monthly reporting by states, in which states would submit , at least mont hly, a data fi le identifying dually el igible individuals in their state. Over time, we us ed these files' data o n dual eligibility s t atus to support Part C c a pitation risk-adjustment, and mos t recently, to feed dua l eligibility s ta tus to P art A a nd B e ligi bility a nd claims pr ocessing systems so providers, suppliers, and individuals have accurate information on beneficiary cost-sharing obligations. Currently, regulations require states to submit at least one MMA file each month. However, states have the option to submit multiple MMA files throughout the month (up to one CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 236 per day). Most states submit MMA data files at least weekly. In the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access proposed rule, we estimated that 37 states and D.C. would need to make a system change to send MMA data to CMS daily (84 FR 7668). Based on more recent data, we estimate that 36 states and D.C. would require such system changes. As CMS now leverages MMA data on dual eligibility status into systems supporting all four parts of the Medicare program, it is becoming even more essential that dual eligibility status is accurate and up -to-date. Dual eligibility status can change at any time in a month. Waiting up to a month for status updates can negatively impact access to the correct level of benefit at the correct level of p ayment. Based on our experience with states that exchange data daily, more frequent MMA file submissions benefit states, individuals, and providers, in a number of ways. For a full discussion of the benefits, see the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access proposed rule (84 FR 7644). As noted, current regulation requires that each state submit an MMA file at least monthly. We have implemented \"work -arounds\" for lags in dual eligibility status for Part D, including the \"Best Available Evidence\" policy (see 42 CFR 423.800(d)), as well as the Limited Income Newly Eligible Transition demonstration, which provides short term drug coverage for dually eligible individuals with no Part D plan enrollment in a given month (see Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Manual, Chapter 3, Section 40.1.4). 50 While these work -arounds provide needed protections, more frequent data exchanges would mitigate the need for them. Ensuring information on dual eligibility status is accurate and up- to-date by increasing the frequency of federal -state data exchange is an important step in the path to interoperability. 50 Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

(La st accessed June 24, 2019). CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 237 As a result, we proposed to update the frequency requirements in 42 CFR 423.910(d) to require that, starting April 1, 2022, all states submit the required MMA file data to CMS daily, and to make conforming edits to 42 CFR 423.910(b)(1). Daily would mean every business day, but that if no new transactions are available to transmit, states would not need to submit data on a given business day. We proposed requiring that states begin submitting these data daily to CMS by April 1, 2022 because we believed this applicability date would allow states to phase in any necessary operational changes or bundle them with any new systems implementation. We estimated an updated one-t ime cost for a state to be $85,000 for this MMA data systems change. For a detailed discussion of the costs associated with these requirements, we refer readers to section XVI. of the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access proposed rule (84 FR 7660 through 7673), as well as section XVI of this final rule. We sought comment on these proposals. We summarize the public comments we received on exchange of state MMA data files and provide our responses. Comment: Almost all those who commented on this provision supported the proposal to require all states to participate in daily submission of MMA file data with CMS by April 1, 2022. Commenters noted that the changes would improve the timeliness and accuracy of eligibility and enrollment data, enhance coordination of benefits, and support greater integration of care. Response: We appreciate the strong support for the proposed change to the regulation. Comment: One commenter supported the proposed change, but requested CMS consider standardizing which file types and data sets will be acceptable to support standardized daily submissions, for the overall purpose of improving the state and CMS data exchanges. Response: We understand the suggestion that we standardize which upstream data sets (for example, CMS finder files, state eligibility data) states should use to support daily MMA file CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 238 submissions. T o that end, w e will provide technical assistance to s ta tes that need to m ake cha nges to s ubmit the file da ily. As part of tha t effort, w e will wor k w ith s tates tha t already submit MMA files daily to understand and share information on best practices on the upstream data sets necessary to implement da ily MMA f ile subm issions. Comment: One commenter not ed that the proposed applicability date of April 1, 2022 will be sufficient for this change, but for overall unity i n the rule's pr oposed changes, encourage d CMS to consider al igning the effective date of this proposal with an overall extended implementation time f rame of at least 2 ye ars\u2014and ideally 5 years - f o r the remainder of the r ule's provisions. Response: We appreciate the value in aligned implementation timelines. However, given that other provisions in this rule for health plans and s tates are distinct fro m this re quirement, a nd w ill be required beginning in 2020, we continue to believe that the April 1, 2022 implementation timeline pr oposed for daily M MA f ile subm issions is appropriate. Comment: A few commente r s noted t he value of the data in t he MMA file to Med icaid managed c are organizations (MCO), Medicare dual el igible s pecial ne eds plans (D -SNPs), Health Information Exchanges, and providers for the purposes of coordinating enrollment, benefits, and/or care for dually e ligible ind ivi duals. T hese c o mmenters requested a ccess to the daily MMA file. O ne commenter no ted that some states are sharing Med icare plan enr olment data from these files with their Medi caid MC Os while also p roviding batch inquiry d ata shari ng mechanisms t o D-SNPs on Medicaid pl an enr ollment. T his commente r re commended tha t CMS encourage or require all states to follow this process at a minimum. Commenters also encouraged CMS to leverage the MMA file to support parties complying with the D-SNP integration standards recently issued in 42 CFR 422.2. CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 239 Response: We appreciate these suggestions to promote access to da ta for plans and providers serving duall y eligible individuals , and we will expl ore these ideas further for potential future conside ration. However, w e decline to modify t he regulation as suggested, as the recommended changes are beyond the scope of the proposal , which is limite d t o the frequency of the file exchange. Comment: A few commenters m a de additional suggestions for strea mlining data exc hanges. In addi tion to making t he MMA f iles accessible to plans and provi ders, so me commenters re commended a dding Medicaid pl an enrollment information t o MMA file s to c reate a single source of Med icare- M edicaid e nrollment da ta for dually e ligible individuals. Another commenter suggested a potential pathway to streamlining data exchanges would be for CMS to allow state T ransformed M edicaid S tatis tical Information System (T -MSIS) f iles to serve as the beneficiar y data source for thi rd-party appl ications. Response: We appreciate the value of streamlining data exchanges, including acce ss to a consistent data source on eligibilit y and enrollment. We als o acknowledge the overlap of certain data exchanged i n the M MA and T-MSIS file, though we note we would need to carefully explore the implications and impact s of mer ging operational data exchanges such as the MMA file - which result in changes to an i ndividual's Medicare benef it - w ith informational exchanges such as T-MSIS. W e w ill consider exploring these oppor tunities fu rther for potentia l fut ure cons ideration. However, we decline to modif y the regulation as sugge sted, as the recommended changes are beyond the scope of the proposal, which is limited to the frequency of the file exchange. Comment: Several commenters noted significant system changes and cost to update the frequency of exchanging MMA files to daily. One commenter stated that they believe HHS has CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 240 underestimated the cost to upgrade the MMA system to support daily exchange. The comment er enc ourage d CMS to provide an upda ted estimate for the costs to upgrade the system that include additional operational costs. This commenter and others encouraged CMS to consider providing additional funding to state Medicai d programs that wi ll need to upgrade their data sys tems. One commenter questioned i f CMS w ould cons ider increasing the FMAP st ates receive for interoperability a ctiv ities tha t support dua l eligible pl ans integrations and in pa rticular, for programmatic or systems changes to come into c ompliance with D-SNP integration. The commen ter noted that th is increase could exc eed exist ing enhanced m atches, f or example allowi ng the 90 percent matc h to apply for ongo ing s ystems operations that facilitate care coordination. Response : We appreciate the input on the level of effort needed to s ubmit the M MA fil e da ily. As noted elsewhere, we will provide technical assistance and opportunities for shared learning through webinars and training to support states' transiti on. We also note that fe deral match ing funds of 50 percent for administration w ill reduce t he states' costs. S tates may a lso be eligible for enhanced 90 percent federal matching funds for the costs of developing and implementing any necessary system changes required by regulation, a nd enhanc ed 75 percent federal m atching funds for their sys t em' s maintenance and o peration cos ts. These enhanced federal matching funds would be available fo r their Eligibility a nd Enrollment systems (a nd, if necessary, their Med i caid Mana gement Information System (MMIS)). S tates w ould re quest e nhanced funding through the Advance Planning Document (APD) process. As commenters did not provide specific information on the costs in excess of our assessment, we find that we have no basis to make a reasonable adjustment. As such, we are CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 241 maintaining our estimate of the number of hours r equired, as detailed in se ctions XII. and XIII. of this fin al One commenter oppos ed i ncreasi ng states submission of the MMA fil e from monthly t o daily, recommending instea d that t he frequency b e increased to weekly. The commente r stated tha t determining on a da ily ba sis w hethe r t here w as any ne w information to s end w ould be a significant effort, as multiple upstream systems may have to be changed, and further, th at there w ould seldom be new da t a to s end on a daily ba sis. T he commenter requested that if CMS finalized the regulation t o require da ily ex changes tha t states be permitted to conti nue t o existing processing cycles that cros s business , for example, run overnight betw een 6:00 p.m. t o 6:00 a.m. Response: We acknowledge the commenter's concerns about resources, but not e that other co mmenters - even those who echoed concerns about resources - u niforml y supported the value of da ily exchanges in improving the experience of dually eligible individuals and the ability of providers a nd plans to coordinate e l igibility, enrollment, be nefits, a nd/or care for this populati on. As we note above, w e are committed to providing t echnical a ssi stance and f ederal ma tching funds to support needed sy stem s changes at the state. A s a result , we decline to make the recommended change. With respect to the point that there would not be updates on a daily basis , we reiterate tha t no file would be requir ed on business days when there were no updates. W e expect that states would be able to automate their sys tems so t hat they ch eck da ily for changes to dat a that would need to be submitted to CMS on the MMA file, but also automate a process by which the system on ly generates an MMA f ile upon ide ntifying such a change. We appreciate th e additional coding required to implement this logic but that that once implemented, no additional CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 242 interventions would be needed. We will work with states that have implemente d these changes to ide ntify and share best pr actices in identifying data changes to trigger daily submissions. Finall y, in response to the concer n about st ates that have an over night proces sing cycle to continue so to meet the definition of \"daily,\" the proposed regulation would permit this. After consideration of the publ ic comments a nd for the re asons articulated in the CMS Interop erability and Patient Access proposed rule and our re sponses to comments, we are finalizing 42 CFR 423.9 10 as proposed. B. Request for Sta keholder Input In addition to the proposals discussed above, we sought public comment for consideration in pot ential future ru lemaking on how we ca n a chieve gre ater interoperability of federal- state da ta for dually e ligible individuals, i ncludi ng in the areas of progr am integrit y and car e coordination, coordination of benefits and crossover claims, beneficiary eligibility and enrollment, and their underlying data inf rastructure. F or more inf ormation on our request for comment , see the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access proposed rule (84 FR 7645) . We thank commenters for their input. W e will consider the information received for potential future rulemaking. Final Action : We will require all states to participate in daily exchange of buy-in data, which includes both sending data to CMS and receiving responses from CMS daily, and require all states submit the required MMA file data to CMS daily by April 1, 2022. These policies are being finalized in 42 CFR 406.26, 407.40, and 423.910, resp ectively, as proposed. These requirements will improve the experience of dually eligible individuals and the ability of providers and payers to coordinate eligibility, enrollment, benefits, and/or care for this population. Federal matching funds of 50 percent for ad ministration are available to support CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 243 states' costs. States may also be eligible for enhanced 90 percent federal matching funds for the costs of developing and implementing any necessary system changes required by this regulation, and enhanced 75 percent federal matching funds for their system's maintenance and operation costs. CMS will provide technical assistance to the states that need to make changes to submit their files daily, including best practices on the upstream data sets necessary to implement daily MMA file submissions. VIII. Information Blocking Background and Public Reporting Provisions, and Analysis ofand Responses to Public Comments A. Information Blocking Background 1. Legislative Background and Policy Considerations The nature and extent of information blocking has come into focus in recent years. In 2015, at the request of the Congress, ONC submitted a Report on Health Information Blocking 51 (hereinafter referred to as the \"Information Blocking Congressional Report\"), in which ONC comme nted on the then current state of technology, health IT, and health care markets. Notably, ONC observed that prevailing market conditions create incentives for some individuals and entities to exercise their control over electronic health information in wa ys that limit its availability and use. Since that time, ONC and other divisions of HHS have continued to receive feedback from patients, clinicians, health care executives, payers, app developers and other technology companies, registries and health information exchanges, professional and trade associations, and many other stakeholders regarding practices which may constitute information blocking. Despite significant public and private sector efforts to improve interoperability and 51 Office of the National Coordinator. (2015, April 9). Report to Congress on Health Information Blocking. Retrieved from https://www.healthit.gov/sites/d efault/files/reports/info_blocking_040915.pdf. CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 244 data liquidity, engageme nt with st ake holders confirm s that ad verse incentives remain a nd continue t o undermine progr ess toward a more connected health system. Based on these economic realities and first -ha nd experience working w ith the health IT industr y and stakeholders, ONC con cluded i n the Information Blocki ng C ongressional Repor t that information blocking is a serious problem and recommended that the Congress prohibit informati on blocking and provide penal ties and enforcement mechanisms to deter these harmful practices. MACRA became law in the same month that the Information Blocking Congressional Report was published. Section 106(b)(2)(A) of MACRA amended section 1848(o)(2)(A)(ii) of the Act to require that an eligible professional must demonstrate that he or she has not knowingly a nd willfully taken action (such as to disable functionality) to limit or restrict the compatib ility or interoperability of certified EHR technology, as part of being a meaningful EHR user. Section 106(b)(2)(B) of MACRA made corresponding amendments to section 1886(n)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act for eligible hospitals and, by extension, under section 1814(l)(3) of the Act for CAHs. S ections 106(b)(2)(A) and (B) of MACRA provide that the manner of this demonstration is to be through a process specified by the Secretary, such as the use of an attestation. To implement these provisions, as discussed further below, we established and codified attestation requirements to support the prevention of information blocking, which consist of three statements containing specific representations about a health care provider's implementation and use of CEHRT. T o review our discussion of these requirements, we refer readers to the CY 2017 Quality Payment Program final rule (81 FR 77028 through 77035). CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 245 and economi c research f urther u nderscores the complexity of the information blocking problem and its harmful effects. F or a full discussion of the research, s ee t he CMS Interoperability and Patient Access proposed rule (84 FR 7645 through 7646). In December 2016, s ection 4004 of the Cures Act added section 3022 of the PHSA (the \"PHSA information blocking provision\"), whic h defines conduct by health care provi ders, healt h IT developers , a nd healt h information exchanges and ne tworks that constitutes information bl ocking. The PHSA information blocking provision was enacted i n response to ongoing c oncerns that some individuals and entities are engaging in practices that unreasonably limit the availability a nd use of electronic hea lth informati on for authorized and pe rm itted purposes (see the definition of electronic health information proposed by ONC for HHS adoption at 45 CFR 171.102 (84 FR 7588) ). These practices undermine public and private sector investments in the nation's he alth IT infrastructure a nd frustr ate efforts to u se modern technologies to improve healt h care quality and efficiency, accelerate research and innovation, and provide greater value and choice to health care consumers. The information blocking provision defines and creates possible penalties and disincentives for information blocking in broad terms, working to deter the entire spectrum of practices likely to interfere with, prevent, or materially discourage access, exchange, or use of electronic health information. The PHSA information blocking provision applies to health care providers, health IT developers, exchanges, and networks. The information blocking provision also provides that the \"Secretary, through rulemaking, shall identify reasonable and necessary activities that do not constitute information blocking for purposes of the definition at section 3022(a)(1) of the PHSA.\" ONC's 21st Century Cures Act proposed rule proposed \"exceptions\" to the information blocking provision. These exceptions are reasonable and necessary activities CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 246 that w ould not constitute information blocking. In addition to the att estation discusse d in this sec tion, all health care providers woul d also be subject to the separate information blocking regulations proposed by ONC for HHS adoption at 45 CFR part 171 ( FR 7601 through Compare Physi cian Compare draws its operating authority f rom s ection 10331(a)(1) of the Affordable C are A c t. C onsisten t with section 10331(a)(2) of the Affordable Care Act, Physician Compare initiated a phased approach to publicly reporting performance scores that provide comparable information on qualit y and pati ent experience measures. A complete history of public reporting on Physician Compare is detailed i n the CY 2016 Physician Fee Schedul e (PFS) final rule with comment period (80 FR 71117 through 71122). More information about Physicia n Compare, includi ng the hi story o f public reporting a nd regular upda tes about what informati on is currentl y ava ilable, can also be access ed on the Physician C ompare Initiative website at https://www.cms.gov/medicare/quality - initiatives -patient -assessment -instruments/physician- compare- initiative/. As discussed in the CY 2018 Quality Payment Program final rule (82 FR 53820), Physician Compare has continue d to pursue a phased approach to public reporting under MACRA in accordance with secti on 1848(q)(9) of the Act. F or a discussion of public reporting on Physician C ompare, see the CMS I nteroperability and P atient Access p roposed r ul e (84 FR 7646 through 7647). Building upon the continuation of our phased approach to public reporting and understanding the importance of preventing information blocking, p romoting interoperability, and the sharing of information, we proposed to make certain data about the attestation statements on the prevention of information blocking referenced in the CMS Interoperability and Patient CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 247 Access proposed rule (84 FR 7645) available for public reporting on Physician Compare, drawing upon our authority under section 10331(a)(2) of Affordable Care Act, which required us to make publicly available on Physician Compare information on physician performance that provides comparable information for the public on quality and patient experience measures. Section 10331(a)(2) of the Affordable Care Act provided that to the extent scientifically sound measures that are developed consistent with the requirements of section 10331 of the Affordable Care Act are available, such information shall include, to the extent practicable, an assessment of the coordination of care and other information as determined appropriate by the Secretary. We noted our belief that section 10331(a)(2) of the Affordab le Care Act provided the statutory authority to publicly report certain data about the prevention of information blocking attestation statements as an assessment of care coordination and as other information determined appropriate by the Secretary. Furthermore, the prevention of information blocking attestation statements are required for a clinician to earn a Promoting Interoperability performance category score, which is then incorporated into the final score for MIPS, and we are required to publicly report both of these scores under section 1848(q)(9)(A) of the Act. Publicly posting this information as an indicator is consistent with our finalized policy to publicly report, either on the profile pages or in the downloadable database, other aspects of the Promoting Interoperability performance category, such as objectives, activities, or measures specified in the CY 2018 Quality Payment Program final rule (82 FR 53826 through 53827). We note that we finalized at 42 CFR 414.1395(b), that, with the exception of data that must be mandatorily reported on Physician Compare, for each program year, we rely on the established public reporting standards to guide the information available for inclusion on Physician Compare. The public reporting standards require data included on Physician Compare to be statistically valid, reliable, and CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 248 accurate; b e comparable across submission mechanisms; and , meet t he r eliabilit y threshold. To be incl uded on the public fa cing profile pages, the data must also resonate with website users, as det ermined by CMS. The re are three pr evention of information blocking attestation s tatements unde r 42 CFR 414.1375(b)(3)(ii)(A) through (C) to which eligible clinicians reporting on the Promoting Interoperability p erformance c ategory of MIPS must attest. To re port successfully o n the Pr omoting Interoperability performance category, in additi on to satisfying other re quirements, an eligible c linician mu st subm it an at testation response of \"yes\" for each of these s tatements. F or more informati on about these statements, w e refer r eade rs to the preamble discussion in the CY 2017 Quality Payment Program final rule (81 FR 77028 through 81 FR 77035). The Promoting Interoperability performance category weight comprises 25 percent of a MIPS eligible clinician's final score for each MIPS payment year, as specified at 42 CFR 414.1375(a). As specified at 42 CFR 414.1405(b)(2), MIPS eligible clinicians with a final score below the performance threshold receive a negative MIPS payment adjustment factor on a linear sliding scale. Certain MIPS eligible clinicians who submit data for the Promoting Interoperability performance category may be eligible for reweighting, as specified under 42 CFR 414.1380(c)(2). As specified at 42 CFR 414.1405(a), (b)(1), and (b)(2), MIPS eligible clinicians may receive a positive, neutral, or negative MIPS payment adjustment factor. As specified at 42 CFR 414.1405(c), the applicable percent for MIPS payment year 2021 is 7 percent. For MIPS payment year 2022, and each subsequent MIPS payment year, it is 9 percent. For more information about the MIPS, we refer readers to the preamble discussion in the CY 2020 Quality Payment Program final rule (84 FR 62946 through 63083). CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 249 We noted our belief that it would benefit the public to know if eligible clinicians have attested ne gatively to the statements unde r 42 CFR 414.137 5(b)(3)(i i) as thi s may a ssist pat ient in selecti ng a clinician or grou p who collaborates with other clinicians, groups , or other t ypes of health care providers by sharing information electronicall y, and does not wit hhold informati on that may result in be tter care. Therefore, we proposed to include an indicator on Physician Compare for the eligible clinicians and groups that submit a \"no\" response to any of the three stat ements unde r 42 CFR 414.1375(b)(3)(ii)(A) through (C). I n the eve nt that th ese statements are left b lank, that is, a \"yes\" or a \"no \" respons e is not subm itted, t he attestations would be considere d incomplete, and we would not include an indicator on Physician Compare. We also proposed to post this indicator on Physician Compare, either on the profile pages or the downloadable database , as feasible and a ppropriate, starti ng with the 2019 per formance period data a vailable for public reporting starting in late 2020. W e refer readers to the 2019 Promoting Interoperability Inf more information tatements. Unde r 42 CFR 414.139 5(b), these data must meet our e stablished public reporting standards, includi ng that to be incl uded on the publi c facing profile pages, t he data must r esonate with w ebsite us ers, as determined by C MS. I n previous testing with patients and caregivers, we learned tha t effective us e of CEHRT is impo rtant to them when ma king inf ormed he alth c are decisions. F or more information about previous testing w ith patients a nd caregivers, we re fer readers to the P hysician Compare T echnical Expert Panel (TEP) 03/06/20 250 to best display and meaningfully communicate the indicator on the Physician Compare website, the exact wording a nd, if applicable , pr ofile page i ndicator would be determined after user testing and shared with stakeholders through the Physician Compare Initi ative page, l istservs, webinars, and other available communication channels. We noted that the proposal was contingent upon the availability of and technical feasibility t o use the data for publi c reporting. We summarize the public comments we received on this topic and pr ovide our responses. Comment: Most commenters supported our pr oposal to publicly report an indicator on the Physician Compare website for the eligible clinicians and groups that submit a \"no\" response to any of the three prevention of information blocking attestation statements, noti ng that the indi cator would discourage clinicians and groups from information blocking and hel p Medicare pat ients and caregiver s make informed he alth c are decisions. R esponse: We tha nk commenters for their support and agree that publicly re porting an indicator on Physician Compare wil l discourage clinicians and groups from information blocking and help Medicare patients and caregivers make informed decisions. Comment: Some commenters exp ressed concer n about publicly reporti ng an indicat or on t he Physician Compare website for the eligible clinicians and groups that submit a \"no\" response to any of the three prevention of informati on blocking attestation stat ements. Several o f these commenters thought the indicator w ould be redundant, si nce there is already an incentive for c linicians to attest to the pr evention of information bl ocking statements in order to earn a MIPS Promoting Interoperability performance category score. Some commenters w ere concerned that an indicator m ay not accu rately reflec t whether a c linician or gr oup is knowingly or willfull y information blocking, since they may be confused about the attestation statements' meaning s. A few commenters suggested delaying Physician Compare's CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 251 indicator implementation in or der to give clinicians and gr oups, particularly small and rural practices, time to be come mo re familiar with t he attestations. O the r commenters expressed conc ern as to whether Medicare patients and caregivers would find the indicator useful; one of these commenters sug gested conducting a pil ot study to make such a determination. Finally, several commenters suggested a n appeal process or an oppor tunity for clinicians and groups to revi ew their information prior to publ ic reporting. Respons e: We appreciate the commenters' concerns. We b elieve publicly reporting an indicator on Physicia n Compare for the eligible clinicians and groups that submi t a \"no\" response t o any of the three pre vention of information blocking attestation statements is not redundant, a s Medicare patien ts and caregivers do not cur rently ha ve access to t his type of information, which could aid them in maki ng informed health care deci sions. Regarding concerns about clinicians, including small and rural practices , needing time to bec ome fa milia r with the attestations, w e believe there ha s b een s ufficient time for clinicians to becom e familiar w ith them, si nce these attestation st atements ha ve been a MI PS P romoting Interoperability performance category requirement since the 2017 performance period. We also believe that webinars and educ ational materials that C MS ha s made available have provided clinicians a nd gr oups an oppor tunity to be come f amiliar with the information blocking attestation statements. W e will also continue to suppor t small and rural practice s by offering free and cus tomized resources a vailable w ithin loc al communities, including direc t, one -on-one support from the Small, Underserved, and Rural Support Initiative along with our other no-cost t echnical assistance (83 FR 59720) . Regardi ng r an information blocking indicator would be me aningful to patients and caregivers, we note that unde r 42 CFR 414.139 5(b), these data must meet our established public reporting standards, including that to be posted on public facing CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 252 profile pages, the data must r esonat e with w ebsite us ers, as determined by C MS. S uch us er testing to date has shown that effective CEHRT usage is important to patients when making health care decisions. In addition, as sp ecified a t 42 C FR 414.1375(b)(3)(ii), MIPS eligible clinicians m ust attest to t he prevention of information blocking s tatements. F or more i nformation about these st atements, we refer readers to the preamble discussion in the CY 2017 Quality Payment Program final rule (81 FR 77028 through 81 FR 77035). In addition, we note that section 4004 of the Cures Act added section 3022 of the PHS A, which directs HHS to identify reasonable and necessary act ivities conducted by health care provi ders, h ealth IT developers, and hea lth information exchanges and ne tworks that would not constitute information blocking as define d in section 3022. For more information, see the information blocking discussion in ONC's 21s t Century C ures A c t fina l rule (published el sewhe re in t his issue of the Federal Regist er). While we appreciate the commenter's sugges tion to conduct a pilot study, we believe that further user testing will allow us to gain the additional unde rs tanding necessary. Regarding the comments requesti ng an opportunity to review or an appe al process, we note that, under 42 CFR 414.1395( d), for each program year, CMS provides a 30-day preview period for any clinicia n or group with Quality Payment Pr ogram data before the data are publicly reported on Physician Compare. Although at this time we do not preview indicator information, clinicians a nd groups will be able to pr eview th eir Promoting Interoperability performance ca tegory information, includi ng their attestation responses to t he three st atements during the MIPS t argeted r eview pr ocess. A ll performanc e da ta publicly r eported on Physicia n Compare will reflect the scores eligible clinicians and groups receive in their MIPS performance feedback, CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 253 which will be available for review and potential correction during the targeted review process (83 FR 59912). Comment : Many commenters r ecommende d additional act ions to prevent information blocking, beyond publicly reporting an indicator on Physicia n Compare. Some comm enters recommended imp lementing additional penalties for clinicians a nd groups that attest \"no\" to the pre vention of information bl ocking attestations, s uch a s corrective a ction. Other commenters sugge sted CMS offer more positive incentives. Several commenters suggested having additional indicators , such a positive one for those who attest \"yes.\" Another commenter recommended treating a blank response to the three attestation statements as a \"no\" response. A f ew c ommenters recommended that the proposed indicator not be used for clinicians and groups that participate in trusted exchange networks. Response: We appreciate com menters' suggestions and will consider them for potential future rulemaking, t o the extent pe rmitted by our authority. To the extent of our a uthority, we will consider treatment of attestation statements t hat are le ft blank, use of a pos itive indicator on t he Physician Compare profile pages or downloadable database, and the use of the proposed indicator for clinicians and groups that participate in truste d exchange netw orks for potential future rulemaking. Regarding commenters' suggestions for additiona l penal ties, we note that section 4004 of the Cures A ct identifies potential penalties a nd disincentives for information blocking. Health care providers de termined by the Inspector General to have committe d information blocking sha ll be re ferred to the appropr iate agency to be subject to appropriate disincentives using authorities under applicable federal law, as th e Secretary sets forth through notice and comment CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 254 rulemaking. In the ONC 21st Century Cures Act proposed rule, a request for information regarding disincentives for health care providers was included (84 FR 7553). Comment: Some commenters requested additional inf ormation on the proposed information blocking indicator. A fe w of these c om menters requested additional information on the attestation requirements for clinicians and groups participati ng in other progra ms, such as Medicar e Advantage. S everal commenters requested add it ional gui dance o n exc eptions to t he attestations. A nothe r commenter requested mor e information on the implications for clinicians and groups w ho leave the attestation st atements blank and do not attest \"yes\" or \"no. \" S everal commenters que stioned how clinicians' r espon ses to t he three attestation statement s would be ver ified f or accuracy. Response : The three attestation statements are required und er the MIPS, which is a Medicare FFS program. We note that 42 CFR 41 4.1310(b) and (c) provide that Qualifying APM Participants (QPs) and Partial QPs w ho do not report on applicable measures a nd activities tha t are require d to be reported under MI PS for any given performance period in a year ar e excluded from this d efinition at 42 CF R 414. 1305 of a MIP S eligible clinician per the statutory exclusions defined in section 1848 (q)(1)(C)(i i) and (v) of the Act. Therefore, the prevention of information blocki ng indicator would be appl icable only to MIPS eligible clinicians and groups under Medicare FFS and not to other programs, su ch as MA. U nder MI PS, t he attestation statements are required for all eligible c linicians under the Promoti ng I nteroperability perf ormance category of MIPS, as t 42 CFR 414 .1375(b)(3)(ii) (81 FR 77035) . If the attestation statements are left blank, that is, a \"yes\" or \"no\" response is not submitted, the attestations would be cons idered incomplete and the clinician or group would not receive a Promoti ng Interoperability performance category score. In this situation, we would not have an affirmative or negative CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 255 respons e to the three attestation statements from t he clinician or group, an d we would not have enough information to determine whether the clinician or group is know ingly and willfully informati on blocking. Regarding exceptions to the att estati on requirements, under 42 CFR 414.1380(c )(2) the Promoting Interoperability performance categor y may be reweighted to zero percent of the fina l sc ore for a MIPS e lig ible c linician in c ertain c ircumstances, a nd clinicians who receive reweighti ng would not have to sub mit data for the Promoting Interoperability performance category, includi ng their respons es t o the attestation statements. R egarding verification of clinicians' attestation s tatements, we n ote tha t we fina lized in pr ior rulemaking tha t we will perform ongoing monitoring of MIPS eligible clinicians and groups on an ongoing basi s for da ta validation, auditing, program integrit y issues , and instances of non-com pliance with M IPS r equirements. If a M IPS e ligible c linician or group is found to ha ve submitted i naccurate data for MIPS, w e finalized that w e would r eopen and revise the determination in accordance with the rules set forth at 42 CFR 405.980 through 405.986 (81 FR 77362). Final Action: After consideration of the comments received, and for the reasons outlined in our responses to these comments, we are finalizing this policy as proposed. Specifically, we are finalizing to include an indicator on Physician Compare for the eligible clinicians and groups that submit a \"no\" response to any of the three prevention of information blocking attestation statements for MIPS under 42 CFR 414.1375( b)(3)(ii)(A) through (C), as proposed. In the event that these statements are left blank, that is, a \"yes\" or a \"no\" response is not submitted, the attestations will be considered incomplete, and we will not include an indicator on Physician Compare. We will post this indicator on Physician Compare, either on the profile pages or in the downloadable database, as feasible and appropriate, starting with the 2019 performance period data available for public reporting starting in late 2020. CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 256 C. Public Reporting and Prevention of Information Blocking for Eligible Hospitals and Critical Access Hospitals (CAHs) Section 1886(n)(4)(B) of the Act requires the Secretary to post i n an e asily understandable format a list of the names and other r elevant d ata, as determin ed appropriate by the Secretary, of eligible hos pitals and C AHs who ar e meaningful EHR us er s under t he Medicare FFS program, on a CMS website. In addition, t hat section requires the Secretary to ens ure that an eli gible hospital or CAH has the opport unity t o review the other r elev ant da ta that a re to be made public with respect to the eligible hospital or CAH prior to such data being made public. W e noted i n the CMS Interoperability and Patient Acc ess proposed rule (84 FR 7647) that we believed certain infor mation related to the prevention of information blocking attestation statements under 42 CFR 495.40( b)(2)(i)(I)( 1) through ( 3) would constitute other relevant data under section 1886( n)(4)(B) of the Act. Specifically, we referred to the three prevention of i nformati on blocking attestation statements unde r 42 CF R 495.40(b)(2)(i)(I)( 1) through ( 3) to whic h eligible hos pitals and CAHs must attest for purposes of the Promoting Inte roperability Progr am. As part of successfully demonstrati ng that an eligible hos pit al or CAH is a me aningful EH R user for purposes o f the Promoting Inte roperability P rogram, the el igible hos pita l or CAH must sub mit an attestation r esponse of \"ye s\" for each of these statements. For more information about these statements, w e refe rred readers to the preamble discussion in the CY 2017 Q uality Payment Program final rule (81 FR 77028 through 77035). We noted in the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access proposed rule (84 FR 7647) that we believed it would be relevant to the public to know if eligible hospitals and CAHs have attested negatively to the statements under 42 CFR 4 95.40(b)(2)(i)(I)(1) through ( 3) as it could indicate that they are knowingly and unreasonably interfering with the exchange or use of CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 257 electronic health information in ways that limit its availability and use to improve health care. As we stated in the C Y 2017 Quality Payment Progra m final rule, we believed that addressing issues related t o information blocking would require additional and more comprehensive measures (81 FR 77029) . In additi on, publicly posting this information would reinforce our commitment to focus on increase d interoperability and the appropriate exchange of health information. We proposed t o post information on a CMS website available t o the public indicating that an eligible hospita l or CAH attesting unde r the Medicare F FS Promoting Interoperability Program submitted a \"no\" response to any of the three statements unde r 42 CFR 495.40(b)(2)(i)(I)( 1) through ( 3). In the event that these statements a re left blank, that is, a \"yes\" or a \"no\" r espon se is not submitted, we proposed the attestations would be considered incomplete, and we would not post any information related to these attestation statements for that hos pital or C AH. W e proposed t o post this information starting with the attestations for the EHR re porting period in 2019, and we expected the information would be posted in late 2020. In accordance with section 1886(n)(4)(B) of the Act, we proposed to establish a process for each eligible hospital and CAH to review th e information related to their specific prevention of information blocking attestation statement s before it is publicly posted on a CMS website. Specifically, for each program year, we proposed a 30-day preview period for an eligible hospital or CAH to review this information before it is publicly posted. During the 30-day preview period, we proposed that all of the informati on that we would publicly post would be available for the eligible hospital or CAH to review, a nd we would consider making changes to the information on a case-by- case b asis (for example, i n the event the eligible hospital or CAH identifies an error, and we subsequently determine that t he information is not a ccurate). Additional i nformation on the review process CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 258 would be provided outside of the rulemaking process through the usual communication channels for the program. We summarize the public comments we receive d on this topic and provide our responses. Comment: Many commenters indicated their strong support for this proposal and suggested that w e finaliz e the proposal, as commenter s believ e it is necessary in building an interoperable health system. One commenter believes that maintaining accountability and enforcing penalties is critica l to maintaining individual health and safety. Another commenter agreed, stating that information blocking is detrimental to the health, safety, and welfare of patients. Many commenters indicated that information blocking should not be tolerated for competitive or financial reasons , further indicating that consumers and stakeholders should be made aware of those who participate in information blocki ng practices , as this transparency can prevent potentia l medica l errors a nd improve the overal l qua l ity of care. Response : We tha nk commenters for their suppo rt for the proposal. We agree with the commenters and believe that the proposed polic y would be both appropriate and effective in reinforci ng our commitment to focus on increasing interoperability a nd the appropriate exchange of health information. Knowingly or willfully preventing, avoiding, or withholding information limits interoperability and prevents the sharing of imp ortan t health information. Comment: Many commenters indicated support for the promotion of health information exchange and the prevention of information blocking, generally, but expressed several concerns about the implementation of this p roposal. A couple of commenters w ere concerned that ther e is not enough time to develop the policies and procedures needed to streamline the proposed process, and in response, suggested buildi ng in a period of non-enforcement ( a pract ice period without posting any information publicly). Several commenters expressed concern that there will CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 259 not be an opportunity t o dispute information prior to publication, and requeste d including a guarantee of the proposed 30- day preview period pr ior to the publication of certain information on a CMS website. Finally, commenters had concerns about how policies related t o information blocking and changes to the 2015 Edition of certified healt h IT proposed in ONC's 21st Century Cures Act proposed rule may impact the prevention of information blocking attestations unde r the Promoting Interoperability P rogram. R esponse : We a ppreciat e the commenters' concerns and suggestions . We are finalizing the proposal to post this informati on starting with the attestations for the EHR reporting peri od in 2019, and we are targeting for this informati on to be posted in late 2020. Although we will not have a period of non-enforcement (postponing posting of information publicly), we are building in a 30-day preview period during which any discrepancies or concerns may be addressed on a case-by- case basis prior to posting. Additional information on the preview period w i ll be provided outside of the rulemaking process through the usual communication channels for the program . With regard t o ONC's 21st Century Cures Act rule, the prevention of information blocking attestation statements unde r the Promoting Inter operability P rogra m are not affected by ONC's final rule policies and remain unchanged. Comment: A number of commenters supporte d the prevention of information blocking, but had concerns about the additional burden this proposal may add. One commenter reque sted reassuranc e that this p rocess w ill not incre ase bur den, while a few other commenter s shared concerns that this process will increase burden. Response : We a ppreciat e the commenters' concerns. As eligible hospital s and CAH s are already re quired to respond to these three attestation statements unde r the Promoting Interoperability Program, we do not believe this proposal w ould require additional r eporting CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 260 effort, or thereby increase burden. We do not believe the 30-day preview period would increase burden as it will be an opportunity for eligible hospitals and CAHs to ensure the accuracy of the informati on that will be posted publicly, shoul d they choose to take advantage of this opportunity. Comment: Many commenters stated that there should be an audit or spot check process to validat e the responses provided t o the three attestation statements. Commenters indicated concer n that those who knowingly participate in informati on blocking practices will answer 'yes' to the thr ee attestation statements simply to complete the question/answer sequenci ng in the reporting system. Further, commenters expressed concer n regarding how easy it could be for their peers to respond dishonestl y, and requested more stringent auditing practices from CMS. A numbe r of commenters r equeste d additional information on how a \"blank\" response would be treated for purposes of this proposal; one commenter believed that a \"blank\" should be considered a \"no\", and another commenter believed that a \"blank\" should simply be considered as a \" blank.\" Response : We a ppreciat e the commenters' concerns. We do not have a specific a uditing practice in place for thes e specifi c attestation statements. Instead, all eligible hospitals and CAHs are required to submit respons es to the attestation statements unde r the Promoting Interoperability P rogram a nd must respond accurately, as any eligible hospita l or C AH participating in the P romoting Interoperability Progra m may be subjec t to an audit. In the event that an eligible hos pital or CAH leave s a \"blank\" respons e to an attestation statement, wher e a \"yes\" or a \"no\" response is not submitted, the response would be considered incomplete , and no information would be posted related to these attestation statements at this time. CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 261 Comment: Many commenters supporte d the effort to prevent information blocking, though several believe d that posting certain information on a CMS website of those who attest 'no' to the prevention of informati on blocking statements may not strongly impact the issue. Of the reasons given, one commenter remaine d agnostic on whether such a policy woul d have tangible success in deterring information blocking, severa l commenters stated that the informati on posted on a CMS website will have little meaning to consumers, and others believed that this process would not promote interoperability nor would it improve patien t access to information. Response : We a ppreciat e all of the commenters' concerns. As discussed in the CY 2017 Quality Payment Program Final Rule (81 FR 77029), the act of information blocki ng is a systemi c problem that Congr ess ha s expressed concerns about. Growing evidenc e has established that there is a strong incentive for health care providers to unreasonably interfere w ith the exchange of healt h information. We believe that publicly posting certain informati on on a CMS website is one valuable tool in our continued effort to deter these information bl ocking practices. As patients gain access to m ore da ta, t hey becom e more empowered and more informed decision makers. Knowing if a phys ician may be informati on blocking could influence their decision to see that phys ician. I n addition, knowing pa tients can see this information may deter phys icians from engaging in this behavior. For these reasons , we do believe that this effort will have an impact and be meaningful to consumers . We do als o believe that this policy will promote interope rability a nd improve patien t access to information. With patients becoming more empowered, this drives health care providers to move toward information sharing r ather than information blocking, which directly leads to improved patient access to information. CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 262 Comment : A couple commenters s uggested moving away from pos ting public information, and instea d focusing on creating positive incentive programs, enhanci ng guidance, providi ng more education, and fostering change through encouragi ng the prevention of informati on blocking. Some commenters agreed with the approach, but believed CMS could develop more concrete measures that would have a stronger justificati on for posting information on a CMS websit e versus using the three attestation statements. Response : Thank you for these comments and suggestions. To the extent that the commenters are requesting that w e create positive incentive program s that include incentive payments to eligible hospitals and CAHs, we note that we can only do so to the extent authorized by law. We will take into consideration the suggestions for enhancing prevention of information blocking guidance, providing more educati on, and fostering change through encouragement in potential future rulemaking. Comment : A few commenters were in favor of posting certain information on eligible hospitals and/or CAHs that provide a \"no\" response to the prevention of informati on blocking attestation statements, but have requested additional way s to discour ag e this pr actice. Commenters requested that those who are know ingly and willfully blocking the transfer of informati on also be fined, per instance or per patient, as a way of disincentivizing this practice. A couple commenters suggested strengtheni ng this provisi on by establishing an eas y way for stakeholders to report potential information blocking activities. Response: We appreciate the commenters' suggestions regarding additional ways to discourage informati on blocking. We refer commenters to section 3022(b)(2)(B) of the PHSA, which provides that any health care p rovide r determined by the Office of the Ins pector General (OIG) to have committed information blocking shall be referred to the appropriate agency to be CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 263 subject to appropriat e disincentive s using authorities unde r applicable federal law, as the Secretary sets forth through notice and comment rulemaking. Health care providers would also be subject to the separate information blocking regulations proposed by ONC for HHS adoption at 45 CFR part 171 ( 84 FR 7601 through 7605). Further, we note that ONC's 21st Century Cures Act proposed rule included a request for information regarding disincentives for health care providers (84 FR 7553) . Commen t: Many commenters, while in agreement with publicly posting certain information related to inf ormation blocking, had concerns that eligible hospitals and CAHs are being hel d accountable for the practices of health IT vendors . Many commenters were concerned that vendors are restricting the transfer of da ta by data embargoing, actively blocking, and refusing or prohibiti ng the transfer of data. Further, there were concerns that vendors are requiring complex programs, the purchase of many costly programs, and requiring excessive fees to conduct data t ransfer. Last, several commenter s requested that vendor s be penalized equally, and in the same manner, as eligibl e hospital s and CAHs. Response : We a ppreciat e the commenters' support for the proposal, and we also appreciate their concerns. We emphasize that the information blocking provisi on (section 4004 of the Cures Act) appl ies to he alth IT developers of certified health IT. Section 3022(a)(1) of the PHSA, in defining information blocking, r efers to four classes of individuals and e ntities that may e ngage in information blocking and which include: health c are providers, h ealth IT developers of c ertified health IT, networks, a nd exchanges. In the ONC 21s t Century Cures A ct proposed rule, ONC pr oposed to adopt definitions of these terms t o provide clarity regarding the types of individuals and e ntities to whom the information blocking provision a pplies ( 84 FR 760 1 through 7602). CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 264 Regarding penalties, section 4004 of the Cures Act identifies potential penalties and disincentives for information blocking. Health IT developers, health information networks, and healt h information exchanges that the Inspector General, following an investigation, determines to have committed information blocking shall be subject to a civil monetary penalty determined by the Secretary for all s uch violations identified through such investigation, which may not exceed $1,000,000 per violation. Such determination shall take into account factors such as the nature and extent of the informati on blocking and harm resulting from such information blocki ng, including, where applicable, the numbe r of pa tients affected, the numbe r of p roviders affected, and the number of da ys the information blocking persiste d. Health care providers determined by the Inspector General to have committe d information blocking shall be referred to the appropriate agenc y to be subject to appropriate disincentives using authorities under applicable Federal law, as the Secretary sets forth through notice and comment rulemaking Comment: One commenter suggested a collaboration between CMS, ONC, and OIG in order to address information blocking together, to combat information blocking consistently and from all angles. Response: We appreciate the commenter's suggesti on, and note that CMS, O NC, and OIG are consistently working together on issues such as information blocking so that our policies are complementary and work together to address the issue. Final Action : After consideration of the comments received, and for the reasons outlined in our response to these comments and in the CMS Interoperabilit y and Patient Access proposed rule, w e are finalizing this policy as proposed. We will include information on a CMS website available t o the public indicating that an eligible hospital or CAH attesting under the Medicare FFS Promoting Interoperability Program submitted a \"no\" response to any of the three CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 265 prevention of information blocking a ttestation statements unde r 42 CFR 495.40(b)(2)(i)(I)(1 ) through ( 3). We will po st this information starting with the attestations for the EHR reporting pe riod in 2019, and expect the information will be posted in late 2020. In the event that an eligible hos pital or CAH leave s a \"blank\" respons e to an attestation statement, wher e a \"yes\" or a \"no\" respon se is not s ubmitted, the attestations will be considered incomplete, and no information will be posted related to these attestation statements. We w ill establish a process f or each eligible hos pita l and CAH to review the information related to their spe cific prevention of informati on blocking attestation statements before it is publicly posted on the CMS website. For each program year, we will have a 30-day preview period for an eligible hospital or CAH to review this i nformation before it is p ublicly posted. During the 30-day preview period, all of the information that we will publicly post will b e available for the eligible hospita l or C AH to review, a nd we will consider maki ng changes to the information on a case-by- case basis. IX. Provider D igita l Contact Information Provisions, and Analysis of and Responses to Public Comments A. Background Congress required the Secretary to c reate a provide r digital contac t information index in section 4003 of the Cures Act. This index must include all individual health care providers and health care facilities, or practices, in order to facilitat e a com prehensiv e and open exchange of patient health information. Congress gave the Secretary the authority to use an existing index or to facilitate the creation of a new index. In comments received on the FY 2019 IPPS proposed rule RFI, there was strong suppor t for a single, public d irectory of provide r dig ital contact information. Commenters noted that digital communication could improve interoperability by CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 266 facilitating efficient e xchange of patient records, eliminating the burden of working with scanned paper documents, and ultimately enhancing care coordination. To ensure the index is accessible to all clinicians and facilities, we updated the National Plan and Provider Enumeration System (NPPES)52 to be able to capture digital contact information for both individuals and facilities. It is important to note that the aforementioned updates to the NPPES entailed the addition of two additional data fields. However, due to an administrative oversight, t he data elements which allow for the digital capture of contact information are not OMB approved. CMS acknowledges this violation of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA) and is currently working to remediate the issue by creating a new PRA package and thereby come into compliance with the PRA. Prior to its submission for OMB approval, the new information collection request will be made available for public review and comment as required by the PRA. NPPES currently supplies National Provider Identifier (NPI) numbers to health care providers (both individuals and facilities), maintains their NPI record, and publishes the records online. The Secretary adopted the NPI as the HIPAA administrative simplification standard identifier for health care providers (69 FR 3434). HIPAA covered entities, including health care providers, health plans, and health care clearinghouses, must use the NPI in HIPAA transactions. All health care providers that transmit health information in electronic form in connection with a HIPAA transaction must obtain an NPI. Health care providers are required to communicate to the NPPES any information that has changed within 30 days of the change (45 CFR 162.410(a)(4)). We review NPPES to ensure bsite at https://nppes.cms.hhs.gov/. CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 267 a provider h as a va lid NPI as pa rt of the Medicar e enrollment proc ess, as well as the revalidation process, which occurs every 3 to 5 years depending on the provider or supplier type. Informati on in NPPES is publicly accessible via both an online search option and a downloadable database option. As a result, adding di gita l contac t information to this existing index is an efficien t and effective way to meet the Congressiona l requirement to establish a digital contact information index and to promote the sharing of information. As of June 2018, NPPES has been updated t o include the capability to capture one or more p ieces of digital contact information that can be used to f acilitat e secure s haring of health information. For instance, providers can submit a Direct address, which functions similar to a regula r e-mail address, but includ es additional security measur es to ensur e that messag es are only accessible to the intended recipient in order to keep the informati on confidential and secure. \"Direct\" is a technica l standard for exc hanging health informa tion. Direct addresse s are available from a variety of sources, includi ng EHR vendors, State Health Information Exchange entities, regiona l and local Health Information Exchange entities, as well as private service pr oviders offering Direct exchang e capabi lities Service Providers (HISPs) (https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/directbasicsforprovidersqa_05092014.pdf ). NPPES can als o capture information about a wide range of other types of endpoints that providers can use to facilitate secure exchange of healt h information, for instanc e a FHIR server URL or query endpoint associated with a health information exchange. We strongl y encourage the inclusion of this FHIR e ndpoint information in NPPES in suppo rt of the Patien t Access API policy discussed in s ection III. of this final rule and the Provider Directory API policy discussed in section IV. of this final rule. Using NPPES as one w ay to make these endpoints publicly know n will significantly support interoperability throughout the health care system. CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 268 In additi on, NPPES can now maintain information about the type of contact information provider s and organizations are associated with, along with the preferred uses for each address. Each provider in NPPES can maintain their own unique information or associate themselves with informati on shared among a group of providers. Finall y, in March 2019, NPPES added a public API which can be used to obtai n the digital contact information store d in the database. Although NPPES is now bette r equipped to maintain provide r digital contac t information, many providers have not submitted this informati on. In the 2015 final rule, \"Medicare and Medicai d Programs; Electroni c Health Record Incentive Program -Stage 3 and Modifications t o Meaningful Use in 2015 Through 2017\" (80 FR 62901) , we finalized a policy to collec t information in NPPES about the electroni c addresses of participant s in the EHR I ncentive Program (specifically, a Direct addre ss and/or other \"electroni c service information\" as available). However, this pol icy was not fully implemented at the time, in part due to the limitations of the NPPES syste m which ha ve since been addressed. As a result, many provider s have not yet added their digital contact information to N PPES and digita l contac t information is frequently out of date. In light of these upda tes to the NPPES system, all individual health care providers and facilities can take immediate action to updat e their NPPES record online to add digi tal contact information. This simple step w ill significantly improve interoperability by ma king valuabl e contact information easily accessible. For those providers who continue t o rely on the use of cumbersome, fax-base d modes of sharing information, we hope that greater availability of digital contac t information will help to reduce barriers to electronic communication with a wide r set of providers with whom they share patients. Ubiquitous, public availability of digital contact information for all providers is a crucial step towards eliminating the use of fax machines for the CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 269 exchange of healt h information. We urged all providers to take advantag e of this resour ce to implemen t Congress ' requirement that the Secretary establish a digita l contac t information index. B . Public Reporting of Missing Digita l Contac t Information Entiti es seeking to engag e in electronic he alth information exchange need accurate information about the electroni c addresses ( for example, Direct address, FHIR ser ver URL, query endpoint, or other digital contact information) of pot ential exchange partners . A common directory of the elect ronic addresses of health care providers and organizations coul d enhance interoperability a nd information exchange by providing a resource where users can obtain informati on about how to securely transmit electronic health informati on to a provider. We pr oposed to increase the number of providers with valid and current digital contact informati on available through NPPES by publicly reporting the names and NPIs of those providers who do not yet have their digital contact information include d in the NPPES system. We proposed to begi n this public reporti ng in the second half of 2020, to allow individuals and facilities time to review their records in NPPES and update the syste m with appropriate digital contact information. We also requested comment from stakeh olders on the most appropriate way to pursue this public reporti ng initiative, including where these names should be posted, with what frequency, and any other information stakeholders believed would be helpful. We not ed that w e believed this information would be extremely valuable to facilitate interoperability, and we appreciated Congress' leadershi p in requiri ng the establishment of this directory. We requested stakeholde r commen t on additiona l possible enforcement authorities to ensure that individuals and facilities make their digital contac t information publicly available through NPPES. For example, we questioned if Medicare reporting programs, such as MIPS, should require eligible clinicians to update their NPPES data with their d igital c ontact CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 270 information? Should CMS require this information to be included as part of the Medicare enrollment and revalidation process? How can CMS work with states to promote adding informati on to the directory thr ough state Medicaid programs and CHIP? Should CMS require providers to s ubm it digital contac t information as part of p rogra m integrity pr ocesses related to prior authorizati on and submission of medical record documentation? We noted that we would review comments for possible consideration i n future rulemaking on these questions. We summarize the public comments we receive d on this topic and provide our responses. Comment: Many stakeholders shared our goal of improving the accuracy and completeness of data in the NPPES. Response : We thank commenters for their suppo rt and are finalizing this policy as proposed. Comment: Many commenters, while supporti ng the ultimate goal of the proposal, noted doubts about whether the proposal would be effective at increasi ng the accurac y and completeness of digital contac t informat ion in NPPES. Commenters believed that a public reporting mechanism would not serve as a meaningful deterrent to providers leaving their information blank. One commente r stated that they believed, even with the implementation of this proposal, high rates of inaccuracies would persist in NPPES, and stakeholders would continue to r ely on interna l sources of information. Severa l commenters stated that, given the like lihood that this proposa l would not result in meaningfu l improvements, this proposa l would represent unnecessary administrative burden for providers. Response : We thank commenters for their feedback on the potentia l effectiveness of this proposal. While we believe that this proposa l is an important initia l step t oward increasing the accuracy of information in NPPES, we appreciate that this proposal may not be sufficient to fully CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 271 realize the goal of NPPES serving as a comprehensive index of provider digital contact information. To this end, we requested comment on other programs that CMS could leverage to improve the completeness and accuracy of informati on in NPPES. The responses to this commen t solicitation are discussed in more detai l below. Comment: Many commenters recommende d that, instead of pursuing a policy based on \"public shaming,\" it would be more effective for C MS to conside r incentive -based policie s for updating their dig ita l contac t information in NPPES. Response : We thank commenters for their recommendations. While we believe the proposed polic y is an important step toward increasing th e completene ss and accuracy of informati on in NPPES , we believe that other policy initiatives using incentives may be effective as well, such as leveraging opportunities unde r the MIPS program, and we will consider these approaches for potential inclusi on in future rulemaking. Comment: In the proposed rule, CMS requeste d comment on additional possible enforcement authoriti es to ensure that individual s and facilitie s make their digital contact informati on publicly available through NPPES . Many commenters supporte d the use of other authoriti es to incre ase th e accuracy and completene ss of digital contact information in NPPES, stating that they believe these authoriti es were mor e likely to be effectiv e than the proposed policy for publicly reporting the names and NPIs of those providers that have not included digital contact information in NPPES. For instance, many commenters believed that including this requirement in the MIPS program would be a more effective strategy for achievi ng the goals of the policy. Com menters believed this would be more effective due to the incentives available through the MIPS program. Commenters also believed tha t use of the MIPS program w ould be more effective since the CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 272 Promoting Interoperability categor y of MIPS already includes requirements to electronically exchange health information, a nd the goal of increasing availability of digital contact informati on would ali gn with those features of the program . Commenters also believed that tying this policy to the MIPS program would hel p to ensure annual upda tes of digital contact informati on as part of required MIPS data submissions. Several commenter s also supported the use o f the Medicar e enrollment or r evalidation process and the use of program integrity processes as ways to promote updating of digital contact informati on in NPPES. Response : We thank commenters for their input on additiona l enforcement mechanisms. We will take these comments unde r consideration as we conside r potential future rulemaking or operational change s to these pr ograms that are consisten t with each program's s tatutory a uthority. Comment: Many commenters suggested that CMS provide additional educati on and guidance about the benefits of adding their digital contact information t o NPPES. These commenters recommended that CMS engage in publi c education as a necessary step before proceedi ng with public reporting in order to build awareness among providers of the importance of upda ting this information. For instance, one commenter noted that many hospital- based physicia ns are not aware of their dig ital contac t information, currently re lying on their ins titution's informatics division to manage this data. O thers s uggested that providers are not aware of the new functionality in NPPES allowing for submission of digital contac t information and that education will b e needed to familiari ze provider s with this f eature. Commenters recommended that public education initiatives be targeted at those providers least likely to be familiar with the new functionality, and that CMS should work with specialty societies and other CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 273 provider representative s to ensure education reache s a w ide variety of providers. Some commenters also stated that a publ ic education initiativ e alone would be a more appropriate alternative t o public reporting of providers' names and NPIs. Response: We appreciate commenters' recommendations around the need for public education. Since upda ting the functionality in NPPES starting in 2018, we have taken steps to familiarize the provide r community with these updates and plan to continue and expand this outreach. We agree that education effort s will be important to ensure that provider s are aware of their responsibilities and that they may be at risk of having their names and NPIs publicly reported if they do not update their digital contac t information in NPPES in a timely ma nner. While recognizing the importanc e of publi c edu cation, we also believe that mor e aggressive steps are needed to accelerat e the accuracy of completene ss of information within NPPES, therefore we are finalizing the policy to publicly report the names and NPIs of providers that do not include digita l contac t information in NPPES. Comment: CMS proposed to begi n public reporting i n the second half of 2020. A number of commenters suggested that CMS delay this timeframe to allow providers more time to be made aware of the policy, review their NPPES record, and add missing information. One commente r believed that this timeline was not consisten t with the time that would be required for CMS to reach small providers with informati on about the new policy, and recommended a delay of at least an additional 12 months before public reporting begins. Response : We a ppreciat e commenters' concern s and suggestions regarding the appropriate timeframe for publ i c reporting under this proposal. However, we believe that the proposed timeline allows sufficien t time for outreach and education to make providers aware o f the requirement. We are therefore finalizing this timeframe as proposed. CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 274 Comment : Many commenters expressed concerns about the accuracy of informati on in NPPES, stating that inaccurate information imposes a bur den on both providers and consumers who may try to collect and use this informati on only to fi nd out that it is incorrect. These commenters noted inac curate contac t information a lso poses a proble m for providers who are concerned with sendi ng protected healt h information t o the wrong recipient. One commenter stated that th ese c halleng es rai se que stions about whether a p ublic file is appropriat e to serve as the basis for increasi ng interoperability across provider systems. Commenters suggested steps CMS could take to improve the accuracy of informati on in NPPES. One commenter suggested that CMS establish a requirement that provider s update their information within a set time period. Another commenter suggeste d that NPPES post the date that information associated with a given NPI was last updated so that individuals reviewing the databas e could asses s its accuracy. Several commenter s urged C MS to conduct direct outreach to pr oviders to c onfir m their information, or to validate provide r information with other sources, suc h as state licensing boards, in order to increase accuracy. Response : We a ppreciat e commenters' concern s about the accuracy of provider cont act informati on within NPPES. The \"Last Updated\" date is posted on the \"NPI View\" page for records in th e public NPPES NPI Registry. It should also be noted that providers a re required to update information included in NPPES within 30 days of a change (45 CFR 162.410( a)(4)). However, we unde rstand from commenters that in practice these upda tes often do not occur, contributing to historical challenges with the accuracy of NPPES data. We a ppreciat e commenters' suggestions for ways to improv e the accuracy of data within NPPES, and we w ill take t hese s uggestions into consideration. CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 275 Comment: Several commenters noted that providers who have not participate d in the Promoting Interoperability P rogra m (formerly the EHR Incentive Programs ) are more likely to not have digital contact informati on available than those that have participated a nd received incentives for adopti on of health information. Commenters state d that these providers would be at a disadvantage unde r the proposed policy, and that identifying these provider s as noncompliant through a public reporting mechanism would be unfair. Commenters stated that this group likely inc ludes smalle r practices, rural clinicians, hospital- based clinicians, and clinician s employed at a variety of settings which were not eligible for EHR incentives, such as rehabilitation centers. Response : We a ppreciat e commenters' concern s regarding those clinicians that are less likely to ha ve existing digita l contact information. While we understand that it m ay take more time for these clinicians to obtain a nd subm it digital contac t information to NPPES, we believe that the timeframe for implementing this proposa l will pr ovide sufficien t notice to clinicians. We also be lieve that obtaining di gita l contac t information, s uch a s a Direc t address, is now widely available t o clinicians, includi ng those who do not have certified EHR systems. Accordingly, we believe that these providers will be able to obtain digita l contac t information and add it to their NPPES record with relatively minima l burden. Comment : Many commenters suggested that CMS establish a process f or offering providers a chance to review their information and correc t any issues prior to the implementation of public reporting. Commenters stated that CMS should issue communicati on to providers informing them of the status of their digita l contac t information, and that communications should include mechanisms which allow the provider to make corrections. One commenter CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 276 recommended that CMS institut e a 6 0-day review period prior to public reporting similar to the review period established for data included on the Physicia n Compare website. Response: We a ppreciat e commenters' suggestions r egarding opportuniti es for clinicians to review their inf ormation prior to the implementation of this public reporting policy. We have already implemented multiple methods for providers to review their information allowing them to corr ect any issue s with their NPPES record. Provider s can review their information using the NPPES NP I Registry (ht tps://np iregistry.cms.hhs.gov/), the NPPES NPI Registry API (https://npiregistry.cms.hhs.gov/registry/help- api), NPPES Data Dissemination file (https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and- Guidance/Administrative - Simplification/NationalProvIdentStand/DataDissemination ). Each source currently contains all the information that will a llow providers to determine the correctness of their information. As discusse d above, we will also engage in continued public educati on efforts to ensure providers are aware of the benefits of including digita l contac t information in NPPES, as well as the associated public reporting policy. Comment : Several commenters requested additional information about what kind of digita l contac t information would satisfy this requirement. One commente r recommended that providers should be able to specify other digital endpoints besides a Direct address. Another commente r requested clarity on whethe r the digita l fax numbers would qualify as digita l contact information. Response: As discussed in the proposed rule, NPPES is able to capture a variety of differen t dig ita l endpoints. A digita l fax numbe r is not considered a digita l endpoin t for the purposes of this proposal. For more informati on on the digital contact information which can be added to NPPES, see CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 277 https://nppes.cms.hhs.gov/webhelp/nppeshelp/HEALTH%20INFORMATION%20EXCHANGE .html. Comment : Severa l commenters recommended that CMS partne r with other centralized a uthorities that collec t provide r information. Commenters stated that relying on providers alone to update their information will not p rovide the levels of accuracy necessary for other providers to ut ilize NPPES for routine exchange of electronic health information. Commenters noted tha t today, directory services that employ appropriate identify proofing proces ses and other means for e nsuri ng records are up-to-date are much more likely to posses s accurate information than NPPES, and CMS should seek t o improve the quality of NPPES by working with these partners. Commenters believed that by working with these entities, CMS could greatly reduce provider burden associated with entering information int o and updating information in NPPES. Response : We appreciate commenters ' input regarding other strategies to improve the accuracy of the digita l contac t information within N PPES. Comment: Several commenters requested additional guidance on how the public reporting mechanism would operate. One commenter sought information on where the names would be publicly reported. Another commenter questioned how CMS would address publ ic reporting of providers that have an NPI but do not have active practice locations where they are providing services under Medicare or engaging in communication with patients. Response : We thank commenters for these questions. Following the publication of the final rule, w e will release additiona l information around the public reporting mechanism including where we intend to publish the names and NPIs of providers that do not have digital contac t information in NPPES, as well as information abou t whethe r certain providers would be exempt from p ublic reporting. CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 278 Comment: One commenter questioned how providers would be expected to know their digita l contac t information as this information may not be vi sible to providers in many EHR sys tems. Response : We e ncourage providers, especiall y clinicians, to work with healt h IT administrators in th eir organization or directly with their health IT vendor if they a re unclea r on where their digital contact information can be found. We also note that NPPES now provides for bulk uploading of informati on to multiple NPI records, and encourage clinicians to work with health IT administrators in their org anization to develop streamlined processes for updating this information in a way that imposes minima l burden on clinician s. Comment: Several commenters noted the Provider Enrollment, Chain, and Ownership Syste m (PECOS ) system would be the most appropriate location for storing digita l contact information. Response : While w e understand the interest in using PECOS as the locat ion for storing digita l contac t information, w e are not considering this as an option at this time. PECOS collects informati on specific to provider a nd supplier enrollment in the Medicare program and the system is limited t o the fields on the CMS 855 Enrol lmen t forms. A ny other data outside of this is optional. There are also many operational and systematic issues that prevent PECOS from being utilized to implement the digita l contac t information requirement. Comment : Several commenters r aised questions about what entiti es would have access to the information in NPPES. One commenter stated that any entity shoul d be able to gain access to NPPES in order to advance interoperability. Another noted that making digital endpoints publicly accessible via an API that may be ac cessible to third parties could pose a risk to the security of protected health information available through those APIs, and recommended that CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 279 CMS make this information available to other entities only if the third -party entity requests access from the API owner. Response: NPPES already furnishes a public downloadable data dissemination file as well as a public API that provides the public information a vailable in the NPI Registry. Both files are pub licly accessible. Please note that this proposal is not related to the Patient Access API discussed in section III. of this final rule that can include patien t protected health i nformation. Comment : A numbe r of commenters requested additiona l information on issues related to NPPES functionalit y, and sought guidance on how to enter digital contact information. For instance, numerous commenters believed that the NPPES does not allow for a provider to enter information for multiple practice and billing locations. Several commenters sought information about whethe r a provider could enter multiple digita l endpoints, for instance if they e mploy differen t en dpoints for differen t types of communication. One commente r requested information on whether a provider could enter digital contact information for his or her employer, ra the r than individua l information. Response : For more information on h ow information is captured in NPPES, w e encourage commenters to review information available on the NPPES website at https://nppes.cms.hhs.gov/webhelp/nppeshelp/HEALTH%20 INFORMATION%20EXCHANGE .html. Comment : Severa l commenters suggested that CMS develop a digita l contac t information interoperability s tandard for facilitating efficien t exchange of patien t records. Response : We a ppreciat e commenters' suggestions, and note that we continue to collaborate with ONC, other federal partners, and industry stakeholders, to develop more robust CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 280 provider directory standards that can support exchange of this information. We also direct commenters to the discussion of the Provider Directory API in section IV. of this final rule. Final Action : After consideration of the comments received, and for the reasons outlined in our response to these comments and in the CMS Interoperabilit y and Patient Access proposed rule, we are finalizing t o publicly report the names and NPIs of those providers who do not have digital contact information include d in the NPPES system beginning i n the second half of 2020 as proposed. Additionally, we will engage in continued public educati on effort s to ensure providers are aware of the benefits of including digita l contac t information in N PPES, including FHIR API endpoints, and when and where this informati on will be posted. X. Conditions of Par ticipation for Hosp itals and Critica l Access Hospitals (CAHs) Provi sions, and Analysis of and Responses to Public Comments A. Background As noted in the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access proposed rule (84 FR 7649 through 7653), we appreciate the pathways Congress has created for action on i nteroperability and ha ve been worki ng diligently with ONC to implement them. In order to ensure broad stakeholde r input to inform the proposals, we published a Reques t for Information (RFI) on interoperability in several propose d rules, including the FY 2019 IPPS proposed rule (83 FR 20550). Specifically, we published the RFI entitled, \"Promoting Interoperability and Electronic Healthcare Informati on Exchange Through Possible Revisions to the CMS Patient Health and Safety Requirements for Hospitals and Othe r Medicare- and Me dicaid- Participating Providers and S uppliers.\" We requested stakeholders' input on how we could use the CMS health and safet y standards that are required for providers and suppliers participating in the Medicare and Medicaid programs (that is, the Conditions of Participation (CoPs), Conditions for Coverage CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 281 (CfCs), a nd Requirements for long term care facilities) to further advance electronic exchange of information that support s safe, effective transitions of care between hospital s and community providers. Specificall y, we requested comment on revisions to the current CMS CoPs for hospitals such as: requiring that hos pitals transferring medically necessary information to a nother facility upon a patient transfer or discharge do s o electronic ally; requiring that hos pitals electronically send required discharge information to a community provider via electronic means if possible and if a community provider can be identified; and requiring that hospitals make certain information available to patients or a specified third-party application (for example, r equired discharge instructions) via electronic means if requested. The RFI discussed several steps we ha ve taken in recent year s to updat e and modernize the CoPs and other health and safet y standa rds to reflec t current best practices for clinica l care, especiall y in the area of care coordination and discharge planning. For a complete discussion of this work, see the proposed rule ( 84 FR 7649 through 7650). In the September 30, 2019 Federal Register , we published a final rule, \"Medicare and Medicaid Programs ; Re visions to Requirements for Discharge Planning\" (84 FR 51836) (\"Discharge Planning final rule\"), that revises the discharge planning requirements that hospitals (including psychiatric hospitals, long- term care hospitals, and inpatient r ehabilitation facilities), critical acce ss hos pitals (CAHs), and home health agencies, must meet to participate in Medicare a nd Medicaid programs . The rule supports CMS' interoperability efforts by promoting the exchange of patient information between health care settings , and by ensuring that a patient's necessary medica l information is transferred with the pa tient after discharge from a hospital, CAH, or post-acute care services provider. By requiring that all of the patient' s necessary medical i nformation, including his o r her p ost-d ischarge g oals of care a nd treatment preferences, CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 282 must be documente d in the patient's medical record and t ransferred along with the patien t at the time of discharge t o an appropriat e receiving health care facility, such as a PAC service pr ovider or agency, and to other outpatient service providers and practitioners responsible for the patient's follow -up or ancillar y care, t he rule aims to better prepar e patients and their caregivers to be active partners and advocates for their health care and community support needs upon discharge from the hospital or pos t-acute c are setting. While we finalized a broad requirement for sending necessary medica l information in accordan ce with all applicabl e laws, rather than listing specifi c data elements (such as t hose explicitly aligned with th e data referenced as part of the Common Clinica l Data Set (CCDS ) that was finalized in the 201 5 final rule, \"Medicare and Medicaid Programs ; Electronic H ealth Record Incentive Program\u2014Stage 3 and Modifications to Meaningful Use in 2015 Through 2017\"(80 FR 62762) , we also ensured that the revisions to the CoPs did not conflict with the CCDS, or future standards propose d for adoption for electronic exchange of health in formation, specificall y the USCDI. The discharge planning CoPs do not bar providers from sending all additiona l appropriate medica l information regarding th e patient's curren t course of illness and treatment, p ost- discharg e goa ls of care, and treatment preferenc es in accordanc e with applicable laws. However, we not e here that th e Discharg e Planning final rul e doe s not requir e hospitals, CAHs, and HHAs to transfe r the ne cessary patient medica l information exclusively by electronic means nor does it require that providers notify the appropriate providers , suppliers, and practitioners receiving the necessary me dica l information of the patie nt's discharg e as we are now requiring in this final rule. A dditionally, the Discharge Planni ng final rule further supports interoperability and a patient's access to his or her own medical records by updating the hospital Patient Rights CoP to CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 283 now state that the patien t has the right to access his or her m edica l records in the form and format requested (includi ng in an electronic form or f orma t when such medica l records are maintained electronically). Therefore, the hospital CoPs now include an explicit requirement that, as a condition of participation, hos pitals must provide patients with access to their medical recor ds in an electronic format upon the patient's request if the hospital has the capacit y to do so. In response to the RFI in the FY 2019 IPPS proposed rule , many stakeholders supported our goals of increasi ng interoperability, and acknowledged the importa nt role that hos pital settings play in supporting care coordination. Stakeholders agreed that use of electronic technology was an importan t factor in ensuring safe transitions. Multiple stakeholders emphasized that electronic da ta exchange between hospital s and physician offices, as well as with hospices, HHAs, SNFs, and other post-acute c are services pr oviders, was especially important during care transitions when maintaining access to patien t health information, including medication information, and is extremely relevant to the patient's next phase of care. Additionally, stakeholders noted that giving patients and their c aregivers access to important healt h information (such as discharge information along with accuratel y reconcile d lists of discharg e medications) created a mor e patient- centered health care system, and reduced the risk of errors and hospital readmissions . But many stakeholders also expressed concerns about implementing policy changes within the CoPs that might increase the compliance burden on hospitals. However, several stakeholders a lso strongly recommended that CMS add detail s to the CoPs, and require that hospitals share not only medically necessary information with physician offices, HHAs, and SNFs (such as pending tests and discharge summaries), but also notifications of when patients were admitted to the hospita l as well as discharged or transferred from the hospital and admitted to the c are o f applicable PAC services providers a nd suppliers. CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 284 Given responses to the RFI, as well as previ ous rulemaking activities, we sought to further expand CMS requirements for interoperability within the hospital and CAH CoPs as part of the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access proposed rule by focusing on electronic patient event notifications. In addition, we noted that we were committed to taking further steps to ensure that facilities that are electronically capturing information are electronically exchanging that information with providers who have the capacity to accept it. Infrastructure support ing the exchange of electronic health information across settings has matured substantially in recent years. Research studies have increasingly found that health information exchange interventions can affect positive outcomes in health care quality and public health, in addition to more longstanding findings around reductions in utilization and costs. A recent review of how health information exchange interventions can improve cost and quality outcomes identified a growing body of high- quality studies showing that these interventions are associated with beneficial results. 53 The authors identified a number of studies demonstrating positive effects on outcomes associated with better care coordination, such as reductions in 30 - day readmissions,54,55,56 and improved medication reconciliation.57 53 Menachemi, N., Rahurkar, S., Harle, C.

CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 285 Electronic patient event notifications from hospitals, or clinical event notifications, are one type of health information exchange intervention that has been increasingly recognized as an effective and scalable tool for improving care coordination across settings, especially for patients at discharge. This approach has been associated with a reduction in readmissions following implementation of such notifications. 58 We noted that the evidence cited in this section to support the use of innovative health information exchange interventions and approaches, such as the patient event notifications that we proposed to require, can be applied to various types of hospitals, including psychiatric hospitals, as well as to CAHs, as discussed below. Patient event notifications are automated, electronic communications from the discharging provider to another facility, or to another applicable community provider as identified by the patient (such as a patient's primary care practitio ner or practice group, post- acute care services providers and suppliers, and other practitioners and providers that need the notification for post -acute care coordination, treatment, and/or quality improvement purposes), which alerts the receiving provider that the patient has received care at a different setting. Depending on the implementation, information included with these notifications can range from conveying the patient's name, other basic demographic information, and the sending institution to a ri cher set of clinical data on the patient. Even with a minimum set of information included, these notifications can help ensure that a receiving provider, facility, or practitioner is aware that the patient has received care elsewhere. The notification trig gers a receiving provider, facility, or practitioner to reach out to the patient and deliver appropriate follow-up care in a timely manner. By notifying the individuals and entities that need notification of the patient's status for 58 Unruh, M. A., Jung, H. -Y., Kaushal, R., & Vest, J. R. (2017). Hospitalization event notific ations and reductions in readmissions of Medicare fee -for-service beneficiaries in the Bronx, New York. Journal of the American Medical coordina tion, or quality improvement purposes, the notificati on can help to improve post-discharge transitions and reduce the likelihood that a patient would face complications from inadequate follow -up care. In addition to their effectiveness in supporti ng care coordination, virtually all EHR system s generat e the basic message s commonly used to support electroni c patient event notifications. These notifications are based on admission, discharge, a nd transfer (ADT) messages, a standard message used within an EHR as the vehicle for communicating information about key change s in a patient' s statu s as they are tracked by the system (more information about the current standard supporting these messag es is a vailabl e at http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=144). As noted in the Interoperability Standards Advisor y (ISA) published by ONC, this messaging standard has been widely adopted acros s the health care system discharge-andor- s provide each patient' s personal or demographic information (such as the patient's name, insurance, next of kin, and attending physician), when that information has been updated, and also indicat e when an ADT status has changed. To creat e an e lectroni c patient event notification, a system can use the change in ADT statu s to trigger a message to a receiving provider or to a health informati on exchange system that can then route the message to the appropriate provider . In addition to the basic demographic informati on contained in the ADT message, some patient event notification implementations attach more detailed information to the message regarding the patient' s clinical status and care r eceived from the sending provider. B. Provisions for Hospitals (42 CFR 482.24(d))CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 287 We pr oposed to revise the CoPs for Medicare- and Medicaid-participating hospitals at 42 CFR 482.24 by adding a new standard at paragraph (d), \"Electronic Notifications,\" that would require hospitals to send electronic patien t event notifications of a patient's admission, discharge, and/or transfe r to another health care facility or to anothe r community provide r or p ractitioner. W e proposed to require hospitals to convey, at a minimum , the patient's basic personal or demographic information, as well as the name of the sending institution (that is, the hospital), and, if not prohibited by other applicable law, the patient's diagnosis. In proposing that patient event notifications sent by a hospital's medical records system include diagnosis, where not prohibited by other applicable law, we requested commen t on the technica l feasibility of this proposal, noting that we recognize some existing ADT messages might not include diagnosis, as well as the challeng es in appropriately segmenting this information in instances where the diagnosis may not be permitte d for disclosure under other applicable laws. We also encouraged hospitals, as their systems and those of the receiving providers allowed, t o work with pa tients and their practitioners to offer more robus t patient information and clinical data upon request in accordance with applicable law. For a hos pital that currently possess es an EHR system with the capacity to generat e the basic patient personal or demographic information for electronic patient event notifications, we proposed that complian ce with the proposed standard within the Medical records servi ces C oP (42 CFR 482.24) would be determined by the hospital demonstrati ng to the surveyor or accrediting organization that its syste m: (1) is fully operationa l and that it ope rates in accordan ce with all state and federal statut es and regulations regarding the exchange of patient healt h information; (2) utilizes the content exchange standard incorporated by referen ce at 45 CFR 170.205(a)(4)(i); ( 3) sends notifications that would have to include the minimu m patient CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 288 health information (which, as noted above, would be the patient's name, treating practitioner name, sending institution name, and, if not prohibited by other applicable law, patient diagnosis); and 4) sends notifications directly, or through an intermediary that facilitates exchange of health information, and at the time of the patient's admission to the hospital and either immediately prior to or at the time of the patient's discharge and/or transfer from the hospital. We proposed to limit this requirement to only those hospitals which currently possess EHR systems with the technical capacity to generate information for electronic patient event notifications as discussed below, recognizing that not all Medicare- and Medicaid -participating hospitals have been eligible for past programs promoting adoption of EHR systems. We noted our goal in proposing the requirement was to ensure that hospital EHR s ystems have a basic capacity to generate messages that can be utilized for notifications by a wide range of receiving providers, enabled by common standards. We believed that a system that utilizes the ADT messaging standard, which is widely used as the ba sis for implementing these notifications and other similar use cases, would meet this goal by supporting the availability of information that can be used to generate information for patient event notifications. Specifically, we proposed that the system utilize the ADT messaging standard incorporated by reference at 45 CFR 170.205 (a)(4)(i).59 We n oted that, while there are no criteria under the ONC Health IT Certification Program which certifies health IT to create and send electronic patient event notifica tions, the ADT standard is referenced by other certification criteria under the program. Specifically, this standard supports certification criteria related to transferring information to immunization registries, as 59 Healt h Level Seven Messaging Standard Versio n 2.5.1 (HL7 2.5.1 ), an Applicatio n Protocol for Electronic Data Exchange in Healthcare Environments, February 21, 2007 . CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 289 well as transmission of laboratory results to public health agencies as described at 45 CFR 170.315(f) under the 2015 Edition certification criteria, and at 45 CFR 170.314(f) under the 2014 Edition. Thus, we expect systems that include Health IT Modules certified to meet criteria which reference this standard will possess the basic capacity to generate information for notification messages. We further noted that adopting certified health IT that meets these criteria has been required for any hospital seeking to qualify for the Promoting Interoper ability Programs (formerly the EHR Incentive Programs). We recognized that there is currently significant variation in how hospitals have utilized the ADT messages to support implementation of patient event notifications. We also recognized that many hospitals, which have already implemented notifications, may be delivering additional information beyond the basic information included in the ADT message (both automatically when a patient's status changes and then upon request from receiving providers) to receiving practitioners, patient care team members, and post -acute care services providers and suppliers with whom they have established patient care relationships and agreements for patient health information exchange as allowed by law. We believe consensus standards for ADT- based notifications may become more widely adopted in the future (we refer readers to ONC's ISA 60 for more information about standards under consideration). However, at this time, we stated that we did not wish to restrict hospitals from pursuing more advanced content as part of patient notifications, nor to create redundant requirements where hospitals already have a suitable notification system in place. Accordingly, while we specified that hospitals subject to the proposal possess a sy stem utilizing this standard, we proposed that hospitals could utilize other 60 Office of the National Coordinator. (n.d.). Admission, Discharge, a nd Transfer. R standards or features to s uppor t their notification systems. We requested commen t on the proposal , including whether this requirement would achieve the goal of setting a baseline for hospitals ' capacity to ge nerate inf ormation for electronic notifications, while still allowing for innovative approache s that would potentially increase th e effectiven ess of these no tifications toward improving patient outcomes and safety during transi tions in care. We further proposed that the hospital would need to demonstrate that the system's notification capacity was fully operational, that it operated in accordance with all state and federal statutes and regulations regarding the exchange of patient health informati on. We intended for these notifications to be required, at minimum, for inpatients admitted to, and discharged and/or transferred from the hospital. However, we also noted that patient event notifications are an e ffective tool for coordi nating care across a wider set of patients that may be cared for by a hospital. For instance , a patient event notification could ensure that a primary care physician was aware that his or her patient had r eceived care at the emergency room, and initiate outreach to the patient to e nsure that appropriate follow -up for the emergency visit was pursued. While we encouraged hospitals to extend the coverage of their notificati on systems to serve additional patients, outside of those admitted a nd seen as inpatients, we also sought comment on whether we should identify a broader set of pa tients to whom this requirement would apply, and if so, how we should implement such a requirement in a way that minimizes administrative burden on hospitals. Additionally, we proposed that the hospital would have to demonstrate that its system sends notifications that i nclude the minimum patient health i nformation (specifically, patient name, treating practitioner name, sending institution name, and, if not p rohibited by other applicable law, patient diagnosis). We proposed that the hospital would also need to demonstrate CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 291 that the syste m sends notifications directly, or through an intermediary that facilitates exchange of health information, at the time of the patient's hospita l admission, discharge, or transfer , to licensed and qualified practitioners, other patient care team members, and PAC services providers and suppliers that: (1) receive the notificati on for treatment, care coordination, or quality improvement purposes; (2) have an est ablished care relationship with the patient relevant to hi s or her care; and (3) the hospital has reasonable certainty that such notifications are received. We noted that we believe d the proposal would allow for a diverse set of strategies that hospitals might use when implementing patient event notifications. Through these provisions, we sought to allow for different ways that a hospital might identify those practitioners, other patient care team members, a nd PAC services providers and suppliers that are most relevant to both the pre-admission a nd post- discharge care of a patient. We proposed that hospitals send notifications to those practitioners or providers that had an established care relationship with the patient relevant to h is or her care. We recognized that hospitals and their partners may identif y appropriate recipients through various methods. For instance, hospitals migh t identify appropriate practitioners by requesting this information from patients or caregivers up on arrival, or by obtaining information about care team members from the patient's record. We expected hospital s might develop or optimi ze processes to capture informati on about established care relationships directly, or work with a n intermediary that maintains information a bout care relationships. In other cases, we noted that hospitals may, directly or through an intermediary, identify appropriate notification recipients through the analysis of care patterns or other attribution m ethods that seek to determine the provide r most likely to be a ble to effectively coordinate care post- discharg e for a s pecifi c patient. The hos pital or intermediary might also develop processes to allow a provider to specifically request CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 292 notifications for a given patient for whom they are responsible for care coordination as confirmed through conversations with the patient. Additionally, we expected hospitals, psychiatric hospitals, and CAHs to comply with the HIPAA Rules set out at 45 CFR parts 160 and 164 if these proposed CoP requirements for patient event notifications were finalized. As required at 42 CFR 482.11 for hospitals and psychiatric hospitals and at 42 CFR 485.608 for CAHs, these providers must comply with all pertinent currently existing federal laws, including the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules. The Privacy Rule permits patient event notifications as disclosures for treatment purposes (the proposed required noti fications, when finalized, also may be treated as disclosures required by law (see 45 CFR 164.502(a)). We also recognized that factors outside of the hospital's control might determine whether or not a notification was successfully received and utilized by a practitioner. Accordingly, we proposed that a hospital would only need to send notifications to those practitioners for whom the hospital has reasonable certainty of receipt. While we stated that we expected hospitals would, to the best of their abili ty, seek to ensure that notification recipients were able to receive notifications (for instance, by obtaining a recipient's Direct address 61), we understood that technical issues beyond the hospital's control could prevent successful receipt and use of a notification. Finally, we noted that hospitals have an existing responsibility under the CoPs at 42 CFR 482.43(d) to \"transfer or refer patients, along with necessary medical information, to appropriate facilities, agencies, or outpatient services, as need ed, for follow -up or ancillary care.\" We 61 For more information about obtaining a Direct addresses, see https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/directbasicsforprovidersqa_05092014.pdf . CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 293 emphasize d that the proposal regarding patient event notifications would be separate from the requirement regarding necessar y medical information at 42 CFR 482.43( d). However, we recognized that processe s to implement the proposal, if finalized, coul d intersect with the hospital's discharge planning process. We noted that nothing in the proposal would affect the hospital's responsibilities unde r 42 CFR 482.43( d). However, we noted if the proposal was finalized, hospi tals migh t wish to conside r ways to fulfill these requirements in ways that reduce redundancy while still remaining compliant with existing requirements. For instance, where appropriate and allowe d by law, hospitals might seek to include require d necessary m edical information within the same message as a patient event notification. C. Provisions for Psychiatric Hospitals (42 CFR 482.61( f)) Medicare- and Medicaid- participating psychiatric hospitals must comply with all of the hos pital CoPs at 42 CFR 482.1 through 482.23 and at 42 CFR 482.25 through 482.57. They also must adhere to special provisions regardi ng medical records at 42 CFR 482.61 and staffing requirement s at 42 CFR 482.62. Since the medical records requirements are different for psychiatric hospitals, and since these hospitals do not have to comply with the regulations at 42 CFR 482.24 , we proposed a new electronic notificati on standard at 42 CFR 482.61( f) within the special provisions for psychiatric hospitals in this section. Simila r to the propos a l for hospitals at 42 CFR 482.24( d), we proposed a new standard at 42 CFR 482.61(f), \"Electronic Notifications,\" that would require psychiatric hospitals to send electronic patien t event notifications of a patient's admission, discharge, and/or transfer to another health care facility or to another community provider. As we proposed for hospitals, we proposed to limit this requirement to only those psychiatric hospitals w hich currently po ssess E HR systems w ith the technical capacity to CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 294 generate information for electronic patient event notifications, defined as systems that utilize the content exchange standard incorporated by reference at 45 CFR 170.205(a)(4)(i). We proposed that that for a psychiatric hospital that currently possessed an EHR system with the capacity to generate the basic patient personal or demographic information for electronic patient event (ADT) notifications, compliance with the proposed standard within the Special medical records requirements for psychiatric hospitals CoP (42 CFR 482.61) would be determined by the hospital demonstrating that its system: (1) is fully operational and that it operated in accordance with all state and federal statutes and regulations regarding the exchange of patient health information; (2) utilizes the content exchange standard incorporated by reference at 45 CFR 170.205(a)(4)(i); (3) sends notifications that would have to include the minimum patient health information (specifically, patient name, treati ng practitioner name, sending institution name, and, if not prohibited by other applicable law, patient diagnosis); and (4) sends notifications directly, or through a n intermediar y that facilitates exchange of health information, and at the time of the patient's admission to the hos pita l and eithe r immediately prior to or at the time of the patient's discharge and/or transfer from the hospital. We re quested comment on the policy as part of t his hospital proposal in section X.B. of the CMS Interoperabilit y and Patient Access proposed rule (84 FR 7650 through 7652). We a lso proposed that th e hospital would need to demonstrat e t hat the system sends notifications directly, or through a n intermediar y that facilitates exchange of health information, and eithe r immediately prior to or at the time of the patient's hospital admission, discharge, or transfer, to licensed a nd qualified practitioners, other patient care team members, and PAC services providers and suppliers that: (1) receive the notification for treatment, care coordination, or quality improvement purpos es; (2) have a n established care r elationship with the patient CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 295 relevant to his or her care; and (3) the hospital is reasonably certain will receive such notifications. We referre d readers to the extended discussion of the proposals in sections X.A. and B. of the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access proposed rule (84 FR 7649 through 7652). We sought comment on these proposals. D. Provisions for CAHs (42 CFR 485.638(d)) We believe implementation of patient event notifications are also importan t for CAHs to suppor t improved care coordination from these facilities to other providers in their communities. Therefore, simila r to the proposals for the hospita l and psychiatric hospita l medica l records requirement s as di scussed in the preceding sections, we proposed to revise 42 CFR 485.638, by adding a new standard to the CAH Clinical records CoP at paragraph (d), \"Electronic Notifications.\" As di scussed, the proposed standard would requir e CAH s to send electronic patien t event notifications of a patient's admiss ion, discharge, and/or transfer to another health care facility or to another community provider. We proposed to limit this requirement to onl y those CAHs which currently possess EHR systems with the technica l capacity to generate information for electronic patien t event notifications, define d as systems that utilize the content exchange standard incorporated by reference at 45 CFR 170.205(a)(4)(i). We proposed that for a CAH that currently possessed an EHR system with the capacity to generat e the basic patient persona l or d emographic information for electronic patient event (ADT ) notifications, compliance with the proposed standard within the Cl inical records services CoP (42 CFR 485.6 38) would be determined by the CAH demonstrating that its system : (1) is fully operationa l and that it op erates in accordance with all state a nd federal statutes and regulations r egarding th e exchange o f patient health information; CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 296 (2) utilizes the content exchange standard incorporated by reference at 45 CFR 170.205(a)(4)(i) ; (3) sends notifications that would have to include the minimum patient health information (specifically, patient name, treati ng practitioner name, sending institution name, and, if not prohibited by other applicable law, patient diagnosis); and (4) sends notifications directly, or through a n intermediar y that facilitates exchange of health information, and at the time of the patient's admission to the C AH and eithe r immediately prior to or at the time of the patient's dischar ge and/or transfer from the CAH. We requested comment on the policy as part of the hospital proposal in section X.B. of the CMS Interoperabilit y and Patient Access proposed rule (84 FR 7650 through 7652). Additionally, we proposed that the CAH would need to demonstrate that the system sends notifications directly, or through a n intermediar y that facilitated exchange of health information, and at or immediately prior to the time of the patient's CAH admissio n, discharge, or transfer , to licensed and qualified practitioners, other patient care team members, and PAC services providers and suppliers that: (1) receive the notificati on for treatment, care coordination, or quality improvement purposes; (2) have an established care relationship with the patient relevant to his or her care; and (3) the CAH is reasonably certain will receive such notifications. E. Comments and Responses on the Provisions of the Proposed Rule; Final Actions and Provisions of the Final Rule f or Hospitals (42 CFR 482.24( d)), Psychiatric Hospitals (42 CFR 482.61(f)); and CAHs (42 CFR 485.638(d)) We requested comments on the proposals including stakeholder feedback about how the proposals should be operationalize d. Additionally, we sought comment on how CMS should implement the se pr oposal s as pa rt of survey and certification guidanc e in a manner that minimizes compliance burden on hospitals, psychiatric hospitals, and CAHs while ensuring CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 297 adherence with the standards. We also sought stakehol der input about a reasonable timeframe fo r implementation of these proposal s for hospitals, ps ychiatri c hospitals, and C AHs, respectively. We received more than 600 publi c comment s on t his s ection that wer e specifi c to the patien t event notification requi rements proposed for inclusion in the CoPs, but which generally did not distinguish among the requirements individually proposed for hospitals, psychiatric hospitals, and CAHs at 42 CFR 482. 24(d), 482.61(f), and 485.638(d), respectively. W e summarize the public comments we received on our proposals relate d to the Conditions of Participation a nd provide our responses in this section. This summary of the public comments and our responses apply equall y to all three provider types included under this proposed requirement and the specific provisions propose d for each unless otherwise noted. We provide the final actions and the provisions of the final rule at the end of this section. Comment: Many commenters supporte d the proposals to require hospitals (including psychiatri c hospitals) and CAH s to send electronic pa tient event notifications of a pa tient's admission, discharge, and/or transfer to anothe r health care facility or to anothe r community provider. Commenters stated th at they be lieved implementing patien t event notifications would be a highly effective tool to improve care transitions for patients moving between a hospita l and other settings, includi ng returning home. Commenters believed that increasing the sharing of patien t event notifications at admissio n and discharge can lead to improved outcomes, higher quality, a nd lower cost care. Commenters also pointe d to many instances in which these notifications are being utilized today, stating that they believe that patient event notifications had effectively contributed to improve d care coordination. For instance, one commenter pointe d to the statewide requirement for hosp itals in Maryland to trans mit no tifications, noting that this has been an important policy supporting care coordination in the state. Several commenters noted CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 298 that the availability of notification information is especially important for the success of value- based payment models, such as AC O initiatives, wher e participant s may be financially at risk for costs associated with poor car e transitions . Response : We appreciate commenters ' suppo rt for the proposa l and are finalizing our proposal with modifications as discussed below. Comment : While many commenter s agreed that patient event notifications are an im portant way to improve care coordination, some disagreed that the CoPs were the appropriate vehicle for advancing their use. Many commenters stated that by placi ng the patient event notification requirements in the CoPs, C MS is putting hospitals ' participation in Medicare at risk, whic h they stated would be an excessive penalt y for failure to implement patient event notifications in accordance with the proposed requirements. Commenters also stated that the survey and certification proce ss was not well -suited to de termining compliance with the proposed CoP \"Electronic notifications\" standard. These commenters questioned how surveyor s would assess c omplianc e with the requirements, including one commenter who questioned how a hospital would demonstrate that its system sent notifications that improve the coordination of car e, a nd not just show that its system is merely functioni ng as require d. They further stated that a survey team would need clear guidance on how to assess pr oviders for compliance to ensure that hospitals are transmitting patient information to, and receiving it from, other providers. Additionally, one commenter s tated tha t hospital accreditation programs are not the appropriate entities to assess c ompliance, due t o the technical nature o f the requirements. CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 299 Commenters also expressed c oncern that tying these requirements to the CoPs could lead to hospitals sending more information than is necessary to ensure compliance, further increasing excessive information received by providers. Response : We a ppreciat e the commenters' concerns regar d ing use of the CoPs to advance the use of patien t notifications ; how ever, we disagree that the CoPs are an inappropriate vehicle for this purpose. We believe that the capabilit y to send patient event notifications should be a fundamental feature of hos pital medical record system s to su pport effectiv e care transitions and promote patient safety during t ransitions. This belie f is consistent with the statutory authority for establishi ng and appropriately updating the CoPs as that authorit y is contained in section 1861(e) of the Act, which defines ins titutions that meet the definition of a hospita l for Medicare pur poses. Specifically, section 1861(e)(2) of the Act requires that a hospita l \"maintains clinical records on all patients,\" and secti on 1861(e)(9) of the Act requires that a hospita l \"meet s such other requirement s as th e Secretary finds necessary in the interest of the heal th and safety of individuals who are furnished services in the institution.\" As discusse d in the proposed rule (84 FR 7650) , we believe patient event notifications can hel p to improve care coordination for patients discharged from the hospital and reduce the incidence of events such as hospital readmissions that coul d have been avoided through more timely follow- up care. Further, inc luding a CoP requirement for patient event notifications at the time of a patient' s discharge or transfer a s w e have proposed and are finalizing in this rul e is also consistent with section 1861(ee)(2) of the Act, which states that the Secretary shall develop guidelines and standards for the discharge planning process in order to ensure a timely and smooth transition to th e most appropriate type of and setting for post-hospita l or r ehabilitative care. We b elieve p atient event notifications are a n effective tool f or ensuring tha t the settings CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 300 responsible for follow -up care are made aware that their patients have been discharged in an expeditious manner. W e believe that these notifications can be utilized to more effectively trigge r ca r e coordination activiti es that promote timely transitions. We have chosen to i nclude these requirement s in the CoPs for medical records services, and not thos e for discharge planning, because we believe that the medical records CoPs provide a more global approach to the notifications than do the discharge planning CoPs, especially since we are requiring notifications for inpatien t admissions as well as ED and outpatien t obs ervation admissions or registrations in a ddition to patien t discharges and transfers. Therefore, given thi s statutory authority, we maintai n that the CoPs are an appropriate vehicle for advancing the use of patient event notifications. We a lso disagree that the C oP s are an inappropriat e vehicle for this po licy due to what the commenters' characteriz e as th e disproportionat e penaltie s associated with noncompliance with this CoP. W e note that while the CoPs are a significan t regulatory mechanism, noncompliance with one subordinate standard under one CoP must be considere d relative to a hospital's complia nce or noncompliance with the many other CoPs and standards as well as the severity of the nonc ompliance and the risk it poses to patient healt h and safety. Under the heading, \"Determining the Severity of Deficiencies,\" the State Operations Manual (SOM), Appendix A-Survey Protocol, Regulations and Interpretive Guidelines for Hospitals cites the regulations at 42 CFR 488.26 (\"The decision as to whether there is compliance with a particular requirement, condition of participation, or condition for coverage, depends upon the manner and degree to which the provider or supplier satisfies the various standards within each condition.\") as the basis for determining the various levels of noncompliance with the CoPs during a survey CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 301 (https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and Guidance/Guidance/Manuals/downloads/som107ap_a_hospitals.pdf ; the SOM, Appendix A: \"When noncompliance with a condition of participation is noted, the determination of whether a lack of compliance is at the Standard or Conditi on level depends upon the nature (how severe, how dangerous, how critical , etc.) and extent (how prevalent, how many, how pervasive, how often, e tc.) of the lack of com pliance. T he cited level of the nonc ompliance is determined by the interrelationship between the nature and extent of the noncompliance. \"A deficiency at the Conditi on level may be due to noncompliance with requirements in a single standard or severa l standards within the condition, or with requirements of noncompliance with a single part (tag) representing a seve re or critical health or safety breach. Even a seemingly smal l breach in c ritica l actions or at critical times can kill or severely injure a patient, and represents a critical or s evere health or safety th reat. \" A deficiency is at the Standard level when there is nonc ompliance with any single requiremen t or severa l requirements within a particula r st andard that are not of such character as to s ubstantially limit a facility's capacity to furnish adequate care, or which w ould not jeopardize or adversely affect the health or sa fety of patients if the deficient practice recurred.\" Regarding the comments questioning how surveyors, e ither state surveyors or those from one of the hospita l accreditation programs, would determine compliance with the notification requirements, we will issue, as we d o with all new or revised C oP requirements, new interpretive guidelines , which include survey procedures , for the State Operations Manual, following finalization of this rule and prior to the rule's effective date. We will advise and train state surveyors on the new requirements as is the normal procedure when new and/or revised CoPs CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 302 and standards are finalized. For example, the current Medical Record Services CoP requirements, contained at 42 CFR 482.24, and in which we are finalizing these new patient event notification requirements, primarily contain provisions for administrative systems or processes where the hospital is responsible for demonstrating that the various components of its medical records system or process are in place and operational in order to comply with the overall requirements of the CoP. Surveyors would then approach these new requirements in a similar fashion and apply similar survey procedures and methods that do not require surveyors to have deep technical knowledge of various systems in order to determine compliance. As with the survey of the hospital's total medical re cords system, surveyors would utilize basic and effective survey procedures and methods such as: Review of the organizational structure and policy statements and an interview with the person responsible for the medical records service to first ascertain that the hospital has a system that meets the initial requirements for patient event notifications in order to determine whether or not the hospital is exempt from the specific patient event notification requirements that follow. Review of a sample of active and closed medical records for completeness and accuracy, including any patient event notifications, in accordance with federal and state laws and regulations and hospital policy. Interview of medical records and other hospital staff, including physicians and other practitioners, to determine understanding of the patient events notification function of the system. Conducting observations and interviews with medical records staff and leadership to determine if requirements for patient event no tifications are being met. CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 303 CMS-approved accreditation organizations (AOs) with hospital programs are required, at a minimum, to enfor ce standards that meet or exceed hospital CoP requirements, so each AO will be responsible for training its survey and accreditation staff on the patien t event notification requirement s finalized in this rul e ahead of the applicable d ate established by CMS. Finally, the patien t event notification re quirements that we are finalizing require a hospital to send only a minima l amount of pa tient information in order to be in compliance with the provisions. These requirements a r e consistent with our belie f that existing patient event notification systems have demonstrated that a minima l set of information can achieve the desired effect of improving care coordination while imposing minimal burden on providers . However, hospitals are not prohibited from sending more detailed in formation unde r the se requirements and we would expect each hospital is full y aware of its own capacity to send additional patient information, other applicable laws gove rning this, and the capacities of the intende d recipients to receive additional patient information, and would base its decisions to send additional information on these factors as w ell as on what i s best for the patient. Based on our experience with hospitals, we disagree with the commenter that a hos pital would unnecessarily send \"excessive\" amounts of patien t information in an attempt to ensure a determination that the hospital was in compliance. To prevent such confusion, we have clearly delineated the patient information requirements in thi s final rule. C omment : Many commenters stated that the CoPs were not appropriate for advancing goals related to interoperability a nd the use of health IT. Commenters stated that CMS currently regulates provider use of technology through a variety of other avenues , such as the Promoting Interoperability Programs, and that adding the proposed requirements under the CoPs would add an unnecessary additional mechanism for addressing thes e issues. Commenters b elieved this CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 304 could lead to additional provider burden and confusion, as stakeholders would be require d to navigate duplicative requirements a round the electronic exchange of information. Several commen ters stated that , by shifting focus to compliance with the proposed requirements, and requiring hospitals to engage in duplicative reporting on information exchange, this proposal could divert funding a nd attenti on from necessary investments in interoperabl e health informati on exchange. Commenters state d that they believe d using the CoPs in this fashion was inconsistent with congressional intent for how HHS should regulate the use of health IT. Commenters also not ed that HHS is currently seeking to establis h a range of new policies designe d to advance the interoperable exchange of health information. Commenters believed these policies could have a significant impact on the sharing of health information, including the sharing of patien t event notifications, and that CMS should refrain from rulemaking through the CoPs unt il the se pol ices have been finalized. One commenter also noted that, at the time the commen t period on the CMS Interoperability and Patien t Access proposed rule closed, CMS' Discharge Planni ng rule (80 FR 68125) had not yet been finalized, a nd that it would be premature to a dd this requirement in advance of finalizing related revisions to the discharge planning section of the CoPs. Commenters further stated that HHS has a variety of other mechani sms for advancing electronic information exchange and improving the infrastructure for exchange that would be more effective than adding requirements to the CoPs. Several commenters expressed concern that using the CoPs would set static requirements that a re ill-suited to an evolving technology environment and the innovation needed to increase adoption of notifications across providers. Response : We a ppreciat e commenters' input. As not ed above, we disagree with commenters who stated that the C oPs ar e not an appropriate mechanism for policy related to CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 305 interoperability or the use of health IT. Existing CoPs address requirements related to medical records systems as well as the transfer of health information, and we believe there is no reason that these regul ations should not address technology issues where the use of technology may be relevant to patient health and safety, provided that such references to technology in the CoPs do not lead to \"static requirements\" as noted by the commenter, and which we believe we have avoided doing in both the proposed and final rules. Furthermore, while a 2017 review of the current available scientific evidence on the impact of different health information technologies on improving patient safety outcomes, warned that health care organizations \"need to be selective in which technology to invest in, as literature shows that some technologies have limited evidence in improving patient safety outcomes,\" the review also stated that there \"should be no doubt that health information technology is an important tool for improving healthcare quality and safety.\" 62 According to the authors of the review, evidence from a number of studies shows that health IT offers numerous opportunities for improving and transforming health care that includes the potential to reduce human errors, improve clinical outcomes, facilitate care coordination, improve practice efficiencies, and track data over time. Based on this evidence as well as the evidence directly related to patient event notifications that we cited previously, we believe that the requirements for patient event notifications that we have proposed and that we are finalizing in this rule will have a positive impact on many of these same areas, especially regarding the facilitation of care c oordination for patients, leading to improved outcomes and enhanced patient health and safety. 62 Alotaibi, Y., & Federico, F . (2017). The impact o f health information technolog y on patient safety. Saudi Medical Journal we appreciate the importance of aligning policies across differen t programs to minimize provider burden, we believe that the proposed requirements are not addressed elsewhere and are appropriate for inclusion in the CoPs. Additionally, we disagree with commenters who stated that the proposed requirements w ill requir e hos pitals to engag e in duplicative reporting on informati on exchange since the proposed requirements do not require hospitals and CAHs to do any type of reporti ng to CMS in order to comply with the requirements. We also understa nd that other proposed or recently finalized policies may be relevant to the proposed requirement s in this rule; however, we believe these pol icies will complement one another and serve to enable the proposed requirements around patient event notifications. As we noted above regarding the final rule published on September 30, 2019, Discharge Planni ng final rule (84 FR 51836), the revised discharge planning CoPs do not require hospitals, CAHs, and HHAs to transfer necessary patien t medica l information exclusively by electronic means, nor do they require that providers notify the appropriate providers, suppliers, and practitioners receiving the necessary medical information of the patient's discharge (or admission) as we are now are requiring in this final rule. We believe that the two rules, a s written and finalized, do not conflict, but instead complement and support each other in CMS' goal of improving patien t care transitions. Therefore, we disagree with the comments s tating that the patien t event notification requirements are premature or dupl icative in relation to the final discharge planning requirements for hospitals, CAHs, and HHAs. Regarding c oncerns that it will be challenging to update the CoPs to reflec t changi ng technol ogy requirements, our proposal sought t o focus primarily on functional requirements that will allow hospitals the flexibility to pursue innovation and adapt their systems over time, s imilar to other f unctional r equirements under the Medical R ecords S ervices C oP. Wher e we d o CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 307 referenc e a specifi c standard, in order to determin e whether or not a hos pital' s system would be subject to the proposed \"Electronic notifications\" standard, we reference a content exchange standar d at 45 CFR 170.205(d)(2) common t o many EHRs that we believe is unlikely to undergo changes that would require frequent updates. Comment: Commenters stated that includi ng these requirements unde r the CoPs would significantly increase the compliance burden for providers. Commenters believed that the proposed policy was contrar y to other recent HHS burden reducti on initiatives for providers. Commenters also believed that this proposal would add additional layers of regulati on to what is a common practice for many hospitals today, further increasing provider burden. Several commenter s stated that CMS had underestimated the burden associated with this proposal. They disagreed that implementing patient event notifications would be largely limited to a one-time cost, and stated that there would be substantial work required prior to implementing the proposal and continuous work around receiving notifications from other providers. Commenter s suggested that CMS pursu e other initiative s to al leviate costs, such as standardizing the data set for patient event notifications. Stakeholders also urged CMS to ensure that providers have cost-effectiv e choices for required technology solutions, and to not creat e an environment that encourages over-pricing of solutions. Response: We a ppreciat e commenters' concerns about additional provider burden. While we unde rstand that this new requirement may impose some additional implementation burden on hospitals, commenter s also expressed that there are many ways for hospital s to minimi ze this burden through the use of existing technologies and services, such as health information exchanges and other service providers which capture notification information from a hospital's EHR and route it to appropriate recipients. We believe that there is sufficient f lexibility in the CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 308 current proposal to ensure hospitals have a broad range of options for implementati on and will be able to c omply in a way that aligns with their existing capabilities. We believe that care coordination can have a significant positive impact on the quality of life, consumer experience, and health outcomes for patients . However, we acknowledge that though suc h activities can have positive impact, they will likely generate some costs. We believe it is difficult to qua ntify the impac t of t hese changes because EHR implementation acros s care setting s varies in maturity rates, leading to potential varianc e in cost and impact acros s such s ettings. Nonetheless, we have attempted to estimate the burden for those hospitals and CAHs that currently ut ilize electroni c medical records system s or other electronic admi nistrative systems that are conformant with the content exchange standard at 45 CFR 170.205( d)(2), and which generat e information to support th e basic message s commonly used for electronic pa tient event notifications, but which are not currentl y transmitti ng notifications. The cost of implementing these change s will include a one -time cost related to initia l implementation of the notification system. Additionally, we have also estimated recurring maintenanc e costs for either those hospitals or CAHs that use hospita l or C AH IT services s taf f to perfor m this recurring maintenance, or for those hospitals and CAHs that contrac t with third party outside services provider s to perform this maintenance. We a lso stress that the requirements that we are finalizing here do not mandate that a hospital or CAH must purchase and implement a new EHR system. Rather, as finalized here, the provisions require a hospital or a CAH to demonstrate compliance with al l o f the provisions containe d at 42 CFR 482.24( d), 482.61(f), a nd 485.638(d) only if it utilizes an electronic medica l records syste m or other electronic administrative syste m that is conformant with the content exchange standard at 45 CFR 170.205(d)(2) . We note here then that a hospital or a CAH that does not meet the basic requirements denoted in the standard language CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 309 at paragraphs 42 CFR 482.24(d), 482.61(f), and 485.638(d) is exempt from demonstrating compliance with the re quirements th a t follow and will not b e survey ed for tho se specific provisions once a surveyor determines that the system used by the hospital or CAH is not conformant with the content exchange standard discussed here. Comment: Many commenters supporte d the proposal to limit the application of the proposed requirements to hospitals that possess a system capable of generating information for patient event notifications, while several disagreed with CMS and thought that CMS should not limit these requirements to only certain hospitals. Numerous commenter s also sought additional informati on on how CMS will determine whether a hospital's system is subject to the proposed CoP standard. Commenters stated that the proposed rule did not indicate how surveyors would determine which electronic records system s possess require d attributes, and that surveyors would not have the technical expertise required t o make this determination. Response: In the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access proposed rule, we proposed to limit this requirement to only those hospitals which currently possess E HR system s with the technical capacity to generat e information for electroni c patient event notifications. We de fined a system with this c apacity as one that utilizes the ADT messaging standard, Health Level Seven (HL7 \u00ae) Messaging Standard Version 2.5.1 (HL7 2.5.1)) incorporated by reference at 45 CFR 170.205(a)(4)(i). We noted that th is standard is referenced by certification criteria related to transferring inf ormation to immunization registries, a s well as transmission of laboratory results to public health agencies as described at 45 CFR 170.315( f), and that adoption of certified health IT that meets these criteria has been require d for any hospital seeking to qualify for the Promoting Interoperability Program . We believe hospita ls and surveyor s will be able to determine w hether an EHR system possesses the c apacity to generate i nformation for electronic CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 310 patien t event notifications, defined for the purposes of the CoP as a syste m conformant with the specified ADT messaging standard (HL7 2.5.1), based on existi ng requirements for other programs, such as the Promoting Interoperability Program . In general, we believe that information about whethe r a syste m complies with this provision will be easy to obtain from a hospital's health IT developer. As discussed below, we are finalizing a citation to the ADT messaging standard (HL7 2.5.1) at 45 CFR 170.20 5(d)(2). Comment : A commenter noted that in som e instanc es a hospital' s patient event notificati on system is connecte d to the hospital's registration syste m rathe r than its EHR system, w hich is used for clinical purposes only. Response: We appreciate the comment and the opportunit y to note here that the \"electronic medical records system \" described in the CoPs is not limited to t he EHR sys tem used for the management of clinical data. Hospitals would also be permitted t o send patient event notifications using their r egistration system. B ased on this comment, we are revising the language at 42 CFR 482 .24(d), 482.61(f), and 485.638(d) in this final rule to now state that if the hospita l (or psychiatric hospita l or CAH), \"...utilizes an electronic medica l records syste m or other electronic administrative system,\" then the hospita l (or psychiatric hospita l or CAH ) would need to de monstrate that its system complies with the provisions that follow in this section. Commen t: In the proposed rule we sought comment on whether we should identify a broader set of patients to whom this requirement would apply, beyond those admitted and treated as inpatients. For instance, we not ed that a pa tient event notification could ensure a p rimary care physician i s aware t hat their patient has received care a t the emergency room, and initiate CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 311 outreach to the patient to ensure that appropriate follow- up for the emergency visit is pursued (84 FR 7651) . Many stakeholders responded to this request for comment by stating that they supported extendi ng this policy to also include patients seen in a hospital's emergency department (ED). Commenters stated that re quiring systems to be able to send these notifications would be an important way to support better care coordination and prevent unne cessary repeat visits to the emergenc y department . Commenters also suggested that this requirement should include patients seen i n the hospital for \"observational\" stays, but who are not admitted as inpatients. Response: We agree with the commenters that ED patients should be included i n the patien t event notification system, and ha ve revised the regulatory text at 42 CFR 482 .24(3)(i) and (4)(i), 482.61(3)(i) and (4)(i), and 485.638(3)(i) and (4)(i) to include these patients. Many patients registered in th e ED are eventually discharged home after being treated, while others a re either held for observation in a hospital bed as outpatients or admitted as inpatients to the hospital. The revisions we are finalizing here would require a hospital's system to send patient event notifications for patients who are registered in the ED, if applicable, and then also for patient s admitted as inpatients, r egardless if the patien t was admitted from the ED, from an observation stay, or as a direc t adm ission from ho me, from their practitioner's office, or as a transfe r from some other facility. We agree with the commenters and believe that if we were not t o inc lude ED patients in the not ification requirements in this final rule, we would miss an important opportunity for positively impa cting the care tra nsitions and the continuing care of a significant number of patients seen in the nation's hospital emergency departments . Including ED patients in the patient e vent n otification requirements is consistent w ith the purpose of the CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 312 CoPs as a regulatory means of promoting and protecting the overall health and safet y of all hospital patients, regardl ess of their p hysical locati on in the hospital. To illustrate when a patient event notificati on is, and is not, required, we would like to point out the following scenarios. A hospital's system would be expecte d to send one notification when a patient is first registered in a hospital's ED or as an observational stay (that is, in both of these cases, the patient would be considere d an outpatient and not an inpatient at this point in time), and a second notification if the same patien t was then later admitted to a hospital inpatient services unit (for example, medical unit, labor and delivery unit, telemetry unit, neurology unit, surgica l unit, int ensive care unit (ICU), etc.), or if th e same patien t was admitted for inpatient services, but was being boarded i n the ED while waiting for an inpatient unit bed. In contrast, a second patient event notification would not be required if an already admitted inpatient was transferred f rom one inpatien t services unit of t he hospita l to anothe r (for e xample, if the patient was admitted to the hospital's ICU, but was then later transferred to the hospital's \" step -down\" or \"intermediate care\" unit or to a medica l unit, in which case, the pa tient continued to remain an inpatient of the hospital), or if an already a dmitted patien t was being boarded in the ED and then was transferred t o an inpatient unit when a bed became a vailable. However, while the requirements do not prohibit a hospital from electing to se nd a patient event notification when a patien t is transferred to o ne inpatient service s unit of the hospital to another, the requirements finalized in t his rule are based on a change in the patient's status from out patien t to inpatient, and not necessarily on the physical location of the patient. Finally, in all cases, a patient's d ischarge o r transfer f ro m the hospital, eithe r from t he ED or an observational stay or an inpatient services unit, would still require the hospital to send CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 313 another and separate patient event notification to the applicable entities as required under this rule. Comment: We proposed that hospitals should send notifications to those practitioners or providers that have an established care relationship with the patien t relevant to his or her care (84 FR 7652) . Many commenters sought additional informati on about the ter m \"established car e relationship\" and how hospitals should discer n who has an establishe d care relationship with a patient. Commenters noted that the list of pr oviders who have an \"established care relationship\" with a patient could be very extensive and requested more information on the extent of the specialization of car e team members covered by the requirement. One commenter suggested CMS indicat e that the term \"established care relationship \" only applie s to one that is current and directly re lated to the p atient's diagnosis for which the not ification is sent. Anothe r commenter suggested that CMS define \"established care relationship \" as the principle physician identified by the patient and any institution that the patien t identifies. Severa l commenters suggeste d that CMS replac e the term \"established care relationship\" with \"activ e relationship,\" and noted that this w ould also ensur e payers received the notifications, as their relationship with a patient may not be included under the definiti on of a \"care\" relationshi p. One commenter suggested that CMS note that hospital s have the latitude to choo se the recipient of the notification. Commenters also sought direction on how hospitals should approach a situati on in which a patient does not have a primary care provider, or i n which a provider who has an established care relationship with the pa tient canno t be easily ide ntified. Severa l commenters noted that eff ective notification systems are often organized around a subscription model , in which receiving provi ders are responsible for identifying those patients for whom they would like to receive notifications. CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 314 Response : We a ppreciate c ommenters' input. We a gree t hat the term \"established care relationship\" could be subject to an overly broad interpretation that is not consistent with our goal to set a minimum floor for these requirements under the CoPs. Accordingly, we are finalizing a more limited set of recipients to whom a hospital's syste m must s end patient e vent notifications for the purposes of meeting this CoP. We a re finalizing at 42 CFR 482.24(d)(5), 482.61(f)(5), and 485.638(d)(5) requirements that the hospital's system send notifications to the following recipients as applicable: th e patient's e stablished primary car e practitioner; the patient's establ ished primary care practice group or entity; or other practitioners or practice groups or entities, identified by the patient as the practitioner, or practice group or entity, primarily responsible for h is or her care. We believe that t he use of the modifier \"established,\" a s finalized her e in the context of a p atient' s established primary car e practitioner or his or her established primary care practice group or entity, more clearly signifies a care relationship that the patient recognizes as primary or one that is evidenced by documentation of the relationship in the p atient's medical record. As an example, if the p atient's e stablished primary car e practitioner refers the patient t o the hospital, this primary care practitioner should receive the event notification. We believe this language improves upon the proposed term \"established care relationship,\" which commenters correctly noted is too vague in meaning, too broad in scope, and too open to various interpretations, all of which could prove burdensome fo r hospitals to demonstrate compliance with the requirements here. We note tha t this final p olicy does not prevent a hospital from sending patient event notifications to other practitioners, in accordance with all applicable l aws, who may be relevant to a patient's p ost-d ischarge c are and would benefit f rom receiving patient e vent notifications, nor would it prevent a hospital f rom seeking to identify these other p ractitioners. However, we believe this more limited set of r ecipients is more CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 315 appropriate to our goal of s etting baseline requirements and will provide hospitals with sufficient specificity to comply with the requirements. In cases where a hospital is not able to identify a primary care practitione r for a patient, the patient h as not identified a provider to whom they would like information about their care to be sent, or there is no applicable PAC provider or supplier identified, we would not expect a hospital to send a patient event notificati on for that patient. We note that unde r the CoP, a hospi tal would be re quired to demonstrate th a t its syste m sends notifications to appropriate recipients . We expect that hospitals would demonstrate this capabilit y in variety of ways, for instance, by demonstrating that the hospital ha s processe s and polici es in place to identify patients ' primary care practitioners and incorporate this information into the patient event notification system, or through recording information received from patients abou t their pr oviders. Comment : Commenters stated that obtaining information about providers who have an \"established care relationship\" with a given patient and maintaining lists of these providers and contac t information for delivery of patie n t event notifications would impo se significan t burden on hospitals. One comm enter noted th at patients may not re liably provide information a bout their pr oviders, and recommended that i n those cases the recipient of the patient event notification should identify their relationship with a patient in advance. Several commenters noted that , to the extent hospitals already have operational processes and infrastructure in place to determine destinations for notifications, these processes should be left in place. Severa l c ommenters noted that, in order to successfully route message s to the appropriate provider, hospitals would need to be able to overcome challenges associated with patient m atching : the ability for a hospita l to accurately match records about a patien t with the CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 316 records held by a receiving provider. Commenter s stated that challenge s with patient matching could inhibit patien t event notifications from being received by the correct provide r and will lead to frequent pushback from providers about receiving notifications regarding patients they are not affiliated with. Commenters also noted the importance of community -wide directories that map t he address of a provider to their electronic endpoint destination, whic h would allow a hospital to query a directory a nd find the destination of the patient's choice. Respons e: As noted, we are finalizing a more limited minimu m set of r ecipients for patient event notifications than originally proposed. This set of recipients is focused on a patient' s established primary care practitioner (or established pri mary care practice group or entity) or any other practitione r (or practice group or entity) identified by the patient as primarily responsible for his or her c are. H owever, we are retaining inclusion in this final rule of PAC providers and suppliers as required recipients of notifications as originally proposed. In order to clarify the PAC services provider s and supplier s that ar e required recipients, we are modifying this pr oposal to refer to \"all applicable P AC servi ces pr ovider s and suppliers.\" For purpos es of this policy, applicable PAC services providers and suppliers would be thos e PAC services providers and suppliers with whom the patient has an established care relationship prior to admission or to whom the patient is being transferred or referred. S imilar to our modification to referenc e the patient' s established primary care practitioner, t hese PAC services p rovider s and suppliers would be those with an established care re lationship immediately preceding the hospita l registration or admission (such as a PAC s ervices provide r or supplie r from which the patient was transferre d to the hospital) or those with which a relationshi p is being establishe d for purposes of treatmen t and/or care coordination post-discharge from the hospital. The potential recipients o f patient event n otifications w ill be limited to only those tha t need to receive CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 317 notification of the patient's status for treatment, care coordination, or quality improvement purposes. We believe that this final policy will reduce potential operational burden associated with a broader \"established care relationship\" definition. We believe that increasing numbers of hospitals now commonly seek to identify patients' primary care practitioners and their contact information, including any digital contact information, or par tner with intermediaries that identify primary care practitioners, and that many hospitals will be able to continue to use their existing processes to satisfy the CoP. If a hospital has processes in place for identifying patients' primary care practitioner s and other applicable providers, but is not able to identify an appropriate recipient for a patient event notification for a specific patient, the hospital would not be expected to send a notification for that patient. Research using CMS data on readmissi on rates in Medicare- participating hospitals from 2007 to 2015 shows that the readmission rates for targeted conditions (that is, a set of specific diagnoses measured by Medicare) declined from 21.5 percent to 17.8 percent, and rates for non- targeted conditions declined from 15.3 percent to 13.1 percent. 63 While this decline in readmissions rates is attributable to multiple factors, we believe that one of the significant factors driving down avoidable patient readmissions is identification by the hospital of the patient's established primary care practitioner (or practice group) and his or her contact information prior to discharge and/or transfer. Increased and early identification of the patient's primary care practitioner is more likely to lead to more accurate and timely transfer of patient health informa tion from hospital -based practitioners to community- based primary care practitioners. Additionally, early identification of a patient's primary care practitioner along with the patient 63 Alper, E., O'Malley, T. A., & Greenwald, J . (n.d.). Hospital discharge and readmission. Retrieved from https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospital-d ischarge -and-readmission. CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 318 event notification to the practitioner that his or her patient is about to be discharged from the hospital is most likely to have a net positive effect on scheduled post- discharge follow -up rates for patients most at risk for avoidable readmissions. We appreciate commenters concerns about patient matching challenges. This is a larger issue beyond the scope of this CoP proposal and this current rule, but we will consider this issue for future revisions and updates to the CoPs. With the continued increase in the use of electronic data in health care organizations and among prov iders of health care services, there has been a continued need for patient matching, or patient identity management (PIM) processes, in health care organizations, including hospitals. PIM has been defined as the ability to uniquely ascertain the identity o f a patient, assign that patient's record an identifier that is unique within the organization, system, or exchange network, and match that patient's record within and between systems using a number of demographic data elements, such as the patient's first name, last name, address, and date of birth. Effective PIM supports patient identity integrity, which the National Association of Healthcare Access Management defines as accurately identifying and matching the right patient with his or her complete medica l record, every time, in every provider setting. 64 Accurate patient identity management is critical to successfully delivering the right care to the correct patients. Capturing incorrect or incomplete data can result in critical patient care issues and ri sk privacy breaches. Health care organizations are more likely to have their EHR system filled with duplicate patient records and inaccurate information about their patients when they are not managing an effective PIM process. Having an ineffective PIM pro cess will most definitely 64 National Association of Healthcare Access Management. (2016, March 17). NAH AM Public Policy Statement on Patient Identity Integrity. Retrieved from https://nahamnews.blogspot.com/2016/03/naham -p ublic -policy -statement - 319 negatively impact a hospital's patient event notification system, which is one of the many reasons why a rigorous PIM process is essential to patient care as health IT moves forward. Additionally, PIM has become crucial in order to (1) enable health record document consumers to obtain trusted views of their patient subjects; (2) facilitate data exchange projects; (3) abide by the current regulations concerning patient information-related transparency, privacy, disclosure, handling, and documentation; and (4) make the most efficient use of limited health care resources by reducing redundant data collection. 65 Natio nally recognized practices and standards for ensuring patient identity integrity have been identified by organizations s uch as the National Association of Healthcare Access Management, American Health Information Management Association, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and ONC. These standards include standardizing demographic data fields and internally evalu ating the accuracy of patient matching within health care organizations. We believe this presents an opportunity for the health IT industry to lead the way in developing innovative solutions to patient matching, or PIM, that can benefit all facets of the health care industry. However, appreciating the importance of accurate patient matching, CMS will continue to evaluate ways to support improved patient matching solutions. Comment: Several commenters suggested additional provider types that should receive patient event notifications. For instance, commenters suggested health plans should be included on the list of recipients for patient event notifications, noting that this information would be valuable to plans responsible for coordinating services for beneficiaries and reducing 65 Gliklich, R., Dreyer , N., & Leavy, M. (Eds.). (2014). Registries for Evaluating Patient Outcomes: A User's Guide (3rd readmissions. One commenter also recommended sending notifications to public health departments. Several commenter s also requested that specific health care professional s be identified as recipients. Commenters also suggested that other caregivers such as relative s be included on the list of r e cipients. Response: We appreciate commenters' suggestions about adding additional recipients for patien t event notifications. While there may be other entities that could benefi t from receiving patien t event notifications, we believe it is more a ppropriate for the purposes of the CoP requirements to focus on a minima l set of r ecipients for notifications. T his approach would not preclude hospitals from sending notifications to other entities, including health plans , provided hospitals comply wit h applicable laws and regulations regarding sharing of patient data. Comment : Many commenters suggested that CMS should consider approache s that aim to inc entivize providers t o implement patien t event notifications, rathe r than requiring hospitals to do so through the CoPs. Commenters stated that adding this requirement would result in unnecessary and burdensome duplication of requirements that hospitals are already subject to as part of existing programs focused on advancing healt h information exchange. Specificall y, many commenters recommended that CMS seek to advanc e the se goals through the Promoting Interoperability Program. Commenters suggested CMS consider adding a measure to the program based on patien t event notifications, noting that such a measure could mirror the \"active engagement\" concept currently use d for public health measures unde r the program or be assessed through an attestation simila r to current attestations related to information blocking. S everal commenters also noted our discussion of potentially es tablishing a set of \"health IT activities\" under the Promoti ng Interoperability Program (84 FR 7618) that would not be linked to performance measures, noting that such a concept would be w ell -suited to advancing patient CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 321 event notifications. One commente r noted that th e Promoting Interoperability Program, with its annual performance assessment , is more appropriate to supporting progress on technology goals than the CoPs, and that a measur e reported annually could better ass ess the degree to which providers are improvi ng their usage of patient event notifications. Commenters also recommended other alternativ e strategi es that CMS could engage in to incentiviz e use of patient event notifications, such as models establishe d under Innovation Center authority. Commenters believed that highlighting the use of patien t event notifications in connecti on with alternative payment models could help to strengthen the business case for this intervention. Anothe r co mmente r recommended that the use of patient event notifications could be incentivized thr ough an offset or bonus in a hospital-focused quality program, or through offering regulatory flexibility (for instance around te lehealth) to hospitals that choose to implement a syste m for notifications. Response : We a ppreciate c ommenters' suggestions t o encourag e the use of patient event notifications through the Promoting Interoperability Program. In order for an action to serve as the b asis f or a measur e under the Promoting Interoperability Program, the action must r equire the use of certified health IT. As discussed in the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access proposed r ule, at this time there is no certification criterion included in ONC's certification program f or the creation and transmission of patient event notifications (84 FR 7651). As discussed elsewhere in this final rule, ONC does not believe there is a widely adopted consensus standard for patient event n otifications at this time. ONC will c ontinue to monitor adoption of standards for this use case and consider whether it would be appropriate to develop a certification criterion for this functionality. Accordingly, we believe it would not be feasible to add a measure related to p atien t even t notifications to the Promoting Interoperability Program at this time. CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 322 We appreciate commenters input about other programs that could advance the use of patient event notifications, such as models established under Innovation Center authorit y, and will take these unde r consideration. Comment : Several commenters a ddressed the use of the ADT standard for patient event not ifications. One commenter noted that the ADT messaging standar d is very broad and that implementations are subjec t to significant variability and customization. Commenters highl ighted the fact that there is significan t variation in the implementation of the ADT standard, limiting interoperability acros s interf aces us ing this s tandard, and suggested that CMS clarify specifi c content and triggering events for ADT data exchange. Another commente r noted that the lack of an implementation guide for the use of ADT messages for notifications is challenging, as this guidance is essential for unde rstanding what informati on must be sent and how. Commenters who believed that the reference to the ADT standard would require the establishment of new interfaces for exchanging ADT messages stated that recipient providers would not be able to receive ADT messages if they do not have an inbound ADT interface in place. Many commenters believed that specifyi ng the HL7 2.5.1 ADT message standard would be overly restrictive and recommended that CMS not specify a specifi c standard for th ese transactions at this time. C ommenters urged C MS to focus on creating functiona l requirements rathe r than identifying specifi c mechanism s or standards f or the data. Other commenter s stated that any standar d should be required as a floor, rather than a ceiling. One stakeholder recommended that CMS compile stakeholder feedbac k to better understand which standard would be preferred by the industry. Several commenters supported adoption of the ADT message standard (HL7 2.5.1), stating that it i s the mos t frequently used standard for the transmission of patien t event CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 323 notifications. One commenter urged CMS to avoid policies that allow a hospita l to deviate from a required standard, a nd to align with standards proposed by ONC to ensure consistency across different typ es of data ex change. One commenter suggested that CMS explore moving to later versions of the HL7 2.5.1 standar d, which provide additional message types, segments , and codes while others noted that additional work will be needed by standards setting bodies such as HL7 to develop a more robust standar d in the future. Other commenters supporte d the flexibility discus sed in the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access propose d rule with respect to using other standards and features to support sending patient event notifications . One commenter supported the flexibility provided in the proposed rule, but believed that thi s flexibility may int roduce challenges for those providers receiving and incorporating information provided by a hospital. Several commenters urged CMS to not require the use of certified EHR technology (CEHRT ) to send ADT messages, n oting that hospitals currently us e a variety of so lutions to send patient event notifications. One commenter noted that the HL7 protocol cannot be sent using Direct messagi ng or other exchanges used for continuity of care documents. One commente r noted that ADT information is not available in real time, a nd that an open A PI for both the hospital and receiving provider would be needed t o enable real- time notifications. Commenters recommended that CMS instead focus on the use of standards- based feeds from the hospital's technology of choice. Response : We a ppreciat e commenters' feedback. We recognized in the CMS Interoperability a nd Patient Access proposed rule that there is currently significant variation in how hospitals have utilized ADT messages to support implementation of pat ient e vent CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 324 notifications (84 FR 7651) . In recognition of this current state, we proposed to require that a hospita l would be subjec t to this CoP if its syste m complied with the ADT messaging standard, but we did not propose to require that hospitals use a specific standard to forma t or d eliver patien t event notifications. We believe this flexibility is necessary due to significan t variation in how HL7 2.5.1 messages have been used to support notifications, and allows providers to use other standards for structuring and delivering this informati on that they may be currently using to implemen t patien t event notifications, or may prefe r to use for other reasons. As noted, our intent is to allow flexibility ; therefore, w e have refrained f r om specifying a standa rd for delivery of patien t event notifications that could be overly li miting for hos pitals. We are finalizing revised regulation text at 42 CFR 482.24( d), 482.61(f), a nd 485.638(d) hos pital system' s conforman ce with the ADT standard will be used solely to determine whether a hospital is subject to the CoP. Requirements regarding the content and forma t of the patient event notifications, which a hospital's syste m must send to satisfy the CoP, are limited to the minima l information elem ents described elsewher e in this final rule. We are not specifying a standar d for the content , format, or delivery of these notifications. We also note that we did not specify that hospitals must use a specific technology t o send patien t event notificatio ns; for instance, we did not specify that a hospital must use the capabilities of certified health IT to send notifications, nor that hos pitals must send notifications via an interface adhering to the HL7 messaging standar d. We hope that this response addresses commenters' concerns, and clarifi es that the referenc e to the HL7 messaging standard in these requirements does not preclude use of other standards for transporting patient event notifications. In addition, we note that our understanding is that many s uccessful patient event notification CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 325 implementations have used the content of HL7 messages in conjuncti on with other forms of transport, such as Direct messages. While we a gree with commenter s that common usage of a s ingle, strictly defined standard woul d increase interoperability for these transactions, we do not believe that this is possible at this time. At the same time, we strongly encourag e hos pitals, and any intermediaries a hospital may partner with, to adopt standards- based approach es to the structure and transmission of patient event notifications, including the many standards- based solutions described by commenters. We acknowledge that, at th is time, the us e of differen t sta ndards may resul t in decreased ability for certain providers to receive notifications from sending hospitals, depending on the attributes of their respective systems. We will consider whether there are additional ways we can encourage hospitals to move towards increased interoperability for the se t ransaction s in the future. We a lso wish to addres s and clarify a discrepancy in the way we referenced the ADT messaging standar d in the proposed rule. Specificall y, in the preamble of the propose d rule we cited 45 CFR 170.299( f)(2), where the HL7 2.5.1 messaging standar d is liste d for incorporation by reference. However, in the regulation text of the propose d rule, we erroneously cited to 45 CFR 170.20 5(a)(4)(i), which contains the C-CDA s tandard HL7 2.5.1. T he C-CDA standard is referenced in certification criteria related to summary of care records (84 FR 7678) . As discussed above, we are finalizing our policy that a ho spital will be subject to the requirements in this section if it uses a system conformant with the HL7 2.5.1 content exchange standard, which indicates a system ha s the basic capacity to generate information for patient event notifications. In th is final rule, w e are revising the regulation text and finalizing a citation to the HL7 2.5.1 content exchange standard where it is currently referenced at 45 CFR CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 326 170.205(d)(2). We believe that this citation is the most appropriate way to reference the HL7 2.5.1 standard. Comment : Several commenters r equested that CMS indicat e whether it would be acceptable to transmi t in formation using other standards than the ADT message, specifically deliveri ng messages using the C-CDA standar d, which providers must use to satisfy the requirements of the transitions of ca re measures unde r the Promoting Interoperability Programs. Severa l commenters stated that they w ould pr efe r to forma t messages using this standard, which they already us e for the Promoting Interoperability Program, and that a requirement to deliver m essages accordi ng to the HL7 ADT messaging standard would result in duplicative work. Others questioned whether transmitting notifications via a FHIR\u00ae-based API would be permissible. Response : In the proposed rule, we stated that a hospital' s medical records system i s a compliant system if it utilizes the ADT messaging standard . However, we did not propose a specifi c format or s tandard for the patien t event notification that a hospita l would be required to send under the propose d CoP. Thus , hospitals would be allowed to transmit patient event notifications using other standards, such as the C-CDA or via a FHIR- based API. Comment: Many commenters supporte d the inclusion of diagnosis in patient event notifications where permitted by law, stating that this information is helpful for supporting care coordination between a hospital and other providers. One commenter noted that this information can be included by leveraging certain segments of the HL7 ADT feed, and that this segment can also be f iltered for sensitive diagnoses that are prohibited for transmission unde r certain state or federal laws. CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 327 A number of commenters expresse d concerns about requiring the inclusion of diagnosis, noting that hospitals may not have this information at the time of admission, when only the presenting symptom may be available, or immediatel y at discharge. Other commenters noted that while this is important information for improving care coordination, diagnosis is not included in the most basic versions of the HL7 ADT messaging standard. Other commenters noted that clinica l data is more appropriate for transfe r through other standards for sha ring clinica l data, suc h as the C-CDA standard, whic h is specified to support the exchange of clinical summaries using certified health IT. These commenters noted that rather than requiring the inclusion of diagnosis i n the patient event notification, it would m ake more sense to allow hospital s to transfe r this information by attaching a clinica l summary to the notification, or by providing this informati on upon request from a receiving provider. Response : We a gree wi th commenters that diagnosi s is an important d ata element to share dur ing care tra nsitions. However, our intention for this proposa l has been to set a minimal floor for pati ent event notifications, allowing for significan t flexibility, in recognition of the wide variety of ways that providers are currently implementing patien t event notifications. We are concerne d that the proposed requirement to include diagnosis could introduce unne cessary burden for hospitals that will be seeking to satisfy this requirement util izing the most basic informati on available i n an ADT message to support patient event notifications. As a result, we are not finalizing a requirement that diagnosis must be included in patient event notifications at 42 CFR 482 .24(d)(2), 482.61(f)(2), and 485.638(d)(2). We wish to reiterate that this final policy in no way precludes hospitals from including additional information, such as diagnosis, in a patient event notification. We a l so note that hospitals are required to send other necessary medica l information to receiving providers under the hospital CoP on Discharge Planning at 42 CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 328 CFR 482.43 . In addition, certain clinical information such as diagnosis is include d in the summary of care record which hospitals must be capable of transferring e lectronically in order to meet the health in forma tion exchange measures under the Promoti ng Interoperabilit y Program. Comment: Several commenters suggested CMS require hospitals to include additional informational elements i n pa tient event notifications, suc h as: discharg e disposition; chief complaint ; medication profile ; insurance policy c overage information ; additiona l information about the hospital, suc h as address and tax ID; contact information for a variety of resources such as social services a genci es and legal assistanc e providers; and other infor mation that can be used for patient matching. Commenters believe that additiona l information would have a positive impact on care coordination. Other commenters supporte d the proposal to require only a limited data set. One commenter recommended that CMS impose additiona l parameters on the information included as part of p atient event notifications, including a requirement that data must be recent and relevant to patient care. Response : We a ppreciat e commenters' suggestions, and agree that thi s additional informati on can have a positive impact on care coordination, patient matching, and other requirements. However, we do not believe that this information should be required withi n the CoPs for patient event notifications . We have heard from many stakeholders that even patient event notifications with extremel y limited information ca n have a pos itive effect on care coordination when they are delivere d in a timely manner . In addition, we understa nd that hospitals are currently delivering patient event notifications w ith widely varying sets of information. Finally, we note that hospitals are require d to send other necessar y medical informati on to receivi ng providers under the hospital CoP on Discharge Planning at 42 CFR 482.43. While we decline to require additional data a t thi s time, to ensure t hat hospitals a re able CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 329 to s atisfy the requirement with min ima l effort, we encourage hospitals to conside r other i nformati on that can be added to patient event notifications to support care coordination. Comment : Many commenters suggested that CMS work with ONC to add a certification criterion or a condition of certification related to the transmission of patient event notifications under ONC's certification program . Many commenters stated that hospitals should not be required to comply wit h the propose d requirements until the y have had an opportunit y to adopt certified technology supporti ng these requirements. Commenters believed this would assure hospitals that their systems are complian t with the proposed requirements. More over, commenters expressed concern that without complementary regulation directed toward health IT developers, the burden for ensuring these technical capabilities would rest on hospital providers alone. Some commenters suggeste d that ONC should als o include data elements related to patien t event notifications in the U SCDI, or se ek to standardize notification data elements in another way, to ensure that notifications can be r eceived by other EHR systems. Commenters also pointe d to a variety of emergi ng initiatives which focus on barriers t o informati on exchange, such as TEFCA, policies to address informati on blocking, and updates t o API technology under the ONC certification program. Commenters urged CMS to leverage these initiatives to advance the use of patient event notifications , for instance, by incorporating patient event notification functionality through the networks established as part of TEFCA. Response: We appreciate commenters' input. As we noted in the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access pr oposed rule, there is currently no c ertification c riterion specific to creating and sending electronic patien t event notifications included in ONC's certification progra m (84 FR 7651) . While ONC monitors the development of consensus standards for patient event notifications as part of i ts ISA (https://www.healthit.gov/isa/admission-discharge-and-transfer), CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 330 ONC has not yet proposed to develop a certification criterion based on any of these standards. Instead of focusing on the use of a specific certificati on criterion, we have sought to allow hospitals flexibilit y in how they satisfy the proposed CoP. We believe this is consistent with curren t pra ctices around patien t event notifications that have been implemented in a wide variety of ways across hospitals. We appreciate that many ot he r policy ini tiatives may intersec t with how hospitals implemen t patient event notification requirements. While we believe that providers will be able to implemen t patien t event notifications based on existing systems and infrastructure, we believe that many of the initiatives commenters mentioned will he lp to enable and enhance notificati on capabilities as they are introduced. Comment : A numbe r of commente rs stated that the proposal would disproportionately burden rural and critical access hos pitals. Commenter s noted that provider s in these settings may not have an E HR system, or may be unable to upgrade to the newest edition of certified technol ogy. For small and rural provider s that do have an E HR sys tem, commenters expressed concern about the implementation costs providers would need to incur as they wor k with their EHR vendors to depl oy new functionality. Commenters noted that, while working with an intermediary could substantiall y reduce the burden associate d with this proposal, ma ny small and rural hospital s are operating in geographi c areas that ar e not yet served by enti ties such as health information exchange s that could serve as intermediaries, requiring these hospitals to dedicate significant resources t o developi ng a compliant solution. This lack of access to appropriate infrastructure would put smal l and rural hos p itals at disproportionate ris k of nonc ompliance with the CoP standard, despite the significant effects penalties for noncompliance may have on underserved communities. Several commenters raised concerns about t hese providers' ability to CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 331 shoulder compliance costs with the proposed requirements , and suggested CMS provide funding opportuniti es to the se hospitals to mitigate the potentia l burden associated with the proposal. Response : We a ppreciat e commenters' concern s about the impact of thi s proposal on small, rural, and critical access hos pitals (CAHs). We note that thos e hos pitals without an EHR syste m with the technical capacity to generate information for e lectronic patien t event notifications, define d as a system conformant with the ADT messaging standar d (HL7 2.5.1), will not b e subjec t to th is final rule. Furthermore, we believe that changes finalized in this rule will ease some of the potentia l compliance burden associated with the rule, and make it easier for these hospitals to comply successfully with the CoP standard. For example, our final policy extends the applicable d ate for the requirements as well as defining a more limited s et of a recipients to w hom hospitals must send notifications for the purposes of compliance with the CoP. Comment: Many commenters no ted that patient event notifications are most effective when they take into account receiving providers' preferences . Commenters noted that recipients need flexibility to determine the information that they want to be notified about, the frequency of notificati on delivery, and how they would like notifications delivered; otherwise providers may expe rienc e \"signal fatigu e\" due to receiving an excessive number of messag es that do not contain i nformati on the provider finds useful. Commenters expresse d concer n that, under the proposed requirements, hospitals would not have flexibility to take into account receiving providers' preferences for receiving patient event notifications. They further believed that the proposed requirements would result in hospitals sending information to all providers regardless of their interest in receiving notifications, while implementation experience has shown that notifications CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 332 are more successful when receiving providers can request the information they would like to receive. Response : We a ppreciat e commenters' concern s about the importanc e of incorporating pr ovide r recipients ' preferences w hen implementing patient notification systems. We understand from stakeholders that a key feature of successfu l patient event notification implementations is flexibility with r espec t to the manne r in which notifications are delivered, to allow for better a lignment with ind ividua l providers ' workflows. Withou t such fle xibility, providers are more likely not to find notification systems useful, reducing their effectiveness to improve care coordination. We not e that under the proposed requirement, hospital systems must send patient notifications in accordance with the proposed requirements . However, this would not preclude hospitals, working eithe r directly with providers or through an intermediary, from ta iloring the delivery of patient notifications in a manner consistent with individual provider preferences. For instance, while a ho spital' s system must be able to send notification s at both admission and discharge, as well as a t the time of registration in the emergency department, if a specific provider prefers only to receive notifications upon discharge , nothing would prevent the hospital from limiting the notifications s ent to that provide r accordingly. We note that our revise d regulati on text states that hospitals must send notifications to those recipients that \"need to receive notification of the patient's status for treatment, care coordination, or quality improvement purposes.\" We believe that this standard will allow hospitals the discretion to determine which recipients ne ed to receive notifications, for instance, by declining to send certain notifications where a practitioner has stated that such notifications are n ot necessary or effectiv e for supporting care coordination. In cases w here t he hospital has CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 333 partnered with an intermediary to delive r notifications, the intermediary may e xercise this discretion on beha lf of a hos pital. C omment: Many commenters supporte d the proposal to allow use of an intermediary to delive r patient event notifications. C ommenters stated that use of an i ntermediary cou ld reduce operationa l bur den on hospitals by maintaining recipient information, supporting more effective patient matching, and delivering notifications i n accordance with receiving providers' preferences. C ommenters poi nted to numerous examples of how intermediaries , such as health information exchanges, are successfully facilitating the delivery of more complete a nd accurate patien t event notifications from today. Response : We thank commenters for their suppo rt and agree that the use of intermediaries to deliver patient notifications can reduce burden on hospitals and support effective notification s ystems. Comment: Several commenters sought additional information on our proposals with respect to the use of an intermediary, and whether exclusive use of an intermediary, provided other requirements are met, woul d satisfy the CoP. Commenters stated that they believe hospitals should be able to exclusively make use of an intermediary. Other commenter s suggested that CMS should \"deem\" a hospita l complian t with the CoP if they demonstrate that they a re using an intermediary to de live r notifications, as long as the intermediary has not been found to violate informati on blocki ng rules. Response: In the CMS Interoperability a nd Patient A ccess pr oposed rule, we stated that, if finalize d, hospitals would be required to send notifications \"directly or through an intermediary that facilitat es exchange of health information.\" We believe this w ould allow exclusive u se of either meth od, or a combination of these methods, provided other requirements CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 334 of the CoP are met. For instance, if a hospita l makes exclusive use of an intermediary to satisfy the CoP, the hos pita l would s till be subjec t to the requirement that notifications must be sent to the set of r ecipients we are finalizing in this rule, specifically all applicable post-acute care servic es pr ovider s and supplier s as well as a patients' primary care practitioner s or practice groups and entities primaril y responsible for a patient's care, as well as practitioners identified by the pa tient. Given this requirement, e xclusive use of an intermediary with a limited a bility to deliver notifications to the specified set of recipients, for instanc e an intermediary which restricts its delive ry to only those providers within a specific integrated healt h care system, would not satisfy the CoP. A lternatively, if a hospita l demonstrates that an intermediary c onnects to a wide range of recipients and does not impose restrictions on which recipient s are able to receive notifications through the intermediary, exclusive use of such an intermediary w ould satisfy the CoP. C omment: Commenters sought additional information on whether it would be permissible for a hos pital to delegate responsibility for making a determination about the existenc e of a patient' s care relationships to an intermediary that facilitate s delivery of a patient notification. Response : In the CMS Interoperability and Patient A ccess pr oposed rule we discussed a variety of methods through which hospitals can identify recipients for patient notifications, including through partnering wit h intermediaries such as health information exchanges (84 FR 7652). We r eiterat e that we believe this is one way that hospital s are currently identifyin g recipients for notifications, and that using an intermediar y to do so may reduce operational burden for hospitals. Thus, hospitals would be permitted to delegate this authority. CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 335 Comment : Severa l commenters requested additiona l information on whether ACOs would be entitled t o receive patient event notifications. Commenters stated that ACOs represent groups of providers and suppliers and work directly on their behalf. Therefore , it was unclear whether they would be considered intermediaries or providers and suppliers for the purposes of the proposed CoP. Commenters stated that patient event notifications are used by many ACOs today, and that ACOs both receive notifications directly from hospitals and thr ough other intermediari es such as health information exchanges. Response: We note that the proposed CoP does not create an entitlement for any specific provide r or intermediary to re ceive patien t event notifications. Rather, it requires hos pitals to demonstrate that their medical records system sen ds patient event notifications in a manner compliant with the proposed requirements . We believe there is nothing in the proposed requirement s that would prevent ACO s that have busine ss associat e relationships wi th the intended primary c are practitione r or practice group or entity from receiving patien t event notifications on behalf of that practitioner, gr oup, or entity s o long as their business associate agreement allows them to fulfil l that role. Comment: Several commenters suggeste d that CMS should deve lop a mechanis m for allowing community providers to report that they have not received notifications from a given hospital, or that the notifications received are incomplete or unreasonably delayed. Commenters believ e that such a mechanism would ensure pa tient event notification systems are functiona l and help to e stablish delivery parameters a cross a community. Response : We a ppreciat e commenters' input, but ar e unclear her e as to whether the commenters are requesting that w e develop a regulatory mechanism within the C oP provisions to allow for a community provider to report to a hospital any issues it may be experiencing with the CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 336 hospital's notification syste m or if t he reques t is for CMS to develop some other type of mechanism to accomplish this, such as an incentive- based payment mechanism as a means of encouraging a hospital to include this reporting function as part of its notification system . If it is the latter typ e of request, t hen such a mechanism would be outside the scope of the CoPs and this section of the rule. However, if it i s the former t ype of request, we wi ll consider these ideas as we evaluat e future upd ates and revisions to the CoPs with regard to patient event notifications. Comment: We proposed that a hospital would only need t o send not ifications to those practitioners for whom the hospital has reasonable certainty of receipt (84 FR 7652) . We further explained that we expected hospitals would, to the best of their ability, seek to ensure that notification recipient s were able to receive notifications, but that w e recognized that factors outside of the hospital's contro l may determine whethe r or not a notification was successfully received and utilized by a practitioner. Many commenters stated that a standard of \"reasonable certainty\" would hold hospitals responsible for factors outside of their control that prevent delivery of notifications, a nd that hospitals should only be held accountable for transmission of information, not receipt. Commenters stated that i t w ould be very difficul t for hospi tals to obtain reasonable certainty given the limitations of the infrastructure that is currently available for sharing health information. Several commenters b elieved that the phrase \"reasonabl e certainty\" would impos e a new affirmative du ty to validate receipt of no tifications, w hich w ould resul t in significant additiona l administrative burden for hos pitals. Severa l commenters suggested that CMS replace the term \"reasonable certainty\" with alternative s such as \"reasonable e ffort\" or \"reasonable confidence.\" They believed these alternative standards would better reflect actions wi thin the hospital's control. CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 337 Response: We appreciate commenters' feedback. In proposing that hospitals send notifications to thos e practitioners for whom the hospita l has reasonabl e certainty of receipt, w e sought to adapt a similar standard currently id entified in guidance for the Promoting Int eroperability P rogram (see https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and- Guidance/Legislation/EHRIncentivePrograms/Downloads/MedicareEH_2019_Obj2-.pdf ) regarding the expectations of participants in that progra m when the y t ransfe r a summary of care recor d to another provider. However, we concur with commenter s that a standard of \"reasonable certainty,\" while appropriate for the Promoting Interoperability P rogram, in which participants are require d to use certified technology for the transmissi on and receipt of summar y of care documents , may not be appropriate in the context of this proposal, which permits flexibilit y in both the technology used to send and receive patient event notifications and the format of the notification itself. We agree th a t a standard that be tte r reflects actions within the hospital's control would be much more appropriate in this circumstance. Accordingly, we are revising our final policy (at 42 CFR 482.24( d)(5), 482.61(f)(5), and 485.638(d)(5)) to now require that a hospita l (or a CAH ) must demons trate that it \"has made a reasonable e ffort to ensur e that\" the syste m sends the notifications to any of the following that need to receive notification of the patient's status for treatment, c are coordination, or quality improvemen t purposes to all appli cable p ost-acute c are services p rovider s and supplier s and: (1) the patient's established primary care pr actitioner ; (2) the patient's established primary care practice group or entity; or (3) other practitioner, or other practice group or entity, identifi ed by the patient as the practitioner, or practice group or entity, primarily responsible for h is or her care. We believe that t his modified standard will provide hospitals and CAHs with appropriate flexibility and can accoun t for the constraints o f providers' existing systems. We also believe CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 338 that this modified s tandard takes into account the fact that some recipients may not be able to receive patient event notifications, or may not be able to receive notifications in a manner consist ent with a hospital system's capabilities, and the fact that hospitals and CAHs may not be able to ide ntify provide r recipients for some patients. We expec t that surveyors will evaluate whether a hospital is making a reasonable effort to send patient event notifications while working within the constraints of its existing technology infrastructure. Comment : Several commenters of fered their assessment s of readin ess acros s hos pitals to implemen t patien t event notifications. One commente r pointed to hospitals' high levels of engagement in some form of he alth informati on exchange as an indication that hospitals are well-positioned to distribute patient event notifications , and state d that establishing ADT- based notificati on feeds did not impose significant burdens on hospitals. Another commenter agreed that the technica l capabilities to implement notifications exists today, and stated that the primary challenge for hospitals would be in updating business and operational practices to comply. Other commenters stated that functionality to use ADT message information for patient event notifications is not part of certified electronic health record technology and that not all EHR s are capable of generating not ifications. They stated that EHR s are not able to a utomatic ally send and receive notification s and cautioned CMS against oversimplifying the development burden associated with implementation. One commenter suggested that CMS should provide supplemental fundi ng to support hospitals' costs, workflow changes, and technical expertise a ssociated with implementation. Response : We thank commenters for their insights. We share the assessment of commenters who stated that most hos pitals will be able to implemen t patient event notifications with minima l burden due to the widespread adoption of technology systems that can be utilized CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 339 to support generating and sending these notifications. Patient event notifications have been widely recognized as an important way to support patient safety, by enabling providers and suppliers responsible for the post-discharge care of a patient to quickly initiate care coordination protocols that can mitigate the risk of deterioration of a patient's condition following a hospital stay. We un derstand some commenters' concerns that the ability to send patient event notifications has not been include d as a capability certified under the ONC certification program, and that there is no widely adopted, uniform approach to sending patient event notifications at this time. However, as noted by many commen ters, we believe ther e are a wide variety of available, low-cost solutions that providers can adopt to fulfil l the minima l requirements described i n this final rule. Accordingly, we have provided significant flexibilit y for providers to meet these requirements by not including additional technical specifications about how patient event notifications must be formatted and shared. We believe that thi s approach allow s flexibility for hospitals to e stablish patien t event notifications that meet the requirements i n ways that minimize implementation burden; however, we recognize that the lack of a uniform approach may lead to instan ces w here a p rovider i s unable to receive notifications sent by a hospital in a seamless, interoperable fashion. Comment : Commenters stated that nationa l infrastructure for he alth inf ormation exchange was not yet mature enough to support the widespread implementation of patient event notifications and that successfu l implementation of notifications requires the ability to acquire data feeds and a rules engine to support alerting routing and delivery, as well as a patient index function to create and verify patient panels. While many commenters believed that this infrastructure migh t be available in the future, for instance, through establ ishment of the TEFCA, they stated that it i s not ubiquitous today. Withou t this infrastructure, commenters noted that CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 340 providers would be require d to support a large number of po int-to-point interfaces with other pr oviders that lack scalability, and will be highl y costl y, inefficient , and burdensome to develop and maintain. One commente r recommended th at CMS establish that, for compliance purposes, a hospital would only be require d to demonstrate a notificati on has been sent for a single patient. This would a llow surveyors to confi rm th a t the syste m is functiona l while allowing for variation across hospitals depending on their capabilities to send notifications unde r different circumstances. One commenter suggeste d that CMS should focus on incentivizing providers to participate in existing scalable networks that support health informati on exchange, including patien t event notifications. Response: We agree with commenters that the national health information exchange infrastructure to suppor t patien t event notifications is not yet ubiquitous . However, we believe that the health information inf rastructure that exists today will be sufficient to provide substantial support for the requirements we are finalizi ng in this rule. As other commenters noted, organizations such as health information exchanges are supporti ng the sharing of patient event notifications in many areas today. While we unde rstand there is variation in availability of this infrastructure, we bel iev e ther e are options increasingly available for hos pitals to implement basic patient event notifications that will allow hospitals to demonstrate t hey have made a \"reasonable effort \" to en sure their system sends the r equired notifications, as pe r the policy finalized in t his final rule. We a ppreciat e the suggestion that the CoP should specif y a hospital could achieve compliance through demonstrati ng that a notification has been sent for a single patient, and that this w ould ease c omplianc e concern s expressed by stakeholders. However, we believe that these concerns are addressed through the more limited standard in our final policy that requires a CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 341 hospital (or CAH) to make a \"reasonable e ffort\" to ensure that its system sends these notifications. In addition, and as previously noted, survey a nd certificati on interpretive gui delines utilize a v ariety of approache s to eva luat e whether a hos pital has satisfied the CoP, and in this final rule we decline to e mploy overly prescriptive regulatory language that might significantly limit options for surveyors as they assess c o mpliance. Comment : Many commenters identified challenge s related to the proposal tha t a hospital demonstrate that its system sends notifications to licensed and qualified practitioners, other patient car e team members, and post-acute care services providers and suppliers meeting certain conditions (84 FR 7651) . Commenters stated that the proposal seemed t o require a hospital to be able to send a notification to any other health care provider and assume d that the receiving provider would have the technologica l capabilities to receive this information. Commenters stated that this is not realistic given the current state of technology adoption among receiving providers, and that recipients would need to develop capabilities to receive, incorporate, and use these no tifications for the proposal to be effective. Commenters stated that, today, notifications would only be likely t o reach recipients only a percentage of the tim e citing many factors related to the limitations of EHR technology that prevent providers and clinicians from inc orporating electronic information into their EHRs. For instance, commenter s noted that EHR s must b e able to conf identially m atch transferred data to a patient, incorporate the notification into the EHR, and ensure that it is reviewed and stored in a clinically appropriate way to ensure it is effectively used. Commenters stated that CMS should conside r complementary requirements and/o r supports for ambulatory and other facilities to ensure they are able to receive patient even t notifications provided by hospitals. Commenters requested additional information on the expectations for receiving providers to successfully CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 342 receive and incorporate patient event notifications, and noted they may face significant burden associated with technical development if expected to be able to receive these notifications. Moreover , commenters expresse d concerns about the capacity of specific providers, including small and rural phys ician practices and post- acute care provider s and suppliers, to receive patient event notifications. Commenters specifically noted that pos t-acute care providers were not provided financial incentives unde r the HITECH, and therefore many post- acute c are providers are not using EHRs or are using EHRs that are not able to exchange information with hospital EHRs. Several commenters recommended that CMS not hold hospitals accountable for delivering patien t event notifications to post- acute care suppliers, given the difficulties these suppliers would have in receiving these notifications. Others stated that the inability of these providers to receive notifications would limit the effectiveness of the proposed requirements. Response : We a ppreciat e commenter s input on this i ssue. In t he CMS Interoperability and Pa tient Access pr oposed rule, we stated that a hospital subject to the proposed r equirements must demonstrate that its syste m sends notifications to certain recipients. We do not expec t that a hospita l would \" demonstrate\" that its syste m meets these requirements through meeting a comprehensive measur e of performance. L ikewise, we would not expect a hospital's system to be capable of electronically communicating with every possible provider, facility, or practitioner system, or of satisfying every pos sible preference for delivery of patient event notifications that a provider , facility, or practitioner might attempt to impose on the hospital. As noted above, we are modifying our proposal to require that a hospital makes a \"reasonable effort\" to ensure that its system sends patient event notifications to the specified recipients. Under the survey and certification process we would expect a hospital to demonstrate its system's c ompliance w ith the C oP in a variety of ways, subject to the system's c apabilities. For CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 343 instance, if a given system sends notifications via Direct messaging, we might expect surveyors to review whether the hospital ha s a process i n p lace for capturing D irect addresse s of patients' primary care practitioner s to enabl e the system to send patient event notification s to these recipients. Finally, with regard to comments about PAC services providers and suppliers that we re not eligible for incentives for EHR adoption under the EHR Incentive Programs established by the HITECH Act, we again note th at the requirements in this final rule are limited t o only those hospital s and CAH s that po ssess a nd utilize EHR or other administrativ e system s with the technica l capacity to ge nerate information for electronic patient event notifications. Moreover, a hospital or CAH with such a syste m must only demonstrate that it has made a \"reasonable effort\" to e nsure that its syste m sends notifications to any of the specified recipients, including all applicable post-acute care services p rovider s and supplier s (that is, to those PAC services providers and suppliers to whom the patien t is being transferred or referred). Comment: In the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access proposed rule, we did not explicitly address the effective implementation date for the proposed revisions to the CoPs. However, we note that revisions to t he CoPs are generally applicable 60 days from the publication of a final rule. Many commenters recommended CMS allow additional time for implementation beyond the usual applicable da te of the se revisions. C ommenters stated that additiona l time was required to allow providers to complete technical upgrades and trai n staff on new workflows . One commenter suggested that CMS finali ze different timeframes based on whether hospital s are in an area w ith existing infrastructure for transmitting patien t event n otifications. Another CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 344 commenter suggeste d that CMS develop working groups to determine appropriate timelines for implementation. Response: We agree with commenters that additional time would be appropr iate for hospitals and CAHs to implement the proposed requirements. Therefore , we are finalizing that the requirements w il l be applicable 6 months after the publication date of this final rule. Comment : Multiple commenters addressed privacy implications of the proposed requirements. Commenters sought clarity on whether patient consent would be required to send a patient event notification, or whether hospitals would be able to honor a patient's request to opt- out of sharing information with providers in the form of a patient event notification. Commenters urged CMS to issue further guidanc e about privacy and security challeng es associated with sending patient event notifications , for instance , how hospitals should address cases where they cannot confirm the identity of a provider, and/or where transmission could risk improper disclosure of protected healt h information. Several commenters suggested that concerns about noncompliance could lead some hospitals to be overly hasty in sendi ng patient event notifications without considering the privac y impact of the transmission, potentially leading to inappropriate disclosures of information. R esponse: We appreciate commenters' concerns about preserving patient privacy. Nothing in this proposed rule should be constru ed to supersed e hos pitals' complianc e with HIPAA or other state or federal laws and regulations relate d to the privacy of patient information. We note that hospitals would not be require d to obtain patient consent for sending a patien t event notification for treatment, care coordination, or quality improvement purposes as described in thi s final policy. However, w e also recognize that it is important for hospitals to be able to honor p atient p references to not s hare thei r information. While the CoP would require CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 345 hospitals to demonstrate that their systems can send patient event notifications, we do not intend to pr even t a hospita l from recording a patient's reques t to not share th ei r information with another provider, and, where consistent with other law, re strict the delivery of notifications as requested by the patient and consistent with the individual right to request restriction of uses and disclosures established in the HIPAA Privacy Rule. Similarly, if a hospita l is working w ith an intermediary to de live r patien t event notifications, the intermediary may record information about a patient's preferences for how their informati on is shared, and, where consistent with other law, restrict the delivery of notifications accordingly. Based on commenters' concerns regarding a patient's a bility to reques t that his or her me dical information (in the form of a patien t event notification) is not shared w ith other settings, we are revising and finalizing a requiremen t in thi s rule that a hospita l (or CAH) must demonstrate that its notification system sends notifications, \"to the extent permissibl e under applicable federal and state law and regulations and not inconsistent with t he patient' s expressed privacy p references.\" Regarding i mprope r disclosure of health inform ation where a hospital cannot confirm the identity of a receiving provider, we note that under this policy a hospital would not be unde r any obligation to send a patient event notificati on in this case. Under our f inal policy, hospitals would be require d to make a \"reasonable e ffort\" to ens ure their systems s end notifications to the specified recipients. We believ e this standard will account for instan ces in which a hos pital (or its intermediary) ca nnot identify a n appropriate recipient for a patient event notification despite establishing processes for identifying re cipients, and thus is unable to send a notification for a given patient. Comment: Many commenters raised concerns about how hospitals would be able to implement the proposed patient event notifications w hile c omplying with state a nd federal laws CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 346 and regulations around the transmission of sensitive data. Commenters noted these issues are particularly relevant f or psychiatric hospitals included in the proposal. Commenters noted that som e states have more stringent privacy and consent requirements that apply to individuals treated in mental health facilities w hich may impact the s ending of patient event notifications. One commenter noted that hospitals with behavioral health units do not disclose patient event information as part of t heir primary system d ata feed due to requirements that d isclosure of this information must be accompanied by written consent. Commenters also noted that appropriately segregating this data is expensive and time consuming. Response: Nothing in this requirement should be construed as conflicting with hospitals' ability to comply with laws and regulations restricting the sharing of sensitive information. While hospitals subject to the CoP would need to demonstrate their system sends notifications to appropriate recipients, hospitals would not be expected to share patient information through a notification unless they have obtained any consents necessary to comply with existing laws and regulations. Comment : Many commenters su pported the proposal to require a hospital's system demonstrate that it sends patient e vent n otifications a t the time of admission, and at, or just p rior to, the time of discharge. Commenters emphasized tha t it is important f or notification information to be timely in order for it to be effective in improving care coordination. One commenter stated that s ome providers find tha t notifications triggered by an ADT message are triggered too early, prior to the availability of a discharge summary, and sough t additional information about whether hospitals may use other triggers for a patient event notification. Response: We a ppreciate c ommenters' support for the p roposal. We b elieve p atient event notifications are most u sefu l when tied to admission (or registratio n, as is the term generally used CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 347 for patient s seen in the ED) and discharge events, as receiving ne ar -real time information a bou t a patient's hospitalization can ensure receiving providers, facilities, and practitioners are able to act quickly to ensure successful car e coordination. While we a gree that sending availabl e clinical informati on along with a patient event notification can be helpful, we believe that delaying notifications until all of t he inf ormation about a patient's hospitalization is availabl e would likely decrease the value of the notification. Comment : Several commenters s uggested that the requirements s hould be limited to external providers a nd not include provider s that may sha r e the same EHR as the hos pital a s part of an integrated deliver y system. Commenters noted that organizations may have other ways to notif y these providers about a discharge, and that hospitals should be exempt from sending notifications to the se providers. Response : Under th e proposed requirements, we are not specify ing a forma t or tra nsport method for patient event notifications. Accordingly, hospitals could use a mix of approaches to delive r patient event notifications, for ins tance, by pa rtnering with an intermediary to deliver notifications to external providers, w hile using features interna l to a shared E HR syste m to transmi t inf ormation to pr oviders that are part of the same organization. Comment : Severa l commenters sought clarity o n how the patien t event notifications would relate to information blocki ng policy, a nd urged CMS to ensure that any new CoP requirements are aligned with other policies around information blocking. Severa l c ommenters suggeste d that, as an alternative to the proposed requirements, CMS should establish a standard under the CoPs that states hospitals will not engage in information blocking, to be aligned with policies established by ONC in the 21st Century Cures Act f inal r ule. CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 348 Response : We not e that there are currently three preventi on of information blocking attestation statements unde r 42 C FR 495.40( b)(2)(i)(I)( 1) through ( 3) to which eligible hospitals and CAHs must attest for purposes of the Promoting Interoperability Program. As part of successfully demonstrating that an eligible hospital or CAH is a meaningful EHR user for purposes of the Promoting Interoperability Program, the eligible hospita l or CAH must submi t an attestation respons e of \"yes\" for each of these statements. These attestations are discussed further in s ection VIII. of this final rule. We also re fer com menters to section 3022(b)(2)(B ) of the P ublic Health Service Act (PHSA), which provides that any healt h care provider determined by the OIG to have committed information blocki ng shall be referred t o the appropriate agency to be subject to a ppropriate disincentives using authorities under a pplicable federa l la w, as set forth by the Secretar y through notice and comment rulemaking. Further, we refer commenters to the ONC 21st Century Cures Act proposed rule for additional discussion on disincentives (84 FR 7553). Final Action : After consideration of the comments received, and for the reasons outlined in our response to these comments and in the CMS Interoperabilit y and Patient Access proposed rule, we are finalizing these proposals with some modifications and reorganization of the provisions . These policies are being finalize d at 42 CFR 482.24(d), 482.61(f), and 485.638(d) for Conditions of Participation for hospitals, psychiatric hospitals, and specialized providers (CAHs). Based on public comments, and t o further advance electronic exchange of information that supports effective transitions of care for patients between hospitals and CAHs and their community PAC services providers and suppliers as well a s their p rimary care practitioners, the CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 349 following requirements at 42 CFR 482.24(d), 482.61(f), and 485.638(d) are being finalized here with modifications and reorganization from the proposed requirements (84 FR 7678): We are revising 42 CFR 482.24(d) by referen ce to \"paragraph this section\"; We are revising 42 CFR 482.61(f) by deleting the reference to \"paragraph (d)(2) of this section\"; We are revising 42 CFR 485.638(d) by deleting the reference to \"paragraph (d)(2) of this section\"; We are r evising 42 CFR 482.24(d) by adding new language to the regulatory text so that it now includes \"or other electronic administrative system, which is conformant with the content exchange standard at 45 CFR 170.205(d)(2),\"; We are revising 42 CFR 482.61(f) by adding new language to the regulatory text so that it now includes \"or other electronic administrative system , which is conformant with the content exchange standard at 45 CFR 170.205(d)(2),\"; We are revising 42 CFR 485.638(d) by adding new language to the regulatory text so that it now includes \"or other electronic administrative system, which is conformant with the content exchange standard at 45 CFR 170.205(d)(2),\"; We are deleting all of the regulatory text proposed at 42 CFR 482.24(d)(2), 482.61(f)(2), and 485.638(d)(2), including the inaccurate 482.61(f)(2), and 485.638(d)(2), respectively, and also revising the regulatory text CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 350 to now state that t he system sends notifications that must include at least patient name, treating practitioner name, and sending institution name; We are redesignating 42 482.61(f)(3), and 485.638(d)(3), respectively, and also revising the regulatory text to now state that, \" to the extent permissible under applicable federal and state law and regulations, and not inconsistent with the patient's expresse d privacy preferences, the system sends notifications directly, or through an intermediary that facilitates exchange of health information, at the time of: the patient's registration in the hospital's [ or CAH's ] emergency department (if applicable); or the patient's admission to the hospital's [or CAH's] inpatient services (if applicable). \" [emphasis added in italics for new regulatory text being finalized here]; We are redesignating 42 482.61(f)(4), and 485.638(d)(4), respectively, and also revising the regulatory text to state that, \" to the extent permissible under applicable federal and state law and regulations, and not inconsistent with the patient's expressed privacy preferences, the system sends notifications directly, or through an intermediary that facilitates exchange of health information, at the time of: the patient's discharge or transfer from the hospital's [or CAH's] emergency department (if applicable): or the or transfer from the hospital's [or CAH's] inpatient services (if applicable). \" [emphasis added in italics for new regulatory text being finalized here] We are deleting the regulatory text proposed at 42 CFR 482.24(d)(5), 482.61(f)(5), and 485.638(d)(5) and adding new regulator y text t o state that, \" the hospital [or CAH] has made a reasonabl e effort to en s ure that the system send s the notifications to all applicable post -acute care services providers and suppliers, as w ell as to any of the following practitioners and CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 351 entities, which need to receive notification of the patient's status for treatment, care coordination, or quality improvement purposes: the patient's established primary care practitioner; the patient's established primary care practice group or entity; or other practitioner, or other practice group or entity, identified by the patient as the practitioner, or practice group or entity, primarily responsible for his or her care.\" [E mphasis added in italics for new r egulatory text being finalized here .] Finally, in response to the number of comments received regarding concerns with the applicability, date for this rule, we are establishing an applicability date of 6 months after finalization of this rule for hospitals, including psychiatric hospitals, and CAHs to allow for adequate and additional time for these institutions, especially small and/or rural hospitals as well as CAHs, to come into compliance with the new requirements. XI.Provisions of the Final Regulatio ns Generally, this final rule incorporates the provisions of the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access proposed rule as proposed. The following provisions of this final rule differ from the proposed rule. We are finalizing four proposals with modifica tions. 1.We are requiring MA organizations, Medicaid managed care plans, CHIP managed care entities, and QHP issuer s on the FFEs to m aintain a process for the electroni c exchange of, at a minimum, the data classes and element s included in the content and vocabulary standard finalized by HHS in the O NC 21st Century Cures Act final rule (published elsewher e in this issue of the Federal Register ) at 45 CFR 170.2 13 (currently version 1 of the USCDI), via a payer- to-payer data exchanged as outlined in this section V. of this final rule. Specifically, we are finalizing as proposed that impacted payers i ncorporate th e data they receive into the CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 352 enrol lee's record. We are finalizing that with the approva l and at the direction of a current or forme r enrollee, a paye r must send the defined in formation set to any other payer. I n addition, w e specif y that a payer is only obligate d to send data received from a nother payer unde r this policy in the e lectronic form and forma t it was received. Starting January 1, 2022, and for QHP issuers on the FFEs starting with plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2022, the finalized regulation requires these payers to make data available with a date of service on or after January 1, 2016 that meets the requirements of this section a nd which the payer maintains. In this way, payers only have to prepare an initial historica l set of data for sharing via this payer -to-payer data exchange policy t hat is consistent with the data set to be availabl e through the Patient A ccess API, as finalized i n sect ion III. of this final rule. 2. R egarding the Patient Access A PI, we are finalizing requirement s for MA organizations, Medicai d and CHIP FFS programs, Medicai d managed care plans, CHIP managed care entities, and QHP issuer s on the FFEs to i mplement and maintain a standards -based Patient Access A PI that meet s the technical standards as finalized by HHS in the ONC 21st Century Cures A ct final rule (published elsewher e in this issue of the Federal Register ) at 45 CFR 170.215, that include the data elements specified in this final rule, a nd that perm it th ird -party applications to retrieve , with the approval and at the direction of a current enrollee, data specified at 42 CFR 422.119, 431.60, 457.730, and 45 CFR 156.221. Specifically, we are finalizing that the Patient Access A PI must, at a m inimum, make available adjudicated claims; encounter s with capitated providers ; provide r remittanc es; enroll ee cost-sharing; and clinical data, including laboratory results (where maintained by the impacted pa yer). We are not finalizing a requirement to include Provider D irectory information as part of the Patient A ccess API. Instead, to limit CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 353 burden, we are only requiring provider and, in the case of MA-PD plans, pharmacy directory information, be included in the Provide r Directory API discussed in section IV. of thi s final rule. Data via the Patient Acce ss API must be made availabl e no later than one ( 1) busines s day after a claim is adjudicated or encounter dat a are received by the impacted payer. We a re finalizing that MA organizations, Medicaid state agencies, Medicaid managed care plans, CHIP state agencies, and CHIP managed care entities must make available the date they maintain with a date of service on or after January 1, 2016 beginning January 1, 2021, and for QHP issuers on the FFEs beginning with plan years beginni ng on or after January 1, 2021. 3. We are finalizing a Provider Directory API for MA organizations, Medicaid state agencies, Medicaid managed care plans, CHIP state agencies, and CHIP managed care entities making standardized information about their provider networks available via a FHIR- based API c onformant with the te chnica l stand ards finalized by HHS in the ONC 21st Century C ures Act final rule (published elsewher e in this issu e of the F ederal Register) at 45 CFR 170.215 (which include HL7 FHIR Release 4.0.1) , excluding the security protocols related to user authentication and aut horization, or any other protocols that restric t the availability of thi s information to anyone wishing to access it. At a minimum, these payers must make available via the Provider Directory API provider names, addresses, phone numbers, and s pecialties. F or MA organizations that offer MA-PD plans, they must als o make available, at a minimum, pharmacy directory data, including the pharmac y name, address, phone number, number of pha rmacies in the network, and mix (specifically the type of pharmacy, such as \"retail pharmacy\"). This Provide r Directory API m ust be fully implemented by January 1, 2021 for all payers subject to this new requirement. Under this final rule, MA organizations, Medicaid and CHIP FFS programs, Medicaid managed care plans, and CHIP managed car e entities m ust mak e the Provider CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 354 Directory API accessibl e via a pub lic-facing digital endpoint on their website to ensure public discovery and access. Modifications being finalized for the timelines for these policies will provide impacted payers ample time to build and test the require d standards-based APIs to meet the new API requirements. In addition, providing more time for payer-to-payer data exchange between impacted payer s will ensure s uccessful implementation, and better enable plans to use a standards-based API to meet this requirement if they so choose. We are not finalizi ng the Care Coordination through Truste d Exchange Networks proposal. Although some commenters did show support for the proposal, others raised strong concerns. G iven the concerns commenter s raised specifically regarding the need for a mature TEFCA to be in place first, and appreciating the ongoing work on the TEFCA being done at this time, we are not finalizing this trusted exchange proposal in this rule. 4. We are finalizing the Revisions to the Conditions of Participation for Hospitals and Critical Acc ess H ospital s proposal with modifications that ar e based on publi c comments. Additionally, and base d on strong support from commenters , we are including patient event notification requirement s for any patient who accesses s ervic es in a hos pital (or CAH) emergency department. In response to the number of comments receive d regardi ng concerns with the a pplicable date for this policy, we are finalizing an applicability date of 6 months after publ ication of this rule for hospitals, including psychiatric hospitals, and CAHs to allow for adequat e time for these institutions, especially small and/or rural hospital s as w ell as CAHs, to come into compliance with the new requirements. All other policies are being substantiall y finalized as proposed. XII. Collection of Information RequirementsCMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 355 Under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, we are required to provide 30-day notice in the Federal Register and solicit public c omment before a collection of information requirement is submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and approval. In order to fairly evaluate whether an information collection should be approved by OMB, section 3506(c)(2)(A) of the P aperwork Reduction Act of 1995 requires that we solicit comment on the following issues: The need for the information collection and its usefulness in carrying out the proper functions of our agency. The accuracy of our estimate of the information collection burden. The quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected. Recommendations to minimize the information collection burden on the affected public, including automated collection techniques. We solicited public comment on each of these issues for the following sections of this document that contain information collection requirements (ICRs): A.Background Payers should have the ability to exchange data instantly with other payers for care and payment coordination or transitions, and with providers to facilitate more efficient care. Payers are in a unique position to provide patients a complete picture of th eir claims and encounter data, allowing patients to piece together their own information that might otherwise be lost in disparate systems. To advance our commitment to interoperability, we are finalizing our proposals for the Patient Access API, the Provi der Directory API, and the payer- to-payer data exchange as discussed above. We noted that these proposals were designed to empower patients by making sure that CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 356 they have access to health information about themselves in a usable digital format and can make decisions about how, with whom, and for what uses they will share it. By making claims data readily available and portable to the enrollee, these initiatives supported efforts to reduce burden and cost and improve patient care by reducing duplication of services, adding efficiency to patient visits to providers; and, facilitating identification of fraud, waste, and abuse. B. Wage Estimates To derive average costs, we used data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' (BLS) May 2018 National Occupational Employment and Wage Estimates (https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_nat.htm ). Table 1 presents the mean hourly wage, the cost of fringe benefits (calculated at 100 percent of salary), and the adjus ted hourly wage. In the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access proposed rule, Table 1 was based on the latest 2017 wage data (84 FR 7658). In this final rule, we have updated Table 1 to reflect 2018 wage data, which is now the latest available data. TABLE 1: Occupation Titles and Wage Rates Occupation Title Occupation Code Mean Hourly Wage ($/hr) Fringe Benefit ($/hr) Adjusted Hourly Wage ($/hr) Administrators and Systems Administrators 15-1142 Records and Health Information Technician Medical $109.36 As indi cated, we are adjusting the employee hourly wage estimates by a factor of 100 CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 357 percent. This is ne cessarily a rough adjustment, both becaus e fringe benefit s and overhead costs vary significantl y from employer to employer, and because methods of estimating these costs vary widel y from study to study. Nonetheless, there is no practical alternative and we believe that doub ling the hourly wage to estimate total cost is a reasonable accurate estimation method. C. Information Collection Requirements (ICRs) 1. ICRs Regarding MMA File Requirements ( 42 CFR 423.9 10) States trans mit s ystem generated data files, at least monthly, to CMS to identify all dually eligible individuals , including full- benefit and partial -benefi t dua lly eligible beneficiaries (that is, those who get Medicai d help with Medicare premiums , and often for cost-sharing). The file is called the MMA file, but is occasionally referred to as the \"State Phasedown file.\" Section 423.910(d) requir es states to transmit at least one MMA file each month. However, states ha ve the option to transmi t mu ltiple MMA files throughou t the month (up to one per day). Most states transmi t at least we ekly. This information collection activity is currently approved unde r OMB control number 0938- 0958. Ensuring information on dual eligibility status is accurate and up-to-date by increasing the frequency of federal -state data exchange is an important step toward interoperability. As a result, we proposed to update the frequency requirements in 42 CFR 423.9 10(d) to require that starting April 1, 2022, all states transmit the required MMA file data to CMS daily, and to make conformi ng edits to 42 CFR 423.910( b)(1). Dail y would mean every business day, but if no new transactions are available to transmit , data would not need to be transmitted on a given business day. We e stimat e it would take a computer system s analyst about 6 months (approximately 960 hours) to complete the system s upd ates ne cessary to proces s and transmit t he MMA data daily. After completion of system updates, th ese s ystem generated reports would be set to run and CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 358 transmitte d to CMS on an automated producti on schedule. As a result of upda te d information, we are revising the numbe r of s tates currently transmitting MMA daily data from 13 states, as stated in the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access proposed rule , to 15 states. Consequently, we estimate a one -time aggregate burden for 36 entities (51 total entities (50 states and the Distric t of C olumbia ) minus the 15 states currently transmitting M MA daily data) to comply with the requiremen t of transmission of daily MMA data at an aggregat e bur den of $3,111 ,091 (36 entities * 960 hours * $90.02 per hour f or a computer system analyst to perform the upda tes). We have only estimated the cost of system updat es since the system transfer s are done automatically and this has no additional cost. We w ill be revising the information collection request currently approved under 0938-0958 to include the requirement s discussed in this s ection. 2. ICRs Regarding promote our commitment to interoperabilit y, we are finalizing new requirements for a Patient Acce ss API for MA organizations at 42 CFR 422.11 9, Medicai d FFS at 42 CFR 431.60, CHIP FFS a t 42 CFR 457.730, Medicaid managed care at 42 CFR 438.242(b)(5), CHIP managed care at 42 CFR 457.123 3(d), QHP issuers on the FFEs at 45 CFR 156.221. Additionally, we are finalizing a publicly available Provide r Directory API for MA organizations at 42 CFR 422.120, at 42 CFR 431 .70 for Medicaid FFS, at 42 CFR 438.242(b)(6) for Medicai d managed care, at 42 CFR 457.760 for CHIP FFS, and at 42 CFR 457.12 33(d)(3) for CHIP managed care. We pr oposed to requir e these entitie s to establish standards- based APIs t hat permit third- party applications to retrieve standa rdized data for adjudicated cl aims, encounter s with capitated providers, provider remittances, beneficiary cost-sharing, reports of lab test r esults, provider CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 359 directories (and pharmacy directories for MA -PDs), and preferred drug lists, where applicable. We finalized the requirement for a Patient Access API and a Provider Directory API; this final rule requires generally the same information as proposed to be available through APIs but we are finalizing the requirement for two APIs. Additionally, we proposed and are finalizing at 42 CFR 422.119(f)(1) and 438.62(b)(1)(vi), and at 45 CFR 156.221(f)(1) to require MA organizations, Medicaid managed care plans, CHIP managed care entities, and QHP issuers on the FFEs to maintain a process for the electronic exchange of, at a minimum, the data classes and elements included in the content standard adopted at 45 CFR 170.213 (currently version 1 of the USCDI). To implement the new requirements for APIs and payer to payer data exchange, we estimate that plans and states will conduct three major work phases: initial design, development and testing, and long-term support and maintenance. In the proposed rule, we provided detailed estimations of the required labor categories and number of hours required to implement the API provisions (84 FR 7659). We originally estimated a one-time burden of $789,356.00 per organization or state per implementation, with an ongoing maintenance cost $158,359.00 per organization or state (84 FR 7659). We noted that, in the initial design phase, we believed tasks would include: determining available resources (personnel, hardware, cloud space, etc.); assessing whether to use in -house resources to facilitate an API connection or contract the work to a third party; convening a team to scope, build, test, and maintain the API; performing a data availability scan to determine any gaps between internal data models and the data required for the necessary FHIR resources; and, mitigating any gaps discovered in the available data. During the development and testing phase, we noted that plans and states would need to CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 360 conduct the following: map existing data to HL766 FHIR standards, which would constitute the bulk of the work required for implementation; allocate hardware for the necessary environments (development, testing, production); build a new FHIR server or leverage existing FHIR servers; determine the frequency and method by which internal data are populated on the FHIR server; build connections between the databases and FHIR server; perform capability and security testing; and vet third -party applications, which includes potentially asking third -party applications to attest to certain privacy provisions . After the completion of the API development, plans and states would need to conduct the following throughout each year: allocate resources to maintain the FHIR server, which includes the cost of maintaining the necessary patient data, and perform capability and security testing. In the proposed rule, we proposed a new requirement for MA plans, Medicaid managed care plans, CHIP managed care entities, and QHP issuers on the FFEs to maintain a process to coordinate care between plans by exchanging, at a minimum, the USCDI at the enrollee's request (84 FR 7640). Originally, we noted that w e would allow multiple methods for electronic exchange of the information, including use of the APIs. Although we considered requiring the use of the FHIR-based API, we understood that some geographic areas might have a regional health information exchange that could coordinate such transactions. We also noted other ways to exchange this data, such as: direct plan -to-plan exchange; leveraging connections to HIEs, or beneficiary -facing third -party applications. Since the requirements for the payer -to-payer d ata exchange and the API provisions share a content and vocabulary standard and because plans will 66 Healt h Level Seve n International (HL7\u00ae) is a not-for-profit, NSI- accredite d standards development or ganization ( SDO) focused on developing consensus standards for the exchange, i ntegration, sharing, a nd r etrieval of electronic healt h informati on that supports clinical pr actice and the management, d eliver y and evaluati on of health services. Learn more at \"About HL7\" web page, last accessed J une 27, 2018. CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 361 be investi ng in the development of the APIs in this final rule, we believe that plans would overwhelmingly use t hese APIs to meet the payer to payer data e xchang e requirements. As we had no reliable way to d etermine which plans would utilize any of the available methods to meet the payer-to-payer data exchange requirement or how to determine the cost of each of these methods, given that each plan could be at a different technology maturity level, we accounte d for costs for all impacted payer s assuming the use of a ne wly developed API to i mplement the payer- to-payer data exchange requirements , as this would account for a higher effort options, and include d this in our orig ina l estimates for the API provisions. We summari ze th e publ ic comments we received on concerns raised regarding our proposed cost of implementing a nd maintaini ng the APIs and provide our responses. Comment : Some c ommenter s expressed concern that CMS underestimated the complexity of implementing the API requirements and did not agree with the agency's estimation that the API implementation is a one-time cost. These c ommenter s noted that additiona l costs include: the costs to contrac t with third -party applications, the costs of ongoi ng education, and the cost of answeri ng questions from members about data and errors. Commenters argued that the proposed API requirements significantly a dd to overhea d costs and will increase c osts for providers and payers, rather than facilitate information exchang e and better care for patients . One commenter estimated a range of between $1 million and $1.5 milli on to implement the API requirements, with an additional $200,000 to maintain the API. Anothe r commente r argued that the costs of implementation could be as high as four t im es the estimates C MS provided. Response : We t hank commenter s for their input and understand their concerns a ssociated with the cost required to implemen t the requirements o f this final rule. We understand that our CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 362 estimates regarding the implementation of the API provisions may vary depending on a number of factors, including, but not limited to a payer's current knowledge of and experience with implementing FHIR -based APIs, and whether an impacted payer will develop this technology in- house or seek a third party contractor to support this effort. To further develop our cost estimates, we reviewed the cost estimates associated with updating Blue Button from Blue Button 1.0 to 2.0 to include a standards- based API, similar to the requirements of this final rule. This update was estimated at $2 million. However, we believe that the estimates associated with updating the existing Blue Button 1.0 to a standards- based API for Blue Button 2.0 do not a ccurately represent the costs for payers impacted by this final rule. Blue Button 1.0 was developed across s everal federal agencies, including the Departments of Defense , Health and Human Services, and Veterans Affairs , with a capability to allow beneficiaries online access to their own personal health records, such as the ability to download PDF documents. Unlike the standards -based APIs required under this final rule, Blue Button 1.0 was not originally developed with a prescribed set of standards that allow for third- party apps to connect and retrieve data via an API. The estimates for Blue B utton account for upgrading an existing technology platform that was not originally developed to allow third- party app access via an API, which we believe adds additional cost that may not impact all payers under this final rule. Additionally, we note that costs related to federal procurement and the need to engage multiple contractors to implement the updates to Blue Button, while at the same time maintaining access to the original system, caused the cost of implementing standards -based APIs for Blue Butto n 2.0 to be higher than those costs for payers impacted by this final rule. Therefore, we believe that the estimates for upgrading Blue Button from 1.0 to 2.0 are not truly representative of the cost to implement the standards -based API required by this fi nal rule, but CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 363 nonetheless are valuable in further informing our cost estimates. As noted above, we did receive one comment that suggested a cost range between $1 million and $1.5 million to implement the API requirements of this final rule, with another commenter indicating a four-fold inc rease in costs relative to the estimates included in the proposed rule. While disagreeing with our bottom line, these commenters did not provide where in our detailed analysi s we unde restimated costs. For example, it is unc lear if the commenters were including voluntary provider costs, or other costs when calculati ng the dollar amounts for compliance . Therefore , without specific examples of additional costs that need to be accounted for in this impact analysis, we believe that our estimate s are reasonable. To address c ommenters' concerns regarding ongoing costs, we remind reader s that w e specifically are accounting for a cost of $157 ,656 per organization, for costs throughout the year to include: allocating resources to ma intain the FHIR server, which include s the cost of maintaining the necessary patient data, and perform capabilit y and security testing. However, in an effort to take into account the additiona l information that commenters presented regarding our costs estimates, and understanding there are many factor s that may influence the cost of implementi ng these policies, as noted above, we are adjusting our cost estimat es to reflect a range instead of a point estimate. We be lieve that our cost projections for an initia l one-time cost to implement the API requirements of this final rule of $718,41 4 per organization, reflecting 6 months of work by a team of ten professionals , can now serve as a minimum estimate ; in other words, w e do not believe it is technically feasible to implemen t the requirement s of this final rul e in less than 6 m onths. For a pr imary estimate, we have increased our cost estimates by a factor of 2 to account for cost variation. We note that using this factor of 2, the cost per organization is consist ent w ith the commenter stating a $1 million to $1.5 million CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 364 per organization cost. For a high estimate we have increased our cost estimates by a factor of 3. Although, one commenter noted a factor of 4 should be included, all other information available to us, including the commenter who noted a range between $1 million and $1.5 million, and our estimates for upgrading Blue Button, a factor of 4 does not appear to be reflective of the costs for implementation and represents more of an outlier for cost esti mating purposes. As shown in section XIII. of this final rule , we have revised down our estimate of affected individual market enrollees from 76 million (all commercial market enrollees) to 17.5 million (those individual market enrollees directly affected by this final rule). This reduction by a factor o f 4 (76 million former estimate / 17.5 million revised estimate) raises the cost per individual market enrollee per year by a factor of 4 consistent with the commenter's suggested factor of 4. This factor of 4, however, only affects cost per enrollee per year; it does not affect total costs as calculated in Table 2. Additionally, we note that as part of our original estimated costs associated with the annual burden of the requirements of this final rule, we accounted for additional capability testing and long-term support of the APIs, increased data storage needs, such as additional servers, or cloud storage to store any additional patient health information, and allocation of resources to maintain the FHIR server, and perform capability and security testing. Therefore, our estimates related to the annual burden account for the ongoing cost, and we are not providing additional estimates for maintenance as this is already factored in. The burden estimate related to the new requirements for implementing and maintaining the APIs reflects the time and effort needed to colle ct the information described above and disclose this information. We now estimate: An initial set one- time costs associated with the implementing the API requirements.CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 365 An ongoing maintenance cost after the system is set up, and the costs associated with additional data storage, system testing, and maintenance. Consistent with our discussion above, we now regard this as a low or minimum estimate, the argument being that a complex system cannot be designed in less than 6 months. Our high estimate now r eflects 18 months of work (4,320 hours) for administrators and network architects. This is obtained by using a factor of 3 (4,320 hours (high estimate) = 3*1440 hours, the original estimate). For a primary estimate, we estimate 12 months of work or 2,880 hours (1,440 hours * 2) for administrators and network architects. The use of a factor of 2 is consistent with a $2million cost per entity and consistent with the commenter who estimated an implementation cost of $1 million to $1.5 million. We note that, i n terms of actual implementation, this assumption is focused on the 2,880 hours of work that could be conducted in less than 12 months through necessary personnel or third -party contractor allocation, if needed. As a result, t he \"12-month\" assumption is al so consistent with the implementation of the new API requirements, which must be implemented by January 1, 2021. As can be seen from the bottom rows of Table 2: For a low estimate, first year implementation will require a total of 8,400 hours per organization at a cost of $718,414.40 per organization (this number is obtained by adding the products of hourly wages and hours required in each row, for example 1440*$90.18 + 960*$95.60, etc.). For a high estimate, first year implementation will require a total of 25,200 hours per organization at a cost of $2,365,243 per organization (this number is obtained by adding the products of hourly wages and hours required in each row). For a primary estimate, first year implementation will require a total of 1 6,800 hoursCMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 366 of work per organization at a cost of $1,576,829 per organization. Therefore, the aggregate burden of the first year implementation across 345 parent organizations67 is 2,898,000 hours (8400 * 345) at a cost of $272 million ($718,414 * 345) for the low estimate. Similar calculations show that the primary estimate is 5,796,000 hours at an aggregate cost of $544,005,936 million, and the high estimate is 8,694,000 hours at a cost of $816,008,904. Similarly, ongoing maintenance after the first year will require a total of 1,710 hours per organization at a cost of $157,656.60 per organization. Therefore, the aggregate burden of ongoing implementation across 345 parent organizations is $54.4 million ($157,656.60 * 345). We explicitly note that a low and high estimate were only provided for the first year, but not for subsequent years.

ICRs Regarding Conditions of Participation for Hospitals and Critica l Access Hospitals (42 CFR 482.24 (d), 482.61(f), 485.638(d)) We are expanding our requirements for interoperability within the hospital and CAH CoPs by focusing on electronic patient event notifications . We are implementing new requirements in s ection X. of this final rule for hospitals at 42 CFR 482.24(d), for psychiatric hospitals at 42 CFR 482.61(f), a nd for CAHs at 42 CFR 485.638(d). Specifically, for hospitals, psychiatric hospitals, and CAHs, we are finalizing simila r requirements to revise the CoPs for Medicare- and Medicaid-participating hospitals , psychiatric hospitals, and CAHs by adding a new standard, \"Electronic Notifications,\" that will require hospitals, psychiatric hospitals, and CAH s to make electroni c patient event notifications availabl e to applicable pos t-acute care services providers and suppliers, and to community practitioners such a s the patient's e stablished CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 368 primary care pr actitioner, established primary care pr actice group or entity, or other practitioner or practice group or entity identified by the patient as primarily re sponsible for his or her care. We are limiting this requirement to only those hospitals, psychiatric hospitals , and CAHs that utilize electroni c medical records systems, or other electronic administrative systems, which are conformant with the content exchange standard at 45 CFR 170.205(d)(2) , recognizi ng that not all Medicare- and Medicaid-participating hospitals have been eligible for past programs promoting adoption of EHR s ystems. If the hospital's (or CAH's ) system conforms to the content exchange standar d at 45 CFR 170.205(d)(2), the hospital (or CAH) must then demonstrat e that its s ystem's notification capacity is fully operationa l and that the hospita l (or CAH) uses it in accordance with all state and federa l s tatutes and regulations applicable to the hospital's (or CAH's) exchange of patient health information, and that its system (to the e xtent permissible under applicable federal and state law and regulations, and not inconsistent with t he patient' s expressed privacy preferences) sends the notification s either directly, or through a n intermediar y that facilitates exchange of health information. It must also demonstrate that the notifications include at least patient name, treating practitioner name, and sendi ng institution name. Upon the patient's registration in the emergency department or admission to inpatient services, and a lso either immediately prior to, or at the time of, the pa tient's discharge or transfer (from the emergency department or inpatient services), the hospita l (or CAH ) must also demonstrate that it has made a reasonable effort to ensure that its syste m sends the notifications to all applicable post-acute c are services pr ovider s and suppliers, as well as to any of the following practitioners and entities , which need to receive notification of the patient's status for treatment, c ar e coordination, or quality improvement purposes : (1) the patient's established primary care practitioner; ( 2) the patient's established primary care practice group or entity; o r CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 369 (3) other practitioner, or other practice group or entity, identified by the patient as the practitioner, or practice group or entity, primarily responsible for his or her c are. These requirements will help support coordination of a patient's care between settings or with service s received through di fferent care settings. Electronic pa tient event notifications from these care settings, or clinical event notifications , are one type of health informati on exchange interventi on that has been increasingly recognized as an effective and scalable tool for improving care coordination acros s settings. These not ifications are typically automated, electronic communications from the admitti ng or discharging provider to applicable post-acute care services providers and suppliers, and also t o community practitioners identified by the patient, that alert the receiving providers or community practitioners that a patient is receiving, or has received, care at a different setting. These not ification s are frequently based on \"admission, discharge, and transfe r (ADT)\" messages, a standard message used within an EHR as the vehicle for communicating information about key change s in a patient' s statu s as they are tracked by the system (more information about the current standard supporting these messag es is available at http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=144). As note d in the ISA published by ONC , this messaging standar d has been widely adopt ed acros s the health care system continue to believe that care coordination can have a significant positive impact on the quality of life, consumer experience, and health outcomes for patients. As we have noted in the preamble to this rule, virtually a l l EHR systems (as well as older legacy electronic administrativ e systems, such as electronic p atient registration s systems, and which we are CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 370 including in this final rule) generate information to support the basic messages commonly used for electronic patient event notifications. While we acknowledge that some level of implementation cost would be realized for those providers not already transmitting notifications, we also note there is substantial agreement that implementation of these basic messaging and notification functions within such existing systems constitutes a relatively low cost burden for providers, particularly when such costs are considered alongside the innovative and beneficial patient care transition solutions and models for best practices they provide. Although we do not have current data on how many facilities are already transmitting electronic patient event notifications, 59 percent of hospitals were found to be routinely electronically notifying a patient's primary care provider upon his or her entry to the hospital's emergency department in 2015, which is an over 50 percent increase since 2012. 68 By using this historical data to plot a power trend line (R -Squared: 0.9928), we estimate that approximately 71 percent of hospitals may have been routinely transmitting patient event notifications by 2018; therefore, we assume that 29 percent of hospitals, or approximately 1,392, will incur costs associated with updating or configuring their respective EHR systems for electronic patient event notifications. While we do not have parallel data for CAHs, we assume that a similar percentage, or approximately 394 CAHs, will incur this burden. We note that this upwards trend of patient event notification adoption may continue to some unknow n extent absent this final rule; however, we are limiting our projection of hospitals that are most affected by these requirements to 2018 due to the amount of uncertainty involved in quantifying this burden. 68 Office of the National Coordinator.

Hospital Routine Electronic Notification: Percent of U.S. Hospitals that Routinel y Electronicall y Notify Patient's Primar y Care Provider upon Emergenc y Room e that thi s process w ill primarily requir e the servic es of two medical records and health informati on technicians at approximately $42.32/hour for 16 hours each, and 3 hours of time from a medical and healt h services manager at approximately $109.36/hour, including the costs of overhead and fringe benefits. Thus, the total burden per facility is anticipated to be 35 hours, or approximately $1,682.32 ((16 hours * $42.32 /hour * 2 health information technicians) + (3 hours * $109.36/ hour * 1 manager)) . We assume that the ongoi ng burden associated with maintenanc e of these sys tem s would be approximately one qua rter of t hese amounts for the 2 medica l records a nd health information technicians, or 4 hours each, for a total of 8 hours and $338.56 per facilit y (4 hours * $42.32 /hour * 2 healt h informat ion technicians). In this lower -bound scenario, w e estimate that the total first-year burden for hospitals and psychiatric hospitals is approximately 48,720 hours (35 hours * 1,392 hospitals) or $2,341,789 ($1,682.32 * 1,392 hospitals). In subsequent years, we est imat e the burden is approximately 11,136 hours (8 hours * 1,392 hospitals) or $471, 276 ($338.56 * 1,392 hospitals). For CAHs we estimate that the total first-year burden is approximately 13,790 hours (35 hours * 394 CAHs) or $662,834 ($1,682.32 * 394 CAHs). In subsequent years, we estimate the burden for CAHs is approximately 3,152 hours (8 hours * 394 CAHs) or $133,393 ($338.56 * 394 CAHs). Due to the amount of un certaint y involved i n these estimates , we are also presenting estimat es for a s cenario in w hich the numbe r of hospitals that routinely electronically notify primary care providers both inside and outside of the hospital's system is assumed to have remained static at the 2015 rate of 29 percent. This uppe r-bound scenari o would indicate that in 2018 approximately 3,407 hospitals and 964 CAHs did not routinely utilize patient event CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 372 notification, and therefore several thousand additional providers would incur the previously estimated burden per facility. For the purposes of the PRA, we are assuming the midpoint of this range of effects. In this scenario 2,400 hospitals and psychiatric hospitals, and 679 CAHs would incur the estimated burden. The burden estimates associated with the revised CoPs are detailed in Table 3. This information collection will be submitted to OMB under OMB Control Number 0938- New.

CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 374 XIII. Regulator y Impact Analysis A. Statement of Need A s described in detail in section III . of this rule, the changes to 42 CFR parts 422, 431, 438, 457, and 45 CFR part 156 are part of the agency's broader efforts to empower patients by ensuri ng that they have full access to their own healt h care data, through common technologies and without special effort, while keeping that information saf e and secure. Interoperability and the c apability for health information s ystems and software applications to communicate, exchange, and interpret data in a usable and readable format , such as PDF or text, is vital, but allowing access to health care data through PDF and text format also limits the utility and sharing of data. Moving to a system in which patients ha ve access to their health care data will help empowe r them to make informed decisions a bout their health care, as well as share their data with provider s who can assist these pa tients with their health care. The pol icies are designed to move Medicare, M A, Medicaid, CHIP, and Q HP issuers on the F FEs furthe r to that ultimate goal of empowering their enrollees . As technology has advanced, we have encouraged states, payers, a nd providers to adopt various forms of technology t o improve the accurate and timely exchange of standardized health care information. The policies in this final rul e enable patients to be active partners in the exchange of electronic health care data by easily monitoring or shari ng their data. States and CMS routinely exchange data on who is enrolle d in Medicare , and which parties are liable for paying that beneficiary's Parts A and B pr emium s. These \" buy-in\" data exchanges support state, CMS, and SSA premium accounting, collections, and enrollment functions . We have become increasingly concerned about the limitations of monthly buy-in data exchanges with states. The relatively long lag in updating buy-i n data means that t he state is not CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 375 able to terminat e or activate buy -in coverage sooner, so the state or beneficiar y may be paying premiums for longer than appropriate. We note that once the data catch up, states and CMS reconcile the premiums by recouping and re- billing, so premiums collected are ultimately accurate, but only with an administratively burdensome process involvi ng debits and payments between the beneficiar y, state, CMS, SSA, and potentially providers. Daily buy-in data exchange will reduce this administrative burden. States submi t data on files at least monthly to CMS to identify all dua lly eligible individuals , including full- benefit and partial -benefit dually eligibl e beneficiaries (that is, those who get Medicaid hel p with Medicare premiums, and ofte n for cost-sharing). The MMA file was originally developed to me e t the need to timely i dentify dually e ligible beneficiaries for the then- new Medicar e Part D prescription drug benefit. Over time, we use these files' dat a on dua l eligibility status to s uppor t Part C capitation risk-adjustment, and most recentl y, feeding dual eligibility status to P art A and B eligibility and claims processing systems so providers, suppliers, and beneficiaries have accurate information on benefic iary cost-sharing obligations. As CMS now utilizes MMA data on dual eligibility status in systems supporting all four parts of the Medicar e program, it is becoming even more essential that dual eligibility status is accurate and up- to-date. Dual eligibility status can change at any time in a month. Waiting up to a month for status updates can negatively impact ac cess to the correct level of benefit at t h e correct level of payment . As described in detail in section VII. of this rule , the changes to 42 CFR parts 406, 407, and 423 establis h frequenc y requirements that necessitate all states to participate in daily exchange of buy-in data , and updates frequency requirements to require all states to participate in daily exchange of MMA file data, with CMS by April 1, 2022. B. Overall ImpactCMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 376 We ha ve examined the impact s of this final rule as require d by Executive Order 12866 on Regulator y Planning and Review (September 30, 1993) , E xecutive Order 13563 on Improving Regulati on and Regulatory Review (January 18, 2011), the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (September 19, 1980, Pub. L . 96-354), section 1102(b) of the Social Security Act, section 202 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (March 22, 1995; Pub. L . 104- 4) , Executive Order 13132 on Federalism (August 4, 199 9), the C ongressiona l Review Act (5 U.S.C. 804( 2)), and Executive Order 13771 on Reduci ng Regulati on and Controlling Regulatory Costs (January 30, 2017). Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternative s and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental , public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, a nd equity). S ection 3(f) of Executive Orde r 1286 6 defines a \"significant regulatory action\" as an action that is likely to result in a rule: (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more in any 1 year , or adversely and materially affecti ng a sector of the economy, productivity, competiti on, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or state, loc a l or t ribal gov ernments or communities (also referred to as \"economically significant\") ; (2) creating a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planne d by anothe r agency; (3) materially altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof ; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issue s arising out of legal mandates, t he Presid ent's priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive Order. A regulatory impact a nalysis (RIA) mus t be prepared fo r major r ules with economically significan t effects ($100 million or more in any 1 year). We estimate that this rulemaking is CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 377 \"economically si gnificant \" as measured by the $100 million threshold, and he nc e also a major rule unde r the Congressional Review Act. Accordingly, we have prepared an RIA that to the best of our a bility presents the costs and benefits of the rulemaking. Table 5 summarizes the estimated costs presented in s ection XII. of th is final rule. In the proposed rule, we provided detaile d estimations of the require d labor categories and number of hours require d to implement standards-base d APIs (84 FR 7659) . We originally estimated a one-time burden of $789 ,356 per organization or state, per implementation, with an ongoing maintenance cost $158,359. 80 per organization or state (84 FR 7659). A s we de tailed in section XII., to account for additional information commenters presented regarding our costs estimates, we are adjusting our original cost estimate s to reflect a range, instead of a point estimate. Our origina l estimate for the initia l one-time cost to implement the API requirements of this final rule of $788,41 4 per organization will now serve as a minimum estimate. We have increased our primary cost estimate by a factor of 2 to an initia l one -time cost of $1,57 6,829 per organization or state. Additionally, we are increasing our origina l cost estimate by a factor of 3 for an initial one-time cost of $2,365, 243 per organization or state to serve as a high estimate (detailed cost estimates are located in Table 5). T able 5 reflects upda ted wages for 2018, the latest available from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS ) website; the CMS Interoperability and P atient A ccess proposed rule used 2017 wage estimates. Nevertheless, the change in total impact w as small. We n ote that estimates below do not account for enrollment growth or higher costs associated with medical care. Thi s is becaus e the cost of requirements to implement patient access through APIs and for stat es to comply with data exchange requirements are not impacted by enrollment growth or higher costs associated with medical care. Per OMB guidelines, th e projected estimat es are expressed in CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 378 constant -year dollars (in this case, using 2018 prices and wages). Table 5 forms the basis for allocating costs by year and program to the federal government, state Medicaid agencies, and parent organizations.

We note that due to the implementation of APIs across multiple business lines, there is no straightforward method to immediately estimate parent organization expenditures on how much of the cost is born by each payer. Although this section provides such estimates it is important to understand how they are arrived at. A summary by Table in this section is provided in Table 6. As shown in Table 6: We first ascertain total costs of implementing this final rule by provision in (Table 5); As indicated earlier, we have no straightforward way of ascertaining total costs by payer since we do not have internal data for each parent organization on how it allocates costs by program; Therefore, to approximate costs we developed approximated proportions of total cost of each parent organization by payer (Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, and Individual market, including individual market plans sold on and off the Exchanges, as we expect that, among parent organizations of issuers that offer QHPs on the FFEs, costs will be passed on through all plans the issuers offer in the individual market. S ince this rule does not apply to QHP issuers offering QHPs only on Federally -facilitated Small Business Health Options Program Exchanges (FF-SHOP s) they were not included in our analysis. Our use of available data includes many approximations due to da ta limitations discussed in detail below (Table 7); Table 7 then allows us to obtain proportions of total costs for this final rule by payerCMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 381 (Table 8); Since we know the way federal payments for both Medicare and Medicaid are calculated, we can then obtain total costs by payer incurred by the federal government (Table 9); We next subtracted federal payments by payer (Table 9) from total costs by payer (Table 8) to obtain the non- federal costs of this final rule by payer (Table 10); Table 11 pres ents the same data as Table 10; Table 10 presents total non -federal costs per payer, while Table 11 presents average non- federal costs per enrollee per payer; Table 12 presents the same data as Table 9; while Table 9 presents total costs to the federal government by payer, Table 12 presents average federal costs per enrollee by payer; and Table 13 lists potential means for payers to deal with new costs.CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 382 TABLE 6: Outline of the Flow of Logic by Table for this Impact Analysis Table Content of Table Comments on Table 5 Total costs by provision (API, Dual) Costs are fully developed in the Collection of Information section of this final rule (section XII. of this final rule ). 7 Proportion of premiums by program (2016 -2018) used, in later tables, as a proxy for proportion of cost by program There is no straightforward way to directly assess parent organization cost by payer. Therefore, for each payer we develop approximate percentages of cost per payer. 8 API costs total cost by year and Program (Medicare, Medicaid, Individual market plans, and CHIP). This total cost is divided by cost to the federal government (Table 9) and non- federal costs to plans and enrollees (Table 10) We obtain the total API costs for this final rule per program by multiplying the API costs (for all programs) of this final rule (Table 5) by the proportion of premiums presented in Table 7. 9 Total costs incurred by the federal government by program and year Based on how federal payments are calculated in Medicare and Medicaid, we have projected federal proportions of the total cost and these are applied to Table 8 to obtain Table 9. 10 Non -federal total costs for API by program by year Table 9 = Table 8 -Table 10 - non-federal costs are obtained by subtracting federal costs (Table 9) from total costs (Table 8). 11 Average non -federal cost per enrollee per year by program for plans Tables 11 and 10 present the same data in different forms. Table 10 presents total non -federal cost by program for states and plans, while Table 11 presents average non -federal costs per enrollee per year for states and plans. 12 Average federal cost per enrollee per year by program for the federal government Tables 12 and 9 present the same data in different forms. Table 9 presents total cost to the federal government (due to matching programs), while Table 12 presents average cost per enrollee to the federal government. 13 How payers would defray the remaining costs This table lists potential means for a plan to deal with extra costs. We have no way of predicting what will actually happen. Preliminary Estimates : This section provides several detailed estimates of cost by payer (Table 7); we also account for federal matching for Medicaid and payments by the Trust Fund for Medicare Advantage organizations (Table 9); we indicate remaining burden on plans (Tables 10, 11) and how they might account for it (Table 12). However, these estimates are approximate as explained in detail below. Data Sources for Cost by Payer: To obtain allocation of cost by payer we used the CMS CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 383 public use files for MLR data, for 2016.69 The MLR data sets are for private insurance plans but the issuers of that private insurance in many cases also have contracts to provide MA, Medicaid, and CHIP managed care plans and report revenue, expense, and enrollment data for these plans on the private insurance MLR reporting form. Thus, these MLR data sets omit organizations that only have Medicare or Medicaid. The data from the CMS MLR files also omit: (1) the CHIP program; and (2) state Medicaid agencies. We now discuss these omissions to assess the accuracy of using these MLR files. CHIP : Eighty- five percent of the 194 CHIP managed care plans also offer Medicaid and hence are covered by the parent entity. We believe it reasonable that the remaining CHIP plans also have commercial offerings since it would be inefficient to operate a CHIP -only plan, as the total national CHIP enrollment is currently only about 7 million. Similarly, except for one state, CHIP programs are run through the state Medicaid agency; again, there would be one interoperab ility cost for the one state agency since the resulting software and systems would be used both for Medicaid and CHIP. Thus, while we are leaving out CHIP programs in this analysis since they are not in the CMS MLR files, we do not believe this materially alters the overall picture. Medicare Advantage: We compared the CMS MLR files with the CMS Trustee Report.70 According to the Trustee Report (Table IV.C2), total MA revenue for 2016 was $189.1 billion. Thus, the reported amount in the CMS MLR files of $157 billion for MA represents 83 percent 69 Center for Consumer Informati on and Insurance Oversight. ( n.d.).

Retrieved from https://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Resources/Data- Resources/ml r.html . 70 See Table IV.C 2 in, B oards of Trustees (Federal Hospital Insurance and Federal Supplementar y Medical Insurance Trust Funds). (2018, J une 5). The 2018 Annual Report of The Boards of Trustees of the Federal Hospital Insurance and Federal Supplementar y Medical Insurance Trust Funds. Retrieve d from h of all MA activity reflected in the Trustee Report. Therefore, we believe the proportions obtained from these MLR files are accurate. Medicaid : For the year for which these MLR files provide data (2016), about 70 percent of Medicaid enrollees were enrolled in Medicaid managed care.71 Thus, although the MLR files omit state agencies, we believe that the 70 percent of Medicaid enrollees enrolled in Medicaid managed care provides a good approximation. Individual and small group market plans : The MLR files contain data on all commercial parent organizations whether these organizations have other lines of business, such as Medicare Advantage or Medicaid, or not. In discussing commercial plans, we account for: (A) large group market plans; (B) small group market plan s, including SHOP plans; (C) individual market Exchange plans; and (D) individual market off-Exchange plans. We have carved out the large employer plans since the provisions of this final r ule do not apply to them, and we do not believe that parent organizations would pass on costs for individual and small group market plans to large group employer-sponsored plans. We have noted that the provisions of this final rule do not apply to QHP issuers offering QHPs only on FF- SHOPs , so we are not including small group market plans in this analysis. We believe it is reasonable, that even though the provisions of this final rule do not apply to off-Exchange individual market plans, issuers subj ect to this rule offering QHPs on the FFEs will spread the cost to all plan s issuers offer in the individual market. They will also likely offer the benefits of the APIs to all covered lives, as they can be marketed as a value add service, 71 Centers for Medicare and Medicai d Services. ( 2018, November 8) . CMS Proposes C hanges to Streamline and Strengthe n Medicai d and CHIP Manage d Care Regulations. and it is logistically more challenging to offer a service to only a limited number of enrollees. We estimate that off -Exchange plans offered by issuers who offer no QHPs on FFEs are abou t 7 percen t of t otal individua l market enrollment. Therefore, to the exten t that we are including off-Exchange plans, the calculations below will be an approximation, but given this low proportion of off-Exchange-only issuers, we do not believe including them in this approximation will ha ve a majo r impact. Best Estimat es of Impact p er Program and Payer : We present two methods to obtain an estimate of cost by program and payer, both for purposes of assessi ng impact on: (1) small entities ; (2) the federa l governmen t; (3) payers (s tates and plans ); and (4) enrollees. We could assume c osts proportional to current enrollment, or alternatively, we could assume c osts proportional to total premium. For purposes of analyzi ng impact on small entities and impacts of the provision on the federal government, payers, plans, a nd enrollees we are using the method of assuming costs proportiona l to total premium (the method of assuming costs proportional to current enrollment will b e used below to assess impact on transfer s to enr ollees). The CMS Interoperability and Patient A ccess pr oposed rule used 2016 CMS MLR files (84 FR 7662) . Since its publication, 2017 and 2018 data have become available. However, we are only using these data to obtain proportions and, as Table 7 shows, the proportions for premiums have not changed significantl y (only one quarter to one third percent for Medicare and Medicaid) . Therefore , we retain and continue to use the 2016 proportions for purposes of this analysis with a note that they generally have remained constant. These proportions of premiums are being used as a proxy to approximate total cost. In the proposed rule we used the full $370 billion in comme rcial premium in determining our proportions (84 FR 7662). As discussed above, we are revising the e stimates b ecause u pon CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 386 further consideration, we have concluded that issuers in the commercial group markets are unlikely to spread the costs through increas ing premium rates on those type s of plan s be cause issuers are not required to implement and maintain the API requirements of thi s final rule in the group markets and there are no indications that employer groups in these markets would be willing to pay for this provision through increased premium rates. Consequentl y, the $370 billion commercial premium is being reduced to $77 billion a nd the 76 million enrollees are being reduce d to 17.5 million. As discussed above, the $370 billi on (and 76 million enrolle es) represented both individual and small group and large group market plans; the $77 billion and 17.5 million enroll ees represent all individual market plans whether they are sold on and/or off-Exchange . We note that this reduction from our o rigina l estimate is due to the fact that most plans are large employer plans, and the individual market is only 20 to 23 percent of the full health insurance market. T his refinemen t bette r aligns with the proportion of the marke t impacted by this final rule. A mong issuers with products in both the individual market and M A or the individual market and Medicaid, the 2016 CMS MLR files show $77 bill ion reported in premium for individual market plans , $157 bi llion reported for MA, and $113 billion reported for Medicaid. Consequently, the proportion of interoperability cost for eac h of the programs is 22.19 (77/(77+157+113)), (157/(77+157+113)), a nd 32.56 percent for individua l market plans, MA, and Medicaid respectivel y. Table 7 shows similar proportions for 2017 and 2018. CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 387 TABLE 7: Proportion of Premiums (in billions) for Medicare, Medicaid, and Individual Mar ket Plans Year Medicaid Medicare Advantage Individual Market Plans Totals 2016 Premium (billions) 113 157 77 347 2017 Premium (billions) 119.5 170.3 86 376 2018 Premium (billions) 127 184 91 402 2016 Percentage (used in this RIA in all estimates) of total costs by program ated earlier, since cost allocation at the parent organization level and the allocations of each parent organization may differ by program (Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, and Individual market plans ) and is an internal business decision, we cannot direc tly assess per -payer costs. However, using the MLR tables, we can assess the proportions of cost by program. We can then multiply these proportions (as presented in Table 7) by the total costs of this final rule as presented in Table 5 to obtain Table 8, which breaks out the total column in Table 5, the total cost by year of implementing and maintaining the API, to offer API costs by year and program.

To t he extent that issuers increase pr emiums for indivi dual market plans on the FFEs, there would be federal premium tax credit (PTC) impacts. The pur pose of the PTC is to assi st enrollee s in pa ying premium cos ts. Since PTCs are only available if an individual purchases an individual market plan on an Exchange, the PTC estimates apply only to Exchange plans. In the PTC estimate, we have accounted for the fact that som e issuer s have both Exchang e and non-Exchange plans, and some issuers have only non- Exchange plans. We reflected these assumptions with global adjustments, so we believe t he estimat es are reasonable in aggregate. Medicar e Advantage : MA organizations may increase bids to reflec t the costs of this final rule. Some of these expe cted increased bid costs may i ncreas e Medicar e Trust Fund payments. For those (most) MA organizations whose bid amount is below the benchmar k, the Trust Fund provides total expenditures to the MA organizations consisting of: (1) full payment of the bid amount; and (2) the rebate, a portion of the difference between the benchmark a nd the bid amount. Since MA organizations are increasing their bid amounts to reflec t the costs of this final rule, it follows that the rebate, equaling the difference between the benchmark and bid, is decreased, resulting in less rebat es paid to the MA organizations. Based on our past experience and projections for th e future, the rebat e is est imated as 34 percent of the differenc e between benchmar k and bid. Thus, alt hough the Trust Fund pays the bid in full, nevertheless, 66 percent of the increased b id costs arising fro m this final rule, are reduced from t he rebates. The MA CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 389 organizations in its submitted bid, can address this reduction of rebates by either: (1) temporarily, for marketing purposes, absorbing the loss by reducing its profit margin; (2) reducing the supplemental benefits it provides the enrollee paid for by the rebate; or (3) raising enrollee premiums in order to provide supplemental benefits for which premiums are not paid by the rebate. The decision of what approach to use is an internal business decision in part motivated by unforeseen forces of marketing; we therefore have no way of predicting what will happen. Medicaid: State Medicaid agencies may be allowed to allocate the costs of state information retrieval systems between the costs attributable to design, development, installation, or enhancement of the system \u2014at a 90 percent federal match \u2014and for ongoing operations of the system \u2014at a 75 percent federal match. For Medicaid managed care entities, we assume an MCO, PIHP, and PAHP cost for implementing the standards-based API provisions would be built into the capitation rates and paid for by the state Medicaid agency, with the state Medicaid agency being reimbursed at the state's medical assistance match rate. For purposes of these estimates we use the weighted FMAP, 58.44, which is based on our past experience with this program. Medicaid managed care costs constitute 52 percent of the Medicaid program costs. 72 Conseque ntly, for the first year (implementation year), the federal matching is (0.48*0.90+0.52*0.5844) of the total program costs, reflecting the 90 percent first year implementation matching for state agencies which comprise 48 percent of the program cost plus 58.44 percent matching for the Medicaid managed care plans which comprise 52 percent of the program costs. Similarly, for years after the first the federal costs are (0.48*0.75+0.52*0.5844) 72 Allen, K. (2019, April 18). Medicai d Manage d Care Spending in 2018. Retrieved from https://www.healthmanagement.com/blog/medicaid -managed-c are -spending-i n -2018/. total program cos ts. CHIP: Most states ope rate Medicaid and CHIP from the same state agency. One state is a notable exception i n that it has a separate Medicaid and CHIP agency. The federal government pays an enh anced federal medical assistan ce pe rcentage (EFMAP ) to states for all costs associated with CHIP, including system s costs (this is unlike Medicaid wher e there a re different FMAPs for different types of costs) . For federal FY 2019, the EFMAPs will range from 88 to 100 percent. For federal FY 2020, the EFMAPs will range from approximately 76.5 to 93 percent. After federal FY 2020, the EFMAPs will range from approximately 65 to 81.5 percent. Since the CHIP program federal rebat e range s include the 90 p ercent and 75 percent federal matching proportions of t he Medicaid program, we are applying the 90 percent and 75 pe rcent from Medicaid to the CHIP programs. Since the CHIP p rogra m is small relative to the Medicaid program, we believe this approac h reasonable. Table 9 uses these pr oportions to estimate the impact of the API on the federal government. For example, the $65.2 million cost to the federal gove rnment for Medicaid/CHIP for 2020 (low estimate), the implementation year of t he API, is obtained by mul tiplying the total $88.6 million (low estimate ) cost listed in Table 8 by (0.48*0.90+0.52*0.5844) the ratio indicated i n the previous paragraphs. These assumptions on al l first-year federal expens es are reflected in Table 9 which include s PTC payments as well as federal matching in Medicaid and Medicare. For PTC and Medicar e we ha ve assumed Federal payment in 2021. We note that w e are not discussing at this point how parent organizations will bear these costs. This will be discussed below. However, the basis for the discussion is the calculation of non-feder al cost born by enrollees and plans which is obtained by subtracting federal costs from total costs.

Furthermore , as discus sed above, federal payments to Med icar e Advantag e for implementation occurs fully in 2021. By taking the difference be tween the respective cells in Tables 8 (total costs by program) and 9 (total matching by the federal government), we obtain the remaining c osts for the API for Medicar e Advantage plans and for stat e Medicaid agencies. To this a mount (which only deals with the API provisions) must be added the coordination cost for the dual eligible (column 3 of Table 5) multiplied by the proportion of costs presente d in Table 7. This remaining cost born by Medicar e Advantage plans and state Medicaid agencies is presented in Table 1 0. Since the federal gove rnment does not match QHP costs, the total cost for QHPs on the FFEs is born in its entirety by the plans. This also is listed in Table 10; however, in subtracting Table 9 from Table CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 392 8, we exclude PTC costs. These are federal costs, but unlike Medicare Advantage and Medicaid, the QHPs on the FFEs must account for the full cost of implementation. These PTC costs are not used to defray API costs. For e xample, Table 10 lists for 2020 (low estimate), Medicaid/CHIP a remaining cost to states of $24.3 million ($88.6 million total (low estimate) cost for 2020 (Table 8) - $65.2 million matched by the federal government (Table 9) + ($2.8 million total cost for coordination of dual eligibles (Table 5) * 32.56 percent (proportion of total costs incurred by Medicaid/CHIP (Table 7)). (There are minor differences due to rounding.)

We a lso discuss whether th e costs are e xcessiv e for existing plan s as well as how new plans might deal with these costs. The further discussion of bearing these costs is illustrated by reformulating the costs in terms of costs per enrollee (per y ear), which is obtained by dividing the total c ost to the payer for CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 393 all programs in which it participates (Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, and Individual marke t plans ) by its total enrollment. As an example, if a payer hypothetically spent $1 billion in a year for 100,000 enrollees then the cost per enrollee per year is $10,000 ($1 billion / 100,000). As can be seen from this example, the cost per enrollee metric facilitates comparison of costs. Since program expenditures for both Medicaid and MA are typically hundreds of millions (or billions) of dollars, concepts like burden and negligibility may not have intuitive meaning, as opposed to the costs per enrollee, which are more manageable and understandable. To provide background, the 2018 Medicare Trust Fund Report 73 states that costs per enrollee are projected to be roughly $12,000 - $14,000 for contract years 2020 - 2023 (Table IV.C3). The costs per enrollee for the Medicaid program are similarly several thousand dollars.The estimates in the 2019 Medicare Trust Fun d Report are identical. 74 For purposes of indicating the cost per enrollee, we estimate 110.5 million enrollees will be affected by these provisions since currently there are 17.5, 6675, 2076, and 777 million enrollees covered by payers in the individual market, Medicaid, MA, and separate CHIP 73 Boards of Trustees (Federal Hospital Insurance and Federal Supplementar y Medical Insurance Trust Funds).

Table 11 presents costs per enrollee by program for payers after reducing total costs by federal matching, while Table 12 presents costs per enrollee by program for the federal government. For example, the 2020 (low estimate) cost per enrollee for commercial individual market plans is $3.48 (Table 11), which is obtained by dividing the total, 2020, low- estimate, non - federal, individual market plan cost of $61 million (Table 10) by 17.5 million e nrollees. (This is based on the low estimate of cost for API; the high estimate of cost would be $10.38 = $181.7 million / 17.5 million). The 2022 cost per enrollee for state Medicaid agencies after federal matching is 9 cents per enrollee (Table 11), which is obtained by dividing the total non- federal cost per program after federal matching, $6.2 million (Table 10) by 73 million enrollees (66 million in Medicaid + 7 million in CHIP). Each of these three calculations restates total spending per program per stakeholder (government, state Medicaid agencies, or Medicare Advantage plans) in terms of cost per enrollee.

We emphasi ze that Table 13 lists pot ential legal possibilities. What actually happens will depend on market dyna mics and internal business decisions, and we have no straightforward way of predicting what the se actual behavior s and respon ses w ill be. Individua l Marke t Pl ans : As noted above, individual market plans have the option of absorbing costs or passing costs to enrollees either in the form of higher premiums or reduced benefit s that are non -essential health benefit s (EHBs). The average estimated cost per enroll ee in 2021 through 2028 is under a dollar, which we assume issuers would pass on to enrollees. However, for purposes of market competitiveness, it is possible that some of the 2020 average estimated cost of $3.48 per enrollee (low estimate) or $10.38 per enrollee per year (high estimate) would be absorbed by each QHP issuer on an FFE. Medicaid: State Medicaid agencies a nd CHIP are a dding a cost under 10 cent s per CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 396 enrollee for 2021 through 2029. Total costs per enrollee for the Medicaid program are several thousand dollars. We note, the federal government is incurring costs capped at $2.68 per enrollee per year in 2020 and at 16 cents per enrollee per year in 2021 through 2029. Medicare Advantage : In their bids (submitted the June prior to the beginning of the coverage year), Medicare Advantage plans would addres s the reduced rebates (arising from increased bid costs due to the increased costs of this final rule being included in the bid) by either: (1) temporarily absorbing costs by reducing profit margins; (2) reducing the supplemental benefits paid for by the r ebates; or (3) raising enrollee cost sharing or premiums (however, we believe many plans for competitive reasons would chose to remain zero premium and either absorb losses for one year or reduce rebate-funded supplemental benefits in the amount per enrollee shown in Table 9). Table 13 summarizes these methods of bearing the remaining costs. TABLE 13: How Payers Would Defray Remaining Costs Individual Market Plans Individual market plans generally have the option of absorbing costs (for example, for reasons of market competitiveness), increasing premiums to enrollees , or modifying cost -sharing or non- EHB covered benefits. Cost would be spread over all parent organization enrollees in a specified state and the individual market in FFE states. Small commercial individual market issuers seeking certification of plans as QHPs on the FFEs may request an exception to the API provisions. Medicaid/CHIP State Medicaid agencies would bear the cost (under 10 cents per enrollee). Medicaid plans are fully capitated but may have to defer first year costs. Medicare Advantage (MA) MA plans in their June -submitted bids would address the reduced rebates (arising from increased bid costs due to the increased costs of this final rule being included in the bid) by either: (1) temporarily absorbing costs by reducing profit margins; (2) reducing additional benefits paid for by the rebates; or (3) raising enrollee cost sharing (however, many plans for compet itive reasons would chose to remain zero premium and either absorb losses for one year or reduce additional, rebate-funded benefits in the amount per enrollee shown in Table 9). Tax deferment and amortization as applicable ameliorates cost. Capital costs a re spread over entire parent organization enrollees. New plans are allowed to enter with initial negative margins with the expectation that they will stabilize over the first few years. PTC Impact : First, we note that there will be no impac t on the expected 2020 PTC payment becaus e 2020 premium rates were finalized last year, so even if issuer s incur expenses that they did not anticipate when setting rates , they will not b e able to reflect those expenses in the p remium rates, and therefore, the expected PTC payments for 2020 will not change. CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 397 Table 10 shows that for 2021 through 2029 the estimated impact to QHPs on the FFEs is a $12 million expense. This estimated $12 million expense burden represents an increase to annual FFE premium of approximately 0.03 percent. Within the FFE states, the estimated expense burden will impact premium rates in the individual market, and is spread across both Exchange and non-Exchange QHPs. PTCs are only paid for QHPs offered through Exchanges, and are calculated as a function of the second lowest cost silver plan. Because of the wide variability of Exchange plans we make the simplifying assumption that the industry would increase the second- lowest -cost silver plan premium rate in the same amount as the overall premium rate increase as a result of the RIA expense estimate. We can then apply the overall rate increase to the projected PTC payments in the FFE states to estimate the impact to PTC payments. Therefore, we estimate that impact to PTCs in the FFE states will be approximately $6 million per year starting in 2021, which is about 0.02 percent of the total 2021 expected PTC payment in FFE states. Again, the calculated PTC impact s in 2021 through 2029 are included with all federal impacts in Table 9. We next summariz e the public comments we received on our estimated impacts and provide our responses. Comment : Some commenters requested that the government share more in the associated costs of the open, standards -based API implementation for both MA and Medicaid plans. These commenters noted that additional financial sharing by the federal government would help remedy offsets potentially being absorbed by the health plan that may result in decreased benefits and/or increase premiums. Medicare Advantage: Some commenters r equested that the costs be included in MA bids. CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 398 Other commenters recommended that if CMS is going to make specifi c technological requirements around implementation of the CMS Interoperability and Patien t Access proposed rule then health plans should be allowed to include a pe rcentage of these cos t s in t heir MA bids. One commenter recommended that CMS could consider adding a fixed dollar amount to MA bids if health plans complied with the requirements of the proposed rule, or CMS could add it into the bid tool. Medicaid: Similar comment s were made for Medicaid plans. One commenter recommended that CMS provide states with a 100 percen t fe dera l matching to facilitate implementation and that state Medicaid agencies be required to include plan implementation costs into c apitation rates. Anothe r commente r requested that CMS require state Medicaid agencies to include a fixed amount of dollars or a percentage of implementation costs into plan administrative costs to remedy the cost impac t of i mplementation. Response : We a ppreciat e the commenters' concerns and suggestions. As noted previously in this RIA, we have assumed traditional federal sharing of costs for both the MA and Medicaid programs. The results have been presented in Tables 9 thr ough 12 with Table 13 indicating how payers and the federal gove rnment would defray costs. I n Tables 11 and 12 the average estimated costs per enrolle e (under $15) is compared with overall costs per enrollee (several thousand dollars). Additionally, we have been careful in our analysis to distinguish between federa l ma tching to s tate Medicaid entities in the first year, federa l ma tching to state Medicaid entities in la ter years, a nd federa l matching of state payment of capitation rates to state Medicaid agencies. We t ake not e that the commenter' s concerns for specifi c federal matching for the provisions of this final rule would require legislative action. Consequently, whe n writi ng the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access proposed rule, we did not believe it was necessary to CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 399 propose additional federal spendi ng beyond the already existing federal reimbursement to MA, Medicaid plans, and state agencies. Comment : A few commenters e xpressed concern that the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access proposed rule was not clear with regard t o w hether or not state Medicaid agencies would be allowed to allocate the costs of this implementation \u2014at a 90 percent federal match\u2014 and for ongo ing operations of the system\u2014a t a 75 pe rcent federal match. Commenter s requested that CMS provide clarity around the use of such language and exactne ss of \"pay f ors\" since this is vital for stat e Medicaid agencies' cost estimat es in implementing the requirement s of this r ule. Response : We a gree wi th the commenters. We t herefor e have revised the calculations to T able 10 to re flec t the following more precise accounting of costs : (1) 90 percen t of s tate Medicaid costs are paid or matched by the federa l gove rnment in the first year of i mplementing new systems; (2) 75 percent of Medicaid costs are matched for maintenanc e costs.; and (3) on average, state Medicaid agencie s are matched 58.44 percent. We be lieve this he ightened level of detail should satisfy commenter concerns. The revised number s are reflected in Tables 10 and Table 11. Comment: One c ommente r noted th at the developers of APIs may w an t additiona l fees to implement or provide access t o their APIs. The commenter noted that the se fees severely limit innovation in the marketplace for health IT solutions for storing and utilizing patient data, both on the patient and provider side of the equation. Response : The data that must be shared via the API under t his policy are data that the payer s have and must currently make availabl e to patients. We also an ticipat e that many payers will de velop the APIs in-hous e. If this commenter is more referencing the vendors creating apps, versus A PI s for payers, we also do not believe i t is appropriate t o charg e a fee, as discussed in CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 400 section III. of this final rule. If fees are charged for certain a pps, it is not the data that are ge nerating the fee, it is the product or services; indeed, there is a logical connection between the potentia l benefits of this rule (facilitated by new or enhanced services) and non-quantified potential costs (possibl y includi ng those associated with the development or improvement of such services). Currently there are vendors that collec t the publicly available directory data, clean these data, supplement these data, and offer this enhanced data product back to payers and providers. It is not the data t he vendor s are charging for as m uch as it is the service of cleaning and enhancing these data. Vendors may generate revenue from their third-part y apps, but a major component of this is the service they are providing\u2014buildi ng the app, making the data the patient directs to them most usable and valuable\u2014t hat generates the revenue. P ayer s must already make the se data available to patients. These data alone may also drive revenue, but it is the patient's prerogative to pr ovide their data to a third p arty in order to get a service in exchange Comment: A few commenters noted that RIA does not contain a ny costs for provider EHR connectivity. One commenter noted that EHR developers' contracts with providers and health systems do not include the cost of s ystem updates that will be required to comply with this proposal. Another commenter was concerne d that EHR developers will charge providers significan t fees to pe rform the updates require d to comply with CMS' proposals, a nd providers will likely need to make additional investments to learn how to use standards-based APIs and other new technologies. Anothe r commente r believes that for the clinical data to be available in any API, the CEHRT used by providers needs to be connecte d to a truste d exchange network. For many clinicians, the commente r noted the costs for connecting their CEHRT to a trusted network continues to remain a barrier. CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 401 Response : To address commenters' concern s with API connectivity to an EHR, we note that there is no requirement for a payer to link the Patient Access API to an EHR in this final rule, and there are associated challenges, as discussed elsewhere in this RIA, with attributing impacts to various in teracting regulatory and other policies. Indeed, we do note that if a provider does elect to connect an EHR to the APIs finalized in this rule, they would be required to meet all the requirements of ONC's Health IT Certification Program. 78 As part of that program, the 2015 CEHRT includes, for example, \"application access\" certification criteria that requires health IT to demonstrate it can provide application access to the Common Clinical Data Set (CCDS) via an API. 79 Furthermore, nearly a third of EHR vendors are also using the FHIR standard to meet 2015 CEHRT requirements.80 C.Anticipated Effects The RFA, as amended, requires agencies to analyze options for regulatory relief of small businesses, if a rule has a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. For purposes of the RFA, small entities include small businesses, nonprofit organizations, and small governmental jurisdictions. The API requirements in this final rule affect: 1) QHP issuers on the FFEs, 2) MA organizations, including those that are also Part D sponsors of MA- PD plans, as well as 3) Medicaid MCOs with a minimum threshold for small business size of $41.5 million (https://www.sba.gov/federal- contracting/contracting -guide/size- standards ). 78 Office of the National Coordinator.

Heat Wave: The U.S. is Poised t o Catch FHIR in of impact is complicated by the fact that costs have been aggregated at the parent organization level. A typical parent organization might have products with QHP issuers on the FFEs, MA, or Medicaid /CHIP programs. We have no way of directly assessing the size of parent organizations. Therefore, as a proxy, we analyze each payer separately. Medicare Advantage: We first assess the impact on MA plans. To clarify the flow of payments between these entities and the federal government, we note that MA organizations submit proposed plan designs and estimates of the amount of revenue necessary to cover the cost of those plan designs (called bids) by the first Monday in June of the year preceding the coverage year. Regulations governing this process are in 42 CFR part 422, subpart F. These bids must be broken down in the following: (1) T he revenue requirements for providing Medicare Part A and Part B benefits with actuarially equivalent cost sharing (this is the \"basic benefit bid\"); (2) The revenue requirements for providing supplemental benefits; (3) The revenue requirements for Non- Benefit Expenses such as Sales & Marketing, Direct and Indirect Administration, Net Cost of Reinsu rance, and Insurance Fees; and (4) For MA -PD plans, a Part D bid consistent with Part D regulations in 42 CFR part 423. These bids project payments to hospitals, provider s and staff for covered benefits, as well as the cost of pl a n administration and profi ts. Becau se the API requirement s finalized in this rule will apply to every MA plan and each MA plan must furnish at least th e Medica re Part A and Part B be nefits, the cost of the API will be built into the administrative component of the basic benefit bid. These bids in turn determine one component of the payments of the Medicare Trust Fund to the MA organizations who reimburse providers and subcontractors for their services. A second component of the Trust Fund payment to MA organizations are the rebates, which are a CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 403 portion of the difference be tween the basic benefit bid compared to an administratively -set benchmark for the MA plan's service area (currently, based on our past and projected experience , rebates vary by plan a nd are approximately 66 percent) . B enchmarks are based on a formul a using an estimat e of the Med icar e FFS per capit a cost for the geog raphi c area, which are adjusted to reflect th e per capit a cost of each county in t he U.S. and its territori es and adjusted for the enrollees' health statu s which is al so known as the risk score. Payments from the Medicare Trust Funds for monthly capitation rates (for basic benefits ) are capped at the benchmark; for basic benefit bids under the benchmark, a portion, currently approximately 66 percent, of the difference between the bid and benchmar k is made available to the MA organization to e ither : (1) pay for additiona l supplementa l benefits ; (2) include reductions in cost shari ng in the plan design; or (3) provide buy-downs of Part B or Part D premiums. Basic benefit bids that are at or above the benchmark receive payment from the Trust Funds of the benchmark amount, with any excess charge d to the enrollee as a premium. MA organizations are made aware of the benchmark thr ough the annual CMS publicati on, \"Announcement of Calendar Year [X] Medicare Advantage Capitation Rates and Medicare Advantage and Part D Payment Policies,\" which, consistent with section 1853 of the Act, is released prior to M A organizations submission of bids. This publication of the benchmark when coupled with plan awareness t ha t they will receive rebates if their plan bids fall below the benchmark facilitates that bids of most MA organization s are below the benchmar k and consequently most MA organizations receive from the Trust Fund a total expenditure equaling payment for the bid p lus the rebate. B ecaus e of these API provisions, w e assume that MA organizations will be raising the June-submitted bid amount to reflect additional administrative costs. While the Trust Fund pays CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 404 these bid amount s in full, the rebate g oes do wn as the bid increases: That is, since the bid amount goes up, the rebate, equaling the difference between the benchmark and bid, decreases and result s in less rebat e payment to the MA organization. The MA organization ha s several options of dealing with these increased bid costs and reduced rebates: The MA organizati on might decide to: (1) temporarily absorb the loss by reducing its profi t margin (so as to reduce the bid amount and thereby incre ase th e rebates); (2) reduce additional benefit s paid to the enroll ee from the rebates; or (3) rai se en roll ee premium s so as t o compensat e for the reduction of enrollee premium that would have happened if the bid had not been increased (note: for marketing purposes, many plans operate at zero premium, and we do not consider this third option a likely possibility) . In this RIA, we have referred to options (2) and (3) (reducti on of additional benefits and raisi ng of enroll ee pr emiums) as \"passing the costs to the enroll ee\" so that the \"effect \" of reduced rebates is fewer supplemental benefit s or higher en roll ee premium s than would have happened had the cost of the complying with the API provisions of this final rule not been imposed. Ther e are various types of Medicar e health plans, including MA H MOs, POS plans, and PPOs ; Demonstration p lans ; Cost Plans; Prescription D rug Plans (PDP) ; and Programs of All- Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE ) organization plans. This final rule affect s MA HMOs, MA POS plans, and MA PPOs including those that are MA-PDs, but does not affect Cost Plans, stand- alone Prescripti on Drug Plans , nor PACE organizations. Ther e are a variety of way s to assess whether MA organizations meet the $41.5 m illion threshold for small businesses. The assessment can be done by examining net worth, net income, cash flow from operations and projected claims as indicate d in their bids. Using projected monetary requirements and projected enrollment for 2018 from submitted bids, approximately 30 CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 405 percent of th e MA organization s fell below the $41.5 million threshold for small bus inesses. Additionally, an analysis of 2016 data, the most recent year for which we have actual data on MA organization net worth, shows that approximately 30 percen t of a ll MA organizations fall below the minimu m threshold for s ma ll bus inesses. Medicaid: We ne xt ass ess the impact on Medicaid managed care plans. Since Medicaid managed care plans receive 100 percent capitation from the state, we generally expect that the costs associated with the API provisions of this final rule, will be included in their capitation rates and may be reasonable, appr opriate, and attainable costs whether they are a small business or not. QHP issuers on the FFEs : Based on the 2016 CMS MLR data, approximately 85 out of 494, or 17 percent of companies (that either had only individua l market business, or had individua l market plus Medicare and/or Medicai d business) had total premium revenue of less than $41,500,000. I n other words, for MA, Medicaid, and QHP issuer s on t he FFEs, a significant number of small plans are affected. The RFA requir es us to assess w hether th e rule has a significant impact on the plans, which we do next. If a rule has a substantial impac t on a substantia l numbe r of smal l entities, the rule must discus s steps taken, including alternatives, to minimi ze bur den on sm all entities. Whil e a significant number (more than 5 percent) of not-for-profit organizations and small businesse s are affected by this final rule, the impact is not significant. T o assess i mpact, we use the data in Table 5, w hich shows that the total raw (not discounted) net effect of this final rule over 10 years is $714 million. Medicar e Advantage: W e first assess i mpact on MA pl ans. Compari ng the $714 million number to the total monetary amounts projected to be needed just for 2018, the most recent year CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 406 on which we have finalized plan submitted bid data (and which is expected to be less than the need in future years including 2019), we find that that the impact of this final rule is significantly below the 3 percent - 5 percent threshold for significant impact for MA plans . Medicaid: We next assess impact on Medicaid managed care plans. The total projected capitation payment and premiums for 2019 is projected to be $337.6 billion.81 Hence, the total cost of this final rule over 10 years, $714 million, is significantly below the 3 percent - 5 percent threshold for significant impact to Medicaid manag ed care plans. QHP issuers on the FFEs : As discussed prior to Table 6 based on data in the public CMS MLR files, commercial health insurance issuers had premium revenue of $77 billion for individual market plan coverage in 2016. Therefore, the aggregate r aw cost of this final rule over 10 years, $762 million (low estimate) and $1.3 billion (high estimate), is significantly below the 3 percent to 5 percent threshold for significant impact to commercial plans. We believe, that although a significant number of small plans under each program are affected by this rule, on average this impact is not significant. Additionally, we note that for those small entities that do find the cost of the provisions of this final rule burdensome, an exception process has been described in section III.C . of this final rule. Specifically, we note that w e may provide an exceptions process through which the FFEs may certify health plans that do not provide patient access through a standards- based API, but otherwise meet the requirements for QHP certificatio n. This process could apply for small issuers, issuers who are only in the individual or small group market, financially vulnerable issuers, or new entrants to the FFEs who demonstrate that deploying standards -based API technology consistent with the requi red interoperability 81 See \"Capitation payments & premiums\" in Table 17 of Appendix D in, Offi ce of the Actuary (Centers for Medicare and Medicai d Services). (2016). 2016 Actuarial Report on the Financial Out loo k for Medicaid. R etrieved from https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/finance/downloads/medicaid-a ctuarial -report-2 016.pdf. CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 407 s would pose a significant barrier to the issuer' s ability to provide coverage to c onsumers , and not certifying the issuer's QHP or QHPs would result in consumers having few or no plan options in certain areas. Consequently, the Secretary ha s determined that this final rule will not h ave a significant economi c impact on a substantial number of sm all entities and the requirement s of the RF A have been met. Please s ee our detailed analysi s of apportionment of cos ts per payer in Tables 6 through 13 and section XIII.H. of this final rule for furthe r details. In additi on, section 1102(b) of the Act requires CMS to prepare an RIA if a rule may have a significant impact on the operations of a substantia l numbe r of small rural hos pitals. Thi s analysis must conform to the provisions of section 604 of the RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small rural hospital as a hos pital that is located outsid e a Metropolitan Statistical Area and has fewer than 100 beds. We a re not preparing an analysis for section 1102(b) of the Act becau se we ha ve determined, and the Secretary certifies, that thi s final rule would not have a significant impac t on the operations of a substantial numbe r of smal l rural hospitals. Section 202 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA) (Pub. L. 104-04, enacted March 22, 1995) also require s that agenci es assess anticipated costs and benefit s before issuing a ny rule whose mandates , except those that are conditions of federal program participation , r equire spending in any 1 year of $1 00 milli on in 1995 dollars, update d annually for inflation. In 2020, that is approximately $156 million. This rule does not impose any such unfunded mandates. Executive Orde r 13132 establishes certain requirements that an agency must meet when it promulgates a proposed rule (and subsequent f inal r ule ) that imposes substantia l direct CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 408 requirement costs on state and local governments, preempt s state law, or otherwi se has federalis m implications. This final rule will not have a substantia l direct effect on state or local governments, preemp t state law, or othe rwise have a federalis m imp lication. Therefore, the requirements of Executive Order 13132 are not applicable. If regulations impose administrative costs, s uch as the time needed t o read and interpret this final rule, we should estimate the cost associated with regulatory review. There are currently 288 organizations and 56 states and territories . We assume each organization will have one designated staff member who w ill read the entire rule. Using the wage information from the BLS for medica l and health service managers (Code 11-9111) , we estimate that the cost of reviewing this rule is $139. 14 per hour, including overhead and fringe benefits (https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/naics5_524114.htm). Assuming an average reading speed, we estimate that it would take approximately 6 hours for each person to review this final rule. For each paye r that reviews the rule, the estimated cost is $834.84 (6 hours \u00d7 $13 9.14). Therefor e, we estimate that the total cost of r eviewing this regulation is $288,020 ($834.84 \u00d7 345 reviewers). 1. Requirements for Patient A ccess Through APIs To promote our commitment to interoperabilit y, we are implementing new requirements in section III. of this final rule for MA organizations at 42 CFR 422.119, Medicaid FFS at 42 CFR 431.60 , Medicai d managed care at 42 CFR 438.242, CHIP FFS at 42 CFR 457.730, CHIP managed care at 42 CFR 457.1233, and Q HP issuer s on the FFEs, excluding QHP issuers offering onl y SADPs or only F F-SHOP plans, at 45 CFR 156.221 to implement standards-based APIs for making certain data available to current enrollees. The Patien t Access API will p ermit third-party applications to retrieve data concerning adjudicated claims, encounters with capitated CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 409 providers, provider remittances, patient cost -sharing, a subset of clinical data including lab test results, if maintained by the payer, and, preferred drug lists, and for MA-PD plans only, formulary data that includes covered Part D drugs, and any tiered formulary structure or utilization management procedure, which pertains to those drugs for MA-PD plans. At 42 CFR 422.120 for MA organizations, at 42 CFR 431.70 for state Medicaid agencies, at 42 CFR 438.242(b)(6) for Medicaid managed care plans, at 42 CFR 457.760 for CHIP state agencies, and at 42 CFR 457.1233(d)(3) for CHIP managed care entities, we are finalizing the Provider Directory API. We believe that these policies are designed to empower patients by requiring that impacted payers take steps - by implementing the two required APIs - to enable enrollees to have access to their data in a usable digital format and have (potentially) easier means to share that data. By making these data readily available and portable to the patient, these initiatives may help patie nts have the ability to move from payer to payer, provider to provider, and have both their clinical and administrative information travel with them throughout their health care journey. Payers are in a unique position to provide enrollees with a comprehensive picture of their claims and encounter data, allowing patients to piece together their own information that might otherwise be lost in disparate systems. This information can contribute to better informed decision making, helping to inform the patient's choice of coverage options and care providers to more effectively manage their own health, care, and costs. By encouraging them to take charge of and better manage their health and having access to their health information, patients will have the ability to share this information with their other providers, which may reduce duplication of services, add efficiency to provider visits, and facilitate identification of fraud, waste, and abuse. To estimate the number of impacted payers, we reviewed parent or ganizations of health CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 410 plans across MA organizations , M edicaid MCOs, and QHP issuer s on the FFEs to remove organizations that would not be subject to the policy, such as issuers that offer only SADPs; transportation plans, a nd brokers such as non-emergency m edical transportation (NEMTs) brokers; PACE; visiting nurse and home health care organizations; senior organizations such as Area Agencies on Aging; and other organizations such as communit y action programs . After removing these organizations, w e then re viewed the remaining na m es of parent organizations and health plans in the N ationa l Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC ) Consumer I nformati on Support (CIS) system to determine the legal name of the entity and whether the entity w as registered with t he NAIC. We also used the 2018 NAIC Listing of Companies to determine whether various health plans had associated parent organization s usi ng the NAIC's Group coding and numbering system. If the health plan or parent organization did not appear in the NAIC CIS or in the 2018 NAIC Listing of Companies, we then reviewed the name of the entity in the Securities and Exchange online Edgar system t o locate the entity's Form 10- K filing, which includes an Exhibi t (Exhibi t 21) t hat requires the entity to list its subsidiaries. If the health pla n or organization did not appear in these online systems or listings, an online internet search using Google search engine was conducted. After review, we have determine d that 288 issuers and 56 states, territories, a nd U.S. commonwealths, which operate FFS programs, will be subject to the API provisions for Medicare, Medicaid, and QHP issuers on the FFEs. To this we add the one state that operat es its CHIP and Medicaid separately. Thus, we have a total of 345 parent organizations (288+56+1). We note that although 42 states have some lower- income children in an expansi on of Medicaid, and some higher-income children or pregnant women in a separate CHIP, all but one of these programs are operated out of the same agency. Although the CHIP programs may be distinct, we believe they will use the same infrastructure built for CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 411 Medicaid. Thus, the addition of 1 parent organization for CHIP is reasonable and plausible. As noted in section XII.C.3. of this final rule , to implement the Patient Ac cess A PI together with the payer-to-paye r data exchange policies to facilitate a paye r maintaining a cumulative health record for their current enrollees , we est imated that organizations and states would conduc t three major work phases : initial design; development and testing; and long- term s upport of the APIs, including increased data storage, such as additional servers, or cloud storage to s tore patient health information a nd maintain it, and allocation of resources to maintain the FHIR server, and pe rform capability and security testing. (For a de tailed description of these phases, see section XII.C.3. of this final rule.) As part of our research into the regulatory impact, we reviewed a sampl e of health plan organizations offering MA plans to determine whethe r any currently offer patien t portal functionality with the MA pl an. If yes, we reviewed whether they offered the oppor tunity to connect t o Medicare's Blue Button 2.0. Healt h plan organizations offering M A plans were identified from June 2018 data and statistics compiled at https://www.cms.gov/Research - Statistics -Data -and- Systems/Statistics -Trends-and-Reports/MCRAdvPartDEnrolData/index.html. We initiall y reviewe d the functionality offered by three organizations, which together enroll over half of MA members through review of publicly-available information such as pr ess releas es and website informationa l materials. We found from this review that these organizations not only offered patient portals primarily focused on claims and user- entered data on t heir website, but that all three also offered enrollees the oppor tunity to connect to Blue Button. We then identified a selection of other health plan organizations at random and conducted the same evaluation. Results indicate that the majority of the hea lth plan organizations we reviewed offer patients a way to access claims data and other i nformation via their w ebsites and sometimes via CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 412 applications. We a lso cross-referenced health plan organizations offering MA pl ans with health plan organiza tions that offer plans in the Federa l Empl oyees Health Benefits (FEHB ) Program be cause a p ercentage of those organization s offer plans with patient portal access and Blue Button functionality. The FEHB Program, administered by the Office of Personnel Manage ment (OPM), reporte d in 2014 that 90 percent of its participating plans offered enrollees access to a personal health record on the organization's website . In addition, OPM reporte d that over half of the FEHB participati ng plans expected to offer Blue Button functionalit y by January 1, 2016. We sought to learn whether there was any overlap between these two lists of organizations to gauge whethe r additiona l organizations may a lready ha ve the capability to offer either patient portals or Blue Button, albeit in a different busine ss arm, as ha ving internal capability may assuage some of the cost of building out a new API to support patient access to claims data. While we found significant overlap between UnitedHealthcare and t he Blue Cross Blue Shield Affiliates, we also were a ble to ide ntify other organizations that offer both MA p lans and plans included in the FEHB. While not definitive, this data allows us to draw the conclusi on that a number of health plan organizations have the technology in place to offer patient portals to MA e nrollees and, further, also ha ve the ability to offer MA enrollees Blue Button functionality. As detailed in section XII. of this final rule and summarize d in Table 5, given the current state of interoperability, we est imate the burden related to the new requirements for APIs to have an initial set one-time costs of $788, 414 per implementati on or an aggregate cost of $272 million ($788,414 x 345 parent organizations) minimu m estimate ; an initia l one-time cost of $1,576,829 per organization or state or an aggregate cost of $544 milli on ($1,576,829 x 345 parent organizations) p rimary a nd, an initia l one-time organization or CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 413 organization or an aggregate $816 million ($2,365,243 x 345 parent organizations) high estimate. For a detailed discussion of the one- time costs associated with implementing the API requirements we refer readers to section XII.C.3. of this final rule . Once the API is established, we believe that there will be an annual cost for performing necessary capability and security testing, performing necessary upgrades, vetting of third-party applications, and maintaining patient health information. We estimate the burden related to the requirements for APIs to have an annual cost of $157,657 per implementation or an aggregate cost of $54 million (345 parent organizations x $157,657). For a detailed discussion of the annual costs associated with implementing the API requirements, we refer readers to section XII.C.3. of this final rule . We are com mitted to fulfilling our role in promoting interoperability, putting patients first and ensuring they have access to their health care data. We recognize that there are significant opportunities to modernize access to patient data and its ability to share across the health ecosystem. We realize the importance of interoperability and the capability for health information systems and software applications to communicate, exchange, and interpret data in a usable and readable format. Although allowing access to health care data through pdf and text format is vital, it limits the utility of the data, and its ability to be easily accessed and shared. Additionally, we realize that moving to a system in which patients have access to their health care data will ultimately empower them to make informed decisions about their health care. Our policies here do not go as far as our goals for how patients will be ultimately empowered, but take steps in that direction. We note that the federal government has spent over $35 billion under the EHR Incentive CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 414 Programs82 to incentivize the adoption of EHR systems; however, despite the fact that 78 percent of physicians and 96 percent of hospitals now use an EHR system,83 progress on system- wide data sharing has been limited. Previous attempts to advance interoperability have made incremental progress but have failed to align the necessary stakeholders to drive momentum in a single direction. In 2018, the Administration launched the MyHealthEData initiative. 84 This government-wide initiative aims to empower patients by ensu ring that they have access to their own health care data and the ability to decide how their data will be used, while keeping that information safe and secure. MyHealthEData aims to break down the barriers that prevent patients from gaining electronic acce ss to their health care data and allow them to access that data from the device or application of their choice that will connect to a plan's API, empowering patients and taking a critical step toward interoperability and patient data exchange. Payers shou ld have the ability to exchange data instantly with other payers for care coordination or transitions, and with providers to facilitate more efficient care. Payers are in a unique position to provide enrollees a complete picture of their claims and encount er data, allowing patients to piece together their own information that might otherwise be lost in disparate systems. We are committed to solving the issue of interoperability and achieving complete patient access in the U.S. health care system and are tak ing an active approach using all available policy levers and authorities available to move all participants in the health care market 82 Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

These buy-in data exchanges support state, CMS, and SSA premium accounting, collections, and enrollment functions. CMS subregulatory guidance , specificall y Chapter 3 of the State Buy-in Manual, specifi es that states should exchange buy-in da ta with CMS at least monthly, but provides the option for states to exchange buy-in data with CMS daily or weekly. Likewise, states can choos e to receiv e the CMS response data on a file daily or monthly. We are establishing the frequency requirements in the regulation itself to require all s tates to participate in daily exchange of buy-in data to CMS, with \"daily\" meaning every business day, but that if no new transactions are available to transmit, data would not need to be submitted on a given business day. States will be required to begin participating in daily exchange of buy-in data with CMS by April 1, 2022. To estimate impact, w e first note that there a re a total of 51 entities, consisting of the 50 states and the District of Columbia that can be affected by buy-in. Currently, 25 entities (24 states and the Distric t of Columbia ) now subm it buy-in data files to CMS daily and 32 entities (31 states and the Distric t of C olumbia ) receive buy-in data files from CMS daily. Consequently, we expect a one-time burden for 26 s tates (51 total entities minus 25 entities currently s ubmitting daily buy-in data) to comply with the daily buy-in data submissions, and a similar one-t ime CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 416 burden for 19 states (51 total entities minus 32 entities currently receiving buy -in data) to comply with the receipt of daily buy- in data. These numbers changed from those in the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access proposed rule to reflect the most current data available to CMS as of July 1, 2019. Between July 1 and publication of the final rule it is likely that the numbers may change more. However, as can be seen from Table 5, this aspect of the rule has minor impact (only a few million dollars) compared with the overall impact of the rule (several hundred million). Consequently, we are using these July 1 numbers in the final rule. We estimate that each required change, whether to submit buy -in data or receive buy-in data, would take 6 months of work (approximately 960 hours) by a programmer working at an hourly rate of $90.02 per hour. Since there are 45 required changes (19 states that need to comply with receiving data plus 26 states that need to comply with submitting data) we estimate an aggregate burden of $3,888,864 (45 changes * 960 hours of programming work * $90.02/hour). The cost per state per change is ap proximately $85,000 (960 * $90.02 = $86,419 exactly) and the costs for both changes (to both send and receive buy-in data daily would be approximately $170,000 (2 * $85,000). We did not estimate any savings related to exchanging buy- in data with greater frequency, as data lags only delay when states are billed for premium costs; delays do not impact the applicability date and total costs. While we did not estimate premium savings (since premium collection is ultimately correct), we anticipate that states may experience longer term reduction in administrative burden of making those corrections. As noted in section XII.C. of this final rule, we are updating the frequency requirements CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 417 in 42 CFR 423.910(d) to require that starting April 1, 2022, all states submit the required MMA file data to CMS daily, and to make conforming edits to 42 CFR 423.91 0(b)(1). Daily would mean ever y business day, but that if no new transactions are available to transmit, data would not need to be submitted on a given business day. As noted in section XII.C. of this final rule, the e stimated burden across impacted states is $3,111, 091. Thus, the total burden to comply with increased frequency of submission of MMA files and increased frequenc y of submission and receipt of da ily buy-in data files is $7 million ($3,888,864 total cost for the buy-in provision plus $3,111,091 total cost for the MMA file requirements). We e st imate a 25- mont h implementation period for these system upda tes, from March 2020 to a nd including March 2022. In the CMS Interoperability and Patient A ccess proposed rule, we assumed a 3-year implementation period reflecting a May 1st start date and an April 1, 2022 applicability date . The revise d 25-mont h implementation period reflects an expected publicati on of this final rule in March 2020, with implementation beginning March 2020, and with the applicability date of April 1, 2022 unchanged. Although the implementati on period is shorter (25 months versus 36 months) the purpose of the 25-month window is to give organiza tions flexibility in finding a 6-month period to perform upda tes as indicate d in section XII. of th is final rule. A lthough the flexibility window for this 6-month period is shortened (plans have less c hoice of which 6 months to work in), data are la cking with which t o refine the cost estimat es to reflect the shortened complianc e period. States will have the ability to choose, in consultation with CMS, when in the 25-month implementation period they w ant to make this change, with numerous factors impacting in which year they would do so. For the purposes of this impact analysis, we estimated a uniform CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 418 distributi on beginni and endi ng in April 2022 as calculated in Table 5. Therefore, since, as noted above, the total cost impact over 25 months is $7 million, when apportione d uniformly over the 25 months, the resulti ng impacts $2.8, $3.4, and and 2022 respectively correspondi ng to 10 months, 12 months, and 3 months in 2020, 2021 and 2022 respectively. These calculations are transparently presented in Table 5. 3. Revisions to the C onditions of Participation for Hospitals and Critica l Access Hospitals (CAHs) We are expanding CMS ' requirements for interoperability w ithin the hospita l and CAH CoPs by focusing on electronic patient event notifications . We are implementing new requirements in s ection X. of this final rule for hospitals at 42 CFR 482.24(d), for psychiatric hospitals at 42 CFR 482.61(f), a nd for CAHs at 42 CFR 485.638(d). Specifically, for hospitals, psychiatric hospitals, and CAHs, we are finalizing simila r requirements to revise the CoPs for Medicare- and Medicaid-participating hospitals , psychiatric hospitals, and CAHs by adding a new standard, \"Electroni c Notifications,\" that will requi r e hospitals, psychiatric hospitals, and CAH s to make electroni c patient event notifications availabl e to applicable pos t-acute care services providers and suppliers, and to community practitioners, suc h as the patient's established primary care pr actitioner, established primary care practice group or entity, or other pr actitione r or pra ctice group or entity identified by the pa tient as primarily responsible for his or her care. We are limiting this requirement to only those hospitals, psychiatric hospitals , and CAHs that utilize electronic medica l records systems, or other electronic administrative systems, which are conformant with the content exchange standar d at 45 CFR 170.205(d)(2), recognizing that not a ll Medicare - and Medicaid- participating hos pitals h ave been eligible for past programs promoting adoption of EHR systems. If the hospital's (or CAH's) system conforms to the CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 419 content exchange standard at 45 CFR 170.205( d)(2), the hospital (or CAH) must then demonstrate that its system's notification capacity is fully operationa l and that it ope rates in accordan ce with all state and federal statut es and regulations regarding the exchange of patient health information, and that its system, to the extent permissible unde r applicable federa l and state law and regulations, and not inconsistent with the patient's expressed privacy preferences, sends the notifications either directly, or through an int ermediary that facilitates exchange of health information. It must also demonstrate that the notifications include at least patient name, treating practitioner name, and sending institution name. Upon the patient's registration in the emergency department or admission to inpatient services, and a lso either immediately prior to, or at the time of, the pa tient's discha rge or transfer (from the emergency department or inpatient services), the hospita l (or CAH ) must also demonstrate that it has made a reasonable e ffort to ensur e that it s system sends the notifications to all applicable post-acute c are services pr ovider s and suppliers, as well as to any of the following practitioners and entities, which need to receive notification of the patient's status for treatment, care c oordination, or quality improvement purposes : (1) the patient's established primary care practitioner ; (2) the patient's established primary c are practice group or entity; or (3) other practitioner, or other practice group or entity, identified by the patient as the practitioner, or practice group or entity, primarily responsible for his or her c are. A s we noted, infrastructure s upporting the exchange of electronic health information acros s settings has matured substantially in recent years. Research studi es have increasingly found that health information exchange interventions can effectuate positive outcomes in health care quality and public health outcomes, i n addition t o more longstanding findings around reductions in utilization and costs. Electronic patient event notifications from hospitals, or CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 420 clinical event notifications, are one type of health information exchange intervention that has been increasingly recognized as an effective and scalable tool for improving care coordination across settings, especially for patients at discharge. This approach has been identified with a reduction in readmiss ions following implementation. 85 In additi on, the CMS Innovation Center has been partnering with states through the State Innovation Models Initiative to advance multi- payer health care payment and delivery system reform models. Through this initiative 34 states have been awarded over $900 million to implement their respective State Health Care Innovation Plans, many of which included enhancements in HIT and HIE. While these models are ongoing, evaluation reports thus far are reporting that many states are experiencing favorable outcomes on ED visit rates and other quality measures. 86 Although patient event notifications are only a small piece of these models, we want to continue the momentum towards nationwide adoption. These notifications are automated, electronic communications from the provider to applicable post- acute care services providers and suppliers, and also to community practitioners identified by the patient. These automated communications alert the receiving provider or practitioner that the p atient has received care at a different setting. Information included with these notifications can range from simply conveying the patient's name, basic demographic information, and the sending institution, to a richer set of clinical data depending upon t he level of technical implementation. Even with a minimum set of information included, these notifications can help ensure that a receiving provider or community practitioner is aware that 85 Unruh, M. A., Jung, H., Kaushal, R., & Vest, J. R. (2017). Hospitalization event notifications and reductions in readmissions of Medicare fee -for-service beneficiaries in the Bronx, New York. Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association, 24(e1), e150 -e156. doi: 10.1093/jamia/ocw139. 86 Centers e and Medicaid Services. ( 2019, D ecember 6). State Innovation Models Initiative: 03/06/20 421 the patient h as received care elsewhere. The not ification trigger s a receiving provider or practitione r to re ach out to the pa tien t to delive r appropriate follow -up care in a timely manner. By providing timely notifications , the alert may improve post-discharg e transitions and reduce the likelihood of complications result ing from inadequate follow-up care. We believe that care coordination can have a significant positive impact on the quality of life, consumer experience, and health outcomes for patients . As we have noted in the preamble to this rule, v irtually all EHR systems (as well as o lder legacy electroni c administrative systems, such a s electronic patient registrations s ystems, and which we are including in this final rule) ge nerate the basic messages commonly used to support electronic patient event notifications. In addition, w hile we a cknowledge that some l evel of implementation cost would be realized f or those providers not already sending notifications , we also note there is also substantial agreement that implementation of these ba sic messaging and notification functions within suc h existing system s constitut es a relatively l ow cost burden for providers, particularly when suc h costs are considered alongside the innovative and beneficial patient care transition solutions and models for best practices they provide. As detailed in section XI., we estimat e that the total cost imposed on hospitals, psychiatric hospitals, and CAHs by these provisions to be approximatel y $5,179,863 in the first year and $1,042,426 in subsequent years. 4. Effects of O the r Policy Changes In addition to those policy changes discussed previously that we are able to model, we are finalizing various other changes in this final rule. Generally, we have limited or no specific data available with w hich to estimate the impacts of the polic y changes. Our estimates of the likely impacts a ssociated with these o ther changes a re discussed in this s ection. CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 422 a. Care Coordination Across Payers The majority of the 64 million people on Medicare are covered by FFS, however, about 34 percent are covered in MA plans. Since 2003, the number of beneficiaries enrolled in MA plans has increased fivefold from 4.6 million in 2010 to 22 million in 2019.87 Given the growth in MA enrollment and the ability for MA beneficiaries to change plans, we believe it is important to supporting efficient care coordination by requiring the sharing of key patient health information when an enrollee requests it. Therefore, we are requiring MA organizations, Medicaid managed care plans, CHIP managed care entities, and QHP issuer s on the FFEs to maintain a process for the electronic exchange of, at a minimum, the data classes and elements included in the content standard finalized by HHS in the ONC 21st Century Cures Act final rule (published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register ) at 45 CFR 170.213 (currently version 1 of the USCDI), via a payer- to-payer data exchanged as outlined in this section V. of this final rule. Furthermore, we are finalizing as proposed a regulatory requirement at 42 CFR 422.119(f)(1) and 438.62(b)(1)(vi), and at 45 CFR 156.221(f)(1) to require MA organizations, Medicaid managed care plans, CHIP managed care entities, and QHP issuers on the FFEs to incorporate the data they receive into the payer's record about the enrollee. We are also finalizing that with the approval and at the direction of an enrollee, a payer must send the defined informatio n set to any other payer. W e specify that a payer is only obligated to send data received from another payer under this policy in the electronic form and format it was received. However, we have noted that such transactions will need to be made in compliance with any other applicable laws. 87 Medicare Payment Advisory Commission. (2019, J uly 19). A Data Book: Healt h Care Spending and the Medicare Program - June 2019. R e trieved from http://www.medpac.gov/docs/default -source/data - book/jun19_databook_entirereport_sec.pdf?sfvrsn=0. CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 423 We believe that sending and receiving these data will help both plan enrollees and health care p roviders in coordinating care and reduci ng administrative burden. We believe that this entails utilizing all tools available t o us to ensure that plans provide coordinated high- quality care in an efficient and cost- effective way that prot ects progra m integrity. Leveraging interoperability t o facilitate care coordination among plans can, with thoughtful execution, significantly reduce unnecessary care, as well as e nsure that health care provider s are able to spend their time providi ng care rather than performing unnecessary adminis trative tasks. For instance, ef fective informati on exchange between plans could improve care coordination by reducing the need for health care provider s to write unne eded letter s of medical necessity; by reducing instanc es of inappropriate step therapy; and by reducing repeated utilization reviews , risk screenings, and assessments. We believe that this policy will impose minima l additiona l costs on plans. W e note that we are not specifying a transport standard and anticipate that plans ma y opt to use APIs, s uch as the Patient Access A PI that this final rul e also requires. We also anticipat e that plans may choose to ut ilize a regiona l health information exchange. We believe it is difficul t to quantify the i mpact of this change because plans will likely implem ent different transport methods, and we cannot predict the selected method plans will choose. b. Care Coordination Through Trusted Exchange Networks In section VI. of the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access proposed rule, we proposed requiring MA organization, Medicaid managed care plans, CHIP managed care entities, and QHP issuers on the FFEs to participate in trust networks in order to improve interoperability. We also listed the requirements for participation in a trusted exchange network. CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 424 As a result of comments and re-examination of our desired policies, we have decided not to finalize this provision. However, as pointed out in the proposed rule, had this provision been finalized, it would impose minimal additional costs on plans. Consequently, not finalizing this policy does not impact this RIA. 5.Non-Mandatory Effects and Regulatory Interaction We note in this RIA when we had difficulty quantifying costs due to lack of applicable research or data. More specifically, the establishment of a healt h care information ecosystem could only be achieved with new actions that are conducted widely throughout the health care field\u2014including by entities, especially non-hospital providers, for whom costs have not been estimated in either this RIA or the RIA for the accompanying ONC 21st Century Cures Act final rule (published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register). Although data limitations have prevented the quantification of these costs, the benefits of the two rules\u2014some of which have been quantif ied in the ONC RIA\u2014and the rules' potential transfer impacts \u2014including reductions in fraudulent payments, as discussed by Parente et al. (2008) 88\u2014are largely contingent upon such costs being incurred. Additionally, there are ongoing regulatory and policy activities outside of this final rule that might influence the rule's impact in an unquantifiable manner. When possible, we acknowledge these complexities as well. D.Alternatives Considered In March 2018, the White House Office of American Innovation and the CMS Administrator announced the launch of MyHealthEData, and CMS's direct, hands- on role in improving patient access and advancing interoperability. As part of the MyHealthEData 88 Parente, Stephen T., Karen Mandelbaum, Susan P . Hanson, Bonni e S. Cassidy and Donald W. Simborg. \"Crime and Punishment: Can the NHIN Reduce the Cost o f Healthcar e Fraud ?\" Journal of Healthcare Information Management 22(3): 42-51. June 2008. CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 425 initiative , we are taking a patient-centered approach to health information access a nd moving t o a system in which patients have immediate access to their electronic health informati on and can be assured that their health information will follow them as they move throughout the health care syste m from provide r to provider, p aye r to payer. T his final rule contains a range of policies. It provides descriptions of the statutor y provisions that are addressed, identifies the policies, and present s rational es for our decisions and, wher e relevant, alternative s that were considered. We carefull y considere d alternatives to the policies we are adopting in this final rule but concluded that none of the alternatives would adequately and immediately begi n to address the critical issue s of the l ack of patient acc ess a nd interoperability, or the difficulty exchanging health care data within the health care system. As we noted in the CMS Interoperability and Patient A ccess p roposed rule, we believe the following three attributes of standards- based APIs a re particularly importan t to achieving the goal of of fering individuals convenient access, through applications they choose, to available and relevant electroni c health and health -related information: th e API technologi es themselves, not just th e data accessible through them, are standardized; the APIs are technically transparent; and the APIs a re implemented in a pro-competitive manner (84 FR 7620) . The API requirements proposed and finalize d in this rule were developed to ensure the se goa ls are met. Some of the reasons that we selected the FHIR s tandard were due to the flexibility it provides and the wide industry adoption that it offers. The open and extensible nature of FHIR allows for health care integration to be transparent and accessible. FHIR is ope n sour ce, and as such, it has garnered a community that includes developers and vendors . For example, large consumer brands are becoming a driving force behind the adoption of FHIR. Apple is implementing FHIR in Apple Health as part of iOS 11.3, and serves as a member of the CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 426 Argonaut Project and Accelerators;89 Google supports FHIR by partnering with HL7, as well as through its membership in the CARIN Alliance; and Microsoft published an Azure API for FHIR to create and deploy FHIR service health data solutions.90 Furthermore, according to an ONC report, nearly 51 percent of health IT developers appear to be using a version of FHIR combined with OAuth 2.0 to respond to requests for patient data. Additionally, of the hospitals and Merit- based Incentive Payment System (MIPS) eligible clinicians that use certified products, almost 87 percent of hospitals and 69 percent of MIPS eligible clinicians are served by health IT developers with product(s) certified to any FHIR version. 91 For additional ways to allow consumers access to their health data, we note that we did receive comments that CMS could consider allowing payers and providers to upload patient data directly to a patient portal that is owned and managed by the patient. One option would allow for HIEs and HINs to serve as a central source for patients to obtain aggregated data in a single location. While HIEs and HINs can provide patients with valuable information via a portal, research has indicat ed that portals have not gained widespread use by patients. According to ONC, as of 2017, 52 percent of individuals have been offered online access to their medical records by a health provider or payer. Of the 52 percent that were offered access, only hal f of 89 The HL7 FHIR Accelerator Program is designed to assist communities and collaborative groups across the global health care spectrum in the creation and adoption of high quality FHIR Implementation Guides or other standard artifacts to move toward the realizatio n of global health data interoperability.

State of the Healthcare API Econom y (An Innovation Forum Sessi on: Session 217). R e trieve d from Baker, W. ( 2018, October 1). Heat Wave: The U.S. is Poised to Catch FHIR in viewed their record.92 Additionally, we believe that there would be additional burden associated with using portals because providers and patients would need to access multiple portals and websites to access patient data, instead of a single app . Unlike portals that would require developers to link systems or ensure system- level compatibility, FHIR -based APIs have the ability to make data available without the need to link multiple systems or portals and would provide a patient a single -point of access to their data. Having APIs that can be accessed by third -party apps permits the patient to choose how they want to access their data, and it promotes innovation in industry to find ways to best help patients interact with their data in a way that is most meaningful and helpful to them. Additionally, we believe it would be very difficult to evaluate the cost impacts of making individual portals available via an HIE or HIN because business models and process are varied, and there is a lack of standardi zation in the way the information is stored and transmitted across HIEs and HINs. Other alternatives that we considered were how broadly or narrowly to apply the policies and requirements. For example, we could have required health plans to provide more data elements via a standards-based API then just data for adjudicated claims, encounters with capitated providers, provider remittances, beneficiary cost -sharing, clinical data including laboratory results, provider directories (and pharmacy directories for MA -PDs), and preferred drug lists, where applicable . In the CMS Interoperability proposed rule, we originally required MA organizations, state Medicaid FFS programs, Medicaid managed care plans, CHIP FFS programs, and CHIP managed care entities to make available provider directory data through the Patient Access API (84 FR 7633) and publicly available to current and prospective enrollees (84 92 Patel, V. & Johnson, C. (2018, April). Individuals' Use of Online Medical Reco rds and Technolog y f or Health Needs (ONC Data Brief No. After consideration of public comments, we have removed the requirements that these impacted payer s mak e provide r directory information available through the Patien t Access API. M A organizations, state Medicaid FFS programs, Medicai d managed care plans, CHIP FFS programs, and CHIP managed care entities will only need t o make provider directory informati on available via a publicly accessible Provide r Directory API. We note the Provider Directory API does not need to conform to the security protocols finalized by HHS at 45 CFR 170.215(a)(3) and (b) that are specific to authenticating users and confirming individu als' authorization or reques t to di sclose their persona l information to a specific application through an API, namely the SMART IG (using the OAuth 2.0 standard) and OpenID Connect Core 1.0. By only requiring the P rovide r Directory API make these otherwis e publ i cly acc essibl e data available, we are seeking to avoid duplicative effort and additional burden. Additionally, several commenters suggested additional information be added to the requiremen t for provide r directory information to be available through a n API, such as NPIs for individual and group providers, practice group name, health system name, as well as the specific plan(s) and tiers a provider participates in \"provider demographics;\" whether the provider is accepting new patients; and information about which providers are in-network for a plan by geography and/or specialty. While we agreed with commenters that this informati on would be helpful to patients, we did not modify the proposed requirements for the informati on that is required to be made available by the Provider Directory API becaus e we believ e additional data would be a cost driver. By not adding additional require d information we are seeking to minimize the burden for the regulated payers that must comply with this policy. Instead we are identifying a minimum set of pr ovide r directory i nformation that aligns with existing requirements applicable to MA organizations (including MA organizations that o ffer MA-PD CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 429 plans), state Medicaid and CHIP FFS programs, Medicaid managed care plans, and CHIP managed care entities that beneficiaries can currently access. We a lso looked at policy alternative s related to specifi c aspect s of the API requirements. For instance, we considered whether to modify the requirement to make claims and encounter data, as well as clinical data, ava ilabl e through the Patient Ac cess A PI no later than one (1) busine ss da y af ter a pa yer receive s it. We reviewed several suggested alternative s such as increasing the timefram e to three (3) or five (5) busine ss da ys to account for vendor-adjudicated claims. Whil e we c onsidered these a lternatives, we ultimately decided not to adjust the proposed requirements because having access to this information within one (1) business day could empowe r patients to ha ve the information they ne ed, when they need it to inform care coordination. Patients have a right to see the full lifecycle of their claims and encounter informati on as soon as it is available , even if the payment amounts may change due t o appeal. Additionally, as we noted in sec tion XII. of th is final rule, the burden related to API requirements is in the in itia l implementation of the syste m to make this information available in one (1) business day once receive d. This requirement is being implemented in the design and build phas e and the system updat e cost for electroni c availability would be the same regardless of the number of da ys the system is set up to accommodate. There is also no data on whether providi ng three (3) or five (5) days, versus one (1) day, will provide patients with more complete or accurate data. As an al ternative, we considered requiring all QHP issuer s on al l Exchange s to meet the new API requirements a s part of Q HP certification. Consistent with some other QHP certificati on requirements, we opted not to require SBEs to include this as part of their certification requirements, but we strongly urge them to do so to ensure equitable treatment of CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 430 issuers nationally a nd to allow consumers to access their health information through a third-party applicati on no ma tter wher e they are insured acros s the country. States are the most knowledgeable a bout their consumer s and insuranc e markets and are responsible for issuer compliance activities. While we believe that these API requirements have the potentia l to provide great benefit to consumers , complying with them will be mainly operational and SBE states would be required t o asses s QH P issuer compliance. Therefore, we believ e that SBE states should be given the flexibility to determine whether or not these requirements are required of their QHP issuers. An additional alternativ e that w e considered was based of f one commenter' s suggestion to inc entivize plans who meet the required implementation dates through highe r Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) scores. Although the commenter was not clear regarding a specifi c recommendation as to how to implement change s to the HEDIS score, we evaluated options such as adding a new measure specific to data exchange using HL7 FHIR- based APIs between payer s and third -parties on the behalf of patients, or adding bonus points to the total score or so me appropriate measure set for implementing the FHIR -based APIs required. However, after further evaluation, we believe that this is not a viable alternative at this time. CMS cannot give a higher HEDIS score for using a digital specification because it would not be an accurate measur e of plan performance. T o consider adding a bonus t o the highest rating if the plan meet s certain standards would necessitat e requiring a new adjustmen t to the star rating methodology. This would be a significant change to how the current star ratings are calculate d and would have to be proposed through notice and comment rulemaki ng. Given the implementation date for the API provisions for MA or ganizations, Medicaid FFS programs, Medicaid managed care plans, CHIP FFS programs, and CHIP managed care e ntities i s January CMS-9115-F CPL 03/06/20 431 1, 2021, and for QHP issuers on the FFEs beginning with plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2021, i mplementing change s to the star ratings would not be achievable within the available timefram e to incentivi ze implementation as the commenter suggested. As we recogni ze that advancing interoperability is no small or simpl e m atter, we continue to explore alternatives and pote ntial future policies. In the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access pr oposed rule, we requeste d comment for consideration in future rulemaki ng or subregulatory guidance on a number of alternatives relate d to whether additional policies or requirements, beyond those proposed, should be impose d to promote interoperability. For example, the CMS Innovation Center sought comment on general principles around promoting interoperability as part of the design and testing of innovative payment and service delivery models. Additionally, we sought comment on how we may leverage our program authorit y to provide support to those working on improving patient matching. For example, we requested comment on whether CMS should requir e impacted payer s use a pa rticular patient m atching software solution wit h a proven success rate of a certain percentage validated by HHS or a third party. W e also noted that we wi ll continue to consider feedback received from RFIs issued in various rules over the course of the past 2 years and incorporate those suggestions into our strategy. We thank commenters for their input on thes e RFIs. We will conside r the comments received for potential future rulemaking. E. Accounting Statement and Table In accordan ce with OMB Circular A- 4, Table 14 depi cts an accounting statement summarizing the assessment of the benefits, cos ts, and transfer s associated with this regulatory action. CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 432 TABLE 14: Accounting Statement Category Primary Estimate Units Year dollars Discount Rate Period Covered Benefits Qualitative API requirements will alleviative the burden for patients to go through separate processes to obtain access to each system, and the need to manually aggregate information that is delivered in various, often non -standardized, formats ( not necessarily additional to the benefits assessed in the RIA for the accompanying ONC21st Century Cures Act final rule, (published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register)). API requirement allows for the administration of a more efficient and e ffective Medicaid program by taking advantage of commonly used methods of information sharing and data standardization. API requirements would help to create a health care information ecosystem that allows and encourages the health care market to tailor pr oducts and services to compete for patients, thereby increasing quality, decreasing costs, providing potential benefits (not necessarily additional to the benefits assessed in the RIA for the accompanying ONC final rule), and helping them live better, heal thier lives. Privacy and security policies are being implemented that permit payers to request third -party apps to attest to privacy and security provisions prior to providing the app access to the payer's API. Costs Annualized Monetized $ millions/year (low estimate) Costs: Non-hospital provider costs associated with development of a broad health care information ecosystem (regulatory benefits and fraud reduction are largely contingent upon these non -mandatory costs being incurred). Transfers from the Federal Government to Enrollees of Commercial Plans (PTC) Annualized Monetized $ millions 5.4 2019 7% 2020 -2029 Annualized Monetized $ millions 5.5 2018 3% 2020 -2029 Non-Quantified Transfers: Reduced fraudulent payments to providers from the federal government and other payers. The preceding discussion was an act ual cost impact (not a t ransfer) sinc e goods and computer services are being paid for. Plans have the option of transferring their expenses to CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 433 enrollees. In practice, becaus e of market competitive forces a plan may decide to operate a t a (partia l) lo ss and not transfe r the e ntire cost. It is important to estimate the maximum the transfer could be. Some costs are transferred to the states (for Medicaid and CHIP) and ultimately to the federa l gove rnmen t (for Medicare , Medicaid, and CHIP , and potentially for QHP issuers on the FFEs in the form o f hi gh e r PTCs), mitigating the amount transferred to enrollees. O ne approach t o estimat e impact on enroll ees w as made in section X II.B. of this RIA. However, this analys is did not take into account transfers. We now re-estimate the potential full transfer. As noted in Tables 5 through 10, we have in 2021 through 2029 under a dollar increase in premiums as the worst-case scenario, and we used actual costs per year. In this alternat e analysis, we use actual amount s for each of 2021 through 2029 with the initial 1-year cost amortized over 9 years. In other words, we assume a n a ggregate annual cost of $84.6 million ($272 million / 9 + $54.4 million), this is based on the low estimate 1st year cost of $272 million. If we use the high estimate cost $816 million we obtain $145 million average ($816 million / 9 + $54.4 million). We note that this premium increase could be counterbalanced by projected savings arising from the provisions in this final rule. More spe cifically, we expect the availability of portable electronic transfe r of medica l data proposed by this rule will help patient s have the ability t o move from payer to payer , provider t o provider , and have both their clinical and administrative information trave l with them throughout their health care journey. Allowing patients to piece togethe r their ow n information that might otherwise be l os t in disparate systems could hel p make better informed patients and may lea d to increase prevention of future medical illnesses due to improvements in care coordination due to better data accessibility. The savings from avoiding one illness or one cheaper procedure would offset the under one-d ollar impact. CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 434 However, we have no way, at th is point, of estimating this aspect of the future savings of the rule. We present two estimates. First, we estimate using the enrollment figures used in Table 9 of this RIA. Table 9 shows that we have 110.5 million enrollees (17.5+73+20) in programs that will be spending about $84.6 million per year. Ignoring federal subsidies, and assuming that all costs will be passed on to enrollees (which is contrary to our experience), the 110.5 million enrollees would each incur an extra 77 cents per enrollee ($84.6 m illion /110.5 million) a year to achieve the $84.6 million goal. This is the low estimate cost. The corresponding high estimate cost would be $1.31 per enrollee per year ($145 million /110.5 million). We next estimate using premium versus enrollment as was done in section XII .B. of this RIA. Prior to discussing potential transfers to enrollees, we discuss how this final rule may affect patients not covered by plans subject to this rule. It is both possible and likely that an organization offering a plan subject to this rule may also offer plans not subject to this rule, and comply with the requirements of this rule for all of its plans, including those not subject to this rule. Consequently, it is possible that to cover the cost of complying with this rule f or plans that are subject to this rule and plans that are not subject to this rule, organizations may raise premiums for their plans that are subject to this rule and their plans that are not subject to this rule. It is possible (and we contend likely) tha t this final rule will affect enrollees in individual market plans other than QHPs on the FFEs, even though there is no requirement for such coverage to comply with this rule. Therefore, we calculate the cost impact per enrollee should organizations offering plans not subject to this rule choose to comply with this rule with regard to those plans. The rest of the discussion below explores this possibility. QHP issuers on the FFEs : Rebates are required under section 2718(b)(1)(A) of the PHSA CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 435 and the implementing regulations at 45 CFR part 158 when an issuer does not meet the applicable threshold. The commercial market MLR is generally calculated as the percent of each dollar of after-tax premium revenue spent by the issuer on reimbursement for clinica l services, and activities that improve the quality of health care. If the issuer's MLR for a state market is below the applicable threshold, then the issuer must return the difference to policyholders. It follows, that if costs of complying with this rule raise plan costs, and if additionally, the issuers pass on the full cost in the form of premium and/or are able to treat these costs as QIAs, then premiums and rebates will change. The following two highly simplified examples are illustrative. Suppose the MLR threshold is 80 percent (in practice it can vary by state market), but the issuer's MLR is below the threshold at 70 percent. Then, the issuer would have to return the 10 percent as a rebate. If the costs of complying with this rule for an issuer are on average 6 percent of premium and the issuer treats these expenses as QIA, the issuer will now have to rebate only 4 percent instead of 10 percent (that is, the issuer's MLR would be 76 percent rather than 70 percent). Similarly, if both the applicable threshold and issuer MLR are 80 percent, then the issuer would not owe a rebate. There are two effects of recognizing these costs as QIA: (1) for issuers subject to this rule who are below the applicable MLR threshold, the rebate from issuers to policyholders would go down by some amount between $0 and the cost of complying with this rule; and (2) for issuers subject to this rule who are at or above the MLR standards, the premium transfers from enrollees to issuers will go up by some amount between $0 and the cost of complying with this rule. We note that both MLR and rebates are calculated by combining all of an issuer's business (on- and off-Exchange) within a state and market. To estimate these amounts, we used the public use 2016 MLR files on the CMS website CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 436 that were used for Tables 6 through 9 of this RIA. The total reported 2016 premium revenue on the commercial side for individual market plans was approximately $77 billion (See Table 7). Of the $77 billion, the total reported 2016 premium revenue of issuers that were below the commercial MLR standard (80 or 85 percent, depending on the market) was approximately $4 billion. As mentioned earlier, to proceed further we use the estimates of the costs of complying with this rule, which are $84.6 million per year. This cost is for all parent organizations with each parent organization possibly dealing with up to four lines of business subject to MLR requirements and the requirements of this rule: MA (including Part D sponsors); Medicaid; CHIP; and QHP iss uers on the FFEs. Thus, of the $84.6 million level annual cost of complying with this rule, we estimate $18.8 million (22.19 percent commercial proportion * $84.6 million level annual cost complying with this rule) to be the cost for individual market plans. In estimating the transfers to policyholders in individual market plans , we must distinguish between the $4 billion of premium revenues of issuers whose MLR was below the applicable threshold and the $73 billion of premium revenues ($77 billion total revenue for individual market plans - $4 billion) of individual market issuers whose MLR was at or above the applicable threshold. We can now calculate the estimated aggregate transfer in the commercial health insurance market from individual market policyh olders to issuers whether through premium or rebates as follows: Percentage cost of complying with this rule = 0.0244 percent of revenue premium ($18.8 million cost / $77 billion total revenue). Reduced MLR rebates = $1 million (0.0244 percent x $4 billion premium from issuers below th e applicable M LR threshold). CMS -9115-F CPL 03/06/20 437 Increased p remiums = Up to $17.8 million (0.0244 percent x ($77 billion total revenue -$4 billion premium from issuers below the applicable MLR threshold)). Total transfer from enroll ees = Up to $418.8 million ($17.8 million increased premium + $ 1 million reduced rebate). Transfer per enrollee = $1.07 ($418.8 million / 17.5 million commercial health insurance enrollees). We note that the $1.07 (under a dollar per enrollee) is consi stent with the results obtained in Tables 6 through 10 (with exact raw amounts by year without amortization of a large first year expense). These calculations are summarized in Table 15. The $1.07 is the low estimate of first year costs. The high estimate $1.85 per enrollee per year is obtained by replacing the low estimate cost of $272 million with $816 million.

Regulatory Reform Analysis under EO 13771 Executive Order 13771, titled Reducing Regulation and Controlling R egulatory Costs, was issued on January 30, 2017 and requires that the costs associated with significant new regulations \"shall, to the extent permitted by law, be offset by the elimination of existing costs associated with at least two prior regulations.\" This final rule is considered an EO 13771 regulatory action. We estimate that this rule generates $77.8 milli on in annualized costs, discounted at 7 percent relative to year 2016, over an infinite time horizon estimate. Details on the estimated costs of this final rule can be found in the preceding analysis. G. C onclusion The analysis above, together with the preceding preamble, provides an RIA. In accordance with the provisions of Executive Order 12866 , this regulation was reviewed by the O ffice o f Management and Budget.
