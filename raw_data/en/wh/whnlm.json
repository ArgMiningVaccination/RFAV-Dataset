In each case the lesion reported at initial presentation was unremarkable, but became increased in number and diameter secondary to frequent repeated bouts of excessive rubbing. Multiple medical therapies and behavioral modification techniques were utilized to address the wound infection as well as the rubbing behavior, but none proved to be successful long term. Over time, she developed a persistent leukocytosis that seemed unresponsive to therapy. Her age and the chronicity of the condition lead to concerns about the functionality of her immune system and her ability to fight infection. A multifactorial approach was used to address the different components of her condition which included Animal Necessity, LLC. Imuno-2865TM (NatramuneTM), Serenin VetTM, as well as oral and topical Imuno-2865TM is a natural hemicellulose made of arabinoxylan, arabinogalactan, and fatty acid mixture extracted by a proprietary process from a natural blend of gramineae, poaceae, and dioscoreaceae. In human pilot studies, Imuno-2865TM has shown encouraging findings in improving lymphocyte activation and interleukin activity. 1-4 Shana VetTM is a blend of natural phytowaxes and botanical extract with amino acids and vitamins that protect the epidermis, fur, and nails to aid in the prevention of fungal disease. One of the active ingredients is docosanol which inhibits viral replication by interfering with the early intracellular events surrounding viral entry into target cells.5 The supplement also contains Triacontanol (TRIA), one of the ingredients has been known to exhibit anti-inflammatory action in animals and this anti-inflammatory effect of TRIA might be mediated through inhibition of lipid peroxidation.6 Serenin VetTM is a unique blend of natural vitamins and extracts used in marine mammals to help with dominance aggression and submission apprehensiveness.7,8 References 1.
