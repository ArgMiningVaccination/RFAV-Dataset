With this momentum in sales and operating profit growth, we have raised our full -year guidance and are confident in delivering the long -term growth outlooks we set out for shareholders last year. We continue to strengthen our pipeline, notably with very positive high -level results from our late -stage RSV vaccine candidate, together with targeted business development acquisitions of Sierra Oncology and Affinivax. These improvements in R&D and operating performance , together with a strengthened post -demerger balance sheet, create new capacity and flexibility for GSK to invest in growth and innovation for patients and shareholders .\" The Total results are presented in summary on page 2 and under 'Financial performan ce' on pages 9 and 21 and Adjusted results reconciliations are presented on pages 17, 18, 29 and 30. Adjusted results are a non -IFRS measure excluding discontinued operations that may be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, or superior t o, information presented in accordance with IFRS. Adjusted results are defined on page 37 and \u00a3% or AER% growth, CER% growth, free cash flow and other non -IFRS measures are defined on page 68, COVID -19 solutions are also defined on page 68.

The amounts presented for discontinued EPS are for the Consumer Healthcare business. The presentation of continuing and discontinued operat ions under IFRS 5 are set out on page 50. 2022 guidance With the momentum from the business performance to date, GSK now expects 2022 sales to increase between 6 to 8 per cent and Adjusted operating profit to increase b etween 13 to 15 per cent, excluding any contributions from COVID -19 solutions. Adjusted Earni ngs per share is expected to grow around 1 per cent lower than Operating Profit. We have delivered first half performance ahead of our full year guidance, slightly better than expected , informed by strong business delivery and the dynamics of prior year comparators . Predominantly reflecting a more challenging H2 2021 sales comparator as well a s an expected increase in R&D spend , we expect lower reported growth in the second half. Key external factors that will influence the second half of 2022 include the continued risk from COVID -19 dynamics and possible developments in the current uncertain global economic environment . Notwith standing uncertain economic conditions across many markets in which we operate, we observe evidence of healthcare systems recovering and continue to expect full year sales of Specialty Medicines to grow approximately 10% CER and sales of General Medicines to show a slight decrease, primarily reflecting the increased genericisation of established Respiratory medicines. Vaccines sales are now expected to grow at a low to mid-teens percentage at CER for the year. Specifically for Shingrix, we continue to expec t strong double -digit growth and record annual sales in 2022 , based on strong demand in existing markets and continued geographical expansion , however we do expect sales in the second half to be slightly lower than in H1 2022 due to some channel stocking in the first half in the US . From Q2 2022, the Group presents the Haleon plc (Haleon) business as a discontinued operation according to IFRS 5 . Adjusted results excludes profits from discontinued operations. Comparatives ha ve been restated to reflect adjusted results from continuing operations , and guidance is provided on this basis. Dividend policies and expected pay -out ratios are unchanged for GSK , but the dividends per share have been adjusted for the GSK S hare Consolida tion completed on 18 July 2022. The future dividend policies and guidance in relation to the expected dividend pay -out in 2022 for GSK are provided on page 35. 2022 COVID -19 solutions expectations The majority of expected COVID -19 solutions sales for 2022 have been achieved in the first half of this year. Based on known binding agreements with governments, we expect that sales of COVID -19 solutions will be substantially lower in the second half. Compared with 2021, sales will be at a reduced profit contrib ution due to the increased proportion of lower margin Xevudy sales. Given the higher than expected sales achieved in the year to date we now expect this to reduce Adjusted Operating profit growth (including COVID -19 solutions in both years) by between 4% t o 6%. We continue to discuss future opportunities to support governments, healthcare systems, and patients whereby our COVID -19 solutions can address the emergence of any new COVID -19 variant of concern. Press release Q2 Results summary Research and development Quarterly performance YTD performance Total and Adjusted results Financial information Issued: Wednesday, 27 July 2022 , London, U.K . 3 All expectations, guidance and targets regarding future performance and dividend payments should be read together with ' Guidance , assumptions and cautionary statements' on pag e 69. If exchange rates were to hold at the closing rates on 30 June 2022 ($1. 21/\u00a31, \u20ac1.1 6/\u00a31 and Yen 16 5/\u00a31) for the rest of 2022, the estimated positive impact on 2022 Sterling turnover growth for GSK would be 5% and if exchange gains or losses were recognised at the same level as in 2021, the estimated positive impact on 202 2 Sterling Adjusted Operating Profit growth for GSK would be 9%. Demerger of Consumer Healthcare On 18 July 2022, GSK plc separated its Consumer Healthcare business from the GSK Group to form Haleon , an independent listed company. The separation was effected by way of a demerger of 80.1% of GSK's 68% holding in the Consumer Healthcare business to GSK shareholders. Following the demerger, 54.5% of Haleon is held in aggregate by GSK Shareholders, 6.0% is held by GSK (including shares received by GSK's consolidated ESOT trusts) and 7.5% is held by certain Scottish limited partnerships (SLPs) set up to provide a funding mechanism pursuant to which GSK will provide additional funding for GSK's UK Pension Schemes. The aggregate ownership by GSK (including ownership by the ESOT trust s and SLPs) after the demerger of 13.5% will be initially measured at fair value with changes through profit or loss. Pfizer continues to hold 32% of Haleon after the demerger. The gain on demerger distribution will be recognised in Q3 2022. The asset distributed was the 54.5% ownership of the Consumer Healthcare business. The assets distributed were reduced by Consumer Healthcare transactions up to 18 July 2022 that included pre -separation dividends declared and settled after the end of Q2 2022 and before 18 July 2022. Those dividends included: \u00a310.4 billion (\u00a37.1 billion attributable to GSK) of dividends funded by Consumer Healthcare debt that was partially on -lent during Q1 2022 and dividends of \u00a30.6 billion (\u00a30.4 billion attributable to GSK) from available cash balances. GSK's share of the pre-separation dividends funded by debt will result in a reduction of net debt for GSK on demerger (GSK's share of the pr e-separation dividends and loans are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements until demerger). Share consolidation Following completion of the Consumer Healthcare business demerger on 18 July 2022, GSK plc Ordinary shares were consolidated in order to maintain share price comparability before and after demerger on 18 July 2022 . Shareholders of GSK plc received 4 new Ordinary shares for every 5 existing Ordinary shares. Earnings per share, diluted earnings per share, adjusted earnings per shar e and dividends per share have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the Share Consolidation in all the periods presented. Results presentation A conference call and webcast for investors and analysts of the half-year and Q2 2022 results will be hosted by Emma Walmsley, CEO, at 12pm BST on 27 July 2022. Presentation materials will be published on www.gsk.com prior to the webcast and a transcript of the webcast will be published subsequently.

Press release Q2 Results summary Research and development Quarterly performance YTD performance Total and Adjusted results Financial information Issued: Wednesday, 27 July 2022 , London, U.K . 4 The amounts below are from continuing operations unless otherwise specified . Operating performance - Q2 2022 Turnover Medicines 2,704 44 35 Vaccines 1,715 9 3 General Medicines 2,510 5 2 Commer cial Operations 6,929 19 13 Total turnover in the quarter was \u00a36,9 29 million, up 19% at AER, 1 3% at CER, reflecting strong performance in all three product groups. Commercial Operations turnover excluding pandemic sales grew 1 6% at AER, 1 0% at CER. Specialty Medicines Specialty Medicines sales in the quarter were \u00a32,70 4 million, up 44% at AER, 35% at CER, driven by consistent growth in all therapy areas. Specialty Medicines excluding sales of Xevudy were \u00a32,2 38 million up 20% at AER, 13% at CER. In the quarter, HIV sales were \u00a31,404 million with growth up 14% at AER, 7% at CER. Oncology sales in the quarter were \u00a3154 million, up 29% at AER, 23% at CER. Immuno -inflammation, Respiratory and Other sales were \u00a3680 million up 32% at AER, 24% at CER. Vaccines Vaccine sales were \u00a31,71 5 million, up 9% at AER, 3% at CER in total and up 31% at AER, 24% at CER excluding unrepeated 2021 pandemic adjuvant sales. The performance reflected a favourable comparator to Q2 2021, which was impacted by COVID -19 related disruptions in several m arkets, and the strong commercial execution of Shingrix . The growth, however, was partially offset by lower paediatric and adolescent vaccine sales that reflected the normalisation of the US Center for Disease Control (CDC) purchasing patterns . General Medicines General Medicines sales in the quarter were \u00a32,51 0 million, up 5% at AER, 2% at CER, with the impact of generic competition in US, Europe, and Japan offset by Trelegy growth in respiratory and the post-pandemic rebound of the antibiotic market since Q3 2021 in Other General Medicines . General medicines includes \u00a3 33 million (Q2 2021 : \u00a334 million ) of turnover between GSK and Haleon recorded in continuing operations with an offsetting amount recorded in discontinuing operations. Operating profit Total operating profit was \u00a3 1,081 million compared with \u00a3 1,275 million in Q2 2021. The reduction primarily reflected the higher re -measurement charges for contingent consideration liabilities, partly offset by increased profits on turnover growth of 13% at CER and increased milestone income. Adjusted operating profi t was \u00a32,008 million, 22% higher than Q2 2021 at AER and 7% at CER on a turnover increase of 13% at CER. The Adjusted operating margin of 29.0% was 0.9% percentage points higher at AER and 1.5% percentage points lower at CER than in Q2 2021. This primarily reflected higher COVID -19 solutions sales at low margin, which reduced Adjusted Operating profit growth by approximately 16% at AER, 14% at CER and reduced the Adjusted operating margin by approximately 4.5 percentage points at AER and 4.4 percentage poin ts at CER . This was offset by leverage from strong sales growth across all product groups, beneficial mix, and higher royalty income . Earnings per share (adjusted to reflect the Share Consolidation on 1 8 July 2022) Total EPS was 1 7.5p compared with 30.3p in Q2 2021. The reduction primarily reflects increased charges for remeasurement of contingent consideration liabilities as well as an unfavourable comparison due to a credit of \u00a3325 million to Taxation in Q2 2021. Adjusted EPS was 34.7p compared with 28.2p in Q2 2021, up 23% at AER, 6% at CER, on a 7% CER increase in Adjusted operating profit . This primarily reflect ed higher COVID -19 solutions sales at low margin with the reduction to growth from COVID -19 solutions being approximately 20% at AER, 18% at CER . Leverage from growth in sales of Specialty Medicines , beneficial mix, higher royalty income and a lower effective tax rate was partly offset by higher supply chain, f reight and distribution costs and higher non-controlling interests . Cash flow Cash generated from operations attributable to continuing operations for the quarter was \u00a31,5 84 million (Q2 2021: \u00a31,357 million). The increase primarily reflected the increase in operating profit including beneficial exchange and favourable timing of collections partly offset by increased contingent consideration payments, adverse timing of profit share payments for Xevudy sales, a higher seasonal increase in inventory and adverse timing of returns and rebates .

Growth Medicines 5,839 69 63 Vaccines 3,384 21 17 General Medicines 4,896 3 2 Commercial Operations 14,119 28 25 Total turnover in the half year was \u00a314,1 19 million, up 2 8% at AER, 25% at CER, reflecting strong performance in all three product groups. Commercial Operations turnover, excluding pandemic sales, grew 15% at AER, 12% at CER. Specialty Medicines Specialty Medicines sales were \u00a35,8 39 million, up 69% at AER, 6 3% at CER, driven by consistent growth in all therapy areas. Specialty Medicines, excluding sales of Xevudy , were \u00a34,06 6 million up 18% at AER, 14% at CER . HIV sales were \u00a32,585 million with growth of 14% at AER,10% at CER. Oncology sales were \u00a3281 million, up 23% at AER, 19% at CER. Immuno -inflammation, Respiratory and Other sales were \u00a31,20 0 million up 26% at AER, 21% at CER. Vaccines Vaccines turnover was \u00a33,38 4 million, up 21% at AER, 1 7% at CER . Excluding unrepeated 2021 pandemic adjuvant sales, vaccine sales increased 3 3% at AER, 30% at CER , reflecting a favourable comparator to H1 2021, which was adversely impacted by COVID -19 related disruptions in several markets, and the strong commercial execution of Shingrix , particularly in the US and Europe . General Medicines General Medicines sales in the half year were \u00a34,89 6 million, up 3% at AER, 2% at CER, with the impact of generic competi tion in US, Europe and Japan offset by Trelegy growth in respiratory and the post-pandemic rebound of the antibiotic market since H2 2021 in Other General Medicines . General medicines includes \u00a3 76 million (H1 2021: \u00a379 million) of turnover between GSK and Haleon recorded in continuing operations with an offsetting amount recorded in discontinued operations. Operating profit Total operating profit was \u00a33,374 million compared with \u00a32,485 million in H1 2021. This includ ed the \u00a3 0.9 billion upfront income received from the settlement with Gilead Sciences, Inc . (Gilead) and increased profits on turnover growth of 25% at CER, partly offset by higher re -measurement charges for contingent consideration liabilities. Adjusted operating profit was \u00a33,951 million, 33% higher at AER and 26% at CER than H1 2021 on a turnover increase of 25% at CER. The Adjusted operating margin of 28.0% was 1.0 percentage points higher at AER and stable at CER compared to H1 2021. This primarily reflected the impact from low margin COVID -19 solutions sales (Xevudy ), which reduced Adjusted Operati ng profit growth by approximately 2% at AER, 1% at CER and reduced the Adjusted operating margin by approximately 3.3 percentage points at AER and at CER. This was offset by operating leverage from strong sales growth, beneficial mix, and higher royalty in come. Earnings per share (adjusted to reflect the Share Consolidation on 1 8 July 2022 ) Total EPS from continuing operations was 54.8p compared with 50.3p in H1 2021. This primarily reflected the \u00a30.9 billion upfront income received from the settlement with Gilead and increased profits on turnover growth of 25% at CER, partly offset by higher re -measurement charges for contingent consideration liabilities as well as an unfavourable comparison due to a credit of \u00a3325 million to Taxation in Q2 2021. Adjusted EPS was 67.0p compared with 49.3p in H1 2021, up 36% at AER, 27% at CER, on a 26% CER increase in Adjusted operating profit . This included higher COVID -19 solutions sales at low margin with the reduc tion to growth from COVID -19 solutions being approximately 2% at AER, 2% at CER . Leverage from growth in sales of Specialty Medicines, beneficial mix, higher royalty income and a lower effective tax rate was partly offset by higher supply chain, freight and distribution costs , lower associate income and higher non -controlling interests . Cash flow Cash generated from operations attributable to continuing operations for H1 was \u00a33,9 36 million (H1 2021: \u00a31,759 million). The increase primarily reflected a significant increase in operating profit including the upfront income from the settlement with Gilead, favourable exchange and favourable timing of collections and profit share payments for Xevudy sales, partly offset by increased con tingent consideration payments reflecting the Gilead settlement and a higher seasonal increase in inventory .

Commercial Operations turnover, excluding pandemic sales, grew 1 6% at AER, 10% at CER . Specialty Medicines included \u00a3466 million sales of Xevudy , which contributed 24 percentage points of growth in the quarter at AER, 22 percentage points at CER . Vaccines growth reflected strong Shingrix performance assisted by demand recovery and channel inventory build in the US, partially offset by pandemic adjuvant sales in Q2 2021 . General Medicines reflected the recovery of the antibiotics market and in particular the strong performance of Trelegy in respiratory in all regions. Specialty Medicines Specialty Medicines sales in the quarter were \u00a32,70 4 million, up 44% at AER, 35% at CER, driven by consistent growth in all therapy areas. Specialty Medicines excluding sales of Xevudy were \u00a32,2 38 million up 20% at AER, 13% at CER. HIV HIV sales were \u00a31,404 million with growth up 14% at AER, 7% at CER in the quarter. The performance benefitted from strong patient demand for the new HIV favourable US pricing mix, however, t his was partially offset by the unfavourable phasing of Tivicay tenders. US pricing contributed 7% at AER, 4% at CER, with tenders reducing growth by 5% at AER, 6% at CER in the quarter. New HIV medicines delivered for the first -time quarterly sales of ov er half a billion pounds at \u00a3571 million, up 73% at AER, 63% at CER, representing 41% of the total HIV portfolio compared to 27% in the same quarter last year. Sales of the oral two drug regimens Dovato and Juluca were \u00a3320 million and \u00a3152 million, respec tively, with a combined growth of 49% at AER, 41% at CER. Cabenuva , the first long -acting injectable for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) infection , recorded sales of \u00a372 million. Apretude , the first long -acting prevention injec table for the prevention of HIV -1, delivered sales of \u00a38 million. Press release Q2 Results summary Research and development Quarterly performance YTD performance Total and Adjusted results Financial information Issued: Wednesday, 27 July 2022 , London, U.K . 12 Oncology Oncology sales in the quarter were \u00a3154 million, up 29% at AER, 23% at CER. Zejula sales were \u00a3120 million, up 22% at AER, 16% at CER, and Blenrep , sales of \u00a330 million up 43% at AER, 33% at CER; the performance reflected growth in recently launched markets. Immuno -inflammation, Respiratory and Other Immuno -inflammation, Respiratory and Other sales were \u00a368 0 million up 3 2% at AER, 2 4% at CER. Benlysta sales were \u00a3297 million, up 39% at AER, 29% at CER reflecting strong underlying demand in US and worldwide. Nucala sales were \u00a3367 million, up 26% at AER, 19% at CER including US sales of \u00a3236 million up 30% at AER, 18% at CER on continued strong demand and launch of additional indications. Pandemic In the period, s ales of Xevudy were \u00a3466 million , with t he overwhelming majority of sales achieved in Europe \u00a3123 million and International \u00a3320 million . In the US, the government cont ract was completed in Q1 2022. Vaccines Vaccine sales were \u00a31,71 5 million, up 9% at AER, 3% at CER in total and up 31% at AER, 24% at CER excluding unrepeated 2021 pandemic adjuvant sales. The performance reflected a favourable comparator to Q2 2021, which was adversely impacted by COVID -19 related disruptions in several markets, and the strong commercial execution of Shingrix , particularly in the US and Europe . The growth, however, was partially offset by lower paediatric and adolescent vaccine sales that reflected the normalisation of the US CDC purchasing patterns . Shingles Shingrix sales more than doubled to \u00a3731 million primarily due t o demand recovery, strong commercial execution aimed at shifting the shingles vaccination season forward, and earlier -than- expected channel inventory build in the US, and higher demand in Germany. All regions grew significantly in Q2 2022, with 40% of th e growth contributed from outside of the US. Shingrix is now available in 23 countries including four new launches in the last quarter . Established Vaccines Established Vaccines dec reased 5% at AER, 9% at CER to \u00a371 7 million reflecting unfavourable CDC purchasing patterns and competitive pressure for Infanrix /Pediarix in the US, lower International sales of Cervarix, MMR/V vaccines and Synflorix , and the negative impact of a CDC stockpile borrow for Rotarix, partially offset by hepatitis vaccines growth in the US and Europe. General Medicines General Medicines sales in the quarter were \u00a32,5 10 million, up 5% at AER, 2% at CER, with the adverse impact of generic competition in US, Europe, and Japan offset by Trelegy growth in respiratory and the post-pandemic rebound of the antibiotic market since Q3 2021 in Other General Medicines . Respiratory Respiratory sales were \u00a31,649 million, up 9% at AER, 4% at CER. The performance was driven by Trelegy sales of \u00a3467 million, up 6 0% at AER, 50% at CER with strong growth in all regions and some benefit of prior period Returns and Rebates (RAR) adjustments in the US. Advair/Seretide sales of \u00a3262 million c ontinue to be adversely impacted by generic competition, decreasing 2 4% at AER, 27% at CER. Overall, there was no significant impact of prior period RAR adjustments in the quarter. Other General Medicines Other General Medicines sales were \u00a38 61 million, down 1% at AER, 2% at CER. Augmentin sales were \u00a3130 million, up 4 3% at AER, 4 5% at CER reflecting the post-pandemic rebound of the antibiotic since Q3 2021. This offsets the ongoing adverse impact of generic competition and approximately two p ercentage points impact from the divestment of cephalosporin products in Q4 2021. General medicines includes \u00a3 33 million (Q2 2021: \u00a3 34 million) of turnover between GSK and Haleon recorded in continuing operations with an offsetting amount recorded in discontinuing operations.

There were \u00a323 million sales of Xevudy in the quarter following completion of the government contract in Q1 2022. In Specialty Medicines, HIV sales of \u00a3894 million were up 25% at AER, 13% at CER. New HIV medicines delivered sales of \u00a3377 million up 75% at AER, 59% at CER driven by strong pricing mix. Nucala and Benlysta both continued to grow double digits reflecting ongoing strong demand. Oncology sales increased 22% at AER, 10% at CER , despite diagnosis and treatment rates continuing to be adversely impacted by the pandemic. Vaccine sales were \u00a3897 million, up 13% at AER, 2% at CER. Vaccine sales excluding the impact of COVID -19 vaccine adjuvant sales in Q2 2021 grew 53% at AER, 38% at CER. Growth was driven by Shingrix reflecting demand recovery, strong commercial execution , and channel inventory build. Growth was r educed by lower paediatric and adolescent vaccines sales reflecting the normalisation of CDC purchasing patterns. General Medicines sales were \u00a3933 million , up 11% at AER, stable at CER, driven by strong Trelegy performance, up 74% at AER, 58% at CER on g rowth of the single inhaler triple therapy market and demand. Europe In Europe, sales were \u00a31,549 million, up 23% at AER, 25% at CER, including Xevudy sales of \u00a3123 million contributing ten percentage points of growth at AER and CER . In Specialty Medicines, HIV sales were \u00a3336 million , up 15% at AER, 17% at CER. The performance predomina ntly reflected strong patient demand for Dovato with sales of \u00a3118 million during the period. Benlysta in immunology , Nucala in respiratory, and several Oncology medicines also delivered strong double -digit growth in the quarter. Vaccine sales were \u00a3414 million, up 39% at AER, 42% at CER. Shingrix sales of \u00a3151 million, >100% at AER and CER, drove the growth particularly in Ge rmany, which benefitted from strong demand. General Medicines sales were \u00a3522 million , decreasing 3% at AER, 2% at CER, with ongoing generic competitive pressures adversely impacting Seretide in respiratory; the performance was partly offset by strong demand for Trelegy . Augmentin grew due to the post-pandemic rebound of the antibiotic market since Q3 2021 . International International sales were \u00a32, 063 million, up 1 5% at AER, 1 4% at CER, including Xevudy sales of \u00a3320 million contributing 1 5 percentage points of growth. In Specialty Medicines, HIV sales were \u00a3174 million , decreasing 23% at AER, 27% at CER driven by tender phasing . The performance , however , was partially offset by strong Dovato growth. Co mbined Tivicay and Triumeq sales were \u00a3130 million, declining 35% at AER, 40% at CER. Nucala in respiratory and Benlysta in immunology both continued to grow strongly reflecting growth in the biologic s market in Japan and inclusion on China's National Rei mbursement Drug List. Vaccine sales were \u00a340 4 million, decreasing 15% at AER, 18% at CER. Vaccine sales excluding the impact of COVID -19 vaccine adjuvant sales in Q2 2021 decreased 6% at AER, 8% at CER, primarily reflecting phasing of public tenders. General Medicines sales were \u00a31,0 55 million up 6% at AER, 5% at CER. Respiratory sales of \u00a3455 million were up 8% at AER, 7% at CER reflecting strong growth of Trelegy , particularly in Japan, China, and Canada. This performance offset the impact of generic competition and lower allergy season in Japan. Other General Medicines sales increased 4% at AER and at CER to \u00a36 00 million, reflecting the g rowth of Augmentin following the post -pandemic rebound of the antibiotic market since Q3 2022. Press release Q2 Results summary Research and development Quarterly performance YTD performance Total and Adjusted results Financial information Issued: Wednesday, 27 July 2022 , London, U.K . 14 Operating perfor mance Cost of sales Total cost of sales as a percentage of turnover was 31.4%, and increased 2.1 percentage points higher at AER and 4.0 percentage points higher in CER terms than Q2 2021. Adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of turnover was 28.4%, up 2.4 percentage points AER and 4.1 at CER compared with Q2 2021. This primarily reflected higher sales of lower margin COVID -19 solutions (Xevudy ) compared to Q2 2021 , which included \u00a3258 million of pandemic adjuvant sales, increasing cost of sales margin by 4.7 percentage points at AER and at CER as well as the impact of increased commodity prices and freight costs. This was partially offset by a favourable mix primarily from increased sales of Shingrix in the US and Europe and increased sales of HIV medicines in the US. Selling, general and administration Total SG&A costs as a percentage of turnover were 29.8%, 0.9 percentage points higher a t AER and 1.7 percentage points higher at CER than in Q2 2021 primarily reflect ed increased investment in the launch of innovati ve vaccines and medicines . Adjusted SG&A costs as a percentage of turnover were 28.2%, stable at AER, 0.7 percentage points h igher at CER. Adjusted SG&A costs increased 19% at AER, 16% at CER which primarily reflected an increased level of launch investment in Specialty Medicines particularly HIV and Vaccines including Shingrix to drive post-pandemic recovery demand and support market expansion. The growth in Adjusted SG&A also reflected increased freight and distribution costs and exchange losses on the Vir Biotechnology, Inc. collaboration profit share. This growth was partly offset by the continuing benefit of restructuring and tight control of ongoing costs. Research and development Group R&D expenditure from continuing operatio ns was \u00a31,242 million (17.9% of turnover), up 6% at AER and 2% at CER. Adjusted R&D expenditure increased in the quarter by 4% at AER, broadly stable at CER, to \u00a31,155 million. This reflected the continued efficiencies delivered from the One R&D restructur ing programme, the completion of several late -stage clinical development programmes, and a favourable comparator to Q2 2021, which saw increased levels of R&D investment due to COVID -19 pandemic solutions. In the quarter, GSK increased investment across Vaccine clinical development, including its mRNA technology platforms, continued investment in the late -stage portfolio, and accelerated several early discovery programmes; these investments partly offset the decreases above. In addition, the level of inv estment increased in Specialty Medicines to support the early -stage HIV portfolio and in respiratory, the phase III programme for depemokimab, a potential new medicine to treat severe asthma. The expenditure in the quarter does not reflect the impact of th e acquisition of Sierra Oncology, Inc. which completed on 1 July 2022 . Royalty income Royalty income was \u00a3159 million (Q2 2021: \u00a377 million), up >100% at AER, >100% at CER, primarily reflecting royalty income from Gilead under the settlement and licensing agreement with Gilead and higher sales of Gardasil. Other operating income/(expense) Net other operating expense was \u00a3523 million (Q2 2021: \u00a37 6 million) primarily reflecting accounting charges of \u00a3699 million (Q2 2021: \u00a3 101 million) arising from the re -measurement of contingent consideration liabilities and the liabilities for the Pfizer , Inc. (Pfizer) put option and Pfizer and Shionogi & Co., Ltd. (Shionogi) preferential dividends in ViiV Healthcare. This included a re -measurement charge of \u00a3 585 million (Q2 2021: \u00a3 125 million) for the contingent consideration liability due to Shionogi, including the unwinding of the discount for \u00a3 95 million and a charge for \u00a3 490 million primarily from changes to exchange rates as well as adjustments to sales forecasts. This was partly offset by increased milestone income. Operating profit Total operating profit was \u00a3 1,081 million compared with \u00a3 1,275 million in Q2 2021. The reduction primarily reflected the higher re -measurement charges for contingent considerati on liabilities, partly offset by increased profits on turnover growth of 13% at CER and increased milestone income. Adjusted operating profit was \u00a32,008 million, 22% higher than Q2 2021 at AER and 7% at CER on a turnover increase of 13% at CER. The Adjust ed operating margin of 29.0% was 0.9% percentage points higher at AER and 1.5% percentage points lower at CER than in Q2 2021. This primarily reflected the impact from low margin COVID -19 solutions sales (Xevudy), which reduced Adjusted Operating profit gr owth by approximately 16% at AER, 14% at CER and reduced the Adjusted operating margin by approximately 4.5 percentage points at AER and 4.4 percentage points at CER. This was offset by operating leverage from sales growth across all product groups, beneficial mix, and higher royalty income. Press release Q2 Results summary Research and development Quarterly performance YTD performance Total and Adjusted results Financial information Issued: Wednesday, 27 July 2022 , London, U.K . 15 Contingent consideration cash payments made to Shionogi and other companies reduce the balance sheet liability and hence are not recorded in the income statement. Total contingent consideration cash payments in Q2 2022 amounted to \u00a3404 million (Q2 2021: \u00a3 205 million ). These included to Shionogi of \u00a3395 million (Q2 2021: \u00a3 203 million). Adjusted operating profit by business Commercial Operations operating profit was \u00a33,304 million, up 15% at AER and 6% at CER on a turnover increase of 13% at CER. Th e operating margin of 47.7% was 1.5 percentage points lower at AER and 3.2 percentage points lower at CER than in Q2 2021. This primarily reflected sales of lower margin Xevudy in the quarter compared to Q2 2021 which included higher margin pandemic adjuv ant sales. This also reflected increased investment behind launches in Specialty Medicines including HIV and Vaccines plus higher commodity, freight and distribution costs. This was partly offset by continued tight control of ongoing costs, benefits from c ontinued restructuring and increased royalty income from Biktarvy sales following the settlement with Gilead in February 2022 and Gardasil sales. R&D segment operating expenses were \u00a31,152 million, up 3% at AER, down 2% at CER, primarily reflecting contin ued efficiencies delivered from the One R&D restructuring programme, the completion of several late-stage clinical development programmes, and a favourable comparator to Q2 2021, which saw increased levels of R&D investment due to COVID -19 pandemic soluti ons. This was partly offset by increased investment in Vaccines including priority investments for mRNA and late stage portfolio and Specialty in early stage HIV and depemokimab. Net finance costs Total net finance costs were \u00a3183 million compared with \u00a3 185 million in Q2 2021. Adjusted n et finance costs were \u00a3 181 million compared with \u00a3 185 million in Q2 2021. Taxation The charge of \u00a3 150 million represented an effective tax rate on Total results of 16.7% (Q2 2021: 18.8% credit) and reflect ed the different tax effects of the various Adjusting items . Included in Q2 2021 was a credit of \u00a3325 million resulting from the revaluation of deferred tax assets following enactment of the proposed change of UK corporation tax from 19% to 25%. Tax on A djusted profit amounted to \u00a3 277 million and represented an effective Adjusted tax rate of 15.2% (Q2 2021: 16.6%). Issues related to taxation are described in Note 14, 'Taxation' in the Annual Report 2021. The Group continues to believe it has made adequat e provision for the liabilities likely to arise from periods that are open and not yet agreed by relevant tax authorities. The ultimate liability for such matters may vary from the amounts provided and is dependent upon the outcome of agreements with relev ant tax authorities. Non-controlling interests The allocation of Total earnings to non -controlling interests amounted to \u00a340 million (Q2 2021: \u00a357 million). The decrease was primarily due to an reduced allocation of ViiV Healthcare profits of \u00a3 41 million (Q2 2021: \u00a360 million) including increased credits for re -measurement of contingent consideration liabilities. The allocation of Adjusted earnings to non -controlling interests amounted to \u00a3 150 million (Q2 2021: \u00a399 million). The increase in allocation primarily reflected an increased allocation of ViiV Healthcare profits of \u00a3151 million (Q2 2021: \u00a3 102 million). Earnings per share from continuing operations Total EPS was 17.5p compared with 30.3p in Q2 2021. The reduction pr imarily reflect ed increased charges for remeasurement of contingent consideration liabilities as well as an unfavourable comparison due to a credit of \u00a3325 million to Taxation in Q2 2021 resulting from the revaluation of deferred tax assets. Adjusted EPS was 34.7p compared with 28.2p in Q2 2021, up 23% at AER, 6% at CER, on a 7% CER increase in Adjusted operating profit primarily reflecting higher COVID -19 solutions sales at low margin, with the reduction to growth from COVID -19 solutions being approximat ely 20% at AER, 18% at CER. Operating leverage from growth in sales of Specialty Medicines including HIV and Vaccines, beneficial mix, higher royalty income and a lower effective tax rate was partly offset by higher supply chain, freight and distribution costs and higher non -controlling interes ts. Press release Q2 Results summary Research and development Quarterly performance YTD performance Total and Adjusted results Financial information Issued: Wednesday, 27 July 2022 , London, U.K . 16 Profit and earnings per share from discontinued operations Discontinued operations include the Consumer Healthcare business and certain Corporate costs directly attributable to the Consumer Healthcare. Profit after taxation from discontinued opera tions amounted to \u00a3229 million (Q2 2021: \u00a3 267 million) and EPS from discontinu ed was 3.3p, compared with 4.5p in Q2 2021 . The reduction in profit and EPS primarily reflected increased separation costs and increased interest costs. For further d etails see page 52, discontinued operations. Total earnings per share Total EPS was 20.8p compared with 34.8p in Q2 2021. The reduction primarily reflects increase d charges for remeasurement of contingent consideration liabilities as well as an unfavourable comparison due to a credit of \u00a3325 million to Taxation in Q2 2021 resulting from the revaluation of deferred tax assets. Currency impact on Q2 2022 results The r esults for Q2 2022 are based on average exchange rates, principally \u00a31/$ 1.26, \u00a31/\u20ac1.18 and \u00a31/Yen 162. Comparative exchange rates are given on page 50. The period -end exchange rates were \u00a31/$ 1.21, \u00a31/\u20ac1.16 and \u00a31/Yen 165. In Q2 2022, turnover was up 19% a t AER and 13% at CER. Total EPS from continuing operations was 17.5p compared with 30.3p in Q2 2021. Adjusted EPS compared with in Q2 2021, up 23% at AER and 6% at CER . The favourable currency impact primarily reflected the weakening of Sterling against the US Dollar, partly offset by the strengthening in Sterling against the Euro and Japanese Yen.

The non-cash charges of \u00a3 105 million primarily reflected the write -down of assets in administrative locations and impairment of IT assets. Total cash payments made in Q2 2022 were \u00a3 78 million 70 million (Q2 2021: \u00a3113 million) relating to the Separation Preparation restructuring programme and \u00a3 8 million (Q2 2021: \u00a333 million) relating to other legacy programmes including the settlement of certain charges accrued in previous quarters. The analysis of Major restructuring charges by Income statement line was as follows: Q2 2022 \u00a3m Q2 2021 \u00a3m Cost of sales 21 18 Selling, general and administration 106 55 Research and development 7 29 Total major restructuring costs from continuing operations 134 102 Materially all of the Separation Preparation restructuring programme has been included as part of continuing operations. The legacy Consumer Healthcare Joint Venture integration programme is now included as part of discontinued operations. Transaction -related adjustments Transaction -related adjustments resulted in a net charge of \u00a3 685 million (Q2 2021: \u00a3 130 million). This included a net \u00a3 699 million accounting charge for the re -measurement of contingent consideration liabilities and the liabilities for t he Pfizer put option and Pfizer and Shionogi preferential dividends -ViiV Healthcare joint Venture (including Shionogi preferential dividends) 585 125 ViiV Healthcare put options and Pfizer preferential dividends 118 (37) Contingent consideration on former Novartis Vaccines business (4) 13 Other adjustments (14) 29 Total transaction -related charges 685 130 Press release Q2 Results summary Research and development Quarterly performance YTD performance Total and Adjusted results Financial information Issued: Wednesday, 27 July 2022 , London, U.K . 20 The \u00a3585 million charge relating to the contingent consideration for the former Shionogi -ViiV Healthcare joint venture represented an increase in the valuation of the contingent consideration due to Shionogi, as a result of the unwind of the discount for \u00a395 million and a charge of \u00a3490 million primarily from exchange rates as well as adjustments to sales forecasts. The \u00a3118 million charge relating to the ViiV Healthcare put option and Pfizer preferential dividends represented an increase in the valuation of the put option primarily as a result of updated exchange rates and adjustments to sales forecasts. The ViiV Healthcare contingent consideration liability is fair valued under IFRS. An explanation of the accounting for the non -controlling interests in V iiV Healthcare is set out on page 38. Divestments, significant legal charges , and other items Divestments, significant legal charges and other items primarily include milestone income gains and certain other Adjusting items. Discontinued operations GSK satisfied the criteria in IFRS 5 for treating Consumer Healthcare as a ' discontinued operation' effective from 30 June 2022, as it was expected that the carrying amount of the disposal group will be recovered principally through disposal and a distribution, it was available for distribution in its present condition (subject only to the steps to be completed that are usual and customary f or the demerger of a business) and it was considered highly probable (the date of the demerger being 18 July 2022). From Q2 2020, the Group started to report additional costs to prepare for establishment of the Consumer Healthcare business as an independe nt entity (\"Separation costs\") and these have been presented as part of discontinued operations. Total separation costs incurred in Q2 2022 were \u00a3 163 million (Q2 2021: \u00a37 4 million). This includes \u00a3 30 million relating to transaction costs incurred in connec tion with the demerger and preparatory admission costs related to the listing of Haleon.

Commercial Operations turnover , excluding pandemic sales , grew 15% at AER, 12% at CER. Specialty Medicines included \u00a31,773 million sales of Xevudy , which contributed 13 percentage points of growth at AER and CER . Vaccines growth reflected strong Shingrix performance assisted by demand recovery and channel inventory build in the US, partially offset by pandemic adjuvant sales in H1 2021 . General Medicines reflected the post-pandemic recovery of the antibiotics market and the strong performance of Trelegy in respiratory across all regions. Specialty Medicines Specialty Medicines sales were \u00a3 5,839 million, up 69% at AER, 63% at CER, driven by consistent growth in all therapy areas. Specialty Medicines excluding sales of Xevudy , were \u00a34,06 6 million , up 18% at AER, 14% at CER. HIV HIV sales were \u00a32,585 million with growth of 14% at AER,10% at CER. The performance benefited from strong patient demand for the new HIV medicines (Dovato, Cabenuva, Juluca, Rukobia , and Apretude phasing was broadly offset by favourable US channel inventory movements. New HIV medicines delivered for the first -time half year sales of over one billion pounds to \u00a31,017 million , up 72% at AER, 66% at CER, representing 39% of the t otal HIV portfolio compared to 26% in H1 2021. Sales of the oral two drug regimens Dovato and Juluca were \u00a3577 million and \u00a3285 million , respectively , with combined growth of 51% at AER, 47% at CER. Cabenuva , the first long -acting injectable for the treatm ent of HIV-1 infection , recorded sales of \u00a3110 million. Apretude , the first long -acting injectable for the prevention of HIV -1 delivered sales of \u00a310 million.

Zejula sales of \u00a3218 million were up 17% at AER, 14% at CER with diagnosis and treatment rates continuing to be impacted by the pandemic especially in the US. Sales of Blenrep of \u00a355 million increased 31% at AER, 26% at CER , reflecting ongoing launches and grow th in launched markets. Immuno -inflammation, Respiratory and Other Immuno -inflammation, Respiratory and Other sales were \u00a31,20 0 million up 26% at AER, 21% at CER. Benlysta sales were \u00a3512 million, up 31% at AER, 24% at CER , representing strong underlying demand worldwide. Nucala sales were \u00a3662 million, up 21% at AER, 18% at CER , including US sales of \u00a3413 million up 24% at AER, 16% at CER . The performance reflected continued strong patient demand and the launch of several additional indications. Pandemic Sales of Xevudy were \u00a3 1,773 million, compared to \u00a316 million sales in the first half of last year. Sales were delivered in all regions ; \u00a3793 million in the US , \u00a3434 million in Europe , and \u00a3546 million in International. Vaccines Vaccines turnover was \u00a33,38 4 million, up 21% at AER, 1 7% at CER . Excluding unrepeated 2021 pandemic adjuvant sales , vaccine sales increased 33% at AER, 30% at CER . The performance reflected a favourable comparator to H1 2021 , which was impacted by COVID -19 related disruptions in several markets , and the strong commercial execution of Shingrix , particularly in the US and Europe . Meningitis Meningitis vaccines sales grew 8% at AER, 6% at CER t o \u00a3447 million mainly driven by Bexsero (10% at AER, 9% at CER to \u00a3328 million) resulting from higher CDC purchasing and increased share in the US, partially offset by phasing of tenders in Europe. Shingles Shingrix sales more than doubled to \u00a31,429 million primarily due to demand recovery, strong commercial execution aimed at shifting the shingles vaccination season forward and earlier -than-expected channel inventory build in the US, and higher demand in Germany. All regions grew significantly in H1 2022, with 41% of the growth contributed from outside of the US. Shingrix is now available in 23 countries. Established Vaccines Established Vaccines grew 1% AER but decreased 1% at CER to \u00a31,45 8 million mainly as a res ult of lower International tender demand and unfavourable phasing for Synflorix , lower sales for Cervarix , and MMR/V vaccines in International, and the negative impact of a CDC stockpile borrow for Rotarix . This decrease was partially offset by higher dema nd for hepatitis vaccines and Boostrix in the US and Europe. General Medicines General Medicines sales in the half year were \u00a3 4,896 million, up 3% at AER, 2% at CER, with the impact of generic competition in US, Europe and Japan offset by Trelegy growth in respiratory and the post-pandemic rebound of the antibiotic market since H2 2021, in Other General Medicines . Respiratory Respiratory sales were \u00a33,184 million, up 6% at AER, 3% at CER. The performance was driven by Trelegy sales of \u00a3807 million, up 50% AER, 43% CER , including strong growth across all regions . The performance also benefit ted from prior period RAR adjustments in the US. Advair/Seretide sales of \u00a3564 million decreased 19% at AER, 20% at CER predominately reflecting the adverse impact of generic competition ; growth in certain International markets due to targeted promotion offset the decrease . Other General Medicines Other General Medicines sales were \u00a31,7 12 million, and decreas ed 1% at AER, stable at CER. Augmentin sales were \u00a325 9 million, up 4 2% at AER, 4 8% at CER , reflecting the post pandemic rebound of the antibiotic market since Q3 2021 in the In ternational and Europe regions. This offsets the ongoing adverse impact of generic competition and approximately two percentage points impact from the divestment of cephalosporin products in Q4 2021. Press release Q2 Results summary Research and development Quarterly performance YTD performance Total and Adjusted results Financial information Issued: Wednesday, 27 July 2022 , London, U.K . 25 By Region US In the US, sales were \u00a36,903 million, up 38% at AER, 29% at CER, including Xevudy sales of \u00a3793 million contributing ten percentage points of growth. In Specialty Medicines, HIV sales were \u00a31,591 million up 21% at AER, 13% at CER driven by strong patient demand from all new HIV products with sales of \u00a3662 million up 73% at AER, 62% at CER , and favourable channel inventory movements. HIV medicines, Dovato delivered sales of \u00a3309 million and Cabenuva \u00a395 million. Nucala in respiratory and Benlysta in immuno logy both continued to grow double -digit and reflect ed ongoing and strong patient demand. Oncology sales increased 14% at AER, 7% at CER with diagnosis and treatment rates continuing to be impacted by the pandemic. Vaccine sales were \u00a31,789 million, up 38% at AER, 29% at CER . Excluding the impact of COVID -19 vaccine adjuvant sales during the first half of 2021, sales increased 64% at AER, 5 3% at CER. The performance was primarily driven by Shingrix and reflect ed demand recovery and the benefit of a favourable comparator in the first half of 2021 when sales were impacted by COVID -19 related , Hepatitis , Infanrix /Pediarix , and Boostrix sales all g rew reflecting CDC purchasing patterns and demand recovery. General Medicines sales were \u00a31,7 44 million up 9% at AER, 2% at CER, driven by strong respiratory sales of Trelegy , which increased 57% at AER, 47% at CER , and reflected increased patient demand and growth of the single inhaler triple therapy market. Europe In Europe, sales were \u00a33,209 million, up 2 7% at AER, 30% at CER, including Xevudy sales of \u00a3434 million contributing 17 percentage points of growth. In Specialty Medicines, HIV sales were \u00a3635 million up 10% at AER, 13% at CER primarily driven by strong patient demand from two drug regimens Dovato and Juluca. Dovato delivered sales \u00a363 Benlysta in immunology, Nucala in respiratory, and several Oncology medicines continued to show strong double -digit growth. Vaccine sales were \u00a3823 million, up 36% at AER, 40% at CER. The performance was driven by Shingrix sales of \u00a3311 million, >100% at AER, >100% at CER , particularly in Germany. General Medici nes sales were \u00a31,025 million and decreas ed 5% at AER, 3% at CER, reflecting the ongoing and adverse impact of generic competitive pressures on Seretide . This was partly offset , however, by strong demand for Trelegy in respiratory and the growth of Augmentin following the post-pandemic rebound of the antibiotic market since H2 2021 . International International sales were \u00a34,0 07 million, up 1 6% at AER, 1 7% at CER, including Xevudy sales of \u00a3546 million contributing 14 percentage points of g rowth. In Specialty Medicines, HIV sales were \u00a3359 million and decreased 4% at AER, 5% at CER , primarily driven by tender phasing ; strong Dovato growth partially offset the performance . Combined Tivicay and Triumeq sales were \u00a3278 million decreasing 14% at AER, 15% at CER. Nucala in respiratory and Benlysta in immunology both continued to grow strongly reflecting biologic market growth in Japan and addition to China's National Reimbursement Drug List. Vaccine sales were \u00a377 2 million and decreas ed 13% at AER, 14% at CER. Vaccine sales excluding the impact of COVID -19 vaccine adjuvant sales in H1 2021 decreased 8% at AER, 9% at CER, primarily reflecting the phasing of public tenders and the lower sales of divested brands. General Medicines sales were \u00a32 ,127 million up 4% at AER, 5% at CER. Respiratory sales of \u00a3935 million increased 4% at AER, 5% at CER reflecting strong growth of Trelegy , particularly in Japan, China , and Canada . This performance, however, was offset by the adverse impact of generic com petition and a lower allergy season in Japan. Other General Medicines sales of \u00a31,1 92 million increased 4% at AER, 5% at CER, and reflect ed growth of Augmentin following the post-pandemic rebound of the antibiotic market since H2 2021. Press release Q2 Results summary Research and development Quarterly performance YTD performance Total and Adjusted results Financial information Issued: Wednesday, 27 July 2022 , London, U.K . 26 Operating performance Cost of sales Total cost of sales as a percentage of turnover was 34.7%, 4.1 percentage points higher at AER and 4.9 percentage points higher in CER terms than H1 2021. This included lower write -downs on sites from major restructuring programmes compared to 2021. Excluding these and other Adjusting items, Adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of turnover was 31.9%, 5.0 percentage points higher at AER and 5.7 percentage points higher at CER compared with H1 2021. This primarily reflected higher sales of lower margin Xevudy compared to H1 2021 which included higher margin pandemic adjuvant sales, increasing cost of sales margin by 7.7 percentage points at AER and 7.6 percentage points at CER , as well as the impact of increased commodity prices and freight costs. This was partially offset by a favourable mix primarily from i ncreased sales of Shingrix in the US and Europe and increased sales of HIV medicines in the US. Selling, general and administration Total SG&A costs as a percentage of turnover were 27.5%, 1.6 percentage points lower at AER and 1.4 percentage points low er at CER than in H1 2021 as the growth in sales outweighed SG&A expenditure growth. Adjusted SG&A costs as a percentage of turnover were 26.4%, 1.9 percentage points lower at AER than in H1 2021 and 1. 6 percentage points lower at CER. Adjusted SG&A cos ts increased 20% at AER, 18% at CER which primarily reflected an increased level of launch investment in Specialty Medicines particularly HIV and Vaccines including Shingrix to drive post -pandemic recovery demand and support market expansion. The growth in Adjusted SG&A also reflected an unfavourable comparison to a beneficial legal settlement in 2021, exchange losses on the Vir Biotechnology, Inc. collaboration profit share and impairment provisions relating to Ukraine. This growth, however was partly offs et by the continuing benefit of restructuring and tight control of ongoing costs. Research and development Group R&D expenditure was \u00a32,345 million (16.6% of turnover), up 5% at AER and 3% at CER. Adjusted R&D expenditure in the year -to-date was \u00a32,243 million, up 5% at AER, 3% at CER. This reflected continued efficiencies driven by the One R&D restructuring programme, the completion of several late -stage clinical development programmes, and a favou rable comparator to H1 2021, which saw increased levels of R&D investment due to COVID -19 pandemic solutions. In the half year, GSK increased investment across Vaccine clinical development, including investments into its emerging mRNA technology platform , continued investment in the late -stage portfolio and accelerated several early discovery programmes. In addition, in Specialty Medicines, the level of R&D investment increased to support the early -stage HIV portfolio and in respiratory, the phase III pro gramme for depemokimab, a potential new medicine to treat severe asthma. The expenditure in the year to date does not reflect the impact of the acquisition of Sierra Oncology, Inc. which completed on 1 July 2022 . Royalty income Royalty income was \u00a3297 mil lion (H1 2021: \u00a3166 million), up 79% at AER, 77% at CER, primarily reflecting royalty income from Gilead under the settlement and licensing agreement with Gilead announced on 1 February 2022 and higher sales of Gardasil . Other operating income/(expense) Net other operating income was \u00a3 74 million (H1 2021: \u00a31 13 million) including \u00a3 0.9 billion upfront income received from the settlement with Gilead, partly offset by accounting charges of \u00a31,03 1 million (H1 2021: \u00a3208 million) arising from the re -measurement of contingent consideration liabilities and the liabilities for the Pfizer put option and Pfizer and Shionogi preferential dividends in ViiV Healthcare. This included a re-measurement charge of \u00a3 841 million (H1 2021: \u00a3 259 million) for t he contingent consideration liability due to Shionogi, including the unwinding of the discount for \u00a3 196 million and a charge for \u00a3 645 million primarily from changes to exchange rates as well as adjustments to sales forecasts. Press release Q2 Results summary Research and development Quarterly performance YTD performance Total and Adjusted results Financial information Issued: Wednesday, 27 July 2022 , London, U.K . 27 Operating profit Total operating profit was \u00a3 3,374 million compared with \u00a3 2,485 million in H1 2021. This included the \u00a30.9 billion upfront income received from the settlement with Gilead and increased profits on turnover growth of 25% at CER, partly offset by higher re -measurement charges for contingent consideration liabilities. Adjusted operating profit was \u00a33,951 million, 33% higher at AER and 26% at CER than H1 2021 on a turnover increase of 25% at CER. The Adjusted operating margin of 28.0% was 1.0 percentage points higher at AER and stable at CER compared to H1 2021. This primarily reflected the impact from low margin COVID -19 solutions sales (Xevudy), which reduced Adjusted Operating profit growth by approximately 2% at AER, 1% at CER and reduced the Adjusted opera ting margin by approximately 3.3 percen tage points at AER and CER. This was offset by operating leverage from strong sales growth , mix benefit and higher royalty income. Contingent consideration cash payments made to Shionogi and other companies reduce t he balance sheet liability and hence are not recorded in the income statement. Total contingent consideration cash payments in H1 2022 amounted to \u00a3 615 million (H1 2021: \u00a34 26 million). These included cash payments made to Shionogi of \u00a3603 million (H1 2021: \u00a3419 million). Adjusted operating profit by business Commercial Operations operating profit was \u00a3 6,421 million, up 21% at AER and 16% at CER on a turnover increase of 25% at CER. The operating margin of 45.5% was 2.8 percentage points lower at AER, 3.5 percentage points lower at CER than in H1 2021. This primarily reflected strong sales of lower margin Xevudy in the period, increased investment behind launches in Specialty Medicines including HIV and Vaccines plus hig her commodity, freight and distribution costs as well as an adverse comparison to a favourable legal settlement in H1 2021. This was partly offset by continued tight control of ongoing costs, benefits from continued restructuring and increased royalty inco me from Biktarvy sales following the settlement with Gilead in February 2022 and Gardasil sales. R&D segment operating expenses were \u00a32,247 million, up 5% at AER, 2% at CER, primarily reflecting increased investment in Vaccines including priority investme nts for mRNA and late stage portfolio and Specialty in early stage HIV and depemokimab. This was partly offset by continued efficiencies driven by the R&D restructuring programme, the completion of several late -stage clinical development programmes, and a favourable comparator to H1 2021, which saw increased levels of R&D investment due to COVID -19 pandemic solutions. Net finance costs Total net finance costs were \u00a3 381 million compared with \u00a337 7 million in H1 2021. Adjusted n et finance costs were \u00a3 379 million compared with \u00a3 375 million in H1 2021. Share of after tax profits of associates and joint ventures The share of after tax loss of associates and joint ventures was \u00a3 3 million (H1 2021: \u00a3 32 million share of profit ). In H1 2021, the Group also reported a net loss on disposal of interests in associates of \u00a336 million, primarily driven by a loss o n disposal of our interest in the associate Innoviva Inc. Taxation The charge of \u00a3 473 million represented an effective tax rate on Total results of 15.8% (H1 2021: 2.2% credit) and reflected the different tax effects of the various Adjusting items . Included in H1 2021 is a credit of \u00a3325 million resulting from the revaluation of deferred tax assets following enactment of the proposed change of UK corporatio n tax rates from 19% to 25%. Tax on Adjusted profit amounted to \u00a3 564 million and represented an effective Adjusted tax rate of 15.8% (H1 2021: 16.7%). Issues related to taxation are described in Note 14, 'Taxation' in the Annual Report 2021. The Group continues to believe it has made adequate provision for the liabilities likely to arise from periods that are open and not yet agreed by relevant tax authorities. The ultimate liability for such matters may vary from the amounts provided and is depen dent upon the outcome of agreements with relevant tax authorities. Non-controlling interests The allocation of Total earnings to non -controlling interests amounted to \u00a3 315 million (H1 2021: \u00a3 137 million). The increase was primarily due to an increased all ocation of ViiV Healthcare profits of \u00a3268 million (H1 2021: \u00a3 136 million), including the Gilead upfront settlement income partly offset by increased credits for re-measurement of contingent consideration liabilities , as well as higher net profits in som e of the Group's other entities with non -controlling interests. Press release Q2 Results summary Research and development Quarterly performance YTD performance Total and Adjusted results Financial information Issued: Wednesday, 27 July 2022 , London, U.K . 28 The allocation of Adjusted earnings to non -controlling interests amounted to \u00a3 311 million (Q2 2021: \u00a3211 million). The increase in allocation primarily reflected an increased allocation of V iiV Healthcare profits of \u00a3264 million (H1 2021: \u00a3 210 million), as well as higher net profits in some of the Group's other entities with non-controlling interests. Earnings per share from continuing operations Total EPS from continuing operations was 54.8p compared with 50.3p in H1 2021. This primarily reflected the \u00a30.9 billion upfront income received from the settlement with Gilead and increased profits on turnover growth of 25% at CER, partly offset by higher re -measurement charges for contingent consi deration liabilities as well as an unfavourable comparison due to a credit of \u00a3325 million to Taxation in Q2 2021 resulting from the revaluation of deferred tax assets. Adjusted EPS was 67.0p compared with 49.3p in H1 2021, up 36% at AER, 27% at CER, on a 25% CER turnover increase . Adjusted operating profit reflected higher COVID -19 solutions sales at low margin with the reduction to growth from COVID -19 solutions being approximately 2% at AER, 2% at CER. Operating l everage from growth in sal es of Specialty Medicines including HIV and Vaccines, beneficial mix, higher royalty income and a lower effective tax rate was partly offset by higher supply chain, freight and distribution costs and higher non-controlling interests . Profit and earning s per share from discontinued operations Discontinued operations include the Consumer Healthcare business and certain Corporate costs directly attributable to Consumer Healthcare. Profit after taxation from discontinued operations amounted to \u00a3625 million ( H1 2021: \u00a3 648 million) and 10.9p, compared with 11.4p in H1 2021 . The reduction in profit and EPS primarily reflected increased separation costs and increased interest costs. For further details see page 52, discontinued operations. Currency impact on H1 2022 results The results for H1 2022 are based on average exchange rates, principally \u00a31/$ 1.30, \u00a31/\u20ac1.19 and \u00a31/Yen 15 9. Comparative exchange rates are given on page 50. The period -end exchange rates were \u00a31/$ 1.21, \u00a31/\u20ac1.16 and \u00a31/Yen 165. In H1 2022, turnover was up 28% at AER and 25% at CER. Total EPS was 54.8p compared with 50.3p in H1 2021. Adjusted EPS compared with in H1 2021, up 36% at AER and 27% at CER . The favourable currency impact reflected the weakening of Sterling against the US Dollar, part ly offset by strengthening in Sterling against the Euro and Japanese Yen. Exchange gains or losses on the settlement of intercompany transactions had a one percent favourable impact on the nine percentage point favourable currency impact on Adjusted EPS.

The non - cash charges of \u00a3 142 million primarily reflected the write -down of assets in administrative locations and impairment of IT assets. Total cash payments made in H1 2022 were \u00a3 213 million 189 million (H1 2021: \u00a3213 million) relating to the Separation Preparation restructuring programme and \u00a3 24 million (H1 2021: \u00a377 million) relating to other legacy programmes including the settlement of certain charges accrued in previous quarters.

The Group initiated in Q1 2020 a two -year Separation Preparation programme to prepare for the separation of GSK into two companies . The programme aims to: Drive a common approach to R&D with improved capital allocation Align and improve the capabilities and efficiency of global support functions to support new GSK Further optimise the supply chain and product portfolio, including the divestment of non -core assets Prepare Consumer Healthcare to operate as a standalone company The programme continues to target delivery of \u00a3 0.8 billion of annual savings by 2022 and \u00a31.0 billion by 2023, with total costs estimated at \u00a3 2.4 billion, of which \u00a3 1.6 billion is expected to be cash costs. The proceeds of divestments have largely covered the cash costs of the programme. Materially all of the Separation Preparation restructuring programme has been included as part of continuing operations.

This included a net \u00a3 1,031 million accounting charge for the re -measurement of contingent consideration lia bilities and the liabilities for the Pfizer put option and Pfizer and Shionogi preferential dividends -ViiV Healthcare joint Venture (including Shionogi preferential dividends) 841 259 ViiV Healthcare put options and Pfizer preferential dividends 150 (90) Contingent consideration on former Novartis Vaccines business 40 39 Other adjustments 1 38 Total transaction -related charges 1,032 246 The \u00a3841 million charge relating to the contingent consideration for the former Shionogi -ViiV Healthcare joint venture represented an increase in the valuation of the contingent consideration due to Shionogi, as a result of the unwind of the discount for \u00a3196 million and a charge of \u00a3645 million primarily from exchange rates as well as adjustments to sales forecasts. The \u00a3150 million cha rge relating to the ViiV Healthcare put option and Pfizer preferential dividends represented an increase in the valuation of the put option primarily as a result of updated exchange rates as well as adjustments to sales forecasts. The ViiV Healthcare cont ingent consideration liability is fair valued under IFRS. An explanation of the accounting for the non -controlling interests in ViiV Healthcare is set out on page 38. Divestments, significant legal charges , and other items Divestments, significant legal charges and other items primarily included the \u00a392 9 million upfront settlement income received from Gilead, as well as milestone income and gains from a number of asset disposals and certain other Adjusting items. Discontinued operations From Q2 2020, the Group started to report additional costs to prepare for establishment of the Consumer Healthcare business as an independent entity (\"Separation costs\"). These are now presented as part of discontinued operations. T otal separation costs incurred in H1 2022 were \u00a3 302 million (H1 2021: \u00a3109 million). This includes \u00a3 52 million relating to transaction costs incurred in connection with the demerger and preparatory admission costs related to the listing of Haleon .

Q2 2022 Cash generated from operations attributable to continuing operations for the quarter was \u00a31, 584 million (Q2 2021: \u00a3 1,357 million). The increase primarily reflected the increase in operating profit including beneficial exchange and favourable timing of collections partly offs et by increased contingent consideration payments reflecting the Gilead settlement in February 2022, adverse timing of profit share payments for Xevudy sales, a higher seasonal increase in inventory and adverse timing of returns and rebates. Cash generat ed from operations attributable to discontinued operations for the quarter was \u00a3515 million (Q2 2021: \u00a3 482 million). Total cash payments to Shionogi in relation to the ViiV Healthcare contingent consideration liability in the quarter were \u00a3395 million ( Q2 2021: \u00a3203 million), of which \u00a3351 million was recognised in cash flows from operating activities and \u00a344 million was recognised in contingent consideration paid within investing cash flows. These payments are deductible for tax purposes. Free cash inflow from continued operations was \u00a32 64 million for the quarter (Q2 2021: \u00a3 20 million outflow). The increase primarily reflected the increase in operating profit including beneficial exchange and favourable timing of collections and reduced purchase s of intangible assets partly offset by increased contingent consideration payments reflecting the Gilead settlement in February 2022, adverse timing of profit share payments for Xevudy sales, a higher seasonal increase in inventory, higher capital expendi ture and adverse timing of returns and rebates. H1 2022 Cash generated from operations attributable to continuing operations for H1 was \u00a33,9 36 million (H1 2021: \u00a31,759 million). The increase primarily reflected a significant increase in operating profit including the upfront income from the settlement with Gilead, favourable exchange, favourable timing of collections and profit share payments for Xevudy sales, partly offset by increased contingent consideration payments reflecting the Gilead settlement in February 2022 and a higher seasonal increase in inventory. Cash generated from operations attributable to discontinued operations for H1 2022 was \u00a3918 million (H1 2021: \u00a3 564 million). cash payments to Shionogi in relation to the ViiV Healthcare contingent consideration liability in the half year were \u00a3603 million (H1 2021: \u00a3419 million), of which \u00a3534 million was recognised in cash flows from operating activities and \u00a369 million w as recognised in contingent consideration paid within investing cash flows.

The increase primarily r eflected the significant increase in operating profit including the upfront income from the settlement with Gilead, favourable exchange and favourable timing of collections and profit share payments for Xevudy sales. This was partially offset by lower proc eeds from disposals, increased contingent consideration payments reflecting the Gilead settlement in February 2022, higher capital expenditure and a higher seasonal increase in inventory . Total Net debt At 30 June 2022, net debt was \u00a3 21.5 billion, compared with \u00a319.8 billion at 31 December 2021, comprising gross debt of \u00a3 32.4 billion which increased primarily due to the debt issuance for Consumer Healthcare, cash and liquid investments of \u00a3 8.0 billion and cash advances and a short -term loan to a subsidiary of Pfizer Inc. of \u00a32.9 billion, reflecting an on -lend of a portion of the cash received from the proceeds of the Consumer Healthcare bond issuance in line with Pfizer's shareholding of the Consumer Healthcare Joint Venture. Net debt incr eased by \u00a31. 6 billion due to dividends paid to shareholders of \u00a3 2.1 billion, \u00a3 1.6 billion of net adverse exchange impacts from the translation of non -Sterling denominated debt and exchange on other financing items and \u00a30.3 billion dividends to non -controll ing interests from discontinued operations and \u00a30.1 billion capital expenditure for discontinued operations partly offset by \u00a3 1.7 billion free cash flow from continuing operations and \u00a30.8 billion net cash inflow from discontinued operating activities . At 30 June 2022, GSK had short -term borrowings (including overdrafts and lease liabilities) repayable within 12 months of \u00a3 3,327 billion with loans of \u00a3 2.3 billion repayable in the subsequent year.

On 23 June 2021, at the new GSK Investor Update, GSK set out that from 2022 a progressive dividend policy will be implemented guided by a 40 to 60 percent pay -out ratio through the investment cycle. The dividend policy, the total expected cash distribution, and the respective dividend pay -out ratios for GSK remain unchanged. GSK has previously stated that it expected to declare a 27p per share dividend for the first half of 2022, a 22p per share d ividend for the second half of 2022 and a 45p per share dividend for 2023, but that these targeted dividends per share would increase in step with the Share Consolidation to maintain the same aggregate dividend pay -out in absolute Pound Sterling terms. Acc ordingly, using the consolidation ratio, GSK's expected dividend for the second quarter of 2022 converts to 16.25p per new ordinary share . The expected dividend for the second half of 2022 converts to 27.5p per new ordinary share and the expected dividend for 2023 converts to 56.5p per new ordinary share , rounded -up from 56.25p . Payment of dividends The equivalent interim dividend receivable by ADR holders will be calculated based on the exchange rate on 4 October 2022. An annual fee of $0.03 per ADS (or $0.0075 per ADS per quarter) is charged by the Depositary. The ex -dividend date will be 18 August 2022, with a record date of 19 August 2022 and a payment date of 6 October 2022.

Press release Q2 Results summary Research and development Quarterly performance YTD performance Total and Adjusted results Financial information Issued: Wednesday, 27 July 2022 , London, U.K . 37 Total and Adjusted results Total reported results represent the Group's overall performance. GSK also uses a number of adjust ed, non -IFRS, measures to report the performance of its business. Adjusted results and other non -IFRS measures may be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, information presented in accordance with IFRS. Adjusted results are defined below and other non -IFRS measures are defined on page 68. GSK believes that Adjusted results, when considered together with Total results, provide investors, analysts and other stakeholders with helpful complementary information to understand bet ter the financial performance and position of the Group from period to period, and allow the Group's performance to be more easily compared against the majority of its peer companies. These measures are also used by management for planning and reporting pu rposes. They may not be directly comparable with similarly described measures used by other companies. GSK encourages investors and analysts not to rely on any single financial measure but to review GSK's quarterly results announcements, including the financial statements and notes, in their entirety. GSK is committed to continuously improving its financial reporting, in line with evolving regulatory requirements and best practice. In line with this practice, GSK expects to continue to re view and refine its reporting framework. Adjusted results exclude the profits from discontinued operations from the Consumer Healthcare business (see details on page 20 and the following items in relation to our continuing operations from Total results, together with the tax effects of all of these items: amortisation of intangible assets (excluding computer software and capitalised development costs) impairment of intangible assets (excluding computer software) and goodwill Major restructuring costs, which include impairments of tangible assets and computer software, (under specific Board approved programmes that are structural, of a significant scale and where the costs of individual or related projects exceed \u00a325 million), including integratio n costs following material acquisitions transaction -related accounting or other adjustments related to significant acquisitions proceeds and costs of disposal of associates, products and businesses; significant settlement income; significant legal charges (net of insurance recoveries) and expenses on the settlement of litigation and government investigations; other operating income other than royalty income, and other items Costs for all other ordinary course smaller scale restructuring and legal charges and expenses from continuing operations are retained within both Total and Adjusted results. As Adjusted results include the b enefits of Major restructuring programmes but exclude significant costs (such as significant legal, major restructuring and transaction items) they should not be regarded as a complete picture of the Group's financial performance, which is presented in To tal results. The exclusion of other Adjusting items may result in Adjusted earnings being materially higher or lower than Total earnings. In particular, when significant impairments, restructuring charges and legal costs are excluded, Adjusted earnings wi ll be higher than Total earnings. GSK has undertaken a number of Major restructuring programmes in response to significant changes in the Group's trading environment or overall strategy, or following material acquisitions. Within the Pharmaceuticals secto r, the highly regulated manufacturing operations and supply chains and long lifecycle of the business mean that restructuring programmes, particularly those that involve the rationalisation or closure of manufacturing or R&D sites are likely to take severa l years to complete . Costs, both cash and non -cash, of these programmes are provided for as individual elements are approved and meet the accounting recognition criteria. As a result, charges may be incurred over a number of years following the initiation of a Major restructuring programme. Press release Q2 Results summary Research and development Quarterly performance YTD performance Total and Adjusted results Financial information Issued: Wednesday, 27 July 2022 , London, U.K . 38 Significant legal charges and expenses are those arising from the settlement of litigation or government investigations that are not in the normal course and materially larger than more regularly occurring individual matters. They also include certain major legacy matters. Reconciliations between Total and Adjusted results, providing further information on the key Adjusting items, are set out on page s 17, 18, 29 and 30 . GSK provides earnings guidance to the investor community on the basis of Adjusted results. This is in line with peer companies and expectations of the investor community, supporting easier comparison of the Group's performance with its peers. GSK is not able to give guidance for Total results as it ca nnot reliably forecast certain material elements of the Total results, particularly the future fair value movements on contingent consideration and put options that can and have given rise to significant adjustments driven by external factors such as curre ncy and other movements in capital markets. ViiV Healthcare ViiV Healthcare is a subsidiary of the Group and 100% of its operating results (turnover, operating profit, profit after tax) are included within the Group income statement. Earnings are allocated to the three shareholders of ViiV Healthcare on the basis of their respective equity shareholdings (GSK 78.3%, Pfizer 11.7% and Shionogi 10%) and their entitlement to preferential dividends, which are determined by the performance of certain prod ucts that each shareholder contributed. As the relative performance of these products changes over time, the proportion of the overall earnings allocated to each shareholder also changes. In particular, the increasing proportion of sales of dolutegravir and cabotegravir - containing products has a favourable impact on the proportion of the preferential dividends that is allocated to GSK. Adjusting items are allocated to shareholders based on their equity interests. GSK was entitled to approximately 86% of the Total earnings and 83% of the Adjusted earnings of ViiV Healthcare for 202 1. As consideration for the acquisition of Shionogi's interest in the former Shionogi -ViiV Healthcare joint venture in 2012, Shionogi received the 10% equity stake in ViiV Healthca re and ViiV Healthcare also agreed to pay additional future cash consideration to Shionogi, contingent on the future sales performance of the products being developed by that joint venture, dolutegravir and cabotegravir . Under IFRS 3 'Business combinations ', GSK was required to provide for the estimated fair value of this contingent consideration at the time of acquisition and is required to update the liability to the latest estimate of fair value at each subsequent period end. The liability for the contin gent consideration recognised in the balance sheet at the date of acquisition was \u00a3659 million. Subsequent re -measurements are reflected within other operating income/(expense) and within Adjusting items in the income statement in each period. On 1 Febru ary 2022, ViiV Healthcare reached agreement with Gilead to settle the global patent infringement litigation relating to the commercialisation of Gilead's Biktarvy. Under the terms of the global settlement and licensing agreement, Gilead made an upfront pay ment of $1.25 billion to ViiV Healthcare in February 2022. In addition, Gilead will also pay a 3% royalty on all future US sales of Biktarvy and in respect of the bictegravir component of any other future bictegravir -containing products sold in the US. Th ese royalties will be payable by Gilead to ViiV Healthcare from 1 February 2022 until the expiry of ViiV Healthcare's US Patent No. 8,129,385 on 5 October 2027. Gilead's obligation to pay royalties does not extend into any period of regulatory paediatric exclusivity, if awarded . Cash payments to settle the contingent consideration are made to Shionogi by ViiV Healthcare each quarter, based on the actual sales performance and other income of the relevant products in the previous quarter. These payments reduce the balance sheet liability and hence are not recorded in the income statement. The cash payments made to Shionogi by ViiV Healthcare in H1 2022 were \u00a3603 million. As the liability is required to be recorded at the fair value of estimated future payments, there is a significant timing difference between the charges that are recorded in the Total income statement to reflect movements in the fair value of the liability and the actual cash payments made to settle the liability. Further expla nation of the acquisition -related arrangements with ViiV Healthcare are set out on pages 57 and 58 of the Annual Report 2021 .

From Q2 2022, GSK reports results under two segments from continuing operations as the demerger of the Consumer Health care segment was completed on 18 July 2022. Members of the GLT are responsible for each segment. Comparative information in this announc ement has been retrospectively restated on a consistent basis .

The Total R&D segment is the responsibility of the Chief Scientific Officer and President, R&D and is reported as a separate segment. The operating profit of this segment includes R&D activities across Specialty Medicines , including HIV and Vaccines . It includes R&D and some SG&A costs relating to regulatory and other functio ns.

At 30 June 2022, the Group's aggregate provision for legal and other disputes (not including tax matters described on page 27 was \u00a3 0.2 billion (31 December 2021: \u00a3 0.2 billion). The Group may become involved in significant legal proceedings in respect of which it is not possible to meaningfully assess whether the outcome will result in a probable outflow, or to quantify or reliably estimate the liability, if any, that could result from ultimate resolution of the proceedings. In these cases, the Group would provide appropriate disclosures about such cases, but no provision would be made. The ultimate liability for legal claims may vary from the amounts provided and is dependent upon the outcome of litigation proce edings, investigations and possible settlement negotiations. The Group's position could change over time, and, therefore, there can be no assurance that any losses that result from the outcome of any legal proceedings will not exceed by a material amount t he amount of the provisions reported in the Group's financial accounts. There have been no significant legal developments this quarter.

They are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to distribute . Non-current assets included as part of a disposal group are not depreciated or amortised while they are classified as held for distribution. The assets and liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for distribution are presented separately from the oth er assets and liabilities in the balance sheet. A discontinued operation is a component of the entity that has been disposed of or distribut ed or is classified as held for distribution and that represents a separate major line of business. The results of discontinued operations are presented separately in the statement of profit or loss and comparatives are restated on a consistent basis . Accounting policies and basis of preparation This unaudited Results Announcement contains condensed financial informa tion for the three and six months ended 30 June 2022, and should be read in conjunction with the Annual Report 2021, which was prepared in accordance with United Kingdom adopted International Financial Reporting Standards . This Results Announcement has been prepared applying consistent accounting policies to those applied by the Group in the Annual Report 2021. The Group has not identified any changes to its key sources of accounting judgements or estimations of uncerta inty compared with those disclosed in the Annual Report 2021. This Results Announcement does not constitute statutory accounts of the Group within the meaning of sections 434(3) and 435(3) of the Companies Act 2006. The full Group accounts for 202 1 were published in the Annual Report 20 21, which has been delivered to the Registrar of Companies and on which the report of the independent auditor was unqualified and did not contain a statement under section 498 of the Companies Act 2006. COVID -19 pandemic The potential impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on GSK's trading performance and all its principal risks is continually assessed, with appropriate mitigation plans put in place. GSK is encouraged by the uptake in demand in the second quarter for its medicine s and vaccines, particularly Shingrix . The Company remains confident in the underlying demand for its vaccines and medicines, given the number of COVID -19 vaccinations and boosters administered worldwide. The pandemic continues to be challenging to predict and remains a dynamic situation with the worldwide rate of community infections presently increasing due to Omicron subvariants BA.5 and BA.4; these variants of concern and future variants of concern could potentially impact GSK's trading results, clinica l trials, supply continuity and its employees materially. Exchange rates GSK operate s in many countries and earns revenues and incurs costs in many currencies. The results of the Group, as reported in Sterling, are affected by movements in exchange ra tes between Sterling and other currencies. Average exchange rates, as modified by specific transaction rates for large transactions, prevailing during the period , are used to translate the results and cash flows of overseas subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures into Sterling. Period -end rates are used to translate the net assets of those entities. The currencies which most influenced these translations and the relevant exchange rates were : Q2 20 22 Q2 20 21 H1 1.39 1.38 Euro/\u00a3 1.18 1.16 1.19 1.15 1.16 Yen/\u00a3 162 152 159 151 1.39 1.16 1.17 1.19 Yen/\u00a3 165 153 165 153 155 During Q 2 2022 average Sterling exchange rates were stronger against the Yen and the Euro but weaker against the US Dollar compared with the same period in 202 1. Period -end Sterling exchange rates were stronger against the Yen but weaker against the US Dollar and the Euro compared with the 202 1 period -end rates .

This primarily reflected the Total profit for the period and the re -measurement gains on the defined benefit plans . These increases were partially offset by a decrease in fair value of Other investments and by dividends paid during the period. The carrying value of investments in associates and joint ventures at 30 June 2022 was \u00a3 77 million (31 December 202 1: \u00a388 million), with a market value of \u00a3 77 million (31 December 202 1: \u00a388 million). At 30 June 2022, the net deficit on the Group's pension plans was \u00a3 651 million compared with \u00a31,129 million at 31 December 2021. This decrease in the net deficit is primarily related to increases in the long term UK discount rate (3.9% Q2 2022, Q4 2021), partially offset by increases balance credit rate (3.0% Q2 and Euro -zone asset values . The net deficit balance at 30 June 2022 excludes \u00a325 million relating to the discontinued Consumer Healthcare business. The estimated present value of the potential redemption amount of the Pfizer put option related to ViiV Healthcare, recorded in Other payables in Current liabilities, was \u00a3 1,158 million (31 December 202 1: \u00a31,008 million). Contingent consideration amounte d to \u00a3 6,360 million at 3 0 June 2022 (31 December 202 1: \u00a36,076 million), of which \u00a3 5,797 million (31 December 202 1: \u00a35,559 million) represented the estimated present value of amounts payable to Shionogi relating to ViiV Healthcare and \u00a3 546 million (31 Dece mber 202 1: \u00a347 9 million) represented the estimated present value of contingent consideration payable to Novartis related to the Vaccines acquisition. Of the contingent consideration payable (on a post -tax basis) to Shionogi at 3 0 June 2022, \u00a3857 million (31 December 202 1: \u00a3937 million) is expected to be paid within one year .

No material losses are expected to arise from such contingent liabilities. Provision is made for the outcome of legal and tax disputes where it is both probable that the Group will suffer an outflow of funds and it is possible to make a reliable estimate of that outflow. Descriptions of the significant legal disputes to which the Group is a party are set out on page 49.

The main asset is momelotinib which targets the medical needs of myelo fibrosis patients with anaemia . The initial acquisition accounting will be reflected in the third quarter of 2022 , and it is not completed at this date. On 31 May 2022, GSK announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire 100% of Affinivax, Inc. (Affinivax), a clinical -stage biopharmaceutical company based in Cambridge, Boston, Massachusetts focused on pneumococcal vaccine candidates . Under the terms of the agreement, GSK will acquire 100% of the outstanding shares of Affinivax. Th e consideration for the acquisition comprises an upfront payment of $2.1 billion ( \u00a31.7 billion) to be paid upon closing and two potential milestone payments of $0.6 billion (\u00a30.5 billion) to be paid upon the achievement of certain paediatric clinical dev elopment milestones. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including the expiration or early termination of the waiting period under the Hart -Scott -Rodino Anti -Trust Improvements Act of 1976. The transaction is expected to close in th e third quarter of 2022. Divestments On 18 July 2022, GSK plc separated its Consumer Healthcare business from the GSK Group to form Haleon, an independent listed company. The separation was effected by way of a demerger of 80.1% of GSK's 68% holding in the Consumer Healthcare business to GSK shareholders. Following the demerger, 54. 5% of Haleon is held in aggregate by GSK Shareholders, 6 .0% is held by GSK (including shares received by GSK's consolidated ESOT trusts) and 7.5% is held by certain Scottish limited partnerships (SLPs) set up to provide a funding mechanism pursuant to which GSK will provide additional funding for GSK's UK Pension Schemes. The aggregate ownership by GSK (including ownership by the ESOT trust s and SLPs) after the demer ger of 13.5% will be initially measured at fair value with changes through profit or loss. Pfizer continues to hold 32% of Haleon after the demerger. Under IFRIC 17 ' Distributions of Non -cash Assets to Owners' a liability and an equity distribution are m easured at the fair value of the assets to be distributed when the dividend is appropriately authorised and it is no longer at the entity's discretion. The liability and equity movement, and associated gain, will be recognised in Q3 2022 when the demerger distribution was authorised and occurred. The asset distributed was the 54. 5% ownership of the Consumer Healthcare business. The net carrying value of the Consumer Healthcare business, including the retained 13.5% and net of the amount attributable to th e non-controlling interest, was approximately \u00a3 11.5 billion at the end of June. The assets distributed were reduced by Consumer Healthcare transactions up to 18 July that included pre -separation dividends declared and settled after the end of Q2 2022 and before 18 July 2022. Those dividends included: \u00a310.4 billion (\u00a37.1 billion attributable to GSK) of dividends funded by Consumer Healthcare debt that was partially on -lent during Q1 2022 and dividends of \u00a30.6 billion (\u00a30.4 billion attributable to GSK) from available cash balances. GSK's share of the pre -separation dividends and loans are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. The fair value of the 54. 5% ownership of the Consumer Healthcare business distributed was \u00a3 15.5 billion . This was measured by reference to the quoted average Haleon share price over the first five days of trading, this being a fair value measured with observable inputs which is considered to be representative of the fair value at the distribution date. A gain on distribution of this fair value less 54. 5% of the book value of the net assets of the Consumer Healthcare business will be recorded in the Income Statement in Q3 2022. There will be an additional gain to remeasure the retained 13.5% from its book value to fair value of \u00a3 3.9 billion using the same fair value methodol ogy as used for the distributed shares. In addition, there will be a reclassification of the Group's share of cumulative exchange differences arising on translation of the foreign currency net assets of the divested subsidiaries and offsetting net investme nt hedges from Retained Earnings into the Income Statement. All these transactions will be presented in profit from discontinued operations (adjusting results) in Q3 2022. Share Consolidation Following completion of the Consumer Healthcare business demerger on 18 July 2022, GSK plc Ordinary shares were consolidated to maintain share price comparability before and after demerger. The consolidation was approved by GSK shareholders at a General Me eting held on 6 July 2022. Shareholders received 4 new Ordinary shares with a nominal value of 31\u00bc pence each for every 5 existing Ordinary share which had a nominal value of 25 pence each. Earnings per share, diluted earnings per share, adjusted earnings per share and dividends per share were retrospectively adjusted to reflect the Share Consolidation in all the periods presented.

Financial instruments fair value disclosures The following tables categorise the Group's financial assets and liabilities held at fair value by the valuation methodology applied in determining their fair value. Where possible, quoted prices in active markets are used (Level 1). Where such prices are not available, the asset or liability is classified as Level 2, provided all significant inputs to the valuation model used are based on observable market data. If one or more of the significant inputs to the valuation model is not based on observable mark et data, the instrument is classified as Level 3. Other investments classified as Level 3 in the tables below comprise equity investments in unlisted entities with which the Group has entered into research collaborations and also investments in emerging li fe science companies.

There were no transfers from Level 3 as a result of listing of equity inve stments on a recognised stock exchange during the period. In H1 2021, net gains of \u00a399m arose prior to transfer from Level 3 on equity investments which transferred to a Level 1 valuation methodology as a result of such listings . Net gains and losses inclu de the impact of exchange movements . Financial liabilities measured using Level 3 valuation methods at 30 June included \u00a3 5,797 million (H1 202 1: \u00a35,199 million) of contingent consideration for the acquisition in 2012 of the former Shionogi -ViiV Healthcare joint venture and \u00a3 546 million (H1 202 1: \u00a3504 million) of contingent consideration for the acquisition of the Novartis Vaccines business in 2015. Conti ngent consideration is expected to be paid over a number of years and will vary in line with the future performance of specified products, the achievement of certain milestone targets and movements in certain foreign currencies. The financial liabilities a re measured at the present value of expected future cash flows, the most significant inputs to the valuation models being future sales forecasts, the discount rate , the Sterling/US Dollar exchange rate and the Sterling/Euro exchange rate.

There were no transfers between the Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurement categories. Transfers from Level 3 durin g H1 2021 relate to equity investments in companies which were listed on stock exchanges during the period. The following methods and assump tions were used to measure the fair value of the significant financial instruments carried at fair value on the balance sheet: Other investments - equity investments traded in an active market determined by reference to the relevant stock exchange quoted bid price; other equity investments determined by reference to the current market value of similar instruments, recent financing rounds or the discounted cash flows of the underlying net assets Trade receivables carried at fair value - based on invoiced amount Interest rate swaps, foreign exchange forward contracts, swaps and options - based on the present value of contractual cash flows or option valuation models using market -sourced data (exchange rates or interest rates) at the balance sheet date Cash and cash equivalents carried at fair value - based on net asset value of the funds Contingent consideration for business acquisitions and divestments - based on present values of expected future cash flows Press release Q2 Results summary Research and development Quarterly performance YTD performance Total and Adjusted results Financial information Issued: Wednesday, 27 July 2022 , London, U.K . 57 There are no material differences between the carrying value of the Group's other financial assets and liabilities and their estimated fair values, with the exception of bonds, for which the carrying values and fair values are set out in the table below: 30 June 202 2 31 December 202 1 Carrying value \u00a3m Fair value \u00a3m Carrying value \u00a3m Fair value \u00a3m Bonds in a designated hedging Other bonds (15,830) (16,688) (9,341) - - (30,749) (31,037) (22,355) (26,057) The following methods and assumptions are used to estimate the fair values of financial assets and liabilities which are not measured at fair value on the balance sheet: Receivables and payables, including put options, carried at amortised cost - approximates to the carrying amount Liquid investments - approximates to the carrying amoun t Cash and cash equivalents carried at amortised cost - approximates to the carrying amount Short -term loans, overdrafts and commercial paper - approximates to the carrying amount because of the short maturity of these instruments Long -term loans - based on quoted market prices (a Level 1 fair value measurement) in the case of European and US Medium Term Notes; approximates to the carrying amount in the case of other fixed rate borrowings and floating rate bank loa ns Put option Other payables in Current liabilities includes the present value of the expected redemption amount of the Pfizer put option over its non -controlling interest in ViiV Healthcare of \u00a3 1,158 million.

Infectious Diseases bepirovirsen (HBV ASO) Bepirovirsen is a potential new treatment option for people with chronic hepatitis B as either a monotherapy (B -Clear) or combination therapy with both existing (B -Together) and novel treatments to explore additional combinations in the future. In June 2022, GSK announced promising interim results from the B -Clear phase IIb trial showing that bepiro virsen reduced levels of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA after 24 weeks' treatment in people with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). These data were presented in an oral late -breaker session at the European Association for the Study of the Liver's International Liver Congress (ILC) in June 2022 in London, UK. The final results from the trial will be submitted for presentation at a scientific congress later this year and published in a peer -reviewed journal. GSK also presented an abstract at ILC showing preclinical evidence that bepirovirsen harbours intrinsic immunostimulatory activity via Toll -like receptor 8 (TLR8), correlating with clinical efficacy from the phase IIa trial. GSK announced that a phase III trial evaluating bepirovirsen as a monotherapy treating people with CHB is anticipated to start in the first half of 2023.

The data showed 14 consecutive clinical complete responses in patients who received Jemperli as a first -line treatment for mismatch repair -deficient (dMMR) locally advanced rectal cancer. The research was also published in The New England Journal of Medicine , and initial data were presented earlier this year at the ASCO Gastrointestinal Cancers S ymposium. GSK continues to closely collaborate with MSKCC to advance this research and expand the trial for patients with rectal cancer. Also, at ASCO, results from the GARNET trial Cohorts A1 and A2 in advanced/recurrent dMMR/microsatellite instability - high or proficient/stabl e endometrial cancer was presented, which will inform long -term use of Jemperli in this patient population. In addition, long -term outcomes from the GARNET trial Cohorts A1 and F were shared, covering the efficacy and safety profile of Jemperli in certain patients with dMMR recurrent or advanced solid tumours, including endometrial cancer.

In our November 2021 annual risk review, the Board agreed our principal risks for 2022, which remain largely unchanged, with the evolution of Privacy to Data Ethics and Privacy, Non -Promotional Engagement to Scientific and Patient Engagement and Transformation and Separation to Separation. Additionally, we agreed that Environmental Sustainability , the risks relating to which are described on pages 284 to 285 of our Annual Report, will be managed under our ESG areas of focus. We describe our risk management process on page 46 of our 2021 Annual Report, along with more detailed information on our risks, including definitions, trend s, potential impact, context and mitigation activities as set out on pages 47 to 48 and pages 275 to 287 of our 2021 Annual Report . Additionally, we include risks and uncertainties relating to the COVID -19 pandemic in our Annual Report (see page 54). 2022 Principal Risks Risk Title Risk Definition Patient safety Failure to appropriately collect, review, follow up, or report human safety information (HSI), including adverse events from all potential sources, and to act on any relevant findings in a timely manner. Product quality Failure by GSK, its contractors or suppliers to ensure: Appropriate controls and governance of quality in product development; Compliance with good manufacturing practice or good distribution practice regulations in commercial or clinical trials manufacture and distribution activities; Compliance with the terms of GSK product licences and supporting regulatory activities. Financial controls and reporting Failure to comply with current tax laws or incurring significant losses due to treasury activities; failure to report accurate financial information in compliance with accounting standards and applicable legislation .

Scientific and patient engagement We engage externally with HCPs, HCOs, payers, governments, patients/general public and others, to gain insights, educate and communicate the science of our medicines and/or associated disease areas to inform patient care decisions. These interactions must be legitimate, conducted appropriately and transparently in compliance with local laws, regulations, Industry Codes, GSK business and ethics standards . Data ethics and privacy With increasing ease and opportunities for use and re -use of data through artificial intelligence, data analytics and automation in business decisions and processes, complex ethical dilemmas emerge irrespective of legal compliance, particularly around its application to personal data. Unethical use of data or the failure to collect, secure, use, share and destroy Personal Information in accordance with data privacy laws can lead to harm to individuals and GSK . Research practices Potential failure to adequately conduct ethical and credible pre-clinical and clinical research. In addition, it is the failure to engage in scientific activities that are consistent with relevant laws, industry practices, and GSK values and expectations. It comprises the following sub -risks: Data Governance; Laboratory Research; and Human Subject Research . Environment, health and safety (EHS) Failure in management of: Execution of hazardous activities; GSK's physical assets and infrastructure; Handling and processing of hazardous chemicals and biological agents; Control of releases of substances harmful to the environment in both the short and long term; leading to incidents which could disrupt our R&D and Supply activities, harm employees, harm the communities and harm the local environments in which we operate .

Press release Q2 Results summary Research and development Quarterly performance YTD performance Total and Adjusted results Financial information Issued: Wednesday, 27 July 2022 , London, U.K . 68 Reporting definitions Total , Continuing and Adjusted results Total reported results represent the Group's overall performance including discontinued operations. Continuing results represent s performance excluding discontinued operations. GSK also uses a number of adjusted, non -IFRS, measures to report the performance of its business. Adjusted results and other non -IFRS measures may be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, information presented in accordance with IFRS. Adjusted results are defined on page 37 and other non -IFRS measures are defined below and are based on continuing operations . Free cash flow from continuing operations Free cash flow is defined as the net cash inflow/outflow from continuing operating activities less capital expenditure on property , plant and equipment and intangible assets, contingent consideration payments, net finance costs, and dividends paid to non -controlling interests plus proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, and dividends received fr om joint ventures and associates (all attributable to continuing operations) . It is used by management for planning and reporting purposes and in discussions with and presentations to investment analysts and rating agencies. Free cash flow growth is calcul ated on a reported basis. A reconciliation of net cash inflow from continuing operations to free cash flow from continuing operations is set out on page 58. Free cash flow conversion Free cash flow conversion is free cash flow from continuing operations as a percentage of earnings attributable to shareholders from continuing operations . Working capital Working capital represents inventory and trade receivables less trade payables. CER and AER growth In order to illustrate underlying performance, it is the Group's practice to discuss its results in terms of constant exchange rate (CER) growth. This represents growth calculated as if the exchange rates used to determine the results of o verseas companies in Sterling had remained unchanged from those used in the comparative period. CER% represents growth at constant exchange rates. \u00a3% or AER% represents growth at actual exchange rates. Total Net debt Net debt is defined as total borrowings less cash, cash equivalents, liquid investments, and short -term loans to third parties that are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value (including those classified as assets and liabilities held for distribution ). COVID -19 solutions COVID -19 solutions include the sales of pandemic adjuvant and other COVID -19 solutions including vaccine manufacturing and Xevudy and the associated costs but does not include reinvestment in R&D. This categorisation is used by management and we believe is helpful to investors through providing clarity on the results of the Group by showing the contribution to growth from COVID -19 solutions . New GSK New GSK refers to the current GSK group excluding the Haleon business that has been demerged. General Medicines General Medicines are usually prescribed in the primary care or community settings by general healthcare practitioners. For GSK, this includes medicines in inhaled respiratory, dermatology, antibiotics and other diseases. Specialty Medicines Specialty Medicines are typically prescription medicines used to treat complex or rare chronic conditions. For GSK, this comprises medicines in inf ectious diseases, HIV, oncology, immunology and respiratory. Biopharma Biopharma refers to sales in Commercial Operations. Share Consolidation Shareholders received 4 new Ordinary shares with a nominal value of 31\u00bc pence each for every 5 existing Ordinary share which had a nominal value of 25 pence each. Earnings per share, diluted earnings per share, adjusted earnings per share and dividends per share were retrospectively adjusted to reflect the Share Consolidation in all the periods presented. Earnings per share Earnings per share has been retrospectively adjusted for the Share Consolidation on 18 July 2022 , applying a ratio of 4 new Ordinary shares for every 5 existing Ordinary shares .

Press release Q2 Results summary Research and development Quarterly performance YTD performance Total and Adjusted results Financial information Issued: Wednesday, 27 July 2022 , London, U.K . 69 Guidance , assumptions and cautionary statements 2022 guidance GSK now expects 2022 sales to increase between 6 to 8 per cent and Adjusted operating profit to increase between 13 to 15 per cent. Adjusted Earnings per share is expected to grow around 1 per cent lower than Operating Profit. T his guidance is provided at CER and excludes the commercial benefit of COVID -19 solutions. Assumptions related to 2022 guidance In outlining the guidance for 2022, the Group has made certain assumptions about the healthcare sector, the different markets in which the Group operates and the delivery of revenues and financial benefits from its current portfolio, pipeline and restructuring programmes. This guidance relates only to GSK. With the momentum from the business performa nce to date, GSK now expects 2022 sales to increase between 6 to 8 per cent and Adjusted operating profit to increase between 13 to 15 per cent, excluding any contributions from COVID -19 solutions. Adjusted Earnings per share is expected to grow around 1 per cent lower than Operating Profit. We have delivered first half performance ahead of our full year guidance, slightly better than expected, informed by strong business delivery and the dynamics of prior year comparators. Predominantly reflecting a more challenging H2 2021 sales comparator as well as the expected increase in R&D spend, we expect lower reported growth in the second half. Key external factors that will influence the second half of 2022 include the continued risk from COVID -19 dynamics and possible developments in the current uncertain global economic environment. Notwithstanding uncertain economic conditions across many markets in which we operate, we observe evidence of healthcare systems recovering and continue to expect full year sales of Specialty Medicines to grow approximately 10% CER and sales of General Medicines to show a slight decrease, primarily reflecting increased genericisation of established Respiratory medicines. Vaccines sales are now expected to grow at a low to mid-teens percentage at CER for the year. Specifically for Shingrix, we continue to expect strong double -digit growth and record annual sales in 2022, based on strong demand in existing markets and continued geographical expansion . However , we do expect sales in the second half to be slightly lower than in the first half of 2022 due to some channel stocking in the first half in the US. These planning assumptions as well as operating profit guidance and dividend expectations assume no mater ial interruptions to supply of the Group's products, no material mergers, acquisitions or disposals, no material litigation or investigation costs for the Company (save for those that are already recognised or for which provisions have been made) and no change in the Group's shareholdings in ViiV Healthcare. The assumptions also assume no material changes in the healthcare environment or unexpected significant changes in pricing as a result of government or competitor action. The 2022 guidance factors in all divestments and product exits announced to date. The Group's guidance assumes successful delivery of the Group's integration and restructuring plans. Material costs for investment in new product launches and R&D have been factored into the expectatio ns given. Given the potential development options in the Group's pipeline, the outlook may be affected by additional data -driven R&D investment decisions. The guidance is given on a constant currency basis. Assumptions and cautionary statement regarding f orward -looking statements The Group's management believes that the assumptions outlined above are reasonable, and that the guidance, outlooks, ambitions and expectations described in this report are achievable based on those assumptions. However, given the forward -looking nature of these guidance, outlooks, ambitions and expectations, they are subject to greater uncertainty, including potential material impacts if the above assumptions are not realised, and other material impacts related to foreign exchange fluctuations, macro - economic activity, the impact of outbreaks, epidemics or pandemics, such as the COVID -19 pandemic and ongoing challenges and uncertainties posed by the COVID -19 pandemic for businesses and governments around the world, changes in legis lation, regulation, government actions or intellectual property protection, product development and approvals, actions by our competitors, and other risks inherent to the industries in which we operate.

What we have reviewed The condensed financial information comprises: the income statement and statement of comprehensive income for the three month period ended 3 0 June 2022 on pages 39 to 40; the balance sheet as at 3 0 June 2022 on page 44; the statement of changes in equity for the six month period then ended on page 45; the cash flow statement for the six month period then ended on page 46 and; the accounting policies and basis of preparation and the explanatory notes to the condensed financial information on pages 41 to 43 and 47 to 58 that have been prepared applying consistent accounting policies to those applied by the Group in the Annual Report 2021, which was prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\") as adopted by the United Kingdom. We have read the other information contained in the Results Announcement, including the non -IFRS measures contained on pages 41 to 43 and 47 to 58, and considered whether it contains any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the informati on in the condensed set of financial statements. This report is made solely to the Company in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements (UK and Ireland) 2410 \"Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity\" issued by the Financial Reporting Council. Our work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company those matters we are required to state to it in an independent review report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permit ted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company, for our review work, for this report, or for the conclusions we have formed. Directors' responsibilities The Results Announcement of the Company, including the condens ed interim financial information, is the responsibility of, and has been approved by, the directors. The directors are responsible for preparing the Results Announcement of the Company in accordance with the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules of th e United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority. As disclosed in Note 1, the annual financial statements of the Company are prepared in accordance with United Kingdom adopted International Financial Reporting Standards. The condensed financial information included in this Results Announcement have been prepared in accordance with United Kingdom adopted International Accounting Standard 34, \"Interim Financial Reporting\". Our responsibility Our responsibility is to express to the Company a conclusion on the condensed financial information in the Results Announcement based on our review. Our conclusion, including our Conclusions Relating to Going Concern, are based on procedures that are less extensive than audit procedures, as described in the Scope of Review paragraph of this report. Conclusion Relating to Going Concern Based on our review procedures, which are less extensive than those performed in an audit as described in the Basis for Conclusion section of this report, nothing has come to our attention to suggest that the directors have inappropriately adopted the goin g concern basis of accounting or that the directors have identified material uncertainties relating to going concern that are not appropriately disclosed. This conclusion is based on the review procedures performed in accordance with this ISRE (UK), howe ver future events or conditions may cause the entity to cease to continue as a going concern. Scope of review We conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements (UK and Ireland) 2410 \"Review of Interim Financial Info rmation Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity\" issued by the Financial Reporting Council for use in the United Kingdom. A review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance tha t we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. Conclusion Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the condensed financ ial information in the Results Announcement for the three and six months ended 30 June 2022 are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with United Kingdom adopted International Accounting Standard 34 and the Disclosure Guidance and Transpare ncy Rules of the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority.
