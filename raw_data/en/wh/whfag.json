as one of the departments of the College of Liberal Arts. During the first fifteen years the nursing programs became so varied, the enrollment so large, and the contribution to the total community so important that reorganization was necessary. In 1944, at the request of the College of Liberal Arts, the Board of Education authorized the establishment of the College of Nursing. The College began to function as one of the components of the University in the spring of 1945. In 1947 under the leadership of Katherine Faville, the College's first dean, the faculty assumed full responsibility for teaching clinical nursing courses. This was the first time the shifting of clinical teaching from hospital staff to nursing faculty was initiated. This model has now been incorporated by colleges and schools of nursing. Graduates from this program were eligible to take the examination for the regis tered nurse license. Since 1945, the College has had programs leading to the degree of Master of Science in Nursing. These programs offer advanced practice preparation for nurse practitioners and clinical nurse specialists. In 1975, the College began offering a program leading to the Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing. The Ph.D. summer option was initiated in 1984. College of Nursing Mission Statement The mission of the College of Nursing is to create and translate knowledge and to educate a diverse student body prepared to excel as clinicians, scholars, and leaders who improve health in local and global communities. MSN Mission Statement The mission of the Master of Science in Nursing Program is to prepare Advanced Practice Registered Nurses to critically evaluate and apply scientific evidence to clinical practice to provide high -quality health care to individuals and communities and to improve health outcomes. Graduate Certificate Mission St atement s The mission of the Graduate Certificate in Adult -Gerontology Acute Care Nurse Practitioner is to prepare Advanced Practice Registered Nurses to evaluate critically and apply scientific evidence to clinical practice to provide high- quality health care to individuals with critical, acute, or chronic healthcare needs to improve health outcomes. The mission of the Graduate Certificate in Nurse -Midwife is to prepare Advanced Practice Registered Nurses to critically evaluate and apply scientific evidence to clinical practice to provide high -quality women's health, newborn and midwifery care to individuals, families, and communities and to improve health outcomes. The mission of the Graduate Certificate in Pediatric Nursing Practitioner- Acute Care Program is to prepare Advanced Practice Registered Nurses to critically evaluate and apply scientific evidence to clinical practice to provide high- quality health pediatric care in acute care settings to individuals and families and to improve health outcomes. OVERVIEW OF COLLEGE vii The mission of the Graduate Certificate in Pediatric Nursing Practitioner- Primary Care Program is to prepare Advanced Practice Registered Nurses to critically evaluate and apply scientific evidence to clinical practice to provide high- quality health pediatric care in primary care settings to individuals, families, and communities and to improve health outcomes. The mission of the Graduate Certificate Program in Complementary Therapies in Healthcare is to prepare nurses at the graduate level to understand Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) therapies, their effects on the body and mind, research on their effectiveness and the cultural aspects of their use. The mission of the Graduate Certificate in Nursing Education is to prepare nurses for teaching positions in educational and service settings. The certificate provides nurses with essential knowledge and skills in teaching, program development, evaluation, and clinical instruction. Vision The College of Nursing will be the leader in nursing research and education, known for our commitment to and impact on urban healt h Philosophy The College of Nursing functions within the context of Wayne State University and supports the central goals and mission of the University. These goals are to nurture the intellectual abilities of students and faculty and to provide education, research, and community service. As an urban university, Wayne State accepts responsibility for a reciprocal partnership with the community, using resources and knowledge in dealing wit h urban life. Nursing is an academic discipline and profession. As a discipline, nursing develops its body of knowledge using research as the major mode of discovery and validation. The scholarly environment of the university enhances the research and theory development endeavors of the College of Nursing. As a profession, nursing uses knowledge creatively in response to the health care needs of society. Experience in a variety of clinical settings is the primary mode for the development of practice compete ncies. The urban context of the University provides a setting for exploring the application of knowledge to professional nursing practice. The concepts that order the discipline and profession of nursing are derived from knowledge about human beings, health care, and environment. These concepts give identity to professional nursing practice, direct inquiry, and theory development. The College of Nursing supports the importance of the liberal arts, the humanities, and sciences in nursing education . The f aculty believes that programs designed for the preparation of nurses must be composed of the intellectual, social, and technical components of a liberal and professional education that are available to students within an institution of higher learning. Facult y affirms the necessity and value of clinical practice within a professional nursing program. Experience in a variety of clinical settings is the primary mode for the development of practice competencies. Faculty believes that learners are self -directed an d actively participate in the learning process. Self -direction encourages the development of personal goals and values significant to the profession of nursing. Knowledge acquisition, capacity for critical inquiry, reflection and decision making prepare s learners for responding to issues that confront them as professionals. Learners from diverse backgrounds enter the College of Nursing to begin or continue their education within the academic discipline of nursing. The f aculty believes the diverse character istics of its students add to the richness of the learning experience. The program seeks to accommodate the special needs, interests, and abilities of the students. The faculty supports the right of students to question, challenge, and debate within the co ntext of inquiry as an essential ingredient in the students' development. Continuing evaluation on the part of students and faculty is essential to sustain the integrity of the program. viii The faculty of the College of Nursing, as members of the academic comm unity, recognizes that its professional functions extend beyond contributions to formal teaching. Research, practice, and community service are also expectations of the faculty role. The faculty views as essential academic freedom, shared governance, opportunity to develop knowledge, and responsibility to incorporate new knowledge into teaching and nursing practice. The faculty assumes responsibility for enhancing the image of the College of Nursing and the University locally and nationally through various avenues including research, scholarship, practice, consultation, and participatory decision making. ix TABLE OF CONTENTS TABLE ADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURE x OFFICE OF STUDENT AFFAIRS College of Nursing - Office of Student Affairs (OSA) Cohn Building, Suite 10 (313) 577- 4082, toll free (888) 837 E-mail: nursinginfo@ wayne.edu website: www.nursing.wayne.edu The Office of Student Affairs (OSA) is responsible for a variety of activities, including recruitment, admissions, orientation, retention, academic support, and undergraduate academic advising.

Students are expected to meet these standards of excellence. The following scholarship policies must be achieved to enable a student to progress toward degree completion. Regulation Topic MSN/Graduate Certificate Enrollment Regulations During course work, students must be enrolled each semester during the academic year (i.e., Fall/Winter) while in a MSN or graduate certificate program, unless they have an approved leave of absence on file. Students may request a leave of absence with their academic advisor and must complete the appropriate paperwork. a. MSN students who fail to enroll in both Fall AND Winter semester of a given academic year and who do not have a leave of absence form on file will be reviewed by the MSN Program Committee and may be excluded from the program. b. A leave of absence does not s top the time allowed for completing the degree. Progression in Non - clinical courses MSN students must maintain an overall GPA in master's coursework of B (3.00) in order to progress in the program. a. B- is an acceptable grade (except in the clinical courses) as long as the student maintains a GPA average of B (3.00) in MSN course work. b. The GPA cannot be below a 3.00 for more than one semester. c. There is no limit in the number of B - grades the student receives, as long as, the student maintains a 3.00 average . Progression in Clinical Course The following academic regulations are related to all clinical nursing courses (i.e., advanced assessment [NUR 7030] and all specialty clinical courses): a. Cli nical course grades are comprised of two components, didactic and clinical. Students must achieve a B (83%) or higher in both components to satisfactorily pass a clinical course. b. In calculating the final score, if both the didactic and clinical components are above 83%, the grades are weighted according to the course syllabus, then combined, and a final letter grade is assigned in accordance with the graduate grading scale. c. In calculating the final score, if eithe r the didactic or clinical components of the course are below 83% the grades are weighted according to the course syllabus and combined as follows: i. If the combined course grade is above 83%, the highest course grade that can be assigned is B minus. ii. If the combined course grade is below 83% , the actual calculated grade is assigned. d. In calculating the final score, if both the didactic and clinical component of the course are below 83% the grades are weighted according to the course syllabus, then com bined, and a final letter grade is assigned. e. A grade of less than 83% in a clinical nursing course is unsatisfactory for progression in the clinical sequence. f. A student is allowed to retake an \"unsatisfactory\" clinical course one time. If the student does not achieve a B in the repeated course the student will be excluded from the Program. Course Repeating A student must repeat a graduate course in which a grade of C+, C, or F is earned in a non-clinical course or a B - in a clinical course. A student must repeat a graduate course in which a B - or below is earned in a clinical course. An individual course may be repeated only once. No more than two courses may be repeated . ACADEMICS 2 The original grade for the course will remain on the student's transcript, b ut only the grade received in repetition of the course will be used in computation of the student's honor point average. Students will receive University financial aid for one repeat of a course. A student must complete a \"Request to Repeat a Graduate Course\" form, which is available on the CON website at www.nursing.wayne.edu . The completed form should be signed by their advisor and submitted to the Dir ector of Advanced Practice and Graduate Certificate Programs for approval. WF or F grades Students who earn a WF or F (74% or below) grade are at risk for exclusion from the program. a. Although a grade of WF or F does not result in an automatic exclusion from the program, the student's overall performance in the program (e.g., grades, attainment of benchmarks) to date will be reviewed by the MSN Program Committee. Exclusion Policies MSN students will be excluded from the program for one of the following reasons: a. Failure to maintain an overall GPA of 3.0 for more than one semester. b. Students who receive a third unsatisfactory grade. c. Academic or nonacademic misconduct as defined by WSU. d. Unsafe or unethical practice behavior. Grade/Exclusion Appe als Grade Appeal Only the manner in which the grade was assigned can be appealed. The student assumes the burden of proof in the appeals process. Three grounds for grade appeals exist: 1. the application of non-academic criteria in the grading process, as listed in the university's non- discrimination/affirmative action statute: race, color, sex (including gender identity), national origin, religion, age, sexual orientation, familial status, marital status, height, weight, disability, or veteran status; 2. Sexual harassment or discrimination; or 3. Evaluation of student work by criteria not directly reflective of performance relative to course requirements. A student who disputes the final grade awarded for any of the above reasons should follow the steps outlined in the grade appeal process. Unsafe Practice and Exclusion Appeal: Students must contact the College of Nursing, Assistant Dean of Enrollment and Student Affairs for the steps in the appeal process for unsafe practice or program exclusion within ten (10) days of oral notice or postmark of written notice of unsafe practice. Academic and Non -Academic Misconduct Appea ls: All reports and student appeals for academic and non- academic misconduct should follow the university code of conduct policies. Progression to Candidacy Requirements Not Applicable for MSN students Timeline MSN Students have a six (6) year time limit to complete all requirements for the master's degree.

Students must submit a request for extension, along with a letter of support from their MSN/graduate certificate program advisor to the MSN/GC Committee 6 months prior to their expiration date. Subsequent extensions will not be considered in the absence of substantial progress during the previous year. A student whose time limit has expired is regarded by the requisite committee as automatically terminated from the program u nless the department submits an 3 appropriately justified request for a time extension and the Graduate School approves that request. Graduate Certificate Students have a three (3) year time limit to complete all requirements for the graduate certificate programs. The three -year period begins with the end of the semester during which the student was admitted and was taking course work toward meeting the requirements of the degree Students whose three -year time limit is expiring may be considered for an extension. Students must submit a request for extension, along with a letter of support from their MSN/graduate certificate program advisor to the MSN/GC Committee 6 months prior to their expiration date. Subsequent extensions will not be considered in the absence of substantial progress during the previous year. A student whose time limit has expired is regarded by the requisite committee as automatically terminated from the program unless the department submits an appropriately justified request for a time extension and the Graduate School approves that request. Revalidation of Courses The MSN/GC committee reserves the right of revalidation of over -age (10 years ) credits. Credits earned at WSU and other institutions may require revalidation at the time of WSU admission. In revalidation cases, the advisor and the student must set a terminal date for completion of all degree requirements, including such additional requirements as may be prescribed to revalidate the over -age credits. Residency requirements MSN A minimum of twenty -four (24) semester hours of the degree must be earned at WSU.

Attendance Regular punctual attendance in classes and clinical practice is expected. It is imperative that students maintain a perfect or near -perfect attendance record. Tardiness and/or failure to report to class can result in a lowering of the final course grade or exclusion from the course. Residency Requirement A minimum of twenty -four (24) semester credits must be in residence at Wayne State University for completion of the m aster's degree. Transfer of Graduate Credit In work toward the master's degree, credit beyond the twenty- four (24) credits , which must be earned in residence, may be transferred from accredited graduate schools, provided such credit is \"B\" or better and certified as graduate -level credit on an official transcript. The petition must be supported by an official transcript showing a minimum grade of \"B\" for the courses to be transferred. \"B -minus\" credit is not acceptable for transfer. Transfer credits must b e appropriate to the student's degree. Admission to Wayne State University based upon a previously earned master's degree does not guarantee that those credits are applicable to a graduate degree at Wayne State University. Procedure: Petitions for transfer of graduate credit to be taken at another institution after admission to WSU must be filed prior to the student's enrollment in the course. Prior advisor's approval is not binding unless the Graduate Officer of the College of Nursing has also approved the student's petition. Time Limitation Students have a six -year time limit to complete all requirements for the master's degree. The six- year period begins with the end of the semester during which the student has taken work which applies toward meeting the requirements of the degree. The Colle ge reserves the right of revalidation of over -age credits. Students are not permitted to revalidate credits earned at other institutions. In revalidation cases, the 5 advisor and the student must set a terminal date for completion of all degree requirements, including such additional requirements as may be prescribed to revalidate the over -age credits. Time extensions beyond these conditions are authorized only for conditions clearly beyond the student's control. Guidelines for MSN Program Extension Request m ay be obtained from the Office of Student Affairs. Graduate Course Repeat Policy and Procedure A graduate student may repeat up to two courses one time, with prior approval, if a grade of C+ or lower was earned. NOTE: The opportunity to repeat a graduate course is determined by the student's ability to progress in the program as determined by the academic regulations of the college and with approval by the Director of Advanced Practice and Graduate Certificate Programs . Procedure: Approval to repeat a course must be obtained prior to registration . The \"Request to Repeat a Graduate Course\" form can be found here: www.gradschool.wayne.edu/ form s/RepeatCourse.pdf . The student is responsible for completing the form and obtaining the proper signatures before registering for the course. Failure to obtain prior approval to repeat a course means that grades earned in the original course and in the re peat course will be used in determining the student's honor point average. Mark of \"I\" - Incomplete The University policy on the mark of \"I\" (Incomplete) can be found in the University Bulletin. To ensure completion to the policy, the College of Nursing Faculty Association approved on February 2, 1994 the following College policy. An \"I\" is appropriate if the student encounters a catastrophic situation which prevents completion of the final requirements of the course. An \"I\" is not appropriate for unsatis factory performance. In the event an \"I\" is given, the time limit for completion will be determined by the instructor but may not exceed one year. Withdrawal from Nursing Courses A student requesting a withdrawal will be assigned a Withdrawal Passing (WP), Withdrawal Failing (WF), or Withdrawal Non -Attendance (WN). The faculty of the College of Nursing supports the University policy which stipulates that the use of an \"I\" or \"W\" to mask unsuccessful performance is inappropriate After the 4th week of class the instructor must approve a withdrawal. Students must show diligence and are normally expected to complete the courses they elect. Irresponsible attendance is wasteful of both student and University resources. Those students, who consistently receive excessive marks of \"I\" (Incomplete), and \"W\" (Withdrawal), may be refused the privilege of further registration by the Dean or Dean's designee of their school or college. Student s experiencing attendance difficulties should seek counseling from appropriate college or university offices. Authorized Leave of Absence Policy A student may request an Authorized Leave of Absence when personal circumstances (e.g., birth, death, serious illness, major financial challenges), interfere with the student's ability to devote sufficient time to academic pursuits to assure a reasonable expectation of success. Authorized Leaves of Absence are requested from and granted by the Associate Dean for A cademic and Clinical Affairs and the Director of Advanced Practice and Graduate Certificate Programs in consultation with the academic advisor. 6 1. Currently enrolled students will be granted a Leave of Absence only if they are passing all nursing courses at 75% or better (UG) or 83% or better (Graduate) and are therefore eligible for Withdrawal Passing (WP) grades. 2. Currently enrolled students who will not be registered for either Fall or Winter semester, or both, must have a Leave of Absence approved and on file. 3. The student considering a request for an authorized Leave of Absence should contact the Office of Student Affairs for an explanation of the process regarding the leave of absence and to determine if she or he is eligible. 4. A Leave of Absence is approved for a maximum of 1 year. A student who receives an authorized Leave of Absence and returns before the Leave of Absence expires is guaranteed a space in the program. An authorized Leave of Absence is not considered a withdrawal from the program. 5. A student who does not re -enter the program by the end of the authorized period will be considered a voluntary withdrawal. 6. A student who withdraws from any nursing program for any reason must reapply to the College of Nursing as a new applicant. A student who takes an unauthorized leave of absence or fails to register during each academic year (both Fall and Winter semest ers) will be considered to have voluntarily withdrawn from the program and must apply for admission to the College of Nursing as a new applicant. 7. A grade of Withdrawal Pass (WP) is not the same as an authorized leave of absence. 8. All approved leave of absence requests will require notification of the student's academic advisor, Director of Advanced Practice and Graduate Certificate Programs, Office of Student Affairs, and specialty coordinators as applicable. A student is considered withdrawn from the MSN program if he or she fails to register for any of the required two consecutive semesters (summers not included). To return to the program after withdrawal for non -registration, the student must seek reinstatement from the Director of Advanced Practice and Graduate Certificate Programs and MSN Program Committee and register for the remaining requirements for the degree. Additional registration may be required. NLFP Program All MSN students who elect to participate in the N urse Faculty Loan Program (N FLP) and accept NFLP award monies for even one semester must complete all of the GCNE courses prior to graduation, unless 1) you already have a Master's degree in Nursing Education, OR 2) you have taught the equivalent of a full-time year (equivalent of a WSU workload, e.g. lead 2 didactic courses per semester and 3 clinical groups in each semester). Students are required to provide documentation that they taught at an accredited nursing school with both didactic and clinical teaching experiences and the PI of the NFLP Program will review the documentation for determination of GCNE exemption. Failure to fulfill the obligations of the GCNE courses for NFLP may delay MSN graduation. 7 Distance Learning Program The College of Nursing's D istance Learning Program is a live learning environment. Nursing students from around the region participate in real -time classes that are being held on campus. Students residing throughout Michigan and the Toledo, Ohio area attend classes in Detroit from locations such as Lansing , Kalamazoo, Grand Rapids, Traverse City, Marquette , Flint, Michigan and Toledo, Ohio. Synchronous distance learning is offered to students who meet eligibility requirements. Residency requirements must be met and students are required to be in Michigan for the clinical experiences (NUR 7030, APRN clinicals, and courses requiring a clinical permit). Information about the distance learning program is available on the website a t http://nursing.wayne.edu/programs/distance -learning.php There are eight distance- enabled learning spaces in the College of Nursing. These rooms all have audiovisual technology that enables the distance students to see and hear everything being shared by the instructor and participate in the discussion. Both local and distance students can see and speak to each other during class as the distance students have a visual as well as an au dio presence in the classroom. Distance learning students can attend class, give presentations, take exams, and collaborate on projects all while remaining off campus. However, there may be a few instances throughout the program where distance students are required to travel to campus. Advanced notice will be given in the syllabus, and the distance learning coordinator can assist with arrangements . Distance Learning Policies Distance Learning is a privilege to students offered by the College of Nursing. This document explains policies of the Distance Learning (DL) Program. If a policy is violated, the student will forfeit distance learning privileges. Some courses may require students to attend class -related events at the Detroit campus. These events wil l be identified in course syllabi. I. Distance Course Scheduling and Admissions: A. Scheduling: All distance sections within a specific course will connect to one designated on- campus section. For example, (and hypothetically) all distance sections for NUR 7015 Research for Evidence Based Nursing will connect to NUR 7015 section 001 instead of choos ing between sections 001, 002, or 003. If the number of distance locations (number of dial -in squares) exceeds the maximum number allowed, a second section will be designated for distance. All distance students must plan for on- site course delivery in Detroit for NUR 7030 Advanced Nursing Assessment. B. Admissions: Distance Learning students must agree to adhere to the distance policies prior to the start of each semester. Distance Learning Policies are available on the College of Nursing IT Canvas Si te and College of Nursing website. C. Canvas: In order to assist with posting, exams, and other distance issues, the Distance Learning Coordinator will be added to the Canvas site of every distance learning course. D. Maximum Class Size: The combined total number of students enrolled in a course that has distance sections will be determined by the Associate Dean, Faculty Affairs based upon teaching workload. The combined total includes students on campus, at the distance classroom site(s), and offsite. E. Total Number of Distance Students per program: At any given time and across cohorts, there will be no more than twenty (20) DNP distance students and fifty (50) MSN or Graduate Certificate program distance students. For the MSN and Graduate Certificate progra ms, the number per program will be determined by the MSN Specialty Coordinators, Graduate Certificate Program Coordinators, and Graduate Program Director. Graduate Coordinators will report the number of new admissions to the Distance Learning Coordinator, and the Distance Learning Coordinator will send an updated report to Program Directors every semester. 8 F. Synchronous Distance Learning Program: The College will continue to arrange for distance courses and classrooms as needed based upon all distance stude nts' plans of work. G. Attendance Requirements: Distance Students may be expected to come to campus a maximum of 3 times per course. Dates will be outlined in the course syllabus and available before the start of the semester II. Distance Learning Professiona l Responsibilities and Behaviors: A. Technical Requirements: To minimize technical issues, students and faculty must use the video conferencing technology that meets the technical requirements listed below: 1. Hardwire Capable Computer 2. Ethernet Cable 3. Webcam 4. Headset 5. High-Speed Internet Connection B. All users must perform a successful test connection with the College of Nursing IT Department. The user must schedule the test connection well in advance by calling 313 -577-8604. C. When troubleshooting issues, be patient with everyone. Most issues cannot be foreseen and working remotely has its challenges. D. Users must: 1. Abide by all rules set in place by the instructor in the syllabus. For example, if on campus students may not eat during class, distance students cannot do so either. 2. Keep the microphone and computer muted when not talking unless otherwise requested by faculty. Small noises tend to be amplified. 3. Set up the computer on a desk or a table in a room with minimal distractions. Small children, pets, ringing phones, and other noises are distracting for everyone. Behavior should be professional. Side conversations are not professional and is disruptive to the class. Focus on the class at hand and participate. Because of a sound lag common with video conferencing, this may require additional effort. 4. When online with the class, be cognizant of attire and what is reflected. 5. Be aware of lighting issues. Lighting distorts visibility. Bright lights shining in one direction can create glare. Front lighting is req uired. Window light and lighting behind the student needs to be blocked. E. If a student violates the policies listed above, the distance connection will be immediately disconnected. III. Examination Policy: A. Examinations: In order to maintain the integrity of the academic programs in the College of Nursing, all examinations within a course must be given using the same method. For example, if proctored paper and pencil tests are given to students on campus, all students at distance sites will also be given proctore d paper and pencil tests. If tests are proctored and given by Respondus on campus, all students at distance sites will be given examinations via Respondus Monitor and proctored by the Distance Learning Coordinator or faculty. All examinations designa ted as \"proctored exams\" must be proctored. College of Nursing proctored course examinations must be taken either on campus or at a proctored distance site. Offsite students must make arrangements with the Distance Learning Coordinator to take any proctored examination either on campus or at the nearest distance proctored site. If unwilling to travel to the nearest \" proctored exam site \", the student will be responsible for fees related to proctored exams. B. Accommodations for Exams 1. If a student has a documented disability that requires accommodations for examinations, longer time for examinations, etc.; the student will need to register with Student Disability Services for coordination of academic accommodations. The Student Disability Services (SDS) office is located at 1600 David Adamany Undergraduate Library in the 9 Student Academic Success Services department. SDS telephone numbers are 313-577- 1851 or 313-577-3365 (TDD only). 2. Distance students with disabilities must contact the Distance Learning Coordinator at 313-577-1363 to finalize arrangements. IV. Off-Site Qualifications and Exceptions: A. Off Site Qualifications: An offsite student is a student who attends the majority of classes from home instead of attending class in Detroit or at a distance site. In order to be considered a permanent offsite student, the student's official address must be a minimum of 60 miles from the closest classroom site. The Distance Learning Coordinator will assess the distance from the student's home address to the WSU main campus using an online distance calculator to ensure the minimum distance requirement is being met. If the distance requirement is met, the Distance Learning Coordinator notifies the Assistant Dean of Enrollment Management and Student Services of the student's status as a permanent offsite student. B. Exceptions to the Off-Site Qualification: a. Long Term Exception: An adm itted student may request a permanent off- site exception to the above qualifications. Decisions to grant a permanent off -site exception will be done on a case -by-case basis. Long term exceptions do not apply to NUR 7030 Advanced Physical Assessment as it is not offered as a distance course. Exceptions are granted using the following procedures: a. The student completes an exception form and submits it to the Distance Learning Coordinator. b. The Distance Learning Coordinator submits the exception request to the Associate Dean, Academic and Clinical Affairs. c. The final decision to grant an exception is determined by the Associate Dean, Academic and Clinical Affairs. d. The Associate Dean, Academic and Clinical Affairs notifies the Distance Learning Coordinator and the Assistant Dean of Enrollment Management and Student Services. b. Short Term Off- Site Exceptions: Any College of Nursing student can use the video conferencing technology for a short period of time (e.g. a few weeks or one semester) on an exception basis p rovided that the class is being held in a classroom with distance learning technology. The student will work with the Distance Learning Coordinator throughout the exception process. All questions can be directed to the Distance Learning Coordinator. If the student is requesting an exception for the entire semester, the student needs to submit the request prior to the override and registration process. If the exception is being done on an emergent basis mid -semester, it may take the Distance Learning Coordinator and IT staff up to 3 business days to get the student set -up. Short term exceptions are granted at the faculty member and Associate Dean of Academic and Clinical Affair's discretion using the following procedures: a. The student completes an excep tion form and submits it to the Distance Learning Coordinator and faculty of record for the course. b. The Distance Learning Coordinator submits the exception request to the Associate Dean of Academic and Clinical Affairs. c. The final decision to grant an exception is determined by the Associate Dean of Academic and Clinical Affairs after consultation with faculty of record. If the faculty of record and Associate Dean of Academic and Clinical Affairs denies the request, there is no additional recourse. d. The As sociate Dean, Academic and Clinical Affairs notifies the Distance Learning Coordinator. e. The Distance Learning Coordinator notifies the student College IT Department, and College Office of Student Affairs of the exception. f. IT staff work to get the student set-up with software and conducts a test connection. 10 (Approved by Administrative Council May 4, 2018) APRN Specialty Clinical Courses; Courses requiring a clinical permit Students must complete all APRN clinical hours in the state of Michigan (and limited placements in Toledo, Ohio for some specialties).

Changing Clinical Specialties. You should speak with your Academic advisor and discuss your intentions to switch clinical specialt ies. To change clinical specialties, you must meet both with the coordinator of the specialty in which you are currently enrolled and t he coordinator of the clinical specialty in which you believe you may way want to be enrolled and discuss your intentions to make a change . With your academic advisor, y ou then complete the Clinical Specialty Change form, acquire the necessary 16 signatures, and submit the form to the Director of Advanced Practice and Graduate Certificate Programs. Changes of specialty that occur du ring the clinical specialty courses will result in a one -year delay to the start of the new clinical specialty courses. The forms for change of the specialty can be found on the nursing website. Process for Clinical Placements Specialty Coordinators/Clinical Faculty or designated staff are responsible for all communications with preceptors and clinical sites for potential clinical placements. Students do not engage in arranging potential placements with preceptors or clinical sites. Student requests for potential placements may be discussed with the Specialty Coordinator, who will proceed with the placement arrangements. Any student with a potential placement at a Spectrum Health clinic/hospital must speak with the Specialty Coordinator by March in the year they will start the APRN clinical courses. There is a detailed process for application that must be followed. The Specialty Coordinator will communicate the names of students with potential academic year placements at Spectrum to the D irector of Advanced Practice and Graduate Certificate Program, who will work with the student to complete the required application paperwork. In most specialties, the student must be an employee of Spectrum Health to be eligible for a Spectrum Health clini cal placement. Failure to complete the application paperwork on time will lead to a delay in the semester the student will be allowed a clinical placement at Spectrum Health. Academic Program Planning A faculty advisor is appointed at the time of the applicant's acceptance into the program. The role of the faculty advisor is to guide and mentor the student through all the College and University requirements until the Master of Science in Nursing is obtained. Major responsibilities of the advis or include: Assisting the student in preparation of the Plan of Work (POW). The electronic copy of the plan of work should be available to the Office of Student Affairs before the student completes twelve graduate credits toward the degree requirement. Providing feedback to the student on his/her academic performance. Giving academic and personal encouragement to the student. Informing and Assisting the student in options for program prog ression Providing information to the student about University services and financial aid opportunities. Offering guidance to the student in applying for external and university fellowships. Being an academic role model for the student. 17 LE OF CONTENTS TABLE The following requirements are essential for all students involved in APRN clinical courses. Students in the NNP and PNP specialt ies must also have a clinic al permit for NUR 7030; Psych -Mental Health students for NUR 7605. The College of Nursing has contracts with each agency which require a Health Clearance, BCLS Certification, Liability Insurance, and a current RN licensure. Failure to comply with these requirements will result in exclusion from clinical experiences. After the documents are submitted to Castle Branch , the Office of Student Affairs (OSA) will provide Clinical Permits to the Director of Advanced Practice and Graduate Certificate Programs and copies will be provided to Specialty Coordinators and Course Coordinators prior to the start of the clinical courses. Health forms and renewal dates on all required documents must be updated just prior to submission of the forms on August 15 for fall semester, December 15 for winter semester, and April 15 for Spring/Summer semester. The Clinical Permit will be good for one semester. Note that if the Michigan license expires during the semester, the student must submit the renewal minimally two weeks prior to the expiration date or the Clinical Permit will be invalid. Students will receive a war ning email from OSA if the initial submission date is missed. Starting the following week (one week after the initial deadline), S tudents will incur a one -week penalty for start of clinicals . For each subsequent week the permit is not valid, additional one -week penalties will be added. Students will not be allowed to start clinicals until faculty and students receive a clearance and start date from the Director of Advanced Practice and Graduate Certificate Programs. Delays in start of clinical hours may result in delay in progression through the clinical courses. Student must follow the preceptor's schedule for clinicals and preceptors are not responsible for lack of sufficient time in the semester if a student was delayed in starting clinicals due to an invalid clinical permit. Students are not allowed to attend clinical without a valid Clinical Permit. If students attend clinical without a valid Clinical Permit, those clinical hours will not count towards the total number of hours required for the course and students may be subject to disciplinary action. Students with an incomplete grade in any course requiring a cl inical permit must have a valid clinical permit for each semester that they are working on finishing the incomplete. If the clinical permit is not valid , the student may not work on any of the requirements of the incomplete. Failure to adhere to this policy may result in disciplinary action. NOTE: Students assigned to Spectrum Health Clinical Sites Students with clinicals at Spectrum Health clinics/hospitals must also complete the requirements of the Spectrum Health Office of Medical Education (SHOME). The deadline for changes in plans of work involving a course that requires a clinical permit is one month prior to each semester's clinical permit deadline date. Requirements: Documentation of compliance with these requirements must be uploaded to CastleBranch -Immunization Tracker by the stated deadline. Students can access Immunization Tracker online at www.portal.castleb ranch.com/WL48 REQUIREMENTS FOR THE CLINICAL EXPERIENCE 18 Documentation of Clinical and Practicum Hours in Typhon. The CON MSN Program requires documentation of clinical/practicum hours and experiences via the Typhon Clinical Log, which is a web -accessed student tracking platform. Students must enter their clinical placement schedule prior to actual attendance, which can be done weekly, monthly, or by semester, depending on how far in advance clinical schedules are known. Student must also log in all patient encounters done under the aegis of Wa yne State University and also the time in/time out attendance hours for scheduled day, within 15 days of attending clinicals. Clinical specialties may require additional documentation, i.e., CPT codes, procedures, demographics and insurance data. GENERA L REQUIREMENTS ACEMAPP If attending an ACE site, s tudents must complete the requirements for ACE, the Alliance for the Clinical Experience. Requirements include successful completion of on- line classes and exams in HIPAA, OSHA, and BBP. Students must pass the exams within the two attempts or they may not be eligible to enter clinical courses (they may not be able to enter the program or progress in the program). Health Clearance The examination may be completed by the student's nurse practitioner or physician and the required form filled out and submitted. The TB skin test must be in effect for the entire semester /academic year . Vaccinations and/or evidence of immunity are require d for Tdap, measles, mumps, rubella, varicella, Hepatitis B and influenza.

Original dated certification documents must cover the entire academic/clinical year and must be resubmitted when they expire. Flu Vaccine Flu Vaccine In order to meet the requirement of clinical agencies, the student must submit documentation for the flu vaccine by October 15. If these documents are not submitted, the Clinical Permit will be rescinded and the student will be excluded from clinical experiences. Professional Liability Insurance Wayne State University College of Nursing will provide professional liability insurance through Nursing Practice Corporation, at a cost of approximately $ 10.29 per student. Students must submit this fee online and the link is found on nursing.wayne.edu . (Nurse -Midwife students are required to purchase an individual student policy.) The policy is valid August 15 - August 14 and is not prorated. Medical Declination Forms Students who are unable to clinical health requirements due to medical conditions are required to submit the College of Nursing declination form along supporting documentation from a health care provider. Please contact your Academic Services Officer for a copy of the declination form. Students should submit the declination form to their Academic Services Officer who will forward it to the Associate Dean of Academic and Clinical Affairs to decide if the waiver is appropriate. Students who do not meet the cl inical permit requirements may be prevented from attending clinical courses. 19 Maintaining Licensure The student must show proof of being a currently licensed RN in the United States when admitted to the program [See admission requirements for non- domestic students) . Out -of-state domestic students have two semesters to submit a Michigan RN licensure ; international students have two semesters to pass the NCLEX exam and submit a Michigan RN license. If a student fa ils to submit a Michigan RN license by the end of two semesters , the student cannot progress in the program until the license is submitted. The student must maintain current licensure for the duration of the program. Should the license expire or be revoked for any reason, it is the student's responsibility to report this to the Office of Student Affairs. The student may not continue in the program until current licensure is restored. If licensure was revoked and reinstated, the student must report any condi tions attached for future practice. Submission of the renewed Michigan RN license is due two weeks prior to the expiration date posted on your license. Criminal Background Investigation According to Public Health Code Section 20173 and Section 21173(1), any individual who regularly provides direct services to patients and residents in nursing homes, county medical facilities, homes for the aged and adult foster care cannot be granted clinical privileges if they have been convicted of one or more of the following: a. A felony or an attempt or conspiracy to commit a felony within the 15 years preceding the date of application. b. A misdemeanor involving abuse, neglect, assault, battery, or criminal sexual conduct or involving fraud or theft against a vulne rable adult defin ed in the Michigan penal code, 1931 PA 328, MCL 750.145m, or a state or federal crime that is substantially similar to a Misdemeanor described in this subdivision within 10 years immediately preceding the date of application. This legislation as well as regulatory agency requirements mandates that students have a criminal history check conducted in order to gain clinical privileges at the various agencies used during the course of the student's education. Exclusion from a clinical site could jeopardize successful completion of the program. Students must have a criminal background check performed by Castlebranch .com. Urine Drug Screen Testing In addition to the c riminal background i nvestigation, many health care agencies require results of a urine drug screen test (negative result) prior to the beginning of your clinical experience. This should be obtained at the Wayne State University Campus Health Center. MSN and DNP students who are Distance Learn ers can use a local faculty. The screen must include the following drugs: use of medical marijuana will provide a positive result on a urine drug screen. Students with a Medical Marijuana Registry Identification Card will be required to submit a valid copy to the Office of Student Affairs. Wayne State College of Nursing's clinical partners may exclude a student with a positive drug screen from attending clinical courses at their site, which could jeopardize the successful completion of the program. Results of the Urine Drug Screen test must be submitted to OSA and will become part of your health information file. Health Insurance Though not required, it is highly recommended by the College that each student also have personal health insurance coverage in addition to the required liability insurance. Students may choose to purchase an injury and sickness insurance plan for a reasona ble fee. The policy provides stipulated amounts for outpatient prescription drugs (sickness only), hospitalization, surgery and emergency room 20 fees, alcoholism and drug abuse treatment, and psychotherapy benefits. Forms to purchase this insurance are avail able by contacting the Health Insurance Advocate in the Office of International Students and Scholars: 313 -577-0724. CLINICAL ATTIRE Uniform Approved nursing attire must be worn during the clinical placement. L ab coats must be ordered through the university Barnes & Noble bookstore if required by the specialty. Within the healthcare agency, the student is expected to present a clean, well -groomed appearance. The student represents not only him/herself but the College of Nursing and the nursing profession. Students are expected to use good judgment regarding their professional attire, especially when in Community Health Agencies or as students in \"management\" settings. Body Odor Students in the academic and clinical setting will be free of offensive body odor secondary to personal hygiene, strong perfumes, colognes, lotions, aftershaves, or the smell of cigarettes. Clean clinical attire that is free of odor is required for all students in all clinical rotations. ID Badge All nursing students are required to obtain a Wayne State University One Card. Students wear their OneCard while at their clinical site. OneCards can be obtained from the university OneCard office, located on the second floor of the Welcome Center.

The expectation in 7030 is that each student will have a rudimentary knowledge of the basic assessment skills, which includes the ability to demonstrate basic skills and understand the rationale for the assessment skill. The written exam is based on the undergraduate nursing assessment course. It is a multiple- choice exam with 50 randomized questions using Respondus and it is open book. The written exam covers questi ons related to basic physical assessment techniques and content. The physical exam demonstration covers basic physical assessment skills. Each student will have three attempts to pass the written exam with a score of 75% or better. The exam will be open f or seven hours during each attempt at the exam. The examination will be available on Canvas under the NUR 7030 PreTest tab and students will be informed of the \"go live\" date during the Winter semester before they take NUR 7030. After you have passed the written exam, you may contact Mrs. Christine Seaver (ef8107@wayne.edu) to sign up for ONE (1) time slot for the demonstration exam of your physical assessment skills. The schedule is available on Canvas under t he Skills Demonstration Schedule tab. No cancellations are accepted. Students cannot cancel and request a new sign- up date. All students except the neonatal students will demonstrate an adult/adolescent basic physical examination using the rubric provided on Canvas . Neonatal students have a separate physical exam pre- assessment rubric. The Rubrics for the pre -assessmen t will be posted on the website. Use the rubric to practice for this portion of the pre - assessment , but you may not use the rubric during your scheduled physical exam demonstration. All students must pass the complete exam with the majority of the skills ( 90 %) demonstrated to our clinical skills lab staff. The areas that the faculty believe you may need to review or remediate will be identified. These areas are the sections you should read about and review before starting NUR 7030. Distance students who live 6 0 miles or more from campus can demonstrate a physical examination from a remote location or they can demonstrate the exam on campus. Students are provided a systematic process for demonstrating the exam from a remote location. T he Distance Learning Coordinator will work with each student to facilitate the process. For all students, once both assessment processes are completed, you may receive an over -ride to register for NUR 7030. In summary, the pre -assessment process is as follows: 1. Take and pass the written exam with a score of 75% 2. Schedule a time to demonstrate a Basic Physical Assessment 3. Demonstrate a Physical Assessment in front of a clinical lab staff and pass the exam; 4. Contact your ASO to receive your override for NUR 7030 for the Spring Summer semester. NUR 7030 PRETEST PROCESS 23 OF CONTENTS TABLE Enrolled students experiencing an injury or non -personal illness (excludes personal illnesses such as, but not limited to, flu, cold/sinus, etc.) on campus or while attending class or participating in University - sponsored activities shall receive initial treatment at a University -authorized medical facility as noted below: Emergency issues: DMC - Detroit Receiving Hospital - ER 4201 St. Antoine St, Detroit, MI 48201 (313) 745- 3000 Henry Ford Hospital System - Main Campus - ER 2799 West Grand Blvd, Detroit, MI 48202 (313) 916- 2600 Non- emergency Issues*: University Health MI 48201 (313) 745- 4522 Hours of Operation: 7 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Monday thru Friday Henry Ford Medical Center - Harbortown 3370 E Jefferson Ave, Detroit, MI 48207 (313) 656- 1600 Only the initial treatment necessary for an injury or illness requiring immediate attention is covered by this policy.

If the student receives an invoice for initial service, student shall forward the invoice to the Office of Risk Management for payment review. For services/treatment beyond the initial visit, the student shall either self -pay directly to the provider or forward the invoice to the personal health insurance carrier STUDENT INJURY POLICY 24 It is important to note that only the initial treatment for the actual injury is covered by the University. Any diagnostic testing, prescriptions or subsequent visits are the responsibility of the student. (*) Walk -ins should be no later than 3:00 p.m. for both clinics Bloodborne Pathogen Exposure Plan All students should use extreme caution in the care of their patients to avoid needle sticks and exposure to Bloodborne pathogens. All students will use Universal Precaution in all patient care settings. In the event of a needle stick or exposure to bloodborne pathogens: Students who are possibly exposed to bloodborne pathogens by way of needle sticks or exposure to human body fluids must report the exposure to their clinical instructor immediately . They should w ash off or flush out exposure as soon as possible after it occurs according the guidelines provided by the ACE modules or the clinical agency.\" 1. Exposure during a precepted experience must be reported immediately to the preceptor and as soon as possible to the course faculty member. 2. For students who are possibly exposed to bloodborne pathogens by way of needle sticks or exposure to human body fluids at off- campus sites, such as hospitals or community health settings, the following policy will apply o For exposures in a hospital or another agency with a policy covering possible exposure to bloodborne pathogens, the policy of the facility will be followed. o For exposures in a setting where there is no policy on possible exposure to bloodborne pathogens, the student should either report immediately to University Health Center (UHC), 4K (7:30 a.m. - 3:30 p.m.*) or Henry Ford Health Center -Harbortown Suite 100 (8:00a.m. -4:30p.m.*) located on Jefferson just west of Belle Isle or to their personal health care provider (at your own expense). If the injury occurs after the previously mentioned clinic's operational hour, the student has the option to go to Detroit Receiving or Henry Ford Emergency Room for initial treatment. If the agency does not cover the cost of testing for students, students are responsible for the cost of testing beyond the initial treatment for exposure (health insurance may cover): HIV antibody Hepatitis B surface antibody Hepatitis C antibody Testing for Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers (e.g. Ebola and Marburg fevers) Pregnancy test (for women) 25 OF CONTENTS E Skill Laboratory (Rooms 217 & 219 Cohn) The Skill laboratory is a practice lab with simulated hospital bedside units. Students practice various nursing procedures under the guidance of a nursing faculty. Physical Assessment Learning Laboratory (Room 30 Cohn) The Physical Ass essment Learning La boratory (PA L) provides materials, activities, and facilities for students to acquire skills in history -taking and physical assessment and is located on the lower level of the Cohn Building. It is equipped with study carrels and physical examination rooms. Students learn physical examination skills through the use of demonstration, media viewing, and practice. Office of Health Research (Room 315 Cohn) The Office of Health Research ( OHR), the research arm of the College of Nursing, embodies the commitment of faculty to research. The idea of a center originated with faculty in the mid -60: it became a reality in 1969. It was the first such center in an academic setting devoted to the generation of new knowledge which underpins the discipline and profession of nursing. The research program of the Office of Health Research ( OHR) focuses on nursing and health- related research, including interdisciplinary research, for the purpose of advancing nursing knowledge and improving nursing and health, particularly Urban Health. Because the research objectives also target health needs of the urban community, the research agenda also advances the research programs of the University. Visit the website to learn more about the O HR at http://www.nursing.wayne.edu/research /index.htm. Simulation Laboratory ( Room 221 Cohn) The Simulation L aboratory contains state -of -the art technology (including high fidelity mannequin simulators and audio -visual real- time capture) to provide the student with an immersive and interactive environment which enhances student learning. Students, in conjunction with faculty, are able to practice and blend skills taught in the Nursing Skills Laboratory, Physical Assessment Learning Laboratory and the classroom. Because of the immersive nature of th e simulation environment, students are required to behave in a professional manner and wear approved Wayne State University clinical uniforms when in the Simulation Laboratory. RESOURCES 26 CONTENTS E Since education is a cooperative effort between teacher and student, both parties must fulfill obligations if the integrity and efficacy of the instructional process are to be preserved. Professional Integrity Policy Breaches of academic and professional integrity are grave and serious acts. The faculty member and/or student are expected to take action when any breach of integrity occurs. Inherent in the beliefs of WSU is that the University must prepare young men and women in such a way that they will have the intellectual an d moral strengths to make value judgments and to assume participant roles in responding to the needs of a rapidly changing, complex society. Honesty is a value of society and the nursing profession, and students are expected to respect this principle. The nursing student has areas of responsibility as stated in the Student Handbook and the College of Nursing philosophy. As the student strives to become a professional nurse, she/he must actively support the ethics and goals of the profession. The faculty as members of the nursing profession must actively support the goals and ethics. The nursing student and faculty member, therefore, have the responsibility to act in an honest and truthful manner and to protect the integrity of scholarship and to take action when there is any violation of academic integrity. Violation of academic and/or professional integrity shall result in a failing grade on a particular assignment or test, a failing grade for a course, or exclusion from the College of Nursing, depending on the nature of the particular incident. Final decision will be determined through collaboration of faculty, Associate Dean , Associate Dean for Academic Affairs, and Dean.

When such a discussion fails to resolve the problem, the college's published procedures should be followed. Although the University Ombudsperson is not a direct part of the appeal process, students and faculty may consult the Ombudsperson at any point during such proceedings. University Guidelines for Assisting Persons with Behavioral Problems All members of the Univer sity community are expected to conduct themselves in a manner which is conducive to an environment that encourages the free exchange of ideas and information. However, from time to time, the University is called upon to assist individuals who are displayin g behavior which: 1. Threatens themselves or others; and/ or that 2. Severely impairs their ability to function within the University environment; and/or that 3. Makes impossible the proper functioning of an academic program through obstructive or disruptive behavior. 28 To ensure respect for the legal rights of every person, the University seeks, through referral or intervention, to guarantee that appropriate professional care is available for those who become disruptive. 29BASIC PRINCIPLES 1. Assistance | Student/faculty may contact the College of Nursing, Assistant Dean, Enrollment and Student Services and/or the Wayne State University Ombudsperson at any time for assistance with any problem associated with a grade decision or grade appeal. 2. Timeliness of Appeals Process | Failure of the instructor or any appeal officer to respond within the designated time frame of the formal appeal entitles the student to proceed to the next level of appeal. In no case should there be any assumption that a failure to respond at any level signifies a granting of the appeal. Failure of the student to adhere to the time -frames specified in the policy will result in the appeal process being nullified (the appeal will not be heard). 3. Process | All steps of the formal grade appeal must be done in written format; no email correspondence is acceptable. Information submitted should be time stamped and dated as it is received. 4. Academic Dishonesty | These policy guidelines do not apply to allegations of academic dishonesty. Academic dishonesty matters are addressed under the Student Code of Conduct. 5. Patient safety | Students may be removed from a clinical course at any time in which the faculty or clinical agency staff identifies an issue that would constitute unsafe practice in the clinical setting that may jeopardize patient safety. Note that \"days\" are counted as Monday through Friday, excluding University holidays. APPEAL OF GRADE What Can be Appealed Only the manner in which the grade was assigned can be appea led. Instructors are expected to evaluate student work according to sound academic standards. It is the instructor's prerogative to assign grades in accordance with his/her academic/professional judgment. If the student believes the manner in which the grade was assigned was done in an unfair manner and the student is able to demonstrate that the unfair manner is based on one of the three criteria stated below, then the student may file an appeal pursuant to the process set forth below. The student assumes the burden of proof in the appeals process. Grounds for appeals are: (1) the application of non- academic criteria in the grading process, as listed in the university 's non- discrimination/affirmative action statute: race, color, sex (including gender identity), national origin, religion, age, sexual orientation, familial status, marital status, height, weight, disability, or veteran status; (2) sexual harassment or discrimination; or (3) evaluation of student work by criteria not directly reflective of performance relative to course requirements. Grade Appeal Process COLLEGE OF NURSING ACADEMIC APPEALS POLICY - GRADES AND EXLUSIONS 30 Prior to implementing the formal appeal process, the student must discuss in person the disputed grade with the instructor of the course within ten days of notification of the grade. The faculty member will respond in writing with a copy to the student and the Assistant Dean, Enrollment and Student Services. If the dispute remains unresolved, the student may then initiate a formal appeal. All steps of the appeal process must be followed within the stated time frame or the appeal process is nullified (will not be heard). Steps to Initiate a Formal Appeal 1. The student must submit a written statement detailing his or her objections to the faculty response, along with supporting documentation, to the Associate Dean of Faculty Affairs with copy to the Assistant Dean for Enrollment and Student Services. This statement must be submitted within 14 days following the response of the faculty member who assi gned the grade. 2. The Ass ociate Dean of Faculty Affairs must meet with the student and faculty member, either jointly or individually, within 14 days of receiving the appeal to attempt to resolve the issue. 3. The student must be notified in writing of the A ssociate Dean of Faculty Affairs' decision within 21 days of receiving the student's written appeal. As the Dean's designee, the decision of the Ass ociate Dean of Faculty Affairs shall be the final decision at the College level. 4. Provost Review. If, after your School/College appeal path is exhausted and you wish to continue with the grade appeal process, per the University Academic policy, you may request a Provost Review within 30 days of this decision. The request should be submitted via the online form located at https://provost.wayne.edu/academic - policy . For assistance with the appeal process, you may contact the Ombudsperson Laura Birnie -Lindemann at ombudsoffice@wayne.edu . Pursuant to University policy, the Provost's decision in an academic appeal is final. APPEAL OF EXCLUSION FOR UNSAFE OR UNPROF ESSIONAL BEHAVIOR Basic Principles Students are required to demonstrate patterns of professional behaviors which follow the legal and ethical codes of nursing; promote the actual or potential well -being of clients, health care workers, and self in the biological, psychological, sociological and cultural realms; demonstrate accountability in preparation, documentation, communication and continuity of care; and show respect for human rights of individuals. The following indicators are to be used as guidelines for evaluating safe or professional practice: 1. Biological, Psychological, Social and C ultural Realms The student's practice meets the needs of the client from a biological, psychological, sociological and cultural standpoint. 31 Examples of unsafe practice include, but are not limited to, the following: Displays of mental, physical or emotional behavior(s) which may negatively affect others' well being Failure to follow through on suggested referrals or interventions to correct deficit areas, which may result in harm to others Acts of omission or commission in the ca re of clients/patients, such as: o Physical abuse o Placing the client in hazardous positions, conditions or circumstances o Mental or emotional abuse o Medication errors that demonstrate a pattern of incorrectly preparing/administering medications and/or failure to follow through with direction/remediation regarding medication administration o Failure to accurately record comprehensive client behaviors o Attempting activities without adequate orientation or theoretical preparation or appropriate assistance o Presenting for clinical practicum under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol (It is expected that students in laboratory settings will not have used alcohol for at least eight (8) hours prior to the beginning of the clinical time period, nor to use alcohol during the clinical period. At no time is the use of illicit drugs condoned). o Engaging in criminal behavior Interpersonal relationships with agency staff, co -workers, peers, or faculty that results in miscommunications, disruption of client care and/or unit functi oning; Inability to perform psychomotor skills necessary for carrying out procedures despite direction/remediation. 2. Accountability The student's behavior should consistently demonstrate accountability and professionalism throughout the clinical practicum experience. Examples of unprofessional practice include, but are not limited to the following: Failure to notify the agency and/or instructor of clinical absence Failure to adhere to the dress code Habitual tardiness to clinical assignments Failure to fo llow through or successfully meet identified learning goals as outlined in a process improvement plan Failure to provide concise, inclusive, written and verbal communication 3. Dishonesty Examples of dishonesty include but are not limited to the following: Plagiarism False reporting or misrepresentation of data related to client, self, others Failure to report errors/mistakes or any event(s) that would affect clients or others welfare. 4.

Examples of regulatory violations include but are not limited to the following: Violations of patient privacy (HIPAA) Participating in skills or behaviors that are outside of the nursing scope of practice while in the clinical agency. Violation of clinical permit requirements. 5. Ethical The student practices according to the American Nurses Association Code of Ethics and the Standards of Practice. Examples of unethical practice include, but are no t limited to the following: Refusal of assignment based on client's race, culture, sexual orientation, or religious preference Failure to maintain confidentiality Misrepresentation of information to the public Ignoring unethical behavior(s) of other health care persons in the clinical setting which affects client welfare. Procedure for Unsafe Behaviors in the Clinical Setting 1. When a clinical preceptor makes the determination that a student in the clinical setting has displayed behavior that poses a safety risk to the student, patient, staff, faculty or fellow students, the student shall immediately be relieved of patient care responsibilities. The preceptor and the student must contact the clinical faculty and report this incident. The student will be dismissed from the clinical site. The student will be told that a determination of a corrective course of action will be arrived at after consultation with the preceptor, clinical faculty, and course coordinator. T he student will not be able to return to clini cal until resolution. 2. Within 24 hours, the preceptor and clinical faculty will write up the incident detailing the clinical events that transpired leading up to the removal of the student from patient care and the clinical site . 3. The clinical faculty will notify the course coordinator within 24 hours of the incident. The course coordinator will immediately notify the Ass ociate Dean of Faculty Affairs and the Assistant Dean, Enrollment and Student Services via email. 4. The course coordinator, in collaboratio n with the clinical faculty and Ass ociate Dean (if necessary), will determine a corrective course of action . This may include a Performance Improvement Plan, supervised skill review on campus, written work, and/or an evaluation of student performance by a third party, e.g. the course coordinator or the course coordinator's designee. Corrective course of action may include exclusion from the program. 33 5. A meeting will be held which includes the student, the Assistant Dean of Enrollment and Student Services or designee and, at a minimum, the clinical faculty, the course coordinator, and the Associate Dean or designee. The student will be given advance notice of the time and place of this meeting and will be allowed to have an advisor or support person with him/h er. At this meeting, a written summary of the observed clinical behavior as well as the plan for corrective action including time frames for completion will be presented to the student for discussion and signature. The meeting will occur within three business days of the notification of the course coordinator. If the student fails to appear without extenuating circumstances, he or she will be excluded from the program and notified of exclusion by registered mail. Official exclusion (if this is the decision ) occurs at this point. 6. If it is determined that the student is excluded from the program, the student is advised to contact the Assistant Dean, Enrollment and Student Services, or designee to learn about the Appeal Policy. Appeal Process for Exclusion for Unsafe Practice in the Clinical Setting A student may appeal his/her exclusion from the program for unsafe practice by following the guidelines for appeal identified below. Steps to Initiate a Formal Appeal: 1. A written appeal outlining the student's view point of the circumstances which caused the student's removal from the clinical course and the rationale for the appeal must be submitted within five business days of the exclusion to the Assistant Dean, Enrollment and Student Services. Appeals submi tted after the deadline will not be heard. 2. Within one business day of the receipt of an appeal, the As sociate Dean of Faculty Affairs and the Associate Dean for Academic and Clinical Affairs (serving as the Dean's designee) will review the documentation p rovided by the instructor and the student and make a decision, which is final. The decision will be forwarded to the Assistant Dean, Enrollment and Student Services, who will notify the student. 3. If the appeal is sustained and the student is allowed to ret urn to the clinical setting, arrangements will be made for the student to make up missed time. Any absences sustained during this time will not fall under the clinical absenteeism policy. 4. If the appeal is denied, the exclusion from the clinical setting will result in an F grade for the course. 5. Provost Appeal. The student may request the Provost to review the final decision on the record. A written Request for a Provost Review must be made by the student himself/herself, with a copy to the Dean of the College of Nursing, postmarked within thirty (30) calendar days of the postmark of the College's final decision. The Provost's review of the College's decision will proceed as soon as practicable after notification by the student of his/her wish to seek r eview. 34 6. If, after your School/College appeal path is exhausted and you wish to continue with the grade appeal process, per the University Academic policy, you may request a Provost Review within 30 days of this decision. The request should be submitted via the online form located at https://provost.wayne.edu/academic-policy .
