There are many aromatherapy essential oils that can reduce stress and tension, boost your focus and concentration, deepen your breathing, and help eliminate negative thoughts. We have found ten essential oils that you can use individually or in a blend to make your meditation time more effective and enjoyable. How To Use Oils For Meditation There are two main ways to use essential oils in your meditation. The first is by diffusing it in the air.

The second method is to rub diluted essential oils into your skin. Be aware that essential oils are extremely volatile, and will need to be diluted with something like skin cream, carrier oil, or water, in order to be used safely. If you're using a new oil, try a tiny test spot on your skin with the diluted oil. If your skin has a reaction, you should see it in 45 minutes.
