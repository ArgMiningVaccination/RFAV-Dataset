The following observations have been made by our staff. Biological Effects of Crystal Meth Crystal Meth can become very addicting. Crystal Meth affects dopamine levels in the brain, causing a flood of the neurotransmitter that disrupts normal functioning. Dopamine is not only responsible for feeling pleasure, but also for motivation, movement, memory functions, learning, and reward processing. When you take Crystal Meth more often you will create a bigger tolerance to the substance, just like any other substance. Which will then require you to take more to make you feel a state of \"normal\". A meth user is at higher risk for HIV/AIDS. The drug can affect judgment and lessen inhibitions. Someone under the influence of the drug may be more likely to engage in risky behaviours, such as unsafe sex. Mental Effects and Spiritual Effects of Crystal Meth use Mental effects from using crystal meth can vary. First of all, it can cause a user to feel anxious and confused, unable to sleep and to have mood swings, that can then result in someone becoming violent. A user also may start to see things that are actually not there, then resulting in someone injuring themselves or others. Crystal Meth Detox - How does one detox from Crystal Meth Use There are multiple stages of detoxing from Crystal Meth. First, someone will experience a \"crash\" when they stop using the substance. At this stage, they may experience excessive amounts of sleep, a large appetite, irritability, anxiousness, and dysphoria. Withdrawl from the substance begins in the acute stage, which peaks 2-3 days after someone last used meth and lasts about 7-10 days in total. Some of the many symptoms may be things such as psychosis, mood swings, depression, aches and pains and insomnia. After the acute phase comes extinction. In this phase, mood swings, agitation, cravings, and trouble sleeping may continue for another couple of weeks, but depression can last anywhere from multiple weeks, months, or years.
