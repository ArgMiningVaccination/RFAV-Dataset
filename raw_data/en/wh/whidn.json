Meditation: The Multifaceted Powers of Mindfulness and Compassion Practices Talk: The Multifaceted Powers of Mindfulness and Compassion Practices Dna offering: These teachings are offered freely, at no charge. To practice generosity through making an offering - called \"dna\" in the language of early Buddhism - please enter your email and donation amount below. Once you click \"Donate\" you will be directed to PayPal, where you can pay via credit card (no PayPal account required) or your PayPal account. \"*\" indicates required fields Generosity itself is a beautiful practice that opens and gladdens the heart, relaxes the contraction of \"self,\" and ripples out into the world to touch many people - and perhaps, eventually, even oneself. Additionally, many expressions of generosity are not about money. People offer attention, encouragement, and patience many times a day. Sometimes we withhold when it would be so easy, actually, to listen quietly for another minute or to offer a word of appreciation or simply a look that says, \"I'm with you.\" Try being a little more generous for a day and see what happens.
