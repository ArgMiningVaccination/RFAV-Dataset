Before you know it, an episode of \"Selling Sunset\" has flown by and your plate is empty\u2014but you feel like you haven't tasted one bite. While this is a common human experience that certainly constitutes self-care every once in a while, mindful eating can help you find deeper pleasure when you want to enjoy every last bite. If you're ready for 101 on mindful eating, below, dietitian [Rachael Hartley, RD, LD](https://www.rachaelhartleynutrition.com/my-story), certified intuitive eating counselor and author of \" [Gentle Nutrition](https://www.amazon.com/Gentle-Nutrition-Non-Diet-Approach-Healthy/dp/1628604247),\" explained what you need to know. From the benefits of mindful eating to why it's different from intuitive eating, here's the TL;DR on bringing your mindfulness practice to the dinner table. RELATED: [The Ultimate Anxiety Toolkit: What Is Anxiety and How Can I Treat It?](https://blog.calm.com/blog/ultimate-anxiety-guide-toolkit) What is mindful eating, anyway? \"Mindful eating is eating with the intention of paying attention,\" Hartley explained. \"It's not just bringing awareness to the sensory experience of eating, like the taste, smells, and textures of food, but also noticing thoughts and bodily experiences, like hunger and fullness levels.\" As its name suggests, mindful eating stems from mindfulness\u2014 [a practice that involves](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/topic/mindfulness/definition) checking in with your thoughts, feelings, environment, and body throughout the day in a gentle, non-judgmental way. This attention-based practice originates from Hindu and Buddhist cultures and [dates back thousands of years](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3679190/) (and you've probably heard it mentioned a time or two on the Calm app). The most important thing to remember about mindful eating is this: It's about being kind and attentive to yourself. \"Mindful eating is a non-judgmental practice, so while these thoughts, feelings and senses are noticed, they are not judged,\" Hartley said. What isn't mindful eating? Mindful eating is not a punishment, and it's not a diet. Like meditation, it's simply a practice of paying attention. \"Try not to judge what comes up for you when trying to eat mindfully,\" Hartley suggested. \"Mindful eating is about nonjudgmental awareness. Instead, cultivate curiosity over what arises.\" What is the difference between mindful eating and intuitive eating? Mindful eating and intuitive eating often get confused, and although the two are compatible, they're not the same thing. \"Mindful eating and intuitive eating are two separate, but related eating interventions,\" explained Hartley. Intuitive eating is a framework founded by registered dietitians [Evelyn Tribole, RDN, and Elyse Resch, RDN](http://www.intuitiveeating.org/about-us/), in 1995 to help people cultivate a kinder relationship with food. \"It involves 10 principles which address everything from body image to interoceptive awareness to movement and nutrition,\" Hartley added. By contrast, mindful eating can be used by anyone, whether they're following intuitive eating principles or not. That said, if you find yourself curious about mindful eating, getting to know the intuitive eating principles may help you expand your mindfulness practice beyond mealtime. That way, you can adopt a positive, attentive relationship with your body even once the dishes are clean and you're onto the next part of your day. What are the benefits of eating mindfully? 1. Mindful eating may help reduce symptoms of I.B.S. \"Mindfulness techniques, including mindful eating, can be helpful in reducing symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (I.B.S.),\" says Hartley. I.B.S. is a common G.I. disorder that causes numerous uncomfortable symptoms, including excessive gas, abdominal pain, and cramps. According to one review of psychological interventions, a broader mindfulness practice can help folks with I.B.S. [notice and accept their discomfort](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5288603/) instead of experiencing psychological distress when symptoms arise. So while it's certainly not a be-all, end-all approach to I.B.S., it may be helpful for some. 2. Mindful eating may help treat eating disorders. While the therapeutic effects of mindful eating haven't been broadly studied on people with eating disorders, one study suggests that the practice may help with binge-eating disorder in particular. The research, published in \"The Journal of Treatment & Prevention,\" surveyed 30 [women struggling with binge eating disorder](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22703573/) before and after following a Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) approach. The 16 participants who completed the program reported that their mindfulness practice improved their self-awareness and food behaviors. Again, it's worth noting that this topic needs to be studied more thoroughly. 3. Mindful eating nurtures a better relationship with food. \"While pleasure is an overlooked facet of healthy eating, I believe it is extremely important, and mindful eating can help [make eating a more pleasurable experience](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/mindful-eating/),\" Hartley said. Sometimes, the simple act of paying attention to what's on the end of your fork can add a bright spot to your day or make you feel more connected with the moment\u2014and there's something to be said for that, too. How do I practice mindful eating? Unlike diet culture, which is fraught with rules and shame, mindful eating champions self-compassion and enjoyment. Essentially, it allows for life to happen. The reality is, sometimes, you have to eat at your desk or grab a quick bite while your kids are screaming in the background. \"For some people, practicing mindful eating might involve turning off all distractions, sitting down to a meal in silence and quietly savoring each bite of food, concentrating on the tastes and smells. For others, mindful eating might involve taking a deep breath before eating and taking a few bites throughout the meal where you really slow down and notice the tastes and textures,\" Hartley explained. \"There's no right or wrong way to eat mindfully,\" she added. \"The key is that you are intending to eat with greater awareness.\" The [Calm app](https://app.www.calm.com/) offers guided meditations, mindfulness programs, breathing exercises, and bedtime stories that can help you unwind. Feel better, inside and out. "}
