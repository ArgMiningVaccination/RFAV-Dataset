Our goal is to do what we can to make patients as comfortable as possible. In conjunction with Mayo Clinic's Complementary and Integrative Medicine Program, these programs strive to enrich the patient experience and enhance healing while at Mayo Clinic. Enhance social interaction and provide companionship and comfort to hospitalized patients with specially trained and registered dogs. Volunteers must have their own registered therapy dog. Provide patients, caregivers and nursing staff a gentle, relaxing, nontherapeutic hand massage. Volunteers receive specific hand massage training. Perform reiki or healing touch for patients at both Mayo Clinic Hospital \u2014 Rochester campuses and some outpatient areas in partnership with the Complementary and Integrative Medicine Program.
