{"title": "Plenary: Novel Cellular Therapy for Heme Malignancies: CAR T & Beyond", "author": "Todd A Fehniger", "url": "https://tandem.confex.com/tandem/2023/meetingapp.cgi/Session/7103", "hostname": "confex.com", "description": "Autologous CAR T cells have revolutionized the approach to treating patients with relapsed/refractory B cell malignancies. However, challenges exist for current CAR T cell therapies including treatment failure, adverse events (CRS/ICANS/cytopenias), cost, time to manufacture, and restricted targeting antigens. New approaches are being developed for hematologic malignancies to address these challenges and broaden the potential impact of cellular therapy for hematologic malignancies. These include alternative effector cells, new CAR design strategies, and alternative targeting approaches such as transgenic TCRs. In this session, Dr. Fehniger will discuss natural killer (NK) cells as a next-generation cellular therapy platform, Dr. Maus will review innovative approaches to CAR T cells, and Dr. Chapuis will present recent advances in targeting immune effectors via TCR engineering. All of these exciting cutting-edge cellular therapy advances will be presented with a focus on novel treatments for hematologic malignancies.", "sitename": "Tandem Meetings - 2023 Tandem Meetings | Transplantation & Cellular Therapy Meetings of ASTCT and CIBMTR", "date": "2023-02-18", "cleaned_text": "Welcome to the 2023 Tandem Meetings | Transplantation & Cellular Therapy Meetings of ASTCT and CIBMTR... please wait while the program loads.
