It's the ultimate housekeeping for your body hotel, a gentle yet effective way to get rid of toxins and impurities, and bring balance to the body. Ayurveda, the ancient Indian system of medicine, has been around for over 5,000 years and it's based on the principle that our health depends on the balance of three doshas, or energies, in our body: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. When these doshas are balanced, we feel great. When they're out of whack, we feel not-so-great.

Toxins can come from a variety of sources such as the food we eat, the air we breathe and even the products we put on our skin. These toxins can build up over time and cause a host of problems such as fatigue, weight gain, and even chronic illnesses. Ayurveda recognizes three basic body types, or doshas, namely Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each dosha is associated with certain characteristics, and the toxins present in the body will depend on the dominant dosha. Each dosha is associated with certain characteristics, and the toxins present in the body will depend on the DOMINANT dosha.

The primary goal of Ayurvedic Detox is to remove impurities and toxins from the body, allowing it to function at its best. The process involves the use of a variety of techniques. The beauty of Ayurvedic Detox is that it's tailored to each individual's unique needs, taking into account their specific dosha type. Herbal Supplements During Ayurvedic Detox: - Triphala, Guggulu, and Shankhapushpi are some of the most commonly used herbs in Ayurvedic Detox. - These herbs have been used for centuries to cleanse the body and support its natural detoxification processes. - They are known to boost digestion, support liver function, and remove toxins from the body. Diet Changes During Ayurvedic Detox: - During the detox process, it's essential to avoid foods that are hard to digest, such as processed foods and heavy meats. - Instead, focus on eating fresh, whole foods that are easy to digest and packed with nutrients. - This includes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes. - Ayurveda also recommends avoiding certain foods based on your specific dosha type. - And remember, a healthy diet is the foundation of a healthy body. So, don't be afraid to indulge in your favourite foods once in a while, just don't make it a daily habit. The secret ingredients to a successful Ayurvedic Detox: a pinch of Triphala, a dash of Guggulu, a spoonful of Shankhapushpi and a healthy dose of fruits, veggies, and whole grains. And don't forget, just like a good recipe, it's important to tailor the ingredients to your unique needs. And remember, a healthy diet is the foundation of a healthy body. Shankhpushpi is a herb that is commonly used in Ayurvedic medicine. It is considered to be a rejuvenating herb that helps to support the nervous system, improve memory and cognitive function, and reduce stress and anxiety. Don't be afraid to indulge in your favourite foods once in a while, just don't make it a daily habit. After all, you don't want to turn your body hotel into a 24/7 all-you-can-eat buffet for toxins.

More on that later. Moving on.. The Ayurveda Detox Process Snehana Think of Snehana as a fancy oil change for your body. Just like how you take your car in for regular oil changes to keep it running smoothly, Snehana does the same for your body. It helps to lubricate and nourish it, so it can function at its best. And let's be real, who doesn't love a good spa day? Except this time, instead of mud masks, you're getting a luxurious oil massage. Talk about a win-win situation! It's a treatment that can be applied to the body, head or ears. Snehana is used to prepare the body for other treatments, it is often used before Abhyanga (massage) or Panchakarma (a set of therapeutic procedures) to increase the penetration of the treatment and to make the person feel relaxed. Swedana is a process of sweating, which helps to eliminate the toxins from the body. Once the body is prepared, the actual detox process can begin. Vimana Enters Vimana Vamana is like a spring cleaning for your body. Just like how you do a deep clean of your house to get rid of the clutter and dust, Vamana does the same for your body by getting rid of excess Kapha (one of the three doshas in Ayurveda) through therapeutic vomiting. It's like hitting the reset button on your body, leaving you feeling refreshed and rejuvenated. So, think of it as a fancy version of a \"hair of the dog\" hangover cure. Except, instead of hair of the dog, it's hair of the Kapha, and instead of a hangover, it's excess Kapha in your body. Virechana Virechana is a therapeutic purgation that removes excess Pitta (one of the three doshas in Ayurveda) in the same way that you may use a hose to clear out your eaves and remove dirt and other buildup around your home. When you do this, it's like giving your body a fresh start; you'll feel renewed and revitalised in no time. It's like a more elegant form of a \"flush the toxins out\" detox. As in, it's not poisons but excess Pitta that's causing problems. Basti Basti is like a fancy oil change for your insides. Just like how you take your car in for regular oil changes to keep it running smoothly, Basti does the same for your body by getting rid of excess Vata (one of the three doshas in Ayurveda) through therapeutic enema. Nasya Think of it as a fancy nose job for your body. Just like how people get a nose job to reshape their nose, Nasya does the same for your body by getting rid of toxins from the head and neck area through therapeutic nasal administration. It's like cleaning out the nose of your body hotel, getting rid of all the dust, debris, and toxins and leaving you feeling refreshed and rejuvenated. Think of it as similar to blowing your nose, only that you're really expelling harmful chemicals from your body rather than just mucus. It is a procedure that is done under the guidance of an Ayurvedic practitioner and is done after the Snehana and Swedana treatments. Raktamokshana It is like a fancy bloodletting for your body. Just like how people in the olden days use to do bloodletting to balance their humors, Raktamokshana does the same for your body by getting rid of toxins from the bloodstream through bloodletting. It's like giving your body a blood transfusion, but instead of getting new blood, you're getting rid of the old, toxic blood. So, think of it as a fancy version of donating blood, except instead of donating it, you're getting rid of it. Note: This therapy is not commonly used and it is not recommended to be done at home, it is important to seek guidance from a certified Ayurvedic practitioner before undergoing this treatment. So, if you're ready to kick those not-so-welcome guests out of your body hotel and give your friendly guests the VIP treatment they deserve, give Ayurvedic Detox a try.
