Not only has she helped me to be stronger through my divorce, but has helped me gain the strength to work through my fears and anxiety of raising my 4 kids alone and get back on my feet to love myself and find love in my life again. I have learned to challenge my negative thinking and gain control of my emotions/ anxiety for the first time in a long, long time. I am so thankful to her and her positive and loving demeanor. Thank you , Melissa Fenton! - Dr. Donna S. I am writing this letter of admiration and gratitude to Dr. Melissa D. Fenton, and her entire staff at Mind Body and Beyond Center in Jacksonville, Florida. I met Dr. Fenton in March of 2019, after finding her in the \"Natural Awakenings\" magazine, which I read every month because of it's natural and holistic articles related to complete health and well- being. I came to Florida leaving behind the greatest counselor I have ever known. Now I am blessed to know, two! I came to Dr. Fenton with several problems and she and her entire staff have put me back on the path to a life well lived! I would not be where I am today without them. Dr. Fenton and her staff use academia, great life experiences, and are on the \"cutting edge\" of all things related to the mind, body, and spirit of the complete person and their total well- being and healing. I highly recommend Dr. Melissa D. Fenton as well as her entire staff to make your \"life's journey\" all it can be! With Love and Gratitude, - Jeffrey S. \"I came to this place years ago and Dr. Fenton saved my life by filling me with positive thinking, instead of negative thinking. All I can say is if you were even considering something like this, go for it. It really does work.\" - Josh S. \"Working with Dr. Melissa Fenton over the past four years has helped me to grow mentally, emotionally and spiritually in more ways than I could have possibly imagined. She has helped me to see and realize the greatness of who I am. She has helped me to access a world in which at times I thought was inaccessible, reminding me that I can become and achieve anything that I put my mind to. I am eternally grateful for Melissa as she continues to inspire me on a daily basis.\" - Andrea S. Join "}
