Doctors and scientists are confident in the long-term safety of the COVID-19 vaccines for several reasons. First, these are not new vaccine technology. For example, Scientists have been studying and working with mRNA vaccines for decades. mRNA vaccines have been studied before for flu, Zika, rabies, and cytomegalovirus (CMV), and for cancer treatments. Decades of studying mRNA have shown no long-term side-effects. Second, negative effects generally occur within 6 weeks of receiving the vaccine, and regulators in many countries required at least 8 weeks of safety data. The vaccines have now been in use for over a year with over 10 billion doses administered around the world. Third, we are very confident in the track record of Canada's vaccine approval and safety monitoring system. Overall, this means that the end data and safety tests for COVID-19 vaccines are exactly the same as other vaccines that have been approved in Canada for decades. Canada's system has proven time and again that the data necessary to get through the approval process is sufficient to prove safety, even for the long-term. When considering long-term risks, a COVID-19 infection is a much more serious concern. The virus is resulting long term damage to lungs, other organs and causing many other complications. This is called post-COVID-19 syndrome, or long COVID, and it's one of the reasons why doctors recommend getting vaccinated.
