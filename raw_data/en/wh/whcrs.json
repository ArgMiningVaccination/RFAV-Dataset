In this public health initiative, we strongly encourage those who are eligible to get vaccinated. The benefits of vaccination far outweigh its risks and harms. We believe the COVID-19 vaccines will help protect all of us and our communities. With the Delta variant circulating widely, and more readily impacting younger people, the risks of being unvaccinated are greater than rare side effects from the vaccines. If you contract COVID-19, you could become severely ill and be hospitalized or even die. Even if your infection is mild, you or your child could face long-term symptoms following COVID-19 infection such as neurological problems or diminished lung function. We recommend getting vaccinated right away if you haven't yet. It is the best way to protect yourself, your loved ones, and your community. As naturopathic doctors, we believe in the power of the body to heal, and we are ready to support patients who receive the vaccine. Our work supports immune health and overall health with use of natural therapies in coordination with conventional medical approaches. We are confident that our patients who have received the vaccine are faring well and would like to reassure the public and our colleagues in naturopathic medicine that it is a strong duty we have to contribute to this public health initiative in supporting covid vaccination. As a reminder, naturopathic doctors cannot provide vaccine exemptions in the state of Pennsylvania. Please do not forego the vaccine -whether you are in excellent physical health, or if you have a chronic condition or cancer. We support your choices in health care and are champions of public health when it comes to vaccination against COVID-19.
