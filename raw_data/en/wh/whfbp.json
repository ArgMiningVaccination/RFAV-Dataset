Met Initial communication was started with the Value Analysis Committee (VAC) in which medical devices/systems that will be reaching End Of Life o r will no longer be supported by the manufacturer would be discussed on a replacement plan. The goal is to present on a monthly/quarterly basis in order to allow committee members from different levels of the organization to discuss the need and what the r eplacement options would be. Reduce the number of missing wearable patient monitors (Philips MX40 telemetry boxes). Met Biomedical Engineering Department purchased RF tags along with holders to place on each monitor. This was the clinical staff are able to know the location of each unit. The number of units have been reduced by 80%. Page 27 of 48 Proposed Performance Metrics for FY21 -22 Target Comments and Action Plan Realignment of Biomedical Technician monthly PM workload < 125 PM work orders per month Realign the PM workload for each Biomedical Technician so that less than 125 PMs are assigned. By redistributing the number of PMs throughout the year and/or to different Biomedical Technicians, it would increase the efficiency of each technician. They would be able to address the day -to-day service calls and have more time to troubleshoot in -house and not have to send the medical device to the vendor for repair. Revive risk assessment of medical equipment in Biomedical Engineering's CMMS data base and update the Biomedical Engineering Medical Equipment Management Plan (MEMP) 100% The plan is to follow TMS (Biomedical Engineering CMMS) database embedded clinical equipment risk classification formula which is E+A+[(P+F+U)/3]. Once all medical devices in the database have an assigned risk score then the MEMP will be updated and presented at an EOC committee meeting. EFFECTIVENESS The Medical Equipment Management Program has been evaluated by the multi - disciplinary Environment of Care Committee and is considered effective. GOALS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR IMPROVEMENT IN FY21 -22 Provide further training for all Biomedical T echnicians in order to continue insourcing PM and repair services. This would reduce the total cost of ownership for each medical device. Hire a Biomedical Technician I/II with dialysis background to provide support when Outpatient Dialysis (Ward 17) moves to building 5 and expands its patient stations from 13 to 30. Continue working on developing a medical equipment lifecycle plan to replace medical devices/systems every 3 -5 years. Define a capital strategy that would involve communication with ZSFG senior/executive leadership as to when a device(s) will need to be Page 28 of 48 replaced. Having a proper plan in place would help leadership in determining what device(s) should be included in their annual budget and if any requests need to be submitted to the capital equipment committee. Continue developing a definite path to identify medical technology that will bring ZSFG to the forefront of health care and overall to improve the rate of change at ZSFG when it comes to medical equipment technology. V. SAFETY MANAGEMENT SCOPE Safety Management is designed to identify and address potential safety risks in the ZSFG environment. At ZSFG, Safety Management is shared by two complementary programs, Patient Safety and Environmental Health and Safety: Patient Safety is a function of Quality Management and oversees the organization's patient safety plan and national patient safety goals. Patient Safety reports via Process Improvement and Patient Safety Com mittee (PIPS). Environmental Health & Safety (EH&S) focuses on staff health, safety, and well - being. The Environmental Health and Safety Department provides consultation, resources and training to create, maintain and improve the hospital's working environment. The goals of EH&S are to reduce or eliminate staff injuries and illnesses, and create a safe environment for all persons including staff, patients, clients, and visitors at t he ZSFG site. EH&S reports their activities through the Environment of Care Committee in both this chapter and the Hazardous Materials and Hazardous Waste Chapter. The Safety Management Program's scope encompasses all departments and areas of the ZSFG campus, except for UCSF research activities, which fall under UCSF management. ACCOMPLISHMENTS Worked with Materials Management, Infection Control and DOC Logistics to identify alternate PPE to address COVD -related supply shortages. Maintained injury rate comparable to years that EH&S was fully staffed, despite operating at 33% staffing for the entirety of the pandemic. PROGRAM OBJECTIVES/PERFORMANCE METRICS The following metrics provide the Environment of Care Committee with information Page 29 of 48 needed to evalua te performance of the Safety Management Program activities and to identify further opportunities for improvement: AIM: Keep injury/illness rate below 2019 - 2020 rate of 8.1 Not Met: COVID cases among employees drove standardized injury/illness rate (\"Incidence Rate\") above 8.1. AIM: Develop no less than two new initiatives specifically targeted at reducing staff injuries/illness. Not Met: Staffing challenges necessitated allocating our resources to other priorities. AIM: Develop no less than two new initiatives specifically targeted at reducing staff injuries. Not Met: Staffing challenges necessitated allocating our resources to other pr iorities. Objectives & Performance Indicators Results Page 30 of 48 AIM: Create database of EH&S concerns and departmental actions. Not Met: Staffing challenges necessitated allocating our resources to other priorities. AIM: Fully staff the EH&S Department. Not Met: Despite three rounds of recruitment, and several job offers made, no applicants were interested in working in the EH&S Department at ZSFG. EFFECTIVENESS Effectiveness is based on how well the goals are met and how well the scope of the performance metrics fit current organizational needs. Recognizing the significant challenge of reducing staff injuries and given the very limited resources available, the Environment of Care Committee has reviewed the Safety Management Program and found it to be effective, but needs improvement based on the objectives and performance metrics indicated in the Plan. GOALS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR IMPROVEMENT IN 2021 -2022: Make th e EH&S vacant positions more attractive to potential candidates and staff the EH&S Department. VI. SECURITY MANAGEMENT SCOPE The scope of the Security Management Plan is to assure the ongoing provision of a safe, accessible, and secure environment for staff, patients, and visitors at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital Campus. To that end, it is the overall intent of this plan to establish the framework, organization and processes for the development, implementation, maintenance, a nd continuous improvement of a comprehensive Security Management Program. This program is designed to provide protection through appropriate staffing, security technology, and physical barriers. Page 31 of 48 The scope of the Security Management Program includes: Cont inuous review of physical conditions, processes, operations, and applicable statistical data to anticipate, discern, assess, and control security risks, and vulnerabilities Ensure timely and effective response to security emergencies Ensure effective respo nses to service requests. Report and investigate incidents of theft, vehicle accidents, threats, and property damage Promote security awareness and education Enforce various hospital rules and policies Establish and implement critical program elements to i nclude measures to safeguard people, equipment, supplies, medications, and traffic control in and around the hospital and the outlying medical offices. Each management objective is listed in the table below and is marked as met or not met. If an objec tive is not met, the DPH Director of Security will review the objective, and develop a corrective action plan. ACCOMPLISHMENTS Installation of security technology in Campus Building Clinics, Psychiatric Emergency Services and Emergency Department reception and treatment pods. In response to COVID -19, in collaboration with Facility Services addressed campus building access control, resulting in an 88% reduction in loitering and illegal lodging incidents. In response to 13,339 patient related service calls, less than 1% resulted in use -of-force. Responded to 564 calls to address homelessness related incidents. Confiscated 3,394 weapons and contraband through Eme rgency Department Security Weapons Screening. Investigated 23 -moderate/high risk workplace violence threat incidents, and developed security plans to address the threat and protect the individuals involved. Workplace Violence Awareness efforts resulte d in 95% increase in workplace violence reporting. Page 32 of 48 PROGRAM OBJECTIVES Objectives Met / Not Met Comments and Action Plans An annual review of the physical conditions, processes, operations, and applicable statistical data is conducted to anticipate, discern, assess, and control security risks, and vulnerabilities. A security management plan is developed, and monitored, quarterly to address security vulnerabilities, and minimize risk. Met A 2019 -2020 security risk assessments was completed, and the security risks, vulnerabilities, and sensitive areas were identifie d and assessed through an ongoing facility - wide processes, coordinated by the DPH Director of Security, and hospital leadership. These processes were designed to proactively evaluate facility grounds, periphery, behaviors, statistics, and physical systems. Ensure timely and effective response to security emergencies, and service request, including the enforcement of hospital rules and policies. Met Security emergency response times are monitored weekly, and the outcomes are reported to the Security Leadership Committee. Service request are responded to in accordance with the Security Response Standard Operating Procedures. Report and investigate incidents of theft, vehicle accidents, threats, and property damage. Met SFSD quarterly call -for-service data, incident reports: Unusual Occurrence reports, and Threat Management and Workplace Violence data supports that time inve stigations are initiated for all crimes against persons and facility property. Page 33 of 48 Promote security awareness and education. Met Through Environment of Care Rounds, employees are provided security awareness training. Additionally, security awareness and education programs include: Non - violent Crisis Intervention, and Security Alert publications. Establish and implement critical p rogram elements to include measures to safeguard people, equipment, supplies, medications, and traffic control in and around the hospital and the outlying medical offices. Met The Director of Security in partnership with the San Francisco Sheriff's Depar tment, collaboratively establishes, and maintains communication and mutual ownership for outcomes, identification and troubleshooting of emergent safety concerns.

UNSUNG HEROES OF THE ENVIRONMENT OF CARE COMMITTEE Traditionally, the Environment of Care (EOC) Annual Report consists of seven chapters which align with Joint Commission requirements for management of a hospital's EOC. Reflecting ZSFG's strong emphasis on collaboration an d a shared mission and vision, EOC activities at ZSFG include far more than these seven -chapter heads and their programs, with other program participants working hard behind the scenes, without getting recognition for their valuable contributions. This sec tion identifies some of these participating groups, their EOC activities in the past year, their accomplishments, and challenges: Department of Education and Training (DET): Major EOC Activities DET continues to manage all education and training activities related to Workplace Violence Prevention (WVP). This includes development of curriculum, Page 45 of 48 implementation; managing multi -discipline training teams; tracking compliance and training evaluation. DET incorporated WVP questions into EOC Rounding Tool to identify education and training gaps. DET continues to collaborate with EOC stakeholders to develop Annual Education material for staff. Accomplishments Redesigned & implemented ZSFG's Workplace Violence Prevention (WVP) training plan. All departments/units providing patient contact activities will have a training team. Incorporating this model allows for curriculum to be modified to meet department/unit needs to focus on specific Cris is Prevention Intervention (CPI) strategies, such as deceleration techniques. Challenges Due to COVID -19, in -person training is limited to adhere to social distancing guidelines. Training schedule for department/unit WVP trainers will be extended until fa ll 2021. Department of Environmental Services (EVS): Major EOC Activities EVS maintains the built environment of the facility where healthcare services are provided, following regulations and guidelines, i.e., OSHA, TJC, CDC, AORN, APIC, and AHE. The EVS works in collaboration with Infection Control preventionists to review and revise policies and procedures for environmental cleaning that includes proper use of PPEs. Also ensures safe and effective chemicals selection and use for achieving disinfectio n. The policies include essential items such as checklists, timelines, and frequencies, and develop a mechanism by which to assess and improve consistency and quality. We develop and update new Porter orientation program and maintain a standard of cleanlin ess by providing a reporting methodology for tracking compliance and effectiveness of cleaning processes (ATP tests). EVS is responsible for pest control activities, by implementing an integrated pest management program (IPM) to mitigate exposure to pests in the facility. EVS collects, transports, separates, and discards waste streams, such us Regular and Regulated Medical Waste, Recycle and Compost, etc. We Train staff in the proper handling and separation to minimize landfill waste. Page 46 of 48 EVS participates in the twice a month EOC Rounds to make sure Porters follows proper protocols during their tour of duty. Also, to minimize the risk of accidents by following proper cleaning standards. EVS completes on -line work orders/requests for cleaning pr ojects; requests for tables, chairs, trashcans and segregated containers for compost/recycling/confidential. Accomplishments Worked in collaboration and guidance of IC for the participation in a joint San Francisco Chapter of the Association for Profe ssionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology (APIC) and Association for the Healthcare Environment (AHE) pilot project. The project aims to standardize environmental cleaning practices in local healthcare facilities, and to decrease HAI. A group of Porters and Supervisors were trained and certified in CHEST (Certified Healthcare Environmental Services Technician). The project was successfully completed, resulting in an increase in patient and staff satisfaction, HCAHPS and e-Videon (patient satisfaction) scores. Monitored and complied with all trainings and provided key information to IT for the proper creation of the EVS module for the new Electronic Health Record (EHR), to be used at ZSFG. Worked to implement Epic Electronic Health Record system in our department. Implementation was successful and we have eliminated most of the manual work to provide cleaning services to ZSFG. Collaborated with the Department of Human Resources, early in the new year, to hire and train the large number of employees neces sary to replace the retirees and long-term leave of the previous season. Following this, with the advent of the Covid -19 crisis, worked again with HR Dept. to acquire a number of new DSW workers, kindly provided by SFO and the Public Library, needed to deal with the ongoing pandemic. Challenges The department is dealing with an increase in Capital project work cleaning across campus and Extended Leave of Absence of front-line staff that resulted in a substantial increase in OT hours used. We are working with HR Operations to expedite hiring EVS staff and reduce OT. Department of Infection Prevention & Control (IC): Major EOC Activities IC provides technical guidance and oversight to the Environmental Services Department. This includes the review and revision of policies and procedures, ensuring safe and effective chemicals are selected/used for achieving disinfection, Page 47 of 48 and providing a reporting methodology for tracking compliance and effectiveness of cleaning processes. IC obtains input from EOC s takeholders to develop and update annual infection prevention and control educational material for staff. In addition to daily IC rounding, IC participate d in the twice a month EOC Rounds to identify infection prevention and control issues and process gaps until COVID - 19 safe work practices required their temporary suspension . IC has worked with six of the seven EOC chapters to establish standard work that incorporates infection prevention and mitigation strategies in critical aspects of their work with the Security Management chapter being the exception. Accomplishments IC, EH&S, Facilities Management and Capital Projects collaboration on development of standard work for construction projects. This successful collaboration continues to find opportunities for improvement to include participation in the development of a master planning document for ongoing seismic safety upgrade projects and renovation of building 5 from inpatient to outpatient setting . IC increased efficiency for Facilities Management by mo difying the IC permit process for small scale renovation and construction projects . The combined contractor work permit now allows projects whose IC risk assessment places in a no or low risk to patients category to proceed without an additional stand -alone IC permit. IC worked with Facilities Management to assess and improve workplace environments to meet the needs of COVID -19 social distancing practices. Challenges There are multiple competing \"high priority\" issues and projects which make it difficult for IC to establish stable partnerships with the various departments, e.g. nursing, EVS, Facilities and the ORs, to allow for CQI activities. The primary focus for IC department since February 2020 has been the COVID -19 pandemic. The activities done in response to COVID -19 include the development of a COVID -19 FAQ intranet site that is maintained by IC program manager, multiple site visits to majority of campus to assess safe work practices, creation and implementation of multiple COVID -19 specific polic ies in addition to modification of existing policies, primarily related to use of PPE and development of appropriate COVID -19 patients based on their phase of diagnosis, illness and exposure status . Other e xamples of on-going issues include high patient census, implementation of the new electronic healthcare record (EHR) system with its new processes for managing infection and isolation needs, and the multiple current and planned construction activities across the campus. Page 48 of 48 Department of Pharmaceutical Services (DPS, \"Pharmacy\") Major EOC Activities DPS is responsible for ensuring the safety and integrity of pharmaceuticals in medication rooms to comply with the various regulatory requirements (eg. Board of Pharmac y, CDPH -Title 22, TJC). This includes checking the medication room for proper labeling and storage, security & documentation of compliance for emergency drug supplies, access to pertinent information (eg. LASA list, High Alert medications list, Do Not Cru sh list). DPS participates in the twice a month EOC Rounds to identify medication labeling and storage issues and gaps. Accomplishments Provided medications and staffing to COVID Command Center, Containment sites and alternate care sites throughout the city during the COVID -19 pandemic Medication -related information (eg.
