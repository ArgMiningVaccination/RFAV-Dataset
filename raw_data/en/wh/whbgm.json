A protocol is a scientific document with in-depth plans for a specific research effort. It can help researchers explain what they want to learn and how they'll carry out their work. Although the All of Us Protocol is written for researchers, it may be of interest to others. It has a wealth of information about the program, from who can join and what data All of Us will collect to how the program will protect that data and who will be able to access it. The All of Us Protocol is revised periodically as the program makes updates and adds new features.
