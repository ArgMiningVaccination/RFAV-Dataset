Founding Director of Source Healing Founder of The Awakened Now Acupuncturist + Herbalist SPECIALTIES Intuitive Energy Healing, Life Guidance, Stress Manifestations in the body Christie started practicing Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine in 1999 with a passion to assist people through health crises that often happened with life transitions. Before long, her little word-of-mouth practice blossomed into a full business, and Source Healing opened at its current location in the River North neighborhood of downtown Chicago. Christie realized her passion for the healing arts after she watched her dad move through his healing process when he was diagnosed with Stage IV cancer. She wanted to help people get in touch with their own body's ability to heal and teach them to become aware of the effects of emotional and spiritual disharmony in the physical body and take action before they debilitated to a point of no return. Christie made it a goal to not only heal her own heart but to educate her clients for lifelong empowerment and evolution in health and wellbeing. That is what Source Healing does. Christie received a Masters Degree from the Midwest College of Oriental Medicine and her B.A. in History and Literature from the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. She also studied acupuncture in Japan under the direction of Nakao Sunsae, was an apprentice to herbal master Dr. Zhengang Guo in Chicago, and interned with John Pirog. Christie has appeared as a guest on several cable shows, on the E! channel, and on FOX News. She has been featured in the Chicago Tribune, RedEye, and Chicago's own 190N. Dr. Reecha Patel, N.D.

Reecha hopes to inspire her patients to live their healthiest lives, as naturally as possible.

Acupuncturist + Herbalist Asian Bodywork Therapist SPECIALTIES Pain Management, Sports Injuries, Internal Medicine, Complex Chronic Diseases, Neuropathies, Qigong Instruction David began his journey in Chinese Medicine while studying biomaterial engineering at the University of Illinois. After working on a biomaterial design project for arthritis, he felt that his design didn't prevent or get at the root of why the disease appeared in the first place. This led to enrollment in a course on medicinal plants and herbology where David discovered his calling in Chinese herbal medicine. David earned his Masters of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine from the Seattle Institute of East Asian Medicine in 2014. Shortly thereafter, he moved to Taiwan to study Mandarin and get closer to Chinese culture, so that he might better understand the roots of the medicine. He used his newly obtained fluency in late 2017 to further his studies at the Wang Ju-yi Applied Channel Theory Research Center in Beijing, and continue his studies in taijiquan and qigong. David has practiced in a variety of settings including community acupuncture, solo private practice, and integrative medicine. During that time David has established himself as a general practitioner, capable of treating issues of physical and internal medicine utilizing bodywork, acupuncture, Chinese herbal medicine, and qigong instruction. David's assessment process involves extensive hands-on examination, and the blending of intellect and intuition based on years of experience. By examining the course of the acupuncture channels on the arms and legs, he brings physiology beneath his fingertips to better understand the interconnected nature of the body's systems, and to clearly distinguish the roots of imbalance. David honors the innate ability of our bodies to heal and self-regulate, and carries out treatment with the goal that patients will leave with the tools and capabilities necessary to return to self-regulation and carry on with their lives as desired.
