Published online: 2019-01-17ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Die guideline provides evidence-based key recommendations for diagnosis and treatment of ulcerative colitis and upgrades the 2011 version. The guideline was developed by an interdisci- plinary team of gastroenterologists, surgeons, pathologists,nutrition experts, and patien t support groups under the aus- pice of the German Society for Gastroenterology and MetabolicDiseases. The guideline used structural S3 consensus-basedmethodology and includes statements on clinical practice, pre-vention, infectiological problems, surgery and nutrition. 1. About these guidelines Publisher Coordinating professional association German Society for Gastroenterology, Digestive and Stoffwechselerkrankungen, DGVS). Scope and goals In Germany, about 150 000 people suffer from ulcerative colitis. For most patients, the disease begins during school or vocational train- ing and continues throughout their lives. Ulcerative colitis not onlycauses individual suffering and a reduced quality of life; it also cau-ses considerable costs for society. However, many patients still donot receive adequate therapy. The updating of the guidelines, whichwere last updated in 2011, is therefore considered particularlyimportant by the professional associations involved. Aims and objectives The aim of the guideline is to be easy to apply in general practice, internal medicine, surgery, paediatrics and gastroenterology. Cases of especially severe and/or complicated disease, as en-countered in specialised treatment centres or outpatient units,may exceed the scope of this guideline. Since the subtopics \"Extraintestinal manifestations \",\"IBD- associated diseases \"and \"Pain \"were dealt with in the last Crohn 's Disease guidelines of 2014, these sections have not been re-viewed in the present ulcerative colitis guideline. \"Infectious problems \"as well as the topic \"Nutrition \"were not specifically ad- dressed in the last Crohn 's disease guidelines, and were therefore specifically dealt with in this guideline. Patient target groups are patients with ulcerative colitis of any age. Target user group This guideline is designed for use by all healthcare professionalsinvolved in the diagnostics and therapy of patients with ulcerativecolitis, including general practitioners, paediatricians, patholo- gists, consultant gastroenterologists and specialists in internal medicine, surgeons, IBD nurses and assistants, as well as patients,Contents Page 1.

Constitution of the guideline group: Involvement of profes- sional societies, specialist networks and patient associations The revision of the guidelines was led by two main coordinators (Axel Dignass, Frankfurt and Torsten Kucharzik, L\u00fcneburg) a steering group ( Table 1 ). Alongside the steering committee, five working groups (WGs) were formed, each headed by two group leaders ( Table 2 ). Due to the considerable extent of the topics to be covered, the WG ondiagnostics was headed by three group leaders. Each WG comprised balanced proportions of university-based and non-university-based physicians, hospital physicians and office-based physicians. Alongwith includi pathologists, specialists in complementary medicine, clinical nutrition experts,specialist IBD nurses and assistants (Society of Medical Assistantsfor IBD (FACED)), as well as patients with IBD (DCCV). All members of each WG participated in an online survey, and almost all took part in the consensus conference (CC). Representativity of the guideline team: Participating professional societies DGVS; German Society for Gastroenterology, Digestive Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Stoffwechselkrankheiten) DGAV; (Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Allgemein- und Disease (Fachangestellte f\u00fcr chronisch of f\u00fcr Koloproktologie) Also invited to participate in the guideline revision were the Ger- man Society of General Medicine and Family Medicine (Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Allgemeinmedizin und Familienmedizin, DEGAM), which was unable to join the guidelines team due to insufficientavailability of personnel, and the German Society of Internal Med-icine (Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Innere Medizin e. V. DGIM), join. Representativity of the gui deline team: Direct patient participation Several patient members of the German Crohn 's Disease/Ulcera- tive Colitis Association (Deutsche Morbus Crohn/Colitis ulcerosaVereinigung (DCCV) e. V.) were directly involved as members of the working groups. Methodological Precision Research strategies, choice and evaluation of scientific evidence (evidence base) The previous version of this guideline was the S3 Guideline for Ulcerative Colitis of 2011 and 2008. Due to new methodological requirements, the methodology to be applied was discussed in atelephone conference within the steering group on July 5, 2016and subsequently agreed upon before the start of the revision. The search strategy of the last colitis guideline was revised and edited by the coordinators together with the working group lea-ders. The clinical guideline services usergroup (CGS) was commis-sioned with the systematic literature search of this update; the literature search was carried out by Maria Kallenbach. Initially, a systematic search was performed for existing guidelines. Thesewere evaluated using the German Instrument for MethodicalGuideline Evaluation (Deutsche Leitlinien-Bewertungsinstrument,DELBI), and a guideline synopsis was compiled. For topics of particular clinical importance or controversiality, or subject to frequent misapplicat ion of guidelines, the WG leadersTable 1 Steering committee. name location responsibilities B.

Until the consensus conferencetook place, the literature could be supplemented by publicationsknown to WG members which were not found during the systema-tic literature search. Recommendations for which no new evidence was available were taken unchanged from the old guidelines. The literature review was conducted according to evidence classification of the Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine2011 (Fig. 1 ). Details on the search and selection and evaluation of evidence are presented in the guidelines report. Wording of recommendations and structure of consensus building On the basis of the literature search, selection and evaluation of the evidence, the recommendations and background texts were developed by the WGs and circulated by e-mail within the individ-ual WGs until agreement was reached. When correlating theevidence strength to the level of recommendation, the recom-mendation grade could be up- or downgraded compared to thestrength of the evidence for the reasons given in Fig. 2 .T h e graduation of the recommendations was also done on the formu-lation should, can ( Table 3 ). All recommendations were agreed in a two-staged consensus process:1. online-based consensus using the Delphi method2. a moderated final consensus conference Strength of consensus was classified as shown in Table 4 . Following the final consensus conference, the guidelines under-went final revision by the WG leaders and were structured and edited for publication by the coordinators. Statements Statements are descriptions or explanations of specific facts or questions without an immediate request for action. The state-ments may derive from either study data or expert opinion, andwere agreed in accordance with the formal consensus procedureemployed for the recommendations. Expert consensus Expert consensus refers to recommendations for which no sys-tematic search for literature has been carried out or for which noliterature is available after extensive research. As a rule, these recommendations address procedures of good clinical practice for which clinical studies are neither required nor available. Whileexpert consensus was not graded using symbols, the strength ofthe recommendations is expressed by their wording (should, can)according to the gradation in Table 3 . Details regarding wording of recommendations and the struc- tured consensus finding are described in the guidelines report.External evaluation and approval Adoption by the board of directors of the issuing profes- sional societies and associations Following the peer review process, the complete guideline was reviewed and agreed upon by all participating professional asso-ciations. Editorial independence and funding of the guideline Literature search, conferences and travel expenses were financed by the DGVS. There was no financial involvement of third parties. Mandate holders and experts worked exclusively on an honorarybasis. Declaration and handling of conflicts of interest In accordance with regulations concerning the handling of con-flicts of interest issued by the Association of the Scientific MedicalSocieties in Germany (Arbeitsgemeinschaft der Wissenschaftli-chen Medizinischen Fachgesellschaften, AWMF), all involved per-sons submitted a declaration of their conflicts of interest on theofficial AWMF form prior to the consensus conference. Conflicts of interests were reviewed by the guideline coordinators and the DGVS (P. Lynen) and presented to the guidelines group before theconsensus conference began. The elected representativesdeclared a large number of potential conflicts of interest. In theopinion of the guideline group, both the interdisciplinary natureof the involved parties (including representatives of the patientassociations), and the entirely independently performed systema-tic search and evaluation of the literature served to offset any conflicts of interest of the indivi duals concerned. After critical assessment by the guidelines group, elected representatives whodeclared personal financial rew ards (membership of advisory boards, consultancy or lecturing) were not excluded from the vot-ing, provided the financial rewards were not unilateral (e. g. mem-bership of several advisory boards) and the scientific expertisewas indispensable. Payments exclusively attributable to scientificinstitutions (e. g. support grants, study funding) did not lead to exclusion from the voting. Representatives who did not declare their conflicts of interest and representatives who had ownershipinterests (e. g. patents, stocks or shares, company affiliation) werenot entitled to vote. After thorough appraisal of all declaredconflicts of interest, no representatives were excluded. Conflictsof interest are published in the guideline report. Distribution and implementation Distribution and implementation concept The German guideline has been published in the German gastro-enterology journal \"Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Gastroenterologie \",o nt h e (www.awmf.org) and on theDGVS homepage (www.dgvs.de) . The English translation is published in Pubmed (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). A patient guideline prepared by the Gastroliga and the DCCV (www.dccv.de), and acompact version (synopsis), will also be made available. 166 Kucharzik T et al.

Validity period and updating procedures This updated guideline was most recently revised in May 2018. Its validity is estimated at approximately four years. The next revisionprocess will be initiated by the DGVS guideline officer. Should therebe important innovations in the diagnosis and therapy of ulcerativecolitis in the meantime which appear to necessitate updating theguidelines, the guidelines coordinators will decide together withthe steering group (B. Bokemeyer, P. Kienle, B. Siegmund, A. Stallmach) on the necessity and possible contents of an update.This will then be published online on the AWMF guideline portaland the DGVS homepage.

Diagnostics Classification RECOMMENDATION 2.1 The disease should be classified according to its extent. Its localisation should be endoscopically classified as proctitis(limited to the rectum only), left-sided colitis (extending up to the left flexure) or extensive colitis. Expert consensus, strong recommendation, strong consensus Background The classification of ulcerative colitis (UC) according to the extent of the disease is useful for two main reasons: Firstly, thedisease location defines the choice of topical and/or systemicapplications of the medication, especially with regard to 5-ASA preparations. In case of proctitis, suppositories are preferred, while enemas and foams can be used in left-sided colitis. Exten-sive colitis should be treated using oral medication which, accord-ing to the study of Marteau, should ideally be combined with anadditional topical 5-ASA therapy [1]. Secondly, disease extentinfluences the necessity to commence endoscopic carcinomascreening. Thus, the recommendation for screening colonoscopydiffers according to disease extent (see 2.28 -2.31). The prefer- red classification distinguishes three localisations; proctitis, left-sided colitis, and extensive colitis extending beyond the leftflexure (Montreal Classification) [2] ( Table 5 ). RECOMMENDATION 2.2 Concomitant PSC should be documented, since it influences the endoscopic surveillance strategy. Expert consensus, strong recommendation, strong consensus Background Documentation of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is important, since it is associated with an increased risk for thedevelopment of colorectal carcinoma [3, 4]. This is reflected inthe colon carcinoma surveillance programme recommended for patients with ulcerative colitis and concomitant PSC (see 2.32).Table 4 Classification of degree of consensus. consensus % agreement strong consensus > 95 consensus > 75 -95 majority approval > 50 -75 no consensus < 50Table 3 Definition of classes of recommendation (A, B, C). recommendation grade (S3 only)description syntax A strong recommendation should B recommendation should Cn e u t r a lc a n 168 Kucharzik T et al.

Medical History RECOMMENDATION 2.3 The medical history should be based on detailed questioning on the types and onset dates of symptoms, recent travel his- tory, nutritional allergies/intolerances, contact with infectious diarrhoeal diseases, vaccination status, smoking status, familymedical history and medication history (especially concerningantibiotics and nonsteroidal an tirheumatic drugs). In addi- tion, the anamnesis should include questions covering extra- intestinal manifestations (mouth, skin, eyes and/or joints),perianal abscesses, fistulae and anal fissures.Expert consensus, Recommendation, Consensus Background In internal medicine, a comprehensive medical history and physical examination are of course a part of daily routine and notspecific to patients with ulcerative colitis. There are nonethelesscertain aspects which play a particularly important role in ulcera-tive colitis and therefore deserve special attention. The distinction between Crohn 's disease and ulcerative colitis can sometimes be difficult or impossible. The absence of rectal blood loss or symptoms in active smokers should be more reminis-cent of Crohn 's disease. Infectious or drug-induced colitis should be defined based on the medical history as far as possible. Use of non-steroidal antirheumatic drugs (NSARs) appears to increase the riskof disease exacerbation in existing ulcerative colitis [5 -8]. Almost half of patients with ulcerative colitis experience disease progression which necessitates the use of immunosuppressive therapies with steroids, thiopurines or TNF antibodies [9, 10]. The risk of opportunistic infections under immunosuppressive therapy,especially under multiple immunos uppressants, is significantly increased [11]. Hence, assessment and completion of the recom-mended vaccination programme is advised both by ECCO, in aconsensus statement, and by the DGVS in the present guideline. Active smoking has a protective effect with regard to the development and severity of ulcerative colitis [12, 13]. However, ex-smokers have a 70 % higher risk of developing ulcerative colitis, and more often suffer a refractory and extensive disease course,even compared with patients who have never smoked. Hospitali-sation and colectomy rates are also higher in ex-smokers than inpatients who have never smoked [14, 15]. Ex-smokers who startsmoking again appear to experience a milder disease course [16, 17]. The question remains controversial as to whether smok-ing can prevent the occurrence of PSC or pouchitis after colect-omy and ileoanal pouch construction [18, 19]. Appendectomyalso seems to play a role in the development of ulcerative colitis. Cohort studies and a meta-analysis indicate that childhood appendectomy (due to \"genuine \"appendicitis) has a protective effect (69 % risk reduction) with regard to the later developmentand severity of ulcerative colitis. Again, however, not all subse-quent studies have confirmed these data [16, 20 -25]. Neverthe- less, it seems that appendectomy has a protective effect additiveto the effect of smoking, whereas appendectomy does not hinderthe development of PSC. Appendectomy after the onset of ulcera- tive colitis apparently has no further positive effect. Therefore, although the data on appendectomy are interesting from anepidemiologic and pathophysiological point of view, they haveno therapeutic consequences in everyday clinical practice and arenot considered in these recommendations. Family medical history is of particular anamnestic importance. First degree relatives of patients with ulcerative colitis have a10- to 15-fold increased risk of developing ulcerative colitis them- selves [17]. However, the life-long risk of first-degree relatives for developing ulcerative colitis is only 5 % (or conversely, 95 % for notgetting ulcerative colitis). This is valuable information for patientsconsidering family planning. Family cases of ulcerative colitisseem to predominantly affect females; furthermore, first symp-toms in these patients seem to occur at a younger age comparedwith sporadic cases [26]. RECOMMENDATION 2.4 At initial diagnosis and if specific symptoms occur, a complete physical examination should be performed, including oral andperianal inspection, and considering any extraintestinal mani-festations. If not done previously, rectal examination should be performed during colonoscopy. Expert consensus, strong recommendation, consensus Background In patients with ulcerative colitis who have no extraintestinal manifestations, physical examination is relatively unspecific. Clini-c a ls y m p t o m ss u c ha sd i a r r h o e a ,t e n e s m u sa n dr e c t a lb l e e d i n gfrequently predominate, while severe flares may additionally be characterised by tachycardia, weight loss, abdominal resistance and/or reduced bowel sounds. There was much debate, both inthe working group and in the plenum, on the necessity for perianalinspection and rectal examination. These are, of course, not requir-ed at every patient consultation visit, but are generally performedduring colonoscopy. In view of the increased risk of (colo-)rectalcarcinoma in individuals with ulcerative colitis, however, the docu-mentation of a rectal examination appears justified. Patients should be explicitly questioned concerning extraintestinal mani- festations of the eyes, mouth, joints and skin, and also with regardto perianal manifestations [27].Table 5 Extent of disease in ulcerative colitis (according to Silver- berg et al.

RECOMMENDATION 2.5 In children and adolescents, the development of weight, height and puberty stage should be additionally documented at initialdiagnosis and regularly during the course of the disease. Expert consensus, strong recommendation, strong consensus Background To facilitate the diagnosis of growth retardation in children and adolescents, the z-score or standard height-weight ratio in compari- son to national gender-specific reference values is to be documented. In case of growth retardation, bone age is to be determined by meansof an x-ray examination of the non-dominant hand. In addition, thepuberty stage according to Tanner should be determined [28]. RECOMMENDATION 2.6 Diagnosis of ulcerative colitis should be based on a combina- tion of medical history, clinical examination and typicallaboratory, sonographic, endoscopic and histological findings.Expert consensus, strong recommendation, consensus RECOMMENDATION 2.7 In case the diagnosis remains doubtful, endoscopy, including histological sample collection, should be repeated at an inter-val, e. g. after 3 -6 months. Evidence grade 4, recommendation grade B, consensus Background The natural course of ulcerative colitis is characterised by episodic disease flares, alternating with phases of remission. At presentation, it may be difficult to rule out infectious colitis, since only the disease course shows the chronic characteristics of the dis-ease (see below). Rarely (only about 5 % of patients) the course ofdisease can be continuous without intermittent remission phases.Equally prevalent is the manifestation of ulcerative colitis as a singleflare with subsequent prolonged continuous remission [29]. Rapidestablishment of the diagnosis, including the extent and severity ofthe relapse, enables an optimal therapeutic strategy. However, there is no gold standard for the diagnosis of ulcerative colitis. The diagnosis is based on the combination of typical findings in medicalhistory, endoscopy, sonographic/radiological techniques andhistopathology. Pathomorphological criteria are determined frombiopsies endoscopy or through examination ofsurgical specimens. If mucosal histopathology shows normal find-ings, active ulcerative colitis can be ruled out. Within 5 years ofinitial diagnosis, the diagnosis is amended in approximately 10 % of patients to Crohn 's disease, or the diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease is discarded entirely. Therefore, especially if thereare doubts concerning the diagnos is, it is advisable to repeat the endoscopic examination with histological sampling in order togain endoscopic and histopathological confirmation [30]. In a min- ority of patients, an exact categorisation of the disease according tothe entities of ulcerative colitis or Crohn 's disease will not be possi- ble, even in the long term. Such cases are described as \"indetermi- nate colitis \"(or, according to the Montreal Working Party 2005: Inflammatory Bowel Disease unclassified (IBDu)) [2, 31]. Diagnosis RECOMMENDATION 2.8 Initial laboratory diagnostics should include at least the fol- lowing parameters in addition to the blood count: inflamma-tion status, iron status, renal function, transaminases and cholestasis parameters. Evidence grade 4, recommendation grade B, strong consensus RECOMMENDATION 2.9 When monitoring therapeutic response, CRP and/or faecal neutrophil markers can serve as laboratory parameters of disease progression. Evidence grade 2, recommendation grade 0, majority approval Background In every patient with ulcerative colitis, minimum laboratory diagnostics should include blood count, inflammatory markers(CRP), iron status parameters, renal retention parameters, transa-minases and cholestasis parameters. In some cases, however, especially in mild to moderate ul cerative colitis and/or distal disease, laboratory values may be within the normal referenceranges. Unless disease is limited to proctitis (which is not usuallyassociated with abnormal laboratory values), C-reactive proteincorrelates with the extent of disease and weakly with clinicalactivity [32, 33]. Although the CRP incr ease is generally less pro- nounced in patients with ulcerative colitis than in patients withCrohn 's disease, in CRP-positive patients, it can provide a useful marker for clinical and endoscopic activity [34]. As a rule, patients with severe disease activity also show increased erythrocyte sedi-mentation rates (ESR) and anaemia. The significance of faecalstool markers, and in particular calprotectin, as markers of clinicaland endoscopic inflammatory activity in ulcerative colitis, hasbeen demonstrated in a number of studies [35 -38]. However, neither serological markers such as CRP nor faecal inflammationmarkers can differentiate ulcerative colitis from an infectious cause. Two small studies report procalcitonin to be useful for the differentiation of self-limiting aetiologies of colitis [39, 40]. Espe-cially during the initi al diagnosis, stool cultures are helpful for differentiating and diagnosing self-limiting infectious colitis[41, 42] (see recommendation 2.10). As a marker of iron status, ferritin is only of limited use, since it is an acute-phase protein and may therefore be increased in thepresence of inflammation, irrespective of body iron stores. There- fore, in case of doubt, transferrin saturation and/or soluble trans- 170 Kucharzik T et S3-Guideline Ulcerative ...Z Gastroenterol 2019; 57: 162 -241Leitlinie This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. ferrin receptor levels should additionally be determined [43 -46]. Due to their low sensitivity, routine determination of cytoplasmic antibodies (ASCA) inCrohn 's disease is not recommended as a means of differentiating the two disease entities [47]. Nevertheless, it may prove helpful in certain cases. In most of the literature, the reported prevalence ofpANCA is up to 65 % in patients with ulcerative colitis and less than10 % in patients with Crohn 's disease [48, 49]. A large metaanaly- sis of 60 studies showed a sensitivity of 55 % (specificity 93 %) forthe constellation ASCA+/pANCA- for the detection of Crohn 's disease, while the sensitivity of pANCA+ for detection of ulcerativecolitis was found to be 55 % (specificity 89 %) and even higher in paediatric patients (70 %/93 %) [50]. RECOMMENDATION 2.10 Intestinal infection should be excluded at initial diagnosis and whenever symptoms suggesting an acute flare arise during follow-up. Evidence grade 4, recommendation grade B, consensusAt initial diagnosis, microbiological stool diagnostics shouldbe infectious pathogens Clostridium difficile toxin.Evidence grade 2, recommendation grade B, consensusIn patients with appropriate travel history, complementarydiagnostics should be carried out with respect to typical regional pathogens. Evidence grade 4, recommendation grade B, consensus Background In the initial diagnosis, the differentiation from infectious causes, which are usually self-limiting, is important. Stool samplesshould be tested for 0157:H7 and Clostridium difficile toxins A and B. Depending on the medical history, special diagnostic stool tests may be useful, such as stool microscopy and stool anti-gen tests for amoebae or other parasites. Specific diagnostics willbe addressed in detail in the chapter on infections (Chapter 4). RECOMMENDATION 2.11 In the case of established ulcerative colitis, microbiological diagnostics including tests for Clostridium difficile toxin andcytomegalovirus should be carried out in the event of a severedisease flare or therapy-refractory course, and prior to inten-sification of immunosuppressive therapy.Evidence grade 2, recommendation grade A, strong consensus Background In the further course, stool diagnosis does not have to be repeated with every relapse [42, 51]; however, in particular, if disease is severeor refractory, or if the flare was anamnestically preceded by intake of antibiotics (see also Chapter 4: infections). RECOMMENDATION 2.12 Quantitative determination o f faecal neutrophil markers (e. g., calprotectin) should be included in clinical differentialdiagnostics to distinguish symptoms from (functional) symp-toms of irritable bowel syndrome.Evidence grade 2, recommendation grade B, consensus RECOMMENDATION 2.13 For the diagnostic monitoring of established ulcerative colitis, the quantitative determination of faecal neutrophil markersshould be used.Evidence grade 1, recommendation grade B, strong consensus Background A number of different faecal inflammatory markers have been investigated in inflammatory bowel disease, to offer the highest sensitivityas markers of intestinal inflammation, and correlate with the clin-ical and endoscopic severity of inflammation in ulcerative colitis[63, 64]. Faecal markers are, however, of limited diagnostic value in the primary diagnosis of ulcerative colitis, being unable to distinguish between different causes of intestinal inflammation.Nevertheless, faecal markers are helpful in differentiating func-tional symptoms and especially in paediatric diagnostics. Theresults of several trials have shown that faecal calprotectin levelsare significantly higher in both paediatric and adult patients withinflammatory bowel disease than in healthy controls or patientswith irritable bowel syndrome. The markers can therefore be used very well as differentiation markers for irritable bowel syndrome or for non-inflammatory causes of intestinal com-plaints, especially in paediatrics [65 -68]. Furthermore, several studies have shown that calprotectin is a highly sensitive and specific indicator of endoscopic diseaseactivity in ulcerative colitis even before the onset of clinical symp-toms, making it a reliable early marker of disease relapse [37, 38,69, 70]. Faecal neutrophil markers can therefore aid the assess- ment of patient symptoms in daily practice. In addition, the individual longitudin al profiles of neutrophil markers provide a good overview of disease activity. Endoscopic Diagnostics RECOMMENDATION 2.14 If ulcerative colitis is suspected, an ileocolonoscopy with biop- sies from the terminal ileum and all colon segments including the rectum (at least 2 biopsies per segment, submission in 171 Kucharzik T et al. Updated S3-Guideline Ulcerative ...Z Gastroenterol 2019; 57: 162 -241 This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. separate sample tubes) should be performed to confirm the diagnosis and to determine the extent of the disease.Evidence grade 4, recommendation grade B, consensus Background Full colonoscopy, with intubation of the terminal ileum and segmental extraction of intestinal biopsies, is preferable tosigmoidoscopy in the initial diagnosis of patients with suspected ulcerative colitis, since it enabl es the determination of disease localisation and extent, and to a large degree, the exclusion ofCrohn 's terminal ileitis [71, 72]. This approach appears to be more cost-effective than index sigmoidoscopy [73, 74]. During the initial diagnosis, at least two biopsies each should be obtained from the ileum and all colon segments, includingthe rectum. The tissue specimens should be labelled separatelyaccording to their localisation. If diagnosis is uncertain, subse- quent endoscopic re-evaluation with appropriate histopathologi- cal assessment may be required. It has been reported that inapproximately 10 % of patients, the initial diagnosis of ulcerativecolitis is retracted or changed to Crohn 's disease within five years [75]. In patients with acute severe colitis, complete colonoscopy isnot recommended and should first be replaced by sigmoidoscopy. RECOMMENDATION 2.15 Routine colonoscopy should not be carried out in patients with ulcerative colitis in remission until carcinoma surveillanceis required.Expert consensus, recommendation, strong consensusEndoscopic re-evaluation can be considered as a means of assessing therapy response and for decision-making with regard to therapy de-escalation in patients receiving immuno-suppressive or biological therapies.Expert consensus, recommendation open, strong consensus RECOMMENDATION 2.16 Endoscopic evaluation may be performed in patients with therapy-refractory disease to confirm disease activity andrule out infectious or other complications.Expert consensus, recommendation open, consensus Background Despite the importance of assessing the extent of the disease in determining the prognosis, the need for monitoring and the choice of therapy, the adequacy of regular repeat examina- tions after index colonoscopy has not yet been investigated.Drug-induced clinical remission is not necessarily associated withendoscopic and histological remission [76]. There are numerousindications that so-called healing is associated with amore favourable clinical outcome [77]. Systematic reviews have demonstrated an association of mucosal healing with avoidanceof colectomy and the Therefore, endoscopic re-assessment may be consideredin patients who achieve a drug-induced clinical remission. Likewise, assessment of mucosal healing can be integrated into the decision-making process regarding therapy de-escalation in patients treated with immunosuppressants or biologicals who are in stable clinical remission. Although corresponding data in ulcerativecolitis are sparse, results in Crohn 's disease have been promising [80]. Numerous indices are available for the clinical or endoscopic assessment of disease activity. These indices are rarely used in dai-ly routine, but are used in clinical trials. While endoscopic activityis commonly assessed using the endoscopic Mayo Score [81], theonly validated endoscopic activity index is the Ulcerative Colitis Endoscopic Index of Severity (UCEIS) [82]. To date, the clinical classification of severe ulcerative colitis is widely based on Truelove and Witts 'classification dating from 1955 [83], since it is easy to remember and simple to use. Thisclassification is still considered the method of choice to identifypatients in need of immediate hospitalisation and intensive ther-apy [84]. In paediatric patients, the PUCAI according to Turner hasbecome established [85]. Diagnostic differentiation from Crohn 'sd i s e a s e RECOMMENDATION 2.17 If colitis cannot be clearly classified, the upper gastrointestinal tract should be examined by eosophagogastroduodenos copy (with biopsies) and the mid-ga strointestinal tract by MRI of the small bowel and/or abdominal sonography. Expert consensus, recommendation, strong consensus Background If diagnostic ambiguities are present (e. g., disease-free rec- tum, unusual symptoms, endoscopic evidence of backwash ilei-tis), the presence of Crohn 's disease should be considered for differential diagnosis and, depending on the clinical context,appropriate diagnostics of the upper and middle digestive tract should be performed. Diagnostic procedures should be per- formed analogous to the current DGVS guidelines for the diagno-sis and therapy of Crohn 's disease [86]. Ultrasound RECOMMENDATION 2.18 High-resolution abdominal sonography should be an integral part of initial and follow-up diagnostics, and should be used to detect complications in patients with severe relapse.Evidence grade 2, recommendation grade B, strong consensus Background Transabdominal ultrasound can detect inflammation of the colon with a sensitivity of up to 90 %. Moreover, sonography isinexpensive and non-invasive. As with all diagnostic procedures, 172 Kucharzik T et al. Updated S3-Guideline Ulcerative ...Z Gastroenterol 2019; 57: 162 -241Leitlinie This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. however, its precision depends upon the experience of the exam- iner. In addition, there is a low specificity to differentiate ulcera-tive colitis from other causes of colitis [87 -89]. In the hands of an experienced sonographer, both the activity and the extent ofdisease can be reliably determined [90 -96]. Sonography corre- lates well with endoscopic activity and can be used as a prognostic tool due to its good correlation with therapy response [97]. Dop-pler sonography of the superior and inferior mesenteric arterieshas been used to evaluate disease activity and the risk of relapse.However, due to insufficient data and limited dissemination of thetechnique, it should not be considered a standard procedure atthe present time [98, 99]. For contrast-enhanced ultrasoundexamination (CEUS), a correlation with histological inflammatory activity has been demonstrated, but due to the insufficient data currently available, no recommendation for its use as a standardprocedure can be given [100]. Colon stenosis in ulcerative colitis RECOMMENDATION 2.19 Since the presence of a colonic stenosis in ulcerative colitis is suspicious for malignancy, ample biopsies should be taken from the area of the stenosis and additional diagnostic ima-ging (e. g., CT, MRI) performed. If the dignity of a colonicstenosis is unclear, the decision to perform surgery should bemade generously.Evidence grade 4, recommendation grade B, consensus Background In patients with long-standing ulcerative colitis, colonic stric- ture or stenosis must as a sign of colorectal carci-noma; therefore, histologic evaluation is necessary [ 101]. Due to the submucosal growth of the ulcerative colitis-associated definitive endoscopic-hist ological clarification is often problematic [102, 103]. For this reason, it seems justifiable torecommend a generous stance concerning the indication forsurgery. If colonoscopy is incomplete due to the presence of a stenosis or stricture, CT- or MR-colonography should be per- formed. CT colonography or MR colonography can identify thestructure of the mucosa and the extent of the colitis proximal tothe stricture, but may not show all lesions discernible duringcolonoscopy [104, 105]. In a retrospective cohort study ofpatients with colonic stenosis in Crohn 's disease and ulcerative colitis who had no preoperative signs of malignancy, colon carci-noma was diagnosed postoperatively in 7.8 % of patients with ulcerative colitis [106]. Ther efore, if findings are inconclusive, sur- gical resection should be performed. In spite of the sparse evi-dence, this recommendation has been made here to avoid any de-lay in surgery, in view of the possibility of colon carcinoma [106].Paediatrics RECOMMENDATION 2.20 The diagnosis of ulcerative colitis should be considered in chil- dren presenting with chronic (> 4 weeks) or recurrent (> 2 epi-sodes within 6 months) bloody diarrhoea after infectiouscauses have been ruled out.Evidence grade 4, recommendation grade B, consensus Background Children with ulcerative colitis generally show typical symp- toms such as anaemia (84 %), chronic diarrhoea (74 %) and abdominal pain, predominantly in the form of tenesmus (62 %)[107]. Diagnostics should be performed in children with chronic(> 2 weeks) or recurring diarrhoea, regardless of whether or notblood is passed in the stools. Weight loss is less typical of ulcera-tive colitis (35 %) than of Crohn 's disease (58 %). The most com- mon extraintestinal symptom is arthropathy (10 %). Manifesta-tions affecting the skin are rare. In contrast to adult patients, three quarters of paediatric patients present with extensive ulcerative colitis, whereas distal disease is uncommon. Over 50 %of paediatric patients with ulcerative colitis relapse at least once ayear. The diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease is confirmed bymeans of clinical evaluation in co mbination with biochemical, endoscopic, histological and, if Crohn 's suspected, ra- diological examinations (MRI-enterography or -enteroclysis). Thediagnostic criteria correspond to those of adult patients [108]. RECOMMENDATION 2.21 Initial diagnostics in children and adolescents with suspected inflammatory bowel disease should include ileocolonoscopywith stepwise biopsies from the terminal ileum and all colonsegments. Evidence grade 4, recommendation grade A, strong consensus An oesophagogastroduodenos copy with stepwise biopsies should be performed in the same examination procedure.Evidence grade 4, recommendation grade B, strong consensus Background The working group of the European Society of Pediatric Gastro- enterology, Hepatology and Nu trition (ESPGHAN) has defined recommendations for the diagnostic procedure [109]. Children suspected of having inflammatory bowel disease should undergofull colonoscopy with intu bation of the terminal ileum (terminal ileum, oesophagus, and duodenum [109]. Imaging of the smallbowel (usually MRI-enterography) can only be dispensed with if symptoms are clearly assigned to ulcerative colitis. Since, in con- trast to the adult patient population, three quarters of paediatricpatients have extensive colitis, full colonoscopy is obligatory.

Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. moidoscopy alone is generally not indicated except in severe ulcerative colitis, which is associated with an increased risk of bowelperforation. In paediatric patients, endoscopy should be carried outunder general anaesthesia or deep analgosedation. In paediatricpatients with disease onset during the first three years of life, or perianal lesions, or a conspicuous history of frequent or unusual infections (regardless of age), and who have consanguineous par-ents, immunological investigations should be performed to ruleout congenital immunodeficiency conditions as the cause of thecolitis. Allergic colitis or nutritional allergy as a modulating factorof inflammatory activity should be considered in the differentialdiagnosis, especially in younger children with colitis. Histopathological diagnostics -inflammation diagnostics RECOMMENDATION 2.22 Histopathological criteria which should be used for the evalu- ation of biopsies for the diagnosis of ulcerative colitis are:diffuse panmucosal chronic inflammation (lymphocytes and plasma cells) in combination with impairment of flexure Reduced proliferation of goblet cells or reduced mucin content of the individual cells, continuous pattern ofinflammatory and structural changes in the mucosa, de-creasing gradient of inflammation from distal to proximal Evidence grade 1, recommendation grade B, strong consensus RECOMMENDATION 2.23 Deviating morphological patterns may occur in ulcerative co- litis and should be considered especially in paediatric patients.Evidence grade 1, recommendation grade A, consensus RECOMMENDATION 2.24 The pathological report should include a statement on histo- logical inflammatory activity.Expert consensus, recommendation, consensus Background The diagnosis of ulcerative colitis is based on evidence of a characteristic combination of clinical, biochemical, endoscopic,radiologic and pathomorphological findings. There is no goldstandard for diagnosis. Pathohistological diagnostics rely on thesynoptic evaluation of a combination of factors primarily relatingto the type and distribution of the inflammatory infiltrates, and changes in the mucosal architecture [110 -123]. The individualhistological findings are not specific in themselves and some can also occur in other forms of inflammatory bowel disease. Typical changes in the mucosal architecture in ulcerative colitis are irregularities in shape, orientation and size of the crypts(> 10 % of the crypts; more than 2 branched, non-parallel crypts in one biopsy) [117, 119, 121, 123]. The term crypt atrophy is used to describe a reduced crypt density (i. e. a distance greaterthan the cross-section of one crypt between 2 neighbouringcrypts) and/or a displacement between the crypt base and thelamina muscularis mucosae, mostly in association plasma cell-rich infiltrate [115, 116, refers to a diffuse increase inthe number of mononuclear cells in the lamina propria including and basal mucosa layers [ 115, 119]. Basal plasmacyto- sis is defined as evidence of plasma cells in the basal region (1/5)of the lamina propria or (subcryptal) [116, distinguish ulcerative coli- tis from Crohn 's disease and other inflammatory bowel diseases, relies on assessment of the extent (pronounced, diffuse) and thetopographical distribution (continuous distribution, decreasing gradient from distal to proximal) of the histopathological criteria described in recommendation 2.22. Therefore, during the initialcolonoscopy, biopsies should be t aken stepwise from the terminal ileum and from all colon segments including the rectum, and thebioptic samples labelled accordin g to their localisation. In this way, the diagnostic value of the samples can be greatly increasedin comparison to single or unsystematic biopsies [111, 112, 124 - 127]. In order to rule out findings relevant for differential diagno- sis (e. g., epithelioid cell granuloma), the analysis of samples in stepwise- or serial sections is recommended [128, 129]. When performed as described above, histopathological diag- nosis of ulcerative colitis based on mucosal biopsies has a sensitiv-ity and specificity of over 70 % [111 -113, 118, 123], in a number of studies up to more than 90 % [120 -122], at least in the pres- ence of active disease. Several authors have proposed the use ofstandardised scoring models with numerical coefficients [120 - 122], in which evidence of two to three of the described histo- morphological criteria is required for diagnosis. In the initial stages of disease (< 4 -6 weeks), impairment of the crypt architecture may be absent, with the result that specificdiagnosis may not be possible. In this context, the detection of basal plasmacytosis can be regarded as an early sign of potentialinflammatory bowel disease [116, 117, 130, 131]. From a diagnostic point of view, it must be taken into account that the morphological appearance of inflammatory bowel dis- ease is subject to biological variations (episodic progression) andis also influenced by therapy [132, 133]. Thus, in the course ofulcerative colitis, a discontinuous pattern of inflammation maywell occur, sometimes with sparing of the rectum [134]. Atypicalmanifestations are particularly common in paediatric IBD patients(younger than 10 years), even without prior therapy [135 -138]. Information on the overall clinical picture (medical history, disease duration, type and duration of therapy, endoscopic find- ings) is therefore necessary for efficient assessment and improvesthe validity of the histological evaluation [112]. This applies parti-cularly to the diagnostic differentiation of ulcerative colitis from 174 Kucharzik T et al. Updated S3-Guideline Ulcerative ...Z Gastroenterol 2019; 57: 162 -241Leitlinie This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. other aetiologically or phenotypically defined forms of inflamma- tion matory activity in ulcerative colitis is based on the degree of tissue infiltration by segmented neutrophil granulocytes and associated damage to the intestinal epithelium, including epithelial invasionby neutrophils and the development of cryptic lesions and cryptabscesses, culminating in erosive and ulcerous lesions [115, 118,119, 121]. While histological findings and clinical disease activitycorrelate only to a limited extent in the individual patient [142],therapeutic trials have shown that clinical improvement isassociated with the abatement of active histological changes [143]. An active morphological picture is sing-remitting flares [144 -146]. The pathologist 's evaluation of histological inflammatory activity is therefore ofparticular interest with regard to the assessment of diseaseprogression. Numerous indices have become established (e. g.,Riley score). The only scores which have yet been validated arethe Nancy histological index and the Robarts histopathologyindex [147, 148]. However, due to the heterogeneity of the numerous available scores, no specific histological index is presently recommended. The potential value of histopathologyas a predictor of relapse and in monitoring the effectiveness ofanti-inflammatory therapy has implications for therapeutic management and risk reduction with regard to neoplasia. Intraepithelial Neoplasia (IEN) RECOMMENDATION 2.25 The diagnosis of intraepithelial neoplasia/dysplasia in ulcera- tive colitis should be carried out current IEN/dysplasia should be histopathologically classifiedas low-grade, high-grade or indefinite.Expert consensus, strong recommendation, strong consensus RECOMMENDATION 2.26 In the histological diagnosis of each IEN/dysplasia, a compe- tent (documented) pathological second opinion in the senseof a four-eyes principle should be ensured.Evidence grade 3, recommendation grade B, consensus Background Intraepithelial neoplasia/dysplasia is defined as a clearly neo- plastic lesion of the epithelium which is confined to the basementmembrane and shows no invasion into the lamina propria [149].Dysplasia is the most reliable marker for an increased risk of intes-tinal malignancy [150]. Intraepithelial neoplasia/dysplasia is histo-logically classified grade neoplastic transfor-mation as low-grade, high-gra de or indefinite [149]. The identification of IEN is hindered by the high variability of individual pathologists 'evaluations [151 -153] with a value of 0.4 [154],whereby the variability in low-grade and indefinite IEN is especial- ly high. In view of the profound therapeutic consequences, everyhistopathological diagnosis of \"IEN/dysplasia \"should be con- firmed by another experienced pathologist in a second evaluation. RECOMMENDATION 2.27 Any discernible lesion with IEN/dysplasia should be categorised by the endoscopist as a polypoid non-polypoid and the grade of IEN/dysplasia (LGIEN or HGIEN)defined, since this classification is of therapeutic importance. Evidence grade 3, recommendation grade B, consensus Background In accordance with the recommendations of ECCO [ 155, 156] and the international SCENIC consensus conference, the macro-scopic descriptions of IEN/dysplasia as DALM (dysplasia-associatedlesion or mass), ALM (adenoma-associated lesion or mass), ade-noma-like, non-adenoma-like, an d flat will no longer be used, because these macroscopic criteria have often been used to describe diversely shaped lesions. Visual lesions should thereforebe classified as polypoid or non-polypoid [157]. A defined as pedunculated (Paris Classifica- tion Type 1 p) or sessile (Paris Classification Type 1 s) lesion thatprotrudes from the mucosa into the lumen (> 2.5 mm) [157].These lesions can normally be removed by means of endoscopicresection [158]. Non-polypoid lesions are lesions classified as Paris Type IIa (flat-elevated), Paris classification Classification Type IIc (flat-depressed). These includevelvety patches, irregular bumps and nodules, thicken-ing, stricturing lesions and broad-based masses. removable by endoscopic resection [159 -162]. Lesions are differentiated according appear-ance. The term endoscopically invisible dysplastic lesion is used to describe a histologically evident IEN/dysplasia not visible during endoscopy. Surveillance colonoscopy RECOMMENDATION 2.28 Since colitis-associated colon cancer mortality can be reduced by surveillance colonoscopy, surveillance colonoscopiesshould be scheduled according to risk stratification. Evidence grade 3, recommendation grade B, consensus Background The effectiveness of surveillance programmes has not yet been investigated in randomised controlled trials. However, a largenumber of published case control studies and case series endorsethe benefit of screening colonoscopy [163 -167]. Three case con- trol studies examined the of surveillance colonosco- py in ulcerative colitis [168 -170]. A meta-analysis of three 175 Updated S3-Guideline Ulcerative ...Z Gastroenterol 2019; 57: 162 -241 This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. studies and two additional studies showed that surveillance colonoscopy was associated with reduced mortality in patientswith ulcerative colitis [171]. However, the evidence quality of theevaluated studies is considered to be poor. RECOMMENDATION 2.29 In order to establish the surveillance strategy, all patients with ulcerative colitis, irrespective of disease activity, shouldundergo surveillance colonoscopy 6 -8 years after initial symptoms/diagnosis, with at least two biopsies from each colon segment in addition to targeted biopsy specimens to determine the extent/localisation of inflammation.Evidence grade 2, recommendation grade B, strong consensus Background Until recently, it was widely accepted that colorectal carcino- mas rarely occur during the first eight years after disease onset.However, trials have shown that a significant proportion of colorectal carcinomas appear prior to the eighth year of disease [172, 173]. One study from the Netherlands demonstrated thatin 22 % of patients with ulcerative colitis who developed a colorec-tal carcinoma, the tumour occurred prior to beginning surveil-lance colonoscopy [174]. As a result of these data, it is recommen-ded to perform a surveillance colonoscopy between the 6 thand 8thyear of disease, regardless of disease activity, in order to histologically assess the extent of disease and thereby establish a time schedule for the surveillance programme. RECOMMENDATION 2.30 Patients with disease activity restricted to the rectum and without evidence of prior or current endoscopic and/or micro-scopic inflammation proximal to the rectum should not be included in a regular surveillance colonoscopy programme. Expert consensus, recommendation, strong consensusFor disease monitoring, and in order to avoid overlooking anyincrease in the extent of ulcer ative colitis, a surveillance colonos copy every 5 years can be considered. Expert consensus, recommendation open, strong consensus RECOMMENDATION 2.31 In patients with inflammatory activity extending beyond the rectum, regular surveillance colonoscopy should be per-formed from the 8 thyear after disease onset. Expert consensus, strong recommendation, consensusThe surveillance strategy should be individually adapted andthe interval should be based on risk stratification, as follows: high-risk patients (stenosis, IEN within the previous 5 years, extensive colitis with severe inflammation or first-grade rela-tive with CRC < 50 yrs.) should undergo surveillance colonos-copy annually, patients with intermediate risk (colitis withmild or moderate inflammation, numerous pseudopolyps, first-grade relative with CRC 50 yrs.) every 2 -3 years, and low-risk patients (with none of the factors mentioned above)every 4 years.Expert consensus, recommendation, consensus Background Patients with ulcerative colitis have an increased risk of colon carcinoma compared to the genera l population. The individual risk depends on the extent of disease. Various studies have shownthat the risk is markedly increased in patients with extensive colitisand still distinctly increased in patients with left-sided colitis, butnot clearly increased in patients with ulcerative proctitis [ 175]. While numerous studies have demonstrated an increased risk for colorectal carcinoma (CRC) in patients with ulcerative colitis,their conclusions differ as to the magnitude of the risk. Whereas earlier centre-based studies -summarised in a meta-analysis - indicated considerably higher figures (CRC risk in UC patients 2 %after 10 years; 8 % after 20 years; and 18 % after 30 years) [ 175], recent population-based studies showed only slightly increasedrates (CRC risk 0.6 -1.2 % after 10 years; 2.1 -5.4 % after 20 years; and 4.7 -7.5 % after 30 years) [176, 177]. Only in Denmark there was no increased incidence of CRC in UC patients, possibly dueto a higher colectomy rate in th e observation period [172]. Frequency correlated with disease duration, disease extent and inflammatory activity/pseudopolyps [3, 175, 178 -181]. In a meta-analysis of 116 studies published in 2001, Eaden cal- culated a cumulative risk of 18 % for colitis-associated carcinomaafter 30 years [175]. Another meta-analysis described a 2.4-foldincrease in rectal carcinoma in patients with ulcerative colitis[182]. However, more recent research seems to suggest that therisk of colorectal carcinoma may be decreasing. A Danish study by Jess in 2013 found no increased risk for CRC in UC patients, with a factor of 1.12 (0.97 -1.28), and in a case series in 2015, Choi described an only slightly increased CRC risk (0.1 % after 10 yrs.,2.9 % after 20 yrs., and 6.7 % after 30 yrs.) [183, 184]. A more recent Australian study [185] indicated a cumulative risk of colorectal carcinoma in patients with ulcerative colitis of1 % after 10 years, 3 % after 20 years and 7 % after 30 years. Thismay reflect, on the one hand, the increasing implementation of surveillance programmes, and o n the other, the growing effec- tiveness of anti-inflammatory drug therapies [186]. The aim of surveillance colonoscopy is to detect neoplasms with high sensitivity and specificity. This necessitates that the intestine iswithout significant inflammation which could be misinterpretedhistologically as intraepithelial neoplasia. Analogous to screeningcolonoscopies in the normal population, it can be assumed that thequality of colonoscopy preparation significantly influences the de- tection rate of lesions [187]. Equally, there is a correlation between withdrawal time and the rate of detection of neoplasia [188]. As aninnovation in this guideline, it is recommended that the monitoringinterval for screening colonoscopy should be adapted according torisk stratification. For this purpose, various evidence-based risk con-stellations have been defined ( Table 6 ). Adjusted according to these risk constellations, the monitoring interval thereafter is 176 Kucharzik T et al. Updated S3-Guideline Ulcerative ...Z Gastroenterol 2019; 57: 162 -241Leitlinie This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. 1y e a r ,2 -3 years or 4 years, depending on the described risk constellation [4, 152, 159, 178, 180, 186, 189 -198]. Some reports suggest that certain additional risk factors, such as a colon carcinoma in the family history, the presence of back-wash ileitis, or first manifestation of colitis in childhood or adoles-cence, may also play a role [175, 181, 199]. However, the availabledata are inconsistent. RECOMMENDATION 2.32 In patients with concomitant PSC, surveillance colonoscopies should be carried out annually from the time of PSC diagnosis,regardless of the disease activity and extent of ulcerative colitis. Evidence grade 3, recommendation grade B, consensus Background Patients with concomitant primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) are a particularly high-risk group. One meta-analysis calculated afive-fold increase in the risk of carcinoma [4, 191]. These patientsshould therefore undergo regular annual surveillance colonoscopyfrom the time of PSC diagnosis. Other investigations have shownnot only that the risk of carcinoma in UC patients with PSC is fivetimes higher [4], but also that it develops earlier [152] and is morefrequently located in the right-sided colon [191]. RECOMMENDATION 2.33 Surveillance colonoscopy with biopsy should, if possible, be carried out in the remission phase, since the histomorphologi-cal differentiation of inflammatory from neoplastic changesmay otherwise be difficult. Evidence grade 4, recommendation B, consensus Background If the colon is not in a largely inflammation-free state, inflam- matory changes may show similarities to IEN. The pathologist mayhave difficulty discerning IEN with certainty in samples affectedby active inflammation. Therefore, if a lesion is judged by the pa-thologist to be possibly suspicious for IEN, a follow-up endoscopy within 3 months (following intensi fication of anti-inflammatory therapy, if appropriate) may be required. RECOMMENDATION 2.34 Targeted biopsies should be taken from all endoscopically suspect lesions. The surveillance colonoscopy should be performed in a clean intestine with sufficient withdrawal time. Evidence grade 1, recommendation grade B, consensus RECOMMENDATION 2.35 Ideally, surveillance colonoscopy should be performed as chromoendoscopy with targeted biopsies, without additional random biopsies. Alternatively, high-definition white light endoscopy (HDWLE) with targeted biopsies of any visiblelesion, without additional random biopsies, ensuring a highdegree of meticulousness and appropriate withdrawal time,can be performed.Evidence grade 1, recommendation grade B, consensusIf HDWLE is not available, untargeted stepwise biopsiesshould additionally be collected. Evidence grade 2, recommendation grade A, consensus Background For many years, there has been much discussion regarding the necessity for additional random biopsies and/or the use of chromo-endoscopy in surveillance colonoscopy. Chromoendoscopy has be-come the established surveillance technique, achieving good resultseven without additional random sampling. Chromoendoscopy is therefore recommended as the preferred monitoring technique, with targeted biopsies but without the collection of random biop-sies. Numerous studies are available [200 -206]. However, only in recent investigations has the performance of chromoendoscopy inthe detection of dysplasia been compared endoscopes without chromoendoscopy [206 -210].

Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. development of \"high resolution \"techniques over the past few years has greatly increased the detection rate for dysplasia [211]. A recently-published study from Japan [209] demonstrated that, in high-resolution colonoscopy, targeted biopsies alone arenoninferior to targeted plus additional random biopsies. Addition- al studies in dysplasia diagnostics show that random samples in the context of a high-resolution colonoscopy system show nobenefit compared to an examination performed with targetedbiopsies only. In a systematic review from Italy pooling data fromthree randomised studies including a total of 190 patients [207],no difference in dysplasia detection rates was found betweenchromoendoscopy and high-def inition white light endoscopy (HDWLE). However, in comparison between chromoendosco- py and non-high-definition white light endoscopy (WLE), a signifi- cant difference was observed. Similar findings were reported froma unicentric trial from Canada [208] evaluating dysplasia detec-tion in 454 IBD patients from a surveillance programme. The re-sults indicated that detection of dysplasia using both HDWLE andchromoendoscopy was more effective using targeted biopsiesthan random biopsies. However, this result was not found instandard white light endoscopy (WLE). A randomised, multicentre study from Japan in 246 UC patients compared rates of dysplasia detection using random biopsies versus targeted biopsies, bothpredominantly taken during high resolution endoscopy (HDWLE).Intraepithelial neoplasia (IEN)/dysplasia was detected with equalfrequency in the random biopsy and targeted biopsy groups. These new findings are also the basis for the recommendationfor HDWLE with targeted biopsies, but without random biopsies,as a possible option for surveillance colonoscopy [206 -210, 212]. (NBI, FICE, iScan) in combination wi th targeted biopsies without random biopsies is not sufficiently defined and should there- fore not be pursued as the sole strategy. Evidence grade 1, recommendation grade B, strong consensus Background Since the value of virtual chromoendoscopy (NBI, FICE, iScan) as an additional tool to increase the effectiveness of screeningcolonoscopy in ulcerative colitis is currently not clearly definedon the basis of the available studies, it should not be employed as a sole strategy [213 -220]. RECOMMENDATION 2.37 In patients with suspected IEN/dysplasia, endoscopic monitor- ing should be carried out -if appropriate, after intensification of the anti-inflammatory therapy -within 3 -6m o n t h s . Evidence grade 2, recommendation grade B, consensusRECOMMENDATION 2.38 If there is evidence of an endoscopically nonresectable lesion with IEN/dysplasia or an adenocarcinoma, in view thestrong association with metachronous or synchronous carci-noma, a proctocolectomy should be performed.Evidence grade 2, recommendation grade A, strong consensus RECOMMENDATION 2.39 If polypoid lesions with dysplasia/IEN have been completely endoscopically resected and there is no evidence of dysplasiain the rest of the colon, colonoscopy at annual intervals can berecommended as a surveillance strategy.Expert consensus, recommendation open, consensus RECOMMENDATION 2.40 Following complete endoscop ic resection of non-polypoid lesions with dysplasia/IEN without evidence of dysplasia inthe rest of the colon, endosc opic surveillance should be performed annually.Expert consensus, recommendation, consensus RECOMMENDATION 2.41 If histologically confirmed IEN/dysplasia is detected by secondary diagnostic examination from endoscopically unre-markable areas, a new endosc opic examination should be performed by an examiner experienced in surveillance colo-noscopy, if possible using chromoendoscopy with high resolu- tion white light endoscopy (HDWLE). Expert consensus, recommendation, consensus RECOMMENDATION 2.42 If IEN/dysplasia is detected in endoscopically unremarkable areas, depending on the degree of dysplasia, endoscopic and bioptic surveillance should be carried out. If low-grade IEN isconfirmed, endoscopic/bioptic surveillance should be repeatedwithin 3 -6 months. Expert consensus, recommendation, consensus Alternatively, proctocolect omy can be discussed with the patient. If high-grade IEN is confirmed, a recommendationfor proctocolectomy should be given.

RECOMMENDATION 2.43 Polyps with dysplasia located proximal to the colon segments with anamnestically maximal ma croscopic or histologic UC activity are regarded as sporadic adenomas and should be en-doscopically resected if possible.Expert consensus, recommendation, consensus Background The detection of intraepithelial neoplasia (IEN) and its classifi- cation grade are of critical importance when assessing the colon carcinoma risk in patients with ulcerative colitis. In untargetedquadrant biopsies, IEN was postoperatively identified in 74 % ofcolectomy specimens with proven carcinoma, but also in 26 % ofcolectomy specimens without proven carcinoma [221]. Results ofa meta-analysis demonstrated that the carcinoma risk even inlow-grade IEN is increased 9-fold [ 197]. In patients with ulcerative colitis and evidence of IEN, the prev- alence of colon carcinoma is increased. A distinction is to be made between flat and polypoid lesions. If the colon is not in a predomi-nantly inflammation-free state, it may be difficult to differentiatebetween inflammatory changes and IEN, since their appearancecan be similar. Such lesions are generally classified as suspectedIEN. In this case, the intensification of anti-inflammatory therapywith short-term endoscopic monitoring seems appropriate. Onthe other hand, evidence of flat, high-grade IEN found in endo- scopically unremarkable areas bears a high risk of coincident carcinoma of between 42 -45 %, and proctocolectomy should therefore be performed [180, 193]. While flat, low-grade IEN may be a precursor to high-grade IEN or carcinomas, low-grade IEN may equally be an indicator of syn-chronous carcinoma. A meta-analysis showed that patients inwhom low-grade IEN is detected have a 9-fold increased risk ofcarcinoma development. However, there are a number of single studies which report that the risk for colitis-associated CRC development in patients with low-grade IEN is not, or is not signifi-cantly, increased [194, 197, 198]. A population-based study alsofound no increase in carcinoma development [196]. The presence of IEN, regardless of its grade, has been found to correlate with CRC development with a sensitivity and specificityof 74 %, while in the same study, it was shown that high-grade IENis a less sensitive (34 %) but considerably more specific (98 %) indi- cator of CRC [221]. In a meta-analysis, a 9-fold increased risk a increased risk ofadvanced neoplasia [197]. A recently-published systematic meta-analysis of cohort studies found low-grade IEN to be associatedwith an annual risk of 0.8 % for incidence of CRC and 1.8 % forincidence of advanced neoplasia. Factors significantly associatedwith progression of dysplasia concomitant PSC (OR 3.4),invisible dysplasia 1.9), distal localisation (OR 2.0) and multi- focal dysplasia (OR 3.5). Furthermore, synchronous CRC was detected in 17 % of patients who had undergone colectomy dueto low-grade IEN [222]. Individual studies which found noincreased risk of malignancy in patients with low-grade IEN shouldbe considered with the meta-analyses in mind [196]. The diagno-sis of low-grade IEN is therefore associated with a substantial risk of carcinoma and has consider able prognostic implications [194, 198, 223]. Hence, the evidence concerning low-grade IEN is controversial and regular 3 -6 monthly surveillance endoscopy with bioptic monitoring is considered a justifiable alternative to colectomy. Elevated lesions with IEN were originally classified as dysplasia- associated lesions or masses (DALM) [160]. The risk of CRC in thepresence of DALM was estimated to be very high [193]. However,since the classification of DALM can present difficulties andshowed inconsistencies, the term \"DALM \"was abandoned in the 2012 ECCO guidelines and replaced by the expression \"raised lesions with dysplasia (RLD) \"[189]. Such lesions may resemble sporadic adenomas, and can be endoscopically resected. If resection is histologically complete,and no IEN is detected either in the immediate vicinity or in theremainder of the colon, colectomy may not be necessary. Never-theless, these patients have a tendency to develop raised lesions(RLD) and should ther efore be closely monitored at short intervals [224 -226]. A meta-analysis of 10 studies including 376 patients indicated there to be a low risk of developing colorectal carcinoma following polyp resection. However, since the risk of renewed dys- plasia is increased approximately 10-fold in these patients, frequentmonitoring is required even after endoscopic resection [227]. Proctocolectomy is indicated in patients with non-resectable or adenocarcinoma, since both are strongly associat-ed with metachronous or synchronous carcinoma. In patients withcompletely resectable polypoid lesions with dysplasia/IEN, butwithout additional dys plasia in the remainder of the colon, screen- ing colonoscopy at yearly intervals is recommended for surveillance [157]. The same approach is advisable in patients with completelyresected non-polypoid lesions with dysplasia/IEN. If IEN/dysplasia iscoincidentally detected in an endoscopically unremarkable areaand confirmed by histological second opinion, a further monitoringendoscopy should be carried out, ideally by means of chromoen-doscopy with high definition white light endoscopy (HDWLE), byan examiner experienced in surveillance endoscopy. confirmed in an endo- scopically unremarkable area, endoscopic-bioptic monitoringshould be performed within three to six months. Alternatively,the possibility of proctocolectomy may be considered. On theother hand, in patients with confirmed high-grade intraepithelialneoplasia found in endoscopically unremarkable areas, a recom-mendation for proctocolectomy should be given [157]. Polyps with dysplasia which occur proximal to the segments af- fected by colitis are regarded as sporadic adenomas and should be endoscopically resected if possible. RECOMMENDATION 2.44 In patients additionally diagnosed with PSC, ursodeoxycholic acid can be given as a prophylaxis against colitis-associated carcinoma.Evidence grade 2, recommendation grade 0, consensus 179 Kucharzik T et al. Updated S3-Guideline Ulcerative ...Z Gastroenterol 2019; 57: 162 -241 This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. Background Long-term therapy with 5-ASA should be offered to patients with ulcerative colitis as a prophylactic therapy for prevention ofcarcinoma (see also 3.18). In patients additionally diagnosedwith PSC, ursodeoxycholic acid has been shown in a prospective, placebo-controlled follow-up study (PSC-UDCA study) to reduce the risk of colon carcinoma by 74 % [228]. A cross-sectional analy-sis from a prospective surveillance study had previously indicateda considerable risk reduction [229]. On the other hand, in a pro-spective randomised study in 2009, a slightly higher overall mor-tality rate was found in patients with PSC who received a high-dose ursodeoxycholic acid therapy (28 -30 mg/kg BW per day) [230]. On the basis of these data, treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid at a dose of 13 -20 mg/kg BW per day is recommended. 3. Treatment of active disease and remission maintenance therapy General therapeutic goals In patients with ulcerative colitis, active disease flares are character- ised by typical symptoms (bloody diarrhoea, tenesmus, imperativedefaecation urgency). The therapeutic approach is determined by acombination of factors including not only the intensity of symp-toms, but also the endoscopic localisation (proctitis, left-sided coli-tis, pancolitis), progressi on, response to previous therapy, disease duration, extraintestinal manifestations, concomitant illnesses and patient preferences. Individual treatment optionsshould be discussed and agreed with the patient. Especially whenweighing up outpatient vs. inpatient treatment, due considerationshould be given to its practicability for both doctor and patient. STATEMENT 3.0 The primary therapeutic aim for ulcerative colitis is to rapidly induce clinical remission and to maintain long-term steroid-free clinical and endoscopic remission.Expert consensus, strong consensus RECOMMENDATION 3.1 Anti-inflammatory therapy should be initiated only after ob- jective evidence of inflammatory activity has been obtained.Expert consensus, recommendation, strong consensus Background All available anti-inflammatory therapies are aimed at influen- cing inflammatory activity, which thus represents the conditio sine qua non in the pharmacological treatment of ulcerative colitis. The severity of symptoms as described by the patient is often poorlycorrelated with the extent of objectively detectable inflammationas assessed by biomarkers, endos copy or sonography, especially in disease of longer duration, where symptoms have been describedto overlap with those of irritable bowel syndrome. Therefore, an in-crease in clinical activity is not necessarily caused by inflammation. RECOMMENDATION 3.2 Following successful treatment of an acute disease flare, all pa- tients should receive long-term remission maintenance therapy. Expert consensus, recommendation, strong consensus Background On the evidence of remission rates seen in the placebo groups of extensive studies, which reflect the spontaneous course of diseasein patients with ulcerative colitis, most patients will relapse within12 months of the previous flare. Therefore, the remission rate after12 months is frequently < 50 %. Long-term therapy with mesalazine,thiopurines or biologics increases t he likelihood of sustained remis- sion [231 -233]. The probability of prolonged remission is higher in patients who have attained deep clinical and endoscopic remission, as shown by retrospective analyses of data from the ACT-1 andACT-2 trials in patients with ulcerative colitis receiving infliximabtherapy [78, 234]. A positive correlation has been shown betweendeep remission as indicated by mucosal healing and the clinicalcourse of disease [78, 79]. Nevertheless, it has yet to be determinedwhether drug-induced mucosal healing in the sense of a \"treat to target \"strategy actually influences disease progression, or whether patients who achieve mucosal healing simply represent a subgroup of patients with a milder disease course. STATEMENT 3.3 The choice and duration of the appropriate acute and remis- sion maintenance therapy depends on the extent of disease, disease course (frequency and severity of flares), response to and side-effects of previous therapies, severity of the previousflare, the drug used to induce remission, the safety of theremission maintenance therapy, and the potential success ofdysplasia and cancer surveillance.Expert consensus, strong consensus RECOMMENDATION 3.4 The risks and benefits of drug therapies should be weighed up against surgical options.Expert consensus, recommendation, strong consensus 180 Kucharzik T et al. Updated S3-Guideline Ulcerative ...Z Gastroenterol 2019; 57: 162 -241Leitlinie This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. Therapy of uncomplicated ulcerative colitis Proctitis RECOMMENDATION 3.5 Mild to moderately active proctitis should initially be treated with mesalazine suppositories at a dose of 1000 mg/d once daily.Evidence grade 1, recommendation grade A, strong consensusMesalazine foam and mesalazine enema are consideredequivalent therapeutic alternatives.Evidence grade 2, strong consensus Background If ulcerative colitis activity is limited to the rectum, topical ther- apy with mesalazine is indicated. The effectiveness of topical mesa-lazine with regard to symptomatic, endoscopic and histologicresponse has been confirmed in numerous studies [235 -237]. A dose of 1 g/d, at a minimum, should be administered. Higher doseshave not been proven to bring additional benefit [238]. Suppositor-ies have shown advantages in terms of drug release and patienttolerability, and should therefore be preferred [239]. While the additional administration of oral mesalazine can be considered [240], there are no specific data available on patients with proctitis.In a single study of patients with proctitis, rectal administration ofmesalazine was found to be superior to oral therapy [241]. RECOMMENDATION 3.6 If monotherapy fails, rectal app lication of mesalazine should be combined with topical steroids or oral mesalazine-releas-ing preparations.Evidence grade 1, recommendation grade B, strong consensus Background If response is lacking, rectal mesalazine should be combined with topical steroids. However, two meta-analyses demonstrated rectal mesalazine application to be more effective than topical steroids [242, 243]. A combination of beclomethasone dipropio-nate (3 mg) and 2 g mesalazine enemas was found to be superiorto either preparation alone [244]. Furthermore, results of a rando-mised trial demonstrated that 2 g budesonide rectal foam wasmore effective than placebo in patients with mild to moderateproctosigmoiditis [245], both alone and in combination with amesalazine preparation [246]. A direct comparison with mesala- zine is, however, lacking. For this disease localisation, intake of mesalazine granules appears beneficial [247]. Should the above outlined the rapies remain unsuccessful, therapy adherence should be verified, the endoscopic severityconfirmed and, if required, the therapeutic principles of more ex-tensive severe ulcerative colitis applied. An additional therapeuticpossibility is the rectal application of tacrolimus, which small trialshave found to be efficacious [248, 249]. However, this therapy should be administered in centres with appropriate experience.Left-sided colitis RECOMMENDATION 3.7 Mild to moderate left-sided ulcerative colitis should initially be treated with rectal mesalazine in the form of enemas or foam(1 g/d) in combination with oral mesalazine-releasing preparations ( 3g / d ) . Evidence grade 1, recommendation grade B, strong consensus RECOMMENDATION 3.8 Rectal application of mesalazine enemas or foams ( 1g / d ) should be pr eferred to topical steroid therapy. Evidence grade 2, recommendation grade A, strong consensus RECOMMENDATION 3.9 Oral mesalazine-releasing preparations should preferably be administered in a single daily dose.Evidence grade 2, recommendation grade B, strong consensus Background First-line therapy of mild to moderate left-sided ulcerative colitis should consist of a combination of oral and rectal mesalazine pre-parations, since combined therapy has been demonstrated not only to be more effective than oral therapy alone, but also to take effect more rapidly [250]. Both oral and rectal mesalazine applica-tions have been shown to be more effective than placebo [235,237, 250]. Therefore, if rectal application is not tolerated, oral ther-apy alone may be considered, the effectiveness of which has beenconfirmed in various studies. Topical application achieves a higherrectal active drug concentration [251]. Response rates for enemasor foams have not been found to differ significantly [252]. Oral mesalazine is not more effective than oral sulphasalazine, but it is associated with fewer side-effects [253]. There appears to be nosignificant difference in the effects of the various mesalazinepreparations [253, 254]. While the optimal daily dose may dependon the choice of preparation, it is important to ensure that the cho-sen dosage is sufficiently high ( 3 g/d) [253]. In left-sided colitis, the rectal application of beclomethasone dipropionate seems tobe as effective as topical mesalazine, as a meta-analysis confirmed [255]. Rectally-administered budesonide foam has also been shown to be effective for the induction of remission [245]. Therapy adher-ence is an important consideration, especially with respect tomesalazine therapies, since a significant proportion of patientswho fail to respond do so as a result of inadequate intake [256].When prescribing, it should be kept in mind that mesalazine pro-ducts are available in a range of different dosing options and withdiffering galenic characteristics (once daily dosing; tablets or pel- lets/granules). High-dose mesalazine once daily is not inferior to multiple daily doses [257, 258]. The importance of topical applica-tions should be discussed with the patient. 181 Kucharzik T et al.

RECOMMENDATION 3.10 If the symptoms of ulcerative colitis do not respond to the thera- pies discussed under 3.5 -3.9, systemic steroid therapy should be initiated (0.5 -1 mg/kg BW/d prednisolone equivalent). Evidence grade 1, recommendation grade A, strong consensus Budesonide MMX 9 mg/d should be administered to patientswith mild to moderately active left-sided ulcerative colitis whoshow inadequate response, or are intolerant, to mesalazine-releasing preparations. Evidence grade 1, recommendation grade B, strong consensus Background The necessity for oral steroid therapy in patients with mild to moderately active ulcerative colitis depends not only on the clinicalresponse to, and tolerance of, mesalazine therapies, but also on thewishes of the patient and the physician 's judgment; there is no clear defining line. The median time until cessation of rectal bleeding at a dosage of 4.8 g mesalazine/d has been demonstrated to be 9 days, whereby stable remission was achieved only after a therapy dura-tion of 37 -45 days [259]. Therefore, oral steroid therapy should be initiated if clinical symptoms worsen during therapy or if bleed-ing persists for more than 14 days. While studies have shown bude-sonide MMX to be effective, oral budesonide without MMX galenicis ineffective in patients with ulcerative colitis [260]. In the Core Itrial, the effectiveness of budesonide MMX was found to be equiva- lent to that of 2.4 g Asacol [261], while the Core II trial showed 9 mg budesonide MMX to be significantl y more effective than placebo [262]. A pooled analysis of the Core I and Core II studies concludedthat intake of 9 mg budesonide MMX was particularly beneficial forpatients with mild or moderately active disease, and also forpatients with left-sided colitis [263]. A further study showed theeffectiveness of the additional administration of budesonide MMXin patients with inadequate response to mesalazine. In this situa- tion, therefore, budesonide MMX may be considered as an addi- tional therapy. A direct comparison with conventional steroids hasnot been performed. In the pivotal trials prior to drug approval,budesonide was found to have a good safety profile, with long-term safety data similar to those seen in the placebo groups. Extensive disease RECOMMENDATION 3.11 In patients with extensive disease, mild to moderate ulcera- tive colitis should initially be treated with an oral-release mesalazine preparation at a dose of 3 g/d in combination with mesalazine enemas or foams.Evidence grade 1, recommendation grade A, strong consensus RECOMMENDATION 3.12 Systemic steroid therapy (0.5 -1 mg/kg BW/d prednisolone equivalent) should be initiated if symptoms of ulcerativecolitis fail to respond to the therapies described in 3.5 -3.9 and 3.11 or if a severe form of colitis is present at diagnosis.Evidence grade 1, recommendation grade A, strong consensus Background The therapeutic principles in extensive, mild to moderately active ulcerative colitis essentially correspond to those applied in left-sidedcolitis; most studies include both patterns of involvement. The superior effectiveness of a combination of oral and topical mesalazine therapy compared to oral monotherapy has beendemonstrated in a randomised study [1]. As with left-sided colitis,sulphasalazine is equally but associated with more side-effects [253]. Once-daily dosing has been found to be equallyeffective, independent of the formulation [254, 258]. It should beensured that dosage is sufficiently high ( 3 g/d) [253]. In patients who show insufficient response to mesalazine maintenance therapy, steroid therapy should be initiated. There a r en os p e c i f i cc r i t e r i aw i t hr e g a r dt od i s e a s es e v e r i t y ,e x t e n t ,o rtime to response. If the patient is already receiving immunosup-pressive therapy, it is necessary to adapt steroid therapy depend-ing on the medication history. The results of two studies indicatethat in extensive colitis (unlike left-sided colitis), additionaltherapy with 9 mg budesonide MMX was not superior to placebo[263]. Remission maintenance in primarily uncomplicated ulcerative colitis RECOMMENDATION 3.13 Mesalazine should be applied as first-line maintenance therapy if the patient shows a response to either mesalazine or steroids. Evidence grade 1, recommendation grade A, strong consensus Background There is strong evidence supporting the use of mesalazine for maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis. According to a recentmeta-analysis of 42 studies and a total of 8928 patients, oral mesa- lazine is significantly more effective than placebo for maintenanceof remission in terms of both clinical and endoscopic criteria [253].Similar findings were demonstrated for rectal application of mesa- lazine in an additional meta-analysis, the remission rate after 12 months being significantly higher than in the placebo group[265]. Rectal mesalazine was shown to be particularly effective indistal ulcerative colitis. However, adherence to rectal therapy isvery variable [266]. To date, there is no scientific evidence for a better therapy than mesalazine for maintenance of remission after response to eithersteroids or mesalazine [267]. Trials comparing mesalazine to thio- purines or biologics for maintenance of remission are lacking. Therefore, due to its more favourable side-effect profile, werecommend the administration of mesalazine as primary therapyin the situation described above. 182 Kucharzik T et al. Updated S3-Guideline Ulcerative ...Z Gastroenterol 2019; 57: 162 -241Leitlinie This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. Although its effectiveness has now been proven in three con- trolled studies, there are far fewer data for E. coli Nissle in compar- ison to mesalazine, as a result of which there is no consensus for its use as primary therapy. A meta-analysis of 4 randomised, con-trolled, blinded studies revealed no difference between mesala-zine and E. coli Nissle for maintenance of remission [268]. Furtherstudies are required to increase the pool of evidence and betterdefine the position of E. coli Nissle in the therapeutic algorithm,especially in comparison to mesalazine [269]. RECOMMENDATION 3.14 The application route of mesalazine should be chosen accord- ing to the disease pattern. Proctitis and left-sided colitisshould primarily be treated using rectal preparations.Evidence grade 1, recommendation grade A, strong consensus Background Oral intake has been evaluated for all preparations. Conversely, the different rectal applicatio ns (suppositories, rectal foam, enema) have only been studied for mesalazine. In distal UC, rectalapplication of mesalazine has been shown to be superior not onlyto placebo [236, 265] but also to topical steroids [242]. The com-bination of oral and rectal therapy is more effective than oralmonotherapy [270, 271]. In this combination, topical therapy can also be used intermittently [272]. Mesalazine formulations of the newer generation (e. g. multi-matrix formulations, granules),have a good release profile in the left-sided colon and are thusmore effective in this situation than older-generation formula-tions with ileal release [247, 273, 274]. Hence, these new formu-lations represent an alternative in patients with distal colitis andpoor therapy adherence. RECOMMENDATION 3.15 A combination of oral and rectal mesalazine should be used as second-line maintenance therapy.Evidence grade 1, recommendation grade A, strong consensusBackground Two controlled studies have demonstrated the superiority of a combination therapy (oral and rectal mesalazine) compared with oral mesalazine alone in maintenance therapy [270, 271] .In patients who relapse in spite of oral or rectal mesalazine mono-therapy, and whose acute episode is successfully treated with anoral-rectal combination therapy, the combination therapy shouldbe continued for the maintenance of remission thereafter. In thetwo studies cited above, however, rectal therapy was applied onlytwice a week at a dose of 8 g [270] and 2 g [271], respectively. Thus, both dosage and application interval differ from the dos- ages currently recommended for induction of remission. RECOMMENDATION 3.16 For maintenance therapy, mesalazine should be administered in dosages which have been de monstrated to be clinically effective ( Table 7 ). Evidence grade 1, recommendation grade A, strong consensusThe medication should pr eferably be administered in a single daily dose.Evidence grade 2, Recommendation grade A, strong consensusIn view of its more favourable side-effect profile and compar-able effectiveness, mesalazine should be preferred oversulphasalazine. Evidence grade 1, recommendation grade B, strong consensus Background As yet, no clear dose-efficacy relationship has been established for maintenance therapy with mesalazine. In a recent meta-analy-sis, daily intake of 1.2 g mesalazine was statistically no lesseffective in sustaining remission after 12 months than a dailydose of 2.4 g [253]. However, patients taking the higher dose remained in remission for longer (median 175 days) than those receiving 1.2 g (median 129 days). This disparity was even morepronounced in the subanalysis of patients with extensive dis ease (median remission 143 days for 2.4 g vs. 47 days for 1.2 g). How-ever, after 12 months, the difference was no longer significant.While a 2011 meta-analysis showed better results for mainte-nance therapy with a daily dose of 2 g mesalazine compared with < 2 g, the analysis included studies with a range of different mesalazine preparations (mesalazine, olsalazine, sulphasalazineTable 7 Mesalazine dosages proven to be effective in maintenance therapy. application dose comment oral monotherapy mesalazine 2 g/day [232] No clear dose-response relationship could be found in several studies; once-daily intake preferable [258, 274, 276, monotherapy mesalazine 1 g/day [280 -282] No dose-response relationship oral-rectal combination therapy intermitt. rectal mesalazine of 1 -4gtw i c e weekly; oral mesalazine daily 1.6 -3 g/day [284] 183 Gastroenterol 2019; 57: 162 -241 This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. and balsalazide) [232]. Likewise, a Cochrane analysis from 2016 identified a trend to better maintenance of remission under a dai-ly dose of 2 g/day [253]. In conclusion, a mesalazine dose of 2 g/day should be administered for maintenance of remission. However, it remains unclear wh ether patients who required a higher dose to achieve remission, or who relapsed more frequent- ly in the past, also require a higher dose to preserve remission. Onthe other hand, higher doses of mesalazine do not seem to beassociated with increased side effects [ 275]. Once daily dosing has been shown in several studies to be as effective as multiple daily dosing for maintenance therapy [258,274, 276 -279] and should therefore be preferred in view of the improved therapy adherence. Regarding the rectal administration of mesalazine, there are no data to suggest a dose-response rela- tionship. In most trials of rectal mesalazine (suppositories, monotherapy in adult patients , doses of 1 g/day were applied [280 -282] and found to be superior to placebo. In the context of oral-rectal mesalazine combination therapy, rectal mesalazinehas been demonstrated to be effective when administered twiceweekly at a dose of both 4 g [270] and 1 g, respectively [271]. A Cochrane analysis showed sulphasalazine to be more effective than other mesalazine preparations in maintenance therapy [253], whereby the difference was marginal (odds ratio 1.1; 95 % CI 1.03 - 1.27). Moreover, no significant difference was found in the side-effect profile of sulphasalazine compared with the other mesalazinepreparations, which stands in contrast to clinical routine. Sincemost studies included patients already receiving sulphasalazinetherapy, however, a selection bias cannot be excluded. RECOMMENDATION 3.17 If effective, maintenance therapy with mesalazine should be continued for at least 2 years.Evidence grade 2, recommendation grade B, strong consensus Background Few data exist concerning the value of long-term maintenance therapy in comparison to a simple surveillance approach. A con-trolled study of 112 patients revealed that in patients who havebeen in remission for one to two years, continued mesalazine ther-apy over 12 months can reduce the likelihood of relapse comparedwith placebo [285]. Patients in remission for longer than 2 years didnot benefit from an additional 12 months 'mesalazine therapy. However, for methodical and statistical reasons (necessary group sizes for full statistical power), the results of this analysis cannotbe taken as a definitive indication of the value of mesalazine ther-apy for maintenance of remission in patients who have been inr e m i s s i o nf o ro v e r2y e a r s .F u r t h e r m o r e ,t h ed o s a g eu s e d( 1 . 2 gmesalazine) is not in accordance with current guidelines. In rare cases, mesalazine can lead to nephrotoxicity. Upon enquiry, 118 English and 45 international IBD centres reported 151 cases of diagnosed kidney damage, which occurred at an average of 3 years after therapy initiation. A genetic dispositionwas identified [286]. Although there is no evidence-based recom-mendation concerning the timepoint or subsequent intervals atwhich kidney parameters should be determined during long- term therapy, monitoring at 6- to 12-monthly intervals has beensuggested [287]. It should be kept in mind that therapy adherence in patients receiving long-term mesalazine therapy is especially poor, at only around 50 % [288]. RECOMMENDATION 3.18 Patients with ulcerative coli tis should be offered long-term therapy with mesalazine from the perspective of carcinoma prevention. Evidence grade 2, recommendation grade B, consensus Background A number of cohort and case-control studies have confirmed that both sulphasalazine and mesalazine are associated with areduced risk of colorectal cancer in patients with ulcerative colitis[181, 289]. An analysis of risk factors for CRC in ulcerative colitis by Velayos [181] showed a statistically significant chemopreven- tive effect of mesalazine against the development of colorectalcarcinoma. The chemopreventive effect of mesalazine in ulcera-tive colitis is not limited to hig h-risk patients [158, 192, 290]. The recommendation for long-term chemoprevention thereforeapplies to all ulcerative colitis patients except those with isolatedproctitis [101, 158, 178, 190, 192, 290 -298]. By suppressing mucosal inflammation, immunosuppressive drugs such as azathioprine can theoretically also exert an anticar- cinogenic effect. The same applies to MTX and anti-TNF. However,the evidence is not conclusive [178, 181, 190, 229, 291, 299 - 302], even though an observational cohort study of the CESAMEgroup provides evidence that patients on long-term azathioprinetherapy presented with a tendency towards a lower risk of colo-rectal carcinoma [303]. In conclusion, there is insufficientevidence to support a recommendation for thiopurines for chemoprevention in patients with ulcerative colitis. RECOMMENDATION 3.19 In case of relapse, the therapy for maintenance of remission should be escalated.Evidence grade 2, recommendation grade A, strong consensus RECOMMENDATION 3.20 Options for a stepwise escalation of therapy for maintenance of remission are a dose escalation of oral/rectal combinationtherapy with mesalazine (Evidence grade 1, recommendationgrade A), anti-TNF therapy (Evidence grade 1, recommenda- tion grade A), therapy with vedolizumab (Evidence grade 1, recommendation grade A) or therapy with thiopurines (Evi-dence grade 2, recommendation grade B).Strong consensus 184 Kucharzik et al. Updated S3-Guideline Ulcerative ...Z Gastroenterol 2019; 57: 162 -241Leitlinie This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. Background If relapse occurs while the patient is on maintenance therapy, options for therapy escalation should be considered. Although therange of drug therapies available to treat patients with ulcerative colitis has increased, and although certain drugs offer possibilities for combination therapies, there are still only a limited number ofeffective therapies. Therefore, the available therapies should beapplied using the optimal dosage and at optimal dosing intervals.Alongside the dose escalation of existing therapy with mesalazine,therapies with thiopurines, TNF antibodies and vedolizumabincluding dose/interval adjustments offer additional options forescalation. Prior therapies, as well as any intolerances and comor- bidities, should be considered when choosing the appropriate es- calation strategy. Studies co mparing immunosuppression with defined (optimised) basic therapies, or comparing the individualsubstance groups, are lacking, neither are there any formal esca-lation studies. In the absence of direct comparative studies, the most effective therapeutic strategy remains unclear. Furtherinformation concerning the use of thiopurines, TNF-antibodiesand vedolizumab can be found in the chapter on maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis with complicated disease progres- sion (recommendations 3.33 -3.34). RECOMMENDATION 3.21 Corticosteroids should not be used for maintenance therapy. Evidence grade 1, recommendation grade A, strong consensus Background There is no evidence to support the efficacy of either topical [304] or systemic corticosteroids [305] in maintenance therapy.Due to the hormonal character of steroids, severe adverse effectssuch as osteoporosis and cataract occur frequently during long-term therapy. In addition, corticosteroids as monotherapy -and in particular as part of a combination therapy -have been associated with a risk of severe infectious complications [306]. Complicated forms of disease progression in ulcerative colitis/severe ulcerative colitis RECOMMENDATION 3.22 Patients with a severe acute flare of ulcerative colitis should be hospitalised for treatment. Evidence grade 1, recommendation grade B, strong consensus Treatment should be administered in close cooperation withan interdisciplinary team including an experienced abdominalsurgeon.Evidence grade 3, recommendation grade B, strong consensus Background Severe ulcerative colitis can be defined using the well-estab- lished criteria Truelove and Witts [83, include:Severe diarrhoea with 6 or more macroscopically bloody stools per day, Fever (with an average evening temperature of over 37.5 \u00b0C or a temperature > 37.8 \u00b0C on at least 2 out of 4 days), Tachycardia with a pulse > 90/min, anaemia with a haemoglo- bin < 75 % of the normal value and ESR > 30 mm/h. These parameters define, in principle, systemic disease activity, which is usually also directly reflected in the patient 'sc l i n i c a lc o n - dition. Such patients are severely ill. The use of scoring systemsplays a mostly confirmatory role in clinical practice and is notmandatory. Generally, however, patients s hould be closely moni- tored for signs of systemic disease manifestation. Paediatric patients should be assessed using the PUCAI score [85]. Compo-nents of the PUCAI score are rectal bleeding,stool consistency, stool frequency, nocturnal defaecation, andlimitation of activity (total score between 0 -85). A PUCAI of > 65 points indicates a severe colitis flare. It is vitally important to make an accurate diagnosis at an early stage and to rule out intestinal infections [308]. Severe ulcerative colitis remains to this day a life-threatening condition, althoughthe mortality rate lies by < 1 % in s pecialised centres [84]. These patients therefore require hospitalisation. A meta-analysis investi-gating the response rate of patients with severe ulcerative colitisto corticosteroid therapy found a mean colectomy rate of 27 %and a mortality rate of 1 % [309]. In patients aged > 60 years,hospitalisation is particularly important, since their mortality in this situation has been shown to be increased [310]. Conventional therapy RECOMMENDATION 3.23 Patients with a severe flare of ulcerative colitis should be treated with systemic steroids (e. g. 1 mg/kg BW prednisoloneequivalent per day). Evidence grade 2, recommendation grade A, strong consensus RECOMMENDATION 3.24 Patients with a severe acute flare should receive prophylactic treatment to prevent thrombosis.Evidence grade 3, recommendation grade B, strong consensus RECOMMENDATION 3.25 The response to systemic steroid therapy should be evaluated on the basis of clinical symptoms and objective parameters.Evidence grade 4, recommendation grade B, strong consensus 185 Kucharzik T et al.

Background Since the middle of the last century, steroids have been the standard therapy in this situation [83, 311 -315]. Based on a number of studies, a dose of 1 mg prednisolone/kg BW/day isrecommended, whereas higher doses have not been shown to increase effectiveness [316]. A treatment duration of less than three weeks has been associated with an increased relapse rate.Furthermore, dosages below 15 mg prednisolone/day are ineffec-tive [311]. While, in principle, either oral or intravenous therapycan be administered, the latter s hould be favoured in patients with substantially disrupted motility. Response to steroid therapyshould be assessed according to objective parameters includingstool frequency, blood in the stool, haemoglobin level, ultras ound findings, endoscopic findings, CRP, blood count and faecal neutrophil markers. In case of contraindications or intolerance to steroids, therapy with infliximab, ciclosporin or tacrolimus may be considered.Since the majority of studies of these substances have beencarried out in steroid-refractory patients, these data will be moreclosely examined in that section. In patients who do not respond to steroids, the possibility of therapy escalation or a switch of therapeutic strategy needs prompt consideration (after approximately three days). This isvitally important, since studies have demonstrated that treatmentwith non-effective drugs including steroids not only results inincreased morbidity, but also in delayed surgery [317 -320]. The required treatment goes far beyond pharmacological ther- apy and can only be guaranteed if the patient is hospitalised, sincein addition to drug therapy, prior general and specific measures may be necessary. These include close monitoring of laboratory parameters, microbiological ex aminations (question regarding travel history), physio- and/or psychotherapeutic care and bloodtransfusions [321].In addition, the following measures may be required:1. parenteral fluid and electrolyte replacement. In particular, hypokalaemia and hypomagnesaemia should be avoided, sinceboth conditions promote intestinal hypomotility and thus increase the risk of toxic megacolon [322]. 2. discontinuation of all motility-inhibiting and otherwise poten- tially mucosa-damaging drugs, since these also therisk of toxic megacolon [6, 323 -325]. 3. sigmoidoscopy for confirmation of diagnosis and, at the sametime, extraction of biopsies to rule out intestinal CMV-reactivation(together with the systemic CMV virus load). This is particularlyimportant in patients with steroid-refractory disease; relevant CMV replication should be treated in this situation [326 -331]. 4.exclusion of Clostridium (C.) difficile infection, which occurs frequently in patients with severe ulcerative colitis and has beenassociated with increased mortality and morbidity [52, 310, 332 - 337]. Patients in whom Clostridium difficile is detected should betreated according to the DGVS guideline (see Chapter 4) [338]. Itis not clear whether immunosuppressive therapy should bestopped in this case, since the data are conflicting [339, 340]. 5. prophylactic administration of low molecular heparin to pre- vent thrombosis, since the risk of thrombosis is distinctly in-creased during an acute flare, regardless of other risk factors[337, 341 -344].6. initiation of nutrition therapy in patients with malnutrition. The enteral route should be favoured, as it is associated with fewercomplications (9 versus 35 %) [345] and the parenteral route isnot associated with better outcomes [346]. In children up to 16 years of age, the risk of hospitalisation due to a severe colitis flare is 30 -40 %, and thus higher than in adults. Children and adolescents should be treated with methylpredniso-lone once daily at a dose of 1 -2 mg/kg BW/d i. v. (maximum 40 - 60 mg/d) [309]. Approximately 30 -40 % of paediatric patients with severe ulcerative colitis fail to respond to the initial therapyand require therapy escalation with infliximab or ciclosporin. Inpatients with a PUCAI score of over 45 points on day 3 of i. v. ster- oid therapy, further diagnostic examinations (including sigmoido- scopy with exclusion of CMV colitis) should be performed and atherapy escalation prepared. If the PUCAI is > 65 points on day 5,therapy should be escalated, since these patients are unlikely torespond. As an alternative, colectomy s hould always be discussed with the parents and the patien t. For the treatment of severe acute episodes in children and adolescents, separate guidelineshave been issued by ECCO (the European Crohn 's and Colitis Orga- nization) and ESPGHAN (the and Nutrition) [347]. Ulcerative colitis refractory to systemic steroid therapy RECOMMENDATION 3.26 Patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis who fail to re- spond adequately to systemic steroids, or who have contraindi- cations or intolerances, should be treated with TNF antibodies (Evidence grade 2, recommendation grade B) or with ciclospor-in A (Evidence grade 1, recommendation grade B) or tacrolimus(Evidence grade 2, recommendation grade B). Infliximab, ifused, should preferably be given as combination therapy with athiopurine (Evidence grade 2, recommendation grade B). Proc-tocolectomy should also be considered in therapeutic decision-making (Evidence grade 5, recommendation grade B). Strong consensus RECOMMENDATION 3.27 Patients with ulcerative colitis who have fulminant disease activity refractory to therapy with intravenous steroids shouldbe treated with infliximab (preferably in combination with a thiopurine) (Evidence grade 2, recommendation grade B) or with ciclosporin A (Evidence grade 1, Recommendation gradeB) or tacrolimus (Evidence grade 2, recommendation gradeB). Proctocolectomy should also be considered (Evidencegrade 5, recommendation grade B).Strong consensus 186 Kucharzik T et Updated S3-Guideline Ulcerative ...Z Gastroenterol 2019; 57: 162 -241Leitlinie This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. RECOMMENDATION 3.28 In patients whose clinical cond ition deteriorates under the above-outlined (3.27) therapies, proctocolectomy should beperformed (Evidence grade 4, recommendation grade B).Proctocolectomy may also be indicated if there is no clinicalimprovement after 4 -7 days. Strong consensus Background If ulcerative colitis takes a steroid-refractory course, infectious causes such as C. difficile or cytomegalovirus should be excluded(see Chapter 4). Intravenous steroid therapy has been shown to bemore effective in confirmed ulcerative colitis refractory to oralsteroids, e. g., in a retrospective study of 110 patients [348, 349].However, almost half of the patients in this study went on todevelop steroid-dependent disease. TNF antibodies have beenclearly shown to be effective in the induction of steroid-free remission in patients with steroid-dependent disease who were taking steroids at study baseline (see comment on recommenda-tion 3.29) [350 -3 5 3 ] .I nt h es a m es t u d i e s ,t h ee f f e c t i v e n e s so f TNF antibodies was also shown in patients with steroid-refractorydisease in relation to various endpoints. Although there were lim-its on steroid intake at study begin and the proportion of patientson steroid therapy was documented, some patients may not havebeen receiving optimally dosed steroids at baseline. Furthermore, it is not always possible to differentiate steroid-refractory from steroid-dependent disease and to analyse data from these groupsseparately. Various TNF antibodies known to be effective in UC cantherefore be used in patients with a steroid-refractory diseasecourse. In clinical practice, the choice of TNF antibodies in ster-oid-refractory disease largely depends on disease activity. Inpatients with less active disease, and therefore less need for fastimprovement, a range of TNF antibodies including infliximab, ada- limumab und golimumab can be applied, whereas only infliximab and calcineurin inhibitors have undergone controlled trials inpatients with a fulminant disease manifestation. Since there areno uniform criteria for the differentiation of disease activity, thisis ultimately subject to individual clinical estimation. In the lastfew years, patients with fulmina nt steroid-refractory disease have been the focus of numerous controlled studies, which willbe discussed in detail below. However, assessing the response or non-response to therapy, and making a timely decision for or against a surgical approach, remains challenging. A number offactors can assist in clinical appraisal, the importance of whichmay be described as follows: In the clinical evaluation, a stool fre-quency of > 12/day after 2 days 'therapy with intravenous steroids has been found to correlate with a proctocolectomy rate of 55 %[354]. The Oxford Criteria, that have to be evaluated on day three,associate a stool frequency of > 8/day, or 3 -8/day together with a CRP > 45 mg/L, with a proctocolectomy rate of 85 % during the hospital stay [355]. With regard to laboratory parameters, a pro-spective study of 67 patients showed that an ESR > 75 mm/h or abody temperature of > 38 \u00b0C at presentation is associated with a5- to 9-fold increased risk of proctocolectomy [ 356]. Radiologicalappraisal should focus on data which are still relevant in contem- porary clinical practice. These include a colon dilatation > 5.5 cmas measured in an abdominal scan, which is associated with aproctocolectomy rate of 75 % [354]. In accordance with this, a ret- rospective study showed that evidence of ileus is associated with a proctocolectomy rate of 74 % [357]. Data pertaining to endo- scopic evaluation as a predictive marker for disease progressionare limited to small case series [71, 358]. Since the most pro-nounced lesions in ulcerative colitis are located in the distal colon,evaluation by means of sigmoidoscopy is sufficient [359]. Ineveryday practice, it is important to assess the overall picture.Retrospective data show that deep ulceration, steroid refractorydisease, colon dilatation and hypoalbuminaemia (< 30 g/dL) are major predictors (85 %) of the necessity for proctocolectomy [360]. Options for drug therapy include the following:Antibiotics Two studies have addressed the question of whether additional antibiotic therapy should be given. In one ofthese studies, in which antibiotic therapy in 30 patients withulcerative colitis was investigated in an open-label design, a two-week therapy with amoxicillin, tetracycline and metronidazole appeared to be effective in steroid-refractory ulcerative colitis [361]. In contrast, an earlier randomised, placebo-controlledstudy of 39 patients with severe ulcerative colitis found no effectfor metronidazole and tobramycin [362]. Ciclosporin The effectiveness of ciclosporin in this situation has been demonstrated in several st udies. Historically, the first randomised and placebo-controlled trial, still using a dose of4 mg/kg BW/day i. v., reported a rapid effect of ciclosporin A in the treatment of steroid-refractory ulcerative colitis [363]. While the small population size of 20 patients is a considerable limita-tion, 9 of 11 patients responded to ciclosporin therapy comparedwith 0 of 9 in the placebo group [363]. Later, the randomised,double-blinded study of d 'Haens and colleagues sought to dis- cover whether ciclosporin A can present an alternative to corticos-teroid therapy. 30 patients with severe ulcerative colitis were treated with either 40 mg methy lprednisolone/day or 4 mg/kg BW/day ciclosporin A i. v.. After 8 days, treatment response was recorded in 8/15 patients of th e methylprednisolone group and in 9/14 patients of the ciclosporin A group [364]. A 4 mg/kg BW/day with 2 mg/kg BW/day ciclospor-in and found no difference in response on day 8 [365]. Althoughnot all patients showed a steroid-refractory disease course atbaseline, 2 mg/kg BW has now been established as the standarddose. In the study, serum trough levels were measured and the ciclosporin concentrations adjusted as appropriate. While optimal therapeutic serum trough levels have not been defined, levelsbetween 250 and 400 ng/mL should be targeted, with doseadjustment based on trough level measurements. Both of the lar-gest and most recent studies confirm these results. In the Frenchstudy, 115 patients with steroid-refractory ulcerative colitis wererandomised to receive ciclosporin (2 mg/kg BW) or infliximab[366]. Aim of the study was to demonstrate that infliximab is not inferior to ciclosporin, the primary endpoint being therapy failure at day seven. The data indicate that ciclosporin is not more effec-tive than infliximab. Likewise, the CONSTRUCT study comparedciclosporin (2 mg/kg BW) with infliximab in 135 steroid-refractory Ulcerative ...Z Gastroenterol 2019; 57: 162 -241 This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. patients and found no evidence of inferiority for infliximab [367]. The proctocolectomy rate in this study was 25 % during hospitali-sation, 30 % within 3 months and 45 % within the first year [367].These current data are not included in the metaanalysis from2005, making its conclusion tha t ciclosporin is not superior to the standard therapy, corticosteroids, practically untenable [368]. Nevertheless, the side effects associated with ciclosporinlimit its use in everyday clinical practice. The sum of the evidence from the various controlled and uncon- trolled studies indicates that ciclosporin therapy can, at least in theshort term, prevent proctocolectomy in 76 -85 % of patients [363 -365, 369, 370]. In two studies including 76 and 142 patients treated with ciclosporin, 7-year proctocolectomy rates were 58 % and 88 %, respectively [371, 372]. Several analyses show that a transition from ciclosporin to thiopurine therapy significantlyreduces the risk of subsequent proctocolectomy [370 -373]. Tacrolimus Literature offering data on the use of tacrolimus is limited. A randomised, placebo-controlled trial compared twoserum concentrations, 5 -10 ng/mL and 10 -15 ng/mL, in ster- oid-refractory disease. While a dose-dependent efficacy was dem-onstrated, the study did not have the power to detect significant differences in patients with severe ulcerative colitis. Adverse events were particularly frequent in the high-dose group [374].The second study, similarly, is a randomised, placebo-controlledtrial over two weeks, which was able to demonstrate that oral ta-crolimus is significantly more effective than placebo in patientswith steroid-refractory ulcerative colitis [375]. A meta-analysisincluding both of these studie s came to the same conclusion [376]. A long-term prognosis regarding surgery is difficult to deduce, owing to the relatively small patient numbers. The proc- tocolectomy-free rates after 1, 3, 6 and 12 months were 86 %,84 %, 78 % and 69 %, respectively [376]. After 44 months, 57 % ofpatients had not undergone proctocolectomy. There are a num-ber of retrospective studies [377]. In a meta analysis, significantly higher rates of clinical response were found for tacrolimus com-pared to placebo (RR = 4.61, 95 % CI 2.09 -10.17, p = 0.00 015). Similar efficacy and safety data were reported from an open study of 100 patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis in which tacrolimus therapy was compared with an anti-TNF therapy [378].On the basis of these data and experience from clinical practice, itcan be concluded that tacrolimus presents a additional therapeu-tic alternative to steroid therapy. Infliximab Two randomised, double-blinded, placebo-con- trolled studies (ACT 1 and 2) initially demonstrated the overallefficacy of infliximab for the treatment of ulcerative colitis [350]. In the ACT I trial, 364 patients with moderately active ulcerative colitis, who had previously not responded to corticosteroids and/or immunomodulators, were treated. Sixty-nine per cent ofpatients treated with a dose of 5 mg/kg BW showed a clinicalresponse in week 8, compared to 61 % of patients who received10 mg/kg BW and 37 % of patients in the placebo group. Ratesof remission were 38.8 % (5 mg/kg BW infliximab), mg/kg BW infliximab) and 14.9 % (placebo). Infliximab can thus be administered at a dose of 5 mg/kg BW at weeks 0, 2, and 6. If effective, treatment should be continued at 8-weekly inter-vals thereafter as a maintenance therapy [350].For the treatment of steroid-refractory disease, infliximab was evaluated in a double-blind, randomised pilot study by J\u00e4rnerotand colleagues in 45 patients with severe ulcerative colitis whohad previously failed to respond to conventional steroid therapy[379]. In seven patients in the infliximab group and 14 patients in the placebo group, proctocolectomy was necessary within 3 months after randomisation (statistically significant difference).The proctocolectomy rate in this cohort after three years was 12/24 (50 %) in the infliximab group and 16/21 (76 %) in the placebogroup [380]. In a retrospective multicentre study of 211 patientswith steroid-refractory colitis treated with infliximab, the colect-omy rates were 36 %, 41 % and 46 % after 1, 3 and 5 years, respec-tively [381]. The two largest controlled studies comparing inflixi- mab with ciclosporin, the French trial and the CONSTRUCT study already cited above, indicated that infliximab is not inferior tociclosporin [366, 367]. Colectomy rates reported in the CON-STRUCT study for patients treated with infliximab were 21 %during the initial hospitalisation period, 29 % after 3 months and35 % after 12 months [367]. So which factors can serve as predictors? Patients with steroid- refractory disease who present with markedly increased CRP, levels, se antibodies (ANCAs) and severe endo-scopic lesions have a high risk of imminent relapse or proctoco-lectomy [ 382, 383]. Maintenance of proctocolectomy-free remis- sion is likely if there is a rapid response, mucosal healing and aninfliximab serum trough level > 2.5 \u00b5g/mL in week 14. Consistentwith this, a low serum trough level in week 6 (< 2.5 \u00b5g/mL) is anindicator of primary non-response [384]. What is the reason for low serum trough levels in patients with severe ulcerative colitis? It has been shown that inflixim ab is lost via the stool [385]. Although the induction schedule used in the CONSTRUCT studywith dosing in weeks 0, 2 and 6 has been adopted as standard, asmall retrospective study of 50 patients provided evidence thataccelerated induction may be associated with a reduced rate ofearly proctocolectomy [386]. In addition, thiopurine-na\u00efvepatients had better outcomes with regard to surgery [387]. Weighing up infliximab versus calcineurin inhibitors The 111 thiopurine-na\u00efve patients withsevere ulcerative colitis (Lichtiger Score > 10) in spite of a priorfive-day intravenous steroid therapy [366]. The patients were treat-ed either with ciclosporin (2 mg/kg BW for 8 days, \u00b5g/mL; by 4 o.) or infliximab (5 mg/kg BW at weeks 0, 2 and 6) [366]. All patientsshowing a response on day 8 received oral azathioprine and begansteroid tapering. The aim of the study was to demonstrate that ciclosporin therapy was associated with a lower rate of nonre- sponse. However, approximately 85 % of the patients in bothgroups showed a response to therapy on day 7. The treatment fail-ure rate at day 98 was 60 % in the ciclosporin group and 54 % in theinfliximab group (not significant). The proctocolectomy rate at day98 was 18 % in the ciclosporin group and 21 % in the infliximabgroup (not significant). In addition, no differences were foundregarding severe side-effects. Similarly, the aforementioned CON- STRUCT study, whose primary goal was to show that infliximab is 188 Kucharzik T et al. Updated S3-Guideline Ulcerative ...Z Gastroenterol 2019; 57: 162 -241Leitlinie This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. not inferior to ciclosporin, failed to reveal any significant differences between the two therapies in terms of quality of life or rates ofproctocolectomy, mortality or severe infections [367]. Consistentwith this, a meta-analysis including six retrospective studies showscomparable remission rates for patients with severe, steroid-refrac- tory ulcerative colitis treated with either ciclosporin or infliximab [388]. From an economic point of view, although infliximabpatients had a significantly shorter hospital stay and incurred lowerin-hospital costs, the total costs of therapy were higher [389]. Thus, there is no clear answer as to which of the substances should be used. This must be decided on an individual basis. Inpatients with low cholesterol and magnesium levels, ciclosporinis generally to be avoided due to the increased risk of neurological complications. In practice, the transition to maintenance therapy is easier in patients who respond to infliximab therapy. In the past,it has been argued that ciclosporin should be preferred becausethere are likely to be fewer complications in the event of surgery[390]. However, the evidence is based on a small case series andsince, as yet, there are insufficient data on infliximab, no certainconclusion can be drawn. Much more important as regards theoperational risk is the long-term use of steroids [391]. The next question is how to treat patients with steroid-refrac- tory disease who fail to respond, or lose response to either inflixi-mab or a calcineurin inhibitor. Is it then reasonable to try the otheroption? Most importantly, this is a situation in which surgicaloptions should be discussed in detail and offered for considera-tion. Controlled studies for thi s situation are lacking, and the published case series are not helpful [392]. Therefore, third-linetherapies should be administered, if at all, only in specialised centres, and in close consultation with the surgical partner. Complications Thromboembolic events occur more frequently during active disease, as already mentioned. Therefore, prophylactic anticoagu-lation is to be regarded as standard [341, 343]. Perforation duringan acute flare, whether it occurs spontaneously or during endo-scopic examination, is associated with a mortality rate of up to50 % [323]. A further complication is massive bleeding. Whentreating these seriously ill patients, it is critical not to miss the timepoint when conventional/drug therapy fails and surgical ther- apy (proctocolectomy) becomes necessary. Given the increasingnumber of therapeutic alternatives, the danger of delaying neces-sary surgical intervention is rather on the increase. Due to thisdilemma, gastroenterologists/paediatric gastroenterologists andsurgeons must cooperate closely, continually assessing togetherthe patient 's condition and response to therapy. Close patient monitoring is mandatory. Special situation: refractory proctitis Refractory proctitis is often clinically challenging. As a first step, dif-ferential diagnoses must be ruled out (HIV or chlamydia infection,irritable bowel syndrome, anatomic anomaly of the pelvic floor (pro-lapse), Crohn 's disease, carcinoma). Secondly, the adherence of the patient to oral and topical drug therapies must be reaffirmed, andreduced bowel motility should be ruled out [393]. Therapy is thenmanaged as described above for the classic refractory situation,even though hardly any studies have focused exclusively on procti- tis. A few small studies support the topical application of calcineurininhibitors (as enema or suppositories) [377, 394 -397]. Otherwise, the literature includes a number of uncontrolled studies which allowno general conclusions to be drawn. Critically, it should be noted that up to 10 % of patients who undergo coloproctectomy due to refractory colitis suffer from distal colitis only. RECOMMENDATION 3.29 In patients who respond to therapy with calcineurin inhibitors, azathioprine/mercaptopurine (Evidence grade 3, recommen- dation grade 0) or vedolizumab (Evidence grade 4, recom-mendation grade 0) therapy can be initiated. Patients whorespond to therapy with TNF antibodies should continue toreceive this therapy for maintenance of remission (Evidencegrade 1, recommendation grade A).Consensus Background In view of the high colectomy rate in patients receiving ciclos- porin or tacrolimus due to steroid-refractory disease progression,all patients should receive remission maintenance therapy, includ-ing those who are mesalazine-na\u00efve [363, 370, 398, 399]. Since,due to their frequent side-effects, calcineurin inhibitors shouldbe discontinued after 6 months at the latest, other substances,such as thiopurines, should be used for maintenance of remission. Retrospective analyses have shown thiopurines to reduce the risk of colectomy after induction of remission with ciclosporin [372,399]. An overlap of therapies is a dvisable, especially in thiopur- ine-na\u00efve patients, such that thiopurines are introduced as soonas a response or remission has been achieved with the calcineurininhibitor. After intravenous remission induction with ciclosporin,a bridging therapy with oral CsA can be administered untilazathioprine takes therapeutic effect. Lately, maintenance therapy with vedolizumab has been sug- gested as an alternative in patients who achieve remission withcalcineurin inhibitors but have azathioprine-refractory disease[400]. Therapy for maintenance of remission with TNF antibodiesfollowing appropriate induction of remission is discussed atlength under recommendation 3.34. Steroid-dependent ulcerative colitis RECOMMENDATION 3.30 Patients with steroid-dependen t ulcerative colitis should be treated with a thiopurine (Evidence grade 2) or TNF antibodies(Evidence grade 1) (in the case of infliximab, possibly combinedwith a thiopurine (Evidence grade 2)), or with vedolizumab(Evidence grade 2). Recommendation grade B, strong consensus 189 Kucharzik T et al. Updated S3-Guideline Ulcerative ...Z Gastroenterol 2019; 57: 162 -241 This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. Background The efficacy of thiopurines, TNF antibodies and vedolizumab in steroid-dependent ulcerative colitis has been assessed in variousstudies. A general recommendation for the choice of an appropri-ate therapy for steroid-dependent disease cannot be given, due to the lack of comparative studies. The choice of drug is contingent on a number of factors including disease activity, the age andcomorbidities of the patient, the potential side-effect profile, theclinical urgency for remission, the financial costs and the wishes ofthe patient. In steroid-dependent ulcerative colitis, azathioprine issignificantly more effective than mesalazine for maintaining clini-cal and endoscopic remission. In an open-label study, 72 patientsreceiving steroid therapy with 40 mg/d prednisolone were rando- mised to receive additional therapy 2 mg/kg/d or oral mesalazine 3.2 g/d [401]. Of the patients in the azathiopr-ine group, 53 % attained steroid-free clinical and endoscopicremission after 6 months, compared with 21 % of patients treatedwith mesalazine. In an open-label cohort study including 42 pa-tients receiving azathioprine therapy, steroid-free remission ratesof 55 %, 52 % and 45 % were reported after 12, 23 and 36 months,respectively [402]. The evidence provided by these studies thus confirms the effectiveness of thiopurines in patients with steroid- dependent ulcerative colitis. Steroid-free remission was a secondary endpoint of the large clinical studies of anti-TNF. In none of these studies, however, was a clear differentiation made between steroid-dependent andsteroid-refractory disease. The available data only show the proportion of patients treated with steroids during the therapy.Concerning infliximab, the ACT-1 and ACT-2 trials investigated 364 patients with endoscopically-confirmed ulcerative colitis and moderate to severe disease activity despite treatment with corti-costeroids and/or thiopurines ( ACT-1) or All patients wereanti-TNF-na\u00efve and were randomised to receive either placebo orinfliximab. At baseline, 56 % of patients were being treated withcorticosteroids, 38 % at a dose of at least 20 mg/d prednisoloneequivalent. Of those patients who took steroids at baseline, 21.5 % achieved steroid-free remission under infliximab at week 30, compared with 7.2 % under placebo (p = 0. 007) [350]. The ULTRA-2 study examined the effect of adalimumab in 494 patients with endoscopically-confirmed ulcerative colitis andmoderate to severe disease activity despite therapy with cortico-steroids and/or thiopurines. Patients were randomised to receiveplacebo or therapy with 160 mg adalimumab at week 0, 80 mg atweek 2, and 40 mg at 2-weekly intervals thereafter [351]. Fifty- nine per cent of patients were taking steroids at baseline, while 40 % had previously failed anti-TNF-therapy. Thirty-one per centof patients were steroid-free at week 16, but only 16 % of the pla-cebo group (p < 0.05). At week 52, 13.3 % of patients receivingadalimumab therapy who had been taking steroids at baselinewere in steroid-free remission, whereas this was true for only5.7 % under placebo (p = 0.035). The effectiveness of golimumab in patients with moderate to severely active ulcerative colitis despite prior therapy with steroid or mesalazine or thiopurines was investigated in the PURSUITtrials [352, 353]. All study partic ipants were anti-TNF-na\u00efve. In these studies, the induction phase was separated from the main-tenance of remission phase. The clinical response rate at week 6 was 51.0 % among patients treated with 200 mg and then100 mg golimumab, compared with 54.9 % in patients who hadreceived 400 mg and then 200 mg [352]. In the PURSUIT-M study,464 patients who responded to induction therapy were rando- mised again to receive remissi on maintenance therapy with golimumab or placebo. In the subgroup of patients takingsteroids at baseline, 34.4 % were in steroid-free remission undergolimumab at week 54, compared with 20.7 % in the placebogroup (p = 0.024) [353]. The above-described TNF antibodies are more effective than placebo in the induction and maintenance of steroid-free remis-sion in patients receiving steroid therapy at baseline. The usefulness of combination therapy with infliximab and azathioprine compared with infliximab or azathioprine alone wasevaluated the UC-SUCCESS study and mostlythiopurine-na\u00efve patients [403]. In this controlledtrial, a combination therapy with infliximab and azathioprine wasfound to be more effective than the monotherapies. At week 16,steroid-free remission was achieved by 39.7 % of patients receiv-ing combination therapy, compared with 22.1 % in the infliximab group and 23.7 % under azathioprine (p = 0.032). Corresponding data on the effectiveness of adalimumab and golimumab as a combination therapy are not available. For thesesubstances, the evidence indicates only that the production of au-toantibodies is inhibited under co-immunosuppression. However,it remains to be shown whether this leads to improved treatmentefficacy. Steroid-free remission was also a secondary endpoint of the GEMINI-1 trial. In this study, which evaluated the effect of vedoli- zumab in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis,374 patients were enrolled in a randomised induction phase fortreatment with vedolizumab or placebo. In an additional induc-tion arm, 521 patients were enrolled in an open-label cohort.Responders at week 6 from both cohorts were then (re-)rando-mised to maintenance therapy with vedolizumab or placebo[404]. All study participants were refractory to steroids and/or to thiopurines or an anti-TNF therapy. 53.7 % of the patients in the GEMINI-1 study were receiving steroid therapy at baseline, while 48 % had failed anti-TNF therapy.Of those patients who took steroids at baseline and responded toinduction therapy, 38.5 % of patients randomised to receive vedo-lizumab maintenance therapy were in steroid-free remission atweek 52, compared with 13.9 % of those receiving placebo(p < 0.001). The efficacy of vedolizumab therapy for both induc- tion and maintenance was independent of concomitant therapy with steroids or immunosuppressive medications, and also inde-pendent of prior anti-TNF therapy. Methotrexate (MTX) was recently the subject of a multicentre study of 111 patients with steroid-dependent ulcerative colitis[405]. The primary endpoint at week 16 was not reached, with31.7 % of patients in the MTX group compared with 19.6 % ofpatients in the placebo group reaching steroid-free remission (p = 0.15). The secondary endpoint, the proportion of patients with steroid-free clinical remission at week 16, was 41.7 % in the MTXgroup and 23.5 % in the placebo group (p = 0.04). Although theresults showed a clear trend towa rds a therapeutic response, cur- 190 Kucharzik T et Updated S3-Guideline Ulcerative ...Z Gastroenterol 2019; 57: 162 -241Leitlinie This document was downloaded for personal use only.

Therapy of patients with ulcerative colitis and inadequate response to thiopurine therapy RECOMMENDATION 3.31 Patients with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis who fail to respond adequately to thiopurine therapy should be treatedwith TNF antibodies (Evidence grade 1) (in the case of inflixi-mab, possibly in combination with thiopurines (Evidencegrade 2)) or with vedolizumab (Evidence grade 2).Recommendation grade B, strong consensus Background After infectious complications have been excluded, patients who fail immunosuppressive therapy should be treated withbiologics, provided there are no relevant contraindications. Inprinciple, a therapy with integrin antibodies can be administeredeven before TNF antibodies have been used. Infliximab, adalimu-mab, golimumab und vedolizumab have all been evaluated for the therapy of ulcerative colitis in patients refractory to thiopurines. Three hundred and thirty-four/728 (46 %) of patients enrolled in the ACT-1 and ACT-2 studies had active disease in spite ofimmunosuppressive therapy [350]. Under infliximab, regardlessof the dosage (5 or 10 mg), significantly more patients achievedclinical remission after 8 weeks compared to placebo. However,the response rate was not reported for the subgroup of patientswho were refractory to immunosuppressive therapy. A Cochrane database review analysed 7 studies of infliximab therapy in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis who wererefractory to therapy with steroids or immunosuppression [406].Three infusions (weeks 0, 2 and 6) were more effective than pla-cebo in inducing clinical remission at week 8 (RR 3.22, 95 % CI2.18 -4.76). Again, no subgroup analysis was performed for patients refractory to immunosuppressive therapy. In the ULTRA-1 study, adalimumab was reported to be superior to placebo in the induction of remission in patients with ulcerative colitis. One hundred and fifty-nine of 390 patients (39 %) werereceiving immunosuppressive therapy at baseline [407, 408]. Atweek 8, in the subgroup of patients with concomitant immuno-suppression, adalimumab induced remission in 15.1 % (8/53),compared with 0 % (0/15) under placebo. In patients receiving im-munosuppression and steroid therapies at baseline, the rate of re-mission at week 8 was 12.2 % (6/49) under adalimumab and 9.5 % (2/34) under placebo. In the ULTRA-2 study, 173 of 494 patients were under immunosuppressive therapy [351]. Adalimumab160 mg/80 every other week induced clinical remissionin 8/53 (15.1 %) patients at week 8, compared with 2/52 (3.8 %)under placebo. A prospective cohort study analysed 53 patients with moder- ate ulcerative colitis under inf liximab or adalimumab therapy. The clinical response rate was 88.7 %, with no significant differ- ence between the therapy groups [409]. All the enrolled patients were intolerant or refractory to an immunosuppressive therapy.However, only 5/25 patients under adalimumab 15/28 under infliximab were receiving treatment with immunosuppressants atbaseline. In the PURSUIT study with golimumab, 31.2 % of patients with moderate to severe disease activity were treated with thiopurines. The concomitant immunosuppression had no influence on the outcome. In patients who are refractory to immunosuppressive therapy, the question frequently arises as to whether immunosuppressionshould be continued during initiation of anti-TNF therapy. In theUC-SUCCESS trial, only patients with steroid refractory diseasewere enrolled. The patients either had to be na\u00efve to immunosup-pressants (90 %) or to have discontinued immunosuppressive therapy at least 3 months before baseline. Due to the high propor- tion of immunosuppressant-na\u00ef ve patients, the data probably cannot be directly extrapolated to immunosuppressant-refractorypatients. The recommendation for adjuvant immunosuppressionin patients treated with inflixima bi st h e r e f o r eb a s e do ni n d i r e c t data indicating that concomitant immunosuppression can inhibitthe production of autoantibodies and/or increase the effective-ness of therapy by raising trough levels [403, 410]. Neither subgroup analyses from clinical trials nor retrospective analyses of pharmacological samples have produced similar results for ada-limumab or golimumab [353, 411]. To date, there is no evidencethat co-immunosuppression with adalimumab or golimumabenhances clinical efficacy. In the GEMINI-1 study, 17.8 % of patients were enrolled while under immunosuppression and 16.6 % under immunosuppressionand steroids [404]. The subgroup analysis of response to induc- tion therapy did not include all patients who had failed immuno- suppressive therapy, but only those who had not also previouslyfailed anti-TNF therapy. In this group, although a trend wasobserved towards an effect of vedolizumab in comparison toplacebo, it did not reach significance (49 % vs. 34.5 %, p = 0.08).The same subgroup analysis in the maintenance phase, one yearafter re-randomisation of patients who responded to inductiontherapy, showed a significantly higher rate of remission under vedolizumab than under placebo (44.6 % under vedolizumab every 8 weeks, 50 % under vedolizumab every 4 weeks and 18 %under placebo). Concomitant immunosuppressive therapy didnot significantly affect these results. The decision to treat withvedolizumab in this situation should be made according to UCdisease activity, since a therapeutic response is not to be expectedduring the first few weeks of therapy. Few data are available concerning the effectiveness of a second anti-TNF substance after failure of an anti-TNF therapy. Fourty- eight per cent of patients enrolled in the GEMINI-1 study of vedo-lizumab had previously failed anti-TNF therapy. Subanalysesrevealed no significant differences between results from thissubgroup and data from the total study population, suggestingthat for vedolizumab, outcomes in patients with prior anti-TNFtherapy failure are similar to those of anti-TNF-na\u00efve patients. In the OCTAVE-1 and OCTAVE-2 trials, which investigated the ef- ficacy of tofacitinib in ulcerative colitis, patients with prior aza- thioprine therapy failure were inc luded. Thus, tofacitinib could represent an option in patients with moderate to severe ulcerativecolitis who are refractory to therapy with thiopurines. Since, at the 191 Kucharzik T et al. Updated S3-Guideline Ulcerative ...Z Gastroenterol 2019; 57: 162 -241 This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. time of going to press with the German version of the guideline, tofacitinib had not yet gained approval for ulcerative colitis therapyin Germany, this substance has not been included in the recom-mendations of these guidelines. Recommendations on the use oftofacitinib will follow in a forthcoming update of this guideline. The use of tacrolimus in patients with ulcerative colitis is sup- ported by several case series [248, 412]. However, there are nocontrolled clinical trials of this substance in patients with UC whohave failed immunosuppressive therapy. The benefits and risks of an immunosuppressive combination therapy, especially vis-\u00e0-vis the option of surgical therapy, shouldbe critically discussed with the patient. Ulcerative colitis with primary or secondary therapy failure under therapy with TNF antibodies RECOMMENDATION 3.32 Patients with primary lack of response to therapy with TNF antibodies should be treated with vedolizumab (Evidencegrade 2, recommendation grade B) or calcineurin inhibitors(Evidence grade 3, recommendation grade B). Patients with moderate ulcerative colitis with secondary lack of response to therapy with TNF antibodies should be treated with alterna-tive TNF antibodies (Evidence grade 4, recommendationgrade B) or vedolizumab (Evidence grade 2, Recommendationgrade B) or calcineurin inhibitors (Evidence grade 3, Recom-mendation grade B). Proctocolectomy should be considered.(Expert consensus, recommendation).Strong consensus Background When considering treatment op tions availabl ef o rp a t i e n t s who fail to respond to TNF antibod y therapy, the differentiation between primary non-response and secondary treatment failureis clinically important. In prin ciple, even in the case of primary treatment failure of a TNF antibody, the possibility of therapyintensification by dose increase should be considered. Especially in patients with endoscopically severe inflammation, the adminis- tered antibodies can be lost via the bowel ( \"faecal loss \"), making a dose increase necessary [385]. In the case of primary lack ofresponse to therapy, the choice of a substitute therapy dependsto a large degree on the urgency of need for remission. Therefore,in patients with severe disease activity, calcineurin inhibitors arethe therapy of choice, being most likely to induce rapid remission.Patients with mild inflammatory activity and less urgency for fast clinical improvement may alternatively be treated with vedolizu- mab. Switching from one TNF antibody to another TNF antibodyis likely to be successful in only approximately 30 % of patientswith primary lack of response [413], and therefore cannot berecommended. In patients with secondary treatment failure, the situation is dif- ferent. In the ULTRA-2 study, the co-primary endpoint of clinical re-mission at week 16 in the subgroup of patients with prior anti-TNF treatment failure was not reached. The other clinical co-primary endpoint, clinical remission at week 52, was reached (10.2 % underadalimumab vs. 3.0 % under placebo, p = 0.039). The difference in this and other endpoints was smaller than in anti-TNF-na\u00efvepatients. The secondary endpoin t of steroid-free remission at week 52 in patients receiving steroids at baseline was not reachedin the subgroup of patients with prior anti-TNF failure. In a meta-analysis, 8 studies focussing on the response to sec- ond-line TNF antibody therapy after secondary failure of a primaryTNF antibody therapy were evaluated. All of the studies involved aswitch from infliximab to adalimumab, with response rates varyingbetween 23 % and 92 % and rates of remission varying between 0 %and 50 % [413]. Although the studies are very heterogeneous anddo not allow a pooled data analysis, the current evidence base jus-tifies a tentative switch from one antibody to another. In the GEMINI-1 study, in which 48 % of the patients had pre- viously failed anti-TNF, the remission rate under vedolizumab wasnot influenced by prior therapy with TNF antibodies [404]. In aGerman cohort study of patients receiving vedolizumab, 25 % ofpatients with ulcerative colitis or Crohn 'sd i s e a s ew e r ei nc l i n i c a l remission at week 14 [414]. As yet, no data have been publishedconcerning the effectiveness of TNF antibodies after primary ther-apy failure with vedolizumab. Two phase 3 studies investigated the efficacy of the JAK inhib- itor tofacitinib (10 mg twice daily) as induction therapy in a totalof 1139 patients with moderate to severe UC [415]. Patients enrolled in the studies had pri or therapy failure with > 1 of steroids, thiopurines or anti-TNF therapy (53 -58 % of patients had previously received TNF ant ibody therapy). Remission at week 8 was reached by 18.5 % and 16.6 % under tofacitinib and8.2 % and 3.6 % under placebo. Both differences were statistically significant. Under tofacitinib, increases in cholesterol and creati- nine levels were observed, and in the 10 mg group, an increasedfrequency of infections, especially herpes infections. At the timeof going to press, tofacitinib did not yet gain approval in Germanyfor the treatment of patients with ulcerative colitis, and in view ofthe lack of clinical evidence, its placement within the therapyalgorithm for ulcerative colitis cannot be conclusively evaluated. Ozanimod, a modulator of the sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor subtypes 1 and 5, has been investigated in a randomised phase 2 trial, in which 16 % of the patients reached clinical remis-sion at week 8, compared with 6 % under placebo (p = 0.048)[416]. Further studies are required to further assess the efficacyand safety of ozanimod. Since patients who have experienced primary or secondary fail- ure to TNF antibody therapy are generally very ill and frequently\"beyond treatment \"(i. e. drug therapy options have been exhaus- ted), the option of proctocolectomy should always be considered and discussed with the patient. The use of biosimilars in patients with ulcerative colitis At the time of guideline preparation (in German language), only the infliximab biosimilar had been approved for the treatment ofpatients with ulcerative colitis. However, additional biosimilarswill follow in the coming years. A general recommendation forthe use of biosimilars will not be included in this guideline, since biosimilars are simply a different variation of a monoclonal anti- 192 Kucharzik T et Gastroenterol 2019; 57: 162 -241Leitlinie This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. body (at the present time, infliximab), the use of which has already been discussed. However, since the use of biosimilars iscurrently the subject of considerable, and sometimes heated, de-bate, a few general comments concerning the use of biosimilarsare included below. The molecular structure of the currently available infliximab bio- similars is very similar to that of the reference product. All of thesubstances have shown similar physical and chemical characteris-tics, biological activity, pharmacokinetics and toxicity in animalstudies and in healthy human subjects. Two phase 3 studies dem-onstrated a comparable efficacy, toxicity, and immunogenicity forbiosimilar and reference produ ct ankylosing Several open-label studies indicate that the infliximab biosimilar is effective in patients with ulcerative colitis. On the basis of preclinical and clinical data,the use of infliximab biosimilars in rheumatoid arthritis, spondy-loarthritis, ulcerative colitis and Crohn 's disease has been approved by the EMA. It is to be expected that biosimilar substances will beincreasingly introduced in the coming years, significantly expand-ing the spectrum of use of biosimilars in ulcerative colitis. The avail-ability of biosimilars promotes competition and will contribute to cost reduction in financially overburdened health services. In addi- tion, these important medications will be made available to a widerpatient population. Thus, biosimilars seem to represent a real alter-native to the original products. In spite of the lack of randomisedstudies in patients with UC, existing study data and clinical experi-ence suggest that the efficacy of biosimilars is comparable to thatof the original product, without any significant difference in thespectrum of side-effects. Negative data which would argue against the use of biosimilars in inflammatory bowel disease have not yet been published from studies, nor are they known from clinical prac-tice. Biosimilars have been in use in a number of other indicationsfor over 10 years, underlining that the introduction of new biosimi-lars can be considered safe, provided they have undergone testingin clinical studies. Currently available data on patie nts switching from the origi- nator to an infliximab biosimilar (e. g. from the NorSwitch trial [419]) do not reveal any relevant evidence of efficacy loss, an increased rate of side effects or problems concerning immuno-genicity. However, since the evidence base is considerably lessrobust compared to the originators, further study data should becollected to dispel any possible concerns in this respect. Gastroen-terologists should familiarise themselves with the biosimilar con-cept in the therapy of inflammatory bowel disease and addressunfounded concerns relating to the safety and efficacy of these substances. Regardless of the relative safety of infliximab biosimi- lar use to date as a primary therapy and presumably also in thecase of a switch, the production process of biosimilars must besubject to the highest quality control requirements. Furthermore,the greatest possible transparency must be demanded withregard to the manufacturing process and the prescription of bio-logic substances. In principle, the use of biologics or biosimilarsshould be bound by a requirement that the attending physician can clearly distinguish the prod ucts he or she prescribes, and that he or she retains the decision-making authority, at least withregard to switching therapy between the original product and abiosimilar during ongoing therapy. Repeated switching frombiosimilar to originator, or between different biosimilars ( \"multi- switch \") cannot be recommended, since no data are available. Maintenance therapy of remission in patients with complicated disease progression in ulcerative colitis RECOMMENDATION 3.33 After achieving remission, maintenance therapy with thiopur- ines should be used in patients with mild to moderate diseaseactivity if early or frequent relapses occur under optimally-dosed regimens with mesalazine or if the is intolerantto mesalazines (Evidence grad e1 ) ,o ri ft h e r ei ss t e r o i d - dependent disease progression (Evidence grade 2) or if the patient has responded to induction therapy with ciclosporin or tacrolimus (Evidence grade 3).Recommendation grade B, strong consensus Background Several randomised, controlled studies have investigated the effectiveness of thiopurines (aza thioprine and mercaptopurine) for maintenance of remission in patients with ulcerative colitis [401, 420 -425]. A Cochrane meta-analysis of 7 of these studies, including a total of 302 patients, concludes that the overall effec-tiveness of thiopurines is moderate and that evidence supportingthe use of thiopurines in ulcerative colitis is significantly weakerthan in Crohn 's disease [ 233]. The quality of older trials is gener- ally not comparable to the results of contemporary studies. It isalso unclear on the basis of these studies whether concomitantmedication with mesalazine enables therapy optimisation. Nota- ble is the high rate of azathioprine-induced side effects, especially the onset of acute pancreatitis, hepatopathy and bone marrowsuppression. Additional evidence for the use of thiopurines inulcerative colitis can be found in retrospective studies [426 - 431]. A study from Oxford with 346 patients showed a remissionrate of 58 % under azathioprine, increasing to 87 % in patientstreated with azathioprine for more than 6 months. Assuming astrict definition of disease relapse, the remission rate after 5 years was 62 %, and 81 % if mild flares could be treated with short-term steroid therapy. The median time to relapse after discontinuationof azathioprine treatment was 18 months [427]. In a more recentretrospective study, approximately one-third of patients relapsedwithin 3 years of stopping thiopurine therapy, whereby patientswith extensive ulcerative colitis, in particular, showed biologicalsigns of increased inflammatory activity at treatment discontinua-tion, or only endured thiopurine therapy for a short period of time [432]. Calcineurin inhibitors (ciclosporin A, tacrolimus) are used as rescue therapies in patients with steroid-refractory ulcerative coli-tis. Because of their side-effect profile, they should, if possible, bediscontinued within 6 months. Therefore, calcineurin inhibitorsplay an important role as bridging therapy until IBD therapieswith delayed-onset efficacy can take effect. In this case, thiopur-ine treatment should be given as an overlap therapy as soon as the patient shows a clear response to calcineurin inhibitors. At the same time, steroids should be tapered. By combining thiopur- 193 Kucharzik T et al. Updated S3-Guideline Ulcerative ...Z Gastroenterol 2019; 57: 162 -241 This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. ines with calcineurin inhibitors, the high rate of with calcineurin inhibitor monotherapy, which lies between36 % and 69 % at 12 months, can be significantly reduced [369,370, 398, 399]. Retrospective case series have shown that byusing thiopurines, the risk of colectomy after therapy with calci- neurin inhibitors can be reduced [369, 370, 433]. In view of the delayed-onset effect of thiopurines, calcineurin inhibitors shouldbe discontinued 3 -6 months after beginning overlap therapy. The optimal dose of azathioprine in patients with ulcerative colitishas not yet been identified in studies. Therefore, in analogy toCrohn 's disease, the usual dosage for azathioprine in ulcerative c o l i t i si s1 . 5 -2.5 mg/kg BW/day or half of for 6-mercap- topurine [242]. Due to the pharmacodynamics of the substance (onset of therapeutic effect only after 6 -12 weeks), longer-term therapy planning is required. RECOMMENDATION 3.34 In patients who respond to induction therapy with TNF antibo- dies, maintenance therapy with TNF antibodies with or with- out thiopurines is recommended. Evidence grade 1, recommendation grade A, strong consensus In patients who respond to induction therapy with vedolizu-mab, maintenance therapy with vedolizumab is recommended. Evidence grade 1, recommendation grade A, strong consensus Background Maintenance of remission with TNF antibodies In the ACT studies, it was demonstrated that patients receiving infliximab therapy were significantly more likely to remain inremission at weeks 30 and 54 (ACT-1 only) than patients underplacebo (see Table 8 ). Notably, however, the proportion of patients with steroid-free remission, although statistically signifi-cant, was small. In ACT-1, rates of steroid-free remission at week 54 were 24 % (infliximab 5 mg/kg), 19 % (infliximab 10 mg/kg) and10 % (placebo). In ACT-2 the rates at week 30 were 18 % (inflixi-mab 5 mg/kg), 27 % (infliximab 10 mg/kg) and 3 % (placebo)[350]. One study reported the long-term outcomes of 121 patients with refractory ulcerative colitis who were treated with infliximab[434]. Of the 67 % of patients who responded to infliximab ther-apy, 68 % showed a lasting response (median observation period33.0 months; 17.0 -49.8 months). A total of 17 % underwent colectomy. Adalimumab was also shown to be superior to placebo for maintenance therapy. Remission rates in the ULTRA-2 study at week 8 were 16.5 % (adalimumab) and 9.3 % (placebo, p = 0.019) and at week 52, 17.3 % (adalimumab) vs. 8.5 % (placebo,p = 0.004) [351]. Since infliximab was already approved at thetime of the ULTRA-2 study, a relevant proportion (40 %) ofpatients had previously been treated with infliximab. For thesepatients, in terms of remission at week 8, there was no differenceto placebo; at week 52, only 10.2 % of these patients were inremission (placebo 3 %, p = 0.039). In 2015, a review of published case series reported remission rates of 0 -50 % in patients previously treated with infliximab [413, 435]. In addition, long-term adalimumab therapy over a duration of 52 weeks led to areduced hospitalisation rate [435]. Data on the use of adalimu-mab beyond week 52 are provided by the pooled analysis ofULTRA 1, ULTRA-2 and ULTRA-3 [436]. For 199 patients, four years of therapy data are available; the remission rate at week208 was 24.7 %, and approximately 60 % of patients who were in remission after one year remained in remission at week 156. In the PURSUIT-M trial, the efficacy of subcutaneous (s. c.) golimumab was demonstrated in pat ients with ulcerative colitis who had received no prior anti-TNF therapy [353]. In patientswho responded to golimumab at week 6, this response was sus-Table 8 Overview of remission rates under TNF-antibody therapies.

Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. tained at week 54 in 47 % (50 mg golimumab s. c. every 4 weeks) and 49.7 % (100 mg golimumab s. c. every 4 weeks) of thesepatients, compared to 31.2 % on placebo. In patients receiving100 mg golimumab s. c. every 4 weeks, clinical remission in27.8 % and mucosal healing in 42.4 % at week 54 were reported (placebo 15.6 % and 26.6 %, respectively). Maintenance of remission with vedolizumabData concerning the effectiveness of long-term vedolizumab therapy is provided by the GEMINI-I study [404] .At week 52, a remission rate of 41.8 % was reported for 8-weekly treatmentwith 300 mg vedolizumab, and 44.8 % for 4-weekly treatment(placebo 15.9 %). However, the difference between response to4- and 8-weekly dosing was not significant [437]. In a subgroup analysis of the GEMINI-1 trial data, vedolizumab was found to be e f f e c t i v ei nb o t ha n t i - T N F - n a \u00ef v ea n da n t i - T N F - e x p o s e dp a t i e n t s ,albeit with lower remission rates among the patients with prioranti-TNF therapy failure (46.9 % versus 36.1 % in week 52) [438].In a recently published follow-up study, even three years after suc-cessful induction therapy, 50 % of patients who had initiallyresponded to vedolizumab therapy were reported to have muco-sal healing [439]. Real-world data from a German cohort docu- ment steroid-free clinical remission after 54 weeks in 22 % of patients initially treated with vedolizumab [440]. In 56 % of thesepatients, vedolizumab was discontinued after a median of18 weeks. In a French cohort, 40.5 % of patients were in steroid-free clinical remission under ve dolizumab after one year. The majority of patients who were in remission at week 22 maintainedthis remission until week 54 [441]. A meta-analysis confirmed theusefulness of vedolizumab in maintenance therapy, demonstrat- ing its effect in terms of relapse prevention [442]. Combination therapies in maintenance therapyIn the UC-SUCCESS trial, the efficacy of azathioprine (2.5 mg/ kg daily dose) and infliximab (5 mg/kg at weeks 0, 2, 6, 14) ascombination therapy was examined with regard to remission atweek 16 [403]. The combination therapy, with a steroid-freeremission rate of 39.7 % in week 16, was found to be superior toeither of the substances as monotherapy (infliximab monother- apy 22.1 azathioprine monotherapy 23.7 %). Mucosal healing occurred in 62.8 % of patients receiving combination therapy,compared to 54.6 % under IFX monotherapy and 36.8 % underazathioprine monotherapy. It should be noted, however, that theremission rate was examined only at the week 16 timepoint andnot over a longer period. Furthermore, only patients na\u00efve to ther-apy with thiopurines and TNF antibodies were enrolled. Robust data on the use of a combination therapy consisting of azathioprine together with adalimumab or golimumab in the ther- apy of patients with ulcerative colitis are not available. In a retro-spective analysis of 23 patients treated with immunomodulators(thiopurines n = 14; MTX n = 9) after losing response to adalimumabtherapy, 11 of these patients (48 %) showed a reduction in adalimu-mab antibodies, a recovery of adalimumab trough levels, and aclinical response [443]. However, since only two of the 23 patientshad ulcerative colitis, the results do not allow for a general recom- mendation on combination therapy with adalimumab in ulcerative colitis. Prospective data in patients with Crohn 's disease indicate that outcomes are no better than under adalimumab monotherapy,although the combination therapy showed advantages with respect to the secondary endpoint of mucosal healing [444]. Studies offering head-to-head comparisons of the individual substances regarding their efficacy in remission maintenance arelacking. Therefore, it is not possible to give a recommendation as to which substance should be preferred. Usually, however, the substance used to induce remission is also administered for main-tenance therapy. RECOMMENDATION 3.35 Methotrexate, ciclosporin an d tacrolimus should be used for maintenance therapy only in exceptional cases.Evidence grade 4, recommendation grade B, strong consensus Background To date, there is insufficient evidence in support of the use of methotrexate or tacrolimus for remission maintenance. A rando-mised, placebo-controlled trial of methotrexate in 67 patients showed that oral treatment with 12.5 mg methotrexate per week failed to maintain remission over a duration of 9 months[445]. Various retrospective studies have examined the efficacyof methotrexate for maintenance therapy in patients with ulcera-tive colitis. Most patients had previously failed therapy with, orshown intolerance to, azathioprine. The response/remission ratesreported in these studies were between 30 % and 80 % [424, 446].Overall, the data on maintenance therapy in patients with ulcera- tive colitis are very heterogeneous. A systematic Cochrane meta- analysis concluded that methotrexate cannot currently be recom-mended for maintenance therapy [447]. RECOMMENDATION 3.36 Due to the lack of evidence, no recommendation can be made on the duration of maintenance therapy with thiopurines, TNF antibodies and vedolizumab. However, long-term continua-tion of maintenance therapy will frequently be necessary.Expert consensus, strong consensus Background For all the above-named substances, the existing data are insufficient to assess either the optimal duration of therapy or the optimal premises for therapy discontinuation. The effectiveness of azathioprine was investigated in a retro- spective study in 346 patients with ulcerative colitis. The remis-sion rates after one, two and five years were 95 %, 69 % and 55 %,respectively [427]. However, the retrospective character of thestudy must be considered a limitation. Moreover, remission andrelapse of ulcerative colitis were defined only by the absence oruse of steroid medication. Likewise, the optimal therapy duration for biologics (TNF antibodies, vedolizumab) is unknown. In the respective pivotalstudies, during which patients received maintenance therapy forapproximately one year, superiority in maintenance therapy com- 195 Kucharzik T et al. Updated S3-Guideline Ulcerative ...Z Gastroenterol 2019; 57: 162 -241 This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. pared to placebo was documented for infliximab [350, 351, 353] and vedolizumab [404]. Anti-TNF therapy should therefore becontinued for at least one year. The extent to which patients whoare in remission after one year benefit from continuation of ther-apy, and whether remission should be defined purely clinically or endoscopically, has yet to be determined. A considerable proportion of patients will experience a relapse within 12 months of discontinuing anti-TNF therapy. In a meta-anal-ysis from 2016, a relapse rate of 28 % was found in patients treatedwith infliximab or adalimumab 12 months after therapy discontinua-tion; 80 % responded to the same therapy upon reintroduction [80].A further meta-analysis including patients with both Crohn 's disease and ulcerative colitis determined a relapse rate of approximately 50 %, two years after discontinuation of anti-TNF therapy [448]. RECOMMENDATION 3.37 The apathogenic Escherichia coli strain Nissle 1917 can be used in justified cases as an alternative to mesalazine. Evidence grade 2, recommendation grade 0, strong consensus Background A 2015 meta-analysis evaluated a total of six studies investigat- ing the use of E. coli Nissle (EcN) 1917 in ulcerative colitis. It con- cluded that EcN was as effective for maintenance therapy asmesalazine [268]. It should be noted, however, that in some ofthe included studies, EcN was tested only against placebo, and it showed no significant advantage over placebo during induction therapy. Furthermore, all studies taking mesalazine as comparatortook a daily dose of 500 -800 mg, a dosage well below that regarded as effective (see recommendation 3.13). A large propor-tion of consensus participants considered the studies to be insuf-ficiently valid. RECOMMENDATION 3.38 Therapeutic drug monitoring can be carried out during ther- apy with thiopurines, TNF antibodies and vedolizumab, ifrequired to support clinical decision-making.Expert consensus, recommendation open, strong consensusUnder therapy with calcineuri n inhibitors, trough levels should be monitored regularly. Expert consensus, strong recommendation, strong consensus Background Despite the increasing number of drug therapies available for ulcerative colitis and the possibility of combination therapieswith certain drugs, the number of effective therapies remains lim-ited. Moreover, since the response and remission rates undersecond and third-line TNF antibody therapies are very poor, the available therapies should be administered at an optimal dose and at optimal dose intervals. Drug monitoring of TNF antibodiesThe of infliximab, adalimumab and golimu- correlate with their clinical effectiveness, and high trough lev-els are more often found in patients with clinical and endoscopicremission in the form of mucosal healing [352, 449 -453]. In a recent meta-analysis of 22 studies including a total of 3483 patients with Crohn 's disease or ulcerative colitis, infliximab trough levels > 2 \u00b5g/ml correlated with a good clinical response and lower CRPlevels [454]. For adalimumab, trough levels of > 6 g/L, and for goli- mumab, trough levels of > 2.5 g/mL at week 6 and > 1.4 g/mL in maintenance therapy, have been reported to be associated with ahigh likelihood of clinical remission [456] .In patients who developed detectable antibodies directed against biologics and, at the sametime, had low trough levels, treatment continuation was successful in only 17 % of IBD patients, whereas switching to a different TNF antibody achieved a response in approximately 92 % [457]. Thesefigures, however, originate from a retrospective data analysis [457] . Furthermore, it must be taken into account that a considerable pro-portion of patients who switch to adalimumab after failure of inflix-imab therapy will develop anti-adalimumab antibodies, which leadto a loss of response [458] .If, despite low trough levels and detect- able antibodies to an anti-TNF agent, the dose is increased or the ap- plication interval shortened, an increased rate of allergic reactions is to be expected; a meta-analysis from 2014 showed patients withanti-infliximab antibodies to have a 2.4-fold increased risk of allergicinfusion reaction and a 5.8-fold risk of severe allergic reaction [459].If, however, autoantibodies to TNF antibodies are detected, but atthe same time, trough levels are high, it should be noted that suchantibodies are frequently transient [460] and disappear in two out ofthree patients during the course of treatment [461]. A recent study of 247 patients with IBD showed that therapeutic drug monitoring, i. e. measurement of trough levels and corresponding autoantibo-dies, resulted in therapeutic consequences in over 70 % of patients[462]. Nevertheless, therapeutic drug monitoring cannot answer allclinical questions and, due to its numerous limitations, can currentlybe recommended only as one of many possible tools for therapymanagement in patients with ulcerative colitis. Drug monitoring of vedolizumab In the pivotal study GEMINI-I, it was reported that a higher trough level at week 6 was associated with higher response and remissionrates [404]. Although clinical experience of trough level determina-tion for vedolizumab is still very limited, there are indications thatdrug monitoring can play a useful role in optimising vedolizumabtherapy. A clear recommendation in favour of vedolizumab drugmonitoring cannot be given at the present time [463 -465]. Drug monitoring of calcineurin inhibitors The effective trough levels of calcineurin inhibitors are subject to considerable interindividua l variation. Therapy management therefore necessitates regular trough level determination anddose adjustment. The effectiveness of ciclosporin and tacrolimusin patients with ulcerative colitis has already been addressed indetail (see backgr ound to recommendations 3.26 -3.28). In sum- mary, an initial dose of 2 mg/kg BW ciclosporin A is currentlyrecommended, with subsequent d ose adjustment according to trough levels. While the optimal level remains unclear, the target trough level should be 250 -4 0 0 n g / m L .T a c r o l i m u si si n i t i a l l y administered at a dose of 0.05 mg/kg BW orally twice daily andthe dose thereafter modified according to trough levels.

Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. again, the optimal trough levels are not yet known. Trough levels of 4 -8 ng/mL [466], 5 -10 ng/mL [375] or 10 -15 ng/mL [374] have been recommended. Evidence-based recommendationsconcerning the frequency of trough level determination are notavailable. In the initial treatm ent phase, more frequent trough level measurement will be required, e. g., weekly. If trough levels and dosage are stable, the frequency of trough level determina-tion can be reduced. The correlation between trough levels andside-effect rates is often a limiting factor and not all patients willtolerate a high trough level (10 -15 ng/mL) in the long term. 4. Infectious problems The understanding of the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis has been significantly broadened over the last few decades. Clinicaland experimental findings suggest that a gastrointestinal barriermalfunction and the dysregulation of the immune system play acausal role. There is, however, no evidence that patients withulcerative colitis themselves develop an immune defect increasingtheir susceptibility to bacterial or viral infections. Rather, the ther-apy with immunosuppressive drugs c auses partial deficits in the innate and acquired immune system, which can often lead to typical and opportunistic infec tions. In patients with a severe course of disease, the resulting malnutrition can intensify drug-in-duced immune deficiency. STATEMENT 4.1 If several immunosuppressive drugs are given in combination, the risk of infections increases markedly with the addition ofeach additional drug. Elderly patients, patients with comorbid-ities, patients with a history of severe infectious disease andmalnourished patients are particularly at risk from infections. Evidence grade 3, strong consensus Background Each immunomodulatory drug bears an incr eased risk of infec- tion for patients with ulcerative colitis. The risk is, however, notindividually quantifi able [306]. A case control study analysing a total of 300 patients with IBD showed that the risk of opportunis-tic infection under monotherapy with steroids, azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine or infliximab was three times higher comparedto patients not receiving immunosuppressive therapy. However,c o m b i n a t i o nt h e r a p yw i t ht w oo rt h r e eo ft h ea b o v ed r u g sw a s associated with a drastic increase in the risk of infection (OR 14.5) [11]. Anti-integrin antibody therapy probably does notcause an increased risk of infection [ 467]. In estimating the risk of therapy-induced infections, it is often overlooked that systemic steroids carry a considerable risk ofinfection [468]. Rheumatological data show that the risk of infec-tion is increased in patients taking a dose of more than 10 mgprednisone or a cumulative dose of more than 700 mg, and in those with a therapy duration longer than two weeks [469, 470]. An analysis of about 500 patients with new-onset tuberculosis in-dicates that the risk of becoming infected with tuberculosis is increased 5-fold in patients under systemic steroid therapy com-pared to patients not receiving steroids. Moreover, the riskincrease was dose-dependent, patients with a maximum dailysteroid dose of less than 15 mg/day having an approximately 3-fold increase, whereas in those receiving more than 15 mg/day, the risk was increased almost 8-fold [471]. IBD patients over 50 years of age are reported to have a three times greater risk of infection than patients under 25 years [11,472, 473]. Possible r easons for the heightened risk of infection in older individuals are changes in both the innate and adaptive im-mune systems [474]. Data from patients with rheumatoid arthritisshow that comorbidities (e. g. kidney malfunction, diabetes melli- tus) and prior severe infectious disease in the medical history represent additional risk factors for the occurrence of infections[475]. Diabetes has been described as a manifest risk factor forinfection in patients with IBD [476]. Particularly in elderlypatients, therefore, the risk of drug-induced infections must becarefully weighed up against the possibly lower surgery-associat-ed risks of proctocolectomy. RECOMMENDATION 4.2 At the time of first diagnosis or, at the latest, before starting immunosuppressive therapy, all patients should be screenedfor hepatitis B, tuberculosis an d EBV infection. Tuberculosis screening is to be repeated prior to the introduction of biologic therapy. Evidence grade 3, recommendation grade B, consensus RECOMMENDATION 4.3 Before initiating immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory therapy for ulcerative colitis, a targeted past medical history, an X-ray examination of the lungs and an interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) should be performed to rule out activeor latent tuberculosis infection.Evidence grade 3, recommendation grade B, strong consensus Background Immunosuppressive therapy, including therapy with TNF anti- bodies, or chemotherapy can significantly increase the risk of hepatitis B (JBV) reactivation in HBV carriers. In HBsAg carriers, the incidence of HBV reactivation during or after chemotherapyis 15 HBV reactivation erably less frequently in HBsAg-negative patients, its reactivationhas been described in 14 -20 % of anti-HBc- and anti-HBs-positive patients with lymphoma under chemotherapy [479]. A Spanishstudy reported chronic HBV infection in 3 of 80 patients withCrohn 's disease. Two of the patients developed severe hepatitis after discontinuation of infliximab therapy, while the third died due to complications related to liver cirrhosis [480]. These exam-ples show that the problem of reactivation not only has implica-tions for long-term consequences (e. g. cirrhosis or hepatocellular 197 Kucharzik T et ...Z Gastroenterol 2019; 57: 162 -241 This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. carcinoma) but that the risk of acute exacerbation of hepatitis B with a fulminant course is also increased [481]. Ther efore, screen- ing for HBsAg and anti-HBc antibodies in allpatients prior to commencement of immunosuppressive therapy.In seronegative patients, vaccination is recommended. nucleoside/nuc leotide analogues counteracts HBV reactivation HBsAg-positivepatients. In HbsAg-negative and anti-HBc-antibody-positive patients, close monitoring of ALT and HBV DNA is recommended.For details on preventive drug therapies and the management ofHbsAg-negative and anti-HBc-antibody-positive patients, currentguidelines should be consulted [482]. Before initiating immunosuppressive therapy -which includes, strictly speaking, high-dose steroid therapy -the patient should be screened for tuberculosis. If possible, screening should be per-formed as soon as ulcerative colitis is diagnosed. In principle,either the Tuberculin Skin Test (TST) or Interferon-GammaRelease Assay (IGRA) can be used for immunodiagnostic testing,possibly in combination with a chest X-ray examination. All of theavailable testing methods have weaknesses. Although the risk offalse-negative results using IGRA is low, this cannot be excluded, especially in patients with severe lymphopoenia and immunosup- pression [483]. vaccinated patients have false-positive results [484]. Alongside the IGRA, X-ray examina-tions of the lungs may reveal signs of past, untreated tuberculosiswith no evidence of activity (calcified nodules, peak fibrosis,pleural weals), which are considered an indication for chemopre-vention (see recommendation 4.19). The risk of tuberculosis is probably greater under therapy with TNF antibodies compared to other immunomodulatory/-suppres-sive drugs. Accordingly, it is recommended that tuberculosis diag-nostics be repeated prior to the initiation of TNF antibody therapy,to rule out the possibility that tuberculosis infection may haveoccurred since initial IBD diagnosis and tuberculosis screening. Anumber of professional societies recommend annual tuberculosisscreening in patients under continual anti-TNF therapy, given the conversion rate of tuberculosis-screening-negative to tuberculo- sis-screening-positive patients of up to 30 % [485]. Due to thelow prevalence of tuberculosis in Germany, this recommendationcannot be followed. However, individuals with an increased risk ofexposure (e. g. airport personne l, employees of pulmonological clinics, long-distance travellers to tuberculosis-endemic regions, etc.) should undergo screening on an annual basis. Even though epidemiological evidence of an increased risk of tuberculosis under therapy with anti-integrin or JAK-inhibitor ther- apy is lacking (in all of the pivotal trials, patients with latent tubercu-losis were excluded), tuberculosis should be ruled out prior to ther-apy initiation, not least on account of the drug approval stipulations. Infection with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) usually occurs during childhood and often takes an asymptomatic course. In adolescentsand adults, the primary infection manifests as infectious mononu-cleosis in 30 -60 % of cases. At the age of forty, approximately 95 % of the population are infected with EBV. Following a symptomatic or asymptomatic infection, EBV persists lifelong in B-cells in the circu-lation under the control of EBV-specific cytotoxic cells [486]. If theimmunosurveillance of the T-cells is disrupted, e. g. in a post-trans-plantation setting, the proliferation of EBV-infected B-cells is en- hanced, resulting in an increased risk post-transplan-tation B-cell lymphoma or lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) [487].Primary EBV infection in the first few years after transplantation isassociated with a considerably increased risk of PTLD [488, 489]. RECOMMENDATION 4.4 Upon initial diagnosis, or, at the latest, before immunosup- pressive therapy is initiated, vaccination status should bereviewed and updated as appropriate. Non-live vaccines are considered safe under immunosuppressive therapy, whereas live vaccines are contraindicated. In view of the above, vacci-nations against pneumococcal infection, hepatitis B, influenzaand pandemic flu should be administered analogous to therecommendations of the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) ( \"Vacci- nations under immunosuppression \"). Evidence grade 2, recommendation grade B, strong consensus Background Patients with ulcerative colitis have an increased risk of con- tracting vaccine-preventable infectious disease and also of beinghospitalised as a consequence [490]. Several healthcare researchprojects found that many patients with IBD have only inadequatevaccination coverage. The main caveat against vaccination is anoften unfounded fear of side effects. Some patients are also afraidthat vaccinations may cause exacerbation of the underlying dis- ease; however, in principle, the majority of patients are prepared to undergo vaccination as recommended [491]. In all patients with ulcerative colitis, compliance with the gen- eral vaccination recommendations of the RKI should be reviewedat diagnosis and subsequently at regular (e. g., annual) intervals.At the time of diagnosis, it is frequently still possible to catch upon live vaccinations (especially measles, rubella, varicella) whichhave previously been missed. After of immunosuppres- sive therapy, live vaccinations are formally contraindicated, although probably nevertheless safely practicable [492]. It shouldbe kept in mind that patients under ongoing imm unosuppression, particularly under anti-TNF or combined immunosuppressivetherapy, have reduced response rates to vaccination and thereforerequire appropriate monitoring [493]. Depending on the severityof disease and the therapy, patients should be annually vaccinatedagainst influenza A/B. Inoculation against pneumococcal infection is indicated in all patients who require, or may potentially require, immunosuppressive therapy. The i nitial vaccination should be performed with PCV13 and the booster with PPV23. Vaccinationsagainst meningococci and Haemophilus influenzae may be appro-priate in individual cases, as well as specific travel vaccinations. RECOMMENDATION 4.5 Patients treated with triple immunosuppressive therapy should receive a PJP (Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia) prophylaxis. Evidence grade 4, recommendation grade B, consensus 198 Kucharzik T et al. Updated S3-Guideline Ulcerative ...Z Gastroenterol 2019; 57: 162 -241Leitlinie This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. Background The onset of PJP has been observed during therapy with steroids, thioguanines, i nhibitors or biologics, and combination therapies appearing topose the highest risk [494]. The available retrospective studies indi- cate that the absolute incidence is relatively low: in the Olmsted County cohort, only 3 cases of PJP were observed in 937 patients(6066 patient years 'follow-up), despite irregular prophylactic ther- apy [495]. In an analysis of data from health insurance companies, arisk increase from 3 to 10.6/100 000 person years was found for IBDpatients in comparison to the gen eral population, and a further increase up to 32/100 000 person years in IBD patients underimmunosuppressive therapy [496]. Systematic data describing the risk of PJP under specific immunosuppressive regimes are lacking. Therefore, the recommendation is also based on experience frompatients with other underlying diseases (see also: [330]). TMP/SMX prophylaxis is highly effective for PJP prevention in children and adults with haematological disease, bone marrowtransplantation or organ transplantation [497]. In the 2014 ECCOguidelines \"Opportunistic Infections \",P J Pp r o p h y l a x i si sr e c o m - mended under triple immunosuppression incorporating a calci- neurin inhibitor or TNF antibody, with a calcineurin inhibitor, a prophylaxisshould be considered [330]. While a CD4 cell count < 200/\u00b5Lrepresents an important risk factor for PJP in numerous HIV-inde-pendent diseases [498], there is insufficient evidence to support afirm recommendation for CD4 monitoring in IBD patients. Therecommended prophylactic n, sulphamethoxazole/trime- thoprim (800/160 mg) 3 times w eekly, has been shown to be well tolerated [497, 499]. In cases of sulphonamide allergy, it is advisable to consult a specialist in infectiology. RECOMMENDATION 4.6 In patients with known ulcerative colitis with a severe acute episode, atypical symptoms, a refractory disease course, or prior to the intensification o f immunosuppressive therapy, microbiological diagnostics including examination for Clostri-dium difficile should be carried out.Evidence grade 3, recommendation grade B, strong consensus Background Routine diagnostics for C. difficile are not recommended in pa- tients with mild disease flares, since C. difficile infection (CDI) is uncommon in this situation [42, 500]. However, hospitalisedpatients and patients with prior antibiotic therapy have a higherrate of CDI. IBD patients with CDI have longer hospital stays anda four-fold increased mortality rate in comparison to IBD patientswithout CDI. Screening for C. difficile is therefore recom-mended [52, 337, 501]. Glucocorticoids (OR 2.5), immunomodulators (OR 1.6) and TNF antibodies (OR 2.7) are risk factors for severe CDI [502 - 504]. Empirical data from IBD patients and from the field of trans-plantation medicine show that immunosuppressive therapy is associated with a higher incidence (OR 2.5 for AZA/6-MP or MTX)and increased severity of the infection [52, 505]. Steroid therapy increased the risk of CDI threefold in comparison to AZA/6-MPand MTX in 10 662 patients with IBD (RR 3.4; 95 % CI 1.9 -6.1) [503]. Additional risk factors include (prior) antibiotic therapy ornasogastric tube feeding/PEG [506]. IBD patients with CDI and concomitant proton pump inhibitor therapy have an almost four times higher risk of recurrence of C. difficile colitis [339]. RECOMMENDATION 4.7 Diagnostic procedures to detect infection with Clostridium difficile should be carried out promptly using a sensitive testing method. Evidence grade 3, recommendation grade B, strong consensus Background C. difficile diagnostics should be performed promptly using a sensitive detection method [338]. As a rule, one soft-to-liquidstool sample is sufficient; formed stool diagnostics are not indica- ted. In special situations, e. g., in patients with ileus, a rectal swab can be used. There is no generally accepted algorithm forbiochemical diagnostics, as confirmed by the current guidelinesof the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and InfectiousDiseases (ESCMID) [507]. In prin ciple, test procedures can be differentiated into two distinct types, one-step or multistep.Time-saving diagnostic methods such as direct antigen detectionin [GDH]), the (so-called rapid tests) or biomolecular test methods are suitable for toxin detection [338]. Detection by GDH is unspe-cific and must be confirmed by a second, specific test. In patientswith severe, notifiable infection, patients with recurring infection,and in the context of nosocomial outbreaks, additional culturalverification should be sought. This enables the detection of epide-miologically particularly important strains (e. g., ribotype 027)and antibiotic resistance testing [508]. It is also important to note that a stool test negative for C. difficile toxins is not sufficient to rule out pseudomembranous colitis. In patients with ulcerative colitis and other patients under immunosuppression, smaller quantities of toxins (which are unde-tectable in the diagnostic tests) are apparently sufficient to triggerpseudomembranous colit is. Repeated stool studies for toxin detec- tion or the performance of C. difficile culture followed by toxindetection are therefore recommended [509]. Sigmoidoscopy can also be useful, especially in patie nts with refractory disease and negative stool cultures [508]. However, negative findings do notrule out infection, especially since the typical endoscopic findingswith formation of pseudomembranes are often lacking. RECOMMENDATION 4.8 Depending on its clinical severity, recommendations for specific primary therapy of CDI are as follows: Patients with mild to moderate disease and without riskfactors for a severe disease course can be treated with me-tronidazole 3 \u00d7 400 mg/day p. o. for a minimum of 10 days. 199 Kucharzik T et al. Updated S3-Guideline Ulcerative ...Z Gastroenterol 2019; 57: 162 -241 This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. Patients with severe disease or with predictors of a severe disease course should be treated with vancomycin4 \u00d7 125 -250 mg/day p. o. for a minimum of 10 days. In patients with recurrent disease or additional risk factors for complications (immunosuppression, comorbidity,necessity for additional antibiotic therapy), treatment withfidaxomicin 2 \u00d7 200 mg/day p. o. can be considered. In patients with recurrent or therapy-refractive Clostridium difficile infection, faecal microbiota transplantation can be performed. Expert consensus, recommendation open, strong consensus Background When treating CDI, it is important to maintain contact isola- tion and coat and glove care, and to ensure that hands are cleaned with soap and sporicidal disinfectants [510]. While there are a variety of recommendations concerning options for drug therapyof patients with CDI, almost all include antibiotic therapy with me-tronidazole or vancomycin, varying only in the drug dose, dura-tion of therapy, and type of antibiotic to be given as the primarytherapy. Controlled studies investigating drug therapies of C.difficile in patients with IBD ar e lacking. The recommendations given above are in line with the German S2k guideline, \"Gastroin- testinal Infections and Whipple 's disease \"[338]. Depending on the severity of disease, primary therapy with metronidazole or vancomycin is recommended. If the clinicalcourse permits, any ongoing antibiotic treatments should bediscontinued before beginning CDI therapy. In patients withsymptoms of mild to moderate di sease, a ten-day therapy with 400 -500 mg metronidazole p. o. q 8 hours is recommended. If no improvement is seen after 3 -5d a y s ,t h e r a p ym u s tb e presumed to have failed, in which case a switch to e. g. vancomy- cin p. o. should be considered. In patients with severe CDI (fever,chills, haemodynamic instability, increased lactate, toxic megacolon), an initial antibiotic therapy with 125 mg vancomycin q 6 hours p. o.for 10 days is recommended. An increased dose of vancomycinoffers no additional benefit [511]. In patients who cannot betreated with oral antibiotics, vancomycin can be administered into the colon (500 mg in 100 mL saline solution q 4 -12 hours) and/or via a nasal tube (500 mg q 6 hours). Ongoing immunosuppressive therapy in patients with CDI should be paused or stopped if pos sible, since IBD patients under immunosuppression have been shown to have an increased mor-bidity (e. g., colectomy, toxic megacolon, bowel perforation) andmortality in comparison to a control group without immunosup-pression [339]. However, it remains unclear whether immunosup- pressive therapy per se denotes a severe disease course with a greater potential for complications. In patients with C. difficile infection whose IBD is not in remis- sion, persisting diarrhoea can hi nder clinical assessment of the response to antibiotic therapy. Renewed microbiological stool diag-nosis cannot be used to measure the success of antibiotic therapy,s i n c eb o t hC .d i f f i c i l ea n dt o x i n sAa n dBc a nb ed e t e c t e di ns t o o leven weeks after successful treatment [512]. However, if a recur-rence of the infection is suspected, stool diagnostics should be repeated. Resistance to metronidazole has been reported and, al-though rare, must be considered in the case of therapy failure [513]. Therapeutic success rates of metronidazole and vancomycin were compared in a retrospective observational study of 62 pa- tients with ulcerative colitis. Patients with mild infections had fewer readmissions to hospital (0 % versus 31 %) and shorter hospital stays(6 versus 14 days) when treated with vancomycin (n = 13) compar-ed to metronidazole therapy (n = 29). Patients with severe infectionalso had fewer readmissions to hospital (0 % versus 70 %), but tend-ed to have longer hospital stays (19 versus 11 days) under vanco-mycin therapy (n = 9) compared to metronidazole therapy (n = 10).This study provided the first evidence to support the administration of vancomycin as primary therapy for CDI in patients with ulcerative colitis [514]. Compared to vancomycin, in patients without IBD, fidaxomicin has a comparable overall primary response rate, but also a lowerrecurrence rate [515, 516]. Its major disadvantage is its high cost.Furthermore, fidaxomicin has not yet been approved for therapyof CDI in patients with IBD. A pharmacokinetic study publishedas a short communication showed no differences in the resorption of fidaxomicin in CDI patients with and without IBD [517]. At the present time, other drug therapies for CDI, such as rifaximin, fusi-dic acid or nitazoxanide, cannot be recommended [518]. Whetherthe additional administration of probiotics during antibiotic ther-apy is protective against CDI in patients with ulcerative colitis, ashas been described for patients without IBD, is unclear [519]. Fulminant CDI has a serious prognosis. Therefore, in patients with severe clinical symptoms, the possibility of surgical intervention should be considered early in the context of interdisciplinary care. Treatment for relapse of CDI is the same as that used in the pri- mary episode. A further relapse should be treated directly with van-comycin 125 mg q 6 hours for 10 days [338]. The procedure in pa-tients with more than two episodes remains unclear. The risk ofrecurrence in these patients is especially high. 40 -60 % of patients who relapse a second time go on to experience further CDI episodes.Based on case series, patients with multiple CDI recurrences have been successfully treated with vancomycin in various tapering and/ or pulse regimens [520]. Theoretical considerations suggest that byadministering vancomycin on alternate days, the clostridial sporesremaining in the intestine can be dispersed on the \"vancomycin- free days \"and be killed off subsequently in their vegetative form. Successful therapeutic transfer of stool from a healthy donor to a patient with CDI was first described as early as 1958 [521].Numerous studies have confirmed the effectiveness of stool transplantation, now known as faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). The first randomised, controlled study showed FMT to besignificantly superior to a conventional relapse therapy with van-comycin in patients with multiple CDI relapse [522]. In this indica-tion, FMT is explicitly recommended in current European guide-lines as a therapeutic alternati ve. A retrospective multicentre study including 31 patients with UC and 35 patients with Crohn 's disease demonstrated FMT to be efficacious in the treatment of CDI, with success rates of 79 % after the first FMT, 88 % after the second FMT und 90 % after the third FMT [523]. For recurring CDI,FMT is probably less effective in IBD patients than in patients with-out IBD. Moreover, approximately 15 -20 % of IBD patients experi- 200 Kucharzik T et ...Z Gastroenterol 2019; 57: 162 -241Leitlinie This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. ence a disease flare after FMT [5 24]. Extraintestinal manifesta- tions of IBD can also occur for the first time in this context [525]. There are still some remaining safety concerns, which it has not been possible to entirely eliminate , despite (cost-intensive) donor screening tests (e. g., for HIV, hepatitis, enteropathogens, stool para- sites, multiresistant pathogens). A national, internet-based registry has been established in Germany to collect additional informationon the clinical efficacy and long-term safety of FMT, including pa-tient characteristics, procedural details of FMT and long-term patientfollow-up data (for details, see: www.kim4.uniklinikum-jena.de). RECOMMENDATION 4.9 If possible, EBV-seronegativ e adult patients should not be treated with thiopurines.Expert consensus, recommendation, consensusIn children, the therapeutic decision represents a specialsituation and requires careful risk assessment.Expert consensus, open recommendation, majority approval Background It is generally accepted that the risk of developing lymphoma is increased in patients with IBD, especially those treated with thio-purines. Findings of the CESAME cohort study, with a populationof 20 000 patients, indicate the risk of lymphoma to be increasedfive-fold under thiopurine therapy [526]. However, the absoluterisk was low, with one additional lymphoma occurring every 300 - 1400 patient years. Nevertheless, the importance of EBV infection is not to be underestimated. In the CESAME cohort of patientstreated with thiopurines, 12 of 15 lymphomas were PTLD-like and,as a rule, associated with EBV. In this situation, primary EBV infec-tion is especially challenging: Of 6 patients under 50 years of age,2 males developed fatal infectious mononucleosis with lymphopro-liferative sequelae [526]. Similar serious complications have reported in casuistic studies [527 patients with EBV (re-)infection, immunosuppressive/immu- nomodulatory therapy should be suspended. Expert consensus, recommendation, consensus RECOMMENDATION 4.11 In patients with EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disease, immunomodulatory therapy with thiopurines should bediscontinued.Expert consensus, recommendation, strong consensus Background In patients who develop a primary EBV infection under immuno- suppression, it is recommended to interrupt immunosuppressivetherapy and, if appropriate, to administer antiviral therapy, in con- sultation with a specialist for infectious diseases. If atypical infil-trates are detected in the intestinal mucosa of patients who areEBV-positive, a reduction in immunosuppression may contributeto the control of virus replication and the disappearance of infil- trates [530]. Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), also known as macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), has beenreported as a severe and potentially lethal complication of acuteEBV infection under thiopurines. A contemporary review summari-ses 50 cases with a mortality rate of 30 % [531]. In addition to theinterruption of immunosuppressive therapy, patients with HLH mayrequire treatment with anti-lymphoproliferative drugs [532 -534]. RECOMMENDATION 4.12 In patients who inadequately respond to drug therapy, espe- cially systemic steroid therapy, diagnostic tests for new onsetor reactivation of CMV infection should be carried out.Expert consensus, recommendation, strong consensus Background The seroprevalence of CMV in the general population is 70 - 100 %, rising with age. Since this figure is the same for patientswith ulcerative colitis, it is not useful to perform screening inde-pendent of the clinical situation. Several studies have shownincreased evidence of CMV in patients under systemic steroidtherapy [326, 535, 536]. In many cases, it is difficult to assess whether steroids facilitate CMV replication or whether pre-exist- ing increased CMV replication leads to the supposed clinical needfor steroid therapy and possible refractoriness. For other immuno-suppressants, such as thiopurines, IL2 inhibitors or TNF antibo-dies, the evidence is even more inconsistent and/or sparse. Inpatients treated with these drugs who show inadequate clinicalimprovement of ulcerative colitis activity and/or signs of systemicCMV infection (particularly fever and leucopoenia), CMV diagnos- tics should likewise be performed. Due to the currently inconsist ent evidence, CMV diagnostics should only be carried out if antiviral therapy is considered usefulupon detection of CMV. This decision depends largely on theseverity of clinical symptoms [331, 537]. RECOMMENDATION 4.13 Diagnostic tests should inclu de immunohistochemical CMV detection from endoscopically obtained samples and/orbiomolecular detection from tissue samples, or biomoleculardetection from whole blood.Evidence grade 3, recommendation grade B, consensus Background CMV diagnosis can be based on whole blood, serum or bioptic sample detection methods. In recent years, direct detection in theinflamed mucosa has become increasingly important (tissueCMV-PCR, immunohistochemical CMV testing), serological 201 Ulcerative ...Z Gastroenterol 2019; 57: 162 -241 This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. methods (serum CMV-IgM) or detection in whole blood (CMV- PCR, pp65) have been less thoroughly researched. Samples forimmunohistochemical or biomolecular analysis should, if possi-ble, be taken from ulcerated tissue -ideally from the base or edge of the ulcer [538 -541]. RECOMMENDATION 4.14 CMV detection alone should not be considered an indication for therapy. The indication for therapy can be justified by theclinical context. Acute therapy should be administered for a minimum of 14 days. Evidence grade 2, recommendation grade B, consensus Background None of the diagnostic procedures has a defined cut-off point after which sufficient diagnostic precision and the necessity forantiviral therapy can be presumed. In addition, tissue CMV detec-tion may not influence the course of ulcerative colitis in patients with mild subclinical CMV reactivation or continual CMV replica- tion. Consequently, evidence of CMV in patients with active ulcerative colitis justifies the necessity for antiviral therapy onlyin the context of the overall clinical picture and in considerationof additional individual factors (e. g. clinical severity of UC activity,duration and intensity of steroid therapy) [56, 57, 542, 543].Since, as yet, there is no accepted cut-off limit for virus load inthe tissue PCR for CMV, the possibility of false-positive results must be considered, especially when titres are low. There is no approved drug therapy for CMV colitis or CMV reac- tivation in patients Common off-label appli-cations are 5 mg/kg ganciclovir i. v. q 12 hours, or a primary (or sec-ondary, after successful primary response to ganciclovir) oraltherapy with 900 mg valganciclovir q 12 hours for 2 (to 3) weeks.In case of insufficient response, a 2 -3 week therapy with foscarnet (e. g. 60 mg q 8 hours i. v. over at least one hour) can be considered, whereby its inferior side-effect profile must be kept in mind [544]. The extent to which a \"prophylactic \"daily dose of e. g. 450 mg valganciclovir adjuvant to immunosuppressive therapy may beuseful, and for how long, have not yet been investigated. RECOMMENDATION 4.15 In patients with severe manifestations of CMV disease, in particular severe CMV colitis, meningoencephalitis, pneumo-nitis or hepatitis, concurrent immunosuppression should be interrupted at least until the virus is no longer detectable. Ifsymptoms of ulcerative colitis relapse with CMV detectionare limited to the intestine, immunosuppressive therapy canbe continued or modified.Evidence grade 2, recommendation grade B, strong consensus Background Even after detailed clinical differentiation, it is often impossible to define CMV as the sole cause of an acute and possibly steroid re-fractory flare of ulcerative colitis on the basis of positive CMV detec- tion in the inflamed tissue. Therefore, an individualised multimodaltherapy with e. g. thiopurines or TNF antibodies should be adminis-tered concomitant or subsequent to antiviral therapy [542]. Cur-rent data indicate the risk of exacerbating a CMV infection or requiring colectomy under concurrent immunosuppression to be relatively low [545]. If results of plasma CMV PCR under antiviraltherapy turn negative in the context of inadequate clinical improve-ment of ulcerative colitis, it may possibly be taken as a signal for theintensification of immunosuppressive therapy [544]. Intensificationof therapy with a TNF antibody is -in comparison to azathioprine - associated with a markedly lower increase in the viral load of CMV.In the light of the increased risk of later colectomy in UC patients with clinically relevant CMV reactivation, it may be appropriate to consider proctocolectomy, e ven at this early stage [546]. Patients with severe intestinal and extraintestinal manifestations of CMV infection -both of which are frequently accompanied by fever -should be admitted to a clinic with interdisciplinary exper- tise. In line with the guidelines of the \"Transplantation Society International CMV Consensus Group \", we would suggest reducing or interrupting immunosuppressive therapy in this situation [547]. RECOMMENDATION 4.16 Upon reintroduction, continuation or intensification of immu- nosuppressive therapy, patients with confirmed CMV diseaseshould receive a prophylactic therapy to prevent disease recurrence. This therapy should be administered for 4 -8 weeks subsequent to completion of the acute therapy.Expert consensus, recommendation grade B, strong consensus Background There is no prospective randomised study evaluating the usefulness of antiviral prophylaxis for relapse prevention followingsuccessful elimination of the virus of clinically relevant CMV infection in patients with UC and subsequent reintroduction or modification of immunosuppressive therapy. Based on recom-mendations from transplantation medicine, a daily dose of 450 - 900 mg valganciclovir may be administered as a prophylaxisagainst disease recurrence [547]. RECOMMENDATION 4.17 Immunosuppressive therapy should not be initiated in patients with an active VZV infection.Expert consensus, recommendation, strong consensus RECOMMENDATION 4.18 If active VZV infection arises during immunosuppressive ther- apy, it should be treated immediately. If possible, immunosup-pressive therapy should be interrupted. Expert consensus, recommendation, strong consensus 202 Kucharzik T et al. Updated S3-Guideline Ulcerative ...Z Gastroenterol 2019; 57: 162 -241Leitlinie This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. Background At initial diagnosis, all pati ents should be questioned with regard to their past medical history for VZV, and their vaccinationpass should be checked for immunisation against varicella. Under immunosuppression, acute chicken pox infection has a pro- nounced risk of complications (e. g., varicella pneumonia) withincreased mortality. Thus, patients without a history of chickenpox and without VZV titre should, if possible, be vaccinated beforebeginning immunosuppressive therapy. Much more common inadult patients is the reactivated form of VZV, which carries a riskof long-term neurological complications (neuralgia) [548]. The duration and application route (oral or i. v.) of therapy with antiviral substances (e. g., aciclovir 5 \u00d7 800 mg, valaciclovir 3\u00d71 0 0 0m g , f a m c i c l o v i r 3\u00d72 5 0m g , b r i v u d i n e 1\u00d71 2 5m g )depends on the severity of disease. As a rule, a therapy durationof 5 -10 days, or until skin lesions have formed a crust, is suffi- cient [549]. Immunosuppression can then be recommenced if nonew efflorescence arises, in other words, if all lesions have crustedover. There are, as yet, no data to support the continuation of an-tiviral therapy in a \"prophylactic \"dose. Passive immunisation with VZV immunoglobulin should be con- sidered within 3 days of exposition in immunosuppressed patients (e. g. a mother under thiopurine/TNF antibody therapy) with a highrisk of infection and complications (combined immunosuppression,close contact with infected individuals, advanced age). RECOMMENDATION 4.19 If a latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is detected by interferon gamma release assay (IGRA), chemopreventive therapy withisoniazid should be carried out according to the recommenda-tions of the RKI. Expert consensus, strong recommendation, strong consensusImmunosuppressive therapy should not be initiated until atleast 4 weeks after chemopreventive therapy is started. Expert consensus, recommendation, strong consensus Background Recommended is a therapy with 5 mg/kg (maximum 300 mg) isoniazid (INH) daily for 9 months. In rare instances, patientsreceiving this therapy can develop INH hepatitis (0.15 %). Patientsintolerant to isoniazid can alternatively be administered a chemo-p r e v e n t i v et h e r a p yw i t hr i f a m p i c i no v e rad u r a t i o no f4m o n t h s , whereby this regimen has been inadequately evaluated in patients under TNF inhibition. If the patient has immigrated from a coun-try where INH resistance is known to be high (e. g., Russia),chemopreventive therapy with rifampicin and pyrazinamide over3 months is recommended. RECOMMENDATION 4.20 If active tuberculosis is confirmed, combination therapy is to be initiated in accordance with RKI guidelines.Expert consensus, strong recommendationImmunosuppressive therapy, especially anti-TNF therapy, should ideally only be initiated after the completion of tuber-culosis therapy, and if so, always on the basis of restrictiveindication criteria.Expert consensus, recommendation, strong consensus Background Concerning the treatment of active tuberculosis, we recom- mend referring to guidelines issued by the RKI German Central Committee for the Control of Tuberculosis, or the current Ameri-can guideline [550, 551]. Whether it is possible to initiate TNFantibody therapy during ongoing tuberculostatic therapy is notknown. Anti-TNF therapy should ideally not be introduced untilafter the completion of tuberculosis therapy. Especially in thissituation, a critical discussion with the patient and the applicationof restrictive indication criteria are advised. RECOMMENDATION 4.21 New-born babies of mothers treated with TNF antibodies dur- ing pregnancy should not be immunised with live vaccines(rotavirus) for at least 9 months. Expert consensus, strong recommendation, strong consensus Background TNF antibodies (with the exception of Certolizumab) cross through the placenta and thus reach therapeutic levels in the foe-tus. Trough levels in new-borns at birth depend upon the time-point of the last application during pregnancy [552]. The majorityof immunisations recommended by the STIKO (Constant Commit- tee on Vaccination, Robert Koch Institute) during the first few months of life are based on non-live vaccines. These are consid-ered to be safe. For the past few years, however, the recommen-dations have included a live oral immunisation against rotavirusduring the first few weeks. This must be avoided. Mothers needto be made aware of this during pregnancy. Live vaccinations formeasles, mumps, rubella and varicella are not recommended untilthe age of 11 -14 months, and are thus generally unproblematic, since by this time there is total clearance of the drug in the baby. 5. Surgery 5.1 Surgical Techniques RECOMMENDATION 5.1.1 Restorative proctocolectomy should be performed as the standard surgical procedure.Evidence grade 3, recommendation grade B, strong consensus 203 Kucharzik T et al. Updated S3-Guideline Ulcerative ...Z Gastroenterol 2019; 57: 162 -241 This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. Background Over the past 35 years, restorative proctocolectomy has become established as the standard surgical procedure in patientswith therapy-refractory ulcerative colitis or development ofulcerative colitis-associated colorectal cancer. Ileoanal pouch surgery provides the best possible quality of life for the patient, with an average of 5 -6 stools per day, and maintains continence in over 90 % of patients [553, 554]. RECOMMENDATION 5.1.2 As a rule, restorative proctocolectomy should be performed using a protective ileostoma. A single-step procedure shouldonly be carried out in selected cases.Evidence grade 2, recommendation grade B, strong consensus Background Anastomotic insufficiency occurs in 10 % of patients who have undergone ileopouch-anal anastomosis. Both the absolute preval- ence rate and the clinical implications of such leaks can potentially be reduced by a protective stoma. While leaks are presumed tocompromise the eventual pouch function, the evidence is conflict-ing. RCTs with a sufficiently large population are not available. Alarge contemporary registry study from Denmark with a 33-yeartime horizon demonstrated a significant association between sur-gery without protective stoma and subsequent pouch failure [555]. In order to identify selection criteria to define cases where a pro- tective stoma may be unnecessary (single-step procedure), two \"high-volume \"centres jointly analysed their pouch databanks. Just under 15 % of the 3733 patients had received no protective stoma.Forgoing stoma construction was significantly associated with sta-pler anastomosis, steroids in the preoperative medication,familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) or carcinoma as the indica-tion for surgery, female gender and age below 26 years. Postopera-tive morbidity, including the rate of anastomotic insufficiency, did not differ between patients with and without stoma [556] . In conclusion, in patients undergoing restorative proctocolect- omy due to therapy refractory disease, a stoma should generallybe used, since the potential disadvantages of a stoma are morethan compensated for by their advantages in these patients whoare, as a rule, seriously ill [557]. RECOMMENDATION 5.1.3 The J-pouch should be the pouch construction of choice, since it is the simplest to create and offers a function similar toother constructs in the long-term.Evidence grade 1, recommendation grade B, strong consensus Background The available studies show no clear functional advantage for the J-design. In a meta-analysis of 18 non-randomised studies(NRS) with a total of 1519 patients, there was no difference inthe rate of early post-operative complications. With respect tostool frequency, the W- and the S-pouch were superior to the J-pouch, whereas the S-pouch w as found to have disadvantages in terms of pouch emptying disturbances [558]. In a more recentrandomised study (W- versus J-pouch), the median 24-hour stoolfrequency after one year was significantly higher for the J-pouch than the W-pouch (7 vs. 5). However, after 9 years, there was no significant difference. All other parameters which were evaluated,including incontinence, use of incontinence pads and quality oflife, were similar [559]. The K-pouch was compared with theJ-pouch in a small randomised study from Norway, whereby nosignificant functional differences were found [560]. Although the studies mentioned above suggest that other pouch configurations tend to have advantages, especially in the short term, the J-pouch remains the standard pouch due to its simple design. Furthermore, pouch emptying problems, whichare clinically very agonising and occur in a considerable propor-tion of patients with S- or W-pouch, appear to have been largelyneglected in the available studies. RECOMMENDATION 5.1.4 Free or contained perforation should be considered an emer- gency indication for surgery.Evidence grade 2, recommendation grade B, strong consensus Background Free or contained perforation is the most severe complication of ulcerative colitis. Evaluation o f clinical symptoms is frequently hampered by concurrent immunosup pressive or antibiotic ther- apy. Therefore, operative therapy should be performed beforethe onset of septic complications. In half of affected patients, per-foration is not preceded by a megacolon. Despite surgical therapy,perforation currently bears a mortality rate of up to 27 % [561,562]. The most crucial factor in reducing the mortality of thisextremely severe complication is timely surgery [319, 392, 563]. In emergency surgery, colectomy with blind closure of the rectum and permanent ileostoma is the primary standard procedure (seealso 5.1.5. and 5.1.6.) [564, 565]. RECOMMENDATION 5.1.5 Patients with a persistent need for transfusion due to therapy-re- fractory bleeding should undergo surgery as a matter of urgency. Evidence grade 2, recommendation grade B, strong consensus Background Severe bleeding occurs with an incidence of up to 4.5 % in patients with UC [566] and accounts for up to 5 % of emergencycolectomies. Indications for surgery are massive initial bleedingwith circulatory instability requiring treatment with catechol- amine, or a persisting transfusion requirement of more than 4 er- ythrocyte concentrates per 24 hours. In children, the need for45-60 mL erythrocyte concentrate (EC)/kg BW in 24 hours, or in case of continued bleeding, 30 mL EC/kg BW over 2 -3 days, must 204 Kucharzik T et al. Updated S3-Guideline Ulcerative ...Z Gastroenterol 2019; 57: 162 -241Leitlinie This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. be considered life-threatening. If possible, children with a severe acute flare of ulcerative colitis should be referred to a paediatricunit with gastroenterological and surgical expertise. Should oneof the aforementioned constella tions arise, the patient should undergo urgent colectomy (within 24 hours), usually as a subtotal colectomy with resection in the proximal Patients with a fulminant flare refractory to drug therapy should undergo urgent surgery. Evidence grade 3, recommendation grade B, strong consensus Background Diagnosis of the refractory fulminant flare is interdisciplinary and based on the criteria of severe colitis according to Trueloveand Witts. However, there is no uniform definition. Interpretationof the literature is therefore difficult. Radiologically, colon dilata-tion of 6 cm indicates a toxic megacolon [ 323, 567]. A therapy-re- fractive fulminant flare is, at minimum, a relative indication for surgery if no substantial improvement in disease intensity can beachieved, in spite of conservative intensive care and drug therapywith high-dose steroids over a duration of 72 hours. Surgical ther-apy is a useful alternative to the further intensification of drugtherapy with calcineurin inhibitors or TNF antibodies. It should betaken into consideration that an additional intensification of drugtherapy with calcineurin inhibitors or TNF antibodies can delay the need for surgery for at least 1 year only in up to 42 -65 % of cases [399, 568]. In a multivariate analysis, it has also been shown thatlater surgery (8 versus 5 days) leads to a significant increase inmajor complications in severe, acute colitis [319]. In conclusion, in patients with fulminant colitis, intensified drug therapy can be applied for a maximum of 5 -7 days, as long as the patient 's condition does not deteriorate. Patients who deteriorate under therapy require urgent surgery within 24 hours, in order to minimise mortality and morbidity. The time frame for conservative therapy in patients with toxic megacolon is considerably more lim-ited, and should not exceed 48 to 72 hours, at a maximum. Hereagain, patients who deteriorate or fail to improve under therapyshould undergo surgery as a matter of urgency [562]. Children with a fulminant flare of ulcerative colitis should be referred to a specialist paediatric unit with gastroenterologicaland surgical expertise. Fulminant colitis is rare in children, and the clinical symptoms differ considerably from those commonly seen in adults. Calculation of the paediatric ulcerative colitis activ-ity index (PUCAI) can be useful [569]. A PUCAI score of 45 pointsor more on day 3, or 70 or more on day 5, indicates \"non-response to steroids \"with high sensitivity and specificity [570]. RECOMMENDATION 5.1.7 Patients whose disease is refractory to immunosuppressants or biologics should undergo surgery.Evidence grade 2, recommendation grade B, strong consensusBackground Failure of intensified conservative therapy (immunosuppres- sants and/or biologics) is an indication for surgical removal of thecolon. The operation can be a two- or three-step procedure,depending on the duration and intensity of premedication and the clinical symptoms. Patients with therapy refractory disease should receive interdisciplinary gastroenterological and surgicalcare from an early stage. Overall, the definition of therapy-refrac-tory disease varies in the real clinical world, as a result of whichpatients often do not receive a recommendation for surgery as aserious alternative to intensification of drug therapy until it is toolate. However, protracted therapy leads to increased morbidity inpatients with severe disease [57 1]. For this reason, intensified conservative therapy should only be pursued for a limited period of time. This is confirmed by a study from M\u00fcnster, in which, inretrospect, over 50 % of patients would have preferred an earlieroperation [572]. A more recent meta-analysis investigating theusefulness of third-line therapies in patients with severe chroniccolitis showed that, although a short-term improvement mayoccur, in general, the necessity for colectomy is only delayed andthe rate of side-effects increased [ 573]. RECOMMENDATION 5.1.8 Elective surgery can be performed at the request of the patient. In this instance, the risks of conservative therapeuticstrategies are to be weighed up against the risks of surgery. Evidence grade 4, recommendation strength 0, strong consensus Background Surgery represents a good alternative to long years of conser- vative drug therapy. In the long t erm, despite all of its possible complications, restorative proctocolectomy with ileoanal pouchallows over 90 % of patients to achieve a good quality of life.Patients who benefit especially from colectomy include those who continually feel ill and those who have poor adherence to drug therapy or fear of carcinoma [553, 554, 566]. A current case-control study comparing patients after pouch sur- gery versus patients under anti-TNF therapy detected no difference inquality of life (IBDQ). However, pouch patients had higher \"QUALIs \" and the overall costs for the health services were lower [574]. Intensive consultation with a vi sceral surgeon experienced in pouch surgery is a prerequisite for elective operation. Functional symptoms should be ruled out before making the decision in favour of surgery. RECOMMENDATION 5.1.9 In children and adolescents with active colitis and growth impairment despite adequate therapy, following consultation with a paediatric gastroenterologist and after other causes have been ruled out, proctocolectomy with pouch-analanastomosis s hould be performed. Evidence grade 4, recommendation grade B, consensus 205 Kucharzik T et al. Updated S3-Guideline Ulcerative ...Z Gastroenterol 2019; 57: 162 -241 This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. Background In children and adolescents with ulcerative colitis, growth impairment is much less frequent than in patients with Crohn 's disease, and generally arises as a consequence of continualinflammatory activity or steroid therapy given for too long and at unnecessarily high doses, which must be avoided at all costs. Other causes of growth impairment (e. g. coeliac disease, growthhormone deficiency, constitutional growth retardation) must beruled out prior to surgery. The drug therapy and indication foroperation should be co-assessed by a paediatric gastroenterolo-gist. Growth recovery after surgery is only to be expected inpre-pubertal children, or children in the early stages of puberty.Thus, although data are sparse, a strong recommendation appears justified [575]. RECOMMENDATION 5.1.10 In patients with an increased perioperative risk profile, depending on perioperative me dication, proctocolectomy should be performed as a three-stage procedure. Evidence grade 3, recommendation grade B, strong consensus Background The three-stage operative procedure involves 1) subtotal colectomy with end ileostoma, 2) rest-proctomucosectomy withileoanal pouch temporal loop ileostoma and 3) closureof the ileostoma. In patients with an increased perioperative risk profile, the three-stage operation is associated with a lower overall rate of complications than one- or two-stage procedures [576 - 578]. Perioperative risk can be i ncreased as a result of long-term steroid therapy, biologic therapy, immunosuppression, malnutri-tion (see recommendations 6.1.2 -6.1.9), or concomitant illness [391, 579]. The intake of more than 20 mg prednisolone over aduration of more than 6 weeks is associated with an increased riskof surgery-related complications. If possible, the steroid dose should be reduced prior to surge ry, taking care to avoid the devel- opment of a steroid withdrawal syndrome. In children, a dose of15 mg/m 2body surface (or 0.5 mg/kg) is to be applied in analogy. A few studies have shown patients under anti-TNF therapy to havean increased risk of postoperative complications. Furthermore,three-stage procedures are more often performed in patientsreceiving TNF antibodies than in patients not under biologic ther-apy. Therefore, a potentially negative effect of these drugs on the risk of perioperative complications may be underestimated due to the choice of the least risky surgical procedure (i. e., colectomywith ileostomy) [580]. In the absence of prospective randomisedstudies, it remains unclear whether the increased rate of complica-tions may rather be due to the presence of severe disease inpatients then treated with biologics. In several case-control studies,an increased number of operative complications (e. g. pouch oranastomotic insufficiency) and septic complications was observed [391, 577, 581]. Two meta-analyses have been carried out on the subject, both of which concluded that, if all operations were inclu-ded, TNF antibodies had no detectable effect on the perioperativecomplication risk [582, 583]. In the later of these meta-analyses,however, a subanalysis of patients who had undergone pouch surgery revealed anti-TNF therapy to have a significant influenceon the rates of both early and late pouch-specific complications.This correlation was confirmed in a contemporary analysis of a pop-ulation of 2000 patients drawn from the databanks of US health insurance companies. In this collective, perioperative complications were significantly associated with the intake of infliximab up until90 days prior to pouch surgery [584]. T his is in line with the results of the two largest, statistically most valid case-control studies fromtwo high-volume centres, both of which reported a significantassociation between perioperative complications of restorativeproctocolectomy and anti-TNF therapy up to 3 months prior tosurgery [577, 581]. The available data do not allow a conclusion to be drawn con- cerning the length of time that can be considered a safe intervalbetween the last anti-TNF administration and planned surgery.From a pragmatic point of view, an interval of at least 4 weeksseems appropriate. A possible explanation for the contradictoryresults of the available analyses may be variations in the serumlevels of anti-TNF antibodies in the respective study patients[585]. Further investigations are needed to determine whether preoperative trough level measurements may be a useful aid in determining when surgery can safely be performed. Ongoing therapy with azathioprine is not associated with an increased risk of postoperative complications. A case series inpaediatric patients detected no difference in the rate of post-operative complications with versus without preoperative per- formed as far as the rectosigmoid junction.Expert consensus, recommendation, strong consensus Background The high rate of complications under intensified drug therapy necessitates three-stage proctocolectomy, a procedure associatedwith fewer complications. Since removal of the rectum is the opera-tive procedure which carries the highest risk and represents thegreatest burden for the patient, in a first step, subtotal colectomywith end ileostoma should be performed. Care should be taken toremove as much inflammation-bearing colon as possible. As a rule, resection as far as the rectosigmoid junction fulfils these criteria and makes rest-proctectomy relatively simple from a technicalpoint of view. A lower resection should be avoided, since it bears adistinctly increased risk of nerve injury in the subsequent operativestages. Closure of the rectal stump is performed either as a blindclosure (Hartmann procedure), or through the creation of amucous fistula by exteriorising the rectosigmoid remnant in theleft lower abdomen. Utilisation of the latter variant avoids a possi- ble insufficiency of the Hartmann stump and offers in addition the possibility of topical drug application (e. g. corticoids, mesalazine)via the sigmoid opening between the second and third stages ofthe operation. However, the partial retention of the sigma also 206 Kucharzik T et al. Updated S3-Guideline Ulcerative ...Z Gastroenterol 2019; 57: 162 -241Leitlinie This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. results in more of the diseased bowel being left intact and the mucous fistula exteriorisation as a second stoma causes furtherweakening of the abdominal wall. In addition, the risk of stomacomplications (e. g. stomal dehiscence) in these patients, whosesigma has been altered by severe inflammation, is considerable. This approach should therefore only be applied in exceptional cases [587 -589]. RECOMMENDATION 5.1.13 In patients with a benign indication for surgery, resection should preserve the mesorectum, if technically possible, in order to keep the rate of complications, including nerve injuries, to aminimum. Evidence grade 2, recommendation grade B, strong consensus Background The available data from an RCT, a case-control study and cohort studies indicate that preservation of the mesorectum leads to a better quality of life, an improved sphincter function and a lower rate of complications [590 -592]. Since close rectal resection usually avoids the risk of nerve lesions, it would seemadvisable to perform close rectal resection, as a rule, in patientsw i t hab e n i g ni n d i c a t i o nf o rs u r g e r y ,e v e nt h o u g ha c c e s sc a nb emore difficult, especially in the narrower male pelvis. RECOMMENDATION 5.1.14 The rectal mucosa retained during ileoanal pouch surgery should be no longer than 2 cm in length.Expert consensus, recommendation, strong consensus Background The last 2 cm oral of the linea dentata are functionally important and therefore of particular importance for patient quality of life. The anal transitional zone, which plays a major role in nocturnalcontinence, is situated within the last 2 cm oral of the linea dentata.When choosing the surgical approach, however, the postoperativerisk of recurring/persistent proctitis must kept in mind. Since the severity of disease and symptoms and the risk of relapse and/or persistent infla mmation correlate exponentially with the length of the remnant rectal mucosa ( \"cuffitis \"), the length of the spared rectal mucosa should not be more than 2 cm. If inflammation arises within the remaining rectal mucosa,a topical therapy can be applied (see recommendation 5.2.6). Although prospective randomised studies of adequate size com- paring the techniques are lacking, the stapler anastomosis withretention of the anal transitional zone seems to have functionaladvantages over manual suturing. The evidence to date is inconclu-sive, a fact reflected in the two available, qualitatively mediocre meta-analyses [593, 594]. The smaller of these analyses, which concentrated explicitly on postoperative function and included4 RCTs, found no advantage for either of the two methods. Thelarger analysis focused not only on complications, but also on func-tional and long-term outcomes, including data from 4183 patients from 21 studies, the majority of which were not randomised. Thecomplications did not differ significantly, whereas functionalparameters indicated significant disadvantages in the hand-suturedgroup in terms of nocturnal continence and the necessity to wear incontinence pads. However, the se disadvantages were put into perspective when only the high-quality studies were evaluated.Regarding the development of dysplasia in the anal transitionzone, a statistical trend was observed to the disadvantage of thestapler group. These findings appear logical, since, if stapledsutures are applied, more residual rectum mucosa remains, thusthere is more potential for malignant degeneration. On the otherhand, it must be kept in mind that even after mucosectomy with manual suturing, rectal mucosa remains in the form of islands of mucous membrane [595]. Every surgeon who carries out restorative proctocolectomy must be capable of manual transanal suturing, in case the stapleranastomosis should fail for technical reasons. RECOMMENDATION 5.1.15 If the indication for surgery is intraepithelial neoplasia or mani- fest rectal carcinoma, complete mucosectomy with anastomosisat the linea dentata should be performed. Evidence grade 3, recommendation grade B, strong consensus Background More than 50 cases of pouch carcinoma have been described in the literature. In the majority of these published cases, pouchcarcinoma developed within the residual rectal mucosa [596,597]. For pragmatic reasons, therefore, in patients with existingrisks such as intraepithelial neoplasia or manifest rectal carcino-ma, the entire rectal mucosa should be radically removed.Controversy remains as to whether mucosectomy s hould also be generally performed in patients with neoplasia of the colon. A retrospective cohort study from Canada evaluated data from 81 patients who had undergone restorative proctocolectomywith ileoanal pouch due to ulcerative colitis-associated dysplasia(n = 52) or carcinoma (n = 29). In this cohort, the incidence ofpouch carcinoma or pouch dysplasia was found to be no higherin patients with stapled sutures (n = 59) than in patients with man-ual sutures [598]. Two patients with manual suturing developed acarcinoma in the rectal mucosa remnant or in the pouch, whereas in the stapler group, not a single patient developed carcinoma of the pouch or anastomosis. The authors conclude that mucosect-omy with manual suturing has no prognostic advantage inpatients undergoing surgery due to neoplasia who could equallybe operated using stapled sutures, assuming that -as in this study -an average of only a little over 1 cm of remnant mucosa is spared. Finally, however, there are no data that clearly demon-strate oncological long-term benefits for mucosectomy with man- ual suturing. For this reason, the ECCO consensus guideline on surgery in ulcerative colitis also no longer contains an explicit gen-eral recommendation for mucosectomy in patients with colorec-tal neoplasia, unless neoplasia is located in the lower rectum 207 Kucharzik T et al. Updated S3-Guideline Ulcerative ...Z Gastroenterol 2019; 57: 162 -241 This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. [599]. Nevertheless, the largest available meta-analysis to investi- gate the occurrence of dysplasia in the anal transition zone showsa statistical trend toward a higher incidence in the stapler group.Thus, from a pragmatic perspective, the recommendation formucosectomy still appears justified, at least in patients with rectal neoplasia [593]. RECOMMENDATION 5.1.16 Pouch surgery should only be carried out in specialised centres. Evidence grade 2, recommendation grade B, strong consensus Background Restorative proctocolectomy with ileum J-pouch/anal recon- struction is a complex and technically demanding procedurewhich requires long years of experience and a high degree ofexpertise, in both the pre- and postoperative phases [600]. Datafrom several studies provide evidence that mortality, morbidityand long-term pouch retention correlate significantly with the number of pouch operations carried out at the respective hospital [601 -603]. Minimum volume regulations have been in place for several years for procedures of comparable complexity (pancreas,oesophagus), stipulating, as a rule, a minimum of ten proceduresannually. For ileoanal pouch surgery, the rate of pouch failure hasbeen shown to drop significantly in centres performing more than8 (versus < 8), and more than 20 (versus 5) operations per centre per year [ 555, 602]. For pragmatic reasons, therefore, the require- ment for a minimum of 10 pouch procedures per year per centre would seem judicious. RECOMMENDATION 5.1.17 Patients with chronic pouchitis or previous ulcerative colitis- associated carcinoma or intraepithelial neoplasia should undergo annual endoscopic surveillance. Evidence grade 4, recommendation grade B, strong consensus Background Even after macroscopically complete mucosectomy, tiniest remnants of mucosa nevertheless pose a continuing risk [595].These mucosal islands can be the source of intraepithelial neopla-sia or carcinoma [597, 604]. For this reason, patients operated due to intraepithelial neoplasia or carcinoma require annual fol- low-up. Although there is no cer tain evidence that, in the long run, chronic pouchitis leads to malign degradation, annual post-operative endoscopic surveillance nonetheless seems sensible inthis situation. In addition, this s pecial group of patients requires close contact with the treating physician in order to improve qual-ity of life with an existing pouch.RECOMMENDATION 5.1.18 Colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis should only be recom- mended in special constellations, e. g., in patients wishing tohave children.Evidence grade 3, recommendation grade B, strong consensus Background Proctocolectomy with ileoanal pouch construction is associated with an increased rate of infertility in both women and men. It is unclear whether the fertility rate is reduced in men with benign in- dications for surgery who have undergone close rectal dissection.In fact, a large current register study from Denmark with 27 379 pa-tients shows that restorative proctocolectomy leads to a reductionin birth rates in females and an increase in birth rates in males[605]. In patients wishing to have children who have an indicationfor surgery, and in women additionally as a temporary solution untilcompletion of family planning, subtotal colectomy with end ileos- toma, or ileorectostomy, should be discussed as alternatives. The basic prerequisite for ileorectostomy, however, is that the residualrectum is by and large inflammation-free and thus suitable for anas-tomosis. Patients should be made fully aware that in approximately50 % of cases, restcolectomy is required, and that quality of lifeafter ileorectostomy is not better than after pouch surgery. A large,recent study from France also showed that in 80 % of patients whoreceived therapy with immunosuppressants and biologics prior to operation (which is nowadays almost always the case if the surgical indication is a \"therapy-refractory situation \"), the ileorectostomy had to be abandoned within 10 years [606]. Moreover, patientswho have undergone ileorectostomy often continue to suffersymptoms of urgency, one of the most distressing symptoms ex-perienced by colitis patients even with an intact colon be performed at a later time with re- sults as good as in patients with primary pouch construction [609]. Due to the rarity of ileorectostomy in children, surgery in paediatric patients should be carried out at a centre specialisedin visceral surgery, preferably in cooperation with paediatricsurgeons. Postoperative care should always be provided by, or inclose cooperation with, paediatric gastroenterologists. RECOMMENDATION 5.1.19 In special cases, the continent \"Kock \"ileostoma can be offered as a possible alternative. Evidence grade 4, recommendation grade 0, strong consensus It should be carried out in centres specialised in this technique. Expert consensus, recommendation, strong consensus Background The Kock ileostoma, a continent ileostoma, involves a techni- cally complicated operative procedure with high rates of bothfunctional complications and surgical revision. The Kock ileosto-ma offers a better patient quality of life in comparison to the 208 Kucharzik T et al. Updated S3-Guideline Ulcerative ...Z Gastroenterol 2019; 57: 162 -241Leitlinie This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. common, non-continent ileostoma, as well as improved physical comfort [610 -612]. In patients who experience pouch failure a n de x p r e s sas t r o n gd e s i r ef o rt h e operation, conversion to the continent Kock ileostoma can be performed [613]. RECOMMENDATION 5.1.20 In patients who have undergone ileorectal anastomosis with sparing of the rectum, and patients with end ileostoma andblind rectal closure (Hartmann), the frequency of endoscopicmonitoring should be chosen according to the initial indica- tion for surgery. Monitoring colonoscopy s hould be consistent with the recommendation for general colonoscopy screeningin ulcerative colitis.Evidence grade 3, recommendation grade B, consensus Background In principle, as long as part of th e rectum is spared, the risk of malignancy remains, and regular endoscopic monitoring with biop- sies is indicated [614]. The ideal frequency of monitoring has not yet been adequately defined in studies. From a pragmatic perspec-tive, the frequency recommended for ulcerative colitis monitoringseems appropriate (if there are risk factors for neoplastic lesions,see statement 2.31 and/or Table 6 , otherwise according to the patient 's symptoms and individual disease characteristics). A secondary restorative proctocol ectomy with IPAA s hould generally be discussed with the patient, or possibly stump removal, if pouch creation is contraindicated or rejected by the patient. In any event, if there are classic risk factors for neoplastic changes (dysplasia orneoplasm at the time of the primary operation, PSC), these surgicaloptions should be discussed in detail with the patient. Some pub-lished data indicate that, even in the presence of the above-men-tioned risk factors, the incidence of new neoplasms in the long-term is still very low [615]. Nevertheless, the conflicting evidencein the literature suggests that regular monitoring after ileorectost- omy or Hartmann stump construction is justified, not least because in comparison to the examination itself, which is unproblematic andassociated only with a minimal risk, an overlooked neoplasm, albeitrare, has negative consequences on a much greater scale. RECOMMENDATION 5.1.21 In elective surgery, laparoscopic restorative proctocolectomy is at least equal to the open surgical procedure, and in somerespects, superior. In female patients wishing to have chil-dren, minimally invasive surgery should be favoured.Evidence grade 3, recommendation grade B, strong consensus Background Laparoscopic restorative proctocolectomy with IPAA is a proce- dure which can be safely performed in an adequately experienced centre. Studies to date show that, while both procedures havecomparable rates of complications, the laparoscopic procedurehas predominantly cosmetic advantages over open restorativeproctocolectomy with IPAA [616, 617]. However, the laparoscopic operation takes longer to perform and therefore potentiallyentails higher procedural costs. A Cochrane review and two newersystematic reviews show that the minimally invasive procedurehas several further advantages in the short term (wound infection rate, more rapid resumption of bowel function) [618 -620]. A number of case-control and cohort studies suggest that fe- male fertility is less impaired by laparoscopic surgery, presumablybecause adhesions occur less frequently [621 -624]. Whether this reduction in postoperative adhesions also leads to fewerepisodes of ileus remains to be determined [625]. Since, in principle, the laparoscopic operation is at least as good as open surgery, has clear cosmetic advantages, and also better preserves female fertility, it should be the method of choice in women of childbearing age. Several case-control studies have shown that the advantages associated with the laparoscopic technique in elective surgeryapply similarly when surgery is performed as a matter of urgencyor emergency [626 -628]. However, since all of these studies, without exception, were carried out in specialised centres,whereas the majority of emergency operations are not performed in such centres, a general recommendation in favour of laparo- scopic access cannot be given at this time. RECOMMENDATION 5.1.22 Patients with indeterminate colitis without anorectal fistula formation, and therefore without the associated indication for surgery, can be offered restorative proctocolectomy afterbeing given a detailed explana tion of the procedure and its associated risks.Evidence grade 3, recommendation grade 0, strong consensus Background In approximately 7 % of patients with colitis, it is not possible to make an exact differentiation between ulcerative colitis and Crohn 's disease [629]. There ar e reports in the literature describing poorer long-term results after proctocolectomy with IPAA in pa-tients with indeterminate colitis. However, these data are in con-trast to other accounts in which the outcomes of patients with in-determinate colitis have been found to be no worse than those ofpatients with ulcerative colitis [630, 631]. A disease after restorative proctocolectomy with IPAA is frequently associated with complications, and in particular with an increased rate of pouch failure. However, this is put into perspectivein the subgroup of patients who had colitis without fistulae andwithout small bowel involvement prior to surgery [632]. Despitethese contradictory data, after thorough discussion with the pa-tient, restorative proctocolectomy with IPAA can be performed. The proportion of children and adolescents with indeterminate colitis lies by up to 22 % [633]. For the most part, the diagnostic classification of the disease as ulcerative colitis or Crohn 's disease will succeed during the course of the disease. Therefore, inchildren requiring ulcerative colitis surgery, it is advisable to carryout a three-stage procedure. 209 Kucharzik Gastroenterol 2019; 57: 162 -241 This document was downloaded for personal use only.

Different forms of pouchitis should be differentiated according tothe temporal progression of disease, as acute, acute-relapsing orchronic pouchitis. Further classification can be made antibiotic-sensitive or -refractory acute pouchi-tis, relapsing pouchitis (e. g., > 3 months) [634, 635]. The diagnosis of acute pouchitis is made on the basis of clinical symptoms (stool frequency, bleeding, fever, pain), taking into account endoscopic (redness, oedema, erosion, examination [636].Acute-relapsing pouchitis is characterised by repeated flares ofinflammation. The diagnosis of chronic pouchitis describes aninflammatory reaction in the pouch, the symptoms and endo-scopic/histologic findings o fw h i c hp e r s i s tf o rm o r et h a n 3 months. The risk of acute pouchitis after restorative proctoco- lectomy with IPAA in patients with ulcerative colitis lies at approxi-mately 30 % in the first two years after surgery. This risk increasesto approximately 50 % during the course of long-term follow-up[637 -643]. In around 5 % of patients with pouchitis, the initial acute disease becomes chronic over time. Existing extraintestinalmanifestations of ulcerative colitis are risk factors for pouchitis,especially PSC [643 -647]. Also associated with an incr eased rate of pouchitis are persistently high inflammatory activity and pre- operative backwash ileitis. Parameters for the diagnosis of acutepouchitis are combined in the Pouc hitis Disease Activity Index (PDAI) [636]. If there are symptoms of pouchitis, but endoscopy,imaging tests and histologic examination fail to identify theircause, assuming other diseases have been ruled out, the diagnosisof irritable pouch syndrome can be made [648]. RECOMMENDATION 5.2.2 In patients with chronic pouchitis, Crohn 'sd i s e a s e ,s u r g i c a l complications and infection should be ruled out.Evidence grade 5, recommendation grade B, strong consensus Background When diagnosing pouchitis, it is recommended to perform examinations to rule out secondary forms of pouchitis. To ruleout surgical causes, computer tomography, magnetic and endosonography are necessary andsuitable [649 -652]. These procedures may need to be repeatedin the course of follow-up. The presence of Crohn fistula or abscess development, anastomotic insufficiency, ischaemia oropportunistic infection should be ruled out. In addition to histo-logic evidence, involvement of the pre-pouch ileum segment(the afferent limb at the pouch inlet) suggests a diagnosis of Crohn 's disease. RECOMMENDATION 5.2.3 Ciprofloxacin or metronidazole should be administered as pri- mary therapy for acute pouchitis. Evidence grade 1, recommendation grade A, strong consensus If monotherapy fails, combination therapy can be used.Evidence grade 3, recommendation grade 0, consensusAntibiotic-refractory disease forms s hould be treated with oral or topical budesonide.Evidence grade 3, recommendation grade B, strong consensusFurther options for therapy can include infliximab, adalimu-mab, vedolizumab, ustekinumab or calcineurin inhibitors, amongst others. Expert consensus, recommendation open, consensus Background A number of randomised controlled studies have focused on drug therapies in pouchitis [653 -656]. The recommendation for therapy of acute pouchitis with antibiotics (metronidazole, cipro-floxacin) is backed up by several studies, albeit small [657 -660]. There is a suggestion that ciprofloxacin may be superior to metro- nidazole therapy [656]. A combination therapy is also possible[661, 662] Since there is insufficient evidence on which to base a recom- mendation for the dosage and duration of antibiotic therapy,these must be tested on an individual basis. The usual dose is2 \u00d7 250 mg up to 2 \u00d7 500 mg/d ciprofloxacin p. o. for 2 weeks or2-3 \u00d7 400 mg metronidazole p. o. In patients intolerant to oral metronidazole, topical metronidazole therapy (suppositories) may be used as an alternative [663]. No recommendation can begiven regarding rifaximin therapy [664]. Patients with antibiotic-refractory pouchitis may benefit from topical budesonide therapy [665]. While topical budesonide is aseffective as a topical metronidazole therapy, it seems to be some-what better tolerated [666]. Therapy with TNF antagonists a nd/or immunosuppressants is possible. In a recently-published review, 19 publications with a total of 192 patients were analysed in this respect [667]. Indica-tions for anti-TNF therapy fistulisingdisease and inflammatory, stenosing forms of pouchitis. Basedon the 3 largest studies included in the analysis (n = 87), thecombined rate of partial and complete response to infliximabtherapy was 84 %-88 % after 6 -10 weeks and 45 %-58 % after 52 weeks [667]. In a retrospective Canadian study, 152 patients with therapy- resistant pouchitis were analysed, of whom 42 were treated withinfliximab. Post-induction response was achieved in 74 % and 210 Kucharzik T et al. Updated S3-Guideline Ulcerative ...Z Gastroenterol 2019; 57: 162 -241Leitlinie This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. long-term response in 62.6 %. Mean PDAI and CRP values showed a statistically significant decrease under therapy [ 668]. The effect of adalimumab was demonstrated in a case series including 48 patients. The combined rate of partial and completeresponse was 71 % and 54 % after median observation times of 8 and 25 weeks, respectively [669]. Among patients with ther- apy-refractive pouchitis and infliximab therapy failure, it waspossible to avert the necessity for permanent ileostoma atweek 52 in 50 % of cases through second-line therapy with adali-mumab [670]. Further therapeutic options in clude ustekinu- mab or calcineurin inhibitors. However, the pertinent studieswere carried out in patients with acute, antibiotic-refractory pouchitis and consist of retrospective data and case series with heterogeneous patient collectives [653, 671 -673]. RECOMMENDATION 5.2.4 In patients with frequently relapsing or chronic pouchitis, intermittent monotherapy or a combined antibiotic therapy with ciprofloxacin and/or metronidazole should be given.Evidence grade 3, recommendation grade B, strong consensusAntibiotic-refractory pouchitis should be treated with oral orlocal budesonide.Evidence grade 3, recommendation grade B, adalimumab,vedolizumab, ustekinumab, rifax imin, calcineurin inhibitors or alicaforsen. Evidence grade 4, recommendation grade 0, consensus Background Patients who fail to respond to metronidazole or ciprofloxacin monotherapy can be treated with an oral combination therapy ofciprofloxacin and metronidazole, or an oral combination therapyof ciprofloxacin and rifaximin [657, 662]. However, the support- ing evidence is weak. In a recent review, the effectiveness of different drug therapies in chronic pouchitis after IPAA in UC patients was evaluated [653].The review included 21 manuscripts. The results showed thatantibiotics led to remission in 74 % of cases (95 % CI:56 -93 %), (P < 0.001), whereas TNF antibodie s achieved remission rates of 53 % (95 % CI:30 -76 %), (P < 0.001). Therapies with steroids, bismuth, elemental diet or tacrolimus also achieved remission, although non-significantly. Local therapy with tacrolimus is described in single case reports. Evidence concerning the use ofFMT in pouchitis is currently insufficient to warrant recommenda-tion, and failed to show induction of -679]. With regard to the bacterial formulation VSL#3, there are a number of older studies that have shown efficacy in the treatment of pouchitis. A pooled analysis o f two studies (76 participants) suggests that VSL#3 is more effective than placebo in remissionmaintenance [680 -682]. Eighty-five per cent (34/40) of patientsunder VSL#3 were able to maintain remission for a period of 9 - 12 months, in contrast to the placebo group, in which only 3 %(1/36) remained in remission (RR 20.24 95 % CI 4.28 to 95.81).However, a GRADE analysis indicated that the evidence was oflow quality low due to the small number of cases [656]. Perianal inflammation and irritation present considerable problems for many patients who have undergone pouch surgery.Diagnosis can often be made on the basis of the past medicalhistory, examination and if necessary, a smear test. Measureswhich can contribute to wound healing include rinsing afterdefaecation or the application of moist tissues free from alcohol,perfume or colourings, optimal skin care, e. g., with panthenol orzinc, nutritional changes, and possibly the use of cholestyramine. RECOMMENDATION 5.2.5 If risk factors are present, an endoscopic surveillance examina- tion should be carried out annually. Otherwise, pouchoscopyshould be performed if symptoms occur, or every 2 years at a minimum. Expert consensus, recommendation, consensus Background This recommendation is not backed up by specific studies in the literature. Based on experience of surveillance strategies priorto restorative proctocolectomy with IPAA, annual endoscopicsurveillance would seem appropriate, even though the pouch carcinoma is a rare entity [683]. Whether monitoring can be performed less frequently in patients who undergo pouch surgery for reasons other thanmalignancy is unclear. As a rule, patients who develop a pouchcarcinoma are those in whom colon or rectum carcinoma wasthe indication for restorative proctocolectomy with IPAA. Pouchcarcinomas usually occur in the remnant mucosa of the anorectaltransition. Thus, from a pragmatic perspective, in patients with a carcinoma of the lower rectum, restorative proctocolectomy should preferably be performed with a complete also statement 5.1.15) [604, 684]. RECOMMENDATION 5.2.6 In cuffitis, topical mesalazine therapy should initially be attempted. Evidence grade 3, recommendation grade B, strong consensusIn patients with therapy-refractory inflammation, endoscopicmucosectomy or rest-proctectomy can be considered.Expert consensus, recommendation, consensus Background C u f f i t i sc a nc a u s ep o u c hd y s f u n c t i o nw i t hs y m p t o m sw h i c h can imitate pouchitis or irritable pouch syndrome (IPS), especially in patients who have undergone double-stapled IPAA. In contrast to IPS (which may occur coincidentally), perianal bleeding is a characteristic sign of cuffitis. Diagnosis can be 211 Kucharzik T et al. Updated S3-Guideline Ulcerative ...Z Gastroenterol 2019; 57: 162 -241 This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. made by endoscopy at the hands of an experienced examiner and histological evaluation of the e pithelial cuff between the linea dentata and the pouch-anal anastomosis [685]. In an open-label study including 14 consecutive patients with cuffitis, the effect of mesalazine 500 mg suppositories was exam- ined in a blinded manner. Compared to placebo, mesalazine led to a significant reduction in the total cuffitis index, as well as in thesymptom, endoscopy and histology subscores. Ninety-two percent of patients with bloody stools and 70 % of patients witharthralgia (a characteristic clinical symptom of cuffitis) respondedto topical mesalazine therapy. There were no reports of systemicor topical side-effects [686]. RECOMMENDATION 5.2.7 Patients with irritable pouch syndrome can be treated in the same way as patients with irritable bowel syndrome.Expert consensus, recommendation open, consensus Background Unlike the therapeutic approach in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), IPS management has not been defined in a treatmentalgorithm. Analogous to patients with irritable bowel syndrome,patients with IPS can be treate d with symptomatic therapies, e. g., dietary modifications, dietary fibres, loperamide, anticonvul-sant drugs and antidepressants [648, 687]. 6. Nutrition and complementary therapies 6.1 Nutrition in the aetiology and prevention of ulcerative colitis RECOMMENDATION 6.1.1 With the exception of breastfeeding, there are no nutritional factors which could be recommended to reduce the risk ofulcerative colitis. Breastfeeding should be continued for atleast six months.Evidence grade 3, recommendation grade B, consensus Background The observation that ulcerative colitis was extremely rare until the end of the 1950 s, and has since then substantially increased inall western industrial nations, led to the presumption thatnutritional changes represent a po ssible cause for the increased incidence of the disease. Retrospective studies have suggested apossible complicity of various fa ctors, including the post-war increase in consumption of refined carbohydrates, chemically processed fats, reduced intake of dietary fibres, and an allergic reaction to baker 's yeast. More recent prospective studies showed a possible association between ulcerative colitis development andan increased consumption of animal protein [688] as well as satu-rated fatty acids and trans fats [682, 689]. On the other hand, asignificant inverse relationship with ulcerative colitis occurrence has been demonstrated with respect to the daily intake of vegeta-bles, omega-3 fatty acids [690] and vitamin D [691]. On the evidence of two systematic reviews dating from 2004 and 2009, only breastfeeding has been proven to result in a significant reduction (23 %) in the risk of later ulcerative colitis development [692, 693]. This was corroborated by two later cohort studies fromNew Zealand [694] and Denmark [695]. Breastfeeding should becontinued for at least 6 months, and if possible, longer [696]. Malnutrition RECOMMENDATION 6.1.2 Patients with ulcerative colitis have an increased risk for malnutrition. Accordingly, they should be assessed withregard to malnutrition at first diagnosis and during follow-up.Evidence grade 2, recommendation grade B, strong consensus Background In many patients with ulcerative colitis, complications due to malnutrition can be a greater source of weakness than the under- lying inflammatory process itself. Therefore, the prevention and treatment of malnutrition are essential elements of IBD therapy. The prevalence of malnutrition in adults with active ulcerative colitis is 7.2 % compared with 1.8 % in healthy controls, represent-ing a five-fold increased risk (OR 5.57; 95 %-KI: 5.29 -5.86). The coherent risk of complications (severe disease, longer hospitalisa-tion) and the treatment costs are also increased [ 697]. Up to 85 % of children with IBD show signs of malnutrition (Crohn 's disease > ulcerative colitis), of whom 15 -40 % have retarded growth [696]. In approximately 25 -80 %, albumin levels are diminished. Depending on the activity and duration ofdisease, 20 -85 % of patients show a negative nitrogen balance. The main cause of total body protein depletion appears to be theexcessive loss of protein through the inflamed bowel mucosa,determinable by measurement of faecal 1-antitrypsin. Protein malabsorption could be an additional contributor. Another possi- ble cause of the negative nitrogen balance is the catabolic effects of drugs such as antibiotics and steroids [698]. RECOMMENDATION 6.1.3 Patients with ulcerative colitis have an increased risk of micro- nutrient deficiency. They should therefore be assessed for micronutrient deficiencies initially and during follow-up whenever there are clinical symptoms or an increased risk ofdeficiency.Evidence grade 2, recommendation grade B, strong consensus Background Depending on the patient collective, disease activity and the choice of biomarker and cut-off point, iron deficiency occurs in 30-70 %, 25-OH-vitamin D deficiency in 40 -60 %, folic acid 212 Kucharzik T et al. Updated S3-Guideline Ulcerative ...Z Gastroenterol 2019; 57: 162 -241Leitlinie This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. deficiency in 5 -10 %, zinc deficiency in 20 -30 % and selenium deficiency in 20 -30 % of patients with ulcerative colitis. In contrast, vitamin B12deficiency has been described only after IAP creation [698 -702]. While the aetiology of vitamin B12deficiency patients with IAP is multifactorial, a diminished resorptive capa- city, as well as bacterial overgrowth, which occurs almost univer- sally as a result of IAP, are suspected to play a role [703]. Nutritional and supplementation therapies RECOMMENDATION 6.1.4 Special enteral nutrition therapy and/or total parenteral nutri- tion should not be administered as a primary therapy for remission induction in patients with ulcerative colitis. Expert consensus, recommendation, strong consensus Background In contrast to Crohn 's disease, there is little or no evidence demonstrating an influence of nutritional therapy (sip feeds, enteraland parenteral feeding) on disease activity in acute or chronically ac-tive ulcerative colitis [704]. In IBD, as in other diseases, the principles of a stepwise approach to nutritional therapy are applicable includ- ing nutritional consultation, complementary feeding in the form ofsip feeds, tube feeding, and parenteral nutrition [704]. When treat-ing children, it is important to bear in mind that nutritional/dietarycounselling alone is not an effective treatment for malnutrition and/or specific deficiencies, or for growth retardation [704]. Enteral nutrition (total or partial) should be given as supplemen- tary therapy, in order to ensure an adequate supply of nutrients dur- ing acute phases of inflammation, especially in patients with signs of existing malnutrition or at high risk for nutritional deficiencies [345]. Nevertheless, especially in patients with fulminant ulcerative colitis, there may be an indication for total parenteral or enteralnutrition with a standard regimen to secure an adequate supplyof nutrients. An influence of specific substrates such as omega-3fatty acids, glutamine or butyrate on disease activity in patientswith ulcerative colitis has not been demonstrated [705 -709]. Assuming that no weight loss occurs, energy requirements are between 25 and 30 kcal/kg BW/day [710]. As a result of the cata-bolic metabolic state resulting from inflammation, and due also tointestinal protein loss, protein requirements are increased to 1 - 1.5 g/kg BW/day, and in patients with sepsis or very severe malnu-trition, up to 2 g/kg BW/day [710]. Total parenteral nutrition (TPN)alone should only be administered to correct severe malnutrition,especially prior to surgery, or if enteral feeding is either impractic- able or unable to provide sufficient calories in patients with complicated disease [711, 712]. RECOMMENDATION 6.1.5 A special diet or nutritional therapy should not be recommended for maintenance of remission. Expert consensus, recommendation, strong consensusBackground While small, uncontrolled studies of nutritional supplements enriched with omega-3 fatty acids have shown a positive effecton remission maintenance in patients with Crohn 'sd i s e a s e ,a general therapeutic recommendation for patients with ulcerative colitis can currently not be derived from these findings [713]. The same is true for the low-sulphite diet suggested by Roediger in themid-90 s for patients with ulcerative colitis, which prescribes theavoidance of foods rich in sulphurous amino-acids [709, 714]. RECOMMENDATION 6.1.6 An isolated micronutrient deficiency be treated by appropriate oral or parenteral supplementation. Routinesubstitution of vitamins or minerals in patients with ulcerativecolitis is not appropriate.Expert consensus, recommendation, strong consensus Background In patients with confirmed micronutrient deficits, specific vitamins and/or minerals should be substituted according to the ap-propriate recommendations [702, 715, 716]. During the remissionphase, nutritional substitution can primarily be administered orally.In the case of intolerance to oral preparations (e. g., iron) or insuffi-cient resorption (iron, vitamin B 12), especially in the presence of sub- stantial inflammatory activity, parenteral substitution is required. Iron should always be supplemented if there is manifest anae- mia. Iron deficiency without manifest anaemia requires an indivi- dualised approach. The choice of timing and type of therapydepends on symptoms, aetiology, severity, dynamics of haemo-globin depletion, comorbidities and risks of therapy [717]. The therapeutic goals of iron substitution in patients with iron deficiency anaemia are to increase the haemoglobin level by morethan 2 mg/dL or up to normal levels within 4 weeks, and toincrease serum ferritin levels to > 100 \u00b5g/L. The universally recom- mended calculation of iron requirements using the Ganzoni formula (total iron deficit (mg) = [target Hb -actual Hb (g/dL)] \u00d7 body weight (kg) \u00d7 2.4 + iron stores (mg)) is inconvenient inroutine practice and underestimates iron requirements, at leastin IBD patients [718]. The recently-published \"FERGIcor \"tool has proved to be simpler and more effective [719]. In principle, iron can be substituted in either of two ways; by oral administration of suitable iron(II, III) compounds or intrave- nous application of iron(III) complexes [718]. Mild iron deficiency anaemia (Hb 11 -13 g/dL) can initially be treated with oral iron therapy of approx. 100 mg/day for 4 weeks.Patients who show intolerance to oral therapy or an inadequatehaemoglobin response, i. e., a n increase of less than 2 g/dL, should be switched to intraven ous iron therapy in good time; since resorption of oral iron is limited, patients with severe anae-mia should always receive intravenous iron substitution, with the aim of normalising haemoglobin values and replenishing iron stores. Absolute indications fo r intravenous iron therapy are [717, 718]: 213 Kucharzik Gastroenterol 2019; 57: 162 -241 This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. Severe anaemia (Hb < 10 g/dL) Intolerance of oral iron or insufficient haemoglobin increase during the first 2 weeks Severe disease activity Adjuvant therapy with erythropoietin-stimulating agents Patient preference Therapy of zinc deficiency Large quantities of zinc are lost in diarrhoea (stool volume > 300 g/ d) or stoma output, whereby some 12 mg elemental zinc may belost per litre of stoma output. This is considerably more than thenormal daily requirement for zinc and more than regular mineralsupplements contain [720, 721]. Pat ients with zinc deficiency should receive 30 to 45 mg oral zinc histidine or zinc gluconate(taken approximately 1 hour before breakfast) [722]. As zinc inter- feres with the intestinal absorption of iron and especially copper, oral supplementation should not be continued for longer than 2 - 3 weeks [723]. If longer supplementation is necessary, 1 mg ele-mentary copper should be substituted along with every 8 - 15 mg elementary zinc. If there is insufficient response, as is fre-quently the case, zinc should be substituted parenterally (e. g. upto 5 mg/day zinc aspartate as mono-injection or infusion additive)[721, 724]. Therapy of vitamin B12deficiency Since only 1 -3 % of cyanocobalamin is resorbed, parenteral appli- cation is generally preferred. Unfortunately, therapy recommen-dations concerning the dosing and application of B 12substitution are still inconsistent and the dosages mostly underestimated. Twomedicinal vitamin B 12preparations are currently available: cyano- cobalamin and hydroxocobalamin. When calculating the dosage,it should be kept in mind that clinical symptoms occur only afterthe body 's vitamin B 12stores (4 -5 mg) are reduced to 5 to 10 % of normal levels. Therefore, the goal of therapy must be to compen- sate this deficit. In order to refill the empty body stores as rapidlyas possible, the following treatment is recommended: In the firstweek, on 5 days, 1000 g hydroxocobalamin i. m./s. c. (of which a p p r o x .4 5 % ,i . e .4 5 0 g, will be resorbed -compared with only 16 % of cyanocobalamin). Over the following month, this isfollowed by weekly injections of 1000 g (alternatively, 500 g hydroxocobalamin daily on 5 days per week for one month). The measurement of homocystein or MMA levels has proved useful in the monitoring of vitamin therapy [718]. Therapy of vitamin D deficiency Recommendations for target levels of 25-OH-vitamin D and for sup-plementation dosage vary [725]. The Endocrine Society recommendsa daily vitamin D intake of 1500 -2000 IE per day in adults, targeting a vitamin D level of > 75 nmol/L (> 30 ng/mL). In certain situations,such as obesity or concomitant intake of anticonvulsive or glucocorti-coid therapy, this dose can be dou bled or even trebled. Especially under glucocorticoid therapy, vitamin D levels can fall, and should therefore either be monitored, or 1000 IE 25-OH-vitamin D should be supplemented daily [726, 727]. Evidence-based recommenda-tions concerning target levels, dosage and duration of vitamin Dsupplementation in patients with IBD are lacking. Garg et al.recommend 1000 -5000 IU/day depending on serum levels, with a multiplying factor of 1.5 -20 in patients with Crohn 's disease of the small bowel and/or obesity. Levels of > 30 ng/mL (75 mmol/L) 25-OH-vitamin D should be sustained. In order to normalise 25-OH levels asquickly as possible (within 2 weeks), Van Groningen et al. suggest an initial repletion dose (IU) = 40 \u00d7 (75-serum-25-OHD 3) \u00d7 BW [728]. The calculated dose is to be administered on 3 weekdays (Mon./Wed./Fri.) in portions of 20 000 IU each, followed by a weekly maintenancedose of 20 000 IU. In general, cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) shouldbe preferred over ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) due to its betterbioavailability [729]. An intake of up to 4000 IE vitamin D3 per day does not necessi- tate monitoring of vitamin D levels, as a rule. Vitamin D toxicity only begins to occur if levels > 150 ng/mL (> 375 nmol/L) are sus- tained [730, 731]. Surgical aspects of nutrition in UC RECOMMENDATION 6.1.7 Before elective surgery, patients with severe malnutrition (BMI < 19, weight loss > 10 % in the last 6 months prior to sur- gery and/or serum albumin < 30 g/L, marked cachexia) should be treated with targeted nutrition therapy for at least 7 days.Expert consensus, recommendation, strong consensus Background Patients with severe malnutrition have a significantly higher risk for postoperative complications [712, 732, 733]. Prior parent-eral nutrition was shown to exert a positive effect only if begun at least 5 days prior to surgery [734]. Targeted preoperative nutri- tion therapy before elective surgery should ther efore be adminis- tered over at least 7 days. Details on the administration of nutri-tional therapy are given in paragraph 6.1.4. Administration ofTPN as a perioperative measure can improve nutrition status andthus reduce postoperative complications [735]. Severe malnutri-tion is present when one or more of the following criteria are met:Weight loss > 10 -15 % within 6 months BMI < 18.5 kg/m 2 Serum albumin < 30 g/L (without impairment of liver or kidney function) If preoperative nutrition therapy is indicated, enteral intake via sip feeds or tube feeding should be preferred. If possible, in order toavoid nosocomial infections, enteral nutrition should be adminis-tered prior to hospitalisation. Parenteral nutrition therapy is generally reserved for patients with severe colon inflammation and intestinal intolerance [736 -738]. RECOMMENDATION 6.1.8 Ulcerative colitis patients with high-output jejuno- or ileostomy should be closely monitored with regard to water and electrolyte levels. Expert consensus, Recommendation, strong consensus 214 Kucharzik T et al. Updated S3-Guideline Ulcerative ...Z Gastroenterol 2019; 57: 162 -241Leitlinie This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. Background The goal of nutrition therapy after ileostomy (depending on the remnant bowel) is to prevent the loss of water and electrolytes andto avoid irritation of the stoma by chemicals from ingested foods. Only after approximately eight (and sometimes even up to twelve) weeks does the consistency of the stool stabilise. However, itremains liquid or soft. In the adaptation phase (see above), cloggingfoods such as potatoes, rice, oatmeal or bananas can have a positiveeffect. Foods which swell by binding liquid, and preparations such aspectin, which increase the viscosity of the stool, may also be useful. The basis of nutrition therapy in patients with ileostomy, dur- ing the gradual reintroduction of liquid and solid foods and the adaption phase, is the adequate intake of fluid and salt. It is important for the patient with ileostomy to know that everyintake of food will lead to the emptying of the stoma. The fluid requirement is approximately 3 litres per day. A gauge of sufficient fluid intake is a urine volume of at least 1 litreper day (urine volume should be regularly monitored). The recom-mended intake of sodium chloride is 6 -9 g per day (e. g., salted meat and vegetable broths). Di etary fibre intake should be approximately 25 -30 g per day [739]. RECOMMENDATION 6.1.9 Patients with a pouch should regularly be monitored for possi- ble deficiencies of vitamin D, vitamin B12 and iron. Expert consensus, recommendation, strong consensus Background Anaemia due to iron and/or vitamin B12deficiency is one of the most frequent extraintestinal manifestations after IAP [740, 741].Depending on definition and methods, iron deficiency has beenreported in 20 -56 % [703, 742] (pouchitis 77 %) [700] of patients, B 12deficiency in 25 %, vitamin D deficiency (< 21 ng/mL) in 22 % and vitamin D insufficiency (< 31 ng/mL) in 70 % [743]. Deficien- cies of vitamin E and/or A occur in up to 5 % of patients in the con- text of fat malabsorption [744]. In patients with longer-term stea-torrhoea, vitamin A and E levels should therefore be determinedat least once. Data on folic acid status are incongruent and donot allow a recommendation to be made [740]. 6.2. Complementary therapies Preamble There is no generally accepted definition of complementary andalternative therapies. The concept of complementary therapy isthat the treatment methods applied are ancillary, i. e., supple-mentary to standard methods. Therapies which preclude the useof standard methods are describe d as alternative therapies. Un- conventional therapies are all treatment methods which are not considered to be approved, accepted or scientifically evaluated. These guidelines will apply the classification of Complemen- tary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) according to Wieland et al.[745] for the Cochrane Collaboration. This classification differenti-ates five categories: (1) mind-body methods, (2) holistic (integra-ted) therapies, (3) herbal therapies, (4) manual and body-related therapies and (5) energy medicine. As a rule, the terminology \"alternative therapies \"does not reflect how these methods are commonly used, since comple-mentary/naturopathic therapies are not intended to be substi- tutes for conventional therapies. Rather than differentiating between alternative and complementary medicine, the Anglo-American literature uses the collective term \"complementary and alternative medicine \"(CAM), which has now found wide acceptance internationally. To describe the combined applicationof conventional and complementary methods, more recent litera-ture has adopted the term \"integrative medicine \" RECOMMENDATION 6.2.1 The use of alternative therapies instead of a clinically proven therapy should be rejected.Expert consensus, strong recommendation, strong consensus Background Since alternative therapies are intended to replace a clinically proven therapy, these are to be rejected, due to the lack ofevidence to support an equipotential effect (thus, phytotherapeu-tics and other immunomodulatory substances with confirmedequipotency to a standard therapy are not alternative therapies(see below)). Complementary therapies, which are appliedadjunctively to standard therapies, s hould be carried out in coop- eration with the treating physicians and can reinforce the stand- ard therapy. The wide public interest in alternative and comple-mentary approaches justifies the additional evaluation of thesemethods, which include: traditional Chinese medicine (TCM)including acupuncture, anthroposophic medicine, aromatherapy,Ayurveda, homeopathy, \"immunomodulative \"therapies, manual therapies (osteopathy, massage, etc.), mind/body techniques, nu-tritional supplements, naturopathy/herbalism, Qi Gong, and reiki. RECOMMENDATION 6.2.2 Naturopathic and complemen tary methods should be asses- sed according to the criteria of evidence-based medicine.Expert consensus, strong recommendation, strong consensus Background According to the CONSORT Consensus, the evaluation of an evi- dence-based medicine (EBM)- hierarchisation is determined by themethod and the question posed. This should be considered whenevaluating the literature on complementary medicine. Severalcomplementary therapies (so-called complex individual therapeu-tic interventions) depend on the salutogenic potential of thepatient and require a non-blinded p hysician-patient relationship, since corrective interactions are impossible if doctor and patient are blinded. Salutogenic therapies are usually characterised bylearning and regulative processes analogue to those which takeplace between teacher and pupil, which are dialogic in nature. The 215 Kucharzik T et al. Updated S3-Guideline Ulcerative ...Z Gastroenterol 2019; 57: 162 -241 This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. randomised controlled trial (RCT) study design is therefore not always practicable. This must be borne in mind when hierarchisingevidence-based medicine. Moreover, complementary and alterna-tive therapies are usually complex techniques which cannot be sub-stantiated by proof of the effect of any one factor, but require systematic data collection. In this case, outcome studies comparing cohorts are the appropriate method of evaluation and for the mostpart, their results are on a par with those of an RCT. RECOMMENDATION 6.2.3 Patients should be questioned regarding the use of complemen- tary therapies. Treating physicians should discuss with themtheir reasons for adopting complementary treatment methods. Expert consensus, strong recommendation, strong consensus Background Numerous studies have reported that at least half (31 % to 68 %) of patients with IBD use complementary therapeutic tech- niques [746 -752]. In children with IBD, the use of CAM is no less frequent than in adults. For the German population, a representative study indicated a 52.9 % rate of uptake among patients with IBD [752]. In IBDpatients, the most commonly use d complementary methods are homeopathy, phytotherapy, traditional Chinese medicine includingacupuncture, diet therapies, vitamins and nutritional supplements.Predictors for the adoption of complementary methods are a high- er degree of education, a whole-food diet and a total cumulative oral corticoid intake of more than 10 mg. A higher body mass index(BMI) was negatively associated with the use of CAM. Three in four patients indicated having had experience of more than one complementary technique. Only 25 % of patients feltthat they had been adequately informed about complementarytechniques. Up to 80 % expressed interest in the use of comple-mentary therapies in future. Thirty-70 % of patients did not inform their treating physician that they were using complementary methods. Physicians who administerconventional therapies underestimate both the use of complemen-tary therapies and the frequency with which this use is not disclosedby the patient. In the studies, reasons given for the use of comple-mentary medicinal techniques include seeking the optimal therapy,the desire to do without steroids, side-effects of conventional ther-apies, the desire to strengthen personal activity and individual responsibility, the holistic therapeutic approach, dissatisfaction with conventional therapies and (relative) therapy failure. In children withCrohn 's disease, the use of CAM correlated to the increase in time ab- sent from school, use of internet and more severe course of disease. RECOMMENDATION 6.2.4 Due to the high proportion of patients using complementary techniques, physicians should keep informed about thesetherapies.Expert consensus, recommendation, consensusBackground One of the reasons for patients using CAM is dissatisfaction with conventional therapies (see above). Many feel their complexmultidimensional personality to be inadequately addressed bynatural science-orientated con ventional medicine. The views of the physician and the patient are often very different, not only in terms of understanding and dealing with the disease, but also asregards self-image and outlook on life in general. Thus, consulta-tion and assistance from CAM therapists is sought from sourcesoutside the standard healthcare services, e. g., alternative practi-tioners. Not infrequently, patients pursue a two-pronged strategy,seeking additional therapeutic options while being treated withconventional therapies by a consultant practitioner. Whereas the latter is not informed that parallel CAM therapies are being used, the CAM therapist lacks expertise in ulcerative colitis. Fifteen-50 %of patients with IBD fail to infor m their treating physician that they are using complementary therapies for fear of derogatoryremarks on the part of the physician. On the other hand, lessthan 20 % of IBD consultants question their patients regardingthe use of CAM. In order to minimise risks, the arbitrary paralleluse of CAM and conventional therapies by the patient should be avoided and therapies should be closely coordinated. Such coordi- nation, and the avoidance of patient-instigated two-prongedtreatment strategies, can only succeed if the primary physicianhas adequate knowledge of the complementary therapy and canoffer competent and objective in-depth advice regarding CAMtechniques. Ideally, an integrative approach should be sought, inwhich conventional and complementary therapies merge into a\"best practice \"(WHO definition of integrative medicine). Mind-body techniques RECOMMENDATION 6.2.5 Attention-based techniques for stress reduction can be ap- plied complementarily as a means of improving quality of life.Evidence grade 2, recommendation grade 0, consensus Background A systematic review of studies on complementary and alterna- tive IBD therapies [753] identifi ed an follow-up period [754, 755]. In aprospective, randomised controlled trial in patients with remis-sion or mild disease activity using the waiting-list design,10-week lifestyle modification programmes (activity, nutrition programme, self-help strategies, stress management) improved IBDQ scores by a mean of 20 points in the intervention group (an individual improvement of 16 points is considered clinically signif-icant). The SF-36 mental health subscore showed a significantimprovement in comparison to the waiting list control group. Inthe catamnesis after 12 months, a significant difference was nolonger detectable between the groups. A systematic review of complementary and alternative meth- ods for the treatment of IBD identified two RCTs evaluating the effect of \"mindfulness \"-based therapy in patients with ulcerative colitis [756, 757]. One of these studies included 66 patients with 216 Kucharzik T et al. Updated S3-Guideline Ulcerative ...Z Gastroenterol 2019; 57: 162 -241Leitlinie This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. ulcerative colitis or Crohn 's disease in remission and compared multi-convergent therapy (mindfulness meditation with aspectsof cognitive behavioural therapy) in combination with standardtherapy with standard therapy alone [756]. A further study inclu-ded 55 patients with ulcerative colitis in remission and compared mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) with a \"time/atten- tion\"control group [757]. Neither disease activity nor psychologi- cal variables were found to be significantly different after theinterventions. An effect on quality of life was found only inpatients with irritable bowel syndrome, while patients who suffered a disease flare during the study period showed reducedlevels of CRP and stress. Evidence of effectiveness is available not only for mindfulness, but also for certain other mind-body techniques. A systematic review of complementary and alte rnative treatment methods in IBD [753] identified an RCT the effect of relaxationtraining [758]. Fifty-six patients were randomised to receiverelaxation training or standard treatment. Significant improve-ments were recorded for levels of pain, anxiety, mood, stress andquality of life in the relaxation group, but not in the standardtreatment group. The positive effects on pain are backed up by another study which assessed the effect of a relaxation technique on 40 patients with ulcerative colitis and chronic pain [759].However, the quality of this study is hard to assess, and thereforethe results should be interpreted with caution. In an RCT, the effects of a programme of breathing, movement and meditation (Breath-Body-Mind Workshop, BBMW) on physiol-ogical and psychological symptoms in 29 patients with IBD wereevaluated and compared with an education group [760]. The study concluded that BBMW can be carried out, since it leads to positive pre- and post-effects. However, an educational seminar achievessimilar results. Furthermore, the study methods are questionableand only 9 patients with ulcerative colitis were included. Again,therefore, the results should b e interpreted with caution. Physical activity could have a positive effect on ulcerative colitis, but evidence is sparse. In a prospective RCT, the effect ofactivity on IBD was evaluated. The 30 participating patients were either in remission or had mild disease activity [761]. After mod- erate jogging three times a week for ten weeks, there was a signif-icant difference between the groups in terms of social wellbeing.No other inter-group differences were found. This result shouldbe interpreted with caution, since it was a pilot study which didnot differentiate between patients with ulcerative colitis andpatients with Crohn 's disease, had a small patient collective and employed questionable methods. There were no undesired side-effects. A systematic review concludes that physical activity has a positive effect, but import antly, the analysis includes no RCTs [762]. RECOMMENDATION 6.2.6 Yoga can be used as a complementary technique to improve quality of life.Evidence grade 2, recommendation grade 0, consensusBackground A randomised, controlled pilot study evaluated the effect of yoga in comparison to standard therapy in 60 patients withulcerative colitis in remission [763]. At follow-up after 2 months,a significant difference was found with regard to anxiety and colicky abdominal pain in favour of the yoga group. A further randomised, controlled study included 77 patients with ulcerativecolitis in remission and a diminished quality of life. Yoga was foundto have a positive effect on quality of life at weeks 12 and 24, andadditionally on disease activity at week 24 [ 764]. Holistic therapies RECOMMENDATION 6.2.7 Acupuncture can be applied as a complementary therapy in patients with mild to moderate disease flares.Evidence grade 3, recommendation grade 0, consensus Background Two systematic reviews of CAM techniques and acupuncture in the treatment of patients with IBD identified an RCT which had compared acupuncture and moxibustion (10 treatment sessions in 5 weeks) to superficial needling at non-acupuncture points inpatients with mild to moderately active ulcerative colitis [753,765]. The CAI fell significantly as a result of acupuncture therapy in comparison to the control group. For the secondary endpoints,improvement in quality of life and improvement in general condi-tion, no intergroup difference was found at therapy completion[766]. Two meta-analyses which included studies from China conclu- ded that the methodological quality of the available studies is notgood enough to allow conclusions to be drawn [767, 768]. Herbal therapies RECOMMENDATION 6.2.8 Plantago ovata can be used as a complementary approach in maintenance therapy. Evidence grade 2, recommendation grade 0, consensus Background One hundred and two patients with ulcerative colitis in remis- sion were allocated into 3 groups and received either plantagoovata, plantago ovata in combination with mesalazine, or mesala-zine alone. After 12 months, no difference was found between the groups, except that stool concentrations of butyrate were better in the stool of patients who had received plantago ovata. Therewere no serious adverse events [769]. In Germany, medicationscontaining plantago ovata have been approved. 217 Kucharzik T et al.

STATEMENT 6.2.9 Studies have shown positive results for the application of curcumin complementary to mesalazine in both the inductionand maintenance of remission. Curcumin is not available as amedication in Germany.Evidence grade 2, recommendation grade 0, majority approval Background A systematic review of CAM therapies in the treatment of IBD identified two RCTs evaluating the effects of curcumin in patients with ulcerative colitis. In a prospective, randomised, double-blind,p l a c e b o - c o n t r o l l e d m u l t i c e n t r e s t u d y , 2\u00d71g / d c u r c u m i n c o m p l e -mentary to sulphasalazine or mesalazine was evaluated for remis-sion maintenance in ulcerative colitis over a period of 6 months(22 patients in the verum group) [770]. After therapy, a significantintergroup difference was observed with regard to relapse frequen-cy, CAI and endoscopic index in favour of the verum group. These positive findings are supported by those of two further high-quality RCTs [771, 772]: curcumin was found to be the superior therapy inulcerative colitis. In one of the studies, however, these effects wereseen only in the per-protocol and not in the intention-to-treat anal-ysis [771]. No difference was detected concerning side-effects. InGermany, curcumin is sold only as a nutritional supplement and isnot available as a medication. RECOMMENDATION 6.2.10 A combination of myrrh, camomile blossom extract and coffeae carbo can be given as complementary treatment inmaintenance therapy.Evidence grade 2, Recommendation grade 0, Consensus Background A systematic review of CAM therapies for IBD identified a high- quality clinical study examining the effectiveness and safety ofmyrrh, camomile blossom extract and coffeae carbo (Myrrhinilintest \u00ae) in maintenance therapy in a collective of 96 pa- tients with UC [773]. Results of the study suggested the myrrh,camomile blossom extract and coffeae carbo therapy to be verywell tolerated and no less effective than a standard mesalazine therapy in remission maintenance therapy. A follow-up question- naire-based survey and a large cohort study corroborated thesefindings [774, 775]. In Germany, there is an approved traditional medication containing the combination of myrrh, camomile blossom extractand coffeae carbo. RECOMMENDATION 6.2.11 Other unconventional remedies cannot be recommended due to insufficient data.Expert consensus, recommendation open, consensusBackground The effect of pomegranate (punica granatum peel) extract in combination with standard therapy in comparison to placebowith standard therapy was evaluated in 78 patients with moder- ately active ulcerative colitis. The study concluded that pomegra- nate extract can be administered, as it had positive effects ondisease activity and certain symptoms. However, these effectswere not superior to placebo. Side-effects were mild to moderateand did not differ between the groups [776]. A systematic review [753] identified two non-randomised studies which compared the effectiveness of Boswellia serrata(Indian frankincense) with that of sulphasalazine. Positive effects with respect to histology and stool parameters were detected in both groups, without significant intergroup differences. Side-effects included indigestion, nausea, loss of appetite and upperabdominal pain [777, 778]. Boswellia serrata is marketed inGermany only as a nutrition supplement and is not available as amedication. A systematic review [753] identified two RCTs of high quality that evaluated the effects of HMPL-004, the main ingredient of which is Andrographis paniculata (an Ayurveda plant also known as kalmegh or kalmegha) in a total of 344 patients with ulcerativecolitis. In one of these studies, the patients were treated for eightweeks with either HMPL-004 or mesalazine [779]. While bothpreparations had a positive effect on disease activity, there weremore side-effects in the mesalazine group. In the second study,two doses of HMPL-004 in combination with mesalazine(1200 mg and 1800 mg) or placebo in combination with mesala- zine were given for a period of eight weeks and compared with one another [780]. After eight weeks, the higher dose of HMPL-004 was found to be superior to placebo in terms of clinicalresponse to therapy and mucosal healing, but not in terms ofclinical remission. HMPL-004 is not available as a medication inGermany. An RCT testing the effect of wheat grass juice compared to placebo juice in 24 patients with ulcerative colitis showed that after four weeks, the patients i n the experimental group had a significant reduction in diseas e activity, rectal bleeding and abdominal pain [781]. No serious side-effects occurred. A systematic review of CAM therapies in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease [753] identified an RCT that studiedthe effect of evening primrose oil in 43 patients with ulcerative co-litis in comparison to olive oil and omega 3 oil [782]. Eveningprimrose showed superiority only in terms of stool consistency. Adverse effects were not documented. In a prospective, randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled study, 100 ml aloe vera gel was tested over a period of 4 weeks( 3 0p a t i e n t sw i t hv e r u m :1 4p a t i e n t sw i t hp l a c e b o )i np a t i e n t swith mild to moderate ulcerative colitis [783]. Due to statisticalflaws, a therapy recommendation cannot be given on the basis ofthe study 'sr e s u l t s . An RCT evaluated the effect of silymarin (milk thistle extract) compared with placebo in 80 patients [784]. No significant inter- group differences were observed. A further RCT compared the effectiveness of sophora (extract of the Japanese pagoda tree in capsule form) to that of mesalazinein 126 patients with UC [785]. The findings suggest that the treat- 218 Kucharzik T et al. Updated S3-Guideline Ulcerative ...Z Gastroenterol 2019; 57: 162 -241Leitlinie This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. ment with sophora may not be inferior to the standard therapy with mesalazine. There were no relevant side-effects. An open pilot study showed that an oral bilberry preparation consisting of dried fruits and juice concentrate may have apositive effect on disease activity [786]. However, well-designed RCTs are necessary in order to verify these results. T wo randomised, placebo-controlled clinical studies including 141 patients with ulcerative colitis show that transdermal nicotinehas additional positive effects when combined with standard ther-apy in patients with ulcerative colitis [787, 788]. On the other hand,it appears to be ineffective in remission maintenance and as amonotherapy in active colitis [789, 790]. However, the administra-tion of transdermal nicotine, especially to lifelong non-smokers, frequently causes side-effects, some of which are severe. A randomised, controlled pil ot study compared an oxygen therapy plus standard medication to standard therapy alone inpatients with active ulcerative colitis [791]. While the oxygen therapy showed no significant effects, significance could nothave been shown in any case due to the inadequate sample size. A review included an RCT studying trichuris-suis eggs in ulcera- prospective, trial, a therapy with 2500 tri- churis-suis eggs every 2 weeks over 12 weeks was evaluated in pa-tients with active ulcerative colitis (CAI > 4) [793]. At the end ofthe therapy, there was a significant intergroup difference in CAIscores in favour of the verum group. No serious side-effects wereevident. The preparation is not approved for medicinal purposesin Germany. Since a large, randomised-controlled study of its effi-cacy for remission induction in Crohn 's disease failed to show a positive effect [794], this ther apeutic approach is currently no longer being pursued. It is not possible to issue a recommenda-tion for therapy with trichuris-suis ovata (TSO).
