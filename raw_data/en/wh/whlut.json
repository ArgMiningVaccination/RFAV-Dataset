The C.I.C. also has made arrangements with one of the hospitals, where the students will be admitted for the purpose of actual observation and demonstration. METHOD OF INSTRUCTION THE C.I.C. TEACHES THE PALMER METHOD OF ADJUSTING -\"DISEASE THE CAUSE OF GERMS, NOT GERMS THE CAUSE OF DISEASE\" (p. 5):It is an established fact that the germ is a scavenger and feeds upon devitalized tissue, never upon health tissue; it is conceded that an individual possessing normal health is not prone to contract contagious or infectious diseases, for the reason that he possesses normal resistive power. Chiropractic philosophy teaches that this resistive power is present in those individuals whose cycle of nerve energy is not interfered with or broken. Alexander m. Ross, M.D., Fellow of the Royal Society of England, said, in speaking of germs: \"They are the result, not the cause of disease. They are scavengers; their legitimate work is to clean out the sewers of our bodies.\" -\"SCIENTIFIC OR STANDARD COURSE\" (p. 9): The Scientific Course consists of twenty-four eight consecutive months; during each course the student is required to attend a total of 2,800 class hours. The Scientific Course embraces every subject in the curriculum. Physicians and Osteopaths, by presenting the proper credentials to the Registrar, will be allowed credit in time and tuition. Credit in time will be applied on the Freshman term only. -\"POST-GRADUATE COURSE\" (p. 9): The Post-Graduate course, consisting of six months' intensive clinic and review work, is open to the graduates of schools and colleges recognized by the C.I.C. A Post-Graduate diploma is granted upon completion of the course. -\"TUITION\" (p. 9): The tuition may be paid weekly or monthly at the rate of $5.00 a week or $20.00 a month suiting the convenience of the student. A matriculatio fee is required. We do not ask you to sign any notes or pay any interest on the tuition. -\"DEGREES\" (p. 9): The C.I.C. confers two degrees: Doctor of Chiropractic (D.C.), and Philosopher of Chiropractic (Ph.D.) Doctor of Chiropractic (D.C.) This degree is conferred upon completion of the Scientific Course. Philosopher of Chiropractic (Ph.C.) A student to be eligible for the degree of Ph.C., must have to his credit an average of 90 per cent in all subjects. He is then allowed to submit a thesis on the Philosophy of Chiropractic, said thesis to contain not less than 10,000 words. The candidate for graduation must be twenty-one years of age or over. -\"CURRICULUM\" (p. 13): Class Hours Anatomy........................................

The Eastern Chiropractic Institute in New York City has found it necessary, because of an enrollment unprecedented in recent years, to take on additional space at its location, 55 West 42nd Street. Some seventy students are now attending its classes. A special feature of the expansion is a laboratory which is being equipped to provide individual laboratory work in chemistry and physiology for the students. The students are also getting instruction through visits to the American Museum of Natural History, the New York Public Library reference rooms, and other institutions. Clinic patients under the new plans, receive their adjustments privately, thus enabling the senior students to apply some of the principles taught in the course on office conduct and practice building. Two additions to the faculty have been made. Dr. George B. Brown will teach gynecology and Dr. Raymond E. Hummel, spinal analysis.

When we glance back ten years and perceive the change that has come over the press in this regard, we should have cause to rejoice. Perhaps the next decade will see us receiving an amount of news commensurate with our ideas of justice and equality.\" It seems to me that this is evidence enough to prove the value of the publicity office maintained by the national organization. Further on, in the same letter, it was stated that it was virtually impossible to utilize local chiropractors as a medium of publicity, for only a few could stand up under the pressure of investigation, and that others were really not practicing chiropractic, but devoting their time to modalities and at times the patient was not adjusted at all. Gentlemen, these things point definitely, it seems to me, to the need of a standard chiropractic course in which chiropractic is defined and the courses uniform throughout the schools of the United States. On December 3, 1937 I mailed you a letter asking your opinion as to the length a chiropractic course should be. Out of twenty-one schoolswritten, I have received replies from thirteen, the names of which are given in the first part of this letter. May I urge you to express yourself on this vital subject, also give me your opinion and suggestions concerning the enclosed definition of chiropractic. We want a definition that may be adopted by all schools, therefore, we want all schools to say just what definition they are willing to agree to. May I have the courtesy of a reply from you? Yours truly,... CHIROPRACTIC IS HEREBY DEFINED AS THE ADJUSTMENT, BY HAND, OF THE TISSUES OF THE HUMAN BODY FOR THE PURPOSE OF RELIEVING VITAL ENERGY, THEREBY RESTORING NORMAL FUNCTION AND HEALTH IN THE BODY. ****************** Chiropractic takes the position that Physiotherapy may be used as an aid in relaxing tissues incident to adjusting, but that it is no part of chiropractic or medicine. It is a system used by the public and, therefore, may be made free use of by all healing professions. 1938 (Jan): National Chiropractic Journal [7(1)] includes: -full page ad for Columbia Institute of Chiropractic, \"Founded 1919\" (p. 41), located at 261 West 71st Street, NYC; indicates \"New Term Starts February 7th\"; (Mar): National Chiropractic Journal [7(3)] includes: -full page ad for Columbia Institute of Chiropractic, \"Founded 1919\" (p. 39), located at 261 West 71st Street, NYC; includes sketch of campus building 1938 (June): National Chiropractic Journal [7(6)] includes: -full page ad for Columbia Institute of Chiropractic, \"Founded 1919\" (p. 45), located at 261 West 71st Street, NYC; notes new term begins September 12, 1938; includes: CHIROPRACTORS EVERYWHERE IF YOU ARE REALLY INTERESTED IN THE PROGRESS OF CHIROPRACTIC SCIENCE AND THE PROFESSION AT LARGE, WRITE TO THE COLUMBIA, AT ONCE, YOUR OPINION ON THE FOLLOWING: Do you think that we have enough Chiropractors in the field? What length of time should a Chiropractic student spend in Chiropractic College, 18 months, 24 months, 28 months, or 36 months?

Do you believe that a scientifically trained Chiropractor should know that starch in diabetes is out of question - that acid foods in parotitis are detrimental - that in acute nephritis no animal protein should be given - that dairy food rich in vitamin A will help Chiropractic to overcome the infection quicker? Do you believe that a Chiropractor should know everything there is to know about Bacteriology, so that he can point out its weaknesses to his opponents?

The subject was \"The Cause of Disease from Chiropractors Point of View.\" The Honorable Jules Goldstein, executive leader of the organization, commended Dr. Dean for his untiring efforts to educate the public in New York State to the Science of Chiropractic. Dr. Dean gave clinical demonstrations recently to an enthusiastic group of 200 members of the Elmira District, New York State Chiropractic Society. These methods were exclusively developed by the professors of the Columbia Chiropractic Institute - they are unique, effective and very easily mastered. Speakers of the meeting were Dr. Baker the president of Elmira, New York State Chiropractic Society, Dr. Warren president of the New York Sate Society and Mr. Brees, Editor of Endicott News, New York. 1938 (Aug): National Chiropractic Journal [7(8)] includes: -full page ad for Columbia Institute of Chiropractic, \"Founded 1919\" (p. 39), located at 261 West 71st Street, NYC; notes: Realizing that the sons and daughters of today's chiropractors are best qualified by heredity and environment to carry on our work, we shall donate 50 scholarships of $200 each to help them defray the cost of tuition.

In spite of persecution, all kinds of opposition from the \"regulars\" and in spite of the blunders committed by our own practitioners, the Science of Chiropractic is now known throughout the entire world. There is not one point on this globe that does not know of the wonderful results obtained through this science. Because of our wonderful achievements in the health field it is now generally recognized that Chiropractic is a necessity in the healing arts. We can now boast of hospitals, sanitariums and grade A. colleges - the latter are not interested in sending out hoards of graduates into the field, but in painstakingly and carefully eliminating theundesirable student in the beginning. This is as it should be, as we know that true success and happiness can only be accomplished if we are temperamentally and academically suited for this profession. Through our latest research we find that there is only a very small list of diseases that cannot be successfully treated through Chiropractic. Well I remember, a statement by a professor in one of the Western colleges that I attended, \"To be a profession in the full meaning of the word a calling must fulfill the following requirements: First of all, it must be of direct service to humanity. It should have literature worthy of a learned profession. It should have a definite sense of properties as manifested by a code of ethics. It should embrace within its fold a group of persons, that are scientifically trained and who are qualified to do research. It must demand proper educational standards, sufficient to obtain ample knowledge in the sciences upon which the practice of the profession is based.\" Now we are proud to be called Doctors of Chiropractic as we are respected in our communities and placed into the ranks of public benefactors, and here are a few proofs: Andrew J. Sordoni, Senator of Pennsylvania, states: \"Chiropractic science is of inestimable value to the people in Pennsylvania.\" Governor H. Moore of New Jersey: \"We do have many chiropractors in our State, and they must be rendering service to suffering humanity or they would not be able to continue.\" The Honorable Judge J.B. Heiserman, of Pennsylvania, goes on record that: \"Chiropractic, indeed, is of great value.\" Congressman William Barry: \"Chiropractic has helped many where no other methods could.\" I am also happy to say that our national, state, and county Chiropractic organizations are cooperating for once in educating the public at large to the value of Chiropractic; insisting that its members obtain additional information on the newest developments in our science; setting up offensive, and defensive campaigns against our common enemies.

After several sessions we organized an adoption of motion by Dr. Jacobs of the Eastern College \"that we do now organize ourselfes into the ALLIED CHIROPRACTIC EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS with the idea and purpose of preserving chiropractic in its purity for posterity and that we are reseolved to cooperate with all chiropractic organizations with similar purposes.\" It becomes my duty as Secretary to invite all chiropractic schools who are willing to promulgate chiropractic alone into the association, and as you were not represented at the time of organizing, you are hereby invited and urged to join us and help us to better serve the great cause for which we have, too much, separately strived in the past. It is my personal opinion that whenever and wherever we find a group of men or institutions committing themselves to the task which is also ours, that we may do well to lend them encouragement by our cooperation. The membership, to date, includes Carver, Cleveland, Eastern, O'Neil, Ratledge and Texas, all of whom were personally represented at the time of the organization and the Columbia Institute, N.Y., New York School, Standard School of N.Y., and the University of Chiropractic, Seattle. The issues transcend personalities and though any of us might not have the kindliest feeling toward, or interest in, some of the individuals or institutions so associated, I still believe that it is a step in the right direction and will bear fruit sufficient to compensate the effort which we may severally put into it. Personally, B.J. I would enjoy your association in the work of such an organization and I hope that you do join. May I have your reply as soon as you have had time to give the matter careful consideration. Dr. Weiser of Texas College was elected President of ACEI and Dr. Jacobs of the Eastern Vice President. With kindest regards and good wishes,I am, Yours very truly... 1940 (Mar 7): letter from TF Ratledge DC to Columbia Institute of Chiropractic at 261 W 71st St, NYC (Ratledge papers, CCCKC): Gentlemen: The undersigned was selected as Secretary of the Allied Chiropractic Educational Institutions at its organization in July of last year. The idea around which this organization came into existence was the advisability of chiropractic schools teaching exclusively chiropractic and not including instruction in opposing theories and professions. A few of the schools as you know have adopted the policy of teaching chiropractic, naturopathy, and various so-called drugless therapy practices in chiropractic schools wherein the work constituting a chiropractic education might be merely transposed into the education leading to degrees covering the other forms of practices. It seemed to us that this is a very dangerous policy and one which requires immediate and drastic efforts to discourage since it, in effect, commits the chiropractic educational institutions to the proposition that chiropractic education is not different in any particular to the education essential to other forms of practice, or, in other words that chiropractic philosophy is not different than therapeutic philosophies. We believe that to admit the similarity of chiropractic instruction and other instruction to the extent that it would be interchangeable in any of the preparatory work leading to different degrees would result in a destruction of chiropractic and the present basis for its distinctiveness as to the character of its practice and to its recognition under separate laws. It was the expressed opinion of representatives of all schools present at the time of organization that it was essential, in order to insure the perpetuation of chiropractic as a separate, complete, and distinct science and practice, to divorce chiropractic from the other so-called drugless therapies. Doubtless you have received copies of publications by the Palmer Chiropractic College and the Universal Chiropractic College concerning chiropractic education, legislation, chiropractic boards, and chiropractic examinations. May I suggest that if you have, that after careful study of both these expressions you write the authors comending, where you can, and offering constructive criticism where you feel it could profitably be offered. It is my opinion that these two institutions in the publications above mentioned indicate eligibility for membership in our organization, and in the above mentioned discussions definitely express the reasons for the formation of our organization, \"The Allied Chiropractic Educational Institutions.\" If you will be so kind as to write me your thoughts and conclusions upon these matters it would be of assistance in the formulation of our program for the coming year. I would like very much to receive from you and every other member institution of our association suggestions for a proposed definition of chiropractic to be submitted to publishers of dictionaries, encyclopedias, etc. It would seem that the educational institutions are the proper source of such a definition. Please let me have any suggestions concerning any phase of our problems which you may have in mind. Thanking you advance, I am Very truly ytours, Dr. T.F. Ratledge Secretary of the Allied Chiropractic Educational Institutions 1940 (July 10): letter to \"Dr. Frank E. Dean, Registrar,\" Columbia Institute of Chiropractic, from TF Ratledge (Ratledge papers, CCCKC): Dear Doctor Dean: Doubtless you have received a letter of July 1, 1940, from Dr. H.E. Weiser, President, Allied Chiropractic Educational Institutions calling a meeting in Kansas City on July 20, 1940. Permit me to suggest that, if for any reason you can not have a representative from your school attend the meeting on that date, youimmediately make out a proxy to Dr. Carver, Dr. Cleveland, Dr. Drain or to me and then send to me by return air mail, so that I can determine in advance whether or not we will have a quorum. For your convenience a self-addressed, stamped envelope is enclosed. This is very important and I urge that you give the matter immediate attention. Trusting that I shall see you in Kansas City on the 20th, I am, Very truly yours, T.F.

Belleview Hotel Annual meeting of Associated Chiropractic Educational Institutions ROLL CALL Present by personal representative or written proxies: Carver, Cleveland, Columbia, Eastern, New York, O'Neil-Ross, Palmer, Ratledge, Standard and Texas. Motion by Cleveland that the Palmer School of Chiropractic be admitted to membership, seconded by Carver, passed unanimously. Motion by Dr. B.J. Palmer to draft Resolution that the ACEI go on record as being opposed to the practice by chiropractors of any auxilliary that is clearly within the practice of medicine and demand that the NCA reorganize its educational institutions dept. to conform to this explanation and prohibition. And, further, that we urge, recommend and demand that the NCA, if it shall set up or establish any course as a standard of chiropractic instruction, shall set up such course by itself without intermingling chiropractic, in any way whatsoever, with other courses in any of the drugless therapies taught in educational institution members, and we go on record as being unalterably opposed to, and refuse to be bound by any standard of courses set up by any group which standard fails to provide for separate instruction in each. Further, we are unalterably opposed to the pretended lengthening of courses in chiropractic educational institutions when the increase in time is devoted to nonchiropractic courses. We further demand that the NCA shall demand of its chiropractic institution members that such instruction shall be entirely seperate in its entirety and that such institutions shall have been organized for that purpose and shall have seperate instructors for chiropractic courses and other courses, and that each course so taught shall lead to graduation and certification in each of said different courses. We wish to go on record and respectfully recommend to the NCA that chiropractic shall not be commercialized, and that it shall be held seperate and distinct for its purposes and objects. Dr. Palmer proposed that resolution include reference to the CHB and other chiropractic organizations. Dr. Willard Carver appointed to draft resolution. General discussion concerning objectives. Recessed for Noon. Afternoon convened. Committee on resolution reported. Motion by Dr. Carl Cleveland that resolution be adopted. Unanimous. Motion by Cleveland, seconded by Carver that \"each member present sign resolution for institution he personally represents and by proxy. Passed unanimously. Palmer, Cleveland, Carver and Texas each paid to Secretary $5.00 to cover incidental expenses. Moved by Dr. Willard Carver that we consider and declare this organiztion permanently organized under the name and style of the Allied Chiropractic Educational Institutions and that we defer adoption of articles of association to a later date, which date shall be fixed by a call of the president and secretary. Seconded by T.F. Ratledge. Passed unanimously.There being no further business before the meeting it was declared adjourned. T.F. Ratledge, Secretary. 1940 (July 20): Allied Chiropractic Educational Institutions (straight schools: Texas, Carver, Cleveland, Columbia, Ratledge, Eastern, Palmer) assembled at Kansas City MO, issues its ultimatum to NCA (Ratledge papers-CCCKC Archives) IN THE MATTER OF THE PRESERVATION OF CHIROPRACTIC: AN ADDRESS The Allied Chiropractic Educational Institutions in convention assembled at Kansas City, Missouri, this the 20th day of July, A.D. 1940, present this address to the National Chiropractic Ass. and to the Chiropractic Health Bureau, and each and all allied or independent organizations professedly within the Chiropractic profession. This organization of Chiropractic Educational Institutions recommends as its unswerving policy that Chiropractic in its simplicity and purity shall be protected and carried on without being encroached upon by any entangling alliances and without being placed in such relationship to any system, method or element of approach that its fundamentals, objects and aims shall be in any manner or to any extent infringed or encroached upon. As a means of carrying out the object just stated, this organization of educational institutions demands that any national organization within the Chiropractic profession that expects to carry on and expects to encourage and maintain the friendly cooperation of the educational institutions this organization represents must advocate that Chiropractic educational institutions shall teach maintain only a specific course in Chiropractic education, including such anatomic, physiologic, pathologic and symptomatologic facts as are necessary to prepare the student to definitely apply the fundamental principles of Chiropractic in his practice in a safe, constructive, and specific manner, and in this connection this organization advises that it will frown upon any profession that in any manner conflicts or attempts to conflict with the fundamental facts thus stated and laid down. This organization of educational institutions, in order to be thoroughly well understood, as to what it means by the establishment of a Chiropractic course of study, leading to the practice of Chiropractic, says and declares and wishes it understood that all branches of medicine are particularly declared to be not a part or not a possible part of a course of study in Chiropractic. The prohibited subjects, it will thus appear, are the prescription and administration of drugs, the practice of surgery by instrumental and intervention or use of instruments in any surgical effort, and this includes radionics, diathermy in any of its aspects, and all other allied machines generally classified as auxiliaries and professing any aspect of cure or relief. This also includes hydrotherapy, and all phases of naturopathy and all allied subjects thereto, which includes water cure and all so-called natural therapeutic methods. This organization of educational institutions wishes it to be particularly understood that it is in favor of courses of sufficient length to impart the information required to safely and properly practice Chiropractic, and it is particularly opposed to the present method of extending courses of study in Chiropractic educational institutions for the purpose of permitting general instruction in the use of such auxilliaries as have already been mentioned and referred to, and it wishes it understood that it is definitely opposed to such courses teaching various aspects of medical and surgical practice for which the student is not prepared in proper courses of Chiropractic study. The Allied Chiropractic Educational Institutions wish to make a separate representation of its attitude and to make a separate demand for carrying out its fixed beliefs as to the present safe course of advancement for Chiropractic. SEPARATE EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONSThis organization definitely recommends that if physiotherapy, that is to say, instruction in the use of the modalities such as were heretofore pointed out and indicated, is to be given, that in order to do so, it will be necessary to establish a separate educational institution with a faculty that is ample and competent to teach each and all of the subjects of physical or physio-therapeutic, and that there shall be a fixed course of study which, if successfully finished, will lead to a proper degree showing the character of study completed, and that if practice under such degree so issued by said separately organized and facultied institution, shall be made, that it must be done in each state and province, under law definitely passed to regulate the practice of the particular art indicated by said diploma, and that if a Board of Examiners shall be graduates of such a physical or physio- therapeutical educational institution, and not otherwise; and such institution shall never employ Chiropractors as a part of its faculty, but must employ experts in the particular subject or subjects that are to be taught and that are to form a part of the instruction of students in that character of educational institution. THE MORE SPECIFIC ULTIMATUM To the National Chiropractic Association, the Chiropractic Health Bureau, and all allied organizations purporting to be within the Chiropractic profession, the Allied Chiropractic Educational Institutions goes on record and states that unless a reorganized plan of your bodies, association, or by whatever name known, reorganized, amend and change said organizations in such way as to be in conformity with the suggestions and demands of allied educational institutions, we find it is necessary that we shall withdraw all support that has ever come from the members of this organization to your organization in every way, shape and manner, and we say to you now in all kindness and truth that unless reorganization, amendments, etc., are accomplishments by you within a reasonable time, the members of the Allied Chiropractic Educational Institutions shall feel free to organize a separate national organization that will be strictly Chiropractic in all of its departments, and will look to carrying out, all and singular, the things that have been said in this address. This matter has been fully considered and unanimously passed by this organization, which has signed the same as such and each of its members has signed in his individual capacity.

Wayne, Ind. 1940 (Aug 8): letter to Pres., (Ratledge papers, CCCKC): Dear Doctor Dean: I desire to thank you for sending your proxy to me in time for the Kansas City meeting of the Allied Chiropractic Educational Institutions last month. We had a good representation and received the Palmer School as a new member, which, in our opinion, is a big step toward complete organization and intelligent cooperation of all the schools. There are only two schools who are eligible, in that they teach chiropractic exclusively, that are not new members of the ACEIwhich was formed only last year. We feel that this is a great step forward for chiropractic. It is my opinion that the schools, as they have had to do in the past, will take the lead in every forward movement in the profession. I do not mean in the sense of dictating, but just showing the way by going ahead ourselves. If the field is anxious to appear as independent of the schools and claim responsibility for past progress in chiropractic I think that it will harm no one to let them think so, but in the meantime just keep the schools away ahead in thought and work. Dr. Palmer really proved his good faith wil all the REAL CHIROPRACTIC schools when he joined the ACEI and now it seems that there can be no reason that is sound that can keep out any genuinely chiropractic educational institution. The Universal and Lincoln are the only ones of which I know that are eligible to membership on that basis and I believe that they stayed out just to see whether or not Dr. Palmer would cooperate with other schools. Now that he has shown his willingness and good faith I believe that they can find no valid reason to remain nonmembers of the organization. Enclosed is typewritten copy of KC statement which is self explanatory and I am sure that it will meet with your complete approval. Please let me have your thoughts on the matters herein referred to. With kindest personal wishes to you and wishing your institution every success, I am, Sincerely... 1940 (Aug 9): letter to Craig M. Kightlinger DC from TF Ratledge (Ratledge papers, CCCKC): Dear Doctor Kightlinger: Enclosed is copy of statement of principles and objects of the ACEI as adopted at K.C. July 20, 1940. As you will note Dr. Cleveland exercised powers of your proxy and signed for you as he felt, and so did we all, that you would heartily approve of our action. I believe that after all the schools will, as they have had to do in the past, lead the way in chiropractic progress and I believe that the ACEI is the nucleus around which the future of the science will revolve. We missed you very much at KC and the expressed regret was concurred in by all. Those actually present were B.J., Carver, Drain, Cleveland and myself. Owing to the short notice of the date and place of meeting it was impossible for O'Neil, Dean, McCoy to attend, however, O'Neil, Dean and you sent proxies. I cannot see any logical reason now why Universal and Lincoln will not join us. B.J. surely showed a genuine desire to cooperate and I feel that they can do no less. It cannot be said that our organization has any unreasonable or illogical basis upon which it proposes to proceed. Surely no chiropractic educator or other person who has given the matter serious thought can disagree with the belief upon which the ACEI is founded that it is better to teach chiropractic as a complete science and service in the field of health than \"it is or would be to teach it as a part of some course which was a hodgepodge of conflicting ideas\". If this thought is correct, then no chiropractic institution can possibly serve chiropractic as well, or its own graduates, as if it taught them chiropractic exclusively. Please write me what occurred at the NCA meeting as no news has so far filtered through to the Pacific coast as to what they did. They are definitely on their way out unless they become champions of CHIROPRACTIC instead of drug-LESS practice and naturopathy. They are through in California. They have been on the wrong side of every issue in this State where there was a struggle between chiropractic and naturopathy. They have never done anything constructive in California, and, as far as I can see, anwhere-else except to meddle and try to assume unwarranted authority over the profession.With kinest personal regards and best wishes for the success of your institution, I am, Sincerely,... 1941 (Feb): National Chiropractic Journal [10(2)] includes: -Dr. John A.

Unanimous adoption. -see also 1939 (Nov) -draft of resolution attached to above minutes: TO THE MEMBERS OF THE CHIROPRACTIC PROFESSION IN THE VAROUS STATES AND PROVINCES: A REQUEST IN FURTHERANCE OF OUR SYSTEM OF DEFENSE AGAINST FOREIGN POWERS, ETC. It is a matter of common knowledge that through our present defense efforts whereby a very large number of young men between the ages of 21 and 35 have been taken to training camps under \"the selective draft,\" that the Chiropractic educational institutions have been made to suffer definite reductions in student bodies. In connection with this thought it must also be remembered that the main body of practicing Chiropractors of the United States are rapidly becoming old persons; which means that unless help comes by large influx of new material, there is to be a very severe reduction in our professional ranks in connection with the aging of our Chiropractors, which will be irrepreable. There has been for several years a constant tendancy for the personnel of students in our educational institutions to be composed of young persons. And lately this has been very markedly so. Formerly, many middle aged persons entered Chiropractic educational institutions as students, but lately the matriculations have been almost altogether of persons between the ages of 21 and 35 years, and lately of persons between the ages of 21 and 28. In view of this situation we urge it upon the members of the Chiropractic profession everywhere to spend time, effort and money to send properly qualified men 35 years of age and older to Chiropractic educational institutions as students, and particularly to devote a very concentrated and well regulated effort to the sending of women students to Chiropractic educational institutions. If we act now and act intelligently and energetically, much of the apparent difficulty as to the marked reduction of Chiropractors can be avoided, but we are fully persuaded that this can only be done by an aroused and energetic effort in which all members of the Chiropractic profession shall indulge freely. This resolution has been unanimously adopted by the Allied Chiropractic Educational Institutions assembled at Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, this 15th day of March, 1941, and signed by the Acting President and Secretary. 1941 (Mar): National Chiropractic Journal [10(3)] includes:-\"New York: Dr. Dean lectures to C.I.O.\" (p. 35): Though the good offices of Dr. William Weisberg, Local 338 of the C.I.O. invited Dr. Frank E.

Oringer, D.C., president of Standard School (CCE Archives #35-02- 1956): Dear Dr. Nugent: The application of the Committee on Educational Standards of the National Chiropractic Association has been discussed in its entirety by the Board of Directors of our school. There are several questions we would like answered by you or your committee. 1. What do you mean by \"Approval of schools,\" does it mean approval or disapproval or does it mean a rating such as A, B or C? 2. What does a four (4) year course comprise? Does it mean four (4) separate calendar years of nine (9) months, for example, a student matriculating Sept. 1941 at our school graduates June 1945, which means he has studied four (4) years of nine (9) months each in separate calendar years, or does it mean thirty-two (32) or thirty-six (36) consecutive months so called four (4) years of eight (8) months or four (4) years of nine (9) months but completed in three (3) years or less? We, at the Standard, are willing to cooperate with the N.C.A. Committee and are willing to mail our complete list of students, the date of matriculation, and the date of graduation provided of course that we receive assurances that all other schools cooperating with the N.C.A. do likewise. Our Board of Directors wish to have these questions answered before taking a definite position.

(blind DC), whose practice Weiant apparently took over in Peekskill NY (from CCE Archives; in my CINY file): Dear Dr. Nugent: I am happy to inform you that at a meeting which we held yesterday it was decided to set aside Sunday, March 7th, for consultation with you on school matters, provided, of course, that date happens to be a convenient one for you. Meanwhile, various members of the faculty are giving careful attention to your monograph. Let me know as soon as you can whether the date is agreeable, so that I can advise all concerned. You might also suggest the probable amount of time we shall need and the hour that we should begin our deliberations. I have not yet replied to your inquiry relative to Dr. Raskin. His position at Columbia is a very minor one. Some busy-body, I understand, took the trouble to ask the University if Raskin is a professor. The reply was in the negative and this information was transmitted to Connecticut with evident intent to discredit him, but I don't believe he ever pretended to be a professor. He has served as laboratory assistant in connection with a course in neuro-anatomy and has made some investigations which seem to require a revision of certain ideas with reference to Wallerian degeneration. I believe he would do credit to your Educational Session. Sincerely, CWWeiant1943 (Nov 30): report by John J. Nugent D.C. to \"Executive Board of Directors and Committee on Educational Standards\" (CCE Archive #35-12-1938): New York School Situation: The school problem in New York is inextricably entangled in the fight for chiropractic legislation. They cannot be separated. To solve one is to solve the other. The attitude of certain individuals in New York regarding schools is a reflection of their attitude on legislation. Therefore, my time in New York on legislative matters has been devoted as much to the school situation as to any other. If legislation is enacted recognizing chiropractic in New York, all the present schools will have to go out of business. The schools, as they are at present, could not possibly qualify for recognition by the New York Board of Regents. All schoolmen, without exception, in New York admit that. There are no schools in New York which can meet even the NCA's requirements. For the NCA to fully approve any of these schools and then have them rejected by the Regents would be calamitous and would cause reverberations in many state legislatures of the country. What a weapon to place in the hands of our opponents with which to discredit our accrediting system. The Legislative Committee and their attorneys decided that I should be the one to handle all school and educational questions before the Commission. I think you can understand what the situation would look like if you had representatives from all the schools there with conflicting opinions and so forth. In preparation for that, I spent all of last week in the New York schools making a general survey, being prepared to answer any and all questions on corporate set-up, charter provisions, financial background, faculties, students, curriculum, and so forth. In the course of this work I explored with each of the school heads, the possibilities of amalgamation and the formation of one strong school. I realized that while I was getting information for the Commission hearings, I was also obtaining very valuable information for joint discussions on amalgamation. I am happy to report that all aeed that there should -- in fact could -- be only one school under Regents' control. I proposed a joint meeting of school heads and this will take place in a week or so. To arrange details and make satisfactory arrangements for all concerned will not be easy but with patience and tact I am sure our end can be accomplished. The schools who will participate are the Eastern Institute, The Standard School, the New York School and the Columbia Institute. All of the men involved, with the exception of one school head, feel that the NCA is doing a splendid job in New York and the most enthusiastic and eager are those who have less reason, since they are head schools which we have not mentioned in any classification of approval. It was most fortunate that I had explored the possibility and had formulated plans in my mind for amalgamation because that very question was raised by the Commission and was the source of lengthy discussion. I was asked if I was going to approach the Regents on the subject. I told them of my efforts and that it was my purpose as seen as a working agreement could be reached among the schools, to solicit the help of the Regents in melding the school to their desires. This made a great impression upon the Commission and there was much nodding of heads in approbation. I was later informed by the attorneys representing the Speakers of the House and Senate, who are observers at the hearings, that I could be sure of considerable help from influential sources. This is the indicated thing to do and if we are successful, we will have cleaned up chiropractic education in the Eastern Seaboard of this country. Further to this subject, I wish I were at liberty at this time to report to you of similar negotiations in another section of the country. Important discussions will take place early in December. For the time being, I am not free to speak. However, I wish to assure you that the school situation is not so black as the few protests we have heard would indicate.Eastern Institute of Chiropractic: The flurry caused by Dr. Kightlinger's letters is not going to cause us to deviate from the settled policy laid down over the past hard fought years. Perhaps, in the interest of clarity of thinking, I should take up in detail the points set forth in the letter of the faculty of the Eastern Institute dated November 9, addressed to Dr. Rogers as Secretary of the NCA. It is the first clear statement of the school in all of the correspondence so far. The letter makes three points. I will take them one by one: (1)\"We should have been presented with a bill of particulars concerning our deficiencies before any public action was taken in order that we might determine to what extent we should comply with prescribed conditions.\" Since October, 1938, when Dr. Crider and I held a conference with Dr. Kightlinger, the course at the Eastern has not changed. In fact, I can go further back to an inspection I made in 1936, and to volumes of correspondence and to notes of many conferences during the years 1938 to 1943. It is still as of this date, a thirty months course with 2311 sixty minute hours. It is still the same course as it was when Dr. Kightlinger put up his famous fight before the House of Delegates at Toronto. No one better than Dr. Kightlinger and his faculty know that the basic requirement for approval is a thirty-six months course of not less than 2600 hours. If that does not exist, everything else follows. \"One does not have to eat the whole sheep to know that the sheep is tainted.\" I think that is a complete answer to his first point. In his second point he states: (2)\"Schools which have declined to cooperate in any way or, which are outside the NCA, have not been penalized by having the fact published that they are not approved.\" Of course, we haven't published the list of schools not cooperating We dare not or we would be in legal difficulties. They did not ask for our rating and we, therefore, have no authority to rate them -- which we would be doing if we mentioned them in any connection with a list of schools approved. No other accrediting system mentions schools which are not approved. They simply do not appear on an approved list. Their very absence from the list is significant enough. However, schools previously approved or on probation do appear on all lists. In any event, this point made by the Eastern is not an argument why Eastern School should be approved. The third point: (3)\"There has been no disposition on the part of the NCA to strengthen schools financially in some way so that they might attain the desired standard, as, for example, by the creation of scholarships, publicity campaigns for students, endowments, etc. This is not an argument against the rating which Eastern was given. It's a continuation of the arguments which Dr. Kightlinger has made at many Conventions in the past against raising standards. It's an argument against the whole idea of rating any chiropractic school. We cannot approve schools just simply because we personally like the individuals who head them. Our personal feelings toward individuals are not the criteria by which we can judge schools. It frequently makes it painful for us when warm friendships are involved but if our integrity means anything -- and it means everything in this school program -- we must hew to the line and let the chips fall where they may. I am sure that the notion of Dr. Kightlinger was only due to his natural impetuousness. I do not believe that he intends to take advantage of his position as head of the School Council to foster dissention and rebellion among the malcontents. I know he does not want to be aligned with those forces who have consistently fought high standards or to give them comfort or assistance. I am quite sure that he intends to give more than lip service to our effort for higher standards. I am sure of all these things because I have had several heart to heart talks with him, the latest being only a week ago. For the second time this year I sat down with Dr. Kightlinger and his entire faculty and explained fully and without equivocation whatthe Committee on Educational Standards expected of his school. The first occasion was on March 7, 1943 and the last session was on October 12, just before I left for Tampa. I produced facts and figures and finally Dr. Kightlinger asked me if I would devote a week or two to the school and get them straightened out. To this I agreed, and finally a week ago he expressed some warm sentiments of friendship and approval for what we are trying to do. So I feel confident the whole New York School situation can be cleared up in the course of a few months. 1943-44: Ernest G. Napolitano serves \"on the B.J. Palmer Research Clinic staff through 1944\" (Columbia, 1969) 1944 (June 20): letter to TF Ratledge from Frank E. Dean DC of Columbia Institute of Chiropractic at 261 W. 71st St. in NYC (Ratledge papers, CCCKC Archives): My dear Dr. Ratledge, Although I have never had the pleasure of meeting you personally, I have a feeling of know you nevertheless, as I have heard so much good about you and your college. Incidentally, as you may recall, we sent you some students who were transferred to California. About two years ago, one of our instructors, Dr. Francis I. Regardie, enlisted in the armed forces. Because of his health, and other conditions, he was recently discharged, and he is desirous of going to California, where he holds a license to practice. He is now 37 yuears of age, in the prime of life, an excellent speaker and writer, and formerly an instructor in anatomy in our school. If you can use his services in any way, please write me at your earliest convenience so that he will not have to make a contact with any other school. With best personal wishes, I remain, Sincerely yours,... FED/fir 1944 (June 24): letter from TF Ratledge to Frank E. Dean DC of Columbia Institute of Chiropractic at 261 W. 71st St. in NYC (Ratledge papers, CCCKC Archives): Dear Doctor Dean: Yours of June 20th. at hand and glad to hear from you. Also, thank you for the kindliness expressed in your letter. I recall something about some students who were formerly in your institution either enrolling here or at least talking about it, however, I do not remember details about them. I recall that a Mr. Richards from some school in N.Y. did start in to finish his course but when the war came on he discontinued the work. I believe that he was a native of Germany and perhaps had not completed citizenship in the U.S.A. At present I have no opening for additional instructor but, if Dr. Regardie does come out, have him get in touch with me and it might be that things would have changed by that time. Nothing is very certain these hectic days. I trust that your institution does not commit itself to the \"Baruch\" scheme to steal chiropractic by a failing medical click or in support of the bill now in congress which would place chiropractors in a service situation where they would be subject to medical control through the surgeon general's office. Either proposal is dangeraous and it is unfortunate that anyone, posing as representing the profession, should betray chiropractic by attempting to commit chiropractic to medicine or as any part of it. If Dr. Regardie ever expects to establish a practice there is no better opportunity than now in California. All the chiropractors are doing well, making money as they never did before. The only thing is, many of them are so anxious to make money that they sort of conduct a \"drugless department store\" office and let the patient decide what he needs instead of the Doctor making such decision and more and more people complain that they cannot get an adjustment any more. \"The chiropractors do everything else but give an adjustment\". I cannot understand why so many chiropractors have so little imagination that they cannot determine that the proper practice ofchiropractic requires doing all of the things necessary in the complete application of the chiropractic principles which are universally applicable in human health problems. With every good wish, I am, Very truly yours, PHOTOGRAPH From the back of Columbia Institute's 1945 catalog 1945: brochure for CIC (from Ed Kimmel DC, who was student of CIC in 1946); lists staff (p. 3): Administrative Staff H.

The Faculty of Columbia Institute of Chiropractic consists of preeminently qualified instructors, each being a master and experienced practitioner of the subject he teaches. The instructor, realizing that which lies beyond his pupil's immediate goal, reaches out with him into the future - alert, and ever ready to assist in opening the possibilities lying dormant within the individual - until that student acquires his highest knowledge and skill. ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS - Two years of college credits are prerequisite to an admission. However, C.I.C. will consider a few applicants each year with a High School diploma, who show exceptional ability. Moral turpitude, or addiction to drugs or alcohol, renders the applicant ineligible for admission. REGISTRATION - Application for enrollment should be made with the Registrar in the administration office at 261 West 71st Street any day or evening between the hours of 10 A.M. and 8 P.M. Saturdays by appointment only. NEW CLASSES - are formed in January, April and September. COURSE OF INSTRUCTION - Consists of four years, ten months to the year, which must be taken in four consecutive calendar years. The total number of 6,020 class hours are offered. Each class hour has a duration of sixty minutes. (The evening class require 4,000 hours of attendance.) FOREIGN STUDENTS - The United States Government exempts from the Immigration quota regulations all students enrolled with the Columbia Institute of Chiropractic. TECHNIQUE - Palmer and Columbia Technique. The Science and Art of Chiropractic has made remarkable progress in the last fifty years. There is abundant opportunity for interesting and original work in its diverse fields for persons with proper training. The Columbia Institute of Chiropractic has kept stride with this progress by introducing a number of modern methods, one of which is the Columbia Technique, a unique method of adjusting, evolved after twenty-seven years of painstaking observation, analysis, and deduction, which proved to be sound in practice. We are unbiased, as we include in our curriculum also, any method that has proved to be of unquestionable value. The students are also trained in a knowledge of prophylactic procedures, which in our opinion should be stressed as an important factor in the education of a Chiropractor.VISUAL EDUCATION - As far as we know, C.I.C. is the first chiropractic educational institution in this country to introduce this modern method of instruction. AIDS IN SECURING EMPLOYMENT - We are always glad to assist students in finding employment while studying with us. We maintain reasonable facilities for handling the employment situation. X-RAY - The X-Ray Laboratory, located in another building is equipped with the latest apparatus, which includes a 36 inch Bucky- diaphragm for upright and horizontal positions. The student is instructed in applied X-Ray Physics, Spinography, Radiography of osseous and soft tissue, and a Transilluminating apparatus is at hand for the use of the student. PRACTICAL TRAINING - Instruction in the practical application of the Science and Art of Chiropractic IS THE FOUNDATION OF OUR COURSE. Therefore, our students are grouped in small classes in order to provide the utmost individual attention from the teaching staff. REFRESHER COURSE - Taking cognizance of the fact, that many of the Doctors of Chiropractic who were discharged from the armed forces of our country need a review course in the subjects vital to their practice, we will arrange a special course to fit their requirements. STUDENT PUBLICATION - The \"Columbian\" established in 1931 is one of the outstanding student publications in the country. Its average circulation is over 2,500. On special occasions, over 5,000 copies of the \"Columbian\" have been distributed throughout various parts of the U.S.A. and Canada. STUDENT ACTIVITIES - ALPHA CHI OMEGA fraternity is open to the undergraduates for the promotio of good fellowship. Alumni Association - one of the most aggressive and constructive organizations of its kind. Gymnasium - a welll equipped gym is availab for use of Splanchnology Osteology Myology Genesiology Angiology Embryology Syndesmology Chiropractic Technique Physiology Pathology Physical Diagnosis Neurology Chemistry Analytical Laboratory Hygiene and Sanitation SymptomatologyChiropractic Bacteriology Radiography Obstetrics, Pediatrics Dietetics Orthopedy Palpation Chiropractic Gynecology Chiropractic and General First Aid Philosophy and Chiropractic Jurisprudence Glossary Nerve Tracing Psychology Chiropractic Office Routine Standard text books are used in all the above subjects. A complete reference library is at the disposal of the student. TUITION AND FEES Matriculation fee (Payable upon registration)$50.00 Laboratory Fee (Payable each year) 5.00 Tuition (Payable each month for 40 months)30.00 Students, who because of absence, except for illness, are required to make up class work, will be charged the regular tuition rate of $30.00 per month. We reserve the right to change the hours and the faculty without notice. 1945 (Mar 22): letter from TF Ratledge to James R. Drain DC of Texas Chiropractic College (Ratledge papers, CCCKC Archives) Dear Doctor Drain:I recently wired to your organization for a telegraphic statement in opposition to State Examining Boards having authority to approve or disprove Chiropractic Colleges. I wanted the statement to present to a committee of the Legislature at a hearing to have been held on last Tuesday. The matter was postponed however, and since I did not receive a statement from you by telegram I am now requesting that you send me a letter stating your position in this matter. I received statements objecting to such powers being given to Examining Boards from Carver, Cleveland, Palmer and Columbia. I need your statement to make it unanimous. Urging that you send me this at your earliest opportunity, I am, with best wishes, Yours very truly, 1945 (June 11): Napolitano marries Helen Iddings (Dzaman et al., 1980, p. 180) 1945 (Aug 3): Frank E.

Dean, Dean of Columbia Institute of Chiropractic, from TF Ratledge (Ratledge papers, CCCKC Archives) Dr. Frank E. Dean, Registrar Columbia Institute of Chiropractic 261 W. 71st Street New York, N.Y. Dear Doctor Dean: Your letter of November 19th received and read with much interest. Also with appreciation for your offer of $100.00 toward the legal expenses against the California Board. For your information will state that the Board has no right to change the law by wish expressed in rules or otherwise. I note with special interest your reference to the effect of Selective Service upon your enrollment and am sorry to know that it has interfered so seriously. Selective Service resulted in a similar situation with us until about the last year, during which time our enrollments have increased very decidedly until at the present time we are nearing a point where it will be necessary to increase our facilities. If I were you, I would give very serious consideration to the possibility that the 4000 hour requirements may have a very important influence in your lessened enrollment. It stands to reason that a prospective chiropractic student having been reared in medical environment as they all have and not understanding fully the scientific import of chiropractic education would feel that if they were to take up a profession that required 4000 hours, and since the study of medicine only requires 400 hours, they would prefer to study medicine instead of chiropractic. It is my sincere belief that chiropractic is not only standing in its own light, but is imposing upon chiropractic students, and most of all depriving the people who need chiropractic services of the health they might otherwise have in its childish attempt to copy after medicine in hour requirements for completion of a course in chiropractic. Again thanking you for your interest in our problem and trusting that the contemplated action against the California Board will benefit chiropractic in New York by setting important precedents, and with best wishes for your success, I am, Yours very truly,... TFR:LD 1946 (Jan 3): letter from TF Ratledge to Vinton F. Logan, D.C. in St. Louis (Ratledge papers, CCCKC Archives):Dear Doctor Vinton: Have just read your article \"Our Major Practice, Chiropractic\" in January Basic Technician and hasten to express my approval of a most splendid and timely article. For the life of me I cannot understand why the chiropractor should spend his money advertising his competitor but too many do it. At this moment a rocket plane is being catapulted over with a swish and before I could write three words it was gone. I cannot avoid the comparison between the SCIENCE of chiropractic and the practices based upon therapeutic superstitions. Yet, there are minds in our profession that would, figuratively, require than an ox wagon and team of oxen be attached to that plane to make the people believe that it is an \"improve method of ox transportation. It seems that truth is feared and can only be tolerated slowly or in homeopathic doses, therefore, in order NOT to shock the minds (weak or otherwise) of the people in general, and the chiropractors in particular, it is necessary that the people not be permitted to realize that there is as much difference in chiropractic and therapeutic practices as there is between an ox cart and a rocket plane. The practice of chiropractic is the application of its principles. Stated in other words, it is the doing of any or all of things necessary to apply the chiropractic principles. Chiropractic is a particular concept of human body manifestations under varying conditions of living. Chiropractic is that concept which glorifies the human body, attributing to it All of the powers essential to its own maintenance instead of, as does the therapeutic concepts, playing down the importance of the body powers and playing UP the power of disease entities. Certainly, any act indicated by reasoning upon that premise is proper procedure in applying the chiropractic principles. Or, in other words, any act resulting from a conclusion reached upon or consistent with, the chiropractic concept IS the practice of chiropractic. I have discussed this approach to the problem of uniting the profession with the late Willard Carver, B.J. Palmer and with some of the leaders of the other, or \"Left Wing\" chiropractors and all, without exception, agree that the \"PRACTICE OF CHIROPRACTIC IS CONSTITUTED IN THE APPLICATION OF ITS PRINCIPES.\" I believe that you will also agree that the above is correct and that if the profession could be brought to a realization of the simplicity of the formula, leaving every man to his own ideas in applying the principles, attempting no coercion, letting him evaluate his own acts, and devoting the time efforts and money of the profession to the encouragement of study, research and scientific comparison of findings of all, we WOULD have unity on the main issues. Would be pleased to have your reactions to the above. With every good wish for 1946, I am, Yours very truly,... 1946 (Jan 9): letter from TF Ratledge to Paul O. Parr DC of the Carver Chiropractic College at 521 North West 9th Street, Oklahoma City (Ratledge papers, CCC/KC Archives): Dear Doctor Parr: Some time ago I wrote to Mrs. Willard Carver concerning school policies in connection with the arbitrary position taken by the California State Board of Chiropractic Examiners and she advises me that I should take the matter up with you. The State Board is attempting to raise the requirements in California by its rule rather than by amendment of the law, and are thereby creating a condition of great confusion in relation to applicants seeking license in the State of California. It is our present plan to bring suit in appropriate court to settle this issue, and I would like the moral support of all of the institutions who are members of the Allied Chiropractic Educational Institutions. Have heard from the Texas College which gives me its moral support and from Columbia College in New York which gives its moral support and some financial assistance in the matter of expense. So far have not heard from Cleveland or Kansas City. The Palmer School ofChiropractic is giving us its moral support and suggests that it will assist financially up to $1,000. It appears that the expense of the situation will run from $5,000 to $7,000. At the present time, considering the thousand dollars so far donated by this institution and $1,000 by the P.S.C. and practitioners in the field plus a student body fund at this institution, we have approximately $3,500.00 pledged to date. The Board arbitrarily refuses to admit Chiropractors having the educational requirements of the Act which are 2,400 hours in certain subjects completed in not less than 18 months. Up to this time there has never been any thought of the law requiring more than the stated above and there has been no hesitancy on the part of previous boards in admitting individuals so qualified to examination. This Board is demanding 4,000 hours as a minimum upon which an applicant may be admitted to examination for license to practice in California. I shall very much appreciate your moral support and in case the college would desire any financial assistance it would of course be of great help and much appreciated. I am sure that you will agree with me that the frantic efforts here and there in the Chiropractic profession to emulate the practice of medicine in college, years, subjects and hours as well as the acceptance of medical theories is a serious mistake and will act chiefly to retard the progress of chiropractic by deterring prospective students from taking up chiropractic. This will have the effect of limiting chiropractic service to the people, and you and I know that it is greatly needed by many to whom it is not yet available. I believe also that you will agree that there have been no advances in chiropractic research and discovery which warrant the additional number of hours that certain individuals with a decided inferiority complex attitude wish to force upon the profession at this time. It is my opinion that we should be honest with ourselves and with the people and not try to deceive them by imitating others. I am sure that Dr. Willard Carver was correct in his vision recognizing the necessity for school organization activity, and it is my opinion that we should take active steps to keep the allied chiropractic educational institutions active in the matter of establishing and directing chiropractic educational policies. The last word I had in connection with yourself was that you were in the service, but from what Mrs. Carver says it would appear that you were back in civilian life again which, no doubt, is a great satisfaction to you. Trusting that I receive your active cooperation in this particular matter and in the perpetuation of the organization of schools, and with very best wishes to you personally and for the success of the Carver Chiropractic College, I am Yours very truly,... TFR:LD 1946 (Dec 23): unsigned letter to Loran M. Rogers, D.C. (CCE Archives #35-02-1956): Dear Dr. Rogers, On behalf of a committee composed of several Chiropractors I have been asked to write you in reference to advertising that is to be inserted for the Atlantic Chiropractic Institute, in Brooklyn, N.Y. This Institute is to be headed by one of a group of shrewd, unscrupulous and dishonest men who will stop at nothing to procure students. He intends to advertise in all New York newspapers and magazines which will not do our profession much credit. We ask you to investigate this School before accepting advertising. Dr. Nugent has been notified as to the status of said school and we suggest that you contact him at once. If our profession is to survive at all, we intend to have Schools' that will bring dignity to all Chiropractors instead of breaking down the morale that only such a school as outlined can bring about. Our Colleges in the past few years have made notable progress and Dr. Nugent and the N.C.A. are to be commended. If this Schoolis recognized and advertising inserted by the N.C.A. we will have retrogressed considerably.

Hoyt, D.C. of Burlington VT, president COSCEB, authors \"National Examining Board Organized\" (pp. 23, 59): The first official meeting of the National Chiropractic Examining Board was called to order at 10 A.M., Saturday, October 13, 1945, at the Belmont Plaza Hotel in New York City. Dr. Joseph S. Hoyt, President of the Council, from Burlington, Vt., presided. Eight members of the Council and four members of the National Examining Board were present. It had been hoped more could attend, but traveling conditions prevented a larger attendance. The morning was devoted to an informal discussion of the general problems facing the National Council and National Examining Board. The rather stormy history of the National Council of Chiropractic Examining Boards was briefly reviewed by members present. Dr. Hoyt reiterated the purposes of the present Council as follows: 1.To collect and correlate all important information (from all State Boards) relative to: (a)Educational requirements. (b)Scope of examinations. (c)Type of questions. 2.To arrive at a wholesale standard of examinations that would be comparable to that of the National Board of Medical Examiners. 3.To aid in every possible way the establishment of reciprocal arrangements with other State Boards - Basic Science and otherwise. 4.To create within the Council a National Board of Chiropractic Examiners to meet and give examinations once a year. 5.To render any and every aid (within its power to do so) to all State Chiropractic Boards. Dr. Hoyt stated that in accordance with instructions of the Chicago Convention of 1944 he had appointed the following as members of the National Board of Chiropractic Examiners: Dr. D.B. Mears, Batesville, Ark.; Dr. Edgar Northam, Baltimore, Md.; and that this was the first called meeting of this National Chiropractic Examining Board. It was also pointed out that this National Examining Board, to be effective, must eventually win recognition of the various State Boards. The initial problem will be to establish a prestige not only with State Boards through the rules and regulations governing the actions of their Boards, but also with state legislators for the purpose of additional statutes necessary to recognize a National Chiropractic Examining Board. With this discussion was presented a tabulation of the yearly raise in the educational requirements of chiropractic applicants in all states during the past 10 years. (a)At present 46 states recognize chiropractic in some form or other. (b)40 states require a chiropractic course of four years. (c)Six states require a course of four years. (d)The National Standard course requirement for the A.M.A. is at present four years consisting of 4400 hours. Dr. C.M. Kightlinger of the Institute of Chiropractic, N.Y. City, as well as Dr. Frank Dean of the Columbia Institute of Chiropractic, N.Y. City, were invited into the meeting for the purpose of giving the Board information relative to college position on requirements. Both educators recommended the higher standard of education, pointing out its necessity, due to younger students, scope of practice and prestige in the field. The following officers were duly nominated and elected to serve for a term of one year: Dr. D.B. Mears, Edgar Northam, Treasurer.It was moved and seconded that the Board shall admit to examination any candidate who pays a fee of $50 and submits evidence, certified by affidavits and satisfactory to the Bard, that he or she is: (a)Twenty-one years of age, or more. (b)Of good moral character. (c)A graduate of a high school course certified by the State Board of Education in the state of issuance. (d)A graduate of a chiropractic school, having studied a residence course of four academic years of eight months each in four different calendar years (or for not less than 32 months, with four equivalent satisfactory consecutive terms of at least eight months each), consisting of a minimum of 3600 class hours of 60 minutes. This motion was passed unanimously. Meeting re-convened at 10 A.M., Sunday, October 14, 1945. It was moved, seconded and passed unanimously that the National Board examinations shall embrace the following subjects: Anatomy, Histology, Physiology, Biochemistry, Bacteriology, Pathology, Diagnosis, Hygiene, Sanitation, Chiropractic Principles and Practices, and such other subjects as the Board may prescribe. And that each candidate shall attain an average grade of 75% or more on the several subjects embraced, with no grade lower than 657 [sic] on any one subject. It was duly moved and seconded that this Board meet once a year (at least) and that a 60-day (or more) notice of the time and place shall be given in all chiropractic publications throughout the nation. This motion was unanimously passed. Dr. A.W. Bradley, Treasurer of the Council, from New Castle, Del., joined the meeting and gave his report, which showed the treasury to be in a healthy condition. Dr. Bradley gave the Board the benefits of his past experience as a member of the Council since 1932. After a lengthy discussion the following resolution was adopted and it was urged that the President present the same to the Council for its consideration and adoption at its next regular session: WHEREAS, in the past, the objectives of the Council have been definitely hampered by the misconception that said Council was sponsored by various organizations. WE HEREBY RESOLVE that the National Council of Chiropractic Examining Boards and it Board of Examiners be separate and distinct from any and all national associations and institutions. In consideration of the above resolution: WE FURTHER RESOLVE that any and all meetings of the National Council of Chiropractic Examining Boards or of its Board of Examiners be held in places as centrally located as possible and at different times from any state or national chiropractic convention or any homecoming of any chiropractic institution. In order to arrive at a standard of examination, Dr. Mears, Chairman of the Board, relegated to himself the task of writing, as soon as possible, to all state boards of examiners requesting copies of as many examination papers as procurable. It is fervently hoped that all such boards will cooperate in every way possible. 1946: Columbia College of Chiropractic (CCC), in Baltimore, is founded by Frank Dean (Official, 1993; Rehm, 1980, p. 298) PHOTOGRAPHCampus of the Columbia College of Chiropractic in Baltimore (Miscellany, 1985) Left to right: student Robert Davies, Frances Orner, D.C. & student Ed Kimmel at the Columbia Institute, 1946 (courtesy of Michael Moross, D.C.)

Franklin Street, Baltimore to Cleveland Chiropractic College of Kansas (CCC/KC archives; in my NYCC file): Gentlemen: I am sure that by this time you received an invitation from the NCA to join the so called \"Fully Accredited\" schools in placing two page advertisement in their Journal. We are not accepting this invitation for the following reason - no prospect sold on the NCA accrediting system will enter only - \"Provisionally Approved\" - or the so called \"Associated College.\" Sincerely Yours,... 1951 (Nov 17): letter from Carl Cleveland Jr. to Thure C. Peterson DC (Cleveland papers, CCC/KC): Dear Dr. Peterson: We believe the combination advertisement is a good idea. Naturally we feel that discriminatory listings are hardly fair since all Colleges are in a State of Change. Staff members in one fully accredited College give penicillin and other drugs openly and teach Bootleg medicine and surgery in that fully accredited Chiropractic Colege and in direct violation of Chiropractic principles and their State Law. This is a situation that could do much damage to us in Congress and should not be consistently be condoned, ignored and approved by a National Council of Chiropractic education especially in an N.C.A. fully accredited School. The ultimate odor and Publicity throughout the rest of the nation will not reflect credit on the N.C.A. For that reason we believe the plain listings without ratings would be fair to all, encourage greater cooperation and react more favorably to all concerned in the final analysis. However, we will go along with the idea as an Associated School if you desire to handle it that way. The center spread, as Dr. Rogers suggests, is a fine location. It is our intention to be at the Chicago meeting and cooperate the best possible always for the benefit of Chiropractic. Thanking you for your consideration and with kindest personal regards to you and your institution, I remain, Very sincerely yours... 1951 (Dec): JNCA [21(12)] includes: -Louis A.

Parr, D.C., president of Carver Chiropractic College, on college stationery; this will lead to the formation of the NAACSC (in my Carver files): TO ALL CHIROPRACTIC SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES ON THE NORTH AMERICAN CONTINENT: After considerable discussion with the heads of other schools at the last several State Association meetings and much correspondence in the last sixty days, it seems to have fallen my lot to extend to you an invitation to attend a meeting, the date for which is tentatively set as March 8, 1952, the location for which is tentatively set for Chicago, since it is centrally located and has excellent transportation possibilities. The purpose of this meeting is the discussion of school problems by school men. You are cordially invited to be represented by any or all bona fide representatives of your school. We urge that you be represented by at least one of your clear-thinking, forward-looking authorities. In recent correspondence with deans and presidents of chiropractic colleges I have made many suggestions as to possibilities of organization of schools, etc. I had thought at first that I would include in this invitation a proposed outline for a school organization. I had even thought of stating my position as to having another accrediting association, but I have been advised by the president of one of the chiropractic colleges that this might be taken on the part of some of you as meaning that decisions have been made, when they have not. Should like to quote three sentences from this great educator's letter to me: \"I feel the only thing that is needed is an invitation to the schools to attend a called meeting, which would contain a designated place and time to consider mutual problems for the benefit of all. At the conclusion of such a meeting an association of chiropractic schools and colleges might be formed if that was the consensus of opinion of those in attendance. By this I mean that any action that might be taken and the nature of any association that might be formed would entirely depend upon those attending the meeting.\" It is a little difficult for me to inculcate in this letter the urgency I feel without discussing some of the problems of endangering the proposition by giving the impression that conclusions have already been formed. So, again let me invite you and even strongly urge you that in the interest of unity and advancement of our profession and toward the goal of better health services for our people, please, let us once get the brains of the school business into a close-harmony meeting.

Dean, founder of New York's Columbia Institute of Chiropractic (in 1919) and Columbia College of Chiropractic, Baltimore, Maryland (in 1940) joined his two illustrious contemporaries, Dr. Leo Spears and Dr. James R. Drain, who have recently preceded him into the Great Beyond (Dr. Spears, two years ago; and Dr. Drain in February, 1958). FOUGHT FOR CHIROPRACTIC RECOGNITION A kindly, intelligent and energetic man with his students and colleagues, he was a fighter for recognition of his chosen profession in New York State, and suffered disappointment when each session of the legislature rejected licensure for chiropractors, only to renew the battle as opportunity presented itself each biennium. Born Oct. 13, 1891, in Easton, Pennsylvania, Dr. Dean studied in Europe, receiving his doctorate at the University of Warsaw. He was keenly interested in all branches of the healing arts, and furthered his education with courses in advanced anatomy and bacteriology at the University of Heidelberg, Germany, where he studied under the famed Adolf Lorenz, Austrian surgeon. He later engaged in research at the Sorbonne, Paris, France; and took post-graduate work at the Imperial Institute of Russia, under Prof. Serge Voronoff, one of the world's noted neurologists. His insatiable curiosity led him to far outposts of scientific research, where he learned healing techniques from masters in their fields. He was conversant with fifteen languages, which were invaluable to him in his travels through Asia, Africa, Central and South America, always searching for more knowledge. His bent was for Medicine but, on returning to the United States before World War 1, he became more and more impressed by the scope and effectiveness of Chiropractic, and zealously embrace the young science. He was influenced in this decision by the circumstance that, at the age of 14, he was cured of rheumatic heart through Chiropractic therapy after other methods failed to relieve the condition. GENIUS IN TEACHING OTHERS Though he was magnificently qualified as a practitioner, his peculiar gift was in transmitting knowledge to younger and less experienced men and women. He freely shared his research findings and the techniques he developed with all who demonstrated their willingness to learn. \"Spears Painless System\" was taught at both Columbia Institute and Columbia College of Chiropractic. It is a little-known fact that, in addition to his prodigious education in Medicine and Chiropractic, he also spent three years studying Osteopathy...He married Katherine Welch, one of his students at Columbia Institute of Chiropractic, who is Dr. Dean's sole survivor, according to best-informed sources. She is a brilliant pianist, in addition to her other professional talents. Dr. Dean held Fellowships in the International Chiropractic Association and American College of Chiropractic, among other high honors that came to him. \"WE SHALL NEVER SEE HIS LIKE...\" A contemporary said of him when he learned of Dr. Dean's death: \"We shall never again see his like. He was a sincere and kind leader of men. He pursued a course and way of life in the early days of Chiropractic that would have brought defeat to one of lesser stamina.\" * * * (NOTE: Dr. Dean was know as a \"man of mystery\" even to his colleagues, preferring to talk about Chiropractic rather than his own background, travels, studies, family and personal affairs. We are greatly indebted to Edwin Goldberg, editor of THE COLUMBIAN, Columbia Institute of Chiropractic's official publication, for the data which has enabled us to penetrate the veil that has obscured much of Dr. Dean's history.) 1958 (July): ICA International Review of Chiropractic [13(1)] includes: -\"Licensing facts presentation on TV\" (p.9): A half-hour television show on \"Why Should Chiropractors Be Licensed in New York State\" recently was presented on station WABD in New York City by the Chiropractic Association of New York.

Dr. Barber distinguished himself as a medic with the 5th Army Rangers. While in the Army Medical Corp, Dr. Barber received the DSC for extraordinary heroism in action on June 6, 1944, in France. According to the official citation, Pfc. Barber landed with his medical unit on the coast of France at a time when the beach was under heavy enemy rifle, machine-gun and artillery fire. A tremendous number of injured already were in need of aid. In spite of the heavy fire, Pfc. Barber constantly exposed himself to the direct fire of the enemy as he went along the beach administering to the wounded. At one time he took a horse and cart into the middle of the barrage to carry out three wounded men. In addition to the DSC, Dr. Barber was awarded the Purple Heart Medal, Good Conduct Medal, Distinguished Unit Badge with Cluster, European-African Middle Eastern Medal with four battle stars and Arrowhead. Last year he was further honored by election to membership in the Army and Navy Legion of Valor. Dr. Barber is a 1942 graduate of Johnstown High School.

Logan, Logan College of Chiropractic. ---------- Louisville, Ky. - The Kentuckiana Children's Chiropractic Center in Louisville, celebrated the sixty-fifth anniversary of chiropractic in a grand way as the Lambert Wing was dedicated September 20. Five hundred persons including top local and state civic officials and national chiropractic luminaries were on hand to observe the occasion. The ribbon cutting ceremony was handled by Dr. Vinton F. Logan, St. Louis; Dr. Arthur G. Hendricks, Indianapolis; Dr. Lorraine Golden, Executive Director of the Kentuckiana Children's Chiropractic Center; Mr. Ed Fawcett, Admiistrative Assistant to Governor Bert Combs; and Dr. K.C. Murphy, Louisville. With the opening of this addition to the Center, named in honor of Kentucky oilman H.L. Lambert, a notable benefactor of the Center, a new era in the care of Kentuckiana's Physically and Mentally handicapped children was opened. The new wing includes a spacious Physical Re-development Department; a Research Department where records may be copiled and kept centrally on the progress of each patient. In addition, Psychology, Chiropody, Audio Visual and Sociologists facilities have been set up on a staff consulting basis with no actual care being rendered, but for evaluation of patient progress. Dr. Hendricks, Dr. Logan and Dr. Joseph A. Cataldo, representing the Atlantic States School in Brooklyn, were unanimous in their praise for the Center's progress and the prospects for the future with the new departments and the great value of the project to the Chiropractic profession. \"This Center personifies 'togetherness' in the profession with an object in view... providing a humanitarian phase of the development of chiropractic,\" viewed Dr. Hendricks. \"A realization,\" added Dr. Logan, \"of the profession's responsibility as a servant of humanity. In addition, it is undoubtedly a giant stride in the direction of chiropractic unity.\" Dr. Cataldo expressed great interest in the newly added Research Department, extolling the potential value of such a control of statitics and records. Center Officials estimate that 100 to 150 more children will be admitted to the Center in the next twelve months due to the additional services available and the increased facilities. \"The increase,\" according to Dr. Golden, will probably begin with the admittance very shortly of two childen to the Physical Re-Development States, Cleveland/KC, Cleveland/LA, Columbia, International Chiropractic College in Dayton OH, Logan Basic, and PSC; many photos; includes: ATLANTIC STATES CHIROPRACTIC INSTITUTE Chartered under the laws of the State of Maryland, the Atlantic States Chiropractic Institute was founded in Brooklyn by Dr. Martin I Phillips and Dr. N.

Because of his having lived, millions of pain- free years will be added to millions of lives, for as long as the human race survives. B.J., as president of the Palmer School of Chiropractic, the Palmer Enterprises and the International Chiropractors Association, was the first of the chiropractic leaders to endorse the Parker course after the very first Seminar was presented in Florida a decade ago. Thank you, B.J.... thank you so much. God rest your soul, and yes, \"We love you because you love the same things we love\" and \"We will carry on.\" Jim and Mary -\"Share No. 94\" (inside front cover, p. 92) includes: THE FABULOUS FOURTH - \"The Omega and Alpha\" - and FABULOUS it was - ended Sunday afternoon, May 28th, after five days filled to the brim with practice-building, office-procedure, success - and healing - consciousness education, inspiration, illustration and association for about 1,000 BB's and BB'ettes. Aptly named the \"Omega and Alpha,\" the 123rd Seminar not only welcomed BB's whose names begin with every letter of the alphabet, from Zimbeck to Abels, and had representation from every state and province either in person or by telegram, but marked \"the end and the beginning\" with the announcement of B.J.'s death on Saturday morning, and the first official appearance of Dr. Dave Palmer (below) as the new head of the Palmer School of Chiropractic in a stirring 2- 1/2 hour address Saturday night. At the Saturday banquet, he gratefully accepted the presentation of three honorary degrees of Philosopher of Chiropractic (Ph.C.) by Atlantic States Chiropractic Institute, Columbia Institute of Chiropractic, and Cleveland Chiropractic College, L.A.; a beautiful silver tray bearing the Palmer School of Chiropractic crest and the inscription \"In Appreciation of Valued Service to the Chiropractic Profession\" (the first of its kind given); and a Texas Trophy from the Texas Chiropractic College... 1961 (Nov/Dec): Digest of Chiropractic Economics [4(3)] includes: -\"We visit the Institute 14-5, 20-1, 25); indicates Napolitano is \"U.N. representative from the American Association for Studies of the United Nations\"; includes many photographs: Left to right: Dr. Boland, Dorothy Marsh Geisinger & Ernest Napolitano, D.C. at the United Nations \"One Institute of Chiropractic, in New York City, combines the prestige and know how of age - based on 42 years of service - with the look of complete modernity... The modern look comes from the complete modernization program which was carried on between July 2, 1960, and April 1, 1961. In that period there were added to the facilities an imposing group of physical improvements... \"Very important in our scheme of things is the Institute's four- year course (4,490 hours). Within this four-year curriculum, the science , art and philosophy of Chiropractic get the primary positions... Founded by Frank E. Dean in 1919, Columbia is fully approved the Education Commission of the International Chiropractors Association, the North American Association of Chiropractic Schools and Colleges and is accredited by state boards of Chiropractic examiners. It is controlled by the Board of Trustees - with Dr. Napolitano as chairman and the appointed administrative officers. The outstanding citizens who are members of the Board of Trustees donate their services. Other members of the board are Lorraine Welch, Jack Lowenfeld, Adelaide Moore (Member emeritus), Justin Barber and Clifford Zoller. The administrative staff, in addition to President Napolitano, is composed of Dr. Welch, educational consultant, Martin Greenberg, director of education, and John A. Mazzaferre, registrar. Dr. Napolitano was named to the top administrative post Nov. 29, 1959. A lecturer, author and educator, Dr. Napolitano is a graduate of the Palmer School of Chiropractic. He served on the staff of the B.J. Palmer Clinic for one year and entered into private practice in 1942. He is widely recognized as one of the outstanding practitioners in New York State. Columbia's president has won many honors and awards. In 1958, the Chiropractic Association of New York, District No. 2, recognized him for his television in behalf of Chiropractic by presenting him with a plaque. In the same year he won the degree F.A.C.C. from the American College of Chiropractors for his contributions to Chiropractic education and lecture activities. He also was admitted as a Fellow of the International Chiropractors Association. Dr. Napolitano also holds the degrees Sc.D., Ph.D. and Ph.C... The institute he heads is located within a few minutes walk of many scenic and historic points of interest. Riverside Drive, with its large municipal athletic field along the Hudson River is but one block west and Central Park is two blocks east. Yet the school is just one block from the subway station and five minutes from Times Square, making it easily reached by its students. Because the Museum of History, Hayden Planetarium and the Metropolitan Museum of Art are all within walking distance, Columbia's students are afforded an unusual cultural opportunity. The Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts is also nearby. Columbia aims to train and educate its students fully in the fundamentals. Research programs constantly carried on at the institution enable the staff to deliver modern, complete professional education to the students. The curriculum is so designed to prepare students for Chiropractic and basic science examining boards. The library contains more than 2,000 volumes available to students. The course of studies consists of four years of ten months each, covering 4,490 hours. Each candidate for graduation must pass to the satisfaction of the faculty all prescribed courses and examinations, complete a minimum of 36 months of resident attendance, be of good moral character and be over 21 years of age. Transfer students from other Chiropractic schools must have at least 18 months of residence at Columbia. Post-graduate courses are offered to graduate chiropractors in the areas of Chiropractic techniques, office procedure, spinography and practical laboratory analysis as it pertains to Chiropractic.Columbia offers a special course to persons who desire to prepare for a career as a chiropractors' office assistant. It consists of nine consecutive months of training and includes the use of Chiropractic instruments, spinographic practice, proper placing for all types of spinographs, X-ray physics and darkroom procedure. A well-rounded extra-curricular program is offered. Alpha Chi Omega Fraternity is open to the undergraduates for the promotion of good fellowship. A sorority also has been formed. The student Council weekly discusses student problems with the faculty advisory board. The school has teams in bowling, baseball and basketball and the student body sponsors many social functions during the academic year, including the annual Christmas Party and Spring dance. Public speaking is strongly ;encouraged, with training in the art of serving as toastmasters or toast =mistresses. Columbia has a national representative on the Student Activity Committee. A monthly publication - Columbian News - gives those so inclined a chance to test their journalistic abilities. Of particular interest to many seeking to launch careers in Chiropractic is the Columbia Adjusting Service. Because the Institute is located in a metropolitan center, this service draws a large number of people. This gives students the full opportunity to become practically familiar with the analysis and adjustment of many types of cases - under the exact conditions that will prevail when they begin their private practice... New York also has the attraction of unlimited opportunities for part-time and full-time employment for Chiropractic students who require additional funds, Dr. Napolitano said. The Columbia staff will assist in placing students in various positions. The school itself also offers a limited number of jobs. The housing in New York is also considered ample for the needs of Columbia students. Many modest hotels, rooming and boarding houses are available plus the facilities of the YMCA and YWCA. Many of these facilities are equipped for light housekeeping, and it is possible for two or more students to share quarters to cut costs. The school has a housing placement bureau. Columbia meets the full requirements of the law which makes it possible to grant draft deferment to matriculated students at fully accredited Chiropractic colleges on the same basis as given to students attending other healing arts schools.

Logan, 1905-1961\" (p. 2): Dr. Vinton F. Logan died on Sunday morning, July 9, 1961. Dr. Logan was born in Peoria, Illinois on July 1, 1905, son of Hugh B. and Wilhelmina Logan, both of whom enrolled in Chiropractic college while Dr. Vinton was a boy. Following their graduation the family moved to Atchison, Kansas where Dr. Hugh B. Logan began practice. Dr. Vinton attended St. Benedict's College in Atchison and the Universal Chiropractic College in Pittsburgh. He received his Chiropractic degree on July 1, 1926. He practiced with his father in Los Angeles, California for three years and then took over the practice himself. He joined with his father in the promotion of full-spine work in 1934 and became the Dean of Logan Basic College of Chiropractic in St. Louis when it opened in 1935. In addition to administrative work at the college, Dr. Vinton traveled the country and taught graduate work to doctors in the field from 1934 to 1944. He became President of Logan College following the passing of his father in 1944. Dr. Logan was a member of the Legislative Committee of the Missouri State Chiropractors' Assn, Secretary-Treasurer of the International Basic Technique Research Institute, member of the I.C.A. Board of Control and member of the President's Cabinet. Dr. Logan's death is certainly a great loss to our profession. He was a man of courage and vision, an inspiring speaker and a dynamic personality who lived and loved Chiropractic. -Ernest G.

Agreement on a basic minimum curriculum was regarded as something needed very much for many years by all chiropractic colleges. A standard form for transfer of class credits, grades and hours between colleges and the various state examining boards was worked out. Another important step was the agreement to create a National Board of Chiropractic Examiners.The Council of State Chiropractic Examining Boards was responsible for the conference. For some time the Council has felt it could be a strong factor in getting the NCA and ICA Educational Commissions together in an effort to iron out some of the problems. It was finally agreed that a committee of three men from the Council - in this case the officers - and three members of the other two Educational Commissions would be the best procedure to follow. Present from the ICA Education Commission were Dr. William N. Coggins, president of the Logan Basic Chiropractic College, St. Louis; Dr. Ernest G. Napolitano, president of the Columbia Institute of Chiropractic, New York; and Dr. Kenneth Cronk, acting dean of the Palmer College of Chiropractic, Davenport. Representing the NCA Council on Education were Dr. George H. Haynes, dean of the Los Angeles College of Chiropractic, Glendale; Dr. J.B. Wolfe, president of the Northwestern College of Chiropractic, Minneapolis; and Dr. Joseph Janse, president of the National College of Chiropractic, Chicago. The Council members present were Dr. Devere E. Biser, president (vice-president of ICA), Dallas, Texas; Dr. R. Dwayne Moulton, vice president (president-elect of NCA), Boise, Idaho; and Dr. Gordon L. Holman, secretary, Cheyenne, Wyoming. Dr. Biser presided and Dr. Holman kept the minutes of the meeting. All official actions taken at this meeting must be passed upon favorably by the Education Commission of the ICA and the National Council on Education of the NCA and then approved by their respective boards of the ICA and the NCA before the plans can be activated. However, the Council is setting up machinery to explore the feasibility of creating a National Examining Board. Most other professions have active national examining boards, which are working with the state examining boards. It is fully realized it will take time to ratify these proposed plans and the action steps will not be functioning for some time. The General Committee definitely feels this conclave is a good pilot for more such meetings. This conference was a most harmonious, fact- finding, cards-on-the-table affair participated in by doctors of chiropractic trying to produce unified action on the educational front. A meeting is being planned in the near future to discuss other problems in the educational field - such as the standardization of textbooks. 1962 (Jan/Feb): Digest of Chiropractic Economics [4(4)] includes: -photo of Daniel Sternberg, D.C. and caption (p. 24): DR.

Dr. Ernest G. Napolitano, President of Columbia, delivered an inspiring address to the graduates and guests. He stated that Chiropractic is beyond its infancy stage. It is a mature profession, enjoying world-wide recognition as a needed health science. Its maturity is reflected in the quality of its practitioners and the nature of its educational institutions. The graduates and visitors were honored to have as their guest speaker Dr. Devere Biser of Dallas, Texas, President of the Council of State Chiropractic Examining Boards, Past President and present member of the Texas Board of Chiropractic Examiners and Vice President of the International Chiropractors Association. Dr. Biser presented a stimulating Commencement address suggesting that the new graduates accept the challenges of tomorrow by utilizing a constructive momentum created by our pioneers.

Following the Commencement, a Banquet in the Grand Ballroom of the Park Sheraton Hotel was attended by more than 500 guests. Dr. George Adelman from Brockton, Massachusetts, was Toastmaster. Meritorious awards were presented to Doctors Justin Barber, Lorraine Welch, Fred Sears and Devere Biser for their outstanding contributions to the Chiropractic profession. The final presentation of the evening was made to Dr. Daniel Surace by the President of the graduating class expressing thanks toDr. Surace for his counsel and wholehearted cooperation while serving as Advisor to the June, 1962, graduates.

During personal interviews with these young ladies and gentlemen our Advisory staff concluded the necessity of establishing a program of instruction for their families and relatives. It has been the impression of our staff that much misunderstanding and confusion develops in the minds of new students because members of their families have a limited understanding of Chiropractic and its role in the field of health. Therefore, a special course was organized covering 40 hours of class work. The first session was held on Saturday, September 29th, under the direction of Reginald Gold, Acting Dean. Lectures in the area of Chiropractic Principles, Practice and Philosophy have been received with overwhelming enthusiasm. More important, it gives our staff an opportunity to orientate families and relatives of our undergraduates enabling them to assist in the growth and development of our students by understanding what Chiropractic is, what it does and to, first hand, relate the academic experiences in which their loved ones are involved. We are pleased to report that the President of our Alumni Association, Dr. Michael Sabia, indicated that our graduates are embarking upon an active fund raising program to assist the Board of Trustees with their plans to establish new facilities. Details of this extensive building program will be reported within the next few months.

Dr. Ralph Littman, Director of the program, indicated that all Doctors participating in this effort will receive a list of films that are available. Suitably engrossed certificates have been sent to the Doctors of Chiropractic who have indicated confidence in our research effort by donating valuable roentgenographic specimens. March 9, 1963 marked the completion of our first non- matriculated course for women in Chiropractic. Under the direction of Dr. Reginald Gold, forty hours of Chiropractic principles, practice and philosophy was offered to this special class. A formal commencement ritual included a spiritual bouquet from Reverend Father Freeston. Dr. Ernest Napolitano, President of Columbia, delivered an inspiring address and called upon the graduate women to disseminate the knowledge and information that they have received during their course of study. He also announced an advanced course to be offered in Chiropractic Principles. Office Procedure and Patient Management to the women who have successfully completed the first phase of the non-matriculated course offered at Columbia. Dr. Reginald Gold, Special Class Director, presented Certificates of Completion to the following graduates: JoAnn Stipkovich, Marion P. Gargiso, Phyllys B. Gross, Miriam H. Nugget, Marlene B. Werner, Joan C.P. Gaffney and Lore Wieland. The Columbia Cultural Society, under the direction of Dr. Salvatore Curreri, reports enthusiastic reception on the part of the student body here at C.I.C. The curriculum includes lectures and visual slides on sculpturing, painting, a study of the decline and fall of the Roman Empire, literature, and modern, ancient and medieval history. Field trips will include the theatre, museums and art galleries.-\"College reports: Atlantic States.\" (p. 24); includes photo of Dr. Martin I.

Littman. Phase 1 of this program will be to establish a Central X-ray Library. It is the intention of our staff to include films depicting dislocations, congenital anomalies, osseous and soft-tissue pathologies and various spinal distortions. All material compiled will be used in conjunction with our under-graduate programs in X-ray and also presented at our graduate seminars. The school is requesting cooperation from the profession and suggesting that all chiropractors who have films denoting the above conditions donate these valuable plates to our Central X-ray Library. Many thousands of excellent roentgenographic specimens are currently occupying file space in offices throughout the country. These films could be put to excellent use in the best interest of our profession. Briefly, the X-ray Library will operate in this manner: Films donated by the Doctor of Chiropractic will be regarded as a loan. The custodian of the Library will be responsible for storage and maintenance of their property. Should the doctor wish to recall an X- ray that he has donated, it will be returned to him by registered mail immediately upon his request. A certificate indicating participation in this program will be issued to all doctors who cooperate. Each film will be appropriately identified indicating the donor's name and address. Plans are also being developed to provide rare films on a loan basis to other chiropractic colleges. We respectfully request that any doctor who desires to donate films for this program write to the COLUMBIA INSTITUTE OF CHIROPRACTIC, 261 West 71st Street, New York 23, N.Y. (Attention: Central X-Ray Library). 1963 (Apr): JCaCA [19(10)] notes: -\"New York licensing legislation passed\" (p. 3) On Friday, March 29, the Peterson Bill to license the practice of chiropractic in New York State was passed by the Senate by a vote 38to 20, following a public hearing. The House passed the bill by a vote of 99 to 33 on March 29. This culminated fifty years of effort. Governor Rockefeller presented a special message to the legislature urging passage of the bill drafted by his aides. The measure was also supported by the State Education Department and Board of Regents, which agencies administer the laws pertaining to all professions. 1963 (May/June): Digest of Chiropractic Economics [5(6)] includes: -\"New York wins 50 year battle: chiropractic licensing bill signed\" (p. 36) -Morris K.

An outstanding authority in the field of Mexican art and fashion, Mr. Fred Leighton, addressed the guests present. Members of the Columbia Chapter modeled the beautiful Mexican fashions provided by Mexican Imports, Inc. Prior to inaugurating the Fashion Show program, Mrs. Noel Stipkovich, President, expressed thanks to Mrs. Frank Wieland for designing and producing the official Columbia Chapter banner. It is with deep appreciation that the ladies of the Chapter express thanks to the many organizations, department stores and cosmetic houses that donated the prizes which were raffled off. Following all of these wonderful festivities, the evening came to a close with a Mexican Buffet that brought a touch of old Mexico to New York City. The Board of Trustees of the Columbia Institute of Chiropractic held their annual Commencement and Banquet commemorating the June, 1963 graduating class at the Hotel Roosevelt in New York City on June 29th. Commencement Exercises began at 4:30 P.M. followed by a Banquet held in the Grand Ballroom. Mr. Andre Baruch, Vice President of Helitzer, Waring and Wain Advertising Agency, the voice behind many T.V. productions, Announcer for the Hit Parade program on radio and television for more than twenty-two years, the voice of Pathe News for over twenty years, currently Announcer for the United States Steel Hour and Narrator of I.C.A.'s television film, \"Search for Health,\" was the honored guest speaker at the Commencement and Banquet. Dr. Napolitano, President of Columbia, also announced that Dr. William N. Coggins, President of the Logan Basic College of Chiropractic in St. Louis, Missouri, received the degree, Doctor of Science, honoris causa, for his extraordinary contributions to theacademic, cultural and social development in the field of Chiropractic education. 1963: NYS passes chiropractic licensing law (Official, 1993) 1963 (Sept/Oct): Digest of Chiropractic Economics [6(2)] includes: -\"College reports: Atlantic Review [18(5)] includes: -\"Columbia Institute has record fall class: 187 students enrolled; ICA student recruitment pogram reaches 2,500,000 students\" (p. 17) (Nov/Dec): -\"College reports: Columbia Inst.\" (pp. 35-6): The school year September 1963, marked the forty-fifth anniversary of the Columbia Institute of Chiropractic. The officers and faculty were pleased to welcome seventy-one new students in our Fall class. It is worthy to note that more than 58% of the new freshmen attended at least two years of college. The Columbia Chapter to the Women's Auxiliary of the International Chiropractors Association sponsored a Freshman Dance at the Hotel Roosevelt honoring these new students entering Columbia. Since the enactment of Chiropractic legislation on July 1, 1963 our graduate division has actively embarked upon a program to prepare present practitioners to negotiate state examinations. Courses are being offered at our college in Basic Science subjects to doctors in the under two and two to seven year categories. Simultaneously, courses are also being offered to doctors in the seven to fifteen year group in the area of Fundamentals of Anatomy and Physiology. Those Chiropractors in practice for more than fifteen years are following courses in the area of Principles and Practice. A program of instruction covering the topic of Use and Effects of X-ray will be initiated during the month of November. By selection, any present practitioner who desired to use X-ray in his practice will be required to take a state examination in the Use and Effects of X-ray. We are proud to announce that attendance at the Columbia courses being offered in New York City and Buffalo, New York is indicative of the quality of instruction being presented by our Instructors on our regular faculty staff who are highly skilled and qualified and who have the responsibility of preparing our undergraduate students to pass Basic Science and Chiropractic Boards throughout America. Dr. Napolitano, announced on November 1st the appointment of Dr. Herbert Jan of Forest Hills, New York, as Clinic Director and Dr. Louis Newman from Scranton, Pennsylvania, as Assistant to the Clinic Director. The astronomical influx of new students required the furnishing of two additional classrooms and a student activity lounge. It is significant to note that our plans for the establishment of new facilities are rapidly progressing. However, it is essential as long as we remain in our current buildings that suitable accommodations be made to satisfy the faculty and student compliment. We here at Columbia wish to express sincere thanks to the publishers of the Digest of Chiropractic Economics for offering us the opportunity to report our college activities to the readers and subscribers of this publication. -\"College reports: Atlantic States\" (p. 37) -\"ACA softens 'Life Quackery Article'\" (p. 40): Webster City, Ia. - Prior to the appearance of the article \"Crackdown on Quackery\" (Nov. 1) in Life magazine, the New ACA, through its legal department, contacted Life in order to prevent the publication of anything detrimental to the chiropractic profession.Dr. Clyde Martyn, new ACA Interim President, issued an official policy statement to Life's regional correspondent in California, while the story was being prepared. In addition to its coverage of Dr. Marvin Phillips, Life also reported on the activities of Dr. Ruth Drown, but did not identify her as a chiropractor. Although the article was slanted, no direct attacks were made on the profession, nor did it single out in a derogatory manner chiropractic as a profession, or its techniques. The Life article would likely have been worse, had not the ACA intervened to prevent publication of an anti-chiropractic article in its early development. 1964 (Jan/Feb): Digest of 46): The rapid maturity, growth and development of our Chiropractic colleges during the next two or three years is essential if our profession is to achieve the academic, social and cultural recognition that it deserves. Quality of instruction must be maintained at a level reflecting academic excellence. Procedure of admission of students should include adequate assurances to the Admission Board of the college that the basic potential for professional development exists. The Executive Committee here at Columbia ruled during their October, 1963 meeting that all applicants for admission to Columbia will be required to pass an admission's test. This program was activated with our January, 1964 prospective freshmen. The evaluation will be made by a registered, certified, psychological testing organization. Dr. Napolitano announced the appointment of Dr. Alvin E. Stein as a new member of the Faculty. Dr. Stein is assigned to the Department of Laboratory Diagnosis. A registered New York State Librarian has been employed and will be placed in charge of our library facilities. Other activities included a highly successful student Christmas Social sponsored by the Columbia Institute of Chiropractic. More than 150 students and their guests gathered at the Manhattan Towers Hotel in New York City on Saturday, December 14th. The Annual Columbia Faculty Dinner was held in the Grill Room of the Hotel Roosevelt on Saturday, December 21st. Officers, members of the Faculty and their wives were present. The entertainment featured Julius LaRosa. 1964 (Feb): ACA Journal of Chiropractic [1(2)] includes: -photograph & caption (p. 25): The ACA Council on Education is shown around the conference table at midyear meeting (left to right): Dr. L.F.

Napolitano, D.C., Ph.C., F.A.C.C., president of Columbia Institute of Chiropractic, has announced his resignation as a member of the Board of Control of the International Chiropractors Association. His action - which he took \"with regret\" - followed upon the passing of a resolution by the ICA Board of Control at its February meeting in San Francisco. This resolution stated that the I.C.A. cannot allow dual accreditation of colleges by I.C.A. and any agency representing a scope of practice in conflict with the I.C.A. scope of practice. Dr. Napolitano earlier had announced that he had applied to the American Chiropractic Association for accreditation of Columbia Institute. In explaining his resignation from I.C.A., Dr. Napolitano said: \"During my 20 years as a chiropractor, I have devoted myself to the preservation of the principle of Chiropractic. \"I believe all during my tenure as a member of the I.C.A. Board of Control that the I.C.A. has vigorously defended the Chiropractic principle. \"However, I had the privilege of attending the A.C.A. midyear meeting at Palm Springs, Calif., in January. I had the opportunity of talking to a group of men who I believe are likewise interested in the preservation of the Chiropractic principle. I have no doubt that both groups are sincere Chiropractic benefactors. \"I do not believe that the A.C.A. today holds the answers to all of our professional problems. However, I firmly believe that one major Chiropractic organization is essential if our profession expects to achieve appropriate recognition. \"Combining the talents of the I.C.A. and A.C.A. educationally and politically, in my opinion, will produce a potent force that will assure the growth and development of a time-honored profession. \"Mankind, the ultimate consumer of Chiropractic must be protected. In order for humanity to continue to receive the benefits of Chiropractic, we are mandated to combine forces and combat the insidious onslaught and invasionary tactics of medicine. \"The efficacy of Chiropractic has been adequately demonstrated in millions of patients since the first adjustment was delivered by D.D. Palmer in 1895. Lack of unity without our profession may cause us to lose this wonderful health principle by default.\" Dr. Napolitano made the point that Chiropractic was being deprived of certain monetary rights - one specifically, the opportunity for U.S. Government business loans - because of this lack of unity in the profession.Another typical loss, he said, comes through the failure of some insurance companies to grant recognition - a matter he believes could be corrected by a united, and therefore stronger, profession. \"I am convinced that a unified front is essential to the survival and growth of Chiropractic,\" Dr. Napolitano continued. \"Therefore, with the approval of the Board of Trustees of Columbia Institute of Chiropractic, I have requested A.C.A. accreditation. \"It is important to note that the Chiropractic philosophy and the basic fundamental principles of Chiropractic will continue to be taught to our students here at Columbia. \"As an individual, my devotion and dedication to the wonderful health principles of Chiropractic have not, and will not, be altered. As an institution, Columbia will always offer instruction that will lend dignity and prestige to the Chiropractic profession. \"Over the years during my association with the I.C.A., I have made numerous friends, I cherish the many pleasant memories and experiences. It is my earnest hope that this action on my part will not cause any hard feelings. \"My intention is not to hurt the I.C.A., but to perhaps stimulate an interest on the part of the Board of Control to focus their attention on the future of Chiropractic and combine programs and talents for the good of a profession and sick people throughout the world.\" Dr. Napolitano has been president of Columbia Institute of Chiropractic since November, 1959. He is credited with leading the program by which Columbia has gained national stature and international recognition. He has been a member of the I.C.A. Education Commission, chairman of the Veterans Affairs program and served on the Budget, Personnel and Constitutional Revision committees. He is a graduate of the Palmer School of Chiropractic and served on the staff of the B.J. Palmer Clinic one year before entering private practice in 1942. He is considered one of the most outstanding and successful practitioners in New York State and holds many honors. The degree of F.A.C.C. was conferred on him in 1958 by the American College of Chiropractors for his contributions to Chiropractic education and lecture activities. He was also admitted as a Fellow of the I.C.A. the same year. The degrees of Sc.D., Ph.D. and Ph.C. were conferred honoris causa. He also holds B.S., LL.B., D.C., and Ph.C. degrees earned in courses. He has served with the United Nations as a representative for the American Association for Studies of the UN, the only chiropractor with this world organization. Dr. Napolitano is a member of the National Academy of Chiropractors, Chiropractic Association of New York, New Hampshire Chiropractic Association, Massachusetts Association of Chiropractors, American Society of Audiometrists and has been chairman of the board of the Queens Elementary School, a private institution. He holds decorations from the Pope for services to the churches and for helping the needy in the New York area. -\"ACA mid-year meeting reports major actions\" (p. 46): PALM SPRINGS, CALIF. (ACA) - The midyear meeting of the ACA Executive Board of Governors, Executive Action Committee, and Council on Education was held on January 11-16, 1964, at the Riviera Hotel, Palm Springs, California. Highlights of the meeting included the following actions: Logan Basic College of Chiropractic, St. Louis, Missouri, became a member of the ACA Council on Education and was granted the same status as other ACA colleges. The ACA name issue with the California ACA group was resolved by conference with Dr. Wernsing, its president, and Dr. L.T. Smithson, director of professional services, and the ACA Executive Board of Governors. The California group magnanimously agreed to change their name to the American Chiropractic Society and also to encourage the development of the new ACA. Dr. E.G. Napolitano, representing the Columbia Institute of Chiropractic, New York City, attended the meetings of the ACACouncil on Education. The college has made application for ACA accreditation and has completed the self evaluation forms, a preliminary requirement to inspection by the ACA Committee of Accreditation. A proposed state affiliation agreement was adopted and the contracts are now available to interested and eligible state associations. ACA approval of contracts will be made at the Denver convention. -\"Special Release: ICA clarifies dual accreditation policy\" (p. 46): DAVENPORT, IOWA (ACP) - Responding to inquiries concerning the disallowance of dual accreditation of colleges by ICA and other organizations having a scope of practice inconsistent with that of ICA, Dr. John Q. Thaxton, President, stated early this month that he is hopeful dual or joint accreditation may become possible in the near future as a result of ACA's adopting the ICA scope of practice. \"Nothing in chiropractic history would go so far in solving the problems of the profession,\" he said. Dr. Thaxton pointed to the fact that Columbia Institute of Chiropractic, which is accredited by ICA, has recently made application for accreditation by ACA. If ACA should adopt the ICA scope of practice prior to acting favorably on Columbia's application, there would be no conflict in the dual accreditation. Columbia Institute of Chiropractic is in good standing as an ICA accredited college at the present time (March 13, 1964), and is entitled to all the rights and privileges of the ICA program. \"The proposed ACA scope of practice, which is apparently being promoted by such organization at present, is unacceptable to the ICA,\" Dr. Thaxton said. \"It is the consensus of the ICA Board that no ICA college should lend its prestige to such organization until an acceptable chiropractic definition and scope of practice are adopted.\" 1964 (May/June): Digest of Chiropractic Economics [6(6)] includes: -Ted (pp. 4-5); includes: NEW YORK Representatives of both ACA and FACE met with officials of Columbia Institute of Chiropractic and the Chiropractic Institute of New York regarding formation of one Regional College to serve the entire Eastern seaboard.

After several months of consultation between the officials of the Columbia Institute of Chiropractic of New York City and the Atlantic States Chiropractic Institute of Brooklyn, an agreement to consolidate both institutions was signed on September 21, 1964. Under the terms of the merger, the surviving institution shall be the Columbia Institute of Chiropractic. All Atlantic States students have been advised to report to classes at the Columbia Institute ofChiropractic at the start of the Fall semester on Monday, September 28, 1964. It is expected that the total enrollment at Columbia will exceed 400 students. Dr. Ernest G. Napolitano shall be president of the merged institutions; Dr. Martin I. Phillips, Dean Emeritus of the Department of Chiropractic Technique; Dr. N. Robert Limber, Vice President Emeritus. It is essential that although the Columbia Institute of Chiropractic survives under the consolidation agreement, the effect of the merger is to bring about a true blending of the two institutions so as to retain and stimulate the support of the Alumni of both institutions. Keeping abreast of the ever-expanding student body, the Board of Trustees of Columbia approved an extensive expansion program of their physical plant. A new Technique classroom equipped with modern adjusting tables, an additional Chemistry laboratory and two new lecture halls will be completed in time for the start of the Fall '64 semester. In addition, the Trustees have authorized the purchase of a four- story building directly across the street from Columbia's existing facilities. This new unit will house a modern out-patient Clinic on the first level. The entire second story will be used as a library containing more than 10,000 volumes. The third and fourth floors will be utilized for additional classrooms to accommodate future enrollments. The curriculum offered at Columbia, includes a bedrock foundation in the Chiropractic subjects with continued emphasis upon the Philosophy, Science and Art of Chiropractic. Columbia's various Faculty Committees are constantly alert to the importance of integrating Chiropractic in all phases of the curriculum. The Chiropractic and Basic Science subjects are offered by a highly mature qualified Faculty staff. Dr. Napolitano, President of Columbia, expressed deep appreciation to Dr. Charles Krasner, President of the Chiropractic Association of New York, for his participation at the various conferences that led to a final consolidation agreement. He further indicated his wholehearted support of the American Chiropractic Association's resolution to establish an Eastern Seaboard Regional College. Dr. Napolitano emphasized that the Board of Trustees of Columbia will cooperate in every respect with any reasonable program that will lead to the establishment of one outstanding educational center in New York State. -J.

He developed the first systematized method for x- raying multithickness specimens which was published as an article in Industrial Radiography and issued as a reprint for world-wide distribution by the Picker X-Ray Corp. During the Korean War, Dr. Allen served as a Captain in the Medical Service Corps and was Chief of Serology, Bacteriology and Parasitology for the Eighth Army which included all of Korea. While in Korea Dr. Allen isolated a new bacterial strain from Chinese prisoners of war, a citrate positive Shigelli, which was named after him. Correspondence should be addressed to Dr. Allen at 460 N. Potomac St., Hagerstown, Md. -\"College reports: Columbia Institute\" (p. 29): Beginning with the September class, Columbia Institute of Chiropractic has discontinued its evening school, according to an announcement by Dr. Ernest G. Napolitano. The decision was made after long consultation by faculty members with leading educators and was based on the new Chiropractic Act in the State of New York, which requires that after Jan. 1, 1968, all candidates for the Chiropractic Board must have two years of college work before entering Chiropractic College. Dr. Napolitano pointed out that a student who wished to enter night classes at Columbia Institute this fall would have had to complete all course work before Jan. 1, 1968 - requiring 36 consecutive months,with at least six periods of instruction each evening for five evenings a week with summer intersessions. \"The jeopardy to the student, in the opinion of our staff, is too great,\" Dr. Napolitano said. High school graduates for the day session are being accepted for the last time this fall at Columbia. Hereafter candidates will have to have two years of college to enter. Columbia has expanded its facilities this year - including a new technique classroom measuring 18 by 75 feet, a 18-foot-by -75-foot laboratory and two lecture halls. The four-story building across the street from the Institute has been purchased and will house a completely modern out-patient clinic on the first floor. The second floor will house a library of more than 10,000 volumes. The third and fourth floors will provide more classrooms to accommodate future enrollments. Columbia College sponsored a regional seminar at the Hotel Roosevelt in New York Aug. 29-30. It featured J. Joseph Allen, B.S., M.S., Ph.D., D.C., member of the Columbia faculty, lecturing on X- ray techniques and problems. 1964 (Nov): ACA Journal of Chiropractic [1(11)] includes: -\"Columbia and Atlantic States Colleges merge; Consolidation of both institutions achieved on September 21, 1964\" (p. 24); includes photograph & text: Participating in the formalities of the merger of Atlantic States and Columbia Institute of Chiropractic were (stand, l. to r.) - Mr. Anthony Aragona, counsel for Columbia Institute of Chiropractic; Dr. Charles Krasner, president of Chiropractic Association of New York; Dr. Ernest G.

Dr. Napolitano, president of Columbia, expresses deep appreciation to Dr. Charles Krasner, president of the Chiropractic Association of New York, for his participation at the various conferences that led to a final consolidation agreement. He further indicated his wholehearted support of the American Chiropractic Association's resolution to establish an eastern seaboard regional college. Dr. Napolitano emphasized that the Board of Trustees of Columbia will cooperate in every respect with any reasonable program that will lead to the establishment of one outstanding chiropractic educational center in New York State. -\"New York: Academy honors schools and graduates\" (p. 36) 1964 (Nov/Dec): Digest of -\"College reports: Columbia Inst.\" (pp. 29-30): September, 1964 will long be remembered by Chiropractors in New York State and throughout the country. In the best interest of the profession, the consolidation of the Atlantic States Chiropractic Institute with the Columbia Institute of Chiropractic was consummated. Columbia enjoyed the largest freshman enrollment since its inception. Ninety-seven new students have matriculated for the Fall semester. The total enrollment as of this writing is 347 undergraduates. Additional facilities have been established for the convenience of our students and to implement our curriculum. The second examination, as prescribed in the Chiropractic Act that became effective July 1, 1963, will be offered during the week of December 14, 1964. Columbia is sponsoring Review Courses in Chiropractic Practice, Use & Effects of X-ray and all of the Basic Science subjects in New York City and Buffalo, New York. Courses in Anatomy, Physiology, X-ray and Chiropractic Practice are being conducted in the Albany are. This review is being presented as a service to the Chiropractic profession. All Doctors of Chiropractic were invited to attend. There was no tuition fee charged. Our entire staff appreciates the responsibility that they have to the profession and are doing everything possible to satisfy the need that exists for a competent and comprehensive review. 1964: United Jewish Appeal honors Napolitano (Columbia, 1969) 1964: Napolitano resigns from ICA Board of Control and seeks accreditation from ACA Council on Education (Dr. Napolitano, 1964) 1964 (Mar 6): letter from Clarence W. Weiant DC, PhD to Stanley Hayes DC: Dear Dr. Hayes:...As for the schools, the Atlantic States, very deservedly, is rapidly withering away and will not need be considered in planning for the future. The ACA is quite insistent upon an amalgamation of C.I.N.Y. and Columbia Institute, so that there will only be one strong school on the Eastern seaboard. This is now the subject of delicate negotiations made difficult by the untrustworthy, slippery nature of Columbia's head Dr. Napolitano. Dewey Anderson acts as the intermediary between the two schools. If there is to be an amalgamation, Dr. Peterson will insist upon retaining all members of the CINY staff and will tolerate no lowering of our present standards. He enjoys the confidence of the State Dept. of Education and will certainly do nothing to jeopardize it. In fact, the Dept is collaborating with him in the preparation of a provisional state charter which would, among other things, authorize the Institute to confer degrees. (Up to now this has been done under an out-of-state charter, by mail only.) To achieve permanent approval we are going to have to have probably a million-dollar building and considerable more in the way of financial reserves than we now possess. If a merger can be effected, we will of course be in a far stronger position to ask assistance from foundations, as well as the field. All state delegates from Maine to Florida would be rounded up to consider what is involved and, we would hope, to act as a committee to manage a fund drive. That is enough to make you realize how much is at stake in salvaging the right kind of ACA, if that is at all possible. So please, please, lay off, not in making valid criticisms and pressing for reform, but in striking what might be a body blow before even the gestation period is over. Praise and encourage those who intend to shape the ACA along effective and democratic lines. Then wait and see! Intensely yours,... 1964 (Aug 29): letter from Clarence W. Weiant DC, PhD at 809 Terrace Place, Peekskill NY to Stanley Hayes DC: Dear Dr. Hayes: ... We have been politely informed that we are to get no help from FACE for the year 1964-65 until substantial progress has been made toward amalgamation of the schools. Last year we received $14,000 (though the $7000 for the spring term did not come through until a couple of weeks ago!). This money was earmarked for faculty salary increments. Without it we are in imminent danger of losing two valued faculty members who have just earned academic degrees under previous grants from FACE. I did not go to Denver, but it has been reported to me that, in one of the school council sessions, Cecil Martin and Dewey Anderson made some such statement as this: \"Under the kind of law they have in New York, chiropractic education in that state is finished, and so there is no sense in pouring any money into that state for schools.\" This view won out in the deliberations. Such a defeatist attitude is incomprehensivle. There are no facts to support it. The New York State Department of Education is one of the strongest and most influential in the country. It prides itself on its high standards. By law it is responsible for the quality of professional education and for licensure, and this carries over into the chiropractic situation. The Board of Examiners has established excellent rapport with the Department of Education as a whole, right up to the Commissioner himself, who has had Dr. Krasner, President of the State Chiropractic Association, as a weekend guest at his home. Relations between the chiropractic and non-chiropractic members of the Board are very cordial. Both the medical man and the osteopath have been extremely helpful. The osteopath says over and over again, \"You people must stick to your principles. Don't let yourselves get sold out to the medics as we were.\" The M.D. member has visited our school and expressed amazement at what is taught in a chiropractic school and how it is taught. Both he and Dr. Mosher are fastlearning what chiropractic is all about, and they are extremely interested in seeing the profession progress. Until a few weeks ago things were at a standstill, because a small dissident group were testing the constitutionality of the chiropractic law in the courts. This group lost out successively in the Supreme Court, the Appelate Division, and the Court of Appeals. Still undaunted they carried the matter to the U.S. Supreme Court, which refused to consider it. That left the Dept. of Education free to grade the papers and begin issuing licenses, after which they will go ahead with plans for the future. They are frank to admit that they made a big mistake with the first examinations in the basic sciences, when theyhired a professional examination service to prepare the questions. Nobody at all saw the questions until they were opened up for use. This was because they were so sensitive on security measures. The Secretary of the Board of Medical Examiners passed the questions on to friends of his a couple of years ago, and the Regents are still smarting form the ensuing scandal. They made sure that nothing like that would happen again. But their procedure in this instance produced tests that were grossly unfair. Though the Department of Education does not say so publicly, they have admitted privately to being greatly embarrassed, and I am sure they will bend over backwards to find methods of grading the papers that will yield passable grades. In the future they intend to obtain specimen exams from all the basic science boards in the country and use these as a model for the exams they will give. I can say positively that everybody in the Dept. of Education from the Commissioner on down who is in any way involved with us wants to create both the atmosphere and the mechanisms for the maximum development of the profession in the state. In our peculiar New York State set-up legal recognition under the Education Dept. is tantamount to their seal of approval, and such a situation makes it incumbent upon them to give the best possible public image of what they have approved. I am sure that if this picture could be conveyed to the ACA Board of Directors, they would not be so ready to write off New York. To get the message across is not easy. There are many subtleties to be observed. We cannot embarrass people in the Dept. of Education by making open statements that they as individuals are our friends. We cannot openly be very specific about the reasons why school amalgamation cannot quickly be achieved. (More on that in a moment.) What can and should be distressed is that for the first time in chiropractic history chiropractic has been incorporated into the publication education system of a state, and if we play our role smartly, there is no telling how far we may get. You can contribute handsomely to this objective by exerting the right pressure in the right places. I might add parenthetically that, on a smaller scale, we have the same problem within the profession in the State of New York as exists on the national front. The full significance of our local situation has not seeped into the heads of the rank and file, and they tend to be pessimistic, apathetic, or hostile, though I think it is safe to say that at least a majority feel that we are definitely better off than before. Now I get back to the question of amalgamation. In principle nobody could object. Undoubtedly ACA officials consider such a step exceedingly desirable and look forward to its realization as a big feather in the ACA cap. But actually the whole business is premature. No school as yet has a charter. No school has been officially inspected by the Education Dept. We have received no bill of particulars setting forth what we must do to obtain even a provisional charter. As far as the Chiropractic Institute of New York is concerned, we feel that, on the basis of our facilities, the quality of our faculty, and the type of management followed - not to speak of the help we have been able to provide the Education Dept. in setting up the machinery for examination and licensure - we are in a far stronger position toward obtaining a charter than any other school, and we aremost anxious to avoid any premature amalgamation which might result in dilution of our standards. I think I told you in a previous letter that we had discovered an ACA scheme to push through amalgamation, making Napolitano president of the new institution. He heads the Columbia Institute. Not one member of our faculty could be persuaded to work under this man. Dr. Frank Dean, the founder of Columbia, was a man of high calibre, intellectually and morally. I would say that under him the school was certainly one of the best of the non-NCA-accredited schools. Since his death the school has deteriorated academically, though the physical plant has been improved. The ACA lost no time putting it on the approved list. (By the way, I understand that the Logan College representative was seated in the Council on Education before his school had even been inspected.) What price UNITY! Napolitano, for a considerable period, was Dean of the Atlantic States Institute, under the presidency of Martin Phillips, a man who was fired from C.I.N.Y. soon after it got going. He is a man who displays phony M.D., D.O., and D.Sc. diplomas. He has on various occasions secured honorary Doctor of Science degrees for his friends from a \"university\" in Atlanta which consists only of a small office that cloisters an ex-clergyman of some sort who makes his living by dispensing such documents. (I am speaking of Phillips.) Phillips' limited popularity in the field is maintained largely through his demonstrations of a wide variety of technics of dubious value and scientific basis. He and his cohorts appear to have some sort of hook- up with local Brooklyn politicans who have managed to keep him free from the law. Napolitano certainly was aware of how the Atlantic States was run. They have taken in students who flunked out of C.I.N.Y. without any such formality as demanding transcripts. One of them, the daughter of a chiropractor, had to leave us after being caught cribbing in exams three times. She joined the faculty after graduation from Atlantic States! Whether Napolitano left Atlantic States because he got fed up with such practices, or whether he just saw a chance to advance himself, I don't know, but after Dr. Dean's death he worked his way into the good graces of Dean's widow, Dr. Welch, and soon became Columbia Institute's king-man. Right up until the passage of our law, he opposed the NCA and fought with the ICA to defeat our bill. For this he has been rewarded with approval by ACA. That bit of irony certainly goes against the grain of the majority of the chiropractors in the state. His faculty is so changeable that the names do not appear in the catalog of the school. A separate list is sent out from time to time. Some of the members are recent graduates of his with no experience either in chiropractic or in teaching, who read their lectures, interspersing them with dirty jokes. He has tried to lure away from us some of our facutly members with the enticement of salaries we can not afford, but they have remained loyal to us. His school \"library\" would be more appropriately designated as a small collection of books. By virtue of a big practice and various business interests he does have money to throw around. Now you can understand why we are not exactly ready to rush into amalgamation. If I go on much longer, I will probably ruin your day. I am eager to hear your reaction. On Wednesday we are taking off for Cape Cod for a ten day vacation. If you find time to drop me a line, it would make me very happy. Send it to Harbor Breeze Village, Lower County Road, Harwich Port, Mass. Sincerely,... P.S. I am sure you will handle this information with discretion. 1964 (Sept 21): CIC and ASCI of Brooklyn merge (Columbia, 1964a&b; Official, 1993) 1964 (Sept/Oct): Digest of Chiropractic Economics notes: -\"COLUMBIA and ATLANTIC STATES COLLEGES MERGE\" (p. 9):A new milestone has been achieved in New York State. After several months of consultation between the officials of the Columbia Institute of Chiropractic of New York City and the Atlantic States Chiropractic Institute of Brooklyn, an agreement to consolidate both institutions was signed on September 21, 1964. Under the terms of the merger, the surviving institution shall be the Columbia Institute of Chiropractic. All Atlantic States students have been advised to report to classes at the Columbia Institute of Chiropractic at the start of the Fall semester on Monday, September 28, 1964. It is expected that the total enrollment at Columbia will exceed 400 students. Dr. Ernest G. Napolitano shall be president of the merged institutions; Dr. Martin I. Phillips, Dean Emeritus of the Department of Chiropractic Technique; Dr. N. Robert Limber, Vice President Emeritus. It is essential that although the Columbia Institute of Chiropractic survives under the consolidation agreement, the effect of the merger is to bring about a true blending of the two institutions so as to retain and stimulate the support of the Alumni of both institutions. Keeping abreast of the ever-expanding student body, the Board of Trustees of Columbia approved an extensive expansion program of their physical plant. A new Technique classroom equipped with modern adjusting tables, an additional Chemistry laboratory and two new lecture halls will be completed in time for the start of the Fall '64 semester. In addition, the Trustees have authorized the purchase of a four- story building directly across the street from Columbia's existing facilities. This new unit will house a modern out-patient Clinic on the first level. The entire second story will be used as a library containing more than 10,000 volumes. The third and fourth floors will be utilized for additional classrooms to accommodate future enrollments. The curriculum offered at Columbia, includes a bedrock foundation in the Chiropractic subjects with continued emphasis upon the Philosophy, Science and Art of Chiropractic. Columbia's various Faculty Committees are constantly alert to the importance of integrating Chiropractic in all phases of the curriculum. The Chiropractic and Basic Science subjects are offered by a highly mature qualified Faculty staff. Dr. Napolitano, President of Columbia, expressed deep appreciation to Dr. Charles Krasner, President of the Chiropractic Association of New York, for his participation at the various conferences that led to a final consolidation agreement. He further indicated his wholehearted support of the American Chiropractic Association's resolution to establish an Eastern Seaboard Regional College.

Peterson DC (p. 8): Editor's note: The folloiwng article is a joint stement by the Presidents of the Chiropractic Institute of New York and the Columbia Institute of Chiropractic. --- It has long been acknowledge that a single strong school of chiropractic in the State and City of New York is an ultimate goal for the advancment of the educational structure for the entire profession. At Des Moines, Iowa last month, where the American Chiropractic Association, its Council on Education, Board of Governors, and Trustees of the Foundation for Accredited Chiropractic Education held mid-year meetings, it was decided that an overall plan to support such a school should now be advanced. Discussions centered around a plan to institute a fund-raising project to provide one million dollars for the purchase or the building of an adequate physical plant for such a school, which would be eligible for a charter and registration by the State Education Department, and it is expected that the American Chiropractic Association will lend its financial support to the extent of more than one hundred thousand dollars on a matching basis. In view of this positive support, Dr. Thure C. Peterson, President of the Chiropractic Institute of New York, and Dr. Ernest G. Napolitano, President of the Columbia Institute of New York [sic] reached the decision that the time was now appropriate to discuss consolidation of the two schools. Talks were instituted in Des Moines which led to agreement on fundamental matters, and this was reported to the American Chiropractic Association. On Sunday, January 31, 1965, the faculty, trustees, and officers and directors of the Alumni Association of both schools were informed simultaneously of the new development, as was the student body the next day. Further discussions for exchange of pertinent information necessary to implement the consolidation will be held so that initial steps can be taken in the near future. It is evident that the chartering and registration of one fine school by the State Education Department of New York will be a giant step forward for the profession and will greatly enhance the acceptance of the Council on Education of the American Chiropractic Association by the Department of Health, Education and Welfare as the accrediting agency for the profession. The entire profession, especially along the Eastern Seaboard States, is urged to lend support to this constructive development.1965 (Mar/Apr): Digest of Chiropractic Economics [7(5)] includes: -\"National Ins.

Dr. Ernest G. Napolitano, President of Columbia, discussed the advantages of Chiropractic as a career. Mr. Harold Berkowitz, Consulting Psychologist at Columbia, reported on the student counseling program inaugurated September, 1964. Several films were projected. The final phase of the program included an extensive question and answer period. It is interesting to note that the majority of the counsellors in attendance were deeply interested in Chiropractic and desired career guidance information. This is the fourth meeting of this nature. Two of them were held prior to the September, 1964 enrollment. A study of our admissions applications indicated that 18 out of the 90 new candidates accepted for the Fall, 1964 class were directly referred by one of the career guidance counsellors attending previous Columbia meetings. The officers and faculty of Columbia are pleased to announce that the Chiropractic Square Club of New York #1057 will hold its regular meetings the last Tuesday of each month. We have provided a large lecture hall for these fine Doctors of Chiropractic to assemble. Dr. N. Robert Limber, Vice President Emeritus of Columbia, also serves as Vice President of this organization. Other officers are Doctors Harry Grabelsky, President; Maurice Schmier, Treasurer and Historian; Arthur Bender, Secretary, and G.M. Kasavis, Chaplain. The National Chiropractic Board was offered in New York City on March 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th. An encouraging number of candidates participated in the examinations. Dr. Ed Saunders, President, with all of his fine officers and members of the National Board, are to be commended. This is truly a constructive stepping stone for the advancement of Chiropractic. The officers of the June, 1965 graduating class announced their intention to present meritorious certificates to several of the outstanding Chiropractic associations, state as well as national, for their indefatigable efforts in promoting Chiropractic in their respective jurisdictions. 1965 (May/June): Digest of Chiropractic Economics [7(6)] includes: -J.

With the advent of universal insurance coverage, doctors of chiropractic are more frequently called upon to render opinions as to the type and extent of injuries, establish disability and to make reports of same. Court appearances are becoming more frequent and the doctor of chiropractic must be prepared with adequate office records to establish that he has followed the best standard of chiropractic practice.

Joseph Allen authors \"Neurological-physiological basis of coast may have new combined college\" (p. 54): Schenectady, N.Y. - The dreams of progressive chiropractors in New York State for a merging of present Chiropractic schools into one super-college in this city have been moved a step toward reality. Both the American Chiropractic Association and the International Chiropractic [sic] Association have taken initial steps toward establishment of a Chiropractic college in Schenectady under the name Eastern Seaboard Chiropractic College. The action consisted of applications to accept the Schenectady Industrial Development Council's offer of a college plant and 80 acres of campus facilities, with a reported value of $1,000,000. The Tri-County Chiropractic Society - with a membership in Schenectady, Albany and Troy - has been avidly promoting the establishment of a distinguished Chiropractic College on the Eastern seaboard to win recognition from both the State of New York and the Federal government. Final approval would be contingent upon the decision of the new board of trustees of the combined colleges. Serious proposals have been under consideration for the merger of the present Chiropractic Institute of New York and the Columbia Institute of Chiropractic into the Schenectady project. This would give a school more than 1,000 students. As members of the Tri-County Chiropractic Society said: \"This action would give us a superior, fully accredited, upgraded college of Chiropractic on the Eastern Seaboard. It would be a college with the dignity, decorum, prestige, campus atmosphere and facilities -worthy of an institution of higher learning. \"A college of such stature could command accreditation by all important Federal and State administrative bodies, including theOffice of Health, Education and Welfare and the new York State Department of Education.\" Various leading chiropractors in the New York City area have visited the proposed site and have been strongly impressed. Through procedures outlined by the S.I.D.C. it is considered possible that the campus site can be obtained gratis through a grant in aid from the H.E.W., following accreditation of the A.C.A. by the U.S. agency. The Tri-County Society has already pledged more than $70,000 toward the establishment of the college at Schenectady. The Chamber of Commerce of this city has promised to conduct a campaign for an additional $200,000 in funds for the college. Still another possibility which would add stature to the proposed college is a statement by the Dean of Faculty at Union University that a definite possibility exists that an affiliation could be arranged between the university and the new college. While recognizing there are many problems to be solved in the mergers of the already established New York Chiropractic schools, the Tri-County Chiropractic Society considers the action necessary to the future of Chiropractic in the state. Said a spokesman: \"The magnitude of this Schenectady project, with its existing ideal campus facilities and atmosphere, makes it imperative and of the most vital importance to insure the licensure of future practitioners and continue the unbroken lifeline of Chiropractic in the State of New York. The Tri-County group is conducting a statewide pledge campaign to obtain financial support for the project. -photograph and caption (p. 57): The Board of Trustees of the Columbia Institute of Chiropractic in New York City made available to Reverend Mother Leo M.

The medical representative attempted to discredit the entire chiropractic profession by using as ammunition, various text books and memoranda, some of which were more than fifty years out of date. Many of the medic's quotations were taken out of context. Speaking about the lack of official recognition in Louisiana, Dr. Allen pointed out that it was too bad that the second largest healing profession had to appeal at this point for recognition. He continued, \"It is contrary to all the rules of justice and fairness to allow a competitor (the medical profession) to pass on our ability.\" \"There is a law that supersedes man-made law and that is the moral law. People are going to chiropractors, millions of them and these millions are getting results.\" Asked following the luncheon, just what he as a chiropractor can do for a patient, Dr. Allen replied: \"The chiropractor claims to be an effective operator when mechanical displacements of the spine have a direct ancillary relationship to disease.\" 1966 (May/June): Digest of Chiropractic Economics [8(6)] includes: -Dr. J.

The talk expanded into an enlightening hour long dialogue. He was happy about the Massachusetts news. He was not happy about the recent refusal of the Supreme Court to further review the England case. Obviously the matter will be pursued further, and Mr. Simon, a brilliant and capable lawyer, explained the legal path that he now must take. Frankly, my field is science - not law - so I'll just say that I'm glad that he is on our side and whatever can be done - will be done. Mr. Simon had been kind enough to forward to me all the data on the England case to date - but I learned a lot more about the real battle that he has been waging. For instance, I was informed that the England case had not really brought up this whole matter - that had been done as far back as the early twenties when the Fife Brothers, chiropractors were involved. What the work of Mr. Simon is concerned with is the development by sound and intensive argumentation, based upon evidence brought before the courts that this matter of the right of chiropractors to practice is one that ought to be upheld if we are not to open the door for destructive legislation everywhere against this great and noble profession... -\"Dr. Saetta... president, Alumni Association\" (p. 62); includes photo of Dr. Saetta 1966 (Sept/Oct): Digest of Chiropractic Economics [9(2)] includes: N.Y.\" (p. 40); includes photo of Little League team sponsored by CIC -F.C.

September 27, 1966 late 1966?: undated letter on C.I.C. stationery from Napolitano and Columbia's chairman and vice-chairman of board of trustees (Cleveland papers, Cleveland Chiropractic College of Kansas City; in my NYCC file): Dear Doctor: Over the past two and a half years many meetings have been held between Columbia Institute of Chiropractic and the Chiropractic Institute of New York relative to a merger of these two schools into a new entity which would seek accreditation by the Department of Education of the State of New York.You have a right to know the status of these negotiations and what has been accomplished because, as a chiropractor, you have a stake in this profession, its schools, its students and, most important, its future. On August 3, 1966 the Board of Trustees of Columbia Institute of Chiropractic met and unanimously passed a resolution which was transmitted to the Board of Governors of the A.C.A. and to the Board of Trustees of the Chiropractic Institute of New York. This resolution said in part: \"...it is further unanimously agreed that expeditious action must be taken to meet the standards and requirements for registration and accreditation in the State of New York by the Columbia Institute of Chiropractic.\" The Board of Trustees of Columbia Institute of Chiropractic believes it is both vital and urgent that a school of chiropractic be accredited in New York State as soon as possible. While it would be ideal to merge the two schools and obtain accreditation for this new entity time is running out and merger has not been achieved. We must not delay any longer in seeking accreditation. Our responsibility to our students and to the chiropractic profession is crystal clear; we have no alternative at this time but to proceed to achieve accreditation. The door is still open for continued negotiation with the Chiropractic Institute of New York and it will continue to remain open but we must take this step now to protect our students and the profession. Attached to this letter is a \"White Paper\" which details the history of these merger negotiations. Also see Appendix \"A attached to the \"White Paper\" which is an official chronology of events from Dr. John fisher of the American Chiropractic Association. Please understand, there are no recriminations, no assigning of blame or fault, no brickbats. This \"White Paper\" is a simple statement of the facts leading up to the decision we have made. This is the first in a series of communications to the profession from this institution. There will be others. Respectfully submitted, Clifford Zoller, Chairman, Board of Trustees Joseph Krowitz, Vice-Chairman, Board of Trustees Ernest G. Napolitano, D.C., President -attached is \"A White Paper: A report to the chiropractic profession\" from Columbia Institute: INTRODUCTION At the present time there are two chiropractic colleges in New York City, each offering a four year course of study. These two schools are the Columbia Institute of Chiropractic and the Chiropractic Institute of New York. Each school is the result of merger and affiliation with other chiropractic schools over the years. With a history of merger in this city it was to be expected that the two schools, sooner or later, would enter into discussions having as their ultimate objective merger into one major school of chiropractic. This objective became particularly desirable and necessary with the advent of licensure in New York State and the need for a school that would be acceptable to and accredited by the Department of Education of the State of New York. Such a dialogue was started approximately 20 months ago by the two schools, although initial conversations were commenced earlier. These discussions continued until quite recently at which time they reached an impasse and came to a halt. Columbia Institute of Chiropractic has therefore determined that it has no alternative but to apply to the Department of Education of the State of New York for accreditation as a four year college of chiropractic. Here now is a chronology of the events leading to this decision. MERGER *February 1964, Dewey Anderson, then Chairman of the Department of Education of the A.C.A., recommended that Columbia Institute of Chiropractic suspend its expansion and fund raising plans and enter into negotiations with the Chiropractic Institute of New York. Object: Merger.*Following exploratory conversations, serious negotiations were entered into by Dr. Ernest G. Napolitano, representing Columbia Institute of Chiropractic, and Dr. Thure C. Peterson, representing the Chiropractic Institute of New York. *The Boards of Trustees of both institutions met individually and jointly. Committees from both Boards held meetings. Meetings were held with representatives from A.C.A. including Dr. John Fisher, currently Chairman of the Education Department of A.C.A., and Dr. Cecil Martin, then Chairman of the Board of Governors of the A.C.A *Well over 100 meetings to discuss merger have been held. *Meetings have been held during the day, at breakfast, at lunch, at dinner, over weekends. *Over the past 20 months, Columbia Institute of Chiropractic has devoted in excess of 5000 man-hours to meetings, discussions and negotiations, hopefully leading towards merger. *In January 1966 Dr. Peterson and Dr. Napolitano agreed to a plan of consolidation while at the A.C.A. mid-year meeting. They reported their agreement to the Board of Governors of the A.C.A. *Three weeks later, Dr. Peterson submitted his resignation as President of the Chiropractic Institute of New York bringing negotiations to a halt. *In June 1966 a series of proposals for merger were submitted by Dr. O.B. Inman, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the A.C.A., which were completely acceptable to the Board of Trustees of the Columbia Institute of Chiropractic. *Information received from Dr. Inman indicated that the Chiropractic Institute of New York also stated these proposals were equally acceptable to their Board of Trustees. *Based upon acceptance by both schools of the June 5th proposals, A.C.A. attorneys prepared a legal agreement for both parties to sign at the A.C.A. convention in Los Angeles. Dr. Napolitano attended that Convention with a power-of-attorney from the Board of Trustees which empowered him to be the signatory for the school. *The Chiropractic Institute of New York would not sign the agreement. *The proposals of June 5th recommended a twelve-man Board of Trustees consisting of six from Columbia Institute of Chiropractic, three from the Chiropractic Institute of New York, and three from the A.C.A. *Dr. Napolitano stated to representatives of the A.C.A. and the Chiropractic Institute of New York that the three A.C.A. representatives to the proposed twelve-man Board could be selected by the Chiropractic Institute of New York. *Columbia Institute of Chiropractic's net assets total more than $227,000 based upon an audit made by a firm of Certified Public Accountants. The real estate, buildings and improvements alone are computed at $225,000. *It is a fact that Dr. Napolitano has never received any salary from Columbia Institute of Chiropractic since he ascended to its presidency in 1959. THE ROLE OF COLUMBIA INSTITUTE OF CHIROPRACTIC IN PREPARING THE PROFESSION IN NEW YORK STATE FOR LICENSING EXAMINATIONS *Licensure became an accomplished fact in New York State in 1963. In May 1963 the Chiropractic Association of New York, Inc. suggested individually to both schools that a joint effort be made to offer the profession refresher courses preparatory to examinations. *The Chiropractic Association of New York, Inc. was unable to accomplish this and each school offered its own series of refresher courses. *Columbia Institute of Chiropractic offered courses upstate and downstate from June 1963 to January 1964 at a nominal cost, so low that the school lost money. *The first examination was given in April 1964. *The second examination was given in December 1964. *Columbia Institute of Chiropractic offered a second series of refresher courses upstate and downstate from September 1964 toNovember 1964. There was no fee charged for this series. The faculty worked without fee as well. *Dr. Napolitano met with Dr. Peterson in an effort to arrange a joint teaching effort for the benefit of the profession, to no avail. *Dr. Peterson stated that the faculty of the Chiropractic Institute of New York was a unique team and could not work with any other group or body. *Future refresher courses to be given by Columbia Institute of Chiropractic in preparation for licensing examinations will be subsidized by the school with a nominal fee being charged. *In the successful fight for licensure in Massachusetts, Dr. Joseph Allen of the Faculty of Columbia Institute of Chiropractic made many visits to Boston to speak in behalf of the chiropractic profession before legislators and legislative committees. *Dr. Napolitano appeared before legislative committees of the Massachusetts legislature in the fight for licensure in that state. *The full services of Columbia Institute of Chiropractic have been offered Massachusetts chiropractors for refresher courses in preparation for licensing examinations to be given shortly in that state. COLUMBIA INSTITUTE OF CHIROPRACTIC THE SCHOOL *Columbia Institute of Chiropractic is the oldest accredited non-profit chiropractic institution in the East, founded in 1919. *The courses are patterned after the courses prescribed by the Council on Education of the American Chiropractic Association. The school is approved by the A.C.A. *Columbia Institute of Chiropractic is approved by Chiropractic and Basic Science Licensing Boards throughout the United States and Canada. *Columbia Institute of Chiropractic is approved by the Veterans Administration for training under P.L. 894 and 815. * Columbia Institute of Chiropractic is listed by the United States Department of State as an approved institution of learning for foreign students. *In 1959 a program of modernization and expansion was undertaken and two familiar brownstone buildings on West 71st Street, New York City, were converted at a cost of more than $90,000 into a modern college housing 8 classrooms, complete laboratories, clinic, library and executive offices. *In 1964 an additional capital investment was made with the expansion of facilities to include a new technique classroom, a new laboratory, and two new lecture halls. *The Board of Trustees authorized negotiations leading to the purchase of two four-story buildings directly across the street from the school. These new units will house a completely modern out- patient clinic, additional classrooms, and a library containing more than 10,000 volumes. *Such is the faith of Columbia Institute of Chiropractic in the chiropractic profession, in itself, and in the future that it is embarking upon an unprecedented expansion program. *One of the prerequisites for accreditation by the Department of Education of the State of New York is a net worth of $500,000. Columbia Institute of Chiropractic has the financial foundation to achieve this objective. It has pledged itself to raise the balance required, attain this long sought after goal and make a fully accredited four year college of chiropractic a reality on the Eastern Seaboard. * Columbia Institute of Chiropractic accepts its responsibility to protect and safeguard the future of its students and the profession in this state and in this region. As a member of the chiropractic profession you will be kept informed and advised of every step that has and will be taken in behalf of our profession. In return, we trust we may earn your respect, your concern and your cooperation.1966: Edwin H.

Unable to cope with the continued ineligibility of its modern graduates to practice in its home state, CINY's trustees considered a merger to be the only solution for preserving its heritage as well as providing its graduates with a legal repository for their records. In September of 1968 they chose NCC to be the official, legal trustee and curator of their institutional records, including those from the three that had amalgamated to form CINY in 1944 - Carver's New York Institute and the Cosmopolitan school. Dr. Earl G. Liss and Dr. Thure C. Peterson, Chairmen of the Boards of Trustees of NCC and CINY respectively, published a glowing account of the affiliation as a consolidation of strengths and traditions which represented a forward step of significance to the progressive future of the chiropractic profession (ACA Journal October 1968). Little did they know just how important the merger would become to the perpetuation of chiropractic in the state of New York as well as a boon to chiropractic's educational sector in general. CINY's \"adopted\" sons and daughters would gain immediate representation on both NCC's college and alumni boards. This further stimulated many CINY graduates to provide transfer students and send more than one hundred matriculants per year as well as money and moral support for National's growth and development. They encouraged NCC to persist in its already vigorous pursuit of accreditation through registration with the Board of Regents of the State Education Department of the University of the State of New York. In 1971 NCC became the first, and for seven years the only, chiropractic institution in the world to be accredted by New York State. 1968 (Sept/Oct): Digest of Chiropractic Economics [11(2)] includes: -J.

Liss, DC, Chairman, Board of Trustees of National College and Thure C. Peterson DC, Chairman of the Board of Trustees of CINY (p. 8) C.I.N.Y. and N.C.C. Affiliation Program After extended forthright deliberations between appointed representatives of the ACA Board of Governors, the Foundation for Chiropractic Education and Research, the Chiropractic Institute of New York and its alumni, and the National College of Chiropractic and its alumni, the C.I.N.Y. requested approval to discontinue its undergraduate school and asked to affiliate its facilities, its alumni and reposit its vital records with the National College. This decision embraces the consolidating of the traditions and historical emphasis of two college families that have constantly through the years stood in support of the educational and professional programs initiated and sponsored by first the NCA and later the ACA, and which have come to mean so much to all of us and to represent the progressive future of the chiropractic profession. This bringing together of the two alumni groups represents a great promise for future support of our profession's educational program. By discontinuing the undergraduate program of the C.I.N.Y. and the consolidating of alumni effort, nothing has been lost and much has been gained. Thus we take pride in making this joint announcement and express the conviction that it augers well for the future.The accommodation effected through the affiliation of the C.I.N.Y. with the National College is the consummation of delibertions conducted in honest, open counsel by representatives of all parties concerned. Representation on the N.C.C. college and alumni boards is being considered and structured. We therefore encourage unqualified recognition and support of this historical conclusion as a forward step of significance in our profession. We are mutually aware that this decision engenders great responsibilities. We acknowledge our appreciation to the ACA Board of Governors and the Trustees of FCER for their council [sic] and assistance in formulating the consolidating program that is now under negotiation. The college families we represent are committed to the programs and policies of the ACA and the relating Council on Education and Accrediting Agency. -college accreditation listing: (p. 24) College of Chiropractic (Rehm, 1980, pp. 298-9): In 1968, the Chiropractic Institute of New York was merged with the National College of Chiropractic, Chicago, thus continuing the educational tradition Dr. Craig Kightlinger established in 1919 with the founding of the Eastern Chiropractic College. 1968: according to Smallie (1990, p. 28): Chiropractic Institute of New York and Detroit College affiliate with National College. 1968: according to Schierholz (1986, p. 26): CINY Merger to NCC Almost without exception, chiropractic colleges overcame adversities, but occasionally the effort to continue was too great. Such was the case with the Chiropractic Institute of New York which was in a state of financial chaos. The Trustees decided that it was important to keep CINY from going bankrupt so the image of chiropractic would not be tarnished in New York and across the nation. It was even more important that the accreditation program should not be affected. The Foundation for Chiropactic Education and Research assumed financial responsibility to merge and move the Chiropractic Institute to National College of Chiropractic, which now was located on its campus at Lombard, Illinois, just west of Chicago. FCER paid the outstanding bills including the transfer of official documents, records, the library, physical equipment and transfer of those students who wished to enroll at National. The total expenditure for this effort fell just short of $30,000. All physical assets of the Institute became the property of the Foundation. The National College was given priority on requisitions to acquire physical property including two copies of everything with historical significance in the CINY library. Four other colleges: Northwestern, Texas, Lincoln and Los Angeles, received some of the physical assets. The remainder was sold with the proceeds going to the National College for the purchase of bookshelves to accommodate the additional books. This was a major endeavor with FCER expressing gratitude to Dr. Janse and staff at National College for transfer of the physical property. 1969 (Jan/Feb): Digest of Chiropractic Economics [11(4)] includes: -\"Consultation at day's (p. 49) includes photograph & caption: CONSULTATION: At day's end, records are reviewed and discussed by the staff.

I have been informed by totally reliable individuals, which I am certain the publishing house will confirm, that 125,000 copies of the paper back edition have been ordered by an obvious source. The break-even point in an instance like this is 25,000 copies sold. By that I mean that when this figure is sold the company has to break even on the publication. Now the paperback edition is to be issued at the same time as the hardcover edition; evidence that either the publishers have written off any profit on the hardcover edition or that it is being subsidized by advance bulk orders from the aforementioned obvious quarters. This means that distribution for at least 100,000 books will be channeled for maximum effect to that segment of the population which one might call - the opinion formers. The impact will be considerable. I must point out that I am not one who holds that all who criticize this profession are evilly motivated or biased. Mr. Smith has written much that should have been written by the national associations within the profession. He has denounced much that should have been denounced a long time ago by these same associations. His work is brutal, but not impregnable. Already a brilliant writer in another field, a valued friend, has started a critical analysis which will help put the whole matter in proper perspective. Naturally I shall have much to say in future articles. Mr. Smith has written a book that should be quite helpful in many ways. It brings into sharp focus much that has been foolishly tolerated with a benign attitude in the past, when it should have been vigorously condemned. Now the profession faces an agonizing decision - it must reject the unethical and unscientific or it must forfeit its demand for equal status within the scientific community. This will surely involve a strong reorientation toward those professional values that most practitioners in this discipline have strongly desired and which others, like this writer, have insisted are imperative. The future direction of the profession must be clearly stated; firm stands must be taken. What is true must be conceded; what is wrong must be corrected. False and improper analogies must be exposed. The good must be dramatically presented just as has been the case in metamorphosis of the medical profession from its early nadir to its present zenith. Mr. Smith does not do justice to those within the profession who have urged reform before he so dramatically unilaterally presented the negative facts. As recently as June of this year at the convention in Cincinnati I stated flatly to one of the authors of the book on infection, that it was trash, too ridiculous for serious consideration by anyone born above the condition of an idiot. And obviously, references to therapeutic absurdities such as skull molding for the treatment of cerebral palsy cause one to wince in shame when they are held out to be valid forms of treatment by a large chiropractic institution. Chiropractic theory is not structured even remotely on such incredibly stupid concepts. If it were, it would rightly stand condemnation. Mr. Smith has seen, so it would seem, only one side of the coin... 1969 (Nov/Dec): Digest of Chiropractic Economics [12(3)] includes: -full page ad for Clinic Masters of Colorado Springs CO (p. 21); many testimonials, including Richard right: 1) C.I.C.

Wishner, Associate Professor of Anatomy, and Director of the Henry Higley Memorial Bio-Structural Laboratory of Columbia Institute, reported that they had recently dedicated its new bio-structural research laboratory in honor of Dr. Higley, former Director of Research for the American Chiropractic Association, who passed away on May 18, 1969. Dr. Wishner said, \"We began early this year to investigate husbandry and conditioning techniques using over 50 gerbils, rats and hamsters. Our plan is to introduce various environmental stress factors such as increased G forces, noise, air pollutants and deficient diets to determine their effects on the Central Nervous System and Musculoskeletal System.\" \"To do this requires trained animal investigators as well as sophisticated x-ray and chemistry equipment. All of these items are very expensive. Our projected budget over the next three years is approximately $57,230.\" \"Don't be too shocked. We don't think that all of this has to come from the chiropractic profession, although it would be very nice. We are in the process of preparing proposals to the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, NASA, AEC, Office of Naval Research, National Science Foundation and the American Chiropractic Association. All government agencies have been trimming their budgets so I feel that before we can solicit their aid we must have something to show them. We have made a start. The Columbia Institute of Chiropractic has made an initial outlay of several thousand dollars and we have constructed much of our own equipment such as an oscilloscope, FM transmitter and receiver, etc. There is much more that we need before we can begin to collect data.\" \"The chiropractic profession has been severely criticized in the HEW report to the Congress on Medicaid and Medicare,\" Dr. Wishner continued \"as not being scientific. Here is our first real opportunity to get a meaningful research program started. Our first intention is to build a laminar flow room with controlled temperature and humidity. As funds are made available we would like to add more cages and animals. EEG and EMG, stereotaxic and angiography, isotope scanning apparatus as well as storage and retrieval of our data through electronic data processing.\"\"We are functioning and anxious to more our projects along. All comments, suggestions, assistance and contributions are welcome. If you are in a high income tax bracket and the government demands more why not make a contribution to the advancement of chiropractic instead. Your contributions are all tax deductible. Please feel free to offer any or all of the above requested items as soon as possible,\" Dr. Wishner concluded. Regional Seminars featuring Dr. Walter V. Pierce and Glenn Stillwagon under the direction of Columbia's Administrative Dean, Dr. Thomas L. Whitehorne, will be conducted in Boston, Massachusetts; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Denver, Colorado; Manchester, New Hampshire; and Miami, Florida. The first of this series of Seminars was conducted on-campus December 20 and 21. This phase of Continuing Education provides emphasis in the use of Chiropractic Instrumentation, primarily the Derma Therm-o-graph, as well as Chiropractic Technic related to the Terminal Point Adjusting Table. The response of doctors attending the December 20 and 21 Seminar was enthusiastic and, for the most part, the reason for broadening the off-campus regional presentations of this work. Exact dates and locations will be announced by the early part of February. Doctors desiring additional information are respectfully requested to write to Dr. Thomas L. Whitehorne, Administrative Dean. By unanimous action of the Executive Committee, Dr. Thomas L. Whitehorne was appointed Administrative Dean of the Columbia Institute of Chiropractic effective October 1, 1969. Dr. Whitehorne is a graduate of the Palmer College of Chiropractic and for more than twenty-five years has been engaged in successful active practice. He served on the faculty of the Atlantic States Chiropractic Institute for many years. President Napolitano in making the appointment stated that Dr. Whitehorne's background, experience and dedication to chiropractic will indeed be a stepping stone to greater progress for this institution. Drs. Walter V. Pierce and Glenn Stillwagon were appointed to the ranks of Professor in the Department of Chiropractic Instrumentation. The 1969-70 Alumni Directory has been completed and will be mailed to all graduates of Columbia Institute of Chiropractic, Columbia College of Chiropractic, Atlantic States Chiropractic Institute and Associate Members. The 1969-70 Membership Directory of the Beta Omega Chi Chiropractic Fraternity (Alpha Chapter CIC) was completed and distributed to Active and Honorary Members. 1970 (Mar): ACA Journal of Chiropractic [7(3)] includes: -Frederick Wishner, D.C. authors \"Columbia Institute of Chiropractic laboratory dedicated to Dr. Henry Higley\" (pp. 12-3); includes: Historical Background In back of the author's mind for several years has been the desire to do pure basic science research into the cause and effect of the subluxation. After a conference with Dr. Ernest G. Napolitano, president of the Columbia Institute of Chiropractic, it was decided in January 1969 that the Columbia Institute would underwrite a research program using live animals and, accordingly, several thousand dollars were appropriated for that purpose. With this donation, animals, cages, food, bedding, racks, tables, and miscellaneous equipment were purchased; and suitable facilities on campus are being used to house them. The research project commenced in April 1969. Since that time an oscilloscope, 16 mm. camera, a fish tank, pH meter, and binocular microscope have been added. We are also in the process of checking out an FM transmitter and receiver for use in telemetry of electromyograph signals. The laboratory was officially dedicated in honor of the late Dr. Henry Higley, director of research for the American Chiropractic Association. Dr. Higley was truly a man of science...1970 (Mar/Apr): Digest of Chiropractic Economics [12(5)] includes: -full page ad for Clinic Mastersof Colorado Springs CO (p. 27) -\"Logan College and Columbia withdraw from the Council on Education of the American Chiropractic Association\" (centerfold, pp. 33A-36A); includes: STATEMENT OF POLICY AN ACCREDITING AGENCY REPREENTING CHIROPRACTIC COLLEGES ACCEPTABLE TO THE UNITED STATES OFFICE OF EDUCATION, A DIVISION OF H.E.W., IS ESSENTIAL FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF CHIROPRACTIC... LOGAN COLLEGE AND COLUMBIA WITHDRAW FROM THE COUNCIL ON EDUCATION OF THE AMERICAN CHIROPRACTIC ASSOCIATION As startling as this may seem, it is important to note that this decision for both colleges to withdraw from the Council on Education of the American Chiropractic Association is based on the following facts: 1. Logan College and Columbia joined the American Chiropractic Association and the Council on Education with the view in mind of supporting a national organization effort that would provide a united front representation for the chiropractic profession. This was done in good faith and in accordance with the policies and principles of both colleges. Regarding the principle of a single national organization representing our profession - both colleges remain firmly convinced that until that becomes a reality, confusion will reign high and the profession in toto will suffer. 2. Following several meetings with general educators, educational consultants and individuals intimately acquainted with the structure and function of an Accrediting Agency, the following was concluded: (a) The Accrediting Agency must be devoid of professional politics. (b) The Agency must be self sustaining and financially stable without dependence upon any political group. (c) The Agency should be made up of institutional administrators, field practitioners and general educators. (d) The individuals constituting the agency's Accrediting Commission should not be selected from politically motivated groups, organizations or councils. (e) Inasmuch as two national organizations exist - each having their own Accrediting Agency and each having submitted applications for approval of their respective agencies during the past several years (without success) - it was concluded that so long as there are two accrediting agencies related to political associations, the United States Office of Education, a division of H.E.W., would not serve as referee and, therefore, the chiropractic profession finds itself in the year of 1970 without a suitably acceptable chiropractic college Accrediting Agency approved by the U.S. Office of Education. 3. A chiropractic college (by Constitution and By-Laws of the Council on Education of the American Chiropractic Association) may not be affiliated with more than one chiropractic Accrediting Agency, Association, or Council... A PLAN FOR THE FUTURE Logan and Columbia colleges have joined with several other chiropractic colleges to form an Accrediting Association separate and apart from any political organization (a detailed official release from the new Association naming the participating colleges will be forthcoming)... -Walter V. Pierce, D.C. & Glenn Stillwagon, D.C. of NYCC author \"Charting and interpreting skin temperature patterns\" -\"College news: Columbia Institute of Chiropractic\" (p. 50): The Columbia Institute of Chiropractic has caused to have sponsored legislation to provide an opportunity for graduates of the majority of chiropractic colleges to practice in the State of New York. Included are those colleges which have previously made application for registration of their curriculum or charter, under the educationlaws of the State of New York, relative to the chiropractic practice act. The two bills, namely assembly Bill #3645 and Senate Bill #6649, provide for graduates of qualified chiropractic colleges (those colleges previously applying for registration) to sit for the New York State Chiropractic examination. The bill further provides that these chiropractic colleges will be able to matriculate students desiring to practice within the jurisdiction of New York State. This provision of the law will in reality set aside the requirements for registration of curriculum until 1974. It is essential to note that the legislation in no way alters any other provisions or qualifications existing in the previously passed (1963) chiropractic act. A substantial memorandum of support for Senate Bill #6649 and Assembly Bill 3645 was prepared by Mr. John DeLuri president of the eleven thousand man Uniform Sanitation Men's Association. This memorandum has been sent to members of the New York State Legislature. A statement of purpose submitted on behalf of the Columbia Institute of Chiropractic was prepared by Columbia's special Legal Counsel, Mr. Irving Galt.

It was a meeting to discuss the results of our deliberations in Kansas City, after the Association had considered all the changes. Dr. Simon accepted all the changes in principle and considered them a step in the right direction. He agreed that to receive acceptance by HEW, it would be necessary for us to present a united front when we discussed the possibility of acceptance of an accrediting agency with the Office of Education. He recommended having another joint meeting of all the school representatives. I intend working with Dr. Simon in hopes that we could have a joint meeting later in the evening, after our meeting Friday night, May 22nd, in Washington, D.C.

Glenn Tucson, Arizona 85716 Dear Tony: Thank you for the comments you made in your June 1st letter regarding accreditation and IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST. Accreditation has traveled the road as predicted - I understand both accrediting agencies have been turned down. There are two possible aspects for this decision by the U.S. Office of Education: 1)Their pre-stated policy to recognize only one accrediting agency for a particular specialty, which would mean we have to get together and form one accrediting agency from ACC and CCE. 2)The pressure applied by the A.M.A., particularly before, during, and after the hearing given by H.E.W. to both accrediting agencies. To me, it appears the only course which will get accreditation is to get the ACA out of the accrediting business, free their schools from the financial yolk they keep on their necks, and allow the two existing accrediting agencies, or all the schools, to set up an accrediting system which would be representative of this profession. I am suremost everyone will now agree there is no possibility either agency will be recognized. I do not believe we can make full use of our professional weight while we are split on any of the matters which have been giving the profession difficulty throughout its entire existence. If the profession were unified, it would be easy to make use of the material in the book, IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST, because we would have a proper Public Relations' Department to follow it through. It is an impossibility for one college, or one program, to do justice to a program which needs all of our combined efforts. If we were united, we could tell them to go to ___ and keep on doing our own thing. Divided, we are very vulnerable to a flank attack by anyone who decides to take a shot at us. I think we all have to be more diligent in pulling this together rather than continuing the separation which divides us. I really appreciated your comments, Tony. Kind personal regards,... HRF:mes cc: Dr. Ernest Napolitano 1973 Goldschmidt passes away\" (p. 17): We were saddened to learn of the death of Dr. Sol Goldschmidt in New York on October 14, where he had been hospitalized for a short period. Dr. Goldschmidt, 73, was a 1922 graduate of Carver Chiropractic College and practiced in the New York City area. He was active in numberous chiropractic and political groups, and served as a leading figure in the legislative battles to gain licensure in New York state. Dr. Goldschmidt had been the New York NCA delegate and executive secretary of the New York Chiropractic Association. He was a prolific writer and co-authored several books and monographs with Dr. C.W. Weiant, including the book Medicine and Chiropractic. On the political scene he was active in New York Republican circles and was a member of ACA's SCOPE Committee from 1964 until his retirement two years ago. During the past two years he served ACA as Special Consultant on Education to the Board of Governors. Services were conducted in the Parkside Memorial Chapel, Queens, New York, on October 15. The survivors are his wife, Mrs. Ann Goldschmidt; and sons, Dr. Arnold and Joseph. 1973 (Nov/Dec): Digest of Chiropractic Economics [16(3)] includes: -\"College news: Logan College of Chiropractic\" (p. 60): ...Dr. Fred J.

He graduated from Carver Chiropractic Institute in 1922, attended Columbia University and practiced for half century in the City of New York. He held the office of the Board of Trustees of the Chiropractic Institute of New York and was appointed by Governor Rockefeller as a delegate tot he White House Conference on Aging in 1970. Both the American Chiropractic Association and the New York State Chiropractic Association elected Dr. Goldschmidt to Life Membership, the highest honor accorded a member. In 1926 he married Ann Kraus, who survives. Also, his two sons, Dr. Arnold and Joel, daughters-in-law Arlene and Joyce, sisters Mrs. Fae Berger and Mrs. Olga Koenig and six grandchildren.Contributions in his memory are still being accepted for the Scholarship Fund of the New York State Chiropractic Association, 60 East 42nd Street, New York, N.Y. 10017. -\"A new educational concept: Columbia 1974\" (pp. 10-11); includes many photographs of new campus: Student Union Center on left, gym on right 1974: Edwin H.

Coggins, D.C., president of Association of Chiropractic Colleges (CCCKC archives): Dear Bill: I have your letter of January 2 in which you indicate that we should go ahead with having Mr. Melli draw up the legal contract for binding arbitration. Since we do not know who the designated signators [sic] will be for each of the chiropractic colleges, I will have Mr. Melli simply designate each of the institutions at the bottom of the contract form and the names of the designated signators can be typed in later. I have looked through my files and I do not find that I have the official names of the Cleveland Colleges. Would you forward this information to me immediately so that I can get Mr. Melli working on the contract. Each of the A.C.C. institutions should also be advised that they should supply certified copies of their enabling resolutions from the boards of trustees, a copy being sent to both you and me. I note that Dr. Napolitano has been authorized to sign for the Columbia Institute and he quotes the enabling resolution in a recent letter. However, thisresolution should be certified to make it legal and official for our records. When I receive the contract from Mr. Melli, I will forward it to you for your approval, and I would suggest that we again use your printer for printing the contracts in the interest of saving time. I should also advise you that my term as president of The Council on Chiropractic Education will terminate at the close of the C.C.E. meetings on February 10. I have served the maximum number of terms under the by-laws of the C.C.E. and will therefore not be eligible for re-election. I will turn over my file on binding arbitration to the new president of the C.C.E. on that date. Finally, we need to give present considerations to costs of drafting the contract by Mr. Melli. Item VI (H) of the Binding Arbitration Agreement of November 10 and 11 states, \"All related expenses preliminary to the signing of the binding-arbitration contract shall be borne equally by A.C.C> and C.C.E. upon demand.\" If it meets with your approval, I would suggest that upon receipt of Mr. Melli's statement the A.C.C. and C.C.E. both issue checks for one-half of the amount. If you would prefer to handle it otherwise, please let me know. I am pleased that you will be in attendance at the C.C.E. meetings in New Orleans. Any of the persons you wish to bring are certainly welcome. Sincerely yours,... 1974 (Mar 1): letter on Palmer College stationery from EVP H. Ron Frogley, D.C. to Ernest Napolitano (CCE Archives; in my NYCC file): Dear Ernest: I have just come back from the ICA Midyear Board meeting, in which I was impressed by the fact that ACC desperately needs a meeting in the very near future to consider the question of the emerging colleges such as Sherman, as well as, the enlargement of our accrediting commission and to bring everybody into focus on the binding arbitration contract. Bill said only three of us have responded to date. I discussed some of these items with Bill on the telephone during my layover in St. Louis, on Wednesday night. He is, at the present time, trying to find a date for such a meeting. Thank you so much for your quick attention to the charges for the Salt Lake City trip. I appreciate it very much. Dave is improving, he is able to sit up and eat by himself, and is under heavy therapy at the present time. He is much better than I anticipated by this time, for which I am greatly appreciative. I hope school is going well on your new campus and that the problems are not overwhelming. I look forward to seeing you at our up coming meeting.

I am sure the other two colleges will pas the same thing as soon as their boards meet. As soon as C.C.E. receives information from H.E.W., our organization will be ready for the binding arbitration, if C.C.E. is rejected. Sincerely yours,...

Report. (see Exhibit #4) (Page 28) Dr. Hidde then read a letter from Casper Weinberger, Secretary of Health Education and Welfare which was addressed to the chairman of Medical Education of the American Medical Association. This letter was in response to an appeal from the American Medical Association directly to Casper Weinberger going over the head of the United States Office of Education and requesting Mr. Weinberger to nullify the recognition of C.C.E. as an Official Accrediting Agency for the Chiropractic profession. That letter follows: March 27, 1975 C.H. William Ruhe, M.D. Secretary, Coordinating Council on Medical Education 535 N. Dearborn Street Chicago, Illinois 60610 Dear Dr. Ruhe: This is in response to your letter of November 14, 1974 requesting that I review the August 26, 1974 decision by the Commissioner of Education recognizing, for a period of one year, the Accrediting Commission of the Council on Chiropractic Education as an accrediting agency. Please accept my apology for the delay in responding. As you know, Section 1201 (A) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1141 (a)) provides that the Commissioner (of Education) shall publish a list of nationally recognized accrediting agencies or associations which he determines to be a reliable authority as to the quality of training offered. It was pursuant to this authority that the Commissioner made his August 1974 decision. This decision of the Commissioner to list the Accrediting Commission of the Council on Chiropractic Education was made only after careful deliberation of all arguments both for and against recognition. The record reveals that prior to the Commissioner's decision, representatives of the American Medical Association reviewed the petition submitted by the Council on Chiropractic Education, submitted written material in refutation of the petition and appeared at the March 1973 meeting of the Commissioner's Advisory Committee on Accreditation and Institutional Eligibility to challenge the petition. The petition was subsequently denied and an appeal by the Council on Chiropractic Education to Commissioner was denied in October 1973.The petition was later reactivated by the Council and supplementary data were filed. Representatives of the American Medical Association appeared again at the May 1974 hearing before the Advisory Committee on Accreditation and Institutional Eligibility and protested the reactivated petition. The American Medical Association also met privately with the Commissioner prior to his final decision to recognize the Accrediting Commission of the Council on Chiropractic Education. I recognize the seriousness which you attach to this matter and the earnestness with which you have pressed your views. The authority for recognizing accrediting agencies rests by statute in the Commissioner of Education, and I believe the process by which the Commissioner reached his decision was fair to the parties concerned. I also note that the Accrediting Commission of the Council will be reviewed for renewal of recognized status in September 1975, and that the American Medical Association will have an opportunity to make presentations regarding that matter. After considering the viewpoints set forth in your letter of November 14, I have concluded that further action on my part regarding the Commissioner's decision is not warranted at this time... Dr. Hidde then submitted to questions from the floor... Dr. Hidde then stressed the importance of the various state boards recognizing the C.C.E. Standards either by Statute or by administrative rule, it would be helpful if by the latter part of the summer, probably August, they would send a letter of intent to C.C.E. stating that they have adopted a resolution and are preparing to accept the C.C.E. Standards. This would be most helpful to the C.C.E. when they go in for review of their H.E.W. approval in September.

Weiant, D.C., Ph.D. to Russell Gibbons: Clarence W. Weiant, D.C., Ph.D. 809 Terrace Place, Peekskill, New York 10566 December 10, 1975 Dear Mr. Gibbons: I believe something is stirring. I hope you have heard from Al Werner. After I had written to him he called me and gave me some very interesting information. The late Dr. Clarence Flick set up a foundation called the Foundation for Health Research. For 22 months the Foundation had the services of a lawyer, Cyrus Lerner, who at one time was in the service of the late Joseph Kennedy, then our Ambassador to Britain. As an employee of the Foundation he received a salary of $1,000 per month, in those days no small figure. Lerner did a very thorough job. He had access to just about everything in the archives of the Palmer School (as it was then called). He relied upon the local Davenport public library for old writings of D.D. Palmer and made photocopies. He examined court records. He collected old newspapers dating back to the 1850's, with accounts of a running feud between D.D. Palmer and Andrew Still. He located as many people as possible who had had personal dealings with D.D. Palmer and conducted taped interviews with them. A number of these people were in Oklahoma; others were on the West Coast. Most of them are now dead. Let's hope the tapes have not deteriorated. He correlated developments in chiropractic with contemporaneous goings on in American medicine, politics, and popular thought. Albert Werner, son of the older Werner who headed the American Bureau of Chiropractic, Dr. Lyndon Lee (now in his 80's and still practicing in Mt. Vernon, N.Y.), and a third man whose last name is Thomas (a Long Island resident who had been the real framer and manager of the American Bureau) were chosen to be the trustees of the Foundation. For a long time the trustees did nothing. They felt that the next phase should be directed by a chiropractic college. They did not trust the Palmer School to bring out an uncensored history of chiropractic. Meanwhile the New York State law licensing chiropractors came into existence (1963), but the New York State Board of Regents was not prepared to approve any school of chiropractic in the state. Eventually the National College was approved, but the trustees did not want to surrender their obligations to people that far away. So what they did was to resign their trusteeships and turn everything over to Columbia Institute, after the Chiropractic Institute of New York had merged with National College.As I understand it, however, the bulk of the material accumulated is in the physical custody of Mr. Thomas, awaiting further developments. The financial resources of the Foundation have shrunk to the mere pittance of about $150. I am urging that Columbia Institute begin as soon as possible to embark on the utilization and proper presentation of the data accumulated. Werner said he would talk to Dr. Napolitano and would tell him that I would be willing to serve as an occasional consultant. Of course I shall insist that you, if satisfactory terms can be reached, be named as director of the project (or any other appropriate title). I have also suggested that FCER be solicited for funds to go ahead. Given some such provocative title as THE LONG SUPPRESSED STORY OF CHIROPRACTIC ORIGINS, the resulting book should really be at least a good (if not best) seller.

Dean, M.B., D.C. in his chiropractic necrology (p. 298): DEAN, FRANK E., D.C. (b. Easton, Pa., Oct. 13, 1891, d. New York, May 12, 1958). A lifelong student of the biological sciences, teacher, philanthropist and school founder, Frank E. Dean remains an enigmatic figure in chiropractic. Little is known of his early years other than that he studied abroad before the onset of World War I. After receiving a bachelor of medicine degree at the University of Warsaw, Poland, he continued his studies at Heidelberg, The Sorbonne, and the Imperial Institute of Russia, under Prof. Serge Voronoff, a world-noted neurologist. It is also said that he studied under the famed Austrian surgeon, Dr. Adolf Lorenz. Later, he traveled to Africa, Central America and South America to observe native healing techniques. What persuaded Dean to follow a career in chiropractic is uncertain, but some accounts suggest that he first studied osteopathy. He received his D.C. degree from the Standard School of Chiropractic, New York, about 1917. It is the early history of the Columbia Institute of Chiropractic (now New York Chiropractic College) that is the known legend of Dr. Dean. He founded the school under a Delaware charter dated Nov. 19, 1919 (thought to be the profession's first nonprofit educational institution). In 1920, he obtained a charter for the Advanced School of Chiropractic and for a time operated both schools simultaneously in New York City. The Columbia College of Chiropractic in Baltimore, Md., was established by Dr. Dean in 1946 and continued until June, 1954, when it was consolidated with the Columbia Institute. Dr. Dean also had a well-established private practice in New York in New York City, and it was from much of this income that the Columbia Institutes weathered difficult times. His wife, Lorraine Welch, D.C., Ph.D., a former student of Dean's, shared many of his teaching and administrative responsibilities during the 1940's and 50's. After Dr. Dean's passing, the board of trustees named Dr. Ernest G. Napolitano president of the Columbia Institute to preserve and continue the work of a chiropractic pioneer. Known today as the New York Chiropractic College, it is a fully accredited, first-professional- degree-granting institution under an absolute charter granted by the State of New York. 1980: Rehm (1980) includes Lorraine Welch, D.C., Ph.D. in his chiropractic necrology (p. 332): WELCH, LORRAINE, D.C., Ph.D. (b. Parsons, Kan., Feb. 8, 1901, d. New York, N.Y., March 24, 1974). Lorraine Welch abandoned a career considered, at that time, more suitable for women - teachingchildren, and like Mabel Palmer, excelled in a profession dominated by men. She had earned both a bachelor and a master of arts degree at the Texas State College for Women (now Texas Women's University) in Denton, Texas, and, in 1930, enrolled at New York's Columbia University to study for a Ph.D. There, she became a patient of Dr. Frank E. Dean, founder of the Columbia Institute of Chiropractic, whom she later married. Always known by her maiden name, Dr. Welch became associated with the Columbia Institute as registrar in 1930. In 1942, she received her D.C. degree from CIC and began to share many of her husband's teaching and administrative responsibilities. From 1946 to 195, they supervised an affiliated institution, the Columbia College of Chiropractic, in Baltimore, Md. In February, 1956, Dr. Welch earned her long-delayed Ph.D. degree at New York University. The title of her thesis was \"Chiropractic, An Evolving Art, Science and Philosophy.\" After Dr. Frank Dean died in 1958, Lorraine Welch continued her association with Columbia Institute as an educational consultant. She also continued to supervise the private practice her husband had established in New York City. 1981 (Apr): ACA Journal of Chiropractic includes: -\"NYCC to honor Napolitano\" (p. 18); notes Napolitano won Purple Heart and Bronze Star during WWII -Ernest Napolitano, D.C. authors \"Inaugural address\" (pp. 20- 1); includes: Being able to accept your kind and flattering invitation to present this inaugural address has several overtones of special significance to me.

I could provide Keating with a great deal of info about Kightlinger. I agree with you that it would be wonderful for me, after 58 years in the profession, to see the development of the New York College at the Seneca campus. However, I have been under the weather as a result of surgery which took place a year ago, and I am first becoming more active and back to my old self. I will try to attend the meeting in October. By the way, I have Weiant's old Analyte instrument, which was the first development that depicted areas of hyperemia on the spine, and a number of valuable old books which should be placed in the college museum library. Although I wrote to Ken Padgett some time ago, I have received no response from him. Perhaps you can get some action on the matter. I thought the profession has made considerable progress after all these years. However, is it true that there are now four organizations in this state? With best regards from Ruth and myself...

Mazzarelli Sr., D.C. passed away on January 6, 1995. Dr. Mazzarelli was a noted member and past president of the ICA and made many contributions to that association and the profession. Dr. Mazzarelli was a graduate of Palmer School of Chiropractic, where he served as a member of the board of trustees since 1975. He was a key proponent of the transformation of Northern California College of Chiropractic to Palmer College of Chiropractic West. Dr. Mazzarelli served as chairman of the board of PCCW. While recovering from a bout of malaria while stationed in the Caribbean during World War II, Dr. Mazzarelli received his first chiropractic adjustment. After the war, he made chiropractic his profession, and began a private practice, first in Camden, N.J. and later in Pennsauken. During his career he served as president of both the New Jersey and South Jersey Chiropractic Societies, and received numerous honors, including honorary degrees from Palmer, Palmer West and Columbia College [sic] of Chiropractic. Dr. Mazzarelli is survived by his wife, Ann, his daughter Jo Ann Heidenreich, of Nashville, Tenn., and two sons, Dr. Joseph Mazzarelli, Jr., of Cinnaminson, N.J., and Dr. Frank Mazzarelli of Tampa, Florida. 1995 (Apr 3): letter from Cruse J. Howe, D.C. in Syracuse NY to Ed Kimmel, D.C. in Ocala FL (in my Kimmel file): Dear Ed.\u2014 I realize that I am no the best correspondent in the profession. My perception of time is somewhat of a \"blur,\" and so much space has gone by since your most welcome letter(s) without an answer from me that I am bordering upon being ashamed! Please forgive. Yes, I would enjoy some time reminiscing with you. It seems that Florida never has a place on my agenda. My only remaining family ties are in Utah, and I usually try to head West whenever I am inclined to travel (which is not often). Dottie and I are meeting my sister and her husband in Seattle about July 1st and from there we're cruising to Alaska. Alaska is about the only place left that I am attracted to. So, I'll get that out of my system. Anyhow, one never knows: I may find myself in Florida some day. Rest assured you'll hear from me \"if and when.\" I was quite surprised to learn that Leonard Kamm had crossed your path again. Destiny, I suppose. Bob Lynch (now deceased) has a chiro son who practices in Portland, ME, and he is currently the Maine Delegate. I understand that he is a very bright one, and has a definite future in ACA's hierarchy (the poor guy!). You asked about the Synchrotherm. It developed that the F.D.A. tentacles reached out and snared it at the U.S.-Canadian border. You may remember hat the engineering was not the best, and the instruments, it seemed were continually n need of repair. They were continually intercepted at the border when mailed for repairs. Canadian Memorial set up a repair station in Michigan to circumventthe F.D.A. Somehow - and I'm not certain exactly how it came about, - the program gradually lost momentum. You may recall that Andy Peterson and Ronnie Watkins were the promoters. They are both living in California. I had a letter from Andy a couple of years ago in which he offered to accept a $5,000 investment from me as part of a venture which was going to create a new \"hot\" instrument. I'm afraid to say that I did not respond. Ronnie is still in practice, and I sent him one of my letters about BioCranial Technique. He responded with a very philosophical letter, and he is next on my list to write to after I finish this one to you. I have maintained a very close relationship with Ed McGinnis. He has retired and sold his practice to his son, John. He has another son (Kevin) who practices on the coast of NC. Ed and his wife reside on Pawley's Island (near Myrtle Beach) and Ed is retired except for an occasional fillin in when needed by John in Sumter. Ed and John recently joined me in Charlotte, N.C. for a B.C.T. seminar. They left that seminar with great positive anticipation for the future of their practice - having thoroughly enjoyed the teachings and the numerous anecdotal stories re the results which can be obtained. While in Charlotte, I received the depressing news that my Salt Lake City brother-in-law has been dx'd as having the \"big C.\" Meanwhile, my son, Cruse, is recovering from reconstructive knee surgery (ruptured A.C.L. while skiing). He will be back to work in a couple of weeks. At that time, I will go to Utah to see if I can be of assistance. I am told that there are many histories of effective B.C.T. use, and feel it incumbent on me to try to help him. Sid Birdsley's son, Galen, is a D.C. in Salt Lake. Acting on my urging, Galen equipped himself with B.C.T., so if I am successful in the assistance of Jack, he will be able to take over when I return to Syracuse. Ed, I was watching \"Sonja Live\" on CNN about a year ago when, much to my complete surprise, your son Michael appeared as a guest!! He displayed your intelligence, was totally at ease in expressing his ideas. I do not recall the subject of the interview, although for sure it was a social issue. He showed up, I recall, as being quite liberal. You must be very proud of him. Are you ready for this? I was invited, and have accepted, to teach at the Seneca Falls campus of the New York Chiropractic College. I will be assisting in Technique, and will be there starting in May on Wednesday morning from 8 til 12 noon. I know not how this will turn out - I think I will enjoy the experience - and it may do me a lot of good to have some time with the young folks. I will be teaching nothing but the basics. I am continually being asked if I would be teaching B.C.T., and my answer, is \"Oh, no. I would never give the keys to a Cadillac to my 16 ear old son!!\" Also, I have taken to assisting Dr. Boyd in the teaching of B.C.T. at his seminars. He is booked to do two seminars for the NYCC in October: consecutive weekends at the Long Island campus and at the Seneca Falls campus. I think it is time to leave you for now. I am glad to know that you are married, and that live is good to you. I promise that if you write, I will respond in time. Meanwhile, take good care of yourself. Sincerely, CRUSE 1995 (June): Chiropractic Goldschmidt was the sixth president of AHC, but also its Ambassador of Good Will to the Profession at Large. His death last December 26, 1994 in Phoenix, Arizona was not only a loss to the Association, but to the profession. Dr. Goldschmidt was elected to his third term as president of the Association for the History of Chiropractic at New York Chiropractic College last October. He was a trustee of NYCC and past president of the Federation of Chiropractic Licensing Boards. Ironically, the third president of AHC was Dr. Ernest Napolitano, the president of NYCC when he died in 1985. Mickey had given much of his time in advancing the interests of the college at its upstate location in Seneca Falls and hosted the 1994 AHC conference there in October 1994. One of the first members of the New York State Board of Chiropractic after licensure was achieved in 1963, ArnoldGoldschmidt continued the pioneering work of his father, Sol Goldschmidt, a Carver Institute graduate who was long-time executive secretary of the New York State Chiropractic Society and was in the vanguard of licensing battles for more than 30 years. The senior Goldschmidt had also co-authored with Clarence Weiant one of the first scholarly arguments of the profession, Medicine and Chiropractic, which was reprinted in seven editions. Arnold Goldschmidt attended Western Reserve University and Logan College before graduating from the Chiropractic Institute of New York in 1950. He was an intern at Spears Chiropractic Hospital in Denver for a year prior to starting his practice in Manhattan. A former president of the New York Chiropractic Association, he was active in the process of the sitting examinations by the New York Board and also taught classes in chiropractic ethics at NYCC and other colleges. He was elected a Fellow of both the American College of Chiropractors and the International College of Chiropractors. \"Mickey's whole life was chiropractic,\" said Dr. Val Pasqua of Larchmont, who delivered the eulogy at the December 28 service in New York. \"He was dedicated to the quality of his profession and brought dignity and good humor in articulating the many roles he enjoyed in chiropractic.\" Dr. Goldschmidt was honored as a New York Pioneer of Chiropractic at NYCC in 1993. He is survived by his wife Lucille, two daughters, Lisa and Rhonda and a son, Peter. 1995 (July 28): e-mail from Ed Kimmel DC to J.C. Keating: Dear Joe, At this point in time, Xmas sounds like a great idea. Let me know the exact time and dates of your visit to your sister. I think Seminole is closer than you think. Received two letters from you today. The one from Weiant to Hayes, that brings up a lot of memories. I don't remember having met Hayes, but I know that I had some correspondence with him. I seemed to agree with his philosophy in his editorials. Weiant was truly a principled man. I could TELL you stories about Napolitano and the school he took over when Dean died. Don't forget, I went to CIC, under Public Law 16 (GI BILL for disabled vets) when Dean was still alive and teaching. I mentioned to you that I left when he took all his equipment to Baltimore to get State approval for CIC in Baltimore. I worked for Martin Phillips, back in 1946. He owned an X-ray lab. Another partner of his was N. Robert Limber, D.C. who now retired to Florida. I used to see Bob Limber at meetings in Broward County when I practiced in Ft. Lauderdale. That would be a source of sleazy intrigue, if you could get Limber to speak the about the Atlantic States school. Napolitano offered me a job at CIC, when he took over, but I refused, as did most of the faculty of CINY. Charles Lamendola, another instructor at CINY, also was offered a position by Nappy. What we did in Denver at the ACA convention was historic. Get to the ACA archives and minutes of that meeting and you will have a ball. We threw the convention into a \"committee of the whole,\" a parliamentary procedure that shook the very foundation of the NCA/ACA, and allowed none of the officers to take part in the proceedings. What a time! Called Dinty, NO ANSWER. Will try again! I was one of the first trustees for FACE (Foundation for the Advancement of Chiropractic Education) 1964. Harold Keifer, Rex Parker, and some others are still around. When I see you I will be able to take you back to that time and tell you some stories. Can't write all of them down. They keep buzzing around in my feeble brain. Also received your letter to Glenda. Good try. I hope she responds favorably. Be good! I'll call Dinty, again. Oh yes, another source would be Charlie Krasner, now in Florida, also. He received license #2, Dinty got #1 after we got our law in 1964. I passed the exam, which wasone of the most outrageous medical examinations that I had ever seen. I passed Connecticut's Basic Science exam in 1949, given to me by professors at Yale Univ. That was tough, but NY was tougher. TTFN, ED 1995 (July 29): letter from Abne Eisenberg DC, PhD: ...But there was another school in New York -- the Columbia Institute of Chiropractic headed by Ernest Napolitano, D.C. It was housed in a brownstone building on 71st Street on the West Side of New York. Its reputation was not good. In fact, when any of our faculty was dismissed, he/she often ended up on the Columbia faculty. Napolitano was an astute businessman and, not long thereafter, Columbia was renamed the New York College of Chiropractic and relocated out on Long Island. It flourished with Napolitano at its helm. And, as you know, it was recently relocated to a 300 acre site in Seneca Falls, upstate New York... 1995 (Sept 28): letter from Julius Dintenfass DC: Dear Joe: It has been quite a while since I have last written to you, but my life has been rather hectic htese past few years. What with my illness, and retirement from practice after 60 years, I have had little time for anything else. I am writing to you now about your article \"The Chiropractic Institute of New York: Remembering an Intellectual Heritage.\" I think it would be much clearer to your readers if you explain that the Chiropractic Institute of New York was founded by a fusion of three schools of Chiropractic: The Eastern Chiropractic Institute, the New York School of Chiropractic and The Standard Institute of Chiropractic. Then go into the history of each school. John Nugent did a remarkable job in getting these schools together and I sat down with him making suggestions for the Chiropractic Institute. Nugent was a \"fighting Irishman\", and a very sincere individual and he wanted to do only what was best for the profession of chiropractic. One of the suggestions I made to him was that the chiropractic curriculum should have a separate and detailed course in Kinesiology itself. Up to this point what was taught on Kinesiology was taken up in Anatomy, which described the movement of joints and muscles. After studying the subject in detail, I felt that Kinesiology would be valuable subject for the chiropractic profession, in understanding the bio-mechanical functions of the body. The suggestion was adopted, and the Chiropractic Institute was the first of chiropractic colleges to offer a separate two-semester course on the subject of Kinesiology. An outstanding faculty already existed in the prior schools. This included Craig Kightlinger, a leader in the profession, who was a remarkable man, great organizer and an excellent speaker on the subject of chiropractic. C.W. Weiant, my mentor, was a very unusualy analytical instructor and served the profession in many ways by organizing early research programs and writing research articles. Thure Peterson and Harry Trubenbach made great contributions as proponents of Carver Chiropractic, which contributed a great deal to the development of our profession. They stressed that structure and function are inseparable and the state of health of the human body may be interpreted with mechanical criteria. Their most important contribution is \"The Principle of Basic and Compensatory Distortion\". Thus, when a basic structure moves in relation to the body gravity line relative and superimposed must alter their relation to that line all equilibrium is lost. In your reference to me on page 3, I believe that my greatest contribution was as editor of Science Sidelights, which incidentally appeared as a column in the NCA Journal for a period of about six years and was then published by me and distributed to the profession at large. This publication, which depended upon material gathered from medical journals from all over the world, became very popular because it provided the only publication for the layman which did not depend solely on testimonials to endorse chiropractic. My book,Chiropractic -- A Modern Way to Health, (Pyramid 1970), became an all time best seller in explaining chiropractic and helping hundreds of future chiropractors to decide to enter the profession after reading this book. The active support of the National Chiropractic Association helped to distribute over 400,000 copies of this book. A correction to be made in this paragraph is that I was not founding Secretary of New York's first Board of Chiropractic Examiners. The Secretary of all the professional boards was an employee of the State Department of Education and was appointed by the Board of Regents. I was, however, Chairman of the Board of Examiners. The word \"notoriety\" is not suitable to describe my position on JMPT. Mortimer Levine was the strongest and most vociferous proponent of Carver Chiropractic which he explained in his book, The Structural Approach to Chiropractic. On page 4 you indicated that New York's chiropractic law was enacted in 1964. This is incorrect. It was enacted in 1963. On page 6 an incorrect statement is made \"unwilling to merge with Columbia...\" is incorrect. There was a long period of negotiation between CINY and Columbia. Talks were broken off because Columbia refused to accept CINY's demand for equal representation on the Board of Trustees. Then CINY merged with the National College of Chiropractic in 1968. There is much to tell about the others. Perhaps, you can find suitable time to hear this. I could phone you and answer your questions. Please let me know when you would be available. I still have boxes of material referring to my early days in chiropractic, which I have not been able to get to. Be assured that as soon as I do, I will send them to you. Sincerely yours, Julius Dintenfass, D.C. 1995 (Oct 20): telephone interview well; Nugent came along, Kight \"saw the light\" in terms of educational reforms -Stephen Owens DC (Hartford CT office: 203-232-3111) was chairman of CINY's board of trustees during attempt to merge CINY with Columbia Institute of Chiropractic -Dintenfass was 1936 grad of ECI; healthy lifestyles were not emphasized in curriculum, except by individual instructors -Dintenfass began teaching at ECI in 1936 upon his graduation; taught pathology; remained on faculty 20-25 years -NYSCA had detective agency to check out all new pts in DCs' offices; schools operated \"sub rosa\" -there were 25-30 students in Dintenfass' graduating class, and perhaps 100 students in total student body in 1936; tuition was $35-40/month; no evening classes; curriculum was 3 years of 6 mo. -Dintenfass' first NCA convention was Toronto, 1938; was invited to write column for Toronto Star for several years (1938-1940?) 1995 (Nov 4): e-mail from Ed Kimmel DC: Dear Joe: Thanks for your interest in ACA policies during their 1964 formative year. I don't recall, buit I had to relinquish my faculty position because I was elected a emmber of FACE (the Foundation for Accredtied Chiropractic Education) the forerunner on FCER. We we assigning grant monies to the various schools. It was thought that becasue I was a member of the faculty of CINY, there would present a conflict of interest. This was especially true when monies were to be doled out to the Columbia Institue of Chiropractic (CIC). I started my chiropractic education at CIC. When Frank Dean opened his Baltimore branch, he took all the equipemnt and visual aids to Maryland, in order to get approval from the education department. This infuriated many of us who were going to school under the auspices of the G.I. Bill. just after World War II. That was 1946/1947.Re: the Constitution and By-Laws that were handed to us by LM Rogers, they were an almost word for word copy of the NCA's. Asa Brown, from Virginia recognizing the duplicity, pulled the cover off the by'laws and proclaimed that the intention of the powers that be was fraudulent. That's when the Delegates, angered by the deception, went into a Committe of the Whole, and eliminated any interference from the so called power brokers. ACA should have the minutes of the Denver, 1964 meeting. I requested them but to no avail. Maybe someone with more authority than I have can get them for you. I know you will find them fascinating with lots of info.maybe someone on you e-mail list can help obtain them. I started with NCA in Chicago, 1963 and went on to Denver in 1964. Good Luck, ED 1995 (Dec 14): letter from Bill Rehm DC: Dear Joe, Further to your Kightlinger paper, Table 3, Frank E. Dean was founder & president of the Advanced School of Chiropractic. The school continued in operation for a time even after the Columbia Institute was established. Both schools advertised simultaneously in the NYSCS Journal -- The Messenger. Dean was advertised as \"Founder & President\" of Advanced, and \"Dean\" of CIC. The two brownstone \"campuses\" were only a few blocks apart. The Lyndon E. Lee Papers include a file on the early NYC chiro schools. Next time I can get back to the PCC Archives, I want to go through the Lee Papers again for dope on Lee's argument with the state branch of the UCA over the \"Model Bill\" (much colorful correspondence), and background for a story on C.R. Johnston, the well-known blind D.C. for whom Clarence Weiant was once employed. I also need to get to Denver to finish my new story on Spears. Just now, am doing an article about Lee for the ACA Journal. Be talking to you. B 1995 (Dec 22): e-mail from Ed Kimmel DC: ...Frank Dean, from Columbia was not fond of Kight. Either it was professional jealousy or Kight's original association with BJ. Maybe they were at odds because of the two schools of thought or their competition for students. As you recall, I went to CIC for my freshman year, then transferred to CINY, because Dean took all his visual aid equipment and books from the library to his Maryland school. For more history re: early CIC, I think a Leo Klein, may still be somewhere in the Baltimore area. What with what's happening in the government with Medicare and Medicaid, I wonder where chiropractic will fit in. What are the students and other members of the faculty's feeling on this matter? When I was in Ft Laud for the FCA convention (need my Continuing Ed Credits) they all, for the most part had a doomy gloom attitude, re: their practices. Enjoy Phoenix, if that's where you are. Keep in touch. ED 1996 (Feb 26): letter from Bill Rehm DC: Dear Joe: In your \"History of Chiropractic Education,\" Appendix B, I question the photo identified as Bill Coggins. Norm Osborne is my guess, although it resembles Goodfellow. The discussion in the minutes of Jan. '48 about Baltimore's Columbia College intrigued me. \"...a little over a year ago (Dr. Dean) organized a branch college in Baltimore, Md.\" What a grossly inaccurate statement. Dean did not \"organize\" the school in a vacuum. Chances are the trustees were planning the branch operation well before the war ended. After all, the new school would be taking advantage of G.I.benefits. (I'm not sure if the New York school qualified.) A facility has to be purchased, inspected and approved by the V.A. There was also paperwork to file with the state department of education and the chiropractic board. A faculty had to be in place, students recruited, etc., etc. None of this could have taken place \"a little over a year ago.\" The new school opened on Sept. 3, 1946 as the Columbia Institute of Chiropractic - Baltimore. In '48, CIC became the independently chartered Columbia College. A much larger facility was leased in '49 while a search began for permanent quarters. (The original building was still owned by the corporation.) There was serious discussion of purchasing a small residential hotel and one or more buildings of a women's college that was relocating to the suburbs. A fund-raising effort was started. The faculty (all part-time) was well paid - $40+ an hour depending on academic qualifications. It was a great source of supplemental income. I suspect the \"good pay\" was at the root of much resentment against the college. It is a fact that the board of examiners and the state association always opposed Columbia. Lots of intrigue. I remember seeing Nugent on campus at least twice, and witnessed a wild debate between he and others over Columbia's quest for NCA accreditation. (The school was ICA approved.) But that's another story. I'm sorry there isn't a Columbia still here. I should do a paper about it. I've said before and it proves out in all the material you've recently sent me - Nugent was a thug! But I guess thugs tramp where others fear to tread. Thanks for everything, Joe. Sincerely,... 1999 (Sept/Oct): Activator Update [14(5)] includes: -\"A tribute to 1932-1998\" (p. 18): Dr. Anthony A. Pavia, graduate of Columbia Institute of Chiropractic (1954), died October 22, 1998 at Nyack Hospital in Nyack, NY. He was 66 years old. Dr. Pavia held two active practices at the time of his death, in Bronx, NY (est. 1954) and in New City, NY (est. 1960). He is survived by his wife of 39 years, Natalie, six children, two of which are practicing chiropractors and NYCC graduates (Steven '84, and Ronald '93), and four grandchildren. Dr. Pavia was a charter member of the New York State Chiropractic Association, and past president of District 14. He was also past president of the Columbia Institute of Chiropractic Alumni Assn., a member of the American Chiropractic Assn., and served as an ancillary faculty member of New York Chiropractic College (NYCC), where he taught technique workshops in the Activator Method. He was a staff instructor of Activator Methods International, Ltd., where he was a platform speaker at seminars throughout the Northeast U.S. Dr. Pavia was a charter member of CEFNY and the National Institute of Chiropractic Research. Dr. Pavia served as president of New City Rotary, and the United Italian-American Civic Assn., and was appointed to the Preventative Health Services Block Grant Advisory Council by New York State Senator, Joseph R. Holland. Dr. Pavia was a role model for many future DCs, who were inspired to become chiropractors themselves, by his expertise, sense of humor, and dedication tot he art, philosophy, and sciences of chiropractic. He was a loving, caring, father, grandfather, teacher, and mentor. Anthony Pavia was loved by many in and out of his field, and will be missed by many more. 1999 (Nov): ICA Review [56(5)] includes: -\"In memoriam: Bruce of Dr. Ehlich and:Dr. Bruce Ehlich, dedicated ICA member and representative assemblyman, passed away unexpectedly Tuesday, October 5, 1999, at his home in Cowpens, South Carolina. Dr. Ehlich first became interested in chiropractic when he saw his mother's health greatly improve after receiving regular chiropractic adjustments to correct vertebral subluxations. He decided to commit his life to the profession and attended Columbia Institute of Chiropractic (now New York Chiropractic College) where he met Judy, a fellow student and his future wife. Dr. Ehlich graduated from chiropractic college in 1962 and practiced in New York City until 1964 when Judy graduated. They were married and relocated to Chesnee, South Carolina, where the first Ehlich Chiropractic Clinic opened in December, 1964. Bruce and Judy Ehlich are the parents of five children, all of whom have chosen careers in chiropractic. Four of the Ehlich children are graduates of Sherman College of Straight Chiropractic in Spartanburg, South Carolina, and the youngest, Kendra is currently a student. \"The death of Bruce Ehlich brings a profound sense of loss to the Sherman College family,\" said Sherman College President David B. Koch, D.C. \"The example he and Judy have set in their practice for so many years has been a great inspiration to their children, as well as to many others who have pursued a career in chiropractic because of their leadership. Our current students, our alumni and the many friends of straight chiropractic who knew Bruce Ehlich mourn with his family,\" he said. Dr. Ehlich, lovingly known as \"Elvis\" to his ICA colleagues, served many years as the ICA representative assemblyman for South Carolina and was a past vice chairman and chairman of the Representative Assembly. He was elected by his peers to the ICA Board of Directors where he served from 1975 to 1982. Most recently, Dr. Ehlich was president of the Distinguished Fellows of ICA (FICA), and the ICA Assembly Representative for his state. \"Dr. Ehlich will be deeply missed at ICA,\" said ICA President Dr. Robert Hoffman. \"But we want his family to know that even as we mourn his passing, he eaves behind colleagues who will always remember him with affection. His enthusiasm and exuberance were contagious and we are fortunate that he chose to serve as a volunteer leader for ICA for so many years.\" Dr. Ehlich was actively involved in chiropractic on the local level as well. He belonged to the South Carolina Chiropractic Association (SCCA) and served on that group's strategic planning committee. The Ehlich family has requested that all donations in his honor be made to the Dr. Bruce Ehlich Memorial Scholarship Fund at Sherman College of Straight Chiropractic. 2000 (May 7): letter from Bill Rehm DC: Dear Joe: It was with some dismay that read C.W. Weiant's comments 29]. A merger between CINY and CIC was expected, and when it failed to materialize there was a lot of speculation about what went wrong. It is true that Ernie had money and connections. Frank Dean was and remains an enigma. I visited NYCC some years ago hoping to find in the archives anything about Dean, particularly his earlier years. It was then that Ernie said two things that I found hard to believe: he (Ernie) did not personally know Dean, and that Dean had burned his personal files shortly before death. In the late '60s, I was talking with Lorraine Welch at a meeting in NYC. The evening before, Clinic Masters had presented Ernie a check for $10,000 and I commented to Dr. Welch about it. Her response was, \"Right as if it doesn't come with obligations.\" It would be years before I understood what she meant -- CCE placing NYCC on probation because of its \"unholy alliance\" with Clinic Masters. Martin Phillips was another matter. I once heard him claiming to have operated on his own hip. Yes, this man was definitely a fraud.Frank Dean, though, was a dedicated and disciplined educator. I don't know what he was paid as president of two institutions, but he gave back plenty, especially to Columbia in Baltimore. The faculty, all part-time, were well paid -- $30 to $40 a hour depending on academic credentials. When I arrived as a student in 1951, the postwar boom was already wearing off and the new two-year pre-pro entrance requirements certainly didn't help. Still, the NCA considered Columbia of Baltimore -- \"the best of the non-accredited schools\" -- worth saving. With an infusion of NCA matching dollars, CCC would begin teaching the \"forbidden\" modalities and install a human dissection lab, among other things. In the spring of 1953, an open meeting took place at a Baltimore hotel to discuss proposed improvements to curriculum and plant. John Nugent was there for the NCA, but the ICA turned out in force. What should have been a straight-forward presentation quickly degenerated into a chaos of shouting and personal insults hurled by the ICA group. My father, an attorney who attended the meeting with me, couldn't believe what he was witnessing. That rancorous meeting is an untold story of chiropractic's absurd paranoia. Details might yet exist in the NYCC archives, but probably not. One of the possible scenarios for the cash-energized CCC was to sell its two downtown properties and purchase a large (5-story) building in Baltimore's midtown vacated by a women's college that had recently removed to the suburbs. Columbia College of Chiropractic could have survived and flourished. But it didn't happen, of course. What happened to the buildings? 807 Cathedral Street, which the school originally occupied and quickly outgrew, was sold and ever since occupied by an engineering firm. 119 W. Franklin Street was torn down years ago for a parking lot. The Enoch Pratt Library for the Blind was eventually built there. The handsome former women's college that might have become CCC is still there but vacant. It had been occupied by the Central Maryland Red Cross until it, too, fled to the suburbs. In this whole story, fleeing seemed the simplest answer. Bill 2001 (Jan 3): e-mail from Frank J. Nicchi, D.C. (fnicchi@nycc.edu): Dear Dr. Keating, I am in receipt of your letter indicating an interest in preparing a volume on the history of NYCC. We may very well have an interest in such a project. Could you please give me an indication of what resources (financial or otherwise) would be required? Thank you. Yours truly, Frank J. Nicchi, D.C. , President New York Chiropractic College, P.O. Box 800, Seneca Falls, NY 13148-0800 Tel - (315) 568-3100 Fax- (315) 568-3012 e-mail - fnicchi@nycc.edu 2002 (Jan 5): e-mail from Michael Moross DC (MCM CHEF@aol.com): Dear Joe, If you give me enough time, I might remember something of value to you. At almost 87 years it isn't easy to get both gray cells to operate at the same time. Let's start with Dr. Frank E. Dean. He never said very much about himself, directly. He alluded to several aspects of his life, but I was always skeptical as to their truth. He rambled on about attending a medical school in Germany (Berlin?), but I suspect he more likely was from the Pennsylvania Dutch. When I first met him (1939), he was just beginning to recover from a serious automobile accident (He was a very erratic driver, completly unpredictable) His hands had been injured, a disaster for a chiropractor). He offered two sets of classes, one for $600, the otherfor $900. Actually, everyone took the same curriculum with the same teachers and in the same rooms at the same time. As his hands improved, he was able to instruct in adjusting, and he adjusted each of the students in rotation. His disdain for the medical profession was ever present. He tried to persuade us to use home remedies for nonchiropractic problems. Lemon was his favorite; we called it \"Lemona therapy). to be continued... 2002 (Jan 8): telephone interview with Michael Moross DC (MCM CHEF@aol.com): -was in National Guard, working in Watertown NY when struck by car, led to neck & arm injury, treated by supply sargent/DC who was CIC alumnus who later practiced in Bronx -MM enrolled at CIC in 1939, 4-year course; was not drafted, but joined maritime service stationed at Manhattan Beach Hospital, then transferred to examining station where he did x-ray work and attended CIC days; graduated 1943 -MM joined CIC faculty circa 1944, lectured for $10/hr (good pay); taught special anatomy, abnormal psycholoy, x-ray interpretation, and saw patients in CIC clinic -didn't get along with Lorraine Welch, who he describes as \"motor mouth\" who was hypercritical and embarrased people -Harry Rudeman DC was an intellectual, had master's degree -Lustic MD was \"a good physician,\" kind man, taken advantage of by DCs, had license suspended one year through action of State Education Department for \"consorting\" with DCs -MM left CIC circa 1951, practiced in Manhattan in same building as Lustig 2002 (Jan 10): e-mail from Michael Moross DC (MCM CHEF@aol.com) After mulling over the names on the lists you sent and talking about those days, I recalled the name of the chiropractor who, as supply sergeant, gave me my first adjustment. He was Dr. Frank Owen(s?) of the Seventh Reg, 107th Coast Artillery, NYS National Guard. He was also a member of the NYC Old Guard. I also remembered some incidents involving Dr. Dean. I forgot to tell you that I also taught in Baltimore when that branch was opened. When I was graduated from CIC, I took the State Board Exam in Baltimore, and may I say, with pardonable pride, that I received the highest score of anyone up to that date. So, I would leave NYC most Sunday evenings, sleep in a freezing room, in order to teach Monday and Tuesday, then take the train back to NYC for patients and classes at CIC. One of those evenings in Baltimore, Dr. Dean, ever the sport, took a group of us to an expensive restaurant for the specialty of the house: soft-shell crabs. I think he really couldn't afford the tab, but he typically did things \"spur of the moment.\" At another time he invited me to accompany him home. He and Lorraine owned a house in Suffolk County, Long Island, but she remained in Manhattan It was a long ride by train , then a car ride to his house, with a stop at the local butcher shop. He bought 4 loin lamb chop, each 2\" thick. We took a dip in the L.I. Sound while the charcoal fire heated up. Those chops were cooked for less than three minutes! and we ate them ravenously. The next day we returned to NYC. Then I was sure who had been at fault in his accident. 2002 (Jan 16): interview with Michael Moross DC at his home: -Michael born 15 March 1915; married Frances Moross in 1941 -Michael served as x-ray technician in maritime service hospital; all patients were x-rayed by \"photofluorography\" -when Michael taught at CIC 1943-1957, Dr. Dean was still at NYC campus, although he was slowing down -Michael has two B.S. degrees, one from CCNY circa 1950, later earned M.S. in education at Hoffstra University circa 1960, taught school and became assistant principal at ghetto school in Bronx-Michael was an ACA member for a while; no malpractice insurance -at CIC, he taught inorganic chemistry (Kimmel was his student, recalls explosion of hydrogen container during lab which Kimmel was holding) -Michael also taught \"special anatomy\" (eye, heart, brain); bought beef parts, preserved in formaldehyde, which damaged his mucous membranes -Egon Leffman, D.C. had \"dry sense of humor, which he exercised regularly\" -Sam Lazar, D.C. later opened office in Florida -Harry was administrator; Lorraine Welch was \"a disgusting person\" was pharmacist -Abner Blumenfeld, D.C. was former NYPD cop, taught students a few judo holds; developed Interstate X-ray on 42nd Street in NYC; CIC sent patients for x-rays; Michael does not recall x-ray facilities at CIC -Frances Orner, D.C. had crush on Michael -Harry Ruderman, D.C. was \"an asset to the school\" -Renato Getti, D.C. was rather vain, \"created an air of mystery about himself\" -Nat Novik, D.C. taught \"Art, Science was \"a strange one...aloof\" -Herman Nimhause, D.C., one month younger than Michael, CIC grad, still practices in NYC -Ferdinand Lustig, M.D. taught at CIC and practiced at Hotel Ansonia, second floor, Michael practiced in same building -Frank Dean, D.C. was \"erratic,\" \"unpredictable,\" \"disorganized\"; always referred to MDs as \"medicos\"; Dean opposed NCA and discouraged students from getting involved with NCA; Dean was 60-62 inches tall, powerfully built -Leo Spears, D.C. visited CIC -Michael trained and taught at CIC's evening division; when he was a student, the evening division numbered 25 students all years -Francis Regardie was a year ahead of Michael at CIC 2002 (Jan 20): e-mail from Herman Nimhauser, D.C. (hbnimhauser@earthlink.net): Thanks for communicating with me. It's a very special pleasure to be hearing from a graduate of \"COLUMBIA\". Concerning the attached photo; I can only identify-and only vaguely- Dr Orner. A brief history of my attendance at Columbia will account for this. I was a night student as of Sept. 1940 till early 1943 when I was inducted into service WW11; discharged March 1946. Due to family responsibility, I did not get back to night session at Columbia until mid 1948. Dr MIKE was instructor at this time; graduating June 17, 1950. Dr Mike was great instructor, was and is a fabulous person. I am a semi-retired Chiropractor; have not kept in contact with Columbia graduates and do not have any news to convey to you. Thanks again for contacting me, and I look forward to receive you Emails. ALL THE BEST. DR NIMMY 2002 (Feb 8): e-mail from Michael Moross DC (MCM CHEF@aol.com): Dear Joe, I just recalled another incident involving Dr. Dean, one which may illustrate another facet of that unusual man. It was about 1940 when my stepmother was afflicted with a rash that started in her feet and spread upward until it reached her scalp. It was a fungal growth that defied the accumulated medical ability to heal. Much later it was determined that the original lesion was under her big toenail, and the treatment was to remove the nail and periodically to scrape the nail bed until the body was relieved of the infestation.In the meantime, I appealed to Dr. Dean for help. Without hesitation he proposed to visit our apartment and treat my stepmother. Although the directions were quite specific, he became lost before he found us. He attempted to adjust my stepmother, but she panicked when he turned her head. He graciously made his exit, and she suffered two more years, feeling that insects were crawling on her skin. 2002 (May 7): e-mail from Michael Moross DC (MCM CHEF@aolcom): Ed Kimmel is after me to send him a copy of the file on him that you prepared. I cannot do that because my compouter failed to download the file, as it so often does. Perhaps you can e-mail a copy to him. I really don't care, but in the interest of accuracy and thoroughness, you might add to the history of the Baltimore annex the fact that I commuted to the school in its early days in order to teach some classes for Dr.Dean. It was a hardship for me, but I felt that I should help him to get the school started. 2002 (May 15): letter from Fred Barge, D.C. on Palmer College stationery (in my Barge file): Dear Joe, Yes my friend I spent some nine months at Logan Basic College of Chiropractic in 1955. My father, dissatisfied with my education at Palmer (not philosophy but technic) insisted that I have a Logan Post Grad. I was given academic credit for seven months postgraduate work in Logan Basic Method. My father took H.B.'s work, I am not sure when but I think after his stroke. He utilized Logan Basic with his one good hand. I too always used Basic in my practice. With Dad, as a young man, I attended the IBTRI conventions, often held in Stevenspoint, Wisconsin. Both Dad and I had numerous spinal correction trophies. So I knew Vinton, Casey, Coggins, and Montgomery as a boy and they were my teachers in 1955. There were two presenters in chiropractic philosophy (other than BJ) that I truly was impressed by; they were Logan and Napolitano. Later I came to appreciate Janse. The dramatic, dynamic presentations of Vinton Logan remain stamped into my recall even today. I have enclosed some stuff from my archives, when you are through with it simply send it back as soon as you can. I'm impressed by your Barge file - yes perhaps when time permits, I'll collaborate with you. I have often \"Thot\" about an autobiography. Sincerely,... Fred H. Barge, D.C., Ph.C. Professor of Philosophy Special Advisor to the President 2002 (May): JACA [39(5)] includes: -letter to the editor from Charles N. Cooper, D.C., VAR, PAR of Baltimore (p. 26): More on Scoliosis After reading your scoliosis article (JACA, February 2002; 39(2): 8-16), I am compelled to respond to the antichiropractic inferences, sentiments, and comments of the medically misguided statements expressed by [Drs.] Garges, Banks, and Triano, all of whom demonstrate the chiropractic sight of a clam and the medical sight of an eagle. I entered the chiropractic profession in 1952 and was personally instructed and trained from 1952 to 1954 by Dr. Frank Dean, dean of the Columbia College of Chiropractic, located in Baltimore, Maryland. Dr. Dean's instruction and training included the diagnosis, management, treatment, and correction of spinal scoliosis. I was taught that the treatment and correction of scoliosis was based on correcting the keystone or foundation vertebra and the apex of the scoliosis.During my professional career, I have successfully treated tens of thousands of minor and major scoliotic spines, and not one case I treated ever required bracing or corrective surgery. I treated scoliosis empirically and pragmatically without the benefit or dependence on double- and triple-blind studies, sham adjustments, peer reviews; bibliographic, scientific, literature support; or genetic DNA confirmation. There is more to chiropractic care and results than the controversial article you published on scoliosis and though [Drs.] Garges, Banks, and Triano have the Voltairian privilege of expressing their opinions and views, your article should have focused on and emphasized the chiropractic benefits and results in the treatment and correction of scoliosis of the spine through chiropractic adjustments. 2002 (Oct 3): e-mail from Donald J. Maher, D.C. (DJMDC@aol.com): I just read the article in DC about Dr. Frank Dean. In the article was a picture of the school (fig 4). The caption for the article stated CIC 1921-1959. I began my chiropractic education on Sept 10 1973 at CIC. At the time I believe the two brownstones pictured were CIC. The entering class of 9/73 was the beginning of the resurgence of Chiropractic education. While all upper classes had all their class in those two brownstones, the new freshman class probably close to 100, had it's classes away from the main campus on the third floor of a parochial school on either W 69th or 70th street and the instructors would come to the class. It was divided into sections A & B. I had Dr. Dean's wife, Dr. Loraine Welch Dean, as a teacher that first semester. She also had a disdain for MDs. Right after her untimely death from a commuter accident. Dr. Napolitano announced that CIC and NYIT were forming a union and that the sciences courses would be taught by the faculty of NYIT. The entering Jan 74 class would begin matriculation at the Long Island campus. Our class would be the only class given the option of transferring to the long Island campus. The advantage to transferring was that you would be able to sit for the NY board exam. In 1973 if you wanted to practice in NY State you had to graduate from National College. I don't think many students transferred from my class to the Long Island campus. After my class graduated I believe that the brownstones became a satellite clinic in the city. I am not sure if at some point before my starting class graduated, all classes were not moved to the Long Island campus. After two semesters at CIC I transferred to National College. 2002 (Oct 4): e-mail from Donald J. Maher, D.C. (DJMDC@aol.com): Donald J. Maher DC 181 Hartman Bridge Rd. Ronks PA 17572-9700 Or Box 250 Strasburg PA 17579-0250 In the heart of the Amish country I don't think I have anything other then two certificates from CIC that state I made the dean's list for the two semester's I was in attendance. They are signed by Martin Greenburg and Ernest Napolitano I will scan them to jpeg's and send them if you want. As I stated I left after two semester's. I viewed the experience at CIC maybe a little differently then a lot of my classmates. The year prior to chiropractic school I was hired to teach chemistry in the Pa State University system for a woman who was on sabbatical. While there I got involved in some research and unfortunately I disproved the Ph.D. that headed the project. He had several grad students that had already published. I felt bad for him. I was being groomed for a Ph D slot at Duke in forensic chemistry by another Ph D in the department but I had to publish my data. The research project director was a nice man. I really liked him and I did not want to do that to him so I didn't publish.I sort of had to change directions and I went toward heath care. The DO school in Phila. would accept me but their class was full by May so I had to wait another year. My father who at the time was a pharmacist in NE PA said why not try chiropractic school. \" There is a Dr. now in town that is really helping a lot of people\". My father had done very well in the drug business and he was able to offer 100% financial support. I did know much about chiropractic school education but CIC was on the east coast so that is where I applied so I could be close to home and I had an aunt in NJ near the city where I could live to help keep down expenses. When I applied in May I was accepted immediately. My experience at CIC is through the eyes of someone with an MS in chem. and a dissertation short of an M Ed in biology, which I never had time to complete. Most of the faculty at CIC were chiropractors who practiced in the NY or NJ area and came to the college several days a week and taught two or nine hrs per week to sections A & B of the freshman class. The DC's that had just graduated and were trying to teach just read from the textbooks. From my prospective there was no pre-class preparation. Most of my peers were younger and had only the basic college courses necessary to get into Chiropractic College. Most didn't know the difference. So for the most part I keep my thoughts to myself. The general feeling conveyed was that you don't really need this stuff anyway. You just need it to pass the National boards, which at the time were composed of two parts. There were older instructors as well. Dr Lorraine Welch Dean taught histology to the freshman. She would say things like \"This cell is as flat as a flitter\" She was very negative toward medicine. Perhaps this was because of the old wounds her and her husband suffered at the hands of political medicine. I think she was a very brilliant woman who had left a promising academic career to marry Dr Dean. It appeared that because of her decision she was subject to ridicule in her early days that left her very bitter. She often referred to, I think, her cousin a famous microbiology who had discovered the bacteria \"Clostridium Welchii\". She referred to most of the elite of the medical profession as those SOBs. She did not use that exact terminology but you knew what she meant. Anyway, In her class it didn't matter what you got on the tests. Your grade was going to be based on how well you were able to compile a scrapbook filled with recent newspaper articles about medical failures and screw-ups. This scrapbook was to be used in your waiting room. Midway through the semester she passed on. Oh, I am sure you know that Dr. Dean had a school in Baltimore. There is a local chiropractor whose father attended that school and he may have attended the Baltimore School as well. He might have some memorabilia of interest. His name is Lester A. Blank 1116 Simmontown Rd. Gap Pa 17527-9690 There were other older faculty like Dr. Thomas Whitehorn a very eloquent gentleman who taught philosophy and the history of Chiropractic. He was taught by BJ and reminisced about the good days, alot. He once stated that he had a relative who like Havery Lillard went deaf. He had just graduated and could not wait to give this relative an adjustment. He got off the plane when to this relative's house and adjusted this person using HIO and their deafness went away. The next day he adjusted them again and the deafness came back and never left. He was very serious when he told the story and it was hard to tell if he had a gleam in this eye. He taught from a textbook by Stephenson on philosophy. The first semester we covered half the freshman text. I remember things like the \"wet man\" \"dry inductive reasoning vs. deductive reasoning. It seemed like the philosophy was constructed in such a way as to validate chiropractic\". However, it didn't seem that it followed the constructs of a philosophical argument. Anyway most people bought it. I didn't and Dr. Whitehorn knew it. He once said to me, Maher it is too bad you are so smart (intelligent) if you were not you would be a good chiropractor. You were not allowed to question the instructors or take issue with controversial doctrine. If you did you were looked at as a heretic.Even when the statements uttered were in direct contradiction to accepted facts. There was a Dr. McDonald that taught neurology. He was a no nonsense guy. He knew his material and you were expected to learn it as well. He came to class one day with a journal called \"Annals\" It was a Swiss publication. It had articles in it by members of the Swiss Chiropractic association. I remember articles by Dr. Sandoz. The articles were about spinal dysfunction and distortion patterns. I asked Dr. McDonald were I could get a copy of this journal. He did not know for the journal was on loan to him. I asked if there were other similar publications, but he did not know. I would have to sum up the education experience at CIC in the following manner. We will teach you philosophy to valid your chosen profession.. We will teach you all the chiropractic techniques just as good as the other chiropractic colleges. We will teach you all the basic science information necessary to pass the National boards. We will teach you as good as all the other schools. One day an instructor in class said \"don't worry about that, you don't want to learn to diagnosis because if you diagnosis your patients, you will wind up referring them to MDs and you will not have a practice. I liked Dr. Napolitano. It seemed he was a man with vision and was attempting to make CIC a first class academic institution. I think he had a lot to overcome to realize his dream. At the end of the first semester a student in the other freshman section transferred to National College. The general feeling of the Columbia administration was, if you feel you have to transfer don't go to National because they will teach you to be a medical doctor. In early spring there was a week break. It was timed to be a week before the National board test. There were special cram sessions that week for the test applicants in the classrooms. I will phrase the following this way. It was rumored that a student organized the test applicants. The applicants were all to memorize five specific questions on the test. This was to be added to the growing National board database. I didn't know much about National College. But I heard at it had just received Midwest Regional Accreditation. I knew what that meant. During the week when the upper classmen were cramming for the National Board, I hopped on a bus for Chicago. Ron Beideman met me and he showed me around the school. I saw the cadavers, the cine-radiology lab for motion picture imaging and the x-ray physics lab with its program learning x-ray set. I was told that a Dr. Joe Howe was able to get one of the first six sets. The other five went to medical schools. In NY at the time chiropractors were not allowed to X-ray below L-3. Student full spine clinic x-rays were shot at a doctor's office in NJ. It appeared that there was a quest for academic excellence that was lacking at CIC. In fact it appeared the opposite was true a CIC. Before leaving National College I walked into Dr. Himmel's office who was academic dean and immediately transferred institutions. I learned more about chiropractic in the first month at National then I had learned the entire time at Columbia. Early courses at National College focused on biomechanics and distortion patterns. My time at Columbia was spent on philosophy and practicing on the speeder. A device to develop proficiency in toggle adjustments. While I was a National I would relate to friends what I learned at CIC. They didn't have a clue as to what I was taking about. I did find a copy of Stephenson's text in the library. It seems that sometimes you have to experience things first hand to know what is really going on. What I have just written may not add a lot to the historical background of CIC. But you did ask me to share my recollections of CIC. I noticed that you copied my e-mail Jim Winterstein. I am going to continue a little bit for the benefit of Dr. Winterstein. I never met him because he had just sold his practice in West Chicago and movedto Florida and when he came back I was gone. I was given some advanced standing by Dr. Himmel and began to pull down extra courses and somehow finished National in 8 semesters. With the two semesters at CIC I met the class hour & semester requirements for all US Boards. While at National I also volunteered my time to help Joe Howe with his research for the US Bureau of Radiological Health and prepared the cadaver that was used to take the final measurements. The cadaver was specially sealed to keep from drying out to approximate tissue equivalency but yet not interfere with x-ray absorption of the imbedded TLD chips. I also helped a Dr. Awad who was doing animal subluxation research but he was bleeding the school for research monies. He presented some of my data at a Colorado Spinal biomechanics Conference and my data also appeared in his article written for JMPT. After he was let go, Dr Janse asked me to teach the research techniques to Dr Hun Lin Lin. He did not like the preliminary study. I think the animal studies were dropped. I heard through the grapevine that Dr. Janse was concerned that Dr. Awad was going to continue his research at John Hopkins. The student who had transferred to National after the first semester was Mike Nelson. Upon graduation he set up practice in Baltimore. At National we became very close friends. Once day I went to visit him he said he had seen Dr. Awad in Towson and he followed him. He ran a clinical lab. I went to visit Dr. Awad. He had set up a small clinical lab that employed his wife and son and catered to local physicians. I guess he never got is Hopkin's appointmernt. My last two clinic semesters I developed a program learning tutorial for the rad. lab. Joe Howe taught the theory part of the x-ray physics course, I ran the laboratory part of the course. I'd like to think Joe Howe considers me a friend. Before I graduated Dr. Janse asked me to stay on as faculty but I was in the process of buying a practice. At Christmas breaks and summer breaks I would come back to NE Pa. and spend time in Lou Sportelli's office. He thought enough of me to recommend me to a colleague that was selling his practice. With my father's help I bought it. I have been here ever since. I was in school from 1st grade to the age of 30 either on one side of the desk or another. It was time to do something else. I have not published or tried to make a name for myself in the profession. The experience of CIC has been invaluable. It has given me insights into this profession that few of my colleagues can appreciate and especially when it comes to the straight chiropractic mentality. I will leave with a quote from a teacher I had the pleasure to know at National which vividly demonstrates the differences in education. \"Philosophy is the ignorant man's explanation of misunderstood phenomena.\" I think that is an appropriate quote Donald J Maher DC PS I also noticed that you copied my e-mail to jtaylor4 who in turn copied it to fnicchi@nycc.edu I may be at NYCC in mid November as a proctor for the national board practical. I put in for Life and NYCC but have not yet received final confirmation. 2002 (Nov 25): handwritten letter from Charles N. Cooper, D.C. in Baltimore: Keating, I continue to view your Chiropractic writings with a jaded eye and remain your critical conscience. According to Dr. William Adolph, acting dean of CCC during Dean's absence, on 11/25/2002 at 3:30 PM; Bill told me all teachers at CCC were paid $10/hour. I know that some of the teachers refused any pay, feeling that they were donating their time and knowledge to the advancement of chiropractic and their students. You still have failed to recognize and learn that Chiropractic, in its early days, was comprised of a different breed of humanitarian.For a man who prides himself on science and unequivocal facts and being a punctilious perfectionist, your writings and information reminds me of an Antarctic crevasse. 2002 (Dec 2): e-mail from Jim Winterstein DACBR (jwinterstein@nuhs.edu): Dear Joe. Joe Allen was an interesting man but I was always surprised that he was at Columbia which was really a straight institution and Nappy was pretty narrow too. Allen wrote a number of anti-polio vaccine articles in dynamic Chiropractic back in the mid sixties. He made a pretty good case but I wonder how he rectified that stance with his pro-science stance. Jim 2003 (May 15): e-mail from Andrew Harris (aharris@umdnj.edu): Dr. Keating, I found on the web your article on \"The Mysterious Dr. Dean\". I presume that you are an historian of chiropractic in the US. My great-uncle (Louis S. Siegfried) was involved in several schools of chiropractic in NYC, starting with training at the NY School of Chiropractic in 1917. At one time he was head of the Metropolitan School. I have very little information about his activities other than what is reflected in his diary, which includes discussion of his interactions with various people in the chiropractic world at that time, and of some of the legal battles with the MDs. In addition to being a chiropractor he was also a printer; he was the publisher of \"The Medical Trust Unmasked\" by John Spivak in 1929, and of a periodical called \"The Quest (Against Vaccination and Cruel Vivisection) published from June 1926 to May 1932. He died in 1932 of a kidney infection in NJ, having moved there to avoid having to vaccinate his children. Can you direct me toward an article or book that would introduce me his involvement in the early years of chiropractic in NYC, or other information regarding him? Thank you for your time.
