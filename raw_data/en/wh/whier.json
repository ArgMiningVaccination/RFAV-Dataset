There are three very distinctive geographical regions, namely the High Andean plateau, the region of the valleys, El Chapare, and the tropical, Amazonian region. Due to the ecological diversity and individuality of each of these regions, there are distinctive medicinal plants growing in each one of them. There are over 2000 documented indigenous medicinal plants utilised by traditional practitioners who live and work in these regions. Hence, there are Amazonian plants utilised by the native peoples of the Beni and Pando, plants from the valleys utilised by natural practitioners in the Chaco and Chapare, and plants utilised by the largest known traditional Shamans of Bolivia, the Kallawayas. The Kallawayas The Kallawayas' harmonic medicinal practices are rooted in the Tiahuanacu (400-1145), the Mollo (1145-1435), Inca (1438-1532), Spanish (1532-1825) and Bolivian Republic (1825-1997) periods of this region of the Andes. The Kallawayas come from a region called Charazani, in the Province Caupolican of the Department of La-Paz, in Bolivia. This extends to the shores of Lake Titicaca, the highest in the world, where - as legend has it - the first Inca couple, Manco Kapac and Mama Ocllo emerged on the island of the Sun and whose heirs brought forward the Inca Empire. The Kallawayan blend of magic and knowledge has tapped into the healing powers which Mother Nature offers to mankind. There are mentions of the Kallawaya healers in the writings of the Spaniard Garcilazo de la Vega, after the discovery of America, in his \"Comentarios Reales\" (Royal Commentaries) states: \"these herbalists, the in Aymara means 'carriers of medicinal herbs', are very knowledgeable in the science of Medicine\". The fame of these noted herbalists must have been such that the Incas called their territory Qollasuyo to indicate that in those lands lived the Qolasiris or Qolitis (Healers) or perhaps from the lands where you could obtain Qollas or medicines. Either way the name Qollas must have been intimately related with their medicinal practices and the trading of medicinal herbs in which the Kallawayas were engaged. The fact that the Kallawayas were able to live amidst the Inca Nobility as a result of their trade, must have given them the opportunity to become familiar with many of their customs and esoteric practices: amongst other things they must have learned the sacred language, which was exclusive to Royalty and hence the historians of the time were unable to decipher it and they could only report that the Kallawayas had their own dialect which was utilised to discuss confidential matters. These medicine men travelled far and wide through South America, after each pilgrimage they gathered together in their lodges to exchange news and new procedures which they had developed during their travels. These meetings were real social events which were only open to members of their community or llajta. In this same way they incorporated in their pharmacopoeia all the medicinal plants which were brought by the Spaniards to Latin America. Currently there are about 50 Kallawaya practitioners, and they have the knowledge of and ability to utilise some 900 indigenous medicinal plants. Kallawayas view nature as a cycle of fluids with a certain and necessary asymmetry of hot and cold and wet and dry that causes a pendulum-like movement. Implicit to this are hydraulic dynamics in which liquids are concentrated or distilled by centripetal forces and dispersed to the periphery by centrifugal forces. Health is the cycle of fluids and semifluids (water, air, blood and food) all of which, with the exception of blood, are distilled into secondary fluids (mucus, bile, sweat, urine, gas, milk and semen) and semifluids (faeces and fat). With the exception of fat, all of these need to be eliminated regularly and become toxic if they accumulate. Disease is synonymous with interrupting the cycle of circulating blood distilling fluids and eliminating waste products (which are recycled). Hot/Cold and Wet/Dry are important factors because they influence the fluidity of this hydraulic cyclical system. AIR is an invisible fluid substance that provides breath to all living things. People, plants and animals share in this fluid which has a unifying principle between them. Breath is associated with the wind, wayra. This can cause mal de aire with muscle and nerve disorders such as Bell's palsy and muscle cramps. These are cold disorders which must be cured by hot treatments with steam baths, compresses and stimulating herbs such as Aniseed. Air concentrates in the sonco (respiratory and circulatory centre), and disperses uscles, causes contractions and paralysis. Blood orwayar is the life principle, and FAT wira is the energy principle. Fat is carried by the blood to parts of the body and in this system a person with dark coloured blood is described as having fatty blood. In the sonco fat is separated from food by the force of the blood coming together in an inward spiral of centripetal movement, this force then reverses itself in an outward movement and disperses the fat and blood to the parts of the body. The same illness may have dual origin, according to the principle of contradiction of opposites, that is it may come from the heat or the cold. For example a cough may be caused by heat or cold, if the cause is caused by cold, the treatment is with hot herbs such as vira vira, cedar etc, however if the cough is caused by heat, then one should drink cold herbs such as linseed, ices and so on. One of the ways of establishing whether the origin of the cough is heat or cold is the result obtained by the treatment with the various herbs, the other is establishing the circumstances surrounding the onset of the condition. Medicinal Plants I will now describe a brief selection of some of the numerous medicinal plants commonly used in traditional medicine in all regions of Bolivia: Albahaca English name: Basil Botanical name: Ocimum micranthum Willd. Introduced in America during the Spanish conquest, this hierbita -- this aromatic herb - with its wealth of healing and medicinal qualities, spread vastly and now grows wildly throughout the Amazon region of Bolivia.

Kar\u00e9 Botanical medicinal herb has medicinal priorities known world-wide and grows extensively in the Bolivian regions.

This small shrub grows up to a height of 25 metres, and today it is one of the most popular herbal medicines requested world-wide. The infusion of a teaspoon of dry, chopped cat's claw bark (twice the amount is required for fresh bark) in 1 litre of water, is a very good remedy for the treatment of growths in the uterus, stomach and lung. This decoction should be done on low heat, for a period of 30 minutes, allow to cool and sip throughout the day. According to existing information this infusion has a very good immune stimulating action which helps to prevent HIV from progressing to full-blown AIDS. The infusion of 1 heaped teaspoon of powdered cat's claw root in 1 litre of slowly boiling water for 30 minutes is diuretic, sudorific and depurative of the blood. It should be sipped as a cold refreshment during the day to keep blood cholesterol levels low. This infusion is also very useful for boosting the immune system, to prevent bad circulation and helpful with pre-menstrual syndrome. Cat's claw is a good anti-diabetic and taken regularly it can help to prevent the onset of allergies, arthritis and disorders associated with an inefficient immune system. The information provided in this feature is only a minute part of the incredible wealth of the traditional herbal and Shamanic practices of Bolivian indigenous healers, of which the Kallawayas are the most prominent group. Their system of healing also encompasses a humoural theory which in addition to the four classical humours of the Greek (that is phlegm, blood, black bile and yellow bile), add ether to complete the way the practitioner looks at the patient. A great deal of importance is also placed on the nine levels of the soul and Mother Earth, the Pacha Mama which forms an integral part of the healing ceremonies. It is worthwhile to mention that some of the medicinal plants which I have described - such as cat's claw and basil - are, of course widely available in the U.K., while some of the others may be available in the future, as they are beginning to be ecologically marketed.
