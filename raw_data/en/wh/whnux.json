Roots and Ritual rescues and re-homes bees from all over the West coast of Florida. We do not farm our bees, choosing instead to put the health of the bees first. We don't sell straight honey because we take very little honey from our hives. Leaving them enough honey to thrive, we never have the need to supplement their nutrition with sugar. Equilibrium of hives and lives. ayahuasca SACRED SPIRITUAL TALISMANS Ayahuasca is derived from the South American Quechua words \"aya \" meaning soul or spirit and \"huasca\" meaning rope or vine... It's the \"vine of the soul\". Often compared to an umbilical cord that links us to our true selves. When combined with other sacred plants, Shamans create the entheogenic brew \"la Medicina\", a psychoactive medicine used to communicate with the world of spirits. The ancient Ayahuasca recipe has been passed down for millennia and is used for profound healing, personal evolution, divination and as a guide to enlightenment. Our Roots and Ritual Ayahuasca vines are grown, nurtured and harvested for talismans at our home in Tampa, Florida. All created in a sacred space by hand from harvest to finish. Wear and meditate "}
