Background Complementary Medicine (CM) or Integrative Medicine (IM) is when alternative medicine is used together with functional medical treatment, in a belief that it improves the effect of treatments. Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) is the term for medical products and practices that are not part of standard medical care. People with cancer may use CAM to: Help cope with the side effects of cancer treatments, such as nausea, pain, and fatigue, Comfort them and ease the worries of cancer treatment and related stress, Feel that they are doing something to help with their own care, Try to treat or cure their cancer. Complementary medicine is used along with standard medical treatment but is not considered by itself to be standard treatment. One example is using acupunct ure to help lessen some side effects of cancer treatment. Integrative medicine is an approach to medical care that combines standard medicine with CAM practices that have shown through science to be safe and effective. This approach often stresses the patient's preferences, and it attempts to address the mental, physical, and spiritual aspects of health. Alternative medicine is used instead of standard medical treatment. One example is using a special diet to treat cancer instead of cancer drugs that ar e prescribed by an oncologist. Types of Complementary and Alternative Medicine Scientists learn about CAM therapies every day, but there is still more to learn. Some of the therapies listed below still need more research to prove that they can be helpful. If you have cancer, you should discuss your thoughts about using CAM with your health care provider before using the therapies listed below. People may use the term \"natural,\" \"holistic,\" \"home remedy,\" or \"Eastern Medicine\" to refer to CAM. However, experts often use five categories to describe it. These are listed below with examples for each. Mind-Body Therapies These combine mental focus, breathing, and body movements to help relax the body and mind.

Imagery: Imagining scenes, pictures, or experiences to help the body heal. Creative outlets: Interests such as art, music, or dance.

Herbs and spices such as turmeric or cinnamon. Special foods or diets. Manipulative and Body -Based Practices These are based on working with one or more parts of the body.
