In HEAL the ingredients are carefully selected, so that our gut and our body gets optimised natural nutrition. The high fiber content creates happiness in every single cell ! You can have HEAL with you and just shake it with water whenever and wherever or you can make it from home with delicious dark berries, greens or almond milk and drink it on the way to work.\" Marianne Palm, Editor Sund Forskning ( Healthy Science ) and Director of Institute of Biological Medicine. \"I have tested the product HEAL and am impressed about the quality, the nutrient content and the fact, that it is both organic, gluten free, soy free, lactose free and vegan. It is obvious that a lot of knowledge and careful consideration went into developing this product. For me HEAL is particularly well suited for elderly picky eaters and cancer-patients. Unfortunately the price can be a barrier for some.\" Anette Harbech Olesen, Author and Health Debater, Madforlivet.com \"Laser Aps is a medical/ doctor clinic working with orthomolecular medicine. We therefore see a lot of patients with difficult autoimmune diseases. One of the challenges for these patients is lack of appetite, which makes it hard for them to keep their weight, get sufficient energy and nutrients into their bodies, in order to function daily. That is why we have decided to work with HEAL, so that we can offer our patients this fantastic product, as a part of their daily diet. Since we started this collaboration, we have seen an increasing interest and some happy patients with the feedback that it is a great help in their daily lives\" Peter Winther, Nutritionist , Coaching and Laser operator. \"I personally love preparing food myself, however, there are days when there is no time , or I simply don't feel like cooking. Those are the moments when I really appreciate HEAL as a quality meal replacement, which is complex and so easy to make. I usually mix HEAL with water, green leaves and fresh fruits. I like to bring it with me for business meetings or when I travel. I love that HEAL is made of so many natural raw organic ingredients, with their natural enzymes and vitamins, and the fact that it doesn't contain any additives is so important for me with my background.\" Eva H\u00e1jkov\u00e1, Specialist Functional Medicin \"HEAL has helped me with heaviness which I used to feel after meals. I was running out of ideas what to eat during the day to avoid this fatigue. HEAL has become an integral part of my diet, I normally have it either for breakfast or lunch. I have to say that since I've been using HEAL regularly, I have so much more energy, I feel much better overall and I no longer know what food coma feels like. The meal is ready in a few moments and I can be sure I'm giving my body everything it needs.\" Martin Fafl, tennis coach \"As an active athlete, the thing I appreciate most about HEAL is the nutritional balance, high amount of fibers and the fact that all the nutrients come from superfoods. HEAL has become part of my training preparation for both American football and fitness. I often use it during the busy work days, when I barely have time to pause for a moment. A quick HEAL shake doesn't disturb my work flow and I don't feel the tiredness which I would normally feel after a heavy meal. It's actually the opposite, I'm full of energy and I'm more concentrated.\" Ladislav Jen\u00edk, personal fitness trainer \"I am a very active and busy person, and I am always looking for healthy food options I can have on the go. What I love the most about HEAL is their emphasis on organic plant-based ingredients and their mission to improve the impact we have on nature and the environment. I usually drink HEAL for lunch and it leaves me feeling full and great about myself for many hours after.\" Patrick, Copenhagen \"One of the many reasons I love having HEAL for lunch or dinner is the fact I know it is full of very nutritious vitamins and minerals I would most likely not be able to get in my system daily. I also appreciate the pleasant taste of grains and fruits. I was very surprised with how long HEAL keeps my energy going as well.\" Fozhan, Rotterdam \"I am an investment banker and work a lot. For me HEAL is extremely convenient. I am not vegan nor vegetarian myself, but I want to eat healthy, which can be quite a mission - especially during hectic lunch breaks. I drink HEAL during my work meetings, and I am left feeling full and very good about myself\" Jessica Brown, London "}
