But yesterday, for the first time, I incorporated the guided visualizations and it was MAGICAL. I found myself in a floating state of mind. I am currently suffering with jet-lag which doesn't do much to help my anxiety. But after my treatment/session yesterday a whole weight had been lifted from my head. I instantly felt calm and back in control of me. And even now, 24 hours later, I can still picture my little dude sitting by his tree with his colored stones smiling at me and it fills me with happiness and strength. Thank you I started off by buying the aura sprays as I use that a lot in the work that I do as a Doula and now I have tried a few creams, e.g. the moisturiser and the jojoba oil They are wonderful value for money as they last a long time, and I will be ordering more As Time Goes By as I am completely taken in by the amazing service and care that I have been given. I recommend anyone to buy all the products here as they are genuine and wonderful people to deal with. Don't ask me how or why this product works. All I can say is it is amazing! I used it constantly in the midst of a toxic relationship and it enabled me to feel strong and able to leave with my own persona still intact. I am continuing to use it now during a time of acceptance and healing. I love this spray! Have tried other makes of aura sprays... no comparison to vitali-chi Made with love is the secret ingredient I think Hello there. I am seeing Jill Jesson currently. I have been working with her weekly since September, 2022. But it's almost time for me to try it alone . I am an over-thinker. I have relationship OCD. I am an over-giver. My parents weren't available to me from the moment I was born therefore I don't feel worthy of love. And therefore when people come into my life I have to seek an unhealthy amount of reassurance that they love me and will stay. Jill and I have done a lot of work on me being able to be peaceful in my relationship of 4 years. In the beginning I was in such a bad and lonely place that I decided I would do whatever this woman told me to do as she was recommended to me by someone I trust and have a lot of respect for. And it's working. It's not perfect. But I feel more in control of me and my thoughts than I ever have. I am learning to love and trust myself. And I'm learning to shut my mouth I have used super eze gel on aches and pains and most recently arthritis on my feet and hands and it instantly makes it feel better. I recently hurt my back and using this my back felt better within a couple of days also on a shoulder injury. Use it often and it does work. Very happy with this product. I have used this face mask a few times and it is so lovely and light and smells lovely and not overpowering. I leave it on overnight. You don't even notice it and my skin feels so silky smooth in the morning. It lasts as you only need a small amount so is good value for money. I have loved all the Vitali-Chi sprays that I have bought. It's nice to have another one with a refreshing scent which kick starts your day. Fantastic products, brilliant for gentle removal of make up and finish off with the toner from the anti ageing range. My skin feels and looks great. Highly recommend these products. Pleased so far though not just as good "}
