All in good fun. So i was scrolling fb reels and came across her video where she is suggesting not to have gallbladder removed at any circumstances. Then she goes on saying that her dad had stones and then he had ayurveda meds which dissolved the stones. In this way he skipped the surgery. This makess me soo mad because my mom had to get her gall bladder removed because she had stones n tried to get the stones dissolved using homeopathy meds and guess what happened??! The stones formed into slugg and caused infection!! She was in so much pain that she was crying to die rather tolerate the pain. The doctor was scared that she would die !! This lady has so many followers in insta and she is misleading people to a path which can cause them permanent damage or death !!! Will she take responsibility of that? Idk what kind of doctor is she even!! Just wanna say to you all that never believe such \"influencer doctors\" . Please be safe. "}
