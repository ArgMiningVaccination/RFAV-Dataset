But Visaya Spa at the FCC Angkor hotel promises a selection of pleasures as befits a hotel listed earlier this year by the British newspaper The Times as one of the top places to stay in the world. The two-year-old FCC Angkor Bar and restaurant expanded its facilities two years ago with the opening of the FCC Angkor Hotel and Visaya Spa. The property is in the grounds of the former French Consulate by the Siem Reap River, and a 10-minute drive from the historic Angkor Wat temples. The 40-year-old art deco building has been converted to include 29 guestrooms and two suites, each named after a traditional Cambodian herb or spice. In Sanskrit, Visaya refers to the senses (sight, sound, smell, taste, touch, as well as thoughts and emotions). The spa is set amid the gardens and, for now at least, is limiting treatments to a select few based on a holistic approach to wellness. Treatments incorporate the use of herbs and flowers grown in hotel gardens. On the menu are massages, wraps, facials, water treatments and deluxe packages. The signature treatment is a hot-stone harmony massage (US$55), where two therapists use warm basalt stones to stimulate the lymphatic system, detoxify the body and promote inner harmony. FCC Angkor is the third in a portfolio of properties developed by Indochina Assets. The FCC Phnom Penh was the first to open in 1993, followed by the 50th Street Bar and Grill in Yangon, Myanmar. Sivara Spa Amari Emerald Cove Resort, Koh Trang, E-mail: sivaraspa@trangbeach. amari.com The operators of one of Thailand's most luxurious hotel groups, Amari Hotels has opened two new resorts and spas this year. The first is the Amari Emerald Cove Resort on the island of Koh Chang. A new flight from Bangkok to Trat, the mainland town nearest the island, and a speedboat to Koh Chang has made the island more accessible, and it looks set to open up to the luxury market. The 165-room resort with its pristine beaches includes all the facilities one would expect. The second opening from the group this year is the Amari Trang Beach Resort, another property on a little trodden stretch of land on the southern coast of Thailand. The resort has 138 rooms all with sea views. Each resort has a Sivara Spa with a treatment menu listing herbal therapies. Treatments include Thai and oil massages, herbal and fruit scrubs and wraps, and the signature Amara package, which consists of a rose foot bath, a body scrub, a 90-minute oil massage, a facial and a herbal elixir. Treatments unique to Sivara Spa are the tomato body wrap and the fruity sugar scrub containing fine sugar, carrot and fruit. Chi Spa Island Shangri-La Mactan Island Resort Cebu, the Philippines Following the successful launch of its Chi spa in Bangkok last year, the Shangri-La group has added a second spa to its portfolio with the opening this month of a spa village at its Mactan Island resort. The village will cover more than 10,000 square metres and is the first spa resort of its kind in the Philippines. The Chi philosophy stems from Shangri-La in the Himalayan landscape, and traditional Himalayan elements have been incorporated into the spa's design (Tibetan and Nepalese architectural features) next to items familiar to the Philippines, including Mactan stone and furnishings handcrafted by local artisans. Guests are well-catered for with eight garden suites for individuals; six Chi spa villas for couples; a grand spa villa, which can accommodate up to four people; and wet spa facilities. Treatments are based on the principles of Chinese medicine and Himalayan healing values with the ultimate goal of restoring balance to the body and mind. Also on offer are traditional Philippine-style therapies. Signature treatments include the mountain tsampa rub - a barley scrub originating from the Himalayas to rejuvenate and exfoliate skin; the Filipino touch therapy (known locally as hilot), and water shiatsu (watsu) to ease muscles and improve flexibility. The Spa by Six Senses Hotel Arts Barcelona, Spain Tel: 34 93 221 1000 After successfully establishing itself in Asia, the Spa group Six Senses has entered new territory, launching its first spa in Europe in March. Opened at the Hotel Arts Barcelona (part of The Ritz-Carlton group), the spa has the best of city and beach destinations - the hotel is 100 metres from the beach and a short walk from some of the city's historic sites and the Liceu Opera House. The spa, on the 42nd and 43rd floors of the hotel, commands views over the Mediterranean. Facilities include separate wet areas for men and women with sauna and steam rooms, vitality pools and ice fountains. Saunas have a window wall overlooking the sea. There is also a relaxation area and two outdoor terraces. All treatments incorporate the holistic philosophy for which the brand is renowned, with a focus on rejuvenating, revitalising and pampering the mind and body. Some treatments have been specially created for the Hotel Arts spa, including the Art of Stone therapy and the Six Senses Sensory Journey - a three-hour face and body treatment administered by two therapists. Colour therapy (chromotherapy), which is based on the premise that certain colours can promote balance and healing, is used in all treatment and steam rooms. Atisaya Spa Sheraton Laguna Nusa Dua, 'from the heart' in Bahasa, made its debut in December. The aim of the 600-square-metre spa is to provide a sensory garden and water experience, and so both feature prominently. Geisha-style garden treatment rooms and villas, and indoor and outdoor water-therapy pools are characteristic throughout. There are nine treatment rooms, including suites for couples. Traditonal Balinese traditional treatments are blended with eastern spirituality and western therapies. They include aromatherapy and colour therapy - the latter is achieved by the use of kinetic lighting. Treatments indigenous to the area using locally sourced products include the Lulur Ceremony ($700) - incorporating an ancient foot-wash ritual, an exfoliation using native herbs and spices, an aromatic flower bath, and a traditional Balinese massage using spice oils. Atisaya Spa also has three signature treatments. The Balinese massage Tui Na combines cupping, pressure point and palm pressure massage while the Karang Kitri is a revitalising facial using ingredients from the gardens of Bali. Angsana Spa and Health Club Dubai Marina, United Arab Emirates The Banyan Tree group extended its portfolio to the United Arab Emirates this year with the opening in January of the Angsana Spa on the third floor of the Dubai Marina. The spa and health club promises exclusive luxury: 11 single treatment rooms, two single treatment rooms with spa baths, a 25-metre lap pool, jacuzzi and steam rooms, a fitness centre and a juice bar. Despite its Middle Eastern location the spa remains true to its Asian origins. Treatments are based on a high-touch, low-tech approach - the human touch combined with fresh botanicals. Wraps, scrubs and facials from around the world are on the menu. The Angsana massage ($955) is a signature treatment and combines palm strokes and thumb pressure to work on the body's key pressure points to ease stress and strengthen the inner chi (energy). Therapists are trained at the Banyan Tree Spa Academy in Phuket in Thailand. Chuan Spa Langham Place Hotel, Mongkok, Hong Kong Tel: 3552 3510 The Chuan Spa, on the 40th floor of the new Langham Place Hotel, provides a tranquil retreat from the bustling streets of Mongkok. The experience begins with the spa's name: in Chinese, chuan means flowing water, hinting at the rebirth and rebalance of a person's body and soul. The spa is decorated in modern Chinese architectural style, with oriental fabrics and Chinese furniture. In keeping with its name, water features are prominent. Treatments are based on the principles of traditional Chinese medicine - the five elements, yin and yang, and jing luo, or the meridian system. The emphasis is on promoting rest, relaxation and inner well-being. Products have been created exclusively for the spa and its range of calming and healing oils and body lotions were created by Chinese traditional medicine practitioners. In keeping with the water theme, the spa offers treatments using marine-based products from French brand Thalgo. It also has a Hydrotherapy Bath ($650) that combines marine algae and aromatic essences to relieve fatigue and water retention. The list of signature treatments include three Chuan massages ($725 to $1,050), which combine traditional Chinese massage techniques with a tailor-made blend of oils to aid the restoration of balance and harmony. The Harmony massage stimulates the meridian system with acupressure techniques to induce relaxation. The Balancing massage incorporates acupressure techniques to release muscle tension and improve circulation. The Chuan Stone Therapy uses hot and cold stones to balance the body's yin and yang energies. Hot stones increase the body's circulation and strengthen the immune system by removing waste products. Cold stones cool inner heat, assist acute injury recovery and increase mental alertness. Treatments specifically tailored for men are also on offer. Six Senses Spa Elounda Peninsula All Suite Hotel, Porto Elounda Deluxe Resort and Elounda Mare Hotel, Greece Having launched its first spa in Europe in March, the Six Senses Spa group is spreading its reach across the European continent with the imminent opening of its first spa facilities in Greece. The Elounda peninsula on the Greek island of Crete, overlooking the Aegean Sea, has a cluster of high-end resorts. The six-star Elounda Peninsula All Suite Hotel is considered one of the most exclusive hotels in Greece, offering luxurious seafront accommodation, a private jetty and screenings of films in its home theatre. Porto Elounda Deluxe Resort sits on a hilltop with views over the Gulf of Elounda. Nearby is the Elounda Mare Hotel, which boasts the island's only golf club. Each hotel will have rooms offering Six Senses treatments. All treatments will be based on the spa's philosophy of offering holistic therapies that balance the senses, incorporating eastern and western techniques. The spas will offer a range of therapies familiar to all Six Senses Spa menus, including the spa brand's signature holistic massage - a technique designed by a group of specialist practitioners who use blended essential oils to calm the senses. Only pure, natural products are used in Six Senses treatments. The spa facilities are a prelude to a US$10 million Six Senses Spa which will be developed over the next year at Porto Elounda Deluxe Resort. The focal point of the spa will be a rose-coloured marble hammam (Turkish bath) offering a traditional touch to the spa experience. The 2,000 square foot facility will also include four treatment rooms (two with en suite showers), a plunge pool, a sauna and a hair salon. Angsana Spa Vineyard Vineyard Hotel, Cape Town, South Africa The Banyan Tree group takes its Asian traditions to South Africa with the opening in April of its first spa in Cape Town at the historic Vineyard Hotel. The Vineyard was built as a single-storey home in 1799 and was converted to a hotel almost a century later. Today the hotel has 173 rooms, and is set in 2.5 hectares of parkland, 15 minutes' drive from the city centre. The spa is contemporary in design with characteristic Angsana features such as soft furnishings in lime green and tangerine, and Asian artworks. Facilities include five double treatment rooms (two with steam and shower), five single treatment rooms and a specially equipped rain mist room offering body treatments combined with water therapies that stimulate the body's pressure points. These include the signature Ayervedic Rain Mist ($1,350) - a traditional Indian massage aimed at promoting blood circulation - a Rain Mist Steam, and Body Polish and Rain Shower. Other signature treatments include the Angsana massage ($822), which uses palm strokes and thumb pressure to work on key pressure points to relieve stress. In addition, the spa offers a range of body polishes, facials and beauty treatments. Like all Angsana spas, treatments incorporate the use of natural ingredients such as native flowers, fruits, herbs and spices inspired by the healing traditions of Asia. Spa therapists are trained in Thai traditions. The baths Amangalla, Galle, Sri Lanka The Aman group opened two properties in the south of Sri Lanka this year, and both were fortunate enough to escape serious damage during December's tsunami. Amangalla, within the walls of the Galle Fort, opened in February. It consists of a group of buildings built more than 400 years ago and once operated as the New Oriental Hotel. Decked out in a style reminiscent of its past, the boutique hotel has seven bedrooms, six 'chambers' with separate sitting areas, and eight suites. For those who want absolute seclusion there is also a two-storey Garden House with a private terrace, a sitting room and a pantry, and the services of a private butler. Amangalla calls its spa The Baths. There are five treatment rooms, a hydrotherapy and water massage pool, a sauna, a steam room and a cold plunge pool. In March, the group opened a second property, Amanwella, on the south coast of Sri Lanka near Tangalle, a two-hour drive from Galle. The resort is located in a coconut grove overlooking a beach. Each of the 30 suites has its own pool and terrace. Suites are set on a landscaped rise, and the restaurant is eight metres above sea level. Amanwella does not have a dedicated spa facility but some beauty and massage treatments are offered. Park Tower Spa and Fitness Tokyo Prince Hotel Park Tower, Tokyo, Japan Tel: 81 3 5400 1111 Once the domain of small Japanese inns, the traditional onsen experience is now available in the newly opened Tokyo Prince Hotel Park Tower. It is the first hot spring spa in a Tokyo hotel. The 33-storey hotel is in Shiba Park, next to the Zojoji family temple, which was built in 1598. The Park Tower Spa and Fitness is on the second basement level, although skylights provide plenty of natural sunlight. There are separate hot spring baths of 50 square metres each for men and women. Hot water drawn from a spring 1,600 metres below the hotel grounds cascades from a large stone sculpture into the shallow marble bath. Not all hot springs meet the stringent requirements necessary to call themselves onsen, but this hypotonic, low-alkaline hot spring is the real thing, bubbling up at 34.3 degrees Celsius to ease a variety of physical ailments, including muscular and joint pains, stiff shoulders, bruises, sprains, stress, digestive problems and poor circulation. For those concerned about complicated onsen etiquette, simple instructions are posted. A range of European-style facials, body massage and reflexology treatments are also available at the Strelitzia Garden private aromatherapy and spa rooms for women only. The spa and fitness centre is open to members and hotel guests, although a one-day trial of the facilities is available to others at 8,400 yen ($607). Kotoran Spa by Clarins Kyoto Royal Hotel, Kyoto, Japan Tel: 81 75 223 1234 Clarins has chosen to set up its first day spa in Asia in Kyoto, the ancient Japanese capital famous for its beautiful natural setting, exquisite arts and crafts and stunning shrines and temples. Scheduled to open on July 1 in the newly refurbished Kyoto Royal Hotel, the Kotoran Spa by Clarins will combine French pampering with traditional Japanese relaxation techniques. The hotel has an underground spring, so spa guests are supplied with its signature 'Miyabi' (beautiful) mineral drinking water. The spa burns incense by Kyoto's long-established Matsuei-do and uses it in exfoliating treatments. In addition to Clarins' treatments, the spa uses some of Kyoto's herbs and plants, such as Perilla leaf, sandalwood and pine needles, in its therapeutic treatments. In the signature 'Green Tea Treatment', Uji green tea is steamed and wrapped in cotton. The hot compress is applied to trigger points to rejuvenate the body. Other treatments include body massages, meditation, aromatherapy and scalp therapy. The decor is strongly influenced by the culture and architecture of Kyoto. Large glass windows offer panoramic views while the interior combines the traditional and modern, using a minimalist Japanese style with sleek lines, soft lighting and translucent natural tones. Water features, bamboo, stone, rice paper and Japanese stucco paint create a relaxing ambience. Introductory 'Spa Stay' packages are available from July 1 to September 30. Guests can reserve the 9/F Executive Twin guest room at 38,000 yen ($2,750) per person a night and enjoy a two-hour deep tissue massage and a healthy spa breakfast.

Spa Stay packages for these luxury suites range from 62,000 yen, which includes a three-hour spa experience, to 88,000 yen for four hours of spa treatments. The Oriental Spa The Landmark Mandarin Oriental, Hong Kong The Oriental Spa at The Landmark Mandarin Oriental hotel is due to open at the end of August and, by all accounts, is set to be the queen of Mandarin spas.

The food menu is still being finalised but the choice of dishes will be determined by their health and rejuvenation benefits. Concierge staff will also be trained to advise clients on the benefits of each dish. A line of products containing oils extracted from native Asian plants will be used in the spa's treatments. Facilities will include a wellness area comprising studios for pilates and yoga, a gym and a cafe. The group has appointed Alex Medin as yoga instructor.
