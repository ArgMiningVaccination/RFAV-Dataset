To combat this stimulation overload, why not consider turning to meditation? An ancient remedy that works wonders for modern stresses, meditation helps develop strength, clarity, and stability in our minds, allowing us to live in a more mindful, productive, and less distracted way. All you need is a quiet place and a little determination, so follow these top tips and you'll be a pro in no time! Make Time for Meditation in the Right Location It can be easy to put things off when you're especially busy, so designating a specific time and place for your daily meditation practice will help. It doesn't have to be for long - even just a few minutes can help - but consistency is key! Essential Oils to Use When you Meditate Ensure that you find a quiet place where distractions are limited and try to create a calming environment using your favourite essential oils. Keep relaxing scents such as [Frankincense](https://www.youngliving.com/en_GB/products/frankincense-essential-oil), [Lavender](https://www.youngliving.com/en_GB/products/lavender-essential-oil) and [Neroli](https://www.youngliving.com/en_GB/products/id/44501) essential oils near and apply them to your wrists and temples before starting to provide an uplifting and enlightening aroma experience. This can help you bring your focus into your body and to your senses, rather than any distracting thoughts you might be having. Seat Yourself Properly and Dress for the Occasion To ensure that your mind can focus entirely on the task at hand, it's important that you're comfortable in both where you sit and what you wear when you meditate. In terms of posture, try to keep your back straight but stay relaxed and comfortable. Try rolling your shoulders, and if you find that your muscles are tight, use a few drops of oils such as [German Chamomile](https://www.youngliving.com/en_GB/products/id/34717), [Black Pepper](https://www.youngliving.com/en_GB/products/id/34703) or [Cedarwood V-6\u00ae Enhanced Vegetable Oil Complex](https://www.youngliving.com/en_EU/products/id/380) to enjoy a wonderfully stimulating massage. When choosing an outfit for meditation, try to opt for stretchy, soft, and breathable clothing that won't pinch as you try to unwind. Clear Your Mind One of the ways to get the most out of meditation is by allowing your thoughts to pass without judgement or emotion. It can be quite tricky to master, hence why practicing is so important, but the results are so beneficial. Rather than trying to rid your mind of thoughts or blocking them out, try acknowledging how you feel and letting it go, choosing to observe your feelings without a strong emotional charge. To accompany this time of letting go and unwinding, use oil blends including [Forgiveness](https://www.youngliving.com/en_GB/products/id/34825) and [Motivation oils](https://www.youngliving.com/en_GB/products/id/34845). Rub them on to your chest or pulse points and savour their sweet and enlivening scents. Remember to Breathe Breathing is the foundation for meditation and returning to your breathing is always the way to counteract a wandering mind. To practice, close your eyes, and breathe in deeply through your nose, allowing your chest and stomach to expand as you are filling your body with fresh air. Then, exhale fully and slowly through your mouth, letting the air remove all negative energy from your body. Pay attention to the physical sensation of breathing: the cool air entering your nostrils, the expansion of your chest, and the warmth of the air leaving your body. While you are breathing, it's good to keep oils such as Lavender, [Bergamot](https://www.youngliving.com/en_GB/products/id/34699) and [Clary Sage](https://www.youngliving.com/en_GB/products/id/34708) close by, as these calming scents will ensure that your environment and surroundings are relaxed. Stick With It The changes meditation can make to your life may be subtle at first, but over time can significantly increase your inner well-being. Remember, practice makes perfect and 'perfect' is something different for everyone. Don't get discouraged or frustrated if you don't reach nirvana on your first go. As long as you stay consistent you will start to see progress and enjoy the benefits of giving your mind the TLC it needs and deserves.
