MAbs are comprised of two domains: the antigen-binding fragment (Fab) and crystallizable fragment (Fc). Despite the Tsega Solomon, Frank Delaglio, John Giddens, John Marino, Yihua Bruce Yu, Marc Taraban, Robert Brinson The clinical efficacy and safety of protein-based drugs such as monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) rely on the integrity of the protein higher order structure (HOS) during product development, manufacturing, storage, and patient administration. As mAb-based Purpose. Antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) therapeutics are an emerging class of biopharmaceuticals to treat and prevent diseases, particularly those involving \"undruggable\" protein targets. Impurities generated throughout the ASO drug manufacturing and Owen Becette, Anh Tran, Jace Jones, John Marino, Robert Brinson Nucleic acids are an increasingly popular platform for the development of pharmaceuticals to treat and prevent multiple diseases including those where traditional small molecule and protein-based drug development efforts have failed. Short oligonucleotide Owen Becette, Anh Tran, Jace Jones, John Marino, Robert Brinson Nucleic acids are an increasingly popular platform for the development of biotherapeutics to treat a wide variety of illnesses, including diseases where traditional drug development efforts have failed. To date, there are 14 short oligonucleotide Katharina Yandrofski, Trina Mouchahoir, M. Lorna De Leoz, Hudgens, Kyle Anderson, Luke Arbogast, Frank Delaglio, Robert Brinson, John Marino, Karen W. Phinney, Michael J. Tarlov, John E. Schiel Biopharmaceuticals such as monoclonal antibodies are required to be rigorously characterized using a wide range of analytical methods. Various material properties must be characterized and well controlled to assure that clinically relevant features and Bruce Yu, Marc Taraban, Katharine Briggs, Robert Brinson, John Marino The mRNA COVID-19 vaccines developed by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna represent a triumph of vaccine development. The core mRNA component of these vaccines is now almost a household name. Unbeknownst to most people, however, is that each of the two mRNA Joshua A. Imperatore, Caylee L. Cunningham, Kendy A. Pellegrene, Brinson, John Marino, Jeffery D. Evanseck, Mihaela R. Mihailescu The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic highlights the necessity for a more fundamental understanding of the coronavirus life cycle. The causative agent of the disease, SARS-CoV-2, is being studied extensively from a structural standpoint in order to gain insight Yihua B. Yu, Katharine T. Briggs, Marc B. Taraban, Robert Brinson, John Marino Biologics are complex pharmaceuticals that include formulated proteins, plasma products, vaccines, cell and gene therapy products, and biological tissues. These products are fragile and typically require cold chain for their delivery and storage Robert Brinson, Wade Elliott, Luke Arbogast, David Sheen, John Giddens, John Marino, Frank Delaglio Protein therapeutics must retain their proper three-dimensional fold without forming aggregates for safe and effective use in the clinic. Therefore, the ability to monitor protein higher order structure (HOS) can be valuable throughout the lifecycle of a Luke Arbogast, Frank Delaglio, Robert G. Brinson, John Marino Characterization of the higher order structure (HOS) of protein therapeutics and in particular, monoclonal antibodies, by 2D 1H-13C methyl correlated NMR has been demonstrated as precise and robust. Such characterization can be greatly enhanced when David Sheen, Vincent K. Shen, Robert G. Brinson, Luke Arbogast, John Marino, Frank Delaglio Protein therapeutics are vitally important clinically and commercially, with monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapeutic sales alone accounting for $115 billion in revenue for 2018.[1] In order for these therapeutics to be safe and efficacious, their protein Robert Brinson, Luke Arbogast, John Marino, Frank Delaglio Quality attributes (QAs) are measureable parameters of a biologic that impact product safety and efficacy and are essential characteristics that are linked to positive patient health outcomes. One QA, higher order structure (HOS), is directly coupled to David T. Gallagher, Robert G. Brinson, John P.

Among the challenges in generating an effective ADC is the choice of an effective conjugation site on the IgG. One common method Erik M. Leith, William Brad O'Dell, Na Ke, Colleen McClung, Brinson, Zvi Kelman Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) represent an important platform for the development of biotherapeutic products. While most mAbs are produced in mammalian cells, there are several examples of mAbs made in Escherichia coli, including therapeutic fragments.
