Some vaccines are needed by all adults and other vaccines may be required due to individual risk resulting from occupation, travel, underlying illness, lifestyle or age. Why is vaccination important for adults? Vaccination is not just for children. Vaccines are safe and protect you and those around you from vaccine-preventable diseases. As we get older, the protection we had from previous vaccination can decrease for some diseases. Getting another dose (called a booster) can increase our immunity to provide the best protection. Some adults may have missed one or more of their vaccines when they were a child. They may need to catch up and get these vaccines now. There are also diseases that are more common in adults, even healthy adults. This is why additional vaccines are needed as we get older. By keeping up to date with vaccines, adults can prevent the spread of disease to those who cannot be immunized. These include: babies, young children, pregnant women, and people with certain medical conditions such as those who have weakened immunity. In recent years, new vaccines such as herpes zoster (shingles) and human papillomavirus have become available for adults. To hear about a man's personal experience with shingles infection go to [http://www.pkids.org/video/shingles/PKIDsShinglesFullVersion-Web640x360.flv](http://www.pkids.org/video/shingles/PKIDsShinglesFullVersion-Web640x360.flv). Did you know a mother can help protect their baby from whooping cough before they're even born by getting the vaccine when they are pregnant? Pertussis vaccine not only protects the mother from illness and complications, but also passes on protection to the baby before birth. Coughing fits due to pertussis infection (whooping cough) can last for up to 10 weeks or longer. Approximately half of babies less than 1-year-old who get pertussis need treatment in the hospital. One to three deaths related to pertussis occur each year in Canada, particularly in infants who are too young to be immunized, or unimmunized or partially immunized children. To hear a families story and listen to how whooping cough sounds click on the following link [http://www.pkids.org/video/pertussis/PKIDsWhoopingCough-PertussisFullVersion-Web640x360.flv](http://www.pkids.org/video/pertussis/PKIDsWhoopingCough-PertussisFullVersion-Web640x360.flv). Vaccine Safety: Did you know it takes about 10 years of research and development before a vaccine is considered for approval by Health Canada? Vaccines used in Canada are very safe. They are developed in accordance with the highest standards and are continually monitored for safety and effectiveness. Immunizations have saved more lives in Canada than any other medical intervention!In fact, worldwide immunization prevents between 2-3 million deaths every year. Vaccines do not cause the disease. Most vaccine reactions are usually minor and temporary, such as a sore arm or mild fever. You are far more likely to be seriously injured by a vaccine-preventable disease than by a vaccine.
