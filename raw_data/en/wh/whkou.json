students to the ancient tradition of Y oga in its various form s and styles. With its vast capacity to b ring vibrant he alth to bo dy, mind, and emotions, the i ntention is for students to devel op a lifelong personal practice of yoga not only to maintain exce ptional physi cal cond ition, but also to d evelop healthy relationships with self and others. Above all, this is an activity tha t stud ents can en joy as a regular form of recreation for the remainder of their lives. Student s will participate in var ious act ivities, including the p hysical practice, personal reflection, partner exer cises, group discussi on, and classroom theor y. The physi cal aspect of yoga involves t he acq uisition an d de velopm ent of skills such as st rengt h, flexibility, cardiovascul ar end urance, balance, regulation o f ene rgy through breathing an d mentalIntroduct ion 6 Yoga 1 1, Draft, June 2010focus.

Classroom sessi ons w ill addr ess t opics such as: the e ssent ials of goo d nu trition, ethical principles (like kindness, generosity, and mutual respect), and learning experiences which empower students to becom e po sitive and purposef ul members of soci ety. Rationale Yoga i n its truest sense is a p ractice of radical transf ormation. It is an effective syst em for fostering self-care, empow ering st udent s to take char ge o f their own lives and beco me con fident , heal thy, and resilient adults. Its holistic nature also encourages respectful interactions with others and the earth. Ultimately, the main message of yoga is that we all possess goodness within and that we are all worthy of love, just as we are. When this is realized, a new sense of self-love and respect is experienced, leading to a greater connection to the sacredness of all life.

Pattabhi Jois, author of the Yoga Sut ras) Yoga 11 i s desi gned to provide st udent s with the o ppor tunity to practice yog a dai ly througho ut the co urse of the semester. As such, it is recommended that teachers of Yoga 11 deliver an asana (the Sanskrit word that translates to mean posture) practice at the beginning of each class, beginning with a gentle twenty minute practice at the b eginning o f the se mester and moving towards a forty minute class as student s progress. Daily practice sho uld focus o n breathing an d proper alignm ent of post ures, recogni zing that each student will progress i n the u nder standing o f and com fort with var ious f oundat ional post ures as they b ecom e more aw are of how their bod ies m ove t hrough and h old each post ure, and become familiar with what is proper alignment for them. Found ational post ures m ay al so be though t of as b asic post ures. Yoga 11 has i dent ified four categor ies of post ures to be introduced to and practiced o ver the co urse of the se mester - st anding p ostures, advanced postures and the refore are not to be practiced, assessed , or eval uated. One e xcept ion is dow nward-facing d og, which is likew ise considered in yoga to be a res torative posture, although challenging to be ginners at fi rst. A list of foundat ional post ures is included in the ap pendi x. Teach ers are asked to con sult this list when designing their daily practice for student s, and when selecting p ostures to workshop.Module 1: Proper B reathi ng and A sana Practi ce Yoga 1 1, Draft, June 2010 11Text box - Caut ion! It is important that teacher s be mindful of medical cond itions, injuries, or strains that student s are exp eriencing. Teach ers may not be aware if a st udent is pregnant , and shoul d always instruct to include modifications f or a var iety of cond itions st udent s coul riencing. Student s can Write refl ective journal entries to de scribe thei r experience of brea thing prop erly and how it affec ts their post ures. Create a routine o r sequ ence of flowing p ostures, put to the m usical piece o f their choi ce. In pai rs, have st udent s discuss t heir intention for the d emonst ration b y answ ering the following q uest ions: -Do you want the routine to be upb eat and exciting o r calming an d meditative? -What piece o f music would com plement your ce? -What pos tures support yo nds calm while backbends invigorate -What do you w ant the au dience to learn abo ut you from your dem onst ration? Prepare and present a partner and/ or group yoga p osture (which they can create), using al ignm ent principles and pho tograph i t for their portfolio.

The class can co-create a peer obse rvation instrument. Have st udent s reflect on their personal obse rvations o f their progress w ith this out com e ove r time. Suggestions for Learning and Te aching The sun salutation is a set of postures linking movement with breath. It comprises a flow of postures that begi ns in mountain pose and moves t hrough gent le backben ds, forward bends, standing postures, a restorative inversion, and culminates in mountain pose with ha nds at the heart center. Traditionally, sun salutations were practiced facing the s un. The sun salutation is practiced to warm the b ody an d is com monly used to be gin asana practice. The sun salutation se quence can be practiced sl owly and gent ly; over time, student s/teacher s may w ish to work towards pr acticing five of each su n sal utation, and when ready m ove t hrough the se quence at a slightly increased pace, further warming u p the b ody.

In fact, it is this aspect of yoga that sets it apart from other forms of physi cal activity. It is arguabl y the m ost important aspect of yoga, and one that should be addressed before all others. Daily practice should always begin with a focus on the breath. This will enab le student s to leave t he d aily stress of schoo l and life be hind an d be com e fully present to all that yoga has to offer. Asanas, coup led w ith the p rocess o f proper breathing is what creates a connect ion b etween the b ody, mind, and spirit. These two elements work toget her to qu iet the m ind an d en ergize the b ody, thereby activating the h ost of physi cal, mental, and emotional ben efits of yoga. \"Prana\" i s the Sanskr it term for \"breath\". In traditional yoga, the breath is known as prana - the universal life force within all of us. This energy, or life force, is central to health in many Asian cultures. Other terms include chi, and qi. CHECK: IS THERE A TERM FOR FIRST NAT IONS? In everyday life, it is common to use only the upper one-third aspect of our lungs. This kind of tension is often caused by the p ace and stres s of da ily life. Effective breathing versus this shallow kind, occurs when we breathe in such a way that engages the full capacity of the lungs to ensure that we take in enoug h oxyg en into ou r bod ies, and to release t oxins through our exhal ation. Increased oxygen intake provides w ith greater physi cal ene rgy, improves co ncent ration, decr eases an xiety, and allows for enhance d relaxation o f the b ody an d mind. Teacher s shou ld introduce breathing techni ques with reference to cal ming b reaths ver sus en ergizing breath. Three-part breathing is the m ost com mon b reath introduced within the p ractice of yoga. One o f the many positive health ou tcomes of the course is simply that participating youth become more aware of their breath. As such, the u jjayi breath is consi dered a more advan ce techni que and w hile this can be introduced as an ene rgizing b reath, the intent of this out com e is simply that student s \"br eathe\". From this, student s beco me more con scious o f their breath as they g o abo ut their daily lives and can access simple breathing techni ques that serve to reduce stress and promote relaxation.
