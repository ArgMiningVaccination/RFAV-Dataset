In this study a range of platinum(II) complexes The ligand 2,3-diaminobutane was synthesise d and resolved. The resulting platinum compounds were characterised by one and tw o dimensional 1H, 13C and 195Pt NMR experiments. Complexes dichroism (SRCD) spectroscopy. The platinum(II) complexes were tested against a ra nge of cancerous cell lines to determine their cytotoxicity. Selected platinum(II) complexes were combined with K3C6TL3 liposomes and the resulting formulations we re characterised by HPLC, DLS (dynamic light scattering), ESI-MS, synchrotron small (SSAXS), 1H Pulsed Echo (PGSE) NMR and linear d ichroism (LD). The formulations were also used in preliminary cyto toxicity assays against a number of cancerous cell lines to determine if encapsulati on enhances the activity of platinum(II) complexes. 1 CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION 1.1 CANCER Cancer is described as a genetic disease of the som atic cells.1 It is said to be caused by alterations in oncogenes, tumour-suppressor gene s and micro RNA genes.2 The onset of such genetic changes can be triggered by n umerous factors ranging from radiation (such as ultra violet radiation and ionis ing radiation) and carcinogenic chemicals (such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ) to mutagens and viruses (such as the human papilloma viruses).3 Cancerous tissue and some non-cancerous tissue divi de rapidly in comparison to most non-cancerous tissue. The spread of cancer to surrounding tissue can be limited (or stopped) by the administration of agents that d amage deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). These agents should disrupt the cell's abili ty to divide. One of the main factors that influence the cell's ability to divide is the type of DNA lesion that has occurred.4 1.2 DNA As nuclear DNA is the target of most anticancer dru gs, a thorough understanding of the structure of DNA is crucial. Accredited with th e structural characterisation of DNA, Watson and Crick's most significant discovery was that DNA is comprised of two helical chains coiled in the opposite direction .5 In general, DNA is comprised of nucleotide strands organised in anti-parallel direc tions with a The nucleotides are made up of 2 \u0007-deoxyribose sugar and one of the four purine or pyrimidine bases which repeat along the length of a phosphate backbone. The purine bases are known as guanine (G) and adenine (A), whi lst the pyrimidine bases are known as cytosine (C) and thymine (T). The purines normally pair with the pyrimidines, leading to the classic A-T and G-C bas e pairs that arise through Watson-Crick hydrogen bonds (Figure 1.1).6 2 5'CH 2 ONNO OPO OO -OH N H NH NN NCH OPO OO -O 5'CH2 O P OO -O PO OO -O PO OO -O5'CH 2 ONNN OH O H N NN NCH OH H N H PO OO -O5'CH 2 Figure 1.1 The pairing of the base pairs A-T and G-C in the DN A double helix, the pairs are held together by hydrogen bonding (shown in blue).7 1.3 METAL BASED DRUGS The impact of metal complexes in the treatment of m any ailments has been significant. This is evident with the use of metal complexes of arsenic, antimony and mercury in the treatment of bacterial infections. T he biological activity of some transition metal complexes has been explored by Dwy er and his co-workers. Among their investigations, their most significant discov ery was notably the antibacterial activity of ruthenium compounds consisting of phena nthroline ligands.8 Rosenberg and his colleagues' discovered the biolog ical potential of platinum drugs while conducting an unrelated investigation on the application of an electric field on bacterial growth. Current was passed through platin um electrodes into a broth containing Escherichia coli (E.coli ) causing long bacterial filaments to form. After assessing many of the potential causes for such a r eaction they hypothesised that this phenomena was a result of an electrolytic reaction forming a platinum salt, [PtCl 4](NH 4)2.9 C T A G 3 Upon application of UV radiation, a photochemical r eaction was induced forming and [(PtCl through the substitution of ammonia ligands.10 This led Rosenberg et al. to the biological testing of the cis and trans isomers of diaminodichloroplatinate (Figure 1.2). The cis isomer was identified as being responsible for causing the bacteria to arrange into filaments, whilst the trans isomer was noted to be ineffective on the cell gro wth processes.10 The same trend was observed in other biological ass ays, concluding that the cis isomer possessed a variety of biological activities including filamentous growth of bacteria and inhibition of DNA replication, while t he trans isomer had none of these attributes. The cis isomer is inclined to form bifunctional adducts and the trans inactive transplatin ( of metal-based drugs in the treatm ent of cancer began with cis- diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (cisplatin) which is s till among the leading drugs used in the treatment of many cancers.12 Additionally, platinum-based drugs are used to treat 50 to 70 percent of patients with cancer. The influence that cisplatin the treatment of cancer has been signif icant. However, the use of cisplatin and some of its analogues is limited due to numerous side effects, such as nephrotoxicity, gastrointestinal toxicity, peripher degraded (or metab olised) by sulfur containing biomolecules.14 As such, the search for improved, less toxic drugs continues by investigating analogues, prodrug s and transport molecules.15 4 1.4 THE EFFECT OF THIOL-CONTAINING BIOMOLECULES ON PLATINUM SPECIES Platinum species often have a high affinity for sul fur. Therefore, biomolecules that contain sulphur (such as cysteine (Cys), methionine (Met), glutathione (GSH) and (MT)) have an impact on platinum an ticancer chemotherapy.16-18 It is widely acknowledged that the anticancer effect exer ted by platinum drugs is via its interaction with nuclear DNA.18 However, while being transported around the body to the DNA target, a number of the platinum molecul es will encounter sulfur- containing biomolecules. Usually the platinum speci es that do not encounter sulfur- containing biomolecules are more likely to bind to cellular DNA and stop its replication.18-20 Cisplatin is often easily metabolised by species c ontaining sulfur: this starts from the moment of administration and contin ues during cell uptake, prior to DNA-binding and even after DNA-adducts have formed.14 Nevertheless, the role of sulfur is still debated. While sulfur is thought to be responsible for detoxification, nephrotoxicity, resistance18,21,22 and inactivation,18 recent research suggests the possibility of using sulfur-containing compounds as chemoprotectants to pacify the toxic side effects of platinum drugs. Some European countries have even approved a number of chemoprotectants for use.18,23 Experiments with cisplatin and reduced L-glutathione have revealed that degradation is rapid and the half life can be less than 10 h,24 while platinum drugs of the intercalator family developed by Aldrich-Wright et al. have been reported to have significantly slower degradation, with the shortest half life reported as 20 h and the longest reported as 68 h.25 This suggests that the family of platinum intercal ators synthesised by the Aldrich-Wright group may be capa ble in overcoming degradation in in vivo studies. 1.5 BINDING MODES The binding of drugs to DNA can either inhibit the growth of microorganisms or tumours or interfere with the expression of genes b y hindering the interactions of proteins to regulatory sections of DNA.26 There are many DNA binding modes that have been classified, including covalent binding, g roove binding and intercalation. 5 Covalent binding is characterised by the binding ov er the outer surface of the helix via interactions which are generally non-specific (and mainly electrostatic). Groove binding operates by specific groove-binding interac tions between the drug molecule and the ends of base pairs belonging to the major o r minor grooves of DNA. Intercalation occurs through the insertion of a pla nar aromatic molecule wedged between base-pairs.27 1.5.1 Covalent binding Interactions of cisplatin with DNA can be described as covalent binding.28 It has long been established that the binding interaction betwe en DNA and cisplatin is the key to its anticancer activity. The covalent binding takes place when the chlorine ligands of cisplatin are substituted by water molecules making the species a diaquated electrophile, drawn to nucleophilic centres of biol ogical molecules. This electrophilic molecule then coordinates to the N7 atoms of the im idazole rings of guanine and adenine within the major groove of the DNA double h elix. This consequently forms monofunctional DNA adducts, then interstrand or int rastrand cross-links (Figure 1.3) prevent ss-links in DNA caused by cisplatin. 6 1.5.2 Groove binding The interaction of Hoechst with DNA is ideal for th e demonstration of groove binding. This molecule is drawn to the minor groove of DNA. Depending on the grove binding molecule used, groove binding can occ ur within the major or minor groove of DNA. The properties of the major and mino r grooves vary greatly in size, hydration, electrostatic potential and position of hydrogen bonding sites. Van der Waals and hydrogen bonding (to a N atom of adenine and O atom of thymine) interactions help to stabilise groove binding withi n the confined minor groove.6 1.5.3 Intercalation The compounds investigated in this study are either known or predicted to be intercalating agents. Intercalation is described as the insertion of a planar polycyclic aromatic molecule between the layered base pairs of DNA (Figure 1.4).6 Lerman et al. were the first to come across this phenomenon, aft er conducting many experiments to study the interaction of planar aroma tic cations with DNA. Based on the results he theorised that planar aromatic molec ules could potentially affect DNA, and named this phenomenon intercalation.3,27 This interaction can occur via the major or minor groove. Typically the base pairs of the DNA are forced apart with the introduction of the intercalating species. As a res ult of this, the phosphate-sugar backbone uncoils. - Stacking is responsible for the stabilisation invo lved between aromatic ligands and nucleobases in Some well-known intercalating molecules include eth idium and proflavine.6 One of the requirements for a molecule to be capable of in tercalating is that it must be a planar aromatic system, since molecules that are no t flat or aromatic cannot insert between double stranded DNA (dsDNA). These characte ristics make square planar platinum(II) complexes which have aromatic ligands ideal to demonstrate intercalation into dsDNA (Figure 1.4). 29 7 Figure 1.4 A HyperChem molecular model of [Pt(en)(4-Mephen)]Cl 2 (green) intercalated from the minor groove of d(GTCGAC) 2 (red). The binding site T 2 and C 3 base pairs have been shown here.30 1.6 DNA Pt(II) INTERCALATORS The insertion of a planar aromatic 1,10-phenanthrol ine (phen) derivative within a region of DNA is illustrated in Figure 1.4. Planar aromatic ligands like phen and its substituted derivatives meet the requirements for i ntercalation and have been shown to interfere with a variety of biological systems w hile either unbound or bound to a transition metal.31 Platinum(II) complexes bound to chiral ancillary l igands and substituted phen intercalating ligands have been id entified to be very cytotoxic in human cancers that are resistant to cisplatin (inhe rent or acquired).32 McFadyen et al. investigated the effect of the size of aromatic li gands on the cytotoxicity of platinum(II) complexes. explored. ontaining intercalating ligands with a greater number of aromatic rings were found to be more potent, platinum(II) complexes of phen were found to be more active than the less aromatic 2,2 \u0007- bipyridine (Table 1.1).33 In particular, phenanthroline ligands be en methylated showed greater cytotoxicity while contai ned in platinum(II) complexes.34 When researching the effect of phenanthroline ligan ds and its methylated varieties on cytotoxicty, Brodie et al.30 observed the same increased cytotoxicity with 8 platinum(II) complexes containing methylated phen. Investigations revealed that the cytotoxicities of derivatives of [Pt(phen)(en)]Cl 2 demonstrated that methylation at 5- and 5,6- positions on the phen ligand significantly enhanced cytotoxicity. This was measured as the concentration required for inhibiti ng fifty percent of cell growth (IC 50) in murine leukaemia cells (L1210). However, methy lation at positions 3, 4, 7 and 8 lowered cytotoxicity in comparison to [Pt(phe n)(en)]Cl 2.35 From the cytotoxicity studies undertaken by McFadyen et al .33 and Brodie et al .34 it is understood that modest changes to a molecule (for e xample the 1,10-phenanthroline portion of [Pt(phen)(en)]Cl 2) can produce a broad array of activity.

The interaction between metallointercalators and DNA is often of a non- covalent nature, as metallointercalators usually ha ve a positive charge.34 When an intercalating compound is inserted into DNA, numero us physiological changes to the DNA occur including untwisting, lengthening and sti ffening of the DNA double helix. These changes to DNA occur in order to accom modate the intercalator. The likelihood of an electronic interaction is increase d once the intercalator is wedged within the DNA helix. Electronic interactions cause the aromatic (intercalating) molecule to orient parallel to other aromatic molec ules (such as the base pairs of DNA) by a process known as stacking. Stacking is of ten encountered with bound species followed by the separation of 10.2 \u00c5 betwee n the base pairs as a result of intercalation. Dipole-dipole interactions and - stacking are thought to electronically stabilise the intercalator wedged wi thin the aromatic, heterocyclic base pairs. The flexibility and conformation of the DNA helix can change upon intercalation. There is a great deal of structural overlap between the base pairs and 10 3.4 \u00c5 10.2 \u00c5 the intercalator after the insertion of the interca lating species. As a result of this overlap, the intercalator orients itself perpendicu lar to the DNA helix axis.36 Once intercalation occurs the DNA is expected to le ngthen: this can be assessed by an increase in viscosity and the sedimentation coef ficient. In this respect there has been an interesting trend observed with DNA binding experiments of simple monointercalators to DNA, where in the double helix alternating filled and empty binding sites appear. This phenomenon was named the nearest-neighbour exclusion principle (Figure 1.6).37 Figure 1.6 The nearest-neighbour exclusion model: normal DNA ( left) and intercalated DNA (right).38 The nearest-neighbour exclusion principle states th at for every site that is taken up by an intercalator the neighbouring site i s blocked from availability for insertion of another intercalator (this is observed as an increa se in the length between base pairs from 3.4 to 10.2 \u00c5).39 1.7 IMPORTANCE OF ANCILLARY LIGAND CHIRALITY The importance of chirality in the activity of comp lexes is apparent in the example of commercially available oxaliplatin, which possesses a 1R,2R-diaminocyclohexane (dach) ligand with two chiral centres present in th e dach molecule, allowing for three possible isomers ( R,R-, S,S-dach). Cytotoxicity testing revealed that the R,R- isomer was the most active (when compared to the two other isomers). 11 The differences are thought to arise because of the interaction of the bulky chiral Pt- dach species with chiral DNA. This variability in a ctivity supports the theory that small variations in structure can have a large impa ct on the activity of a molecule.40 Chiral molecules such as dach have been an area of great interest in the past few decades and have been incorporated into several cis platin analogues such as oxaliplatin. These analogues, with their superior a ctivity and limited toxicity, have been named second generation anticancer drugs.41 Crystallographic examination of 1,2-GG intrastrand cross-links (formed by oxaliplat in) on a DNA dodecanucleotide duplex reveal that the mode of interaction is quite similar to that of cisplatin. It differs only in the presence of hydrogen bonding th at occurs between the pseudo- equatorial N-H hydrogen atom of the R,R-dach ligand and the O6 atom of the cross- linked G in 3\u00b4 position of the DNA. It is evident f rom such experiments that the chirality of cisplatin analogues containing amine l igands with chiral centres plays a key role in its interaction with dsDNA.42 McFadyen et al. were among the first to venture to study the effec t of platinum(II) compounds with varying chiral/achiral amine [Pt(3,4,7,8-Me 2phen)(A L)]2+ caused the IC 50 values to increase (Table 1.1). The greater the number of carbon atoms present in the ancillary ligand, the lower th e cytotoxicity appeared. From the examples mentioned above, it is evident that furthe r research into the effect on cytotoxicity from modifications to intercalating li gands (such as phen) and ancillary ligands (such as dach) would be valuable.33 The cytotoxicity of metallointercalators can also b e changed with the presence of chiral ancillary ligands. Cytotoxicity studies of p latinum(II) ancillary ligands displayed a notable difference in the activity of the isomers o f the tmcp ligand. The platinum(II) complexes bound to the S,R-tmcp were more cytotoxic than those with R,S- chirality. Further research into the effect of chiral and achi ral molecules on the cytotoxicity of compounds was of great importance after these resul ts were obtained. Some research 12 indicates that metallointercalators consisting of l arge chiral ancillary ligands can prevent the complete insertion intercalating ligand into dsDNA due to steric hindrance.3 Research has revealed similar variations in cytoto xicity due to the chirality of metallointercalators (Table 1.2 ).43 Cytotoxicity studies in L1210 murine leukaemia cell lines of platinum compounds of the t ype [Pt(5,6-dimethyl-1,10- phenanthroline)(A L)]Cl 2 have been undertaken. The ancillary ligand A L is changed to either 1 S,2S-diaminocyclohexane, 1 R,2R-diaminocyclohexane or 1,2- diaminoethane (en). These complexes have displayed a notable variation in the IC 50 value, stressing the importance of the structure ac tivity relationships of ancillary ligands. Table 1.2 IC50 values obtained for three platinum drugs of the ty pe [Pt(5,6- Me 2phen)(A L)]Cl 2, where A L is the ancillary ligand S,S-dach, R,R-dach, or en (abbreviated Dendrimers The platinum drugs discussed above have drawbacks a s well as many benefits. In order to limit the drawbacks and promote the benefi ts, drug-delivery molecules can be used. Molecules such as dendrimers which can mak e the drug more soluble, increase the half life, slow the degradation of dru gs, improve specificity and localisation have been vastly researched.26 Dendrimers were named from the diverging dendritic attribute. Dendrimers also poss ess unique features such as being large in size; having a narrow size distribution; a distinct round conformation, and ease of substitutions to the end functional groups.44 Dendrimers can be derived from a range of molecules (PAM AM), polyamines, the leading dendrimers commercially available, they have a number 13 of generations and a wide variety of terminal group s (Figure 1.7).26 Dendrimers are also classified by their generations which is the n umber of repeating units enclosed from the inside to the outside of the dendrimers.45 Figure 1.7 A simulated drug embedded on the end groups of a PA MAM delivery vehicles and there are several liposomes a lready being employed in drug delivery.47 Liposomal delivery can improve the amount of drug available to a tumour site by increasing the vascular permeability and th erefore the retention.12 Bangham et al.48 were one of the first to model the liposome. The m odel system used phospholipids and cholesterol which, upon introduct ion into an aqueous environment, forced them to self-associate and form bilayers with an aqueous cavity (Figure 1.8).47,48 Figure 1.8 The general structure of a liposome. Aqueous cavity Hydrophobic head groups Hydrophilic tail groups 14 Liposomes have fast become one of the leading drug delivery vehicles with advantages such as biocompatibility, versatility (d rugs are able to be contained in the phospholipid bilayers or the aqueous cavity), prote ctive barriers from inactivating biomolecules (during transportation) and the abilit y to target drugs to specific cellular sites (minimising the undesired effects). While formulating liposomes, these advantages and many more can be optimised by contro lling the size, charge and surface properties.49 1.8.2.1 Liposomal formulations of platinum drugs Many liposomal formulations have been assessed for transport of platinum drugs including for example a liposomal formulation of ci splatin; Lipoplatin liposomes .12 Aroplatin was approved for Phase II clinical trials in patients with advanced colorectal cancer (resistant to 5-fluorouracil/leuc ovorin or capecitabine and irinotecan), with a positive response obtained.50 Macrophages of the reticuloendothelial system present a limitation to the use of liposomal formulations such as Aroplatin as they remove it from circulatio n with relative ease. Researchers soon overcame the problem by introducing sterically stabilised liposomes. This sterical stabilisation is glycol (PEG) units on phospholipid bilayers, prolonging the half life of the liposome.51 The innovation of PEGylated lipids has been termed STEA LTH\u00ae liposomes.51 Liposomal drug formulations usually accumulate in the liver ( 80-90%), whilst the STEALTH\u00ae variety stay in the blood (~ 10-15% reach the liver ) for longer periods with a circulation time of t 1/2 > 40 hours.52 A prominent STEALTH\u00ae liposomal drug formulation is STEALTH\u00ae cisplatin (SPI-77) which reached Phase II studies on non small cell lung cancer. The study revealed that STE ALTH\u00ae cisplatin has relatively low toxicity, even at high doses, when compared wit h cisplatin on its own.51 More recent research opposes the proposal of STEALT H\u00ae cisplatin being superior to the non-PEGylated variety. The research claims that STEALTH\u00ae cisplatin is limited by its slow release kinetics, making the drug conce ntrations to target cells so low at 15 any given point that the therapeutic effect is insi gnificant. As an alternative to PEGylated liposomes, (spHL-CDDP) was engineered to utilise the fusogenic properties of t he cell membrane to target the cisplatin into the cytosol. spHL-CDDP, has been qui te effective against a human lung cancer cell line.53 Other promising means of overcoming the limitation s posed by STEALTH\u00ae liposomes, such as ultrasound triggered release, h ave also been explored.54 1.8.2.2 Cationic liposomes Two decades have passed since one of the first cati onic liposomes was used for the delivery of genetic material into cells.55 This initial introduction spawned the use of cationic liposomes (also known as cytofectins or li pofection reagents) for the delivery of nucleic acids into cultured cells, anim al models and even patients participating in Phase I and II clinical trials. Pr ior to cationic liposomes, viral vectors were widely investigated, but the superiority of ca tionic liposomes is now acknowledged. As cationic liposomes are less toxic than many viral vectors and are structurally simplistic, many commercial variants a re already available and due to their simplicity in structure, they can be engineer ed specifically for many applications. Although the toxicity of cationic lip osomes are lower than viral vectors, it is nevertheless still a limiting factor, as was evident in the toxicity studies in cell cultures and animal models.56 Furthermore, a unique characteristic pertaining to cationic liposomes is the ability to specifically target the vasculature of tumours; int erestingly, this trait does not often appear in liposomes that are anionic or electro-neu tral. This phenomenon is especially true for PEGylated cationic liposomes. T he positive charge is thought to be necessary for the cationic liposomes to interact with the glycoprotein layers of the endothelium.57 In addition to the advantages mentioned above, ther e is some evidence that suggests that cationic liposomes have some selectivity for t umour vascular endothelial cells (this is known as antiangiogenic behaviour).58 From the moment an anticancer agent is administered and travels through the circulatory system, it has access to the 16 vasculature of cells that are proliferating, includ ing those of tumours. Interestingly the vasculature of tumours is significantly smaller in relation to its interstitium, so in theory the dosage required in vivo of an antiangiogenic drug must be low in comparison to some anticancer chemotherapeutics.58,59 Still, one aspect to consider is the impact of such antiangiogenic behaviour on phys iological angiogenesis such of cationic liposomes containing cytotoxic agents have been reported, wit h one study showing that paclitaxel encapsulated in cationic liposomes displ orthotropic melanoma growth in SCID mice. Paclitaxel administered in its normal Cremophor ELTM medium however, displayed little antiangiogenic behaviour in vivo .60 Recent studies60-62 have contributed to the progression of cationic li posomes such as MBT-0206 (consisting of Taxol and EndoTAG) into Pha se I trials. While cationic liposomes have been found to reach other non-cancer ous tissue in the body, it is clear they have numerous advantages: in particular, the a bility for partial selectivity to tumour vascular endothelial cells. Since the advant ages outweigh the disadvantages, it is surprising cationic liposomes have not been s ufficiently explored. The best aim for improving the success of cationic liposomes for the transport of anticancer drugs is by making modifications to their overall structu re. Suggestions in the literature for the improvement of cationic liposomes include modif ications such as PEGylation (to enhance circulation time) or by incorporating tumou r-specific ligands or antibodies on the liposome surface to increase its tumour spec ificity.58 The evolution of cationic liposomes into the field of anticancer dru g delivery appears to be promising. With further research and small modifications, cati onic liposomes could soon be in the frontier of cancer chemotherapeutics.58 The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) have developed their own patented series of cationic lip ids, developed from the common buffer 2-amino-2-hydroxymethyl-propane-1,3-diol (Tr is). This lipid mimics compounds such as glycerol, found in the backbone o f glycerol phospholipids, the most important component of the cell membrane. Tris was identified as being a unique platform for linking up to three fatty acids to amino acids or peptides to modify physiological properties. 17 Tris was initially developed for making fatty acyl drug conjugates with the aim of enhancing the therapeutic use of a number of steroi dal, non-steroidal anti- inflammatory and other pharmaceutical agents. It ha s been confirmed that Tris based lipids are able to deliver genes into the cytoplasm of cells in vitro with results equal to or better than some commercially available lipid s.63 Tris-lipids have also been shown to be cytotoxic to cancer cells. Animal studi es conducted on mouse breast and prostate cancer models revealed that treatment with the Tris cationic lipid reduced the size of the primary tumour site as well as a di stant tumour. The humoral and cell- mediated immune response was identified to be respo nsible for the reduction of the cancer (patented).64 With properties that support the disruption of the endosomal membrane, liposomes are able to release their conte nts into the cytoplasm. This project involves the incorporation of antican cer agents developed at UWS into the Tris cationic liposome invented at CSIRO to con tribute to the search for improved cancer treatment. Given the previous resul ts, it is anticipated that the incorporation of the anticancer drugs, within the T ris cationic lipid will have a synergistic effect. Cationic lipids have long been used for the delivery of genes; however their use in the delivery of anticancer dru gs of this type has not been reported. 18 1.9 PROJECT AIMS The aims of this project are: To synthesise and resolve the ancillary ligands 2 S,3S-diaminobutane, and 2 S,3R-diaminobutane.

This chapter presents the synthesis isomers of 2,3-diaminobutane acid and ninhydrin were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Sodium hydroxide pellets were p urchased from MERCK. Raney aluminium-nickel was acquired from Alfa Aesar . Sodium hydrogen carbonate and potassium hydroxide pellets were obtained from UNILAB. Buffers (pH 4 and pH 7) were purchased from Radiometer Analytical. Deute rated solvents such as dimethyl sulphoxide ( d6-DMSO) and deuterium oxide (D 2O) were purchased from Cambridge Isotopes. Solvents and analytical reagents such as acetonitrile and trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) were purchased from J. T. Baker, Labserv , Mallinckrodt Chemicals, PROANAYLS or AUSPEP. 2.2 EQUIPMENT AND TOOLS 2.2.1 Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscop y NMR spectra were acquired using either a 300 MHz Va rian mercury or a 400 MHz Bruker Avance spectrometer. Samples were prepared in D 2O or d6-DMSO and experiments were carried out at a temperature of 25 oC (for D 2O) and 35 oC (for d6- DMSO). One dimensional spectra were measured with a spectral width of 7,000 Hz, with 50,000 data points and a relaxation delay of 3 .7 s. Two dimensional nuclear Overhauser effect (NOESY), Correlation (COSY), and Heteronuclear Multiple Quantum Coherence (HMQC) spectra were obtained usin g a 3,500 Hz spectral width with 256 increments in the t1 dimension, 2048 point s in the t2 dimension and a 20 mixing time of 0.3 s. Chemical shifts are reported in parts per million (ppm) and J coupling constants are reported in Hz. Spin multipl icity is specified as: of doublets), t q m and was used to characterise ligands and metal complexes. Samples (~ 0.4 mM) were prepar ed in water. Samples were placed in 1 cm quartz cuvette and spectra were obta ined in the range 190-400 nm at ~ 25 \u00b0C. Ten accumulations were acquired with a scan speed of 500 nm.min-1, a response of 1 s, a spectral bandwidth of 1 nm, a se nsitivity setting of 100 mdeg and a nitrogen flow rate of 7 L.min-1. Using the angle of ellipticity ( \u000e, mdeg) obtained the CD spectra the molar absorptivity ( \u0003\u000f, mdeg/ M cm) was determined using Equation 1, where c is the concentration (mol.L-1) and l is the path length (cm). The instrument was standardised using camphor sulfonic acid (CSA) frequently to ensure of results. \u0003\u000f = \u000e . 32,982 \u00d7c\u00d7l Equation 1 and racemic -2,3-diaminobutane and 2 R,3R-diaminobutane (2 R,3R-bn) (Figure 2.1) were synthesised using an adaptation of the procedure reported by this project. Sodium hydroxide pellets (371.0 g, 9.0 mol) were di ssolved in water (3000 mL), with the reaction maintained at ~ 5 \u00b0C in an ice/sa lt bath. To this solution dimethylglyoxime (DMG) (116.0 g, 1 M) was added in small increments. The dissolution of DMG produced a clear yellow solution . Catalytic Raney aluminium- nickel (175.0 g, 2.0 mol) was added slowly to this solution. The reaction temperature maintained at or below 35 oC by immersion in an ice/salt bath. The resulting r eaction mixture was stirred in the ice bath until the tempe rature ceased increasing and was then left to stir overnight. The catalyst\u00a7 was removed by filtration. The filtrate containing the crude 2,3-diaminobutane was distille d at 100 \u00b0C (~ 2500 mL was obtained). 2,3-Diaminobutane dihydrochloride was is olated by acidifying the filtrate to pH 1.5 with HCl (8.8 M). The volume was reduced to dryness under reduced pressure to yield 2,3-diaminobutane dihydrochloride as a cream coloured hygroscopic solid The insoluble white crystalline meso -2,3-bn was isolated by vacuum filtration and was air dried (33 .3 g, 27%). The filtrate containing rac-2,3-bn was reduced under reduced pressure, the res ulting brown viscous solution was dissolved in ethanol and allowed to stand for 2 4 h. The white crystalline product (racemic ) was collected by vacuum filtration and was air dr ied (33.4 g, 27%). The meso -2,3-bn and rac-2,3-bn 6H, H3 \u0007/H4\u0007). \u00a7 Ensure the catalyst does not dry completely, as con tact with air can cause a vigorous exothermic reaction. Discard with water. 22 2.3.3 Isolation of rac-2,3-diaminobutane The rac-2,3-diaminobutane dihydrochloride (33.4 g, 207 mmo l) was dissolved in water (10 mL) and the pH was then adjusted to 14 us ing potassium hydroxide (10 M). The free diamine was extracted with DCM (10 \u00d7 50 mL), the DCM layers were combined, dried over anhydrous sodium carbonate and filtered. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure to yield a viscous y ellow liquid, rac-2,3-bn (3.3 g, 18%). 2.3.4 Resolution of rac-2,3-diaminobutane The method reported by Gullotti et al .66 was used in an attempt to resolve the isomers of rac-2,3- (19.2 g, 128 mmol) was dissolved in water (125 mL) and to this solution rac-2,3-bn (3.3 g, 37 mmol) was added drop-wise while stirring. Excess methanol (~ 250 mL) was added and the solution stor ed at 4 \u00b0C overnight. A white precipitate was collected by vacuum filtration, was hed with ethanol (10 mL), diethyl ether (10 mL) and air dried. The filtrate was reser ved for isolation of 2R,3R- diaminobutane. The product, H 2[2S,3S-diaminobutane][ R,R-tartrate] was recrystallised from a mixture of water and methanol (1:1). A white crystalline product was collected by vacuum filtration (6.6 g, 45.95%). 1H NMR (400 2[2R,3R-diaminobutane][ S,S-tartrate] filtrate collected from the isolation of H 2[2S,3S-diaminobutane][ R,R-tartrate] (above) was reduced to dryness under reduced pressu re. The white product obtained was dissolved in water (10 mL) and adjusted to an a lkaline pH of 14 by the addition of potassium hydroxide (10 M). The free diamine was extracted using DCM (10 \u00d7 23 50 mL), the DCM layers combined and dried over anhy drous sodium carbonate. The DCM was removed under reduced pressure producing a viscous yellow liquid. Which was added drop wise to a solution of S,S-(-)-tartaric acid (3.9 g, 0.03 mmol) in water (26 mL) while stirring. Excess methanol (78 m L) was added and the mixture was stored at 4 \u00b0C overnight. A white crystalline s ubstance was obtained and isolated by filtration. The crystals were washed with ethano l (10 mL), diethyl ether (10 mL) and air dried. The product was then recrystallised from a mixture of water and methanol (1:2), (0.7 g, 4.54%). 1H R,R-2,3-bn tartrate salts to hydrochloride salts was achieved by the addition of saturated potassium chl oride. Potassium chloride was added until potassium hydrogen tartrate formed. The mixture was then stored at 4 \u00b0C for 24 h. The solid potassium hydrogen tartrate was removed by filtration. The filtrate, containing the soluble hydrochloride salt of the isomers was evaporated. 2.3.8 Isolation of the free diamine from the tartr ate salt or dihydrochloride salt The desired diamine salt (2 R,3R- or 2 S,3S-bn.tart; meso - or rac-2,3-bn.2HCl) was dissolved in water (10 mL), this solution was adjus ted to pH 14 using potassium hydroxide (10 M). The diamine was extracted using D CM (10 \u00d7 50 mL) and the combined DCM extracts were dried over anhydrous sod ium carbonate and filtered retaining the filtrate. The solvent was removed und er reduced pressure to produce a viscous pale yellow liquid. 24 2.4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 2.4.1 Synthesis of mesomeric - and racemic - 2,3- diaminobutane.dihydrochloride The three ancillary ligands were synthesised by an adaptation of the method reported by Dickey et al .65 The simple hydrogenation reaction of DMG was perfo rmed by combining a solution of sodium hydroxide and cataly tic Raney aluminium-nickel to produce a crude mixture of meso - and rac-2,3-diaminobutane (Figure 2.2). This reaction was vigorous and required the temperature to be monitored closely. The temperature was not permitted to exceed 35 \u00b0C at an y stage, the temperature was controlled using an ice bath.

The reaction mixture containing the catalyst and 2, 3-diaminobutane was carefully filtered ensuring that the catalyst was always kept moist (as dry catalyst spontaneously combusts when exposed to the atmosphe re). The 2,3-diaminobutane was isolated from the filtrate by steam distillatio n (at 100 \u00b0C) as a clear, colourless solution. The major by-product is 3-amino-2-butanol which distills at temperatures below 100 \u00b0C and therefore any distillate collected below 100 \u00b0C was discarded. The crude meso - and rac-2,3-bn were isolated by the addition of hydrochlor ic acid to produce a HCl salt. After rotary evaporation of the acidified distillate, a hygroscopic cream coloured product was obtained and as a conseq uence, yields were not recorded. The crude mixture of products was used as isolated for the separation step. 25 2.4.1.1 Separation of rac- and meso- 2,3-diaminobutane.dihydrochloride The crude products isolated, meso - and rac-2,3-diaminobutane dihydrochloride were separated by methanol recrystallisations. This was made possible by taking advantage of the different solubility properties ex hibited by the two isomers. The meso- isomer was (mostly) insoluble, while the rac- isomer was (mostly) soluble in methanol (Figure 2.3). The meso -2,3-bn was isolated by filtration and the filtrate containing the rac-2,3-bn was isolated by evaporation. Both isomers w ere recrystallised several times from methanol. .H2N *HCl Figure 2.3 The schematic representation of the isolation of th e rac- and meso - isomers. It was difficult to isolate stereochemically pure meso - and rac-isomers. Even after several recrystallisations as small amounts of the rac-isomer was present in the meso- isomer and small amounts of the meso- was in the rac-2,3-bn. The 1H NMR spectra (Figure 2.5), clearly illustrates evidence of this with the resonances of each isomer exhibiting slightly different chemical shift s. Each spectra show the presence of both isomers and in each case small peaks occur close to the large peaks of the major isomer. The proton numbering is given below i n Figure 2.4.

Comparison of chemical shifts of the two spectra confirmed that a small amount of the rac- isomer was present in the meso- mixture and a small amount of the meso- isomer was present in the rac- isomer (Figure 2.5). Quantification of the small amount of meso - in the r ac-2,3-bn and rac- in the meso -2,3-bn was achieved by analysis of the integral of the peaks, which con firmed that the meso- isomer contained 23% of the rac-isomer, while the contained ~ 10% of the meso - isomer. Figure 2.5 The 1H NMR spectrum of (a) rac-2,3-bn.2HCl and (b) meso -2,3-bn.2HCl in D 2O. After determining that neither meso- or rac-2,3-bn could be isolated as a pure isomer, using the current method, the literature was examin ed further to reveal another study (a) (b) H1\u0007/H2\u0007 H1\u0007/H2\u0007 H3\u0007/H4\u0007 H3\u0007/H4\u0007 27 where the chemical meso- and rac- isomers with enantiomeric purities were quantified al.65 did not report 1H NMR characterisation for the compounds investigated. In fact, this method was developed before NMR characterisation was widely available. S till, the method developed by Dickey et al. is preferred by many including Fanizzi et al.68 and Milanesio et al.69 because it is an inexpensive reaction and large qua ntities of compound are obtained. The meso -isomer synthesised in this project was coordinated to platinum whereas the rac- isomer was resolved before coordination. 2.4.1.2 Isolation of rac- 2,3-diaminobutane The rac- isomer was required as a free amine for resolution into 2 S,3S- diaminobutane and 2 R,3R-diaminobutane. This was accomplished by adding KOH to a solution of rac-2,3-bn.2HCl to adjust the pH 14. The presence of a free amine was confirmed by performing a ninhydrin assay, where a change in colour from brown to blue indicated the presence of a free amine. The fr ee diamine was extracted using DCM. The resulting salt remained in the aqueous lay er, while the diamine was soluble in DCM and water. Multiple extractions with DCM, were used to isolate the 2,3-diaminobutane. The combined DCM layers were dri ed over anhydrous sodium carbonate. The DCM was removed under reduced pressu re, to yield the diamine as a viscous yellow liquid. Residual DCM was present in this product. The yields were fairly low due to the limited efficacy of extractio n. The presence of diamine in the aqueous layer was confirmed by a ninhydrin test, ev en after multiple extractions with DCM. 2.4.1.3 Resolution of rac- 2,3-diaminobutane The resolution of the free rac-2,3-bn.2HCl into 2 S,3S-bn and 2 R,3R-bn salts was achieved by using an adaptation of the method repor ted by Gullotti et 2S,3S-Diaminobutane isolated by the slow addition of the free rac-2,3-bn to the resolving agent, R,R-(+)-tartaric acid (from a water/methanol system) t o form crystals of H 2[2S,3S-diaminobutane][ R,R-tartrate]. The S,S-isomer crystallised first as its solubility in the polar solvent system is li mited. To encourage further crystallisation, the mixture was stored at 4 \u00b0C ove rnight. The fine crystals were collected by vacuum filtration and were washed with ethanol (10 mL) and diethyl ether (10 mL). The filtrate was retained and reduce d to dryness. The same procedure was used to isolate the free rac-2,3-bn.2HCl from the filtrate. The 2 R,3R- diaminobutane was isolated from the mixture by the slow addition of the viscous diamine solution to S,S-(-)-tartaric acid (in a 1:1 water-methanol system) , to form crystals of H 2[2R,3R-diaminobutane][ S,S-tartrate]. The crystals were collected in the same manner as previously described. A flow chart, to illustrate the process is provided in Figure 2.6. The R,R- and S,S- diasteromers revealed the expected number of resonances but the chemical shifts revealed that a small amount of the meso - isomer was still present in the resolved R,R- and S,S- isomers. The 1H NMR spectra exhibited three distinct resonances. The only proton resonance visible due to tartaric acid reson ated at 4.54 ppm (this was confirmed by comparison of tartaric acid spectrum). Protons from H1 \u0007/H2\u0007 resonated 3.72 ppm for S,S- and R,R- isomer respectively two protons. The protons from H3 \u0007/H4\u0007 resonated at 1.37 and 1.36 ppm for S,S- and R,R- isomer respectively, these peaks integrated for six protons. The proton assignment was confirmed through two dimensional NOESY experim ents, where cross peaks were observed between the resonances assigned to H1 \u0007/H2\u0007 and H3\u0007/H4\u0007. The two dimensional proton/carbon spectrum (HMQC) (Appendix A.3) was used to assign the chemical shifts to the carbons. The amine and h ydroxyl peaks were not observable in the spectra as the sample was measure d in D 2O and had exchanged. 29 50% (2) Filter Figure 2.6 The separation of 2 S,3S-bn and 2 R,3R-bn. The CD spectra of the diasteriomers, R,R-bn.tart and S,S-bn.tart (Figure 2.7) were measured to reveal that they are opposite and almos t equal. Techniques such as optical rotation and CD can only be used to quantif y enantiomeric purity when compared with an optically pure sample of the same compound. In this case CD could not be used to determine enantiomeric purity. Here the diasteriomers show the chiral signature of each compound. The peak at ~ 21 3 nm is due to the tartaric acid70 30 and the smaller of the two peaks centred at 195 nm is due to the 2,3-bn. The peaks appear at the same wavelength, but upon closer insp ection small variations in intensities can be observed and are confirmed by th e calculations of molar absorptivities (Table 2.1). The CD for the free ena ntiomers is not reported, as it was negligible for the enantiomers. -80-60-40-20020406080 190 200 210 220 230 240 250 260 270 280 290 300 Wavelength (nm)Molar Ellipticity (mdeg/M.cm) Figure 2.7 The CD spectra of R,R-bn.tart R,R- tartaric acid (----), S,S-bn.tart and S,S-tartaric acid ( ___ )(0.5 mM).

Compounds Peak 1 Wavelength (nm) and \u0002\u0003 (mdeg/M.cm) Peak isomers were not stereochemically pure, but wer e used to synthesise the platinum(II) complexes. Synthetic routes for the op tically pure 2,3-diaminobutane (greater than 95% enantiomeric purity) have been re ported by Chooi et al.71 and Scaros et al. ,72 however these technique have some drawbacks, inclu ding expensive reagents, poor yields and the formation of potentia lly hazardous intermediates. 31 Synthesis by these methods would only be considered if the platinum(II) complexes with these ligands are active against cancer cells. 2.4.1.5 Conversion of tartrate salts to hydrochlor ide salts Conversion to the hydrochloride salt was undertaken to stabilise the enantiomers. Upon addition of saturated potassium chloride to th e respective diasteriomers (in its tartaric acid forms) a fine precipitate formed. To encourage precipitation the mixture was stored at 4 \u00b0C for 24 h. This effectively preci pitated potassium hydrogen tartrate, leaving the soluble enantiomer as a hydrochloride s alts. The precipitate was removed from solution by filtration and the filtrate was re duced to dryness and the enantiomer collected as a hydrochloride salt (either 2 S,3S-bn.2HCl or 2 R,3R-bn.2HCl). 2.4.1.6 Isolation of the free diamine from the tar trate salt or dihydrochloride salt In order to coordinate to platinum, the free diamin es is required; therefore it is necessary to liberate the enantiomer from either ta rtrate or hydrochloride salts. The enantiomer was liberated by dissolution in an alkali ne solution (of NaHCO 3), followed by extraction in DCM. 2.5 CONCLUSIONS The three isomers of 2,3-diaminobutane and However, the rac- and meso - isomers were not able to be completely separated. The r ac- isomer was found to be ~ 90% enriched, while the meso- isomer was determined to be ~ 77% enriched. The is omeric purity of ligands was determined by measuring integrals in th e 1H NMR spectrum, which was revealed as a useful technique for quantifying enan tiomeric purity. CD spectroscopy and optical rotation provided limited information w hen quantifying purity of ligands without suitable standards for comparison. The conv ersion of the tartrate salts of the amines to hydrochloride salts proved to be effe ctive for stabilising the ligand. Although other techniques exist, Dickey's method is the most convenient, efficient and effective way to synthesise 2,3-diaminobutane in large quantities. This is why 32 this method is still used although it has been 50 y ears since it was published. The method used for resolution of the isomers however n eeds improvement. If the resulting complexes produce cytotoxic effects in ca ncer cell lines, then it will be worthwhile exploring other separation strategies or synthetic options to produce enantiomerically pure ligands. 33 CHAPTER 3 INORGANIC SYNTHESIS In this chapter the synthesis and characterisation of a series of platinum(II) complexes are presented. The platinum(II) complexes were synthesised and coordinated to different intercalating and ancillar y ligands to investigate the structure activity relationship of these ligands on the overa ll activity of the platinum(II) complexes against cancerous cells. 3.1 MATERIALS - Sodium hydroxide pellets were p urchased from MERCK. C-18 2 g Sep-pak\u00ae columns were purchased from Waters respectively. P otassium tetrachloroplatinate was purchased from precious me tals online. Deuterated solvents such as dimethyl sulphoxide ( d6-DMSO) and deuterium oxide (D 2O) were purchased from Cambridge isotopes. Solvents and analytical re agents such as acetonitrile (ACN) ethanol, acid (TFA) were purchased from J. T. Baker, Labserv, Mallinckrodt Chemicals, PRONALYS or AUSPEP. 3.2 EQUIPMENT AND SPECTROSCOPIC TOOLS 3.2.1 Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) Spectroscop y NMR spectra were acquired using either a 300 MHz Va rian mercury or a 400 MHz Bruker Avance spectrometer. Samples were prepared in D 2O or d6-DMSO and experiments were carried out at a temperature of 25 oC (for D 2O) and 35 oC (for d6- DMSO). One dimensional spectra were measured with a spectral width of 7,000 Hz, with 50,000 data points and a relaxation delay of 3 .7 s. Two dimensional nuclear Overhauser effect (NOESY), Correlation (COSY), and Heteronuclear Multiple 34 Quantum Coherence (HMQC) spectra were obtained usin g a 3500 Hz spectral width with 256 increments in the t1 dimension, 2048 points in the t2 dimension and a mixing time of 0.3 s. Chemical shifts are reported in parts per million (ppm) and J coupling constants are reported in Hz. Spin multipl icity is specified as: of doublets), t q bd (broad doublet). UV dou ble-beam spectrometer was used to obtain UV-Vis absorption spectra. Absorptio n maxima of metal complexes were measured in a 1 cm quartz cuvette between 200- 800 nm to determine the molar extinction coefficient ( \u000f, mol-1.dm3.cm-1). The molar extinction coefficient was calculated using the Beer-Lambert equation. Samples were prepared in water to a concentration of 25 M. 3.2.3 Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy A was used to characterise ligands and metal complexes. Samples were prepared in water to ~ 0.4 mM. Samples were placed in 1 cm quartz cuvette and spectra were obta ined in the range 190-400 nm at ~ 25 \u00b0C. Ten accumulations were acquired with a scan speed of 500 nm.min-1, a response of 1 s, a spectral bandwidth of 1 nm, a se nsitivity setting of 100 mdeg and a nitrogen flow rate of 7 L.min-1. Using the angle of ellipticity ( \u000e, mdeg) obtained the CD spectra the molar absorptivity ( \u0003\u000f, mdeg/ M cm) was determined using Equation 2, where c is the concentration (mol.L-1) and l is the path length (cm). The instrument was standardised using camphor sulfonic acid (CSA) frequently to ensure the reliability of results. 3.2.4 Synchrotron radiation circular dichroism (SR CD) spectroscopy Synchrotron radiation CD (SRCD) was obtained at the Institute for Storage Ring facilities (ISA), Aarhus University, Denmark. Sampl es were prepared in water at a concentration of 4.0 mM. A calibrated 1 nm Quartz c ell (124a7) was used. 35 Measurements were between 170-400 nm at ~25 \u00b0C . Accumulations (3-6) were of 9.5 L\u00b7min-1. 3.2.5 Linear dichroism (LD) (CD spectrometer) was used to characterise ligands and metal complexes. Samples were prepared in PVA films. Measurements were acquired b etween 190-400 nm at ~ 25 \u00b0C. One accumulation was acquired with a scan speed of 500 nm.min-1, a response of 1 s, a spectral bandwidth of 1 nm and a nitrogen fl ow 7 L.min-1. 3.2.6 Stretch LD of intercalating ligands PVA films were prepared according to a reported met hod.73 In brief, low molecular weight PVA was dissolved in water (10% w/v) in a mi crowave oven. The viscous clear solution was allowed to stand for 5 min and w as poured onto a microscope slide (~ 5 mL). A dry sample of the I L (5,6-Me 2phen, 4,7-Me 2phen, 3,4,7,8-Me 4phen or 4- Mephen) was added to the microscope slide. The I L was mixed through the PVA and the PVA was spread evenly onto the surface of the m icroscope slide. The slide was allowed to dry for 24 h. The film was removed from the slide and stretched using a hair dryer and a mechanical stretcher. 3.2.7 Electrospray ionisation mass spectroscopy (E SI-MS) from a Finnigan LCQ adva ntage Max (Thermo Electron Corporation) quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with an ESI source at CSIRO. Samples were prepared in a 1:1 mixture of H 2O:ACN or in methanol. The loop injection had a flow rate of 10 \u00b5L/min. The spectra were obtained in the range m/z = 200 - 1800 at different voltages. The pressure of t he nitrogen gas was 60 psi and the temperature of the capillary was ~ 170 \u00b0C. 3.2.8 Elemental analysis Elemental analysis for C, N and H was obtained from the Australian National University (Microanalytical Unit, Research School o f Chemistry) using a Carlo Erba 1106 automatic analyser. 36 3.3 SYNTHESIS OF PLATINUM(II) COMPLEXES 3.3.1 Synthetic route A for [Pt(I L)(A L)]Cl 2 The published method was used for the synthesis of 56MESS, 56MERR and 56MEEN.74 Potassium tetrachloroplatinate (K 2PtCl 4) and the ancillary ligand - A L (where A L = 1 S,2S-diaminocyclohexane, 1 R,2R-diaminocyclohexane or 1,2- diaminoethane) (1 mol. equiv.) was dissolved in wa ter (50 mL), stirred (1 h) at room temperature (rt) and left to stand overnight at 4 \u00b0 C. The yellow precipitate was collected by filtration (through a 0.45 \u00b5m membrane filter paper), rinsed with water, ethanol and diethyl ether (20 mL of each). The metal complex [Pt(A 2] was then refluxed with 5,6-Me 2phen (1.1 in water (~100 mL) for 24 h, prod ucing a yellow solution. The solvent was removed under redu ced pressure to ~ 20 mL. A Waters C-18 reverse phase Sep-Pak\u00ae was activated with methanol (10 mL) and washed twice with water (2 \u00d7 10 mL). The concentrated solution was loaded onto the activated column and eluted as a yellow solutio n with water (2 \u00d710 mL) leaving an orange/brown band on the column. The first eluan t was reduced to dryness under reduced pressure. The orange/brown band was eluted with 90% ACN - to produce an orange/brown solution; which was reduced to dryness and redissolved in a minimum of water. This was then re loaded onto the Sep-pak\u00ae column and collected as a yellow solution. The solv ent from this solution was removed using reduced pressure and the products fro m both solutions were combined. The solvent was then removed under reduce d pressure to yield a solid. Reactant quantities and yields are reported in Tabl e 3.1 below. 37 Table 3.1 Summary of the synthesis of [Pt(I L)(A L)]Cl 2 by synthetic route one.

The intercalating ligand - I in hot DMSO (40 mL) and the two solutions were then combin ed while stirring. The mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature and was then stored at 4 \u00b0C overnight. A fine yellow precipitate containing [Pt (IL)Cl 2] was collected by filtration. The product was washed with HCl (20 mL, 1 M), aceto ne (20 mL), water (20 mL), ethanol (20 mL), and diethyl ether (20 mL). The res ulting yellow product obtained was dried under vacuum at 110 \u00b0C. The general struc ture of the compounds synthesised here is given in Figure 3.1. Characteri sation data is not included for these intermediates, due to their insolubility in the deu terated solvents.

The yellow solution was filtered (through a 0.45 \u00b5m membrane f ilter paper) to remove insoluble impurities. Saturated sodium perchlorate ( ~ 2 mL) was added to the filtrate. The solution containing the precipitate was left to sta nd at 4 \u00b0C. The product was collected by filtration and was rinsed with water, ethanol and diethyl ether (20 mL of each). The precipitate was stirred in water (60 mL) with IRA-400 (Cl) Amberlite ion resin until the precipitate dissolved. The mixture was filtered to remove the resin. The solvent from the filtrate was removed under red uced pressure.

This mixture was stirred for approximately 1 h at rt and was then stored at 4 \u00b0C to encourage further precipitation. This produced [Pt(A L)Cl 2] (as a fine precipitate). The second step involved the coordination of ([Pt(A L)Cl 2] to the intercalating ligand (I 56MESS, 56MERR, 56MEEN) or 5-Mephen (for 5MESS) in water. The mixture was refluxed for approximately 2 4 h. With heating, the insoluble IL dissolves and coordinates to the [Pt(A L)Cl 2] to form [Pt(I L)(A L)]Cl 2. A schematic diagram given below depicts this two step reaction (Figure 3.2). 51 Pt ClCl Cl Cl2-H2N H2N2+ ** ** * * Figure 3.2 A schematic diagram representing the two step react ion developed by Aldrich- Wright and co-workers, (*) indicate a chiral centre in the dach ligand. In this example 5,6- Me 2phen and used. 3.4.1.1 Purification of [Pt(A L)(IL)]Cl 2 Unreacted I L or any reduced platinum that may have been present from the reflux was easily removed using a Waters C18-reverse phase Sep-pak\u00ae column. The column was activated and then the reaction mixture was add ed to the column. Firstly a yellow band was eluted with water; this band contai ned pure platinum complex (confirmed through 1H NMR characterisation). A second band (orange/brow n) that remained on the column was eluted by ACN (90%) /wat er (9%) /TFA (1%) this band was collected and reloaded on to a new column and e luted with water. A small black band remained on the column (containing reduced pla tinum). 1H NMR characterisation of the combined bands was used to confirm purity. Also yields were not affected by this technique (Table 3.4). The synthesis of the platinum(II) complexes contain ing the ancillary ligands (A L) = 1,2S-pn, 1,2 R-pn, 2 S,3S-bn, 2 R,3R-bn or 2 S,3R-bn could not be achieved by this method. The coordination of K 2PtCl 4 to pn or bn produced very low yields or the platinum reduced from Pt(II) to Pt(0). This reducti on could be a result of residual base present from the synthesis of A L. In the case of bn, a small quantity of product was isolated, but they were not soluble in deuterat ed solvents, this indicated that the expected platinum complex had not formed. The metho d of McFadyen et. al.33 was used for the synthesis of platinum species where A L was 1,2 S-pn, 1,2 R-pn, 2 Synthesis of platinum(II) complexes via synthetic route B 3.4.2.1 Synthesis of [Pt(I L)Cl 2] The method of McFadyen et. al.33 involves the coordination of the I L to platinum first. In general, the synthesis involved the disso lution of K 2PtCl 4 and I L DMSO followed by mixing the two solutions and allow ing it to cool. This technique causes precipitation of [Pt(I L)Cl 2] almost immediately. This is due to a highly reactive [Pt(DMSO) 2]Cl 2 intermediate that is formed, allowing easy coordin ation of the I L. The mixture containing the yellow precipitate was stored at 4 \u00b0C overnight to induce further precipitation. 3.4.2.2 Synthesis of [Pt(A L)(5,6-Me 2phen)]Cl 2 where [Pt(I L)Cl 2] was refluxed with excess 1,2R-pn, McFadyen et al ., but did not produce product even after 72 h of refluxing. It w as postulated that the amines of the AL were required to be neutralised. After the neutrali sation of the A L with NaHCO 3 (as a stronger base would immediately reduce the pl atinum), the A L was then refluxed with [Pt(I L)Cl 2]. The reaction eventually became a clear yellow so lution, indicating that coordination of the A L was successful. 3.4.2.3 Purification of [Pt(A L)(IL)]Cl 2 where Purification of [Pt(I L)(A L)]Cl 2 was necessary to effectively isolate the complex f rom impurities, by-products and any excess A L used in the synthesis. Isolation of the platinum compound from solution was achieved by pre cipitation with saturated sodium perchlorate. The product was collected and r insed with water, EtOH and diethyl ether to remove any residual impurities. Af ter this isolation, the precipitate was resuspended in water and IRA-400 (Cl) Amberlite ion resin was added to the suspension. The mixture was gently stirred for seve ral hours (or until all the precipitate dissolved). The resin was removed, and the filtrate containing [Pt(I L)(A L)]Cl 2 was reduced to dryness and characterised. This meth od was used 53 when coordinating to the A L: 1,2 S or 1,2 R-pn and 2 S,3S-, 2S,3R- or 2 R,3R-bn, a schematic of synthetic route B is represented in Fi gure 3.3.

Spectroscopic tools such as circular dic hroism can be used to determine the chirality of isomers, UV-Vis absorption can det ermine the hypochromic nature of a compound and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spe ctroscopy can give useful 55 information about the arrangement of atoms.75 NMR spectroscopy works by applying radio-frequency electromagnetic radiation to a coll ection of nuclei placed within a strong magnetic field to determine the organisation of atoms in a molecule. 76 The family of platinum(II) metallointercalators syn thesised in this study were characterised by two dimensional (1H NMR, 13C NMR and 195Pt) NMR. Some examples of the characterisation process are d etailed and discussed, all other results are presented in tables for comparison and the spectra are reported in the appendices (Appendix A, B and C). 3.5.1 Characterisation via 1H NMR chemic al shifts, spin-spin couplings, and intensities, all of which aid in the elucidation of the structure.77 The figure below shows the numbering system used for 1H and 13C NMR characterisation of the platinum(II) complexes. The 1H NMR spectra of 56MESS is reported below in Figure 3.5. 56MESS was chosen as the example, as it was the complex most u sed in this project. Within the spectra, nine distinct peaks are visible. Peaks fro m aromatic compounds typically resonate above seven ppm, therefore the downfield p eaks above 7 ppm are all due to the I L (5,6-Me 2phen), two doublets and a doublet of doublet were o bserved. The aliphatic peaks on the other hand, resonates furthe r upfield, typically below 5 ppm. The resonances due to the A L (S,S-dach) are in this region. Four broad doublets and a broad triplet in the aliphatic region were observed . 56 110 1112 56 Figure 3.4 The proton and carbon numbering utilised for the pl atinum(II) complexes of the type [Pt(A L)(IL)]Cl 2 are shown here, where the red represent the A L and the blue represents the I L. (*) Represents a chiral centre. 57 Symmetrical molecules such as 56MESS display only h alf the number of aromatic peaks, therefore, the 1H NMR for 56MESS shows only 8 resonances. Protons f rom positions H4/H7 were assigned to resonance at 8.90 ppm ( Hz) were assigned to H2/H9. This assignment was determined through splitting pattern s and coupling constants, as aromatic protons in close proximity of nitrogen ato ms typically display smaller coupling constants in comparison to a proton furthe r away. The doublet of doublet resonating at 8.02 ppm was assigned to H3/H8 by mea suring the coupling constants and observing the splitting patterns. 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 ppm8.0 8.2 8.4 8.6 8.8 ppm 1.5 2.0 2.5 ppm Figure 3.5 1H NMR spectrum of 56MESS at 30 mM in D 2O at 25 \u00baC. Expansions between 7.9-8.9 ppm spectra were used to further confir m the assignment given to the resonances on the 1D spectrum. Two dimensional spec tra can be an extremely useful tool in confirming the characterisation of a compou nd. Techniques such as the NOESY and COSY are often used to gather information in two dimensions. The NOESY spectra uses through space interactions of pr otons, while the COSY spectra uses the coupling interactions of protons.78 The COSY spectrum in Figure 3.6, give information that supports the one dimensional proto n assignment for 56MESS, since coupling interactions (cross peaks) are observed be tween the two doublets and the doublet of doublet. Also a NOE peak (Appendix A.4) is observed between the doublet assigned to H4/H7 and the peak at 2.61 ppm, which confirms that this peak belongs to the protons of H5/H6 (from the methyl gr oups).

H1 \u0007/H2\u0007 was assigned to the doublet at 2.78 ppm as it integrated to two protons (due to ne ighbouring amines which cause deshielding effect). In the 2D COSY spectrum a cros s peak is observed from H1 \u0007/H2\u0007 at 2.78 ppm to the doublet at 2.29 and 1.55 ppm, su ggesting that these peaks are due to H3\u0007/H4\u0007. Protons of H5 \u0007/H6\u0007 were assigned to the 1.73 ppm and the triplet at 1.31 ppm. This assignment was made by th e observation of cross peaks from 1.55 ppm to these two peaks (suggesting that t hese peaks are next to one another). 60 Table 3.5 Proton assignment for complexes of the type [Pt(I 8.85 H3 8.02 8.01 7.99 8.01 8.01 7.99 7.98 8.01 8.01 H4 8.90 9.05 8.74 9.05 8.99 8.95 8.80 9.05 9.03 H8 8.02 8.01 7.97 8.01 8.01 7.99 H9 8.84 8.86 8.85 8.88 2.80 2.96 3.01 3.01 3.45 3.09 3.07 H2\u0004 2.78 2.75 2.80 2.96 3.01 3.01 3.45 3.38 3.39 H3\u0004 1.55, 2.29 1.52, 2.25 1.58, 2.31 - 1.43 1.43 1.47 1 .48 1.49 H4\u0004 1.55, 2.29 1.52, 2.25 1.58, 2.31 - 1.43 1.43 1.47 - - H5\u0004 1.31, 1.73 1.28, 1.70 1.32, 1.73 - - - - - - H6\u0004 1.31, 1.73 1.28, 1.70 1.32, 1.73 - - - - - 61 Assignment Complex 5MESSBN 5MESRBN 47MESRBN 8.04 7.85 7.81 7.84 H4 8.98 8.98 3.40 2.87 2.90 2.83 H5 2.86 8.77 8.77 3.40 2.87 2.90 8.66 H8 7.96 7.96 7.85 7.81 7.84 8.01 H9 1.40 1.45 1.48 1.45 H4\u0004 1.42 1.42 1.40 - 2.90 1.45 H5\u0004 - - - - - - H6\u0004 - - - - - - 62 Assignment 2.59 2.80 8.29 2.77 2.75 8.87 8.91 8.94 8.95 8.89, 8.84 7.97 8.21 8.19 8.16 8.04 H6 7.97 7.69 8.21 7.93 8.21 8.19 8.16 8.04 8.87 8.91 8.94 8.95 8.89, 8.84 2.59 2.80 8.29 3.43 3.39 3.04 3.42 3.01 3.40 3.42 1.49 1.47 1.46 1.42 1.42 1.49 1.51 H4\u0004 1.42 - - 1.46 1.42 1.42 - - H5\u0004 - - - - - - - H6\u0004 - - - - - - - - - 63 3.5.2 Chiral discrimination through 1H NMR The platinum complexes that contain the isomers of 2,3-bn, display different proton chemical shifts for the enantiomerically enriched c omplexes (as was discussed in Chapter 2). Only the variation in the chemical shif ts of the -CH groups are visible in the platinum compound. 3.5.3 Characterisation via 13C NMR A typical spectrum gives a proton broad-band decoupling and data build up to give chemical shift data for d etermining the resonances of carbon atoms and thus the structure of a molecule.79 Two dimensional carbon spectra such as HMQC use 13C vs. 1H is a highly sensitive method due to the abundance of 1H; and as a consequence the time taken to obtain a spectrum is reduced. This type of technique presents information about a proton and t he carbon it is directly coupled to.80 The spectrum is plotted on perpendicular axis (one representing the proton and the other carbon). This means a proton attached to a carbon atom displays a cross peak. A HMQC spectrum of 56MESRBN was obtained (Fig ure 3.7) which shows carbons coupled to protons, carbons that are not co upled to any protons (as in the case of quaternary carbons) are not depicted. The s pectra below shows a cross peak from H2/H9, suggesting that these protons are coupl ed to a carbon. Cross peaks from H4/H7 and H3/H8 to carbon peaks were also observed. These types of two dimensional characterisation techniques are used to aid the characterisation of carbon resonances (Table 3.6). 64 Figure 3.7 A HMQC spectrum of 56MESRBN in D 2O Table 3.6 Carbon-13 and platinum-195 assignment for complexes of the type [Pt(I L)(A L)]Cl 2 where the I L is 5,6-Me 2phen or phen and the 13C NMR do not prove that platinum is bound to the li gands. To establish this 195Pt NMR spectra for the platinum(II) complexes were obtained (chemical shifts are given in Table 3.6). The product and reactants' chemical shifts were com pared. The chemical shift of the products and the starting material (K 2PtCl 4) varied significantly; this confirmed that unreacted starti ng material was not present and that the ligands were bound to platinum. All platinum re sonances were below the chemical shift of K 2PtCl 4, indicating that the ligands may have coordinated to the platinum.81 The difference in chemical shift is due to deshiel ding effects experience by K 2PtCl 4 from the chlorine ligands which shifts the resonanc es downfield. Further confirmation was made through two dimension al 1H-195Pt NMR spectroscopy, which shows through space interaction s between platinum and protons. The example below illustrates cross peaks between t he I L and the platinum, indicative of coordination and proving that the che mical shift is not due to any other platinum species. Platinum NMR spectroscopy is a sensitive technique, this was particularly apparent for the platinum(II) complexes containing 2,3-bn li gands which were not enantiomerically pure. The 195Pt NMR, showed two neighbouring peaks. One peak was significantly larger than the other. This confi rms that in addition to 1H NMR, 195Pt NMR in some cases can reveal different chemical shifts for these chiral compounds. 3.5.5 UV-visible spectroscopy The determi ned through UV-Vis spectroscopy is often used in combination with CD.75 Information in regards to the electronic nature of a molecule especially unsatura ted compounds can be obtained by this characterisation tool. Organic molecules gener ally absorb light in the ultraviolet region of an electromagnetic spectrum, in addition light in the visible region is also absorbed for some organic complexes. These types of absorption produce a spectrum 69 as a result of the incident radiation and possibly electronic transition in the sample studied being of same energies.82 The UV-Vis spectra of the platinum complexes were m easured to determine absorption maxima. The molar extinction coefficient s were calculated from absorption maxima using the Beer-Lambert equation. Two large peaks were observed for all platinum species. These peaks aris e mostly due to the intercalating ligands. The spectra obtained for platinum complexe s containing 5,6-Me 2phen is presented in Figure 3.8. A list of the wavelengths and molar extinction coefficients for all the platinum complexes is presented in Tabl e 3.7. Spectra can be found in Appendix E. 70 Table 3.7 The UV-Vis and SRCD data for the series of metal 72 -0.100.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.9 200 220 240 260 280 300 320 340 360 380 400 Wa ve l en g t h ( n m)56M ESS ionisation mass spectroscopy A simple analytical characterisation tool that can be used on platinum species of this nature is electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). Often molecules that are used for in vitro or in vivo studies (as the platinum drugs in this project) ar e not volatile or fairly stable under high temperatures s o volatisation before ionisation cannot occur. Electrospraying is not defined as an ionisation technique, in fact it is better known as the transfer of ionised analyte in the liquid phase, then into the gas phase as fragmented molecules.83 ESI-MS can be a simple technique to quickly prove that the correct compound is synthesised. The data obtained from ESI-MS is analysed by calculating the [M]2+ and [M]+ for the platinum complex and by comparing the calculated results to the obtained va lues confirmation of synthesis can be obtained. The results are given in Table 3.8. Th e results are in agreement with the calculated values in all cases. Spectra are given i n Appendix D. 73 Table 3.8 The ESI-MS fragments of the platinum(II) complexes. 3.5.7 Synchrotron radiation circular dichroism (SR CD) Conventional CD provides information about the left and right-handed photons of chiral molecules when electric field vectors trace these spiralling electrons in circularly polarized light; this interaction is tra nslated into a CD spectrum. This type of characterisation is often used to represent the opposite chirality of molecules.84 Synchrotron radiation CD differs from conventional CD only in the high light flux Compound Calculated [M]2+ and the synchrotron source which allows data to be obtaining at lower wavelengths.85 CDtools was used to plot SRCD data.86 Because several platinum(II) complexes contained chiral ancillary ligands in thi s study, it is important to determine the chirality of the platinum complexes s ynthesised from the ligands. The chiral signature of each chiral platinum complex wa s determined through CD and SRCD. The CD and SRCD spectra obtained for the enan tiomers (56MESS and 56MERR) are shown in Figure 3.9 and Figure 3.10 res pectively. SRCD allows for characterisation to ~170 nm (due to high light flux as mention above), this is 20 nm more than conventional CD. The SRCD data for chiral ly opposite molecules is presented in Table 3.7. Figure 3.9 The CD spectrum of 56MESS and 56MERR between 190-40 0 nm, 0.4mM, 1 cm. 270 320 370 wavelength (nm)CD (mdeg) 56MESS 56MERR Figure 3.10 The between 170- 400 nm, 4mM, 0.1 cm. 290 340 390 Wavelength (nm)CD [MDEG] 56MESS 56MERR 75 The spectra were equal and opposite which confirmed that these were indeed enantiomers. The peaks below 270 nm are thought to be due to ligand centred transitions, while the peaks above 270 nm are thoug ht to be due to metal to ligand charge transfer. This was confirmed by examining ju st the intercalating ligand (5,6- Me 2phen) via stretch LD. Stretch LD allows for the examination of achiral molecules like the intercalating ligands used in this project to align with the PVC when stretched. The number of peaks exhibited by the lig and was determined via this technique. The two spectra essentially reveal the s ame information, except that the SRCD of 56MESS and 56MERR has one extra peak betwee n 170-190 nm. Also the time required to obtain SRCD spectra is drastically reduced in comparison to conventional CD. The SRCD spectra for the other chi ral molecules synthesised in this study, as well as the stretch LD spectra for t he ligands is given in Appendix F. 3.6 CONCLUSIONS The platinum(II) complexes were successfully synthe sised via two synthetic routes. In general high yields were obtained, however, synt hetic route B is more time consuming. The complexes were characterised by one and two dimensional 1H, 13C, and The combination of characterisation t ools used confirmed the composition of the platinum(II) complexes synthesis ed. 76 CHAPTER 4 DRUG FORMULATION CSIRO has developed a patented family of cationic l iposomes, which have been used to deliver genetic material into cells.55,63,87 K3C6TL3 is one of the lead tris lipid molecules from a family of cationic lipids (Figure 4.1). Cationic liposomes have only recently been explored for the transport of small t herapeutic drugs58 and here cationic liposomes are used to the encapsulate selected plat inum(II) complexes for transport. The process used to formulate drugs into K3C6TL3 li posomes, along with characterisation techniques used to quantify the en capsulated drug and evaluate the nature of incorporation (i.e. - whether the drug is in the aqueous cavity, bilayer membrane or surface of the liposomes) is presented in this chapter. Figure 4.1 The structure of the individual lipid, K3C6TL3 is s hown with the circle highlighting the hydrophilic head group, and the bo x highlighting the hydrophobic tail group. Individual lipids aggregate to form a liposo me (right). 4.1 MATERIALS and acridine orange were 77 High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC ) HPLC analysis was conducted on a Waters HPLC instru ment (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, U.S.A) equipped with a 600 solvent del ivery system, 600 automated gradient controller, a Phenomenex Gemini C18 column (5 micron, 150 \u00d7 4.6 Altech 2000 Evaporative Light Scattering Dete ctor (ELSD). The mobile phases consisted of two buffers, buffer A (H 2O/ACN (50/50) + 0.05% TFA) and buffer B (THF/ACN (50/50) + 0.05% TFA). A linear gradient fr om 100% buffer A - 100% buffer B over 8 min, continued with 2 min at 100% o f buffer B and 4 min at 20% buffer B was used. The solvent flow rate was mainta ined at 1.00 mL/min. 4.2.2 Dynamic light scattering particle size distribution of liposomes was det ermined dynamic light scattering (DLS). (Nano mW, 633 nm) and an avalanche photodiode detector wa s used to measure particle size distribution as a function of intensity and di ameter in nanometres (d: nm). Samples were prepared in ultra pure water and measu rements were made in disposable low volume cuvettes (ZEN0117). DLS analy sis was performed at 25 \u00b0C. were obtained for each measurem ent. 4.2.3 Electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (E SI-MS) Mass were obtained at CSIRO using a Finniga n LCQ advantage Max (Thermo Electron Corporation) ion trap quadrupole m ass spectrometer equipped with an ESI source. Samples were prepared in a 1:1 mixtu re of H 2O:ACN or in methanol. The loop injection had a flow rate of 10 \u00b5L/min. Th e spectra were obtained in the range of 200 - 2000 m/z at different voltages. The pressure of the nitroge n gas was 60 psi and the temperature of the capillary was ~ 1 70 \u00b0C. 78 4.2.4 Synchrotron small angle X-ray scattering (SS AXS) SSAXS measurements were obtained at the Australian Synchrotron Radiation Source (Melbourne, Australia). Samples were prepared in H 2O (5 mM), in capillary tubes, which were sealed by heating at both ends. The samp les were placed in a capillary sample holder engineered specifically for the Austr alian Synchrotron. The temperature of the sample holder was maintained by using a circulating water bath and the temperature of the capillary tube was monit ored during measurements by the insertion of a thermocouple between the metal cell holder and in close proximity to the samples. The diffraction patterns were correcte d by subtracting the transmission and background and were placed on an absolute scale using water as the secondary standard. The sample-detector distance was calibrat ed using a standard silver behenate sample which typically depicts regularly s paced peaks in the range q = 1.5- 20.0 \u00c5. Scattering intensities were plotted as a fu scattering vector q. 4.2.5 Cryogenic-Transmission Electron Microscopy ( cryo-TEM) Particle size and type was determined through cryo- TEM analysis. Samples (4-5 L) were prepared on a 300 mesh copper TEM grid (coated with a carbon film - ProSciTech, Thuringowa, Queensland, Australia) and were allowed to settle for 30 s. The TEM grid was blotted for ~ 15 s, yielding a thi n film, which was cryo-preserved by submerging in liquid ethane. The TEM grid was th en stored in liquid nitrogen prior to transferring to a Gatan 626-DH cryo-holder . Images were obtained through an FEI Tecnai 12 TEM, equipped with a MegaView III CCD camera. The temperature of the sample was maintained at -180 \u00b0C . 4.2.6 Centrifugation Samples were centrifuged in a SIGMA laboratory cent rifuge 3K18C series, Quantum scientific PTY LTD. The rotary speed was set at 500 0 rpm, 4 \u00b0C, for 40 minutes. 79 4.2.7 Vortexing Liposomes were prepared by vortexing lipids hydrate concentrated drug solutions. An IKA\u00ae vortex mixer Ms2 was used to prepare liposomes and dissolve other solutions. 4.2.8 Linear dichroism The LD component on a Jasco r was used to characterise liposomes and liposomal-drugs. Samples were prepare d in ultra pure water. When solutions of molecules like liposomes are subjected to shear forces and passed across a stationary surface at 1 m/s the molecules can ali gn (i.e - sufficient orientation has occurred to ensure that A// and A are different). Quartz cells allow spectra to be obtained in the visible and UV regions. A Couette f low cell circulates the sample between rotating and stationary cylinders (Figure 4 .2). Sample rotation speed was controlled by adjusting the voltage, using a variab le power supply (Maplin, Bench PSU). The resulting spectra were obtained in the range 19 0-700 nm at ~ 25 \u00b0C. Three accumulations were acquired with a scan speed of 50 0 nm.min-1, a response of 1 s, a spectral bandwidth of 1 nm, a sensitivity setting o f 100 mdeg and a nitrogen flow rate of 7 L.min-1. Figure 4.2 The Couette flow cell used to hold the sample for m easuring the LD. were carried out at 25 \u00b0C in D2O. The spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance 400 spectrometer, opera ting at a 1H resonance frequency of 400.13 MHz. A spectral width of 5,000 Hz was used, with 64 scans, 80 an acquisition time of 1.0 s, a 90\u00b0 pulse width of 15.2 s and a delay of 1.3 s. A line broadening of 0.5 Hz was applied prior to Four ier Transformation. Spectra were internally referenced to the HDO peak at 4.76 ppm. Diffusion measurements were performed using a modified Hahn spin-echo-base d PGSE pulse sequence, optimised to reduce signal loss due to spin-spin re laxation.88,89 The delay between the gradient pulses ( \u0012 - the time scale of the diffusion experiment), was 150 ms. The gradient pulse width, \u0001, was set to ~ 5 ms. Echo attenuation of the metal complex resonance (aromatic) was measured at 20 different gradient amplitudes ( g, between 0-0.53 T.m-1) in each diffusion measurement. The attenuation ( E) of the spin-echo signal for the diffusing molecul e is given by:90 )3(2 2 2 =Dc g eE Equation 2 Where \u0002 is the gyromagnetic ratio of the nucleus, g is the strength of the magnetic field gradient, \u0001 is the length of the gradient pulse, Dc is the diffusion coefficient and \u0003 is the delay time between two incorporated pulsed field gradients.91 The diffusion coefficient ( Dc) was determined by fitting the integral data obtai ned from PGSE experiments to Equation 2, using Microsoft Excel a linear regression of this data was used to then calculate the Dc.92 4.3 METHODS 4.3.1 Formulation of a thin lipid film K3C6TL3 was synthesised and supplied by Dr Minoo Mo ghaddam and co-workers from CSIRO, following established literature method s.93 In brief, K3C6TL3 (15 mg) was dissolved in ethanol (~ 1 mL) and the solvent w as removed under reduced pressure (not exceeding 40 \u00b0C as the lipid can degr ade at very high temperatures). HPLC (retention time (min)): 8.59. Dynamic of K3C6TL3-drug liposomes To the prepared thin lipid film, a platinum drug (1 0 mM, 1 mL) solution was added slowly to the lipid film while vortexing the mixtur e. Final concentration of liposome was ~ 11.58 mM and drug concentration was 10 mM wit hin the 1 mL sample. The sample for the fluorescent model was made by hydrat ing the fluorescent lipid film with the addition of acridine orange (10 mM/ 1 mL), while vortexing. The K3C6TL3-drug formulation was isolated from the reac tion mixture using to a Centricon\u00ae (with a membrane filter with a molecular weight cut off 2000 kD). The 1 mL K3C6TL3-drug preparation was centrifuged twice a t 5000 rpm for 40 min at 4 \u00b0C. The retentate and filtrate were analysed by HPL C using ELSD and PDA detectors. The area under the curve of a sample bef ore centrifugation and after centrifugation was compared to calculate the percen tage of drug encapsulated in the liposome (Figure 4.4). Dynamic light scattering of K3C6TL3-56MESS revealed that the liposomal nanoparticles were polydisperse as th e population size was too diverse. Synchrotron small angle X-ray scattering was used t o compare the morphology of the cationic liposomes. 4.3.3 Linear dichroism 4.3.3.1 Determination of optimum conditions for L D measurements A solution of ct-DNA was prepared (0.25 mM) and the LD spectrum was obtained at different Couette flow speeds controlled by changin g the voltage. Ethidium bromide (0.05mM) was added to the ct-DNA solution (0.25 mM) in water (1 mL). 4.3.3.2 SoyPC liposome preparation L-\u0011-phosphatidylcholine in chloroform; the chloroform was gently evaporated under nitrogen and was placed in a desiccator for ~ 2 hours. The soyPC was redissolved in water (1.29 mL, 10 mg/mL) and freeze- thawed (five times) in liquid nitrogen. 4.3.3.3 Formulation of drugs with SoyPC liposomes SoyPC (~ 10.0 mg) was dissolved in chloroform; the solvent was gently evaporated under nitrogen and then stored in a desiccator for ~ 2 hours. Anthracene (anthracene 82 was dissolved with the liposome in chloroform), sul forhodamine B or 56MESS was dissolved in water with the liposomes. The samples were prepared as a 50:1 molar ratio of lipid to drug. The soyPC was redissolved i n water (1 mL) and freeze-thawed (five times) in liquid nitrogen. 4.3.3.4 Formulation of 56MESS with K3C6TL3 liposo mes K3C6TL3 (5 mg) was dissolved in ethanol and the sol vent was removed under reduced pressure. 56MESS (500 \u00b5L) was added to the lipid film and the mixture was freeze-thawed (five times) in liquid nitrogen to pr oduce a 50:1 molar ratio of lipid to drug. The LD spectrum of the K3C6TL3-56MESS liposom es was measured. Rhodamine B was added (50:1 molar ratio of lipid to rhodamine B) to the K3C6TL3- 56MESS liposomes solution and the LD measured. Fina lly this solution 5 \u0007- adenosine triphosphate (ATP) (50 \u00b5M) was added and the LD spectrum measured. 4.4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 4.4.1 Synthesis and characterisation of K3C6TL3 an d K3C6TL3-drugs Liposomes were prepared by a well established liter ature method.93 This procedure is an effective and easy way to prepare liposomes and liposomal-drug formulations. Lipids were dissolved using ethanol, reduced to dry ness and then hydrated with water. Encapsulation of drugs within the liposomes was achieved using a drug solution to hydrate the lipids and induce liposome formation to encapsulate the drug within. The first attempt to remove any unencapsulated drug molecules from the liposomes involved placing the formulated sample (liposomes, platinum drug and water) in dialysis membrane tubing with a molecular weight cu t off lower than the molecular weight of the lipid. The dialysis tube was then pla ced in water (1 L) for 6 hours. The sample within the dialysis tube was analysed by HPL C in 50% EtOH/H 2O, in order to lyse the liposomes and release the drug within. The results revealed that no platinum complex was present in the dialysed sample . It was possible that the platinum complex had leaked from the liposomes; as this has been reported for some 83 other hydrophilic drugs.94 An alternative method to remove the unencapsulated platinum complex was devised. Using a Centricon\u00ae (Figure 4.3) the liposomal- complex formulation (1 mL) was placed in the reserv oir, which is separated from the filtrate by a membrane filter with a molecular weig ht cut off of 2000 kD. The Centricon\u00ae is then centrifuged to remove most of the solvent (~ 0.8 mL, collected as filtrate). Any unencapsulated molecules should pass through the membrane of the Centricon\u00ae, while large aggregates of liposomes and liposomal drugs are retained in the sample reservoir. Figure 4.3 An illustration of a Centricon\u00ae, the reservoir contains particles too large to pas s the membrane. The mixture from the reservoir was analysed by HPLC prior to and after centrifugation. The samples were again analysed in 50% EtOH/water. Two large peaks of the K3C6TL3-drug formulation were identifi ed through HPLC using the ELSD detector (Figure 4.4). The retention times wer e comparable with the retention times of the drug and the liposome and were assigne d to the respective molecules (Table 4.1). The area under each peak was measured to determine the quantity of drug within the K3C6TL3-drug formulation (pre- and post centrifugation). The amount of drug encapsulated was calculated as a per centage of the area under the peak of the initial sample used prior to centrifuga tion. A literature review revealed that hydrating a lipid film with a hydrophilic drug leads to limited encapsulation of the drug.95 Other more time consuming techniques exist,96 and need to be investigated further to determine th e suitability of the technique for this type of system (hydrophilic platinum complex w ithin a cationic liposome). Filtrate Reservoir > 2000 kD < 2000 kD 84 Table 4.1 A summary of the drug formulation and HPLC-ELSD dat a. The percentage of drug encapsulated in the liposome and the retention time of the drug and the liposome is given below. Liposomal Drug Drug RT (min) and (area (mVsec)) Liposome RT (min) and of a Centricon\u00ae was successful in removing unencapsulated drug, as confirmed through HPLC analysis. The drug encapsula tion quantities obtained in this study however exceeded some others reported in lite rature.93 Further improvements could be made to the formulation, since only ~ 30% of the drug was encapsulated in most cases. 85 mV 0.00200.00400.00600.00800.001000.001200.001400.001600.001800.002000.002200.00 Minutes1.00 HPLC of (A) a K3C6TL3-drug formulation pri or to centrifugation, (B) retentate in the Centricon\u00ae after centrifugation and (C) the filtrate in the C entricon\u00ae after centrifugation. HPLC analysis of these samples was carried out in 50% EtOH (to liberate the drug from the liposomes). The peak at ~ RT = 1.5 mi n (due to the platinum complex) was used to quantify the amount of drug present. The pe aks after RT = 7 min are due to the K3C6TL3 liposomes (and were not quantified by HPLC) . and K3C6TL3-drug particles were determined by DLS. The liposomes were hydrated with water and were not extruded because cationic liposomes aggregate much more readily. Def initive conclusions could not be drawn from the DLS data, since measurements of K3C6 TL3 liposomes indicated that A B C 86 the liposomal particles were bimodal with most of t he population of nanoparticles ~ 37 nm (Figure 4.5) and a small population between 1 00-1000 nm. The dispersion of liposomal particles can produce bimodal nanoparticl es; a uniform population size can be obtained by extrusion. In contrast, the DLS meas urement for K3C6TL3-56MESS revealed that the sample was polydisperse. This cou ld be the result of larger aggregates forming with platinum(II) complexes with in the liposomes. 05101520 0.1 1 10 100 1000 10000Volume (%) Figure 4.5 The DLS measurement obtained for a K3C6TL3 sample, where the y-axis is I (intensity) and the x-axis is the diameter in nm. The Cryo-TEM images of the liposomes supported the DLS data, which indicated that the size was less than 50 nm (Figure 4.6) and the particles were unilamellar in nature. The small particle size has been reported t o be advantageous for in vivo studies.96 Figure 4.6 Cryo-TEM images of cationic unilamellar liposomes. An aggregate of liposomes are shown within the red box. 200 nm I size in d:nm 87 SSAXS is a well established technique for the chara cterisation of nanostructured materials, such as the cationic liposomes used in t his study. This technique can determine the diffraction pattern for dilute sample s of dispersed nanoparticles. The SSAXS data indicated that the morphology of the lip osomes and the liposomal drugs are the same (Figure 4.7). This suggests that the d rugs are not within the liposome membrane, since typically the morphology of the uni lamellar liposomes change. This conclusion was drawn by comparisons of the SSAXS da ta obtained for the K3C6TL3 liposomes and K3C6TL3-56MESS and K3C6TL3-5MESS. Fig ure 4.7 illustrates that there is very little difference between the K3C6TL3 liposomes, K3C6TL3-56MESS or K3C6TL3-5MESS. The small observable differences are thought to be due to small variations in concentrations. Typically if a drug is embedded in the membrane of the K3C6TL3 liposomes, a distinct change in the minimum of the peaks would be observed (indicative of a drug embedding with the m embrane). This was not observed, indicating that the drug is not embedded in the membrane of the liposomes. Figure 4.7 The SSAXS data obtained PGSE NMR were carried out to determine the diffusion coefficient ( Dc) of the lipsomes. The Dc is dependent on the size of a diffusing molecule. This is directly related to the Stokes-Einstein equation: Equation 3 Where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, \u0003 is solvent viscosity and r is the effective hydrodynamic radius. A linear regression of the integral data obtained from the PGSE experiments on equation 2 was used to dete rmine the Dc. It is clear from equation 2 that as g increases, so does the spin-echo intensity. Severa l attenuations are typically obtained with increasing gradient val ues ( g) to accumulate several spectra with increased peak intensities. The same r esonance is integrated for each spectrum to calculate the Dc. All experimental parameters were kept constant ex cept for g. A plot of E against -\u00012g2\u00022Dc(\u0003-\u0002/3) is shown below in Figure 4.8. The absolute value of the slope of this plot represents the Dc. plot of spin-echo intensity against - \u00012g2\u00022Dc(\u0003-\u0002/3) for the determination of the D c for the K3C6TL3 liposomes and K3C6TL3-56MESS (6 mM ) in D 2O at 25 \u00b0C. rkTD6= 89 The data obtained above indicates that the drug is in fact encapsulated within the liposomes. Since the K3C6TL3 liposome particles dif fuse at a slow rate D 2O (2.24 \u00d7 10-10 m2s-1), while the liposome with drug encapsulated diffus ed slightly faster. Comparison of the diffusion of K3C6TL3-56ME SS (3.26 \u00d7 10-10 m2s-1) with the on 10-10 m2s-1)97 alone. Alth ough the Dc for K3C6TL3- 56MESS is not the same as that for K3C6TL3 liposome s, it was proposed that the Dc of K3C6TL3-56MESS is effectively an average of the Dc of the 56MESS and K3C6TL3-56MESS in the solution. This indicates that some of the drug may have leaked out of the liposomes. 4.4.4 Linear dichroism 4.4.4.1 Determination of optimum conditions for LD measurements The orientation and location of the platinum(II) co mplexes within the liposomes was (LD). Experimen ts determined optimal Couette flow speed which is controlled by a variable voltag e unit. The alignment of large molecules such as DNA or liposomes requires a Couet te flow speed that limits turbulence (which can create inaccurate spectra). T his speed was determined by obtaining the LD of ct-DNA at varying voltages (0.7 , 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5 and 3 V); these spectra are compiled in Figure 4.9. The LD absorban ce peak at 260 nm was measured and plotted against its respective voltage (Figure 4.10). 90 -0.025-0.02-0.015-0.01-0.00500.005 200 250 300 350 Wavelength (nm)LD (a.u)DNA 0.7 V DNA 1V DNA 1.5 V DNA 2 V DNA 2.5 V DNA 3 V Figure 4.9 The LD spectra of ct-DNA (0.25 mM) at increasing Co uette flow voltages. -0.04-0.03-0.02-0.010 0 1 2 3 4 Voltage (V)LD (a.u) Figure 4.10 The optimal Couette flow voltage is determined from this plot of LD absorbance units against its respective voltage at 260 nm, whe re the linear region represents the range of Couette voltages that does not induce turbulence. From this plot it was determined that the optimal v oltage was 1.5 V; this is because after 1.5 V the LD intensity plateaus. When the int ensity begins to plateau, typically this indicates that the sample is turbulent. All sp ectra were obtained at a voltage of 1.5 V and were corrected for the no spin and blank (water). An additional experiment was conducted to confirm t he optimal performance of the LD spectrometer. This was achieved by measuring the spectrum of a sample of ct- DNA and the spectrum after ethidium bromide is adde d (Figure 4.11). The ethidium 91 bromide enhanced the LD spectrum of DNA, this was o bserved as an increase in the LD absorbance of the peak corresponding to DNA (Fig ure 4.12). This occurs due to orientation of ethidium bromide when it intercalate s into DNA. Figure 4.11 Schematic of a Couette flow cell with DNA before an d after the addition of ethidium. The ethidium orientates perpendicular to the axis of the DNA. This results in an increase in DNA absorbance. -0.03-0.02-0.0100.01 200 300 400 500 600 Wavelength (nm)LD (a.u) DNA 0.25 mM DNA + EtBr Figure 4.12 The LD spectra of ct-DNA at 0.25 mM and ct-DNA wit h ethidium bromide at 0.25 mM and 0.05 mM respectively . 4.4.4.2 Formulation of drugs with SoyPC liposomes Initially no linear dichroism was produced by K3C6T L3-56MESS, this was thought to be due to the small particle sizes (< 50 nm), as typically smaller sized molecules are more difficult to align. A standard soyPC lipos omal sample was prepared by dissolving soyPC in chloroform and evaporating the solvent (to make a lipid film). The formation of liposomes was induced by using a f reeze-thaw technique (in liquid nitrogen). The soyPC liposomes were formulated with anthracene, sulforhodamine B Rotation axis H2NNH2 N+ Add ethidium Rotation axis 92 or 56MESS. The orientation of the formulated drugs was assessed with respect to the soyPC liposome, which will elongate and align with Couette flow as illustrated in Figure 4.13. The LD spectra of the three soyPC lipo somal drugs are shown in Figure 4.14, Figure 4.15 and Figure 4.16. Some of soyPC fo rmulations presented distorted LD signals, this was postulated to be due to light scattering, as large liposomes can limit the light that reaches the detector, thus pro ducing spectra that appear to have greater signals than expected.98 The visible LD spectrum (LD total) is usually a result of the absorbance of an oriented molecule (LDA) and any background turbidity dichroism (LD\u0013) obtained, this is presented in the equation below : LD total = LDA + LD\u0013 Equation 4 Figure 4.13 A schematic representation of the effect of shear f low on a liposome. The linear regression of the above equation to a fu nction can be used to correlate the LD\u0013 to the wavelength (Equation ), where a in the equation is a constant and k (the value associated to the unpolarised turbidity) is a value between 2.8 and 3.5. LD\u0013 ( ) = a -k Equation 5 The use of this technique for the correction of lig ht scattering is presented in Figure 4.14. This technique was used for most LD spectra o f soyPC formulations as greater light scattering was presented by these large macro molecules.

The spectrum is corrected for light scattering. Where t he pink represents the spectrum not corrected for light scattering, the green represent s the function used to correct for light scattering and the blue represents the corrected sp ectrum. The LD spectrum of the soyPC liposome formulation o f anthracene displayed a negative signal (Figure 4.15). Literature sources h ave reported that when anthracene is perpendicular to the short-axis of a molecule li ke DNA (or liposomes in this case), the spectrum is negative.99 From this result it was concluded that anthracene was embedded within the liposomal membrane (Figure 4.15 ). Since the transition moment of anthracene was known, the elucidation of the orientation of this molecule in soyPC was straight forward. The transition momen t of sulforhodamine B was determined and was used to represent a spectrum of a molecule that orients flat onto a liposome (i.e - the long axis of the molecule is parallel to the surface of the liposome).100 The sulforhodamine B interacts with the surface of the liposome (demonstrated by the positive LD - Figure 4.16). Th e 56MESS formulation of the soyPC liposome is also thought to be interacting wi th the surface of the liposome, as a positive LD signal was obtained (like the soyPC f ormulation of sulforhodamine B). 94 -0.002-0.0015-0.001-0.000500.0005 215 270 325 380 435 Wavelength (nm)LD (a.u) Figure 4.15 The LD spectrum of soyPC formulated with anthracen e (13 mM: 0.26 mM).

The LD spectr um of this sample was Long axis short axis O SSN+NEtEt EtEt O OOHO O-O 95 measured, but still no LD signal was observed. Even with the addition of rhodamine B into the formulation with the K3C6TL3 liposomes n o spectrum was observed. After investigating the possible causes for the lac k of alignment, it was postulated that the positive charge on the K3C6TL3 liposomes m ay have interfered with the interaction of rhodamine B with its membrane. To the mixture of K3C6TL3-56MESS and rhodamine B, A TP was added since it is anionic. The LD spectrum of this mixture showed two peaks (Figure 4.17), one corresponding to the ATP and one corresponding to t he rhodamine B. This indicated that the K3C6TL3 liposomes were aligned with the AT P neutralising the charge aided the interaction of rhodamine B with the K3C6T L3. This result confirmed that the liposomes are aligned. Although an LD spectrum was not obtained for K3C6TL3-56MESS, the sample displayed a UV spectrum of 56MESS. This confirmed that 56MESS was present in the K3C6TL3 li posomes. 56MESS did not interact with the membrane or the surface of the li posome as results obtained were not similar to any of the soyPC drug formulations. This data together with the evidence obtained through SSAXS suggests that 56MES S is inside the aqueous cavity of the K3C6TL3 liposomes. 00.0010.0020.0030.004 225 325 425 525 625 Wavelength (nm)LD (a.u) Figure 4.17 The LD spectrum of K3C6TL3-56MESS formulated with r hodamine B (13 mM: 0.26 mM) and ATP (50 \u00b5M). ATP Rhodamine B 96 4.5 CONCLUSIONS K3C6TL3-56MESS was successfully formulated, and une ncapsulated drugs were effectively removed through the use of a Centricon\u00ae. HPLC was successfully used to determine the quantity of drug encapsulated in the liposome. Approximately 30% of drug was encapsulated within the liposomes via this technique. The sizes of the liposomes were determined through DLS and cryo-TEM analysis to be < 50 nm. SSAXS data indicated that the platinum(II) complexe s did not change the liposome revealed that their diffusion coefficients a re different but the diffusion of 56MESS alone was faster than K3C6TL3-56MESS. The di ffusion of K3C6TL3- 56MESS was slightly faster than the diffusion of K3 C6TL3 on its own; it suggested that some 56MESS may have leaked out of K3C6TL3 lip osomes so that the diffusion of K3C6TL3-56MESS is an average of free and encapsu lated 56MESS. LD experiments established that 56MESS was not aligned in or on the liposome. The orientation of the K3C6TL3 liposomes was confirmed by interactions between the ATP/rhodamine B and the liposomes. The UV of the K3 C6TL3-56MESS confirmed the presence of 56MESS in the formulation of K3C6TL 3-56MESS. Together this data indicated that the 56MESS was contained within the aqueous cavity of liposomes. Future work should include exploring oth er techniques for drug formulation with liposomes, since it was postulated from the PGSE experiments that the drug may be leaking out of the liposomes. Other liposomes, for the formulation of platinum(II) complexes should also be explored. 97 CHAPTER 5 BIOLOGICAL TESTING New anticancer drugs are constantly being synthesis ed in the hope of finding an effective drug with limited adverse side-effects. A family of platinum intercalators have been developed by a group at UWS, with imethyl-1,10- phenanthroline)(1 S,2S-diaminocyclohexane) platinum(II)]2+ (56MESS) cytotoxic to date. The activity of 56MESS has been found to be equal to or greater than cisplatin in many cell lines and the c ommercialisation of this patented technology has already drawn the interest of pharma ceutical companies. 56MESS has some limitations though, the greatest of which is its lack of specificity. Liposomes have been used for the encapsulation and transportation of many therapeutic agents and the results are promising. E ncapsulation of drugs within liposomes has the following advantages 1) protectio n from degradation 2) extended circulation time in vivo and 3) the ability to use passive or active-target ing towards specific tissue. Among the many liposomes investiga ted for the transport of genes and vaccines, cationic liposomes have been the most extensively studied.87 These new drug delivery technologies are used here to enh ance anticancer activity of 56MESS and to limit adverse side-effects. In this chapter the biological activities of the pl atinum(II) complexes are presented, as well as the biological activity of the prepared liposomal-drug systems. Lastly, a fluorescent model in 4T1 mouse breast tumour cells is presented. This model depicts the uptake of the tris cationic liposomes formulate d with two fluorescent tags; one to represent the drug (acridine orange, AO) and the ot her to track the liposome (LissamineTM Rhodamine B) is presented. 98 5.1 MATERIALS AND REAGENTS The following chemicals were purchased were purchased from Cole-Parmer and AND SPECTROSCOPIC TOOLS 5.2.1 Incubator An IR Sensor CO 2 incubator (Sanyo, Japan) was used to incubate T752 flasks and nunclon 96-well plates containing cell cultures in media at 37 \u00baC and 5% CO 2. 5.2.2 Microscope A Zeiss Axiovert 25 inverted phase contrast microsc ope was used to observe the confluency of seeded cells in T752 flasks or 96-well plates. Tissue culture images were captured through an Olympus 1X81 microscope eq uipped with an Olympus camera. Fluorescent images were captured on a NIKON Eclipse 90i inverted microscope equipped with a NIKON camera with fluore scence and phase was used. 5.2.3 Plate reader Cell viability was measured using a Spectramax 340P C Molecular devices plate reader. 5.2.4 Coulter counter Cell density was measured using a Z2 Coulter counte r (Beckman Coulter Inc., USA). Samples were prepared by adding 100 \u00b5L of media con taining cells to 10 mL of sterile, distilled water. Measurements were reporte d as particles/mL. 99 5.2.5 In vitro testing The in vitro growth inhibition assays conducted at the Institute of Pharmac y, Greifswald University, Germany. In vitro cell growth inhibition assays were performed using a crystal violet microtiter assay.101 The platinum(II) complexes were tested on the huma n bladder carcinoma cell line (5637), the human non small cel l lung carcinoma (A427), the human uterine carcinoma (SISO) and the human promye locytic leukemia cell line (HL-60). Drug exposure time was 96 h for these cell lines at five concentrations (2- fold serial dilution). Cisplatin was used as a posi tive control for anticancer activity in this cell line. IC 50 values were the average of n = 3. The in vitro growth inhibition assays against L1210 (murine were also conducted at the Andrew Durant Drug Testing Facility of the Peter MacCallum Cancer Institute in Melbourne. The L1210 cell line was exposed to the drugs for a period of 48 h. The cyto toxicity was assessed using a standard cytotoxicity assay using Coulter counting to determine cell viability.102 The maximum concentration of drug used for testing was 40 \u00b5M. Cisplatin was used as a positive control for anticancer activity in this ce ll line. IC 50 values were the average of n = 2. Some preliminary in vitro experiments of K3C6TL3 li posomes, K3C6TL3-drug and platinum drugs against a variety of cell lines were undertaken at CSIRO (North Ryde). The cell lines: human estrogen dependant mam mary (MCF7), human lung fibroblast (MRC5), human prostate (PC3), mouse breast (4T1) and human estrogen independent mammary (MDA MB 231) cell line s were tested on the published method.103 100 5.3 METHODS Cytotoxicity assays of K3C6TL3 liposomes and K3C6T L3-drugs were lines: MCF-7, MRC-5, PC-3, m with 1% penicillin-streptococcus and 10% FBS). Standard ase ptic techniques were used to avoid contamination. 5.3.1 Cell revival, maintenance and passage Cryo-frozen stocks were briefly thawed and combined with RPMI 1640 media (~ 10 mL) in a T752 flask. The flask was incubated for 24 h, and then f resh medium (~ 13 mL) was added. The media was changed every 48 h. Ce lls were passaged when confluent (covered 80% of the flask - this was eval uated by observing under a microscope (Axiovert 25, Zeiss microscope 10\u00d7). Cell lines were split 1:3 once confluent. This was achieved by removing the media, rinsing the flask with PBS and adding trypsin (~ 3 mL) to the flask. The flask was tightly sealed and placed in the incubator for no m ore than 5 min. The flask was then gently (but firmly) tapped on the side to dislodge the cells. The cells were then passaged in RPMI 1640 media into a new flask. RPMI 1640 media \u00d7 104 cells/mL). The plates were incubated for 48 h or u ntil cells were confluent. The media was changed prior to the addit ion of drug solutions. The samples were prepared in RPMI 1640 media, PBS or ul tra pure water. The sample to be tested was added to the wells (10 \u00b5L) and each p late contained 4 - 6 replicates of the drugs tested. Decreasing concentrations (50, 10 , 2, 0.4 and 0.08 \u00b5M) across the plate were tested for each sample as well as a blan k which contained media only. Replicate plates were incubated for 24, 48 and 72 h . The viability of the treated cells was measured by using a standard MTS assay. MTS (10 \u00b5L) was added to all wells and the plate was incubated for 2 h prior to readin g the plate at 490 nm. Cell viability was measured using a Spectramax 340PC molecular dev ices plate reader. 101 5.3.3 Fluorescent microscopy K3C6TL3 (15 mg) was dissolved in ethanol (~ 1 mL) a nd 1% of LissamineTM Rhodamine B was added and the solvent was removed u nder reduced pressure. A sample was also prepared without LissamineTM Rhodamine B by the same method. To the two prepared thin lipid film a portion of ac ridine orange solution was added slowly to the lipid film while vortexing the mixtur e. Final concentration of liposome was ~ 11.58 mM and drug concentration was 10 mM wit hin the 1 mL sample. The fluorescent liposome formulation was then isolated using a Centricon\u00ae as described in Chapter 4. 4T1 cells (in 100 \u00b5L of RPMI 1640 media) were seede d (10 \u00d7 104 cells/ml) on microscope cover slips. The cover slips were placed in sterile 6 well plates and incubated for 24 h at 37 \u00baC and 5% CO 2. The media was removed from the cover slips and the cover slips were rinsed with PBS. Fre sh media was added to the cover slip (100 \u00b5L). Metal complex (10 \u00b5L of 10 \u00b5M of K3C or 50 \u00b5M of K3C 6TL3) was added to the cover slips and incubated for 6 h. After 6 h the me dia was removed and the wells containing the cover slips were rinsed with PBS (\u00d7 3). The PBS was removed and the coverslips were allowed to dry briefly before fixin g the cells by the addition of 4% para -formaldehyde, this was allowed to stand for 30 min . The para -formaldehyde was removed and the cover slips were dried briefly. Clear gel mount media (~ 100 \u00b5L) was placed on a clean sterile microscope slide. The cover slips containing treated and control 4T1 cells were mounted onto microscope slides by applying lacquer to the edges of the cover slips and by placing it on t he clear gel mount media. The cover slips were then allowed to dry. The treated cells o n the microscope slides were observed under a fluorescence microscope. FITC and TRITC filters were used. 102 5.4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 5.4.1 Toxicity studies with platinum(II) complexes The toxicity of the platinum(II) complexes against several cancerous cell lines was determined. The IC 50 values of all the metal complexes synthesised and tested in this project are presented below in Table 5.1. The IC 50 values obtained for the 5367, SISO and A427 human cancer cell lines are summarise d in Figure 5.1. The toxicity results against 5367 reveal that the most cytotoxic compound was 56MESRBN, followed by 5MESSBN > 56MERRBN > 56MESSBN > 5MESRBN PHENRRBN > and the least Th platinum(II) complexes containing methylated phenanthroline are non-methylated ph enanthroline intercalating ligands across the three human cell lines. Similar platinum(II) complexes have been explored in the past, with the same structure activ ity relationship, i.e. the methylated phenanthroline ligands were more active.34 Another trend observed throughout the three cell li nes is that 5MESSBN is more cytotoxic than 5MESRBN. PHENRRBN was found to be mo st active in the three cell lines in comparison to PHENSSBN and PHENSRBN ( except in A427, where it was ~ equivalent to PHENSSBN). 56MESRBN appears to be the most cytotoxic across the three human cell lines tested. This was an unexpected result for the platinum(II) complex coordinated to 5,6-Me 2phen and S,R-bn. Previously, when exploring the effect of ancillary ligand chirality on cytotoxicity, it was observed that the order of cytotoxicity of the phen bound platinu m(II) complexes ligands was R,R- > S,R- > S,S-.104 These results reported here suggest that there is no clear trend due to ancillary ligand chirality. The activity of the platinum(II) complexes in the three human cancer cell lines indi cates that certain platinum(II) complexes are more active in one cell line over the other two. This may be the result of a difference in the way a particular cancer cell uptakes drugs. 103 Table 5.1 The IC 50 values obtained for platinum(II) complexes against L1210, 5637, SISO and A427 cell lines. a The cytotoxicity assays conducted with L1210 at the Peter Macallum Cancer Institute, b,c,d and e are the cytotoxicity assays conducted with 5637, A4 27 SISO and HL-60 at the Institute of Pharmacy, Greifswald Univ ersity, Germany. IC 50 values are given as the mean \u00b5M \u00b1 standard deviation. The most active in each cell line is highlighted in bold. - - - - 56MERPN - - \u00b1 0.22 > 60 - - - 47MESPN 0.77 - - - - - - - 4MESRBN 2.8 \u00b1 0.07 - - - - 3478MESRBN > 50 - - - - 3478MESPN 1.13 \u00b1 0.66 - - - - 3478MERPN 2.2 \u00b1 0.99 \u00b1 1.91 - - - - PHENRPN 2.1 \u00b1 0.28 - - - - Cisplatin \u00b1 0.10 50 values (mean \u00b5M \u00b1 standard deviation) obtained for some platinum(II) complexes against 5637, A427 and SISO. The general structure of the platinum(II) complexes is also given, * represents a chiral cent re. Another important factor to note is the activity of these platinum(II) complexes in comparison to cisplatin. In the 5637 re more cytotoxic than cisplatin (0.35 \u00b1 0.10). This trend was also observ ed in the SISO cell line (in addition to 56MESSBN (0.18 \u00b1 0.05), which was also found to be more cytotoxic than cisplatin (0.24 \u00b1 0.06). A427 was not very responsi ve to cisplatin in comparison; this conclusion was drawn since all the platinum(II) com plexes were more cytotoxic than cisplatin (1.95 \u00b1 0.54), except PHENSRBN. The platinum(II) complexes were also tested on HL-6 0. They displayed limited cytotoxicity against this cell line, with IC 50 values greater than 60 \u00b5M for all the platinum(II) complexes tested (Table 5.1). Pt 50 values (mean \u00b5M \u00b1 standard deviation) obtained for some platinum(II) complexes (containing ancillary l igands) against L1210 (murine leukaemia). The L1210 cells were treated for 48 h w ith the platinum drugs dissolved in DMSO. The general chemical structure is also presen ted, where * represents a chiral centre, IL is the intercalating ligand. The cytotoxicities displayed by some of the platinu m(II) complexes against the L1210 cell lines were below 3 \u00b5M (Figure 5.2). The platinum(II) complexes containing phenanthroline ligands methylated at pos itions 5 and 6 were the most active, except for 56MESRBN (1.2 \u00b1 0.00), followed by platinum(II) complexes methylated \u00b1 0.36 and \u00b1 0.48 respectively) with the least active met hylated at position 4 (4MESRBN, 2.80 \u00b1 0.07). 47MESRBN and 3478MESRBN were inactive , with IC 50 values > 50 \u00b5M. This cell line presented cytotoxicities that di d not show the same trend as previous studies, i.e. R,R-bn was most active followed by S,S- and then S,R-. Most of the platinum(II) complexes were found to be less cy totoxic than cisplatin (at 0.5 \u00b1 0.00), except 56MERRBN (0.48 cytotoxic trend with respect to the intercalating ligand was in the order 5,6-Me 2phen > 5-Mephen > 4-Mephen > 3,4,7,8-Me 4phen. This observation is supported by previous res ults.30 Pt NH2 N N H2N **IL 106 The platinum(II) complexes containing the ancillary ligand diaminopropane were also tested against the L1210 cell line. Most of th e platinum(II) complexes were less cytotoxic than cisplatin at 0.5 \u00b1 0.00 (except for 56MERPN). The results are presented in Figure 5.3. The order of activity was 56MERPN > 56MESPN > 47MESPN > 47MERPN > 3478MESPN > PHENRPN > 3478MERPN > PHENSPN. From these results it appears that the cytotoxicity is highest when the I L is 5,6- Me 2phen, followed by 4,7-Me 2phen, 3,4,7,8-Me 4phen 50 values (mean \u00b5M \u00b1 standard deviation) obtained for the platinum(II) complexes ancillary ligands) against L1210 (murine leukaemia). The L1210 cells were treated with the p latinum drugs dissolved in H 2O for 48 h. The general chemical structure is also presented, w here * represents a chiral centre, I L is the intercalating ligand. 5.4.2 Preliminary cytotoxicity studies with K3C6TL 3 liposomes and K3C6TL3-drugs Some preliminary in vitro cytotoxicity studies were carried out for K3C6TL3 liposomes, K3C6TL3-56MESS, K3C6TL3-56MERR and 56MES S. One non- cancerous cell line and several human cancer cell l ines were cultured for the assays. Pt NH2 N N H2N *IL 107 The toxicity of drugs tested was measured by an MTS assay. MTS is metabolised by viable cells and the metabolite that is produced ab sorbs visible light which is plotted as a function of concentration at 490 nm. Cell viability was measured by absorbance and then calculated as a percentage of T/C, where T is the absorbance of treated wells and C the untreated. The liposomal drug formulations (synthesis described in Chapter 4 ) were tested against several cell lines and the results are presented below in Figure 5.4, Figure 5.5 and Table 5.2. Cytotoxicity results of K3C6TL3 liposomes, K3C6TL3-5 6MESS and 56MESS against 4T1 cells are presented in Figure 5.4. At a ll the concentrations of K3C6TL3 liposomes tested, no toxicity was observed. The cyt otoxicity for the K3C6TL3 liposomes was observed to be ~ 80% or greater for t he concentrations tested, this typically suggests that the tested compound is inac tive. The IC 50 value for 56MESS is greater than 20 \u00b5M where as the IC 50 value for K3C6TL3-56MESS is less than 1 \u00b5M. The absorbance (which is used to calculate cell viability) can sometimes be greater than the control; this was the case with 56 MESS at lower concentrations (this is observed as a percentage viability greater than 100). These experiments indicate that when platinum drugs are encapsulated within Tr is cationic liposomes their cytotoxicity is enhanced. In addition, there seems to be little difference in the activity of K3C6TL3-56MESS and K3C6TL3-56MERR (data not show n). The effect of drug exposure time on IC 50 was also explored with K3C6TL3-56MESS and K3C6TL3- 56MERR (presented in Figure 5.5). As expected IC 50 values decreased with drug exposure time. 108 020406080100120 0.01 0.1 1 10 100 Drug concentration (\u00b5M)Percentage viability (%) Figure 5.4 The percentage of viable 4T1 mouse mammary tumour c ells after range of concentrations.

T hese preliminary results for K3C6TL3-56MESS and K3C6TL3-56MERR will need to be r epeated with and without liposomes but they indicate that improved cyt otoxic results can be achieved with encapsulation by liposomes. Previous results f or PHENSS (0.52 \u00b5M) and 5MESS (0.07 \u00b5M) against PC3, report lower IC 50 values (i.e- higher toxicities).105 Table 5.2 The IC 50 values obtained for two liposomal drugs (\u00b5M) for th ree different cell 0.29 > 200 MDA MB 231 27 30 > 200 The liposomes without platinum(II) complex were tested against MRC-5, 4T1, MDA MB 231 and PC3 cell lines. The IC 50 values in the three cell lines were greater than the highest concentration tested (200 \u00b5M). These pr eliminary experiments suggest that K3C6TL3 liposomes will make an ideal transport m olecule for the delivery of anticancer drugs. These K3C6TL3 liposomes will also be particularly useful for the targeting of anticancer drugs, such as cisplatin, w hich is often easily degraded by thiol containing biomolecules. Previous in vitro testing at CSIRO revealed that a liposome (from the same family of liposomes) was not very toxic in vitro while the same liposome in vivo (in a mouse model) revealed that it possessed antitu mour activity (unpublished data). 5.4.3 Fluorescent microscopy K3C6TL3 liposomes were formulated with a commercial lip id tagged with Rhodamine B (LissamineTM Rhodamine B) in ethanol; the solvent was removed under reduced pressure to obtain a fluorescent thin lipid film. This lipid film was then hydrated with acridine orange. The K3C6TL3 lip osomes without LissamineTM Rhodamine B were also hydrated with acridine orange. The fluorescent liposomes were isolated using a Centricon\u00ae as described in Chapter 4. HPLC analysis of the sample revealed that ~ 30% of the drug was encapsul ated in each case. 110 To determine the cellular localisation of K3C6TL3 l iposomes and an encapsulated molecule (acridine orange), fluorescent tags were u sed in a cytotoxicity assay (Figure 5.6). The cellular localisation in 4T1 cells of K3C 6TL3 liposomes encapsulating acridine orange was determined by using LissamineTM Rhodamine B as a fluorescent tag. The images captured are presented below in Fig ure 5.7. The results indicate that the liposome is mostly localised within the membrane of the cell and in the cytosol, but does not cross the nuclear membrane. The acridin e orange localised within the cytosol and the nucleus as expected as it is a DNA/ RNA binder. This result show that the liposome does not cross the nuclear membrane but the encapsulated drugs can (as shown in Figure 5.7). The images are representative of the whole-field. Acridine OrangeLissamineTM Rhodamine BK3C6TL3= Figure 5.6 A molecular representation of the fluorescent lipos omes used. The results however support the lack of cytotoxicit y observed for the K3C6TL3 liposomes without drug (mentioned above). LissamineTM Rhodamine B and acridine orange were chosen to provide a fluorescent liposom e and an intercalator as they do not interfere with the fluorescence of each other. The disadvantage of using these two fluorescent tags was that their photo stability was limited, particularly that of acridine orange. This made capturing images difficul t as photo bleaching occurred rapidly. In addition, the drug of choice should pos sess greater photo stability. A 111 control containing only K3C6TL3 liposomes with Lissa mineTM Rhodamine B needs to be used as well. Figure 5.7 The fluorescent images captured of treated 4T1 mous e breast tumour cells a-e.

It appears that the platinum(II) compl exes coordinated to 5,6-Me than cispl atin. Platinum(II) complexes containing phen were identified as the least toxic (generally). All the platinum(II) complexes were more cytotoxic than cisplatin in A427 (except for PHENSRBN). The only trend observed in the L1210 cell line was due to intercalating Me 4phen). The platinum(II) complexes displayed an array of activity across the cell lines, suggesting that some platinum(II) complexes are more suited for particular cancer cells. The cytotoxicity of the platinum(II) c omplexes containing diaminopropane ancillary ligands on the L1210 cell l ine revealed no specific trend due to diaminopropane chirality. In this assay, the 5,6-Me 2phen intercalating found to be cytotoxic, followed by methylat ion at position 4,7-, 3,4,7,8- and the least active was phen. Preliminary cytotoxicity results for K3C6TL3 liposom es and K3C6TL3-drugs revealed that the K3C6TL3 liposomes are not cytotoxi c to the cell lines tested in this study, while K3C6TL3-56MESS and K3C6TL3-56MERR appe ar to possess some cytotoxicity. This suggests that K3C6TL3 liposomes may be suitable for use as drug delivery molecules. Further experiments need to be ca rried out however, to confirm that the K3C6TL3 liposomes do not possess any cytot oxicity and to determine whether the IC 50 values obtained for some of the K3C6TL3-drugs are r eproducible. The fluorescent microscopy images revealed that the l iposome is most likely localised in the membrane of the cells and the cytopl asm, but does not cross the nuclear membrane. This indicates that the greater tox icities exhibited by liposomal drugs are due the delivery of platinum(II) complexes into the cell and not directly into the nucleus. Future work should include in vivo testing and further fluorescent experiments to determine the definite localisation of the liposomes and the platinum(II) complexes within cells. 113 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK This project involved the evaluation of Tris cation ic liposomes (K3C6TL3) for the transportation of selected platinum(II) complexes. Th e main objective was to enhance the activity of existing and new platinum(II ) complexes against cancerous cells by encapsulating in cationic Platin um(II) complexes 2 S,3R-diaminobutane) were synthesised, characterised and the 2,3-diaminobutane was successfully synthesised by Dickey's method. However, complete isolation of th e rac- and meso - isomers was not possible. The isomeric composition of each ligan d was determined by 1H NMR spectroscopy (through integral measurements). The r ac- isomer was ~ 90% enriched (while still containing 10% of the meso- isomer) and the meso- isomer was enriched by ~ 77%. The opposite the isomers of 2,3 -diaminobutane cation of the isomeric composition of each ligand was not possible, since s tereochemically pure 2,3- diaminobutane standards were not available for compar ison. Dickey's method provided a convenient, efficient and effective way to synthesise 2,3-diaminobutane in bulk, even though complete isolation of the isome rs was not possible. The 2,3- diaminobutane ligands were coordinated to the platin um(II) complexes and their cytotoxic activity was determined. The platinum(II) complexes containing these ligands were fairly cytotoxic in some cancerous cell lines; as such the ligands need to be resolved further. Other techniques to produce en antiomerically pure ligands exist, although they are more time consuming. Future work sh ould explore these techniques to isolate the isomers of the ligands comp letely. The family of platinum(II) complexes were successfully synthesised by two different methods and were characterised by one and two dimens ional combination of characterisation tools used confi rmed the composition of the platinum(II) complexes synthesised. Selected platinum(II) complexes were successfully K3C6TL3 liposomes, any unencapsulated platinum(II) co mplexes was removed using a Centricon\u00ae. Quantification of platinum drug in liposomes was a chieved through HPLC analysis. In most cases, ~30% of the p latinum drug was encapsulated. K3C6TL3-56MESS was most extensively used in characte risation due to time constraints. K3C6TL3 liposomes were identified to be < 50 nm in size through DLS and cryo-TEM. SSAXS was used to assess if the lipos omes changed structurally when encapsulating a platinum(II) complex. It reveale d that the structure is not changed significantly. 1H PGSE NMR experiments were used to determine if platinum drug was contained within K3C6TL3 liposomes. This was determined by assessing the diffusion of K3C6TL3 liposomes and K3 C6TL3-56MESS, which revealed that their diffusion coefficients are slig htly different, but the diffusion of 56MESS alone was faster than K3C6TL3-56MESS. This c onfirmed that 56MESS is encapsulated within the liposomes. The diffusion of K3C6TL3-56MESS however, was slightly faster than the diffusion of K3C6TL3 l iposomes on its own; this suggested that some 56MESS may have leaked out of K3 C6TL3 liposomes so that the diffusion of K3C6TL3-56MESS is an average of fr ee and encapsulated 56MESS. The location of 56MESS within K3C6TL3 liposomes was determined through LD experiments, which revealed that 56MESS was not alig ned in or on the liposome (i.e- no LD spectrum was obtained). The UV of the same K3C 6TL3-56MESS sample confirmed the presence of 56MESS in the formulation of K3C6TL3-56MESS. LD experiments with K3C6TL3 liposomes and ATP/rhodamine B revealed that the K3C6TL3 liposomes were aligned and interacting with ATP and rhodamine B. The combination of this data indicated that the 56MESS w as contained within the aqueous cavity of liposomes. Future work should incl ude exploring other techniques for drug formulation with liposomes, since it was po stulated from the PGSE experiments that the drug may be leaking out of the l iposomes. Other liposomes, for the formulation of platinum(II) complexes should also be explored. 115 The platinum(II) complexes synthesised in this study were tested against several cancer cell lines. The platinum(II) complexes contain ing the diaminobutane ancillary ligands were tested against four human cancer cell l ines, the results revealed that in all cases 56MESRBN is most toxic. The cytotoxic tren d was that platinum(II) complexes coordinated to 5,6-Me or 5-Mephen were generally more cytotoxic than cisplatin. Phen based platinum(II) complexes wer e recognized as the least toxic (generally). The platinum(II) complexes were more cyt otoxic than cisplatin in the A427 cell line (except for PHENSRBN). The only stru cture activity relationship observed in the L1210 cell line due to intercal and 3,4,7,8-Me 4phen). There appears to be no overall trend in the platinum(II) c omplexes across the cell lines tested, suggesting that some platinum(II) complexes a re more suited for particular cancer cells (i.e- the uptake of different platinum complexes are different in each cell line). The cytotoxicity of the platinum(II) complexe s containing diaminopropane ancillary ligands were only assessed in the L1210 c ell line, this assay revealed no specific trend due to diaminopropane chirality. The platinum(II) complexes containing 5,6-Me to be most cytot however, followed by methylation at position 4,7-, 3 ,4,7,8- and the least active was phen. Some of the selected platinum(II) complexes that were formulated with the K3C6TL3 liposomes were tested against some cancerou s cell lines. The preliminary cytotoxicity results for K3C6TL3 liposomes and K3C6T L3-drugs revealed that the K3C6TL3 liposomes are not cytotoxic to the cell line s tested in this study, while K3C6TL3-56MESS and K3C6TL3-56MERR appear to possess some cytotoxicity. This may support the use of K3C6TL3 liposomes as dru g delivery molecules. These experiments are preliminary however and need to be r epeated. Future work should include confirmation of the lack of cytotoxicity of K3C6TL3 liposomes and to determine whether the IC 50 values obtained for some of the K3C6TL3-drugs are reproducible. The cytotoxicity assay performed with fluorescent liposomes revealed that the liposomes most likely become localised in t he membrane of the cells and the cytoplasm, but do not cross the nuclear membrane. This may support the theory that encapsulation of drugs in K3C6TL3 liposomes enhance the activity of platinum(II) 116 complexes as it is transported directly into the cel ls. Future work should explore extensive in vitro testing and followed by in vivo testing and further fluorescent experiments to determine the exact location of the l iposomes and the platinum(II) complexes within cells. 117 APPENDICES 1H R,R-bn.tart in D2O at 25 \u00baC. 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 5.0 ppm Appendix A.2 The 1H R,R-bn.tart in D 2O at 25 \u00baC. 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 D 2O at 25 \u00baC. ppm 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 ppm125 130 135 140 145 150 155 160 165 170 175 180 185 190 195 200 Appendix A.4 The 2D NOESY spectrum of 2O at 25 \u00baC. 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 5.0 5.5 6.0 6.5 7.0 7.5 8.0 8.5 9.0 ppm8.0 8.2 8.4 8.6 8.8 9.0 1H in D 2O at 25 \u00baC. 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 5.0 5.5 6.0 6.5 7.0 7.5 8.0 8.5 ppm7.6 7.8 8.0 8.2 8.4 8.6 8.8 ppm Appendix A.8 The 1H NMR D 2O at 25 \u00baC. 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 5.0 5.5 6.0 6.5 7.0 7.5 8.0 8.5 9.0 9.5 ppm8.2 8.4 8.6 8.8 9.0 Appendix 1H Appendix 1H of 47MESRBN in D 2O at 25 \u00baC. 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 ppm Appendix A.16 The 1H NMR spectrum Appendix 1H in D 2O at 25 \u00baC. 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1ppm Appendix A.20 The 1H NMR in D 2O at 25 \u00baC. 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 ppm Appendix A.22 The 1H NMR 25 \u00baC . ppm 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 ppm200180160140120100806040200 133 Appendix B.5 The 13C NMR Appendix 13C Appendix 13C D 2O at 25 \u00baC. ppm 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 ppm200180160140120100806040200 Appendix B.14 The 2D HMQC at 25 \u00baC . ppm 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 ppm200180160140120100806040200 Appendix B.16 The 2D HMQC 2O at 25 \u00baC. ppm 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 ppm200180160140120100806040200 138 Appendix B.17 The 2D HMQC Appendix 195Pt-1H D 2O at 25 \u00baC. ppm 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 ppm-1600-1800-2000-2200-2400-2600-2800-3000-3200-3400-3600-3800-4000 Appendix C.15 The 195Pt-1H HMQC 2O at 25 \u00baC. ppm 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 ppm-1600-1800-2000-2200-2400-2600-2800-3000-3200-3400-3600-3800-4000 146 Appendix C.16 The 195Pt-1H HMQC 2O at 25 \u00baC. ppm 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 ppm-1600-1800-2000-2200-2400-2600-2800-3000-3200-3400-3600-3800-4000 Appendix C.19 The 195Pt NMR spectrum Appendix 195Pt-1H APPENDIX D Appendix D.1 The ESI-MS of 56MESS. 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 300 400 500 600 700 ESI-MS of 5MESS. 152 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 UV-Vis spectrum of 350 400 (nm) Appendix E.2 The UV-Vis spectrum of 5MESRBN. 350 400 (nm) Appendix E.3 The UV-Vis spectrum of 47MESRBN. -0.0500.050.10.150.20.250.30.35 350 400 Wavelength (nm)Absorbance 163 Appendix E.4 The UV-Vis spectrum of 47MESPN. 350 400 (nm)Absorbance Appendix E.5 The UV-Vis spectrum of 47MERPN. -0.100.10.20.30.40.50.60.7 350 400 wavelength (nm)Absorbance 164 Appendix E.6 The UV-Vis spectrum of 3478MESRBN. 350 400 (nm)Absorbance Appendix E.7 The UV-Vis spectrum of 3478MESPN. -0.100.10.20.30.40.50.6 400 t h 165 Appendix E.8 The UV-Vis spectrum of 3478MERPN. -0.0500.050.10.150.20.250.30.350.40.45 200 250 300 350 400 wa v e l e ngt h ( nm) Appendix E.9 The UV-Vis h Appendix E.10 The UV-Vis spectrum of PHENSRBN. 00.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.8 200 250 300 350 400 wa v e l e ngt h ( nm) Appendix E.11 The UV-Vis spectrum 350 400 wavelength (nm)Absorbance 167 Appendix E.12 The UV-Vis spectrum of PHENSPN. 350 400 (nm)Absorbance Appendix E.13 The UV-Vis spectrum of PHENRPN. -0.500.511.52 200 350 400 (nm)Absorbance 168 F Appendix 56MERRBN 5,6-Me 2phen. -0.005-0.004-0.003-0.002-0.00100.0010.0020.0030.004 200 250 300 350 400 450 500 550 600 Wavelength (nm)LD (a.u) Appendix F.8 The stretch LD spectrum of 4,7-Me 2phen. 00.0010.0020.0030.0040.0050.006 200 250 300 350 400 450 500 550 600 Wavelength (nm)LD (a.u) 172 Appendix F.9 The stretch LD spectrum of 3,4,7,8-Me 4-phen. -0.004-0.00200.0020.0040.0060.008 200 250 300 350 400 450 500 550 600 650 700 wavelength (nm)LD (a.u) Appendix F.10 The stretch LD spectrum of phen. 200 300 400 500 600 700 wavelength (nm)LD (a.u) 173 REFERENCES (1) Knudson, A.
