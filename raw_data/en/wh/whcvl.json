In the 1970s and 1990s, before the passage of DSHEA, FDA made two attempts, both of which were rejected by Congress and the courts. In the current NDI draft guidance, the agency attempts yet another end-run around the law by proposing the following: - Re-characterizing many existing dietary ingredients as new dietary ingredients by expanding the definition of \"chemically altered\" to classify innovations in manufacturing as being chemical alterations; - Requiring physical proof with \"material evidence\" that an ingredient was actually available in the market before 1994, and thus exempt from the NDI requirements; - Prohibiting bio-identical synthetic versions of botanical compounds from being classified as dietary ingredients at all; - Requiring a separate notification for each new product, as opposed to just the dietary ingredient; and - Declaring The Redbook, the official textbook for evaluating food additives which has a \"significantly higher threshold\" for safety than the \"reasonable expectation of safety\" established under DSHEA, as \"authoritative for demonstrating the safety of NDIs.\" Additionally, FDA wants to impose a risk-benefit standard for determining the safety of new ingredients, similar to what it used to remove ephedra from the market, which would allow FDA to evaluate the benefits of a product claimed by the manufacturer against the perceived risks\u2014another attempt to challenge Congress' intent for the law. \"It is time for FDA to reconsider its efforts to redistribute the safety burdens allocated by Congress in DSHEA, and to recognize that the pre-market paradigm of food additives is not what Congress intended for dietary supplements,\" the authors concluded.
