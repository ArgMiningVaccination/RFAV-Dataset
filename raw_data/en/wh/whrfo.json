IMDRF MDCE WG/N56FINAL:2019 (formerly GHTF/SG5/N2R8:2007) October 10 , 2019 Page 4 of 30 1.0 Introduction This document supersedes an earlier version produced under the Global Harmonization Task Force (GHTF) with the same title in May, 2007(GHTF/SG5/N2R8:2007). What is clinical evaluation? Clinical evaluation is a set of ongoing activities that use scientifically sound methods for the assessment and analysis of clinical data to verify the safety, clinical performance and/or effectiveness of the medical device when used as intended by the manufacturer. When is clinical evaluation undertaken? Clinical evaluation is an ongoing process conducted throughout the life cycle of a medical device. It is first performed during the development of a medical device in order to identify data that need to be generated for regulatory purposes and will inform if a new device clinical investigation is necess ary, together with the outcomes which need to be studied. It is then repeated periodically as new safety , clinical performance and/or effectiveness information about the medical device is obtained during its use. This information is fed into the ongoing risk management process (according to ISO 14971:2007) and may result in changes to the manufacturer's risk assessment , clinical investigation documents, Instructions for Use and post market activities. Why is clinical evaluation important? When placing a medical device on the market , the manufacturer must have demonstrated through the use of appropriate conformity assessment procedures that the medical device complies with the Essential Principles of Safety and Performance of Medical Devices (the Essential Principles). Generally, it is expected that the manufacturer has demonstrated the medical device achieves its intended performance during use according to its labelling (i.e. information supplied by the manufacturer) and that the known and foreseeable risks are minimised and acceptable when weighed against the benefits . Any claims made about the medical device's safety, clinical performance and/or effectiveness should be supported by suitable evidence. With regard to post market activities, manufacturers are expected to implement and maintain surveillance programs that routinely monitor the safety, clinical performance and/or effectiveness of the medical device as part of their Quality Management System. The scope and nature of such post market surveillance should be appropriate to the medical device and its intended use. Using data generated from such programs (e.g. safety reports, including adverse event reports; results from published literature, any further clinical investigations ), a manufacturer should periodically review performance, safety and the benefit- risk assessment for the medical device through a clinical evaluation, and update the clinical evidence accordingly. This ongoing clinical evaluation process should allow manufacturers to communicate with conformity assessment bodies and regulatory authorities in accordance with local reporting requirements any information that has an important bearing on the benefit -risk assessment of the medical device or IMDRF MDCE WG/N56FINAL:2019 (formerly GHTF/SG5/N2R8:2007) October 10 , 2019 Page 5 of 30 that would indicate a need for labelling changes regarding contraindications, warnings, precautions or instructions for use etc. What is the process? To conduct a clinical evaluation, a manufacturer needs to: \u00b7 identify the Essential Principles that require support from relevant clinical data; \u00b7 identify available clinical data relevant to the medical device and its intended use; \u00b7 evaluate (appraise and analyses ) clinical data in terms of its suitability and contribution to demonstrating the safety , clinical performance and/or effectiveness of the medical device in relation to its intended use; \u00b7 generate clinical data needed to address remaining questions of safety, clinical performance and/or effectiveness; \u00b7 bring all the clinical data together to reach conclusions about the safety, clinical performance and/or effectiveness of the medical device. The results of this process are documented in a clinical evaluation report. The clinical evaluation report and the clinical data on which it is based serve as the clinical evidence that supports the marketing of the device. The clinical evidence, along w ith other design verification and validation documentation, device description, labelling, risk analysis and manufacturing information, is needed to allow a manufacturer to demonstrate conformity with the Essential Principles and is part of the technical documentation of a medical device. How detailed should the clinical evaluation be? A clinical evaluation should be thorough and objective (i.e. it should consider both favourable and unfavourable data), with the intention of demonstrating valid clinical evidence of the safety clinical performance, and/or effectiveness of the device. However, it is important to recognise that there is considerable diversity in the types and history of technologies used in medical devices and the risks posed by them. Many devices are developed or modified by incremental innovation, so they are not completely novel. Thus, it is often possible to draw on the clinical experience and literature reports of the safety, clinical performance and/or effectiveness of comparable devices to establish the clinical evidence, thereby reducing the need for clinical data generated through clinical investigation of the medical device in question. Similarly, it may be possible to use compliance with recognised standards to satisfy the clinical evidence requirements for devices based on technologies with well- established safety, clinical performance and/or effectiveness characteristics. The depth and extent of clinical evaluations should be appropriate to the nature, intended use and risks of the device in question. Therefore, this guidance is not intended to impose specific requirements. 2.0 Scope IMDRF MDCE WG/N56FINAL:2019 (formerly GHTF/SG5/N2R8:2007) October 10 , 2019 Page 6 of 30 The primary purpose of this document is to provide manufacturers with guidance on how to conduct and document the clinical evaluation of a medical device as part of the conformity assessment procedure prior to placing a medical device on the market as well as to support its ongoing marketing. It is also intended to provide guidance to regulators and other stakeholders when assessing clinical evidence provided by manufacturers. This document provides the following guidance: \u00b7 general principles of clinical evaluation; \u00b7 how to identify relevant clinical data to be used in a clinical evaluation; \u00b7 how to appraise and integrate clinical data into a summary; and \u00b7 how to document a clinical evaluation in a clinical evaluation report.

Technical Documentation: The documented evidence, normally an output of the quality management system that demonstrates compliance of a medical device to the Essential Principles. 5.0 General principles of clinical evaluation What is the scope of a clinical evaluation? The clinical evaluation is based on a comprehensive analysis of available pre - and post- market clinical data relevant to the intended use of the device in question, including safety, clinical performance and/or effectiveness data. This includes data specific to the dev ice in question as well as any data relating to devices claimed as comparable by the manufacturer. The evaluation must also address any clinical claims made about the device, the adequacy of product labelling and product information (particularly contraindications, precautions/warnings), and the suitability of instructions for use. Before a clinical evaluation is undertaken the manufacturer should define its scope, based on the Essential Principles that need to be addressed from a clinical perspective. Considerations should include: \u00b7 whether there are any design features of the medical device or target treatment IMDRF MDCE WG/N56FINAL:2019 (formerly GHTF/SG5/N2R8:2007) October 10 , 2019 Page 9 of 30 populations that require specific attention. The clinical evaluation should cover any design features that pose special performanc e or safety concerns (e.g. presence of medicinal, human or animal components), the intended purpose and application of the medical device (e.g. target treatment group and disease, proposed warnings, contraindications and method of application) and the specific claims made by the manufacturer about the safety, clinical performance and/or effectiveness of the device. The scope of the clinical evaluation will need to be informed by and cross referenced to the manufacturer's risk management documents. The risk management documents are expected to identify the risks associated with the medical device and how such risks have been addressed. The clinical evaluation is expected to address the significance of any risks that remain after design risk mitigation str ategies have been employed by the manufacturer; \u00b7 whether data from comparable devices can be used to support the safety, clinical performance and/or effectiveness of the device in question. Comparable devices should be considered with respect to relevant aspects including intended use, technical and/or biological characteristics to inform the clinical evaluation of the device. These characteristics should be broadly similar, but consideration must be given to how differences may affect the safety, clinical performance and/or effectiveness of the device. In some circumstances, these characteristics are similar to such an extent that there would be no clinically meaningful difference in the safety, clinical performance and/or effectiveness of the medical device . Intended use includes the clinical condition being treated, the severity and stage of disease, the site of application to/in the body and the patient population. T echnical characteristics include the design, specifications, physiochemical properties including energy intensity, deployment methods, critical performance requirements , and principles of operation. B iological characteristics include biocompatibility of materials in contact with body fluids/tissues. Some additional considerations for comparability are given in Appendix A. The manufacturer is also expected to assess the supporting nonclinical information and summarise it within the clinical evaluation report. (Note: the clinical evaluation is not intended to comprehensively assess the technical and biological characteristics ); and \u00b7 the data source(s) and type(s) of data to be used in the clinical evaluation. Manufacturers may be able to leverage existing information drawn from any one or combination of data sources set out in Section 6.0. Factors that should be considered when choosing the type of data to be used in the clinical evaluation include the design, intended use and risks of the medical device; the developmental context of the technology on which the device is based (new vs established technology); and, for established technology, the proposed clinical application of that technology. Clinical evaluation of medical devices that are based on existing, well- established technologies and intended for an established use of the technology is most likely to rely on compliance with recognised standards and/or literature review and/or clinical experience of comparable devices. High risk medical devices, those based on technologies where there is little or no experience, and thos e that extend the intended purpose of an existing technology (i.e. a new clinical use) are most likely to require clinical IMDRF MDCE WG/N56FINAL:2019 (formerly GHTF/SG5/N2R8:2007) October 10 , 2019 Page 10 of 30 investigation data. The manufacturer will need to give consideration to the advantages and limitations of each data type. How is a clinical evaluation performed? Once the scope has been defined, there are three discrete stages in performing a clinical evaluation (Figure 1): \u00b7 identification of pertinent standards and clinical data; \u00b7 appraisal of each individual data set, in terms of its relevance, applicability, quality and clinical significance; and \u00b7 analysis of the individual data sets, whereby conclusions are reached about the safety, clinical performance and/or effectiveness and presentational aspects (labelling, patient inform ation and instructions for use) of the medical device. Each of these stages is covered in separate sections later in this document. At the end of the clinical evaluation , a report is prepared and combined with the relevant clinical data to form the clinical evidence for the medical device. If the manufacturer concludes there is insufficient clinical evidence to be able to declare conformity with the Essential Principles, the manufacturer will need to generate additional data (e.g. conduct a clinical investigation, broaden the scope of literature searching) to address the deficiency. In this respect clinical evaluation can be an iterative process. Who should perform the clinical evaluation? The clinical evaluation should be conducted by a suitably qualified individual or individuals. A manufacturer must be able to justify the choice of the evaluator(s) through reference to qualifications and documented experience. As a general principle, evaluators should possess knowledge of the following: \u00b7 the device technology and its application; \u00b7 research methodology (clinical investigation design and biostatistics); and \u00b7 diagnosis and management of the conditions intended to be treated or diagnosed by the medical device. Wh at about in vitro diagnostic dev ices (IVDDs)? Clinical evaluation should be performed for in vitro diagnostic devices as part of conformity assessment to the Essential Principles in a manner similar to other medical devices. The basic principles of objective review of clinical data will apply as described in this guidance document. However, IVDDs offer some unique definitions and concepts, which have been defined in the GHTF/SG5/N6:2012: Clinical Evidence for IVD medical devices - Key Definitions and Concepts, as well as challenges in demonstrating clinical evidence and delineating when the elements of clinical evidence are appropriate for the IVDDs, which have been addressed in the GHTF/SG5/N7:2012: Clinical Evidence for IVD medical devices - IMDRF MDCE WG/N56FINAL:2019 (formerly GHTF/SG5/N2R8:2007) October 10 , 2019 Page 11 of 30 EPs = Essential Principles of safety and performance of medical devices * - Conformance to performance standards may be sufficient to demonstrate compliance to relevant Essential Principles - In some circumstances with justification, nonclinical data may inform if new or additional clinical data are necessary Figure 1 Stages of a Clinical Evaluation Stage 1* Identify pertinent data from - literature searching &/or - clinical experience &/or - clinical investigation Stage 2 Appraisal of individual data sets - suitability - contribution of results to demonstration of safety, clinical performance and/or effectiveness Is clinical evidence sufficient to be able to declare conformity with relevant EPs?

What about Software as a Medical Device (SaMD)? SaMD can best be described as software that utilizes an algorithm (logic, set of rules, or model) that operates on data input (digitized content) to produce an output that is intended for medical purposes as defined by the SaMD manufacturer. Like other medical device, SaMD clinical evaluation should be consistent with this document. Moreover, IMDRF developed a specific guidance document \"Software as a Medical Device (SaMD): Clinical Evaluation SaMD WG/N41:2017\" to address more detailed instructions on SaMD clinical evaluation. 6.0 Sources of data/documentation used in a clinical evaluation (Stage 1) Data relevant to the clinical evaluation may be held by the manufacturer or a third party , or be available in the scientific literature , for the device in question or for comparable devices. The manufacturer is responsible for identifying data relevant to the medical device and determining the types and amount of data needed for the clinical evaluation. 6.1 Data generated through literature searching Literature searching can be used to identify published clinical data that is not in the possession of the manufacturer that may assist the manufacturer to establish acceptable safety, clinical performance and/or effectiveness of a medical device. The data generated through literature searching may relate directly to the device in question (e.g. reports of clinical investigations of the device in question that have been performed by third parties, adverse event reports) or to comparable devices. For some medical devices, clinical data generated through literature searching will represent the greater part (if not all) of the clinical evidence. Thus, when conducting a literature review reasonable efforts should be made to conduct a comprehensive search. Published data will need to be assessed with respect to its possible contribution and weighting in establishing both the performance of the device in question and its safety. Papers considered unsuitable for demonstration of clinical performance and/or effectiveness because of poor study design or inadequate analysis may still contain data suitable for assessing the safety of the medical device. The key elements of literature searching The search strategy should be based on carefully constructed review questions. A protocol should be developed to identify, select and collate relevant publications to address these questions. This should be developed and executed by persons with expertise in information retrieval, having due regard to the scope of the clinical evaluat ion set out by the manufacturer. The involvement of information retrieval experts will help to maximise data retrieval. The literature search protocol should include: IMDRF MDCE WG/N56FINAL:2019 (formerly GHTF/SG5/N2R8:2007) October 10 , 2019 Page 13 of 30 \u00b7 the sources of data that will be used and a justification for their choice; \u00b7 the extent of any searches of scientific literature databases (the database search strategy); \u00b7 the selection/criteria to be applied to published literature and justification for their choice; and \u00b7 strategies for addressing the potential for duplication of data across multiple publications. Once the literature search has been executed, a report should be compiled to present the results of the search. A copy of the protocol should be included and any deviations noted. A possible format for the literature search report is located at Appendix B. It is important that the literature search is documented to such a degree that the methods can be appraised critically, the results can be verified, and the search reproduced if necessary. A possible methodology is presented in Appendix C. What data/documentation from the literature search should be included in the clinical evaluation? The following documentation should be used in the clinical evaluation by the clinical evaluator: \u00b7 the literature search protocol; \u00b7 the literature search report; and \u00b7 published articles and other references identified as being relevant to the device in question and suitable for evaluation. The literature search protocol, the literature search report and copies of relevant references become part of the clinical evidence and, in turn, the technical documentation for the medical device. With respect to the clinical evaluation, it is important that the clinical evaluator be able to assess the degree to which the selected papers reflect the intended application/use of the device, etc. Copies of the actual papers and references are necessary to allow the evaluator to review the methodology employed (potential sources of bias in the data), the reporting of results and the validity of conclusions drawn from the investigation or report. Abstracts may lack sufficient detail to allow these issues to be assessed thoroughly and independently. 6.2 Data generated through clinical experience These types of clinical data are generated through clinical use that is outside the conduct of clinical investigations and may relate to either the device in question or comparable devices. Such types of data may include: \u00b7 post market surveillance reports, registries or medical records (which may contain unpublished long term safety, clinical performance and/or effectiveness data); \u00b7 adverse events databases (held by either the manufacturer or regulatory authorities); and \u00b7 details of clinically relevant field corrective actions (e.g. recalls, notifications, hazard alerts). The value of clinical experience data is that it provides real world experience obtained in larger, IMDRF MDCE WG/N56FINAL:2019 (formerly GHTF/SG5/N2R8:2007) October 10 , 2019 Page 14 of 30 heterogeneous and more complex populations, with a broader (and potentially less experienced) range of end-users than is usually the case with clinical investigations1. The data are most useful for identifying less common but serious device- related adverse events; providing long term information about safety, clinical performance and/or effectiveness including durability da ta and information about failure modes; and elucidating the end-user \"learning curve\". It is also a particularly useful source of clinical data for low risk devices that are based on long standing, well-characterized technology and, therefore, unlikely to be the subject of either reporting in the scientific literature or clinical investigation. How may clinical experience data/documentation be used in the clinical evaluation? If a manufacturer chooses to use clinical experience data it is important that a ny reports or collations of data contain sufficient information to be able to undertake a rational and objective assessment of the information and make a conclusion about its significance with respect to the safety, clinical performance and/or effectiveness of the device. Reports of clinical experience that are not adequately supported by data, such as anecdotal reports or opinion, should not be used. Post market surveillance reports are compiled by the manufacturer and often include details of the medical device's regulatory status (countries in which the device is marketed and date of commencement of supply), regulatory actions undertaken during the reporting period (e.g. recalls, notifications), a tabulation of adverse events (particularly serious adverse events , stratified into whether the manufacturer considers them to be device- related or not) and estimates of the incidence of adverse events. Post -marketing data about adverse events are generally more meaningful when related to usage but caution is needed because the extent of reporting may vary considerably between countries. The analyses of data within these reports may, for some medical devices, provide reasonable assurance of safety, clinical performance and/or effectiveness . It may be helpful to provide a table summarizing device- related adverse events, paying particular attention to serious adverse events, with comments on whether observed device- related adverse events are predictable on the basis of the mode of action of the medical device. Identified hazards not previously considered in the risk management documentation must be addressed , describing additional mitigation required (e.g. design modific ation, labelling changes, etc). Registries that fit the IMDRF definition an d qualifiers have potential to be used for regulatory decision making (IMDRF/REGISTRY WG/N33 FINAL: 2016 - Principles of International System of Registries Linked to Other Data Sources and Tools ). To support regulatory purposes, the quality and robustness of registry data used must be carefully assessed. Guidance has been provided on methodological principles in the clinical evaluation across the device lifecycle using 1 In contrast, clinical investigations involve the use of specific inclusion criteria to create a homogenous population to reduce sources of variation and, therefore, increase confidence that the outcomes observed in the investigation are due to intervention with the device in question. Also, investigators participating in the investigation are chosen on the basis of their expertise and competence and often undergo training over and above that available to other end- users of the device. IMDRF MDCE WG/N56FINAL:2019 (formerly GHTF/SG5/N2R8:2007) October 10 , 2019 of 30 international registries (IMDRF/Registry WG/N42FINAL:2017 - Methodological Principles in the Use of International Medical Device Registry Data), and the use of registry- generated data in support of regulatory decisions (IMDRF/Registry WG/N46 FINAL: 2018 - Tools for Assessing the Usability of Registries in Support of Regulatory Decision-Making). 6.3 Data from clinical investigations The guidance included within this section applies to clinical investigations carried out by or on behalf of a manufacturer specifically for the purposes of conformity assessment in accordance with applicable regulations. Such clinical investigations are generally expected to be designed, conducted and reported in accordance with ISO 14155:2011, Clinical investigation of medical devices for human subjects -- Good clinical practice , or to a comparable standard, and in compliance with local regulations. It is recognised that where manufacturers source clinical investigation data reported in the scientific literature (i.e. investigations of either the device in question or comparable devices that are undertaken by a third party), the documentation readily available to the manufacturer for inclusion in the clinical evaluation is likely to be no more than the published paper itself. What clinical investigation documentation/data should be used in the clinical evaluation? Where a clinical investigation has been carried out by or on behalf of a manufacturer, it is expected that documentation relating to the design, ethical and regulatory approvals, conduct, results and conclusions of the investigation needed for the clinical evaluation will be available for consideration, as appropriate. These may include: \u00b7 the clinical investigation plan; \u00b7 clinical investigation plan amendments and the rationale for these changes; \u00b7 the relevant Ethics Committee documentation, opinion(s) and comments for each investigation site, including a copy of the approved informed consent form(s) and patient information documents; \u00b7 case report forms, monitoring and audit records; \u00b7 Regulatory Authority approvals and associated correspondence as required by applicable regulations; \u00b7 Documents related to financial disclosure, financial agreements or conflict of interests ; and \u00b7 the signed and dated final clinical investigation report. Th e clinical investigation plan sets out how the study was intended to be conducted. It contains important information about the study design such as the selection and assignment of participants to treatment, masking (blinding of participants and investigators) and measurement of responses to treatment, which may be important sources of bias that can be assessed when trying to determine the actual performance of the medical device. In addition , the clinical investigation plan sets out the intended participant follow-up, approac hes to statistical analyses and methods for recording outcomes, which may impact on the quality, completeness and significance of results obtained for performance and safety outcomes. Also, by having the clinical investigation plan, its amendments and the final clinical IMDRF MDCE WG/N56FINAL:2019 (formerly GHTF/SG5/N2R8:2007) October 10 , 2019 Page 16 of 30 investigation report available, the evaluator will be able to assess the extent to which the investigation was conducted as planned and, where deviations of from the original plan have occurred, the impact those deviations had on the veracity of the data generated and the inferences that can be drawn about the safety, clinical performance and/or effectiveness of the medical device from the investigation. The final clinical investigation report should be signed by its author and appropriate reviewers to provide assurance that the final clinical investigation report is an accurate reflection of the conduct and results of the clinical investigation. Another important consideration of the evaluation will be to assess whether the conduct of the investigation was in accordance with the current applicable ethical standards that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki and in accordance with applicable regulations. Clinical investigations not in compliance with applicable ethical standards or regulations should be rejected. The reasons for rejection of the investigation should be noted in the report. 7.0 Appraisal of clinical data (Stage 2) The purpose of undertaking appraisal of the data is to understand the merits and limitations of the clinical data. Each piece of data is appraised to determine its suitability to address questions about the medical device, and its contribution to demonstrating the safety, clinical performance and/or effectiveness of the device (including any specific claims about safety, clinical performance and/or effectiveness ). What should the appraisal cover? The data needs to be assessed for its quality and its relevance to the device in question including its intended use (i.e. the data must be either generated for the device in question or for a comparable device). In addition, any reports or collations of data should contain sufficient information for the evaluator to be able to undertake a rational and objective assessment of the infor mation and make a conclusion about its significance with respect to the safety, clinical performance and/or effectiveness of the device in question. F urther appraisal needs to be undertaken to determine the contribution of each data subset to establishing the safety, clinical performance and/or effectiveness of the medical device. The evaluator should examine the methods used to generate/collect the data and assess the extent to which the observed effect (performance or safety outcome(s)) can be considered to be due to intervention with the medical device or due to confounding influences (e.g. natural course of the underlying medical condition, concomitant treatment(s)) or bias 2. The evaluator should also assess whether clinical data are collected in conformance with the applicable regulatory requirements or other relevant standards (ISO 14155:2011) and whether clinical data are applicable to the population for which the marketing authorization is being sought. Refer to Appendix D for details regarding considerations of data from various jurisdictions. 2 Bias is a systematic deviation of an outcome measure from its true value, leading to either an overestimation or underestimation of a treatment's effect. It can originate from, for example, the way patients are allocated to IMDRF MDCE WG/N56FINAL:2019 (formerly GHTF/SG5/N2R8:2007) October 10 , 2019 Page 17 of 30 treatment, the way treatment outcomes are measured and interpreted, and the recording and reporting of data There is no single, well-established method for appraising clinical data. Therefore, the evaluator should identify, in advance, the appropriate criteria to be applied for a specific circumstance. These criteria should be applied consistently. Some examples to assist with the formulation of criteria are given in Appendix E. For many lower risk medical devices and devices based on long standing technology, the available data may be qualitative rather than quantitative in nature, so the evaluation criteria should be adjusted accordingly. The criteria adopted for the appraisal should be justified by the evaluator. Although there will be some overlap of safety, clinical performance and/or effectiveness data, the data should be categorized to allow for separate analysis. Additional categories may also be needed, depending on the nature and intended use of the medical device to address additional claims. The data should also be weighted according to its relative contribution. An example of a method of data appraisal is shown in Appendix F. 8.0 Analysis of the clinical data (Stage 3) The goal of the analysis stage is to make a benefit/risk determination if the appraised data sets available for a medical device collectively demonstrate the safety, clinical performance and/or effectiveness of the device in relation to its intended use. The methods available for analysis of clinical data generally are either quantitative or qualitative. Given the context within which most medical devices are developed (i.e. limited need for clinical investigations because of incremental changes in device design and therefore high use of literature and experience data), it is most likely that qualitative (i.e. descriptive) methods will need to be used. Any evaluation criteria developed and assigned during the appraisal stage can be used to identify those sets of data which may be considered to be pivotal to the demonstration of the safety, clinical performance and/or effectiveness of the medical device, respectively. It may be useful to explore the results of the pivotal datasets, looking for consistency of results across particular device performance characteristics and identified risks. If the different datasets report similar outcomes, certainty about the clinical performance and/or effectiveness increases. If different results are observed across the datasets, it will be helpful to determine the reason for such differences. Regardless, all data sets should be included. As a final step the evaluator should consider the basis on which it can be demonstrated that the combined data confirm: \u00b7 the medical device performs as intended by the manufacturer; \u00b7 the medical device does not pose any undue safety concerns to either the recipient or end -user; \u00b7 any risks associated with the use of the device are acceptable when weighed against the benefits to the patient; \u00b7 compliance with the relevant Essential Principles ; and \u00b7 whether post market clinical follow up or post approval study is necessary. IMDRF MDCE WG/N56FINAL:2019 (formerly GHTF/SG5/N2R8:2007) October 10 , 2019 Page 18 of 30 Such considerations should take into account the number of patients exposed to the medical device, the type and adequacy of patient monitoring, the number and severity of adverse events, the adequacy of the estimation of associated risk for each identified hazard, the severity and natural history of the condition being diagnosed or treated. The availability of alternative diagnostic modalities or treatments and current standard of care should also be taken into consideration. The product l abelling should be reviewed to ensure they are consistent with the data and that all the hazards and other clinically relevant information have been identified appropriately. 9.0 The Clinical Evaluation Report At the completion of the clinical evaluation process a report should be compiled that outlines the scope and context of the evaluation; the inputs (clinical data); the appraisal and analysis stages; and conclusions about the safety, clinical performance and/or effectiveness of the device in question. The clinical evaluation report should contain suffic ient information to be read as a standalone document by an independent party (e.g. regulatory authority or notified body). It is important that the report outline: \u00b7 the technology on which the medical device is based, the intended use of the medical device and any claims made about the device's safety, clinical performance and/or effectiveness ; \u00b7 the nature and extent of the clinical data that has been evaluated; and \u00b7 how the referenced information (recognised standards and/or clinical data) demonstrate the safety, clinical performance and/or effectiveness of the device in question. The clinical evaluation report should be signed and dated by the evaluator(s) and accompanied by the manufacturer's justification of the choice of evaluator. A suggested format for the clinical evaluation report is located at Appendix G. Again, it should be noted that the level of detail in the report content can vary according to the scope of the clinical evaluation. For example, where a manufacturer relies on clinical data for a comparable device which has been the subject of an earlier clinical evaluation (for which the manufacturer holds the evaluation report), it may be possible to cross -reference the data summary and analysis sections to the earlier clinical evaluation repo rt, which also becomes part of the clinical evidence for the device in question.

However, the applicability of the clinical data may be dependent on differences in regulatory requirements, intrinsic and extrinsic factors. 1. Considerations for differences in regulatory requirements The clinical inve stigation should be conducted in compliance with relevant regulations ( i.e. GCP ) in the jurisdictions where the investigation is performed. Consideration should be given to applicable GCP requirement s in jurisdictions where the investigational device is t o be reviewed for market approval. Aspects of the investigation that do not meet the applicable requirements in each jurisdiction should be explained and justified. 2. Considerations for intrinsic and extrinsic factors The intrinsic and extrinsic factors related to applicability may include: 1) Intrinsic factors: human genetic characteristics or demographic factors, such as race, age, gender, etc. 2) Extrinsic factors: clinical practice, social environment, natural environment, cultural factors, life behavioral factors, rare or regional diseases, etc. For factors that could have significant influence o n the clinical data, appropriate methods should be adopted to reduce variability. A justification should be provided for any residual variability. In some cases, additional clinical data may be required.

An example of possible appraisal criteria is given in Tables F1 and F2. The criteria may be worked through in sequence and a weighting assigned for each dataset. The data suitability criteria can be considered generic to all medical devices (Table F1), however the actual method used will vary according to the device considered. The evaluator should sort the data sets according to source type and then systematically consider those aspects that are most likely to impact on the interpretation of the results (Table F2). There is scope for the evaluator to determine what types of issues are most important in relation to the nature, history and intended clinical application of the medical device. The criteria used in the example below are based around the sorts of issues that could be considered for medical devices of higher risk, such as characteristics of the sample, methods of assessing the outcomes, the completeness and duration of follow-up, as well as the statistical and clinical significance of any results. In this example, the weightings would be used to assess the strength of the datasets' contribution to demonstrating overall safety, clinical performance and/or effectiveness of the medical device (Stage 3, see section 8). As a general guide in using this example, the more level 1 grades, the greater the weight of evidence provided by that particular dataset in comparison to other datasets, however, it is not intended that the relative weightings from each category be added into a total score. Table F1 Sample Appraisal Criteria for Suitability. Suitability Criteria Description Appropriate device Were the data generated from the device in question? Appropriate device application Appropriate patient group Acceptable report/data collation Was the device used for the same intended use (e.g., methods of deployment, application, etc.)?

The amount of information will differ according to the history of the technology. Where a completely new technology has been developed, this section would need to give an overview of the developmental process and the points in the development cycle at which clinical data have been generated. For long standing technology, a shorter description of the history of the technology (with appropriate references) could be used. Clearly state if the clinical data used in the evaluation are for a comparable device. Identify the comparable device(s) and provide a justification of the comparability, cross -referenced to the relevant nonclinical documentation that supports the claim.
