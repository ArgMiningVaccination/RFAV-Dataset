This means you do not need to enroll in Medicare Part D and pay extra for prescription drug coverage. If you decide to enroll in Medicare Part D later , you will not have to pay a penalty for late enrollment as long as you keep your FEHB coverage. However , if you choose to enroll in Medicare Part D, you can keep your FEHB coverage and will coordinate benefits with Medicare. Remember: If you are an annuitant and you cancel your FEHB coverage, you may not re-enroll in the FEHB Program. Please be advised If you lose or drop your FEHB coverage and go 63 days or longer without prescription drug coverage that' s at least as good as Medicare' s prescription drug coverage, your Medicare Part D premium will go up at least 1% per month for each month you did not have that coverage. For example, if you go 19 months without Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage, your premium will always be at least 19 percent higher than what most other people pay . Y ou will have to pay this higher premium as long as you have Medicare prescription drug coverage. In addition, you may also have to wait until the next Annual Coordinated Election Period (October 15 through December 7) to enroll in Medicare Part D. Medicar e' s Low Income Benefits For people with limited income and resources, extra help paying for a Medicare prescription drug plan is available.

The health coverage of this plan does meet the minimum value standard for the benefits the plan provides. Plain Language All FEHB brochures are written in plain language to make them easy to understand. Here are some examples: Except for necessary technical terms, we use common words. For instance, \"you\" means the enrollee or family member , \"we\" means MHBP . W e limit acronyms to ones you know . FEHB is the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. OPM is the United States Of fice of Personnel Management. If we use others, we tell you what they mean. Our brochure and other FEHB plans' brochures have the same format and similar descriptions to help you compare plans. Stop Health Car e Fraud! Fraud increases the cost of health care for everyone and increases your Federal Employees Health Benefits Program premium. OPM' s Of fice of the Inspector General investigates all allegations of fraud, waste, and abuse in the FEHB Program regardless of the agency that employs you or from which you retired. Pr otect Y ourself Fr om Fraud - Here are some things that you can do to prevent fraud: Do not give your Plan identification (ID) number over the telephone or to people you do not know , except to your doctor , other provider , or authorized plan or OPM representative. Let only the appropriate medical professionals review your medical record or recommend services. A void using health care providers who say that an item or service is not usually covered, but they know how to bill us to get it paid. Carefully review explanations of benefits (EOBs) that you receive from us. Periodically review your claims history for accuracy to ensure we have not been billed for services you did not receive. 3 2015 MHBP Introduction/Plain Language/Advisory Do not ask your doctor to make false entries on certificates, bills or records in order to get us to pay for an item or service. If you suspect that a provider has char ged you for services you did not receive, billed you twice for the same service, or misrepresented any information, do the following: - Call the provider and ask for an explanation. There may be an error . - If the provider does not resolve the matter , call us at 1-800-410-7778 and explain the situation. - If we do not resolve the issue: CALL - THE HEAL TH CARE FRAUD HOTLINE 877-499-7295 OR go to www .opm.gov/oig Y ou can write to: United States Office of Personnel Management Office of the Inspector General Fraud Hotline 1900 E Str eet NW Room 6400 W ashington , DC 20415-1 100 Do not maintain as a family member on your policy: - Y our former spouse after a divorce decree or annulment is final (even if a court order stipulates otherwise); or - Y our child age 26 or over (unless he/she was disabled and incapable of self support prior to age 26). If you have any questions about the eligibility of a dependent, check with your personnel of fice if you are employed, with your retirement of fice (such as OPM) if you are retired, or with the National Finance Center if you are enrolled under T emporary Continuation of Coverage. Fraud or material misrepresentation of material fact is prohibited under the Plan. Y ou can be prosecuted for fraud and your agency may take action against you. Examples of fraud include falsifying a claim to obtain FEHB benefits, trying to or obtaining services for yourself or for someone who is not eligible for coverage, or enrolling in the Plan when you are no longer eligible. If your enrollment continues after you are no longer eligible for coverage (i.e., you have separated from Federal service) and premiums are not paid, you will be responsible for all benefits paid during the period in which premiums were not paid. Y ou may be billed by your provider for services received. Y ou may be prosecuted for fraud for knowingly using health insurance benefits for which you have not paid premiums. It is your responsibility to know when you or a family member is no longer eligible to use your health insurance coverage. Pr eventing Medical Mistakes An influential report from the Institute of Medicine estimates that up to 98,000 Americans die every year from medical mistakes in hospitals alone. That' s about 3,230 preventable deaths in the FEHB Program a year . While death is the most tragic outcome, medical mistakes cause other problems such as permanent disabilities, extended hospital stays, longer recoveries, and even additional treatments. By asking questions, learning more and understanding your risks, you can improve the safety of your own health care, and that of your family members. T ake these simple steps: 1. Ask questions if you have doubts or concerns. - Ask questions and make sure you understand the answers. - Choose a doctor with whom you feel comfortable talking. - T ake a relative or friend with you to help you ask questions and understand answers. 2.

Be sure to write down what your doctor or pharmacist says. - Make sure your medicine is what the doctor ordered. Ask the pharmacist about your medicine if it looks dif ferent than you expected. - Read the label and patient package insert when you get your medicine, including all warnings and instructions. - Know how to use your medicine. Especially note the times and conditions when your medicine should and should not be taken. 3. Get the r esults of any test or pr ocedur e. - Ask when and how you will get the results of tests or procedures. - Don' t assume the results are fine if you do not get them when expected, be it in person, by phone, or by mail. - Call your doctor and ask for your results. - Ask what the results mean for your care. 4.

Never Events 5 2015 MHBP Introduction/Plain Language/Advisory When you enter the hospital for treatment of one medical problem, you don' t expect to leave with additional injuries, infections or other serious conditions that occur during the course of your stay . Although some of these complications may not be avoidable, too often patients suf fer from injuries or illnesses that could have been prevented if the hospital had taken proper precautions. W e have a benefit payment policy that encourages hospitals to reduce the likelihood of hospital-acquired conditions such as certain infections, severe bedsores and fractures; and reduce medical errors that should never happen. These conditions and errors are called \"Never Events\". When a Never Event occurs, neither your FEHB plan nor you will incur costs to correct the medical error . Y ou will not be billed for inpatient services related to treatment of specific hospital acquired conditions or for inpatient services needed to correct never events, if you use preferred providers. This policy helps to protect you from preventable medical errors and improve the quality of care you receive. 6 2015 MHBP Introduction/Plain Language/Advisory FEHB Facts Coverage information W e will not refuse to cover the treatment of a condition you had before you enrolled in this Plan solely because you had the condition before you enrolled.

This law mandates that you be enrolled for Self and Family coverage in the FEHB Program, if you are an employee subject to a court or administrative order requiring you to provide health benefits for your child(ren). If this law applies to you, you must enroll for Self and Family coverage in a health plan that provides full benefits in the area where your children live or provide documentation to your employing of fice that you have obtained other health benefits coverage for your children. If you do not do so, your employing of fice will enroll you involuntarily as follows: If you have no FEHB coverage, your employing of fice will enroll you for Self and Family coverage in the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service Benefit Plan' s Basic Option; If you have a Self Only enrollment in a fee-for -service plan or in an HMO that serves the area where your children live, your employing of fice will change your enrollment to Self and Family in the same option of the same plan; or Childr en' s Equity Act 8 2015 MHBP FEHB Facts If you are enrolled in an HMO that does not serve the area where the children live, your employing of fice will change your enrollment to Self and Family in the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service Benefit Plan' s Basic Option. As long as the court/administrative order is in ef fect, and you have at least one child identified in the order who is still eligible under the FEHB Program, you cannot cancel your enrollment, change to Self Only , or change to a plan that doesn' t serve the area in which your children live, unless you provide documentation that you have other coverage for the children. If the court/ administrative order is still in ef fect when you retire, and you have at least one child still eligible for FEHB coverage, you must continue your FEHB coverage into retirement (if eligible) and cannot cancel your coverage, change to Self Only , or change to a plan that doesn' t serve the area in which your children live as long as the court/administrative order is in ef fect. Contact your employing of fice for further information. The benefits in this brochure are ef fective January 1. If you joined this Plan during Open Season, your coverage begins on the first day of your first pay period that starts on or after January 1. If you changed plans or plan options during Open Season and you r eceive car e between January 1 and the effective date of coverage under your new plan or option, your claims will be paid according to the 2015 benefits of your old plan or option. However , if your old plan left the FEHB Program at the end of the year , you are covered under that plan' s 2014 benefits until the ef fective date of your coverage with your new plan. Annuitants' coverage and premiums begin on January 1. If you joined at any other time during the year , your employing of fice will tell you the ef fective date of coverage. When benefits and pr emiums start When you retire, you can usually stay in the FEHB Program. Generally , you must have been enrolled in the FEHB Program for the last five years of your Federal service. If you do not meet this requirement, you may be eligible for other forms of coverage, such as T emporary Continuation of Coverage (TCC). When you r etir e When you lose benefits Y ou will receive an additional 31 days of coverage, for no additional premium, when: Y our enrollment ends, unless you cancel your enrollment, or Y ou are a family member no longer eligible for coverage. Any person covered under the 31 day extension of coverage who is confined in a hospital or other institution for care or treatment on the 31st day of the temporary extension is entitled to continuation of the benefits of the Plan during the continuance of the confinement but not beyond the 60th day after the end of the 31 day temporary extension. Y ou may be eligible for spouse equity coverage or T emporary Continuation of Coverage (TCC). When FEHB coverage ends If you are divorced from a Federal employee or annuitant, you may not continue to get benefits under your former spouse' s enrollment. This is the case even when the court has ordered your former spouse to provide health coverage for you. However , you may be eligible for your own FEHB coverage under either the spouse equity law or T emporary Continuation of Coverage (TCC). If you are recently divorced or are anticipating a divorce, contact your ex-spouse' s employing or retirement of fice to get RI 70-5, the Guide T o Federal Benefits for T emporary Continuation of Coverage and Former Spouse Enrollees, or other information about your coverage choices. Y ou can also download the guide from OPM' s website, www .opm.gov/ healthcare-insurance/healthcare/plan-information/guides . Upon divor ce If you leave Federal service, T ribal employment, or if you lose coverage because you no longer qualify as a family member , you may be eligible for T emporary Continuation of Coverage (TCC). The Af fordable Care Act (ACA) did not eliminate TCC or change the TCC rules. For example, you can receive TCC if you are not able to continue your FEHB enrollment after you retire, if you lose your Federal job, if you are a covered dependent child and you turn 26 regardless of marital status, etc. T emporary Continuation of Coverage (TCC) 9 2015 MHBP FEHB Facts Y ou may not elect TCC if you are fired from your Federal or T ribal job due to gross misconduct. Enr olling in TCC .

V isit www .HealthCare.gov to compare plans and see what your premium, deductible, and out-of-pocket costs would be before you make a decision to enroll. Finally , if you qualify for coverage under another group health plan (such as your spouse' s plan), you may be able to enroll in that plan, as long as you apply within 30 days of losing FEHB Program coverage. Y ou may convert to a non-FEHB individual policy if: Y our coverage under TCC or the spouse equity law ends (If you canceled your coverage or did not pay your premium, you cannot convert); Y ou decided not to receive coverage under TCC or the spouse equity law; or Y ou are not eligible for coverage under TCC or the spouse equity law . If you leave Federal or T ribal service, your employing of fice will notify you of your right to convert.

How this plan works This Plan is a fee-for -service (FFS) plan. Y ou can choose your own physicians, hospitals, and other health care providers. W e give you a choice of enrollment in Standard Option or V alue Plan. W e reimburse you or your provider for your covered services, usually based on a percentage of the amount we allow . The type and extent of covered services, and the amount we allow , may be dif ferent from other plans. Read brochures carefully . General featur es of our Standard Option and V alue Plan W e have Network pr oviders Our fee-for -service plan of fers services through a network of health care providers. When you use Network providers, you will receive covered services at reduced cost. MHBP is solely responsible for the selection of Network providers in your area. Contact us at 1-800-410-7778 for the names of Network providers or to request a Network directory . Y ou can also go to our website, www . MHBP .com . Continued participation of any specific provider cannot be guaranteed. When you phone for an appointment, please remember to verify that the health care professional or facility is still a Network provider . If your doctor is not currently participating in the provider network, you can nominate him or her to join. Physician nomination forms are available on our website, or call us and we'll have a form sent to you. Y ou cannot change health plans outside of Open Season because of changes to the provider network. This Plan uses the Coventry Health Care National Network as its provider network in the state of Utah. In all other states, the Network providers are those that participate in the Aetna Choice POS II product. Services from providers outside the continental United States, Alaska and Hawaii will be considered at the Network benefit levels. If you receive non-covered services from a Network provider , the Network discount will not apply and the services will be excluded from coverage. T o save both you and the Plan money , we encourage the use of primary care physicians where available and appropriate. The Non-Network benefits are the regular benefits of this Plan. Network benefits apply only when you use a Network provider . Provider networks may be more extensive in some areas than others. W e cannot guarantee the availability of every specialty in all areas. If no Network provider is available, or you do not use a Network provider , the regular Non-Network benefits apply . The nature of the services (such as ur gent or emer gency situations) does not af fect whether benefits are paid as Network or Non-Network. However , we will provide the Network level of benefits for services you receive from Non-Network anesthesiologists (including Certified when inpatient services are provided in a Network hospital and when outpatient sur gical and emer gency treatment services are provided at a Network facility unless we indicate otherwise. W e will also provide the Network level of benefits for services you receive from a Non-Network radiologist related to preauthorized outpatient radiology procedures performed in a Network facility . Y ou will still be responsible for the dif ference between our allowance and the billed amount. Network pr oviders for mental health and substance abuse This Plan has a contract with Optum (formerly United Behavioral Health) to administer our mental health/substance abuse benefits. They have contracts with mental health professionals to provide these services. Network benefits apply only when you use a Network provider . Call us at 1-800-410-7778 for assistance with locating a Network provider . See Section 5(e). Other Participating Pr oviders This Plan of fers you access to certain Non-Network health care providers that have agreed to discount their char ges. These providers are available to you through MultiPlan and Three Rivers Provider Network (TRPN). Covered services at these participating providers are considered at the negotiated rate subject to applicable deductibles, copayments and coinsurance. Since these participating providers are not Network providers, Non-Network benefit levels will apply . Contact us at 1-800-410-7778 for more information about participating providers. How we pay pr oviders When you use a Network health care provider or facility , our Plan allowance is the negotiated rate for the service. Y ou are not responsible for char ges above the negotiated amount for covered services and supplies. Non-Network facilities and providers do not have special agreements with the Plan. Our payment is based on the Plan allowance for covered services. Y ou may be responsible for amounts over the allowance. 1 1 2015 MHBP Section 1 If Network providers are available where you receive care and you do not use them, your out-of-pocket expenses will increase. The Plan will base its allowance on a fee schedule that represents an average of the Network fee schedules for a particular service in a particular geographic area (see Plan allowance , Section 10, for further details). When we obtain discounts from participating providers, or through direct negotiations with other Non-Network providers, we pass along your share of the savings. W e apply the National Correct Coding Initiative (NCCI) edits published by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) in reviewing billed services and making Plan benefit payments for them. Y our Rights OPM requires that all FEHB Plans provide certain information to their FEHB members. Y ou may get information about us, our networks, providers, and facilities.

If you ar e hospitalized when your enr ollment begins The pre-service claim approval processes for inpatient hospital admissions (called precertification) and for other services, are detailed in this Section. A pr e-service claim is any claim, in whole or in part, that requires approval from us in advance of obtaining medical care or services. In other words, a pre-service claim for benefits (1) requires precertification, prior approval or a referral and (2) will result in a reduction of benefits if you do not obtain precertification, prior approval or a referral. W e make our determination based on nationally recognized clinical guidelines and standard criteria sets. These determinations can af fect what we pay on a claim. Y ou need prior Plan appr oval for certain services Pr ecertification is the process by which - prior to your inpatient hospital admission - we evaluate the medical necessity of your proposed stay and the number of days required to treat your condition. Unless we are misled by the information given to us, we won' t change our decision on medical necessity . In most cases, your physician or hospital will take care of precertification. Because you are still responsible for ensuring that your care is precertified, you should always ask your physician or hospital whether they have contacted us and that we have approved the admission. Inpatient hospital admission W e will reduce our benefits for the inpatient hospital stay by $500 if no one contacts us for precertification. If the stay is not medically necessary , we will not pay inpatient hospital benefits. If no one contacts us, we will decide whether the hospital stay was medically necessary . If we determine that the stay was medically necessary , we will pay the inpatient char ges, less the $500 penalty . W arning 17 2015 MHBP Section 3 If we determine that it was not medically necessary for you to be an inpatient, we will not pay inpatient hospital benefits.

T o file an appeal with OPM 22 2015 MHBP Section 3 Section 4. Y our costs for cover ed services This is what you will pay out-of-pocket for covered care. Cost-sharing is a general term used to refer to your out-of-pocket costs (e.g., deductible, coinsurance and copayments) for the covered care you receive. Cost sharing A copayment is a fixed amount of money you pay to the provider , facility , pharmacy , etc., when you receive certain services. Example: When you have Standard Option and see your primary care Network physician you pay a copayment of $20 per visit for adult members or $10 per visit for dependent children through age 21. Note: If the billed amount or the Plan allowance that providers we contract with have agreed to accept as payment in full is less than your copayment, you pay the lower amount. Copayment A deductible is a fixed amount of covered expenses you must incur for certain covered services and supplies before we start paying benefits for them. Copayments and coinsurance amounts do not count toward any deductible. When a covered service or supply is subject to a deductible, only the Plan allowance for the service or supply counts toward the deductible. Covered expenses are applied to the deductible in the order in which claims are processed, which may be dif ferent than the order in which services were actually rendered. The Standard Option calendar year deductible for covered services and supplies is $400 per person, limited to $800 per family , for services received from Network providers, and $600 per person, limited to $1,500 per family , for services received from Non-Network providers. The V alue Plan calendar year deductible for covered services and supplies is $600 per person, limited to $1,200 per family , for services received from Network providers, and $900 per person, limited to $1,800 per family , for services received from Non-Network providers. Under a family enrollment, the calendar year deductible is satisfied for all family members when the combined covered expenses applied to the deductible for all family members reach the respective per family limit. If the billed amount (or the Plan allowance that Network providers have agreed to accept as payment in full) is less than the remaining portion of your deductible, you pay the lower amount. Example: If the billed amount is $100, the provider has agreed to accept $80, and you have not paid any amount toward your calendar year deductible, you must pay $80. W e will apply $80 toward your deductible. W e will begin paying benefits once the remaining portion of your calendar year deductible has been satisfied. Note: If you change plans or plan options during Open Season and the ef fective date of your new plan or plan option is after January 1 of the next year , you do not have to start a new deductible under your old plan or plan option between January 1 and the ef fective date of your new plan or plan option. If you change options in this Plan during the year , we will credit the amount of covered expenses already applied toward the deductible of your old option to the deductible of your new option. If you change plans during the year , you must begin a new deductible under your new plan. Deductible Coinsurance is the percentage of our allowance that you must pay for your care. Coinsurance does not begin until you have met your calendar year deductible. Example: Y ou pay 30% of our allowance under Standard Option and 40% of our allowance under V alue Plan for Non-Network of fice visits. Coinsurance 23 2015 MHBP Section 4 If your provider routinely waives (does not require you to pay) your copayments, deductibles, or coinsurance, the provider is misstating the fee and may be violating the law . In this case, when we calculate our share, we will reduce the provider ' s fee by the amount waived. For example, if your physician ordinarily char ges $100 for a covered service but routinely waives your 30% coinsurance (Standard Option), the actual char ge is $70. W e will pay $49 (70% of the actual char ge of $70). T o help keep your coinsurance out-of-pocket costs to a minimum, we encourage you to call us at 1-800-410-7778 or visit our website at www .MHBP .com for assistance locating Network providers whenever possible. If your pr ovider r outinely waives your cost In some instances, a provider may ask you to sign a \"waiver\" prior to receiving care. This waiver may state that you accept responsibility for the total char ge for any care that is not covered by your health plan. If you sign such a waiver , whether you are responsible for the total char ge depends on the contracts that the Plan has with its providers. If you are asked to sign this type of waiver , please be aware that, if benefits are denied for the services, you could be legally liable for the related expenses. If you would like more information about waivers, please contact us at 1-800-410-7778. W aivers Our \"Plan allowance\" is the amount we use to calculate our payment for covered services. Fee- for -service plans arrive at their allowances in dif ferent ways, so their allowances vary . For more information about how we determine our Plan allowance, see the definition of Plan allowance in Section 10. Often, the provider ' s bill is more than a fee-for -service plan' s allowance. Whether or not you have to pay the dif ference between our allowance and the bill will depend on the provider you use. Network pr oviders agree to limit what they will bill you. Because of that, when you use a preferred provider , your share of covered char ges consists only of your deductible and coinsurance or copayment. Here is a Standard Option example: Y ou see a Network physician for an of fice visit who char ges $150, but our allowance is $100. Y ou are only responsible for your copayment. That is, you pay just $20 of our $100 allowance for an adult of fice visit. Because of the agreement, your Network physician will not bill you for the $50 dif ference between our allowance and his/her bill. Non-Network pr oviders , on the other hand, have no agreement to limit what they will bill you. When you use a Non-Network provider , you will pay your deductible and coinsurance - plus any dif ference between our allowance and char ges on the bill. Here is a Standard Option example: Y ou see a Non-Network physician who char ges $150 and our allowance is again $100. Because you've met your deductible, you are responsible for your coinsurance, so you pay 30% of our $100 allowance ($30). Plus, because there is no agreement between the Non-Network physician and us, the physician can bill you for the $50 dif ference between our allowance and his/her bill. For details on how we determine the Plan allowance, please see Section 10. Participating pr oviders agree to limit what they can collect from you. Y ou will still have to pay your deductible and coinsurance. These providers agree to write of f the dif ference between billed char ges and the discount amount. The following table illustrates the examples of how much you have to pay out-of-pocket for services from a Network physician vs. a Non-Network physician in a non-fully developed market area. The table uses our example of a service for which the physician char ges $150 and our allowance is $100. The table shows the amount you pay under Standard Option if you have met your calendar year deductible. Differ ences between our allowance and the bill 24 2015 MHBP Section 4 EXAMPLE Network physician Non-Network physician Physician' s char ge $150 $150 Our allowance W e set it at: $100 W e set it at: $100 W e Y es: T OT AL YOU P A Y $20 $80 If you receive services in a fully developed Network area and use a Non-Network physician, your out-of-pocket expenses may be greater . See Plan Allowance , Section 10 for more details. For those services with cost-sharing, we pay 100% of the Plan' s allowance for the remainder of the calendar year after your out-of-pocket expenses total these amounts: Standard Option $6,000 per person per calendar year; $12,000 per family per calendar year , for covered services and drugs from Network providers/facilities and pharmacies, combined $9,000 per person per calendar year; $18,000 per family per calendar year , for covered services and drugs from Non-Network providers/facilities and pharmacies, combined V alue Plan $6,600 per person per calendar year; $13,200 per family per calendar year , for covered services and drugs from Network providers/facilities and pharmacies, combined $10,000 per person per calendar year; $20,000 per family per calendar year , for covered services of Non-Network providers/facilities The following cannot be included in the accumulation of out-of-pocket expenses. Health care providers can bill you, and you are responsible to pay them even after your expenses exceed the limits described above: Expenses in excess of the Plan allowance or maximum benefit limitations Expenses for non-covered services, drugs and supplies Any amounts you pay because benefits have been reduced for non-compliance with this Plan' s cost containment requirements (see Y ou need prior Plan approval for certain services , Section 3) The dif ference in cost between a brand name drug and the generic equivalent Y our catastr ophic pr otection out-of-pocket maximum If you changed to this Plan during Open Season from a plan with a catastrophic protection benefit and the ef fective date of the change was after January 1, any expenses that would have applied to that plan' s catastrophic protection benefit during the prior year will be covered by your old plan if they are for care you received in January before your ef fective date of coverage in this Plan. If you have already met your old plan' s catastrophic protection benefit level in full, it will continue to apply until the ef fective date of your coverage in this Plan. If you have not met this expense level in full, your old plan will first apply your covered out-of-pocket expenses until the prior year ' s catastrophic level is reached and then apply the catastrophic protection benefit to covered out-of-pocket expenses incurred from that point until the ef fective date of your coverage in this Plan. Y our old plan will pay these covered expenses according to this year ' s benefits; benefit changes are ef fective January 1. Note: If you change options in this Plan during the year , we will credit the amount of covered expenses already accumulated toward the catastrophic out-of-pocket limit of your old option to the catastrophic protection limit of your new option. Carryover 25 2015 MHBP Section 4 If you change plans during the year , you must meet the catastrophic protection out-of-pocket maximum of your new plan in full before catastrophic protection benefits begin. W e will make diligent ef forts to recover benefit payments we made in error but in good faith. W e may reduce subsequent benefit payments to of fset overpayments. If we overpay you Facilities of the Department of V eterans Af fairs, the Department of Defense, and the Indian Health Service are entitled to seek reimbursement from us for certain services and supplies they provide to you or a family member .

For more information about preauthorization, please call us at 1-800-410-7778 or visit our website at www .MHBP .com . Be sure to read Section 4, Y our costs for covered services , for valuable information about how cost-sharing works. Also, read Section 9 about coordinating benefits with Medicare and other coverage. There are important features you should be aware of. These include: Who can write your pr escription? A licensed physician or dentist, and in the states allowing it, licensed or certified Physician Assistant, Nurse Practitioner and Psychologist must prescribe your medication. Wher e you can obtain them. Y ou may fill the prescription at a network pharmacy , a non-network pharmacy , or by mail for certain drugs. W e pay a higher level of benefits when you use a network pharmacy . - Network pharmacy - Present your Plan identification card at a network pharmacy to purchase prescription drugs. Y ou must have the pharmacy file the claim electronically for you in order to receive the network pharmacy level benefit. Call 1-800-410-7778 or check the electronic directory via www .MHBP .com to locate the nearest network pharmacy . - Non-Network pharmacy - Standard Option members may purchase prescriptions at pharmacies that are not part of our network.

W e use a formulary . A formulary is a list of generic and preferred drugs (see below) that are available through this plan. It places all FDA approved drugs into categories based on their clinical ef fectiveness, safety and cost and is designed to control costs for you and the Plan. The categories include: - Generic drug category includes primarily generic drugs; - Pr eferr ed drug category (also called \"formulary\") includes preferred brand name drugs; - Non-Pr eferr ed drug category (also called \"non-formulary\") includes non-preferred brand name drugs; - Specialty drug category (see description of Specialty drugs below). Occasionally , drugs may change from one category to another category , which can af fect your cost-share amount. W e will attempt to notify you when this occurs. When you need a prescription, share the formulary with your physician and request a Generic or Preferred category drug if possible. By choosing Generic or Preferred category drugs, you may decrease your out-of-pocket expenses. While all FDA-approved drugs are available to you, we may have formulary restrictions on certain drugs, including but not limited to, quantity limits, age limits, dosage limits, brand exception and preauthorization. T o request a copy of our current formulary , call us at 1-800-410-7778 or visit our website, www .MHBP .com . 76 2015 MHBP Standard Option and V alue Plan Section 5(f) Standard Option and V alue Plan A generic equivalent will be dispensed if it is available when you obtain your prescription from a network pharmacy or through our mail order drug program. If you choose a brand name medication for which a generic medication exists, you will pay your cost- share plus the dif ference in cost between the brand name and generic medication. If you have a medical condition that requires a brand name drug your prescribing physician must obtain a brand exception. For information on how to obtain a brand exception, you or your physician should call us at 1-800-410-7778 or visit our website, www .MHBP .com . If the exception is not approved, your cost-sharing will be greater . Why use generic drugs? A generic drug is the chemical equivalent to a brand name drug, yet it costs much less. Choosing generic drugs rather than brand name drugs can reduce your out-of-pocket expenses. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration sets quality standards for generic drugs to ensure that these drugs meet the same standards of quality and strength as brand name drugs. They must contain the same active ingredients, be equivalent in strength and dosage, and meet the same standards for safety , purity and ef fectiveness as the original brand name product. Generic drug incentive pr ogram . Y ou may be eligible for this program if you are currently taking a non-generic medication and switch to a generic replacement for that drug. If you qualify , you will receive a letter from CVS Caremark indicating that you can receive up to a 90-day supply of the generic drug at no cost to you. Y ou must obtain the generic replacement by the expiration date in the letter at a network retail pharmacy (up to three 30-day refills), or through our mail order drug program (one 90-day refill). Maintenance and long-term medications. A long-term maintenance medication is one that is taken regularly for chronic conditions or long-term therapy . A few examples include medications for managing high blood pressure, asthma, diabetes or high cholesterol. W e have a program that allows members to get up to 90-day refills at a CVS retail pharmacy for the same cost-sharing as mail order . Under the program, you may choose to get the initial prescription and two refills (up to a 30-day supply each) at a network retail pharmacy or through our mail order drug program (up to a 90-day supply). After the second refill at a retail pharmacy , additional refills must be obtained either from a CVS retail pharmacy or through our mail order drug program. Y ou will receive a letter after your second refill that describes your benefits and provides instructions on how to obtain additional refills in up to a 90-day supply . This program is required for V alue Plan members . Standard Option members may choose not to participate in this program by calling CVS Caremark at 1-866-623-1441. If you exceed three fills at a network retail pharmacy and have not advised us that you do not want to participate in this program, you may experience a delay in receiving your medication until you contact us. Ther e ar e dispensing limitations. All prescriptions will be limited to a 30-day supply for retail and a 90-day supply for mail order . Also, in most cases, refills cannot be obtained until 75% of the drug has been used. Occasionally , as part of regular review , we may recommend that the use of a drug is appropriate only with limits on its quantity , total dose, duration of therapy , age, gender or specific diagnoses. Since the prescription does not usually explain the reason your provider prescribed a medication, we may implement any of these limits and/or require preauthorization to confirm the intent of the prescriber . Pr eauthorization . W e require preauthorization for certain drugs. T o obtain a list of drugs that require preauthorization, please visit our website, www .MHBP .com or call 1-866-623-1441. W e periodically review and update the preauthorization drug list in accordance with guidelines set by the US Food & Drug Administration (FDA), as a result of new drugs, new generic drugs, new therapies and other factors. Consult with your physician or pharmacist to determine if there are alternate drugs that do not require preauthorization and are appropriate for you. T o request preauthorization, your physician may contact the CVS Caremark Preauthorization Department at 1-800-626-3046. CVS Caremark will work with your physician to obtain the information needed to evaluate the request. Y ou may contact CVS Car emark at 1-866 623-1441 for the status of your r equest and any questions you have r egarding pr eauthorization .

When appropriate, your pharmacist(s) and/or CVS Caremark may contact your physician(s) to discuss an alternative drug or treatment option, prescription drug compliance, and the best and most cost-ef fective use of services. In addition, we may perform a periodic review of prescriptions to help ensure your safety and to provide health education and support. Upon review , we may contact you or your provider(s) to discuss your current medical situation and may of fer assistance in coordinating care and treatment.

Y ou must raise eligibility issues with your Agency personnel/payroll of fice if you are an employee, your retirement system if you are an annuitant or the Of fice of W orkers' Compensation Programs if you are receiving W orkers' Compensation benefits. 98 2015 MHBP Section 8 Section 9. Coordinating benefits with Medicar e and other coverage Y ou must tell us if you or a covered family member has coverage under any other health plan or has automobile insurance that pays health care expenses without regard to fault. This is called \"double coverage\". When you have double coverage, one plan normally pays its benefits in full as the primary payor and the other plan pays a reduced benefit as the secondary payor . W e, like other insurers, determine which coverage is primary according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners' (NAIC) guidelines. For more information on NAIC rules regarding the coordinating of benefits, visit the NAIC website at www .NAIC.or g . When we are the primary payor , we will pay the benefits described in this brochure. When we are the secondary payor , we will determine our allowance. After the primary plan pays, we will pay what is left of our allowance, up to our regular benefit, or up to the member ' s responsibility as determined by the primary plan if there is no adverse ef fect on you (that is, you do not pay any more), whichever is less. W e will not pay more than our allowance. The combined payment from both plans may be less than (but will not exceed) the entire amount billed by the provider . The provision applies whether or not a claim is filed under the other coverage. When applicable, authorization must be given to this Plan to obtain information about benefits or services available from the other coverage, or to recover overpayments from other coverages. Please see Section 4, Y our costs for covered services , for more information about how we pay claims. When you have other health coverage TRICARE is the health care program for eligible dependents of military persons, and retirees of the military . TRICARE includes the CHAMPUS program. CHAMPV A provides health coverage to disabled V eterans and their eligible dependents. If TRICARE or CHAMPV A and this Plan cover you, we pay first. See your TRICARE or CHAMPV A Health Benefits Advisor if you have questions about these programs. If you are enrolled in the Uniformed Services Family Health Plan, MHBP is primary . Suspended FEHB coverage to enr oll in TRICARE or CHAMPV A: If you are an annuitant or former spouse, you can suspend your FEHB coverage to enroll in one of these programs, eliminating your FEHB premium. (OPM does not contribute to any applicable plan premiums.) For information on suspending your FEHB enrollment, contact your retirement of fice. If you later want to re-enroll in the FEHB Program, generally you may do so only at the next Open Season unless you involuntarily lose coverage under TRICARE or CHAMPV A. TRICARE and CHAMPV A W e do not cover services that: Y ou (or a covered family member) need because of a workplace-related illness or injury that the Of fice of W orkers' Compensation Programs (OWCP) or a similar Federal or State agency determines they must provide; or OWCP or a similar agency pays for through a third-party injury settlement or other similar proceeding that is based on a claim you filed under OWCP or similar laws. Once OWCP or similar agency pays its maximum benefits for your treatment, we will cover your care. W orkers' Compensation When you have this Plan and Medicaid, we pay first. Medicaid 99 2015 MHBP Section 9 Suspended FEHB coverage to enr oll in Medicaid or a similar State-sponsor ed pr ogram of medical assistance: If you are an annuitant or former spouse, you can suspend your FEHB coverage to enroll in one of these State programs, eliminating your FEHB premium. For information on suspending your FEHB enrollment, contact your retirement of fice. If you later want to re-enroll in the FEHB Program, generally you may do so only at the next Open Season unless you involuntarily lose coverage under the State program. W e do not cover services and supplies when a local, State, or Federal government agency directly or indirectly pays for them. When other Government agencies ar e r esponsible for your car e If you (the enrollee or any covered family member) receive (or are entitled to) a monetary recovery from any source as the result of an accidental injury or illness, you are required to reimburse us out of that recovery for any and all of our benefits paid to diagnose and treat that illness or injury . This is known as our reimbursement right. The Plan may also, at its option, pursue recovery on your behalf, which includes the right to file suit and make claims in your name. This is known as our subrogation right. The following are examples of situations to which our right to subrogate or to assert a right of reimbursement applies: When you are injured on premises owned by a third party; or When you are injured and benefits are available to you under any law or under any type of insurance, including but not limited to: - No-fault insurance and other insurance that pays without regard to fault, including personal injury protection benefits, regardless of any election made by you to treat those benefits as secondary to this Plan - third party liability coverage - uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage - W orkers' Compensation benefits - medical reimbursement or payment coverage Our reimbursement right applies even if the monetary recovery may not compensate you fully for all of the damages resulting from the injuries or illness. In other words, we are entitled to be reimbursed for those benefit payments even if you are not \"made whole\" for all of your damages by the compensation you receive. Our right of reimbursement is not subject to reduction for attorney' s fees under the \"common fund\" doctrine without our written consent. W e are entitled to be reimbursed for 100% of the benefits we paid on account of the injuries or illness unless we agree in writing to accept a lesser amount. W e enforce this right of reimbursement by asserting a first priority lien against any and all recoveries you receive by court order or out-of-court settlement, insurance or benefit program claims, or otherwise, without regard to how it is characterized, for example as \"pain and suf fering.\" Y ou must cooperate with our enforcement of our right of reimbursement by: telling us promptly whenever you have filed a claim for compensation resulting from an accidental injury or illness and responding to our questionnaires; pursuing recovery of our benefit payments from the third party or available insurance company; accepting our lien for the full amount of our benefit payments; signing our Reimbursement Agreement when requested to do so; When others ar e r esponsible for injuries 100 2015 MHBP Section 9 agreeing to assign any proceeds or rights to proceeds from third party claims or any insurance to us; keeping us advised of the claim's status; advising us of any recoveries you obtain, whether by insurance claim, settlement or court order , and; promptly reimbursing us out of any recovery received to the full extent of our right of reimbursement. Failure to cooperate with these obligations may result in the temporary suspension of your benefits and/or of fsetting of future benefits. For more information about this process, please call our Third Party Recovery Services unit at 202-683-9140. Some FEHB plans already cover some dental and vision services. When you are covered by more than one vision/dental plan, coverage provided under your FEHB plan remains as your primary coverage. FEDVIP coverage pays secondary to that coverage. When you enroll in a dental and/or vision plan on BENEFEDS.com, you will be asked to provide information on your FEHB plan so that your plans can coordinate benefits. Providing your FEHB information may reduce your out-of-pocket cost. When you have Federal Employees Dental and V ision Insurance Plan (FEDVIP) An approved clinical trial includes a phase I, phase II, phase III, or phase IV clinical trial that is conducted in relation to the prevention, detection, or treatment of cancer or other life-threatening disease or condition, and is either Federally-funded; conducted under an investigational new drug application reviewed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA); or is a drug trial that is exempt from the requirement of an investigational new drug application. If you are a participant in a clinical trial, this health plan will provide benefits for related care as follows, if it is not provided by the clinical trial: Routine care costs - costs for routine services such as doctor visits, lab tests, x-rays and scans, and hospitalizations related to treating the patient' s condition, whether the patient is in a clinical trial or is receiving standard therapy . These costs are covered by this Plan. Extra care costs - costs related to taking part in a clinical trial such as additional tests that a patient may need as part of the trial, but not as part of the patient' s routine care. This Plan does not cover these costs. Research costs - costs related to conducting the clinical trial such as research physician and nurse time, analysis of results, and clinical tests performed only for research purposes. These costs are generally covered by the clinical trials. This Plan does not cover these costs. Clinical trials When you have Medicar e Medicare is a health insurance program for: People 65 years of age or older Some people with disabilities under 65 years of age People with End-Stage Renal Disease (permanent kidney failure requiring dialysis or a transplant) Medicare has four parts: Part A (Hospital Insurance). Most people do not have to pay for Part A. If you or your spouse worked for at least 10 years in Medicare-covered employment, you should be able to qualify for premium-free Part A insurance. (If you were a Federal employee at any time both before and during January 1983, you will receive credit for your Federal employment before January 1983.) Otherwise, if you are age 65 or older , you may be able to buy it. Contact 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227), (TTY : 1-877-486-2048) for more information. What is Medicar e? 101 2015 MHBP Section 9 Part B (Medical Insurance). Most people pay monthly for Part B. Generally , Part B premiums are withheld from your monthly Social Security check or your retirement check. Part C (Medicare Advantage). Y ou can enroll in a Medicare Advantage plan to get your Medicare benefits. W e do not of fer a Medicare Advantage plan. Please review the information on coordinating benefits with Medicare Advantage plans. See Medicare Advantage (Part C) . Part D (Medicare prescription drug coverage). There is a monthly premium for Part D coverage. If you have limited savings and a low income, you may be eligible for Medicare' s Low-Income Benefits. For people with limited income and resources, extra help in paying for a Medicare prescription drug plan is available. For more information about this extra help, visit the Social Security Administration online at www .SocialSecurity .gov , or call them at 1-800-772-1213 (TTY : 1-800-325-0778). Before enrolling in Medicare Part D, please review the important disclosure notice from us about our prescription drug coverage and Medicare. This notice is on the first inside page of this brochure. The notice will give you guidance on enrolling in Medicare Part D. The decision to enroll in Medicare is yours. W e encourage you to apply for Medicare benefits 3 months before you turn age 65. It' s easy . Just call the Social Security Administration toll-free number 1-800-772-1213 (TTY : 1-800-325-0778) to set up an appointment to apply . If you do not apply for one or more Parts of Medicare, you can still be covered under the FEHB Program. If you can get premium-free Part A coverage, we advise you to enroll in it. Most Federal employees and annuitants are entitled to Medicare Part A at age 65 without cost . When you don' t have to pay premiums for Medicare Part A, it makes good sense to obtain the coverage. It can reduce your out-of-pocket expenses as well as costs to the FEHB, which can help keep FEHB premiums down. Everyone is char ged a premium for Medicare Part B coverage. The Social Security Administration can provide you with premium and benefit information. Review the information and decide if it makes sense for you to buy the Medicare Part B coverage. If you do not sign up for Medicare Part B when you are first eligible, you may be char ged a Medicare Part B late enrollment penalty of a 10% increase in premium for every 12 months you are not enrolled. If you didn' t take Part B at age 65 because you were covered under FEHB as an active employee (or you were covered under your spouse' s group health insurance plan and he/she was an active employee), you may sign up for Part B (generally without an increased premium) within 8 months from the time you or your spouse stop working or are no longer covered by the group plan. Y ou also can sign up at any time while you are covered by the group plan. If you are eligible for Medicare, you may have choices in how you get your health care. Medicare Advantage is the term used to describe the various health plan choices available to Medicare beneficiaries. The information in the next few pages shows how we coordinate benefits with Medicare, depending on the type of Medicare managed care plan you have. (Please r efer to page 106 for information about how we pr ovide benefits when you ar e age 65 or older and do not have Medicar e.) Should I enr oll in Medicar e? The Original Medicare Plan (Original Medicare) is available everywhere in the United States. It is the way everyone used to get Medicare benefits and is the way most people get their Medicare Part A and Part B benefits now . Y ou may go to any doctor , specialist, or hospital that accepts Medicare. The Original Medicare Plan pays its share and you pay your share. All physicians and other providers are required by law to file claims directly to Medicare for members with Medicare Part B, when Medicare is primary . This is true whether or not they accept Medicare. When you are enrolled in Original Medicare along with this Plan, you still need to follow the rules in this brochure for us to cover your care. The Original Medicar e Plan (Part A or Part B) 102 2015 MHBP Section 9 Claims pr ocess when you have the Original Medicar e Plan - Y ou will probably not need to file a claim form when you have both our Plan and the Original Medicare Plan.

Health car e pr ofessional 109 2015 MHBP Section 10 A formal program directed by a doctor to help care for a terminally ill person. The services may be provided through either a centrally-administered, medically-directed, and nurse-coordinated program that provides primarily home care services 24 hours a day , seven days a week by a hospice team that reduces or abates mental and physical distress and meets the special stresses of a terminal illness, dying and bereavement, or through confinement in a hospice care program. The hospice team must include a doctor and a nurse (R.N.) and also may include a social worker , cler gyman/counselor , volunteer , clinical psychologist, physical therapist, or occupational therapist. Hospice car e pr ogram An expense is incurred on the date a service or supply is rendered or received unless otherwise noted in this brochure. Incurr ed Inpatient care is rendered to a person who has been admitted to a hospital for bed occupancy for purposes of receiving inpatient hospital services. Generally , a patient is considered an inpatient if formally admitted as inpatient with the expectation that the patient will remain at least overnight and occupy a bed. The hospital bills for inpatient room and board char ges for each day (24 hour period) of the inpatient confinement as well as for hospital incidental services. Inpatient hospital benefits apply to services provided by the hospital during an inpatient admission. This Plan uses InterQual criteria to evaluate the appropriateness of inpatient care services. Inpatient car e The sudden and unexpected onset of a condition requiring immediate medical care. The severity of the condition, as revealed by the doctor ' s diagnosis, must be such as would normally require emer gency care. Medical emer gencies include heart attacks, cardiovascular accidents, loss of consciousness or respiration, convulsions and such other acute conditions as may be determined by the Plan to be medical emer gencies. Medical emergency Services, drugs, supplies, or equipment provided by a hospital or covered provider of health care services that the Plan determines: 1. are appropriate to diagnose or treat the patient' s condition, illness, or injury; 2. are consistent with standards of good medical practice in the United States; 3. are not primarily for the personal comfort or convenience of the patient, the family , or the provider; 4. are not a part of or associated with the scholastic education or vocational training of the patient; and 5. in the case of inpatient care, cannot be provided safely on an outpatient basis. The fact that a covered provider has prescribed, recommended, or approved a service, supply , drug or equipment does not, in itself, make it medically necessary . Medical necessity Conditions and diseases listed in the most recent edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) as psychoses, neurotic disorders or personality disorders; other nonpsychotic mental disorders listed in the ICD, to be determined by the Plan; or disorders listed in the ICD requiring treatment for abuse of or dependence upon substances such as alcohol, narcotics or hallucinogens. Mental health/substance abuse morbidities such as diabetes, coronary artery disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obstructive sleep apnea, pulmonary hypertension, weight-related degenerative joint disease, or lower extremity venous or lymphatic obstruction. Eligible members must be age 18 or older . Morbid obesity Observation care is a well-defined set of specific, clinically appropriate services, which include ongoing short term treatment, assessment, and reassessment, that are provided while a decision is being made regarding whether a patient will require further treatment as a hospital inpatient or whether the patient will be able to be dischar ged from the hospital. Observation services are commonly ordered for a patient who presents to the emer gency room department and who then requires a significant period of treatment or monitoring in order to make a decision regarding their inpatient admission or dischar ge. Some hospitals will bill for observation room status (hourly) and hospital incidental services. Observation car e 1 10 2015 MHBP Section 10 If you are in the hospital for more than a few hours, always ask your physician or the hospital staf f if your stay is consider inpatient or outpatient. Although you may stay overnight in a hospital room and receive meals and other hospital services, some hospital services-including \"observation care\"- are actually outpatient care. Since observation services are billed as outpatient care, outpatient facility benefit levels apply and your out-of-pocket expenses may be higher as a result. This Plan uses InterQual criteria to evaluate the appropriateness of observation care services. Any custom fitted external device used to support, align, prevent, or correct deformities, or to restore or improve function. Orthopedic appliance Our Plan allowance is the amount we use to determine our payment and your coinsurance for covered services. Fee-for -service plans determine their allowances in dif ferent ways. W e determine our allowance as follows: Network allowance : an amount that we negotiate with each provider or provider group who participates in our network. For these Network allowances, the Network provider has agreed to accept the negotiated reduction and you are not responsible for the discounted amount. In these instances, the benefit we pay plus any applicable deductible, copayment or coinsurance you are responsible for equals payment in full. Network allowance for mental health and substance abuse : a negotiated amount the mental health/substance abuse provider has agreed to accept as the negotiated reduction and you are not responsible for the discounted amount. In these instances, the benefit we pay plus any applicable deductible, copayment or coinsurance you are responsible for equals payment in full. Participating pr ovider allowance : If you receive services from a participating provider ( see Other Participating Providers , page 10), the Plan' s allowance will be the amount that the provider has negotiated and agreed to accept for the services and or supplies. Benefits will be paid at Non-Network benefit levels, subject to the applicable deductibles, coinsurance and copayments. Non-Network allowance : the amount the Plan will consider for services provided by Non- Network providers. Non-Network allowances are determined as follows: For all dialysis services and all urine drug testing services, the Non-Network allowance is the maximum Medicare allowance for such services. For other than dialysis services and urine drug testing services, the following applies: - If you receive care in an area that has a fully developed Network (one in which you have adequate access to a network provider), but you do not use a Network provider the Plan' s allowance will be reduced to a rate that the Plan would have paid had you used a Network provider . This Non-Network allowance is based upon a fee schedule that represents an average of the Network fee schedules for a particular service in a particular geographic area. In industry terms, this is called a \"blended\" fee schedule. Member out-of-pocket costs resulting from the application of the blended rate fee schedule will be limited to no more than an additional $5,000 (not including applicable coinsurance or copayments) beyond the out-of-pocket costs (not including applicable coinsurance or copayments) that would have been incurred if the blended rate had not been applied to the claim. This limitation on such additional out-of-pocket costs is applicable separately (per occurrence) to inpatient or outpatient hospital or ambulatory sur gical center services and separately (per occurrence) to sur gical fees. Other services to which the blended rate fee schedule applies are not subject to this limitation. W e encourage you to call the Plan before scheduling any outpatient hospital or ambulatory sur gical center services and/or sur gery so that we may assist you, if possible, in avoiding situations where the blended rate fee schedule will be applied. Plan allowance 1 1 1 2015 MHBP Section 10 Note: For those members who do not have adequate access to a network provider (in terms of distance from where you receive care, or to a network provider), those members receiving emer gency care, or where there is no \"blended\" fee schedule amount for the service or supply , the Plan' s Non-Network allowance will be based on the Plan' s out-of-network (OON) fee schedule (as described below), not the \"blended\" fee schedule. - If you receive care in an area that does not have a fully developed network and use a Non- Network provider , the Non-Network allowance is the lesser of: (1) the provider ' s billed char ge; or (2) the Plan' s OON fee schedule amount. The Plan' s OON fee schedule amount is equal to the 80th percentile amount for the char ges listed in the Prevailing Healthcare Char ges System or the Medicare Data Resources System administered by F AIR Health, Inc. if such a char ge exists for the service or supply . If no F AIR Health char ge exists, the OON fee schedule amount may be determined by using the iSight rate established by National Care Network. The OON fee schedule amounts vary by geographic area in which services are furnished. For certain services, exceptions may exist to the use of the OON fee schedule to determine the Plan' s Non-Network allowance, including, but not limited to, the use of Medicare fee schedule amounts. For claims governed by OBRA '90 and '93, the Plan allowance will be based on Medicare allowable amounts as is required by law . For claims where the Plan is the secondary payor to Medicare (Medicare COB situations), the Plan allowance is the Medicare allowable char ge. Network r etail pharmacy allowance : the amount negotiated by the Plan' s pharmacy benefit manager with the pharmacy or pharmacy group at which the drug is purchased. Non-Network r etail pharmacy allowance : the guaranteed discounted price for the drug negotiated by the Plan in its contract with its pharmacy benefit manager . Allowance for drugs pr ovided by Network or Participating pr oviders : the amount negotiated with each provider or provider group who participates in the respective network. Allowance for drugs pr ovided by Non-Network pr oviders : The \"blended\" fee schedule amount as described above, if the drug is provided by a facility provider in a fully-developed network area 80% of the A verage Wholesale Price (A WP) of the drug (or its equivalent if A WP data is no longer published), when - the drug is provided by a non-facility provider (e.g., a physician) - the drug is provided in a geographic area to which the blended fee schedule does not apply - there is no blended fee schedule amount available W e apply the National Correct Coding Initiative (NCCI) edits published by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) in reviewing billed services and making Plan benefit payments for them. For more information, see Dif ferences between our allowance and the bill in Section 4. Any claims that are not pre-service claims. In other words, post-service claims are those claims where treatment has been performed and the claims have been sent to us in order to apply for benefits. Post-service claims Those claims (1) that require precertification, prior approval, or a referral and (2) where failure to obtain precertification, prior approval, or a referral results in a reduction of benefits.
