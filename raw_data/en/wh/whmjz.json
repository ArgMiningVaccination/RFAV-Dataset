Enter with a mindset for conversation, not debate. I hold this view because EVERY source I've seen that casts doubt on the safety or efficacy of the Covid vaccine goes right back to right-wing politics. They're political sources, they're published on political websites, they're bloggers who also post right-wing political view. Any non-political source I've found is clearly in support of vaccines. I want my view changed because I do try to look at both sides of an issue. I do want all the information about a topic, especially in regards to mine and my family's health and safety. And if nothing else, I want to be able to respect the views of friends and family who feel otherwise. I would love for it to simply be a difference of opinion that's intelligently based in reality. Edit- i would add that any irrational, non-credible reason would be included with political, even though I only specified political. Whether it's fear, conspiracy, or anything along those lines Edit 2- ok I've spent way too much time on this. I'm getting a lot of the same uncited talking points I've seen over and over again, and I'm noticing more and more conspiracy theorists jumping in. I will try to continue to read replies, but I won't comment unless it's awfully compelling. "}
