Oslo: Norwegian Knowledge Centre for the Health Services, 2015. Norwegian Knowledge Centre for the Health Services summarizes and disseminates evidence concerning the effect of treatments, methods, and interventions in health services, in a ddition to monitoring health service quality. Our goal is to support good decision making in order to provide patients in Norway with the best po ssible care. The Knowledge Centre is organized under The Norwegian Directorat e of Health, but is scientifically and professionally independent. The Centre has no authority to develop health policy or responsibility to implement policies. Norwegian Knowledge Centre for the Health Services Oslo, January 2015 2 Key messages Key messages Infection with high-risk human papillo ma virus (HPV) types 16 and/or 18 is documented to be related to cervical, vulvar, vaginal, penile, anal and oropharyngeal cancer, while infection with low-risk HPV types 6 and/or 11 is documented to be related with genital warts. This economic evaluation examines the cost-effectiveness of vaccinating both 12-year-old boys and girls against HPV-infection compared to maintaining the current practice of vaccinating only 12-year-old girls. Two vaccines (both delivered in a 3-dose schedule) are available on the Norwegian market with documented effect against HPV-infection: the quadrivalent vaccine is directed at HP V 6, 11, 16 and 18 and the bivalent vaccine is directed at HPV 16 and 18. In this report, we estimated the cost- effectiveness of the quadrivalent vaccin e for the target population, as this is the vaccine currently offered in th e vaccine program for girls. The cost- effectiveness of the bivalent vaccine is discussed in a scenario analysis. The main finding of the eval uation is the following: From a societal perspective, vaccinating boys in addition to girls aged 12 with the quadrivalent vaccine is probably not cost-effective. The incremental cost-effectiveness was NOK 1,626,261 for a quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Although there is no official co st-effectiveness threshold value in Norway, such high ICERs are ge nerally associat ed with the intervention not being accepted for implementation in the Norwegian health sector.

The Norwegian Institute of Public Health is responsible for managing the publicly funded vaccination program against the human papillomavirus (HPV). Currently, this program covers the expenses of vacc inating only 12-year- old girls with the quadrivalent vaccine (directed at HPV 6, 11, 16 and 18), delivered in a 3-dose schedule. Gender-neutral vaccination has been recommended in a few countries, e.g. United States (1) and Australia (2). In the Eu ropean Union, only Austria (3) has recommended it. The UK government decided in 2014 to reconsider whether HPV vaccination should be offered to men wh o have sex with men and/or adolescent males (4). In this economic evaluation, we evaluate the cost-effectiveness of vaccinating 12-year-old boys against HPV-infection in addition to the current practice of vaccinating 12-year-old-girls, compared to maintaining the current practice. Objective To evaluate the epidemiological impact, costs, health benefits and cost-effectiveness of administering the quadrivalent HPV-vacci ne to 12-year-old-boys in addition to the current practice of vaccinating 12-yea r-old-girls, compared to maintaining the current practice. We evaluate in addition how alternative scenarios would influence results and conclusions. Method We used an already published American economic model consisting of a deterministic, dynamic popu lation-based model that estimated the proportion of 4 Executive summary people in every contemporary and future cohort having experienced infection with HPV 6/11, 16 and/or 18, from 2016-2115. The model was adapted to the Norwegian setting with respect to incidence rates of HPV-related outcomes, costs and health related quality-of-l ife (HRQoL). In addition, the model was modified in order to incorporate the findings on clinical endpoints reported in our systematic re views. Finally, the model was made probabilistic. The focus in our base case analysis was on evaluating the consequences of HPV- vaccination of boys (using the quadrivalent vaccine in a 3-dose schedule) may have for 184 birth cohorts during the first 100 years: The 91 cohorts aged 8-99 at the moment of starting the vaccination of boys and the coming 93 cohorts of 8-year-old boys and girls. We assumed that 82% of all boys and girls aged 12 would get on average 2.54 and 2.78 doses of the HPV-vaccine, respecti vely. Furthermore, we assumed that the vaccine would only have effect on genital warts, cervical, vulvar, vaginal and anal precancerous lesions and cancer as documented in our own systematic reviews (vaginal and anal outcomes were included only in sensitivity an alyses). Finally, the price of the vaccine was set equal to the maximum pharmacy retail price (PRP) of the quadrivalent vaccine in De cember 2014, NOK 1,113.40/dose. The economic evaluation was performed fr om two different costs perspectives: a health-care perspective focusing on cost s to the National health system; and a societal perspective in whic h we excluded the value-added tax (VAT) from prices and included the deadweight loss of taxation, the costs to patients for time used under treatment and the work-related prod uctivity costs due to disease. For each perspective, an Incremental Cost Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) in terms of NOK per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained was calculated. To determine whether vaccinating boys aged 12 was cost-effective, the resulting ICER was compared to a range of potential willingness-to-pay (WTP) values between NOK 250 000 - 2 000 000/ QALY gained. IC ERs lower than the chosen WTP value typically supports the hypothesis that vaccina ting boys is cost-effective and therefore yields good value for money, while ICERs above the chosen WTP value suggest the opposite. In addition, we assessed the uncertainty around the results and estimated the Expected Value of Perf ect Information (EVPI). We ascertained the impact on the base case results by changing the value of potentially important inputs and modelling assumptions. We did this by conducting the following sensitivity analyses (from a health care perspective): 5 Executive summary 1. Lower vaccine purchase prices per dose. 2. The exclusion of the effect of the vaccine on genital warts in order to examine the cost-effectiveness of using a bivalent vaccine. 3. Increasing the coverage among girls instead of vaccinating boys. 4. The exclusion of the HRQoL-impact of vaccination. 5. The inclusion of the vaccine effect on anal cancer (in both genders) and vaginal cancer and vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 and 3 (VaIN 2+). 6. The exclusion of the effect of the vaccine in reducing the number of conization-related preterm births. 7. A 2-doses schedule providing the full va ccination effect repo rted in published studies. 8. The reduction in the incidence of several relevant outcomes under different vaccine coverage assumptions. In addition, we conducted a series of one-way sensitivity analyses where we examined how the base case results changed when increasing or reducing certain groups of variables (epidemiologic, effect , costs, HRQoL) by 25%. We present the results in the form of a Tornado diagram. Results From a health-care perspective, the base ca se results showed that including boys in the current vaccination program would lead to a discounted, incremental cost of NOK 1.851 billion (1 billion = 1 thousand million) and a discounted, incremental health gain of 1,034.59 QALYs over the 10 0 years horizon of the model (2016-2115). This resulted in an ICER of NOK 1,789, 463/QALY. The scatter-plot of the ICER showed that both the incremental costs and the health gain were positive for all iterations. The ICER of vaccinating boys is lower from a societal perspective than from a public health perspective. The incremental costs were approximately 9% lower, NOK 1.677 billion vs. NOK 1.851 billion in the publ ic health-care perspective, while the incremental effect was the same, leading to an ICER of NOK 1,626,261 /QALY. The results of the scenario analyses were the following: 1. Using prices of NOK 250, 500 and 750/dose resulted in lower incremental costs and therefore lower ICERs of NOK 351,975/QALY, NOK 765,909/QALY and NOK 1,186,606/QA LY, respectively. 2. Excluding the vaccine effect on genita l warts resulted in both somewhat higher incremental costs and a considerably lower incremental health effect than in the base case. The resulting ICER was NOK 3,754,854/QALY. 6 Executive summary Assuming these results apply to the biva lent vaccine, and that the price of the quadrivalent vaccine is equal to the public price of NOK 1,113.40/dose, we estimated that the price of the bivalent vaccine had to be approximately 550 NOK/dose or lower in order to be as cost-effective as the quadrivalent vaccine. 3. Increasing the first dose coverage among girls aged 12 from 82% to 92% (for at least one dose) instead of vaccinating boys of same age resulted in a 42% lower incremental effect and an 89% lower incremental costs than vaccinating boys. The ICER was NOK 336,755/QALY, considerably below the ICER of the vaccination program for boys. 4. Ignoring all HRQoL-gains (reduction of morbidity) and focusing exclusively on lifetime gains (reduction in mortalit y) in terms of life-years gained (LYG) resulted in a 71% decrease in the nominal incremental effect of the program, compared to the base case (where reductions in both morbidity and mortality are assessed). This is partly due to the large HRQoL-gain associated with preventing genital warts, an importan t outcome for males in our model. The lower incremental effect leads to a considerably higher ICER, NOK 6,188,344 /LYG. 5. When incorporating the potential effe ct of the vaccine in reducing the number of cases of VaIN 2+ and vagina l and anal cancer, the ICER decreased to NOK 1,538,578/QALY. 6. When excluding the vaccine effect in reducing the number of conization- related preterm births, the ICER increased to NOK 1,848,515/QALY. 7. Assuming all children get two va ccination doses led to an ICER of NOK 1,389,853 million/QALY, approximately 22% lower than in the base case. 8. Depending on the outcome, including bo ys in the vaccination program led to incidence reductions after 100 years that were 1-9 percentage points higher than increasing coverage among girls and 3-13 percentage points higher than vaccinating only girls at the current coverage rate. The greatest incidence reduction accomplished by vaccinating boys was registered for genital warts among males. Finally, our one-way sensitivity analyses sh owed that changes in the incidence of HPV-related outcomes and the HRQoL-losses associated with these outcomes had a considerable impact on the cost-effectivene ss results, although less than changes in the vaccine effect estimates. Changes in the HPV-acquisition rates and treatment costs had very limited impact on the results. Conclusion From both perspectives and given the current public price of NOK 1,113.4/dose of the quadrivalent vaccine, vaccinating boys in addition to girls aged 12 years is 7 Executive summary probably not cost-effective. The incremental ICER was NOK 1,789,463/QALY from a health perspective and NOK 1,626,26 1/QALY from a soci etal perspective. Although there is no official cost-effectiv eness threshold value in Norway, such high ICERs are generally associated with th e intervention not being accepted for implementation in the Norwegian health sector. The price scenario analysis shows that a lower price per vaccine dose has a major, positive effect on the cost-effectiveness of the program. Increasing coverage among girls aged 12 from 82% to 92% seems to be more cost- effective than vaccinating boys and girls at a coverage rate of 82%. The price of the bivalent vaccine should not be higher than approximately NOK 550/dose for it to be deemed as cost-effective Fagfeller: Economics Research Unit, University Aas, Avdeling for helseledelse og anal, penis- og munnsvelgkreft.

In addition, to evaluate how alternative scenarios would influence results and conclusions. 20 Background Background Human papillomavirus (HPV) is considered the most common sexually transmitted virus worldwide (5) and more than 100 type s of HPV have been identified (6, 7). Several cancers are believed to be primaril y HPV-related, among others 100% of all cervical cancers, 90% of all anal cancers (in both genders) and 40% of all vulvar and vaginal cancers (8). In additi on, close to 100% of all anogenital warts are associated with low-risk HPV types (9). The annual age-adjusted incidence rates per 100 000 person-years of these HPV- related outcomes vary widely: 540 for geni tal warts (average for ages 17-49 and for both genders, own calculations), 10 for cervical cancer, 1.7 for vulvar cancer, 1 for female anal cancer and 0.5 for male anal cancer (10). Efficient prophylactic vaccines could have an important public health impact. As cancer takes a long time to develop, it wo uld be difficult to conduct clinical trials ascertaining the efficacy of HPV vaccination on cervical cancer and other cancer types related to HPV. Furthermore, as screening for cervical ca ncer is available, conducting such trials would be unethica l. For these reasons, the WHO and the US Food and Drug Administration recommended that phase III trials examining vaccination efficacy can use high-grade ce rvical intraepithelial neoplasia grades 2 and 3 (CIN 2+) as endpoints (11). The Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI) is responsible for managing the vaccination program against HPV. Current ly, this program covers the direct expenses of vaccinating 12-year-old girls with the quadrivalent vaccine through the public health-care system. Although some countries, e.g. United St ates, Austria, and Australia, recommend gender-neutral vaccination, results from models of the cost-e ffectiveness of such policies vary widely according to model assumptions. Incorporating herd immunity and the burden of disease in men, male vaccination may be co st-effective depending upon coverage, vaccine price and other factors (12-16). The target population of a potential ma le vaccination program in Norway would consist of each cohort of boys aged 12 born in 2004 or later, each consisting of approximately 31 000 individuals (17). 21 Background Introduction to Economic Evaluations of Health-care Programmes The basic task of any economic evaluation is to identify, measure, value and compare costs and consequences of the alternatives being considered in an incremental analysis which means that the di fference in cost is compared with the differences in consequences (18). Hence, results of economic evaluations can be expressed as an incremental cost-effective ness ratio (ICER), which is defined by the following equation: EC Effect EffectCost CostICER comparator on interventicomparator on interventi Because the health-care sector, as the societ y in general, is restricted by scarce resources and budget constraints, econom ic evaluations are tools for decision makers facing questions of how to priori tize and maximize benefits from scarce resources. For an economic evaluation to be meaningful in a decision making process, the ICER must be ju dged with regards to a ceiling ratio that reflects the decision maker's maximum willingness-to -pay (WTP) for a health gain. Such a ceiling ratio has not yet been established in Norway. The decision rule for an economic evaluation can therefore be expressed as: EC where equals WTP, and means that if the IC ER of an intervention is below the ceiling ratio, introducing the intervention represents good value for money. Because ICERs have poor statistical properties, they are often rearranged to express either net monetary benefit (NMB) or net health benefit (NHB), yielding the following decision rules related to NMB or NHB. 0 : C E NMB 0 : CE NHB In other words, the intervention can be considered cost-effect ive if it yields a positive NHB or NMB. Economic evaluations are often based on de cision models (such as decision trees and Markov models) that calculate results based on various inpu t parameters in the model. Because there are always uncertainties related to the values of these parameters, sensit ivity analysis is an important feature of any economic evaluation using a decision model framework. In sh ort, sensitivity analysis illustrates how much the results vary as model parameters are changed. Sensitivity analyses can be performed in various ways, with one-wa y or two-way sensitivity analysis being common approaches. This represents changing, respectively, one or two model- 22 Background parameters at a time while all other model-parameters are held constant, in order to see how much impact the variation in these parameters has on the results. One-way sensitivity analyses are often presented as tornado-diagrams, which identify and illustrate the model-parameters that ha ve the highest impact on the results. Another important kind of sensitivity an alysis is referred to as probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA). The advantage of PSA is that it takes the uncertainties of all model-parameters into account simultaneously. The basic approach in PSA is to assign appropriate probability distribution s to the model-parameters, i.e. replacing of the \"fixed\" values of the parameters with values generated by random draws from the distributions. Doing this repeatedly, wi th a large number of iterations, enables one to estimate probabilities of alternativ es that would be cost-effective subject to different ceiling values of WTP. The calc ulation is based on the alternative that renders the highest values of NMB or NHB. PSA is often presented as scatter plots, which show point estimates of the ICER fo r all iterations in the cost-effectiveness plane, and also by cost-effectiveness acce ptability curves (CEACs), that show the probability of the alternatives being cost -effective subject to changing values of WTP. Another result from PSA is the expected value of perfect information (EVPI). This number indicates the upper bound on the re turns to further research about the costs and effect of a health program (i.e. th e returns of eliminating 100% of the uncertainties in the results of the analysis). It can also be interpreted as the expected cost of uncertainty, and is determined join tly by the probability that a decision based on existing information will be wrong (i.e . that another alternative would have had higher net-benefit once our current uncertainties are resolved) and the consequences of a wrong decision (19). If EVPI for a given population seems large, it might be of interest to find out for which parameters it would be most useful to get new and improved data. Expected value of perfect information for parameters is a more time-consuming operation, but it can help determine for which single parameters or groups of parameters it is most cost-effective to conduct new research. In short, making a model probabilistic me ans that it is possible to estimate the uncertainty in the decision of implementing alternative interventions, which allows estimating the value of collecting additional information from new research. 23 Background Priority setting criteria According to Norwegian policy documents (20), a treatment should be prioritized only if the following criteria are met: 1. The disease is severe: A disease is considered severe to the degree that it causes pain and discomfort, loss of physical, psyc hological and social function and if it limits the individual in his or her daily activities. Severity is also evaluated according to the increase in the risk of death, disability and discomfort, if treatment is postponed. 2. The treatment is effective: the patient should be expected to benefit from treatment in terms of longevity or improv ed quality of life of certain duration. The treatment effectiveness should also be well documented. 3. The treatment is cost-effective: the additional costs of the treatment should be reasonable compared to the additional benefits. The policy documents mentioned above give no guidance as to what constitutes a \"reasonable\" relationship between costs and effectiveness. There exists no academic consensus regarding this threshold value, nor has it been subject to a political process in Norway. 24 Methods Methods Choice of Model The cost-effectiveness of HPV- vaccination has been examined in a series of health- economic models for a large number of different patient groups, see for example Seto and colleagues (21). Due to the avai lability of already developed models, we decided to adapt one of them to the Norwegian setting. In order to choose the most appropri ate model, we required that it: was not developed or financed by the pharmaceutical industry or other for- profit organizations (in order to avoid potential conflicts of interests), was accessible for examination, modification and publication, incorporated the effect of the vaccine on every outcome for which a link to HPV is well documented, incorporated herd immunity, and allowed for probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) and value-of-information (VoI) analysis The chosen model was developed at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) by Harrell W. Chesson and colleague s (13). Harrel W. Chesson collaborated with us during the adaptation of the model, although the responsibility for the final choices in this analysis and the re sults are the authors' alone. This model has been previously adapted to a Norwegian setting in order to assess the cost-effectiveness of administering a catch-up vaccine to females aged 26 or younger who were not offered the vaccine at age 12 (22). General The analysis consists of a cost-utility an alysis (CUA) in which relevant costs were expressed in Norwegian kroner (NOK) and effects were expressed in QALYs. The analysis was conducted both from a public health-care and a societal cost 25 Methods perspective. Both costs and effects were discounted as currently recommended by the Norwegian Ministry of Finance (23), i.e. a discount rate of 4% during the first 40 years of the program, 3% from year 41 to 75 and finally, 2% beyond year 75 of the program. The model we use calculates the number of avoided HPV-related outcomes due to HPV vaccination. Each outcom e is assumed to be associat ed with a loss of quality- adjusted life years (QALY) and a treatment cost. Therefore the incremental effect of the vaccination program would be represented by the net amount of avoided lost QALYs, while the incremental cost would consist of the difference in vaccination costs and avoided treatment costs. The sc reening program and its associated costs are assumed to remain unchanged, see Discussion for details. The results were expressed as ICERs, and suggestions about cost-effectiveness were based on a range of potential willingness -to-pay values. Uncertainties in model- parameters were handled by making the decision model probabilistic and by performing one-way sensitiv ity and scenario analyses (i. e. analyses in which we tested alternative assumptions on some given parameters). Model Structure The original model is described in detail elsewhere (13, 24). Here we will highlight its main elements and, where relevant, the main differences between the original model and its Norwegian adapta tion used in this report. A discrete-time approach is used in the infection model, in which the impact of vaccination was modeled as a sequence of 1-year transitions among four mutually exclusive states. Differences in sexual activity level (that is, rate of sex partner change) were incorporated in the model by assuming age-specif ic probabilities of acquiring HPV 6/11, 16 and/or 18. The transition from HPV acquisition to HPV-related health outcomes is not explicitly modeled. Instead, the impact of vaccination on health outcomes was calculated under the assumption that the percentage reduction in health outcomes attributable to a specific HPV-type, in a given year and for a given age cohort, was proportional to the percentage reduction in the cumulative acquisition rate of that HPV-type due to vaccination. Although it is a simpler model compared to other existing models (15, 16, 25), in the sense that there was no need to model the possible progression from HPV infection to disease, the mixing of se x partners, and so forth, Chesson and colleagues reported results that were consistent with results of published studies based on more complex 26 Methods models. This was particularly the case when key assumptions (e.g., vaccine duration, efficacy, and cost) were similar (24). The cumulative acquisition rate at a given age is equivalent to the share of the cohort that has experienced infection (with the rele vant HPV-type) for the first time at the age of interest or before. The focus is th erefore on the first infection and not on reinfections. The vaccine reduces the cumula tive acquisition rate in tw o different ways: First, it protects the vaccinated individual against infection when exposed to the HPV-virus (the direct effect, which only vaccinate d males and females benefit from); and second, it reduces the overa ll probability of exposure to HPV, independently of vaccination status (the indirect effect or herd immunity, which all females and males benefit from). See Appendix 3. Vaccine e ffect for more details on how the vaccine effect was incorporated in our analysis. Cervical cancer screening was not explicitly modeled. Instead, we assumed that current cervical cancer screening in Norway was reflected in the observed rates of cervical intraepithelial neopla sia (CIN) and cervical cancer applied in the model. In other words, we assume that the current screening activities remain unchanged within the time frame of the model. The model consists of six similar infection submodels, three for each gender: One for HPV 16, another for HPV 18 and the last on e for HPV 6/11. For each submodel, each age cohort was divided into four groups, based on the individual's vaccination and HPV-exposure status, see Figure 1. Figure 1. Vaccination and infection submod el used for each HPV-type and gender. Each submodel reports the distribution of each cohort aged 8-99 among these four groups during the 100 year-period after implementation of the HPV-vaccination program for boys and girls aged 12. This means that: 27 Methods - Our analysis focuses on the consequences that such a program may have for 184 specific cohorts of boys and girls, namely the 91 cohorts aged 8-99 at the start of the vaccination program and th e future 93 cohorts of 8-year-olds. - The statuses of cohorts aged 0-7 and 100 and older were ignored, as we assumed that the effect of the vaccine on the incidence rates of HPV-related diseases in these age groups would be negligible. - Our analysis also ignores those transition s taking place before and after the 100 year-period after implementati on of the HPV-vaccination. In every submodel, each cohort of girls an d each cohort of boys enters the model in the susceptible group (X), at age 8. These girls/boys are neither vaccinated nor infected with the relevant HPV-type. The infected group (Y) consists of those not vaccinated who have been infected in the years after age 8. Those infected with a specific HPV-type never return to the susc eptible group for that type and receive no benefit if vaccinated. Furthermore, we assumed no children might experience infection with any HPV in age 8-12 (see the epidemiology section for details), although the model allows for alternative assumptions for these age groups (which we have not examined). Those in the susceptible group (X) at the time of the vaccination (age 12) move to the \"vaccinated, not infected\" group (V), or, po ssibly to the \"vaccinated, infected\" group (Z), as vaccine does not prevent 100% of all future infections with HPV 6/11, 16 and/or 18. In any given year after vaccinatio n, those in the \"vaccinated, not infected\" group (V) can also move to the \"v accinated, infected\" group (Z). Those in the infected group (Y) at the time of vaccination move to the \"vaccinated after HPV infection\" group (Z), and we assu med that those in this group remain here for life and do not receive any vaccine benefits in terms of protection against HPV 6/11, 16 or 18. The rest of the population (i.e. cohorts ag ed 9 or older), were distributed among the four states based on earlier transiti ons (not reported in our analysis). Furthermore: - Individuals may die in any of the four cl asses. The same age- and sex-specific all-cause death rates (background mortal ity) from Statistics Norway were applied to all classes, such that th e number of people in each cohort decreased from year to year due to de ath, but death did not influence the age and year-specific percentage of the population in each class. Differences in cervical, vulvar, vaginal and anal cancer mortality (the latter two only in sensitivity analyses) betwee n vaccination strategies are incorporated in the model through the QALY-losses accumula ted by each treatment group (more details in the section about the health related quality-of-life). Background mortality was not adjusted for HPV-related mortality. 28 Methods - g,a,t is the annual probability of rece iving HPV vaccination, i.e. the corresponding coverage rate, for gender \"g\" (1 for female, 2 for male) at age \"a\" in year t (where 1 t 100). In our case, g,a,t is equal to 82% at age 12 for every vaccinated cohort of boys and girls, and zero otherwise. - Eg is vaccine efficacy against HPV 6/11, 16 or 18 acquisition for gender \"g\". It is defined as the relative risk reduction (RRR) of persistent infection after 12 months for gender g (see the section about the efficacy of the vaccine for details). - g,a,t is the annual probability of acquiring HPV 6/11, 16 or 18 for gender g at age a in year t. It is calculated by adjust ing the probability of HPV acquisition in the absence of vaccination (P), for changes in HPV prevalence in the population due to HPV vaccination (s ee the epidemiology section for more details about P). The adjustment is ca lculated based on the changes in the cumulative acquisition rate (from age 8) for the relevant HPV type in the population, thus incorporating herd immunity in the model. See Chesson (13), appendix 1, pages 4, 5 and 6 for further details. In both the original and the Norwegian model sexual behavior is incorporated through the adjusted probability of HPV ac quisition in the absence of vaccination, by assuming an assortative sexual mixing across age groups such that 90% of individuals choose sexual part ners within 5 years of their own age. The other 10% choose sexual partners without regard to the age difference. The main outcome in the base case of th e Norwegian model is the reduction of the following HPV 6/11, 16 and/or 18 rela ted outcomes among men and/or women: - Cancer (cervical and vulvar). - Cervical intraepithelial neoplasias, grades 2 and 3 (CIN 2 and 3) - Vulvar intraepithelial neoplasias, grades 2 and 3 (VIN 2 and 3) - Genital warts - Conization related preterm births (living babies born before week 33) due to previous CIN 2+ treatment of the mother - Serious cases of adverse events due to vaccination For more details about the calculation of the number of avoided outcomes, see Appendix 3. Va ccine effect. The Norwegian model does not include vaginal, anal, penile or oropharyngeal cancer in its base case, all of which were included in the original mode l (13). Nevertheless, we conduct a scenario analysis in which th e effect of vaccination on anal cancer (both genders) and vaginal cancer and pr ecancerous lesions, are included. These 29 Methods analyses are based on the effect estimates from our review (26) on precancerous anal lesions (VIN/VaIN and AIN 2+). Finally, our model was made probabilistic, in the sense that most key input variables were assigned a probability distribution ba sed on the available da ta. This allowed us to better assess the uncertainty around th e results and to estimate the expected value of perfect in formation (EVPI). Model Parameters In order to consider the consequences of vaccinating both boys and girls aged 12, the analysis has to include different types of parameters to capture epidemiologic information, estimates of the effect of the vaccine on outcomes of interest, costs and health related qualit y-of-life (HRQoL). Epidemiology 1. HPV 6/11, 16 and 18 annual first-time acquisition probabilities for males and females in the absence of vaccination (P). We only needed to estimate the annual probability of first-time infection in the absence of vaccination, i.e. P (see the section about model structure for details). To our knowledge, no such data are available for Norway, so we estimated them based on yet unpublished prevalence data from the Norwegian Institute of Public Health and the ac quisition rates used by Chesson and colleagues for the United States. For more details, see Appendix 2. Epidemiological data. As mentioned above, we assumed no children aged 12 or younger would experience HPV-infection, as the median age of sexual debut in Norway has been estimated to be 17.1 for females and 17.9 for males (27). Furthermore, we assumed that the resulting probabil ities would apply to both males and females, as we did not find any evidence supporting the hypothesis of acquisition differences betw een genders. We assumed as well that P for the different HPV-types would not change ov er time, as we did not expect these to be influenced by the implementati on of any HPV vaccination program. Finally, our model applies only to a he terosexual population, so that the probabilities we estimated may not be representative for women (men) exclusively having sex with other women (men). 30 Methods Figure 2. Estimated annual acquisition probabilities for HPV 6/11, 16 and 18 (both genders) All three curves show rapid growth in the acquisition probabilities from young ages to a peak at approximately 20-22 years old, and then a rapid decline phase ending in the early thirties, followed by a phase of slow decline. Figure 3 shows the cumulative HPV 6/11, 16 and 18 acquisition rates associated with our acquisition probability estimates. The cumulative acquisition rate at age \"x\" is the prob ability of having experienced infection at age \"x\" or before. At age 99, the cumulative acquisition rate may be interpreted as the lifetime probability of having experienced infection with the relevant HPV-type. Our data suggests for example that the lifetime probability of infection with HPV 6/11, 16 and 18 in Norway (and for both genders) is 35%, 26% and 70%, respectively. Figure 3. Estimated HPV 6/11, 16 and 18 cumulative acquisitio n rate in Norway as a function of age. 31 Methods 2. Cervical and vulvar intraepithel ial neoplasia (CIN/VIN) 2 and 3 The Cancer Registry of Norway provided data on the number of new CIN and VIN 2 and 3 cases (confirmed through biopsy) that occurred every year from 2002 to 2012 and by age group (for VIN the data was for the 2008-2012 period). There was no differentiated data according to VIN type, but since most of cases reported to the Cancer Registry of Norway are of high-grade, i.e. 2 or 3 (personal communication) , we assumed that all VIN were 2+. We combined these data with population data from Statistics Norway (17) to calculate average annual incidence rates per female for each age group. We then extrapolated the average for 2002/2008-2012 over the horizon of the model (100 years, beginning in 2016). To calculate an annual incidence rate, data about the number of new cases of an outcome of interest occurring duri ng a given time period and the total person-time observed in th at period, are required. Over a fixed period, the latter is the average size of the population over the observed period. Therefore, we used the total number of females in each age group for the observed period for which we had case information. The results are the following: Table 1. Estimated annual incidence rate of CIN/VIN 2 and 3 in Norway, per person-year. Age group CIN 2* CIN 3* 2008-2012 *** Average 2008-2012, used only in sensitivity analyses Incidence rates for CIN 3 seem to be consistently higher than for CIN 2 (except for age group 15-19, for which they were equal). This might be due to the medical practice in Norway, focused on carrying out biopsies only when 32 Methods cytology indicates HSIL (High-grade Squamous Intraepithelial Cells of Undetermined Significance) or LSIL (Low-grade Squamous Intraepithelial lesions). In these cases, finding CIN 3 is more probable than finding CIN 2, as the latter may have resolved/spont aneously disappeared without further complications. 3. Cancer The Cancer Registry of Norway provided data on annual incidence rates for cervical, vulvar, vaginal and anal cancer for the period 2002-2012, for specified age groups and gender. Because the data showed that incidence rates for most cancer forms were relative ly stable over this period, we used average rates for 2002-2012 to extrapolate the annual incidence rates for the horizon of the model. Table 2. Annual cancer incidence rates pe r 100 000 person-years in Norway 0 0 15-19 0 13.28 23.58 4.25 7.47 5.31 * Used only in sensitivity analyses 4. Genital warts In our search for estimates for the incidence rates of genital warts in Norway, we examined a recent systematic review with data from several countries (28). In this review, the auth ors identified Norwegian data in one study (29), which reported cumulative incidence rates of self-reported, 33 Methods clinically diagnosed genital warts among a sample of females in Norway (see Appendix 2. Epidemiological data for details). Lack ing separate information for Norwegian men, we assumed that the estimated rates for women also applied to men. Figure 4. Estimated annual incidence rates of genital warts in Norway (per person-year), per age group and for both genders. 5. Conization-related preterm births Conization (also known as cone biopsy) is a form of cervical biopsy, as well as a method of treating CIN 2 and 3. Women who have undergone conization before pregnancy have a greater risk of experiencing preterm deliveries (30-32). Since infection with HPV 16 and 18 has been reported to cause CIN 2+ (33), we included in our analysis the potential reduction in preterm deliveries due to the vaccine. We ch ose to limit our analysis to preterm deliveries of living babies before week 33 of gestation, as these children seem to have the greatest risk of experiencing serious lifetime-disabilities (communication with Ingvil d Vistad). Late abortions (no more than 24 weeks of gestation) were also excluded from our analysis, this time due to ethical considerations. Norwegian data from Albrechtsen (34) shows that, for the period 1967-2003, 769 preterm deliveries before week 33 took place among women having undergone conization prior to pregnancy. This represents 0.0344% of all deliveries in that period. Since preterm deliveries may be caused by factors other than the conization status of the mother, we corrected for this when calculating the share of preterm births that may be avoided due to the HPV-vaccine (see Appendix 2. 34 Methods Epidemiological data). Our calculatio ns showed that HPV-infection-related critical preterm deliveries may account for 0.0248% of all births in a given year. Although the effect of a reduction in the cumulative acquisition rate of HPV 16 and 18 on the annual number of conizations is likely to be relatively limited, every critical preterm delivery is associated with a potential for excess mortality, reduction in health-related quality of life, as well as need for health care throughout life. See the Quality-adjusted life years and Costs sections for more detail s. The impact on the results of excluding these preterm births was examined in a sensitivity analysis. 6. Adverse effects of the vaccine The Norwegian Medicines Agency periodically reports the number of registered adverse events (AEs) attributed to the HPV-vaccine. Their report indicates that, as of August 2014 (35), 358 950 vaccine doses had been administered to girls born between 1 997 and 2001. A total of 508 AEs were registered, of which 29 were considered serious, meaning that the patient experienced a reaction that required either admission to hospital or prolonged stay at the hospital. That represents approximately 8 serious AEs per 100 000 doses. Table 3. Vaccination and related serious adverse events (AEs) in Norway, 2009-2014 Antall doser satt Dose Girls born 1997 Girls born 1998 Girls born 1999 Girls born 2000 Girls born 2001 Source First dose 22 174 24 402 25 268 25 737 25 350 Norwegian Medicines Agency (35) Second dose 21 851 24 116 24 853 25 129 25 129 Third dose 21 380 23 633 23 644 23 142 23 142 Total per cohort 65 405 72 151 73 765 74 008 73 621 Total since vaccination program 358 950 Total # AEs 508 Serious AEs 29 Number of serious AEs (per 100 000 doses) 8 Own calculations As the non-serious AEs lasted for a sh ort period of time and probably had limited consequences for the patient, we did not include them in our model. 35 Methods We only incorporated the rate of se rious AEs cases per 100 000 doses to calculate the annual incidence rate per dose. Furthermore, we did not have AEs data for boys: The data presented above apply only to girls, and the serious AEs registered in the effect studies for boys were considered by the authors to be unrelated to the study vaccination(26). Therefore, we assumed that the annual incidence rate per dose among boys was the same as among girls. 7. Cohort size In order to calculate the possible number of negative outcomes a HPV vaccine program may prevent, the model requires data not only on the incidence rates but also on the number of people in each cohort. We obtained population data from Statisti cs Norway showing that by 1 st of January 2014 there were 60 940 (29 825 girls and 31 115 boys) eight-year-old children (17), and assumed that the size of future cohorts of eight-year-olds would remain unchanged. 8. Birth rates As explained above, the vaccine protects against HPV-infection, which may develop into CIN 2+ and then require coni zation later during a patient's life. To calculate the number of avoided conization-related events, we retrieved data from Statistics Norway for 2013 (36) on the number of live births, according to the mother's age, and the number of females in each age group (see Appendix 2. Epidemiological data for details). 9. Death rates for the general population Finally, the number of people in each co hort may decrease as the cohort ages, due to all-cause mortality. To account for this in our model, we incorporated gender specific death rates (per 100 000) from Statistics Norway for 2013 (see Appendix 2. Epidemiologi cal data for more details). Efficacy of the HPV vaccine among boys and girls We performed a systematic review to obtain data on the effect of the vaccine among boys in terms of protection against HPV 6/11, 16 and 18 infection, penile and anal precancerous lesions, cancer or canc er mortality and genital warts (26). We only found reliable effect data for HPV-infection and geni tal warts, which we used together with the effect estimates fo r persistent infectio n, CIN 2+, VIN/VaIN 36 Methods 2+ and genital warts among females that we used in our econom ic evaluation of catch-up HPV vaccination of young women (22). This means that our base case analysis does not include the effects of the vaccine on other outcomes linked to HPV-infection, such as vaginal, anal, penile and oropharyngeal cancer and juvenile onse t recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (JoRRP). Nevertheless, we present below th e effect estimates on anal and vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia, grade 2 and 3 (AIN and VaIN 2+) as these were used in a scenario analysis (see Scenario Analyses ). In order to reflect the effect of the vaccine on the general population in a more realistic manner, we used intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis and estimates for all lesions irrespective of HPV type. Finally, we extrapolated the effect on precancerous vulvar lesions to vulvar cancer and the effect on precancerous cervical lesions on cervical cancer and conization- related preterm births. Given the relatively protracted du ration of carcinogenesis following HPV infection (median time from HPV infection to carcinoma in situ has been estimated to be 7-12 years) (37), an d the relatively low frequency of cervical cancer due to screening and early treatment, clinical studies using cervical cancer as an endpoint could require a prolonged dura tion of follow-up to identify sufficient cases to establish efficacy (26). Furthermor e, and according to the FDA, if efficacy trials using cervical cancer as the endpoint cannot be conducted, prevention of CIN 2+ or worse will most closely approximate the preventive efficacy of HPV vaccines for cervical cancer (38). This approach was also followed for VIN 2+ in our base case (as well as for VaIN and AIN 2+ in a scenario analysis). Vaccine effect on persistent infe ction with HPV 6/11, 16 and 18 For boys, we used data from our systematic review (26), in which it is reported a six- month modified ITT relative risk (RR) esti mate of persistent in fection with HPV 16 and 18 among males of 0.33 (95% CI: 0.25, 0.44) . This is equivalent to a relative risk reduction (RRR) of 67% (i.e. E 2 = 0.67 in the infection models presented earlier). For girls, we used the same effect estimate as in our cost-effectiveness analysis of the catch-up vaccine for females ( 22), a RR of 0.26 (95% CI: 0. 16, 0.41), equivalent to a RRR of 74% (i.e. E 1 = 0.74) We did not find any evidence regarding th e reduction in persistence infection with HPV 6/11 , but we assumed the RR for HPV 16 and 18 would also apply to infection with HPV 6 and 11. 37 Methods Table 4.

(39) Vaccine effect on CIN 2 and 3 and cervical cancer We used the four year follow-up, ITT, RR estimate of experiencing CIN 2+ lesions from our previous systematic review (40), which was 0.80 (95% CI: 0.62, 1.02). This is equivalent to a RRR of 20%. Table 5. Relative risk (ITT) of experiencing CIN 2+.

For girls we used the four-year follow-up, ITT RR estimate from our previous systematic review which was 0.38 (95% 62%. Table 6. Relative risk (ITT) of experiencing genital warts (all HPV types).

(40) Vaccine effect on VIN/VaIN 2+ and vulvar cancer We used the RR estimate for VIN/VaIN 2+ for the ITT population after a four-year follow-up (40). The estimate was 0.49 (95% CI : 0.32, 0.76), leading to a RRR of 51%. Table 7. Relative risk (ITT) of experiencing VIN/VaIN 2+.

For that purpose, we used the RR estimate for HPV 6, 11, 16 and 18-related AIN for the ITT population after a three-year follow-up (26). The estimate was 0.46 leading to a RRR of 54%. The estimate was calculated from a male population, but due to the lack of data, we assumed it applied to females as well. Table 8. Relative risk (ITT) of experiencing AIN 2+. Vaccination vs. no vaccination Gender (follow-up) AIN (ITT), RR (95% CI) Source Boys (3 years) 0.46 (0.27, 0.79) Juvet et al. (26) Costs The total cost of vaccinating each cohort of 12-year-old boys starting in 2016 was calculated by summing the a ssociated additional vaccine costs and then subtracting the savings from the reduction in HPV 6/11, 16 and 18-related health outcomes. As mentioned earlier, we ca lculated total costs of the boys' vaccination program from two different perspectives: - Public health-care perspectiv e, which only includes costs to the National health budget (Value added tax, or VAT, included). - Societal perspective, which includes both costs to the National health budget (after extraction of VAT and other transfer payments between economic agents, as they are not real economic costs),the deadweight loss of taxation, the costs to patients for time used under treatment and the work-related productivity costs due to disease. Vaccine costs We calculated vaccine costs by multiplying the price per dose by the number of vaccine doses administered. The vaccine price in the base case was th e maximum pharmacy retail price (PRP) of the quadrivalent vaccine in December 20 14, NOK 1 113.4/dose (4 1). The model uses a scenario analysis to evaluate alternative, lower prices, probably closer to the actual tender price paid by the Norwegian health authorities, which is confidential. To calculate the number of administered doses per girl we used the proportion of ITT- and PPP-participants in four of the main studies in the systematic review we conducted in connection with our report on catch-up HPV-vaccination program (40): Future I (42), Future II (43), Future protocol 19 (44) and Patricia (45) . The result was an average of 2.78 doses per girl. 39 Methods For boys we conducted a similar analysis based on Giuliano (46), resulting in an estimate of 2.54 doses per boy. For mo re details, see Appendix 4. Costs. Finally, we used a coverage rate of 82% for both boys and girls based on feedback from the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. These rates apply for those having received at least one dose, as we used the effect estimates of the vaccine in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population, i.e. thos e that received at least one vaccine dose. Estimating cost savings due to vaccination We estimated total savings by multiplyin g the number of prevented HPV-related health outcomes, which we obtained with the help of the infection models, by the respective cost per prevented outcome. Each of the costs per prevented outcome cons ists of a series of inputs (diagnostic procedures, doctor payments, surgical procedures, medicines, patient travel time, etc.) classified according to disease an d treatment stage. In most cases, the treatment stages were: - medical assessment, where the righ t course of action was set, - primary treatment, - secondary/further treatment, in case of inadequate response to primary treatment, and - follow-up, usually up to the patient's de ath (alternatively up to 10 years). In order to obtain reliable estimates of resource use per case, we retrieved information from national and internat ional treatment guidelines, the Cancer registry of Norway, the Directorate of Health and the Oncology Encyclopedia (ONCOLEX). We also contacte d experts to obtain information about the course of disease treatment and/or costing of each of the health outcomes discussed earlier. The main sources of prices were the Norwegian hospital charges system, the Norwegian Medical Association, Norwegia n Medicines Agency, and some private providers of diagnostic services (see Appendix 4. Costs). Special issues regarding cost estimation from a societal perspective 1- Excluding VAT from costs: According to the Norwegian Ministry of Finance (23), when estimating costs from a societal perspective the value added tax (VAT) must be excluded from the purchase price of inputs as it repr esents a transfer of purchasing power from the purchaser (health-care providers, for example) to the State, and not a true cost. 40 Methods The key cost drivers in the model are the public price of the vaccine and the health-care costs accrued at hospit als for treatment of HPV-related outcomes. Excluding VAT is straightforward for the public vaccine price but not for hospital-based health-care costs since only some costs (for example, purchase of certain consumable goods) are subject to VAT while others are not (for example, wages). There is no published data specifying the share of health costs subject to VAT, so we estimated it by examining the operating costs reported by the four regional health trusts for 2011, and found that approximately 30% of costs may be considered VAT-liable (for more details, see Appendix 4. Costs). By assuming that this share also applied to the costs per HPV-related outcome in this model, we extracted th e VAT from 30% of each outcome cost when evaluating the HPV-vaccine from a societal perspective. 2- Deadweight loss due to tax funding: The Ministry of Finance has establishe d that deadweight loss of taxation must be included in economic evaluation s, regardless of sector (23). This loss is stated to be 20% of the net budget impact of implementation, which is calculated as the sum of necessary expenditures covered by the public budget minus all budgetary savings together with public sector's share of all associated productivity gains due to an increase in the number of working hours (currently set at 45%). In order to estimate the deadweight loss in our model, we used the following formula to estimate the net budget impact (NBI) of each vaccination program: 45% Where: IC Hcp = Incremental costs from the health-care perspective (compared to a situation without vaccination), as estimated by our model. PG Sp = Productivity gains from reduced number of cervical cancer and conisation-related preterm births ca ses (compared to a situation without vaccination). Then we multiplied the NBI by 20% and added the result to the incremental costs from a societal perspective of each vaccination program. 3- Monetary value of patient's time spent when receiving the vaccine or health treatment for HPV-related outcomes The monetary value of patient's time when receiving treatment for HPV-related outcomes was estimated by multiplying the number of spent hours 41 Methods (according to the experts we consulted) by our estimate of the hourly after- tax wage rate for 2013, NOK 186. This figure is based on average monthly pre-tax income data for full-time employees, NOK 42 500 (47), a tax wedge to the employee of 26% (48) and so me assumptions about the number of working hours (see Appendix 4. Costs for more details). We used the after-tax wage rate as we assumed that the alternative usage of that time was leisure. This is a conservative assumption as some cervical cancer patients may be of working age and employed, so that they may have to spend working hours to receive treatment. The value of the hours used by children in order to get the vaccine was not included in our analysis. Furthermore, as boys (and girls) will receive the vaccine during school hours, we assu med their parents would no experience loss of working time due to vaccination. 4- The monetary value of lost working time after disease We included the monetary value of lost working time after disease (i.e. the productivity costs) caused by cancer mortality and conization-related preterm births. Since there are no requirements in Norway as to how to estimate this monetary value, we proceeded as follows: First, we estimated the annual total labor costs per employee per year in Norway based on data from Statistics Norway and the OECD. The result, NOK 653 850, reflects both the direct costs (wage before taxes) and the indirect costs (payroll tax, pension costs, insurance, job training, etc.). Then, we multiplied the result by the expected number of working years lost due to every HPV 16 and 18-related cervical cancer and preterm (living) birth before week 33. We discounted future income using the discount rates set by the Norwegian Ministry of Finance. Finally, the results were adjusted by reducing them by 50% in order to account for compensation mechanisms in the labor market, as proposed by the Norwegian Directorate of Health (49). For further details, pl ease see Appendix 4. 42 Methods The costs per HPV-related outcome Estimated costs are shown in Table 9: Table 9. Estimated Norwegian cost per HPV-related outcome (2014-NOK) Treatment To public health budget To societya CIN 2 - a Deadweight loss due to tax funding excluded. b Premature birth delivery costs at hospital only. c Premature birth delivery costs at hospital plus long-term costs due to reduced productivity. d Used in sensitivity analyses only, not the base case. 43 Methods From a public health-care perspective, the costs of treating cancer are among the highest as these treatments require highly specialized services, usually over a long period of time. From a societal perspective there are two costs estimates that experience a sharp increase: - Cervical cancer . The treatment cost increases from approximately NOK 204,000 per case under the public health-care perspective, to approximately NOK 1,500,000 under the societal perspective. This is primarily because many of the patients are young (our calculations based on data from the Cancer Registry show a weighted average age at diagnosis of approximately 50) and still of working age, so that early cancer-related mortality may lead to a great expected loss of working years. - Conization-related costs. It includes both the expected medical costs per premature living baby delivery, the expected long-term treatment costs of the newborn due to increased morbidity and th e expected productivity costs due to life-time disability. The cost estima te increases from approximately NOK 260,000 to NOK 436,000 per case, also particularly because of the great expected productivity costs to the newborn. For further details regarding cost estima tion, please see Appendix 4. Costs. Quality-adjusted life years As in Chesson (13) and our previous report about catch-up vaccination (22), we calculated total age- and sex-specific numb ers of discounted quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) lost per outcome. The outcomes in the model are associated with a loss of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and/or life years. Each avoided outcome (e.g. cervical cancer or geni tal warts) thus yields a health gain. Literature search for EQ-5D values We did a systematic search for EQ-5D valu es in Medline and Embase in March and April 2014. Appendix 5. Health related qu ality-of-life (HRQL) data includes the search term combinations and results pe r search, for both the narrow and broader searches. In addition to the systematic search, we did some occasional reference list checking and searched in the EQ-5D reference database (50). Choice of the EQ-5D instrument For the time being, there are no requirements regarding the choice of HRQoL-instrument to use in health economic analysis in Norway. Since the generic preference based instrument EQ-5D is widely used and it is preferred by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in its technology appraisals (51), we decided to use it in th is report. Furthermore, since we expected 44 Methods that values elicited with the same descri ptive system and with index scores from the same tariff would be more consistent, we only included health state utility values from EQ-5D in the analysis. General considerations As in our previous report (22), we used a multiplicative approach to estimate the QALY-loss, assuming a fixed relative loss of HRQoL from a common general- population baseline across all age groups. Th is approach takes into consideration the natural decline in health due to age, an d consequently the absolute decrement in HRQoL due to a health state falls with age. A baseline HRQoL-weight of one (perfect health) irrespective of age would lead to an overestimate of the QALY-loss (52, 53). The outcomes in the Chesson model (13) were modeled independent of the natural history of disease. This is also the case for the QALY-calculations where we treat the precancerous lesions and associated cancers as independent events. The calculation of the QALY-loss We estimated the QALY-loss associated wi th the precancerous lesions and genital warts with the fo llowing formula: Here, \" T\" is duration of the health state measured in years, adjusted for the probability of death using age- and sex- specific all-cause mortality rates from Statistics Norway (54). Ignoring all-caus e mortality would have resulted in an overestimation of the QALY-loss, especially for the older age groups. \"B\" is the age-dependent baseline HRQoL value used for both sexes. The table below shows the baseline EQ-5D value for each ag e group in the model. The data is from the 1998 public health survey in Stockholm County, Sweden (55). The use of a general-population baseline have support in the literature if one assumes that the patients also have comorbidities (53). Finally, \"k\" is a multiplier we used in or der to approximate a fixed relative HRQoL- loss caused by the health state across all age groups. The multiplier represents the percent loss of HRQoL due to the HPV-related outcome. 1 The reference group HRQL-value is the HRQo L of those without the health state in question, but otherwise having similar characteristics as the patients. To avoid under- or overestimation of the QALY-loss, differences between the groups with respect to age, sex or other variables should be controlled for statistically. But when 45 Methods a reference value was missing in the study of interest, we chose to use the age- matched baseline data from Burstr\u00f6m (55) as the reference value, see Table 10. Table 10. Baseline EQ-5D values used in the model. Age groups HRQoL-weight - males and females (EQ-5D-3L) 12 to 19 0.890* 20 to 29 0.890 30 to 39 0.879 40 to 49 0.863 50 to 59 0.839 60 to 69 0.808 70 to 79 0.794 80 to 89 0.733 90 + 0.733* * Values extrapolated from the adjacent age group. The current discount rates specified by the Norwegian Ministry of Finance (23) were applied to outcomes with a duration of more than one year. The QALY-loss for precancerous lesions and genital warts Table 11 shows the QALY-losses for all age groups for the precancerous lesions and genital warts. Compared with the report on catch-up vaccinatio n of women (22), the estimates are higher for CIN 2+ and lower fo r genital warts. This mainly reflects our decision to include only EQ-5D-data in th e calculations. Appendix 5 includes tables with the calculation inputs and an overview of the included studies. Because we did not have data for VaIN, we used the QALY-loss associated with VIN as a proxy for that outcome. The choice was based on ex pert opinion (communication with Ingvild Vidstad). We assumed an average duration of an episode of 0.5 years, equal to that used in both the Chesson model (13) and our econ omic evaluation of the catch-up vaccination of women (22). For genital warts, we used the estimate of 147 days from disease onset to end of treatment, reported in Woodhall (56). 46 Methods Table 11. QALY-losses due to genital wart s and HPV-related precancerous lesions, by age Age group CIN 2+ VIN VaIN* GW (women) GW (men) 12 to to VaIN were only used in the scenario-analysis. The QALY-loss for cancer health states We describe the calculations for the cancer health states in appendix 5. The calculations generally follows the same fo rmula as above, but also considering the excess mortality associated with cancer. Table 12 shows the QALY-losses for all age groups for cervical cancer, vulvar cancer, vaginal cancer and anal cancer. The results for cervical and vulvar cancer were used both in the base case and in the scenario analyses, while the anal cancer and vaginal cancer results were used only in the scenario-analysis. The cancer survival data and disease stage at diagnosis for the different cancer types are the factors that influence the estimated QALY-losses the most. Tables wi th calculation inputs and an overview of the included studies are shown in appendix 5. Due to the lack of data regarding the HRQo L-loss associated with vulvar cancer and vaginal cancer, we used the HRQoL-data on cervical cancer as a proxy for those outcomes. Compared with the report on ca tch-up vaccination ( 22), the QALY-losses 47 Methods are however somewhat lower. This mainly re flects our decision only to include EQ- 5D-data, and not changes in the survival data. Table 12. QALY-loss due to HPV-related cancer, by age Age group Cervical cancer Vulvar cancer for vaginal and anal cancer were only used in the scenario-analysis. In one scenario analysis we examined th e cost-effectiveness of vaccinating boys when excluding the effect on morbidity, that is when only including the effect on mortality. Table 13 shows the life-years lost estimates associated with cervical cancer and vulvar cancer we used in that scenario analysis. 48 Methods Table 13.

The estimate does not include a QALY-loss for late abortions or premature births in week 33-36. We did not identify any HRQoL data related to conization-related complications in the lite rature search, so we based the estimate on an assumption of a lifetime loss of HRQoL of 25 % relative to the general population. See Appendix 5. Health related quality-of-life (HRQL) data for further explanation. Table 14. QALY-losses associated with HPV-related conization Outcome Base case Source Lifetime QALY-loss per preterm delivery with complications due to previous conization of the mother 5.66 Assumption QALY-losses associated wi th to HPV vaccination For the QALY-loss associated with a seri ous adverse event due to vaccination we used the same estimate as in our report on catch-up vaccination, 0.01 QALYs. Table 15. QALY-losses associated with se rious adverse events due to vaccination Outcome Base case Source QALY-loss per serious adverse event due to vaccination 0.01 Assumption 49 Methods Assigning distributions to the random variables in the model As discussed earlier, we implemented a probabilistic model by assigning a probability distribution to most vari ables. An important exception was the probability of HPV 6/11, 16 and 18-infection, which were excluded because the model could not be run as thei r values changed for each si mulation (their impact on the results was however examined in a on e way sensitivity analysis, see Scenario Analyses) The choice of distribution is based on the characteristics of the random variable at issue (range, confidence intervals) and th e recommendations from the literature. We followed Briggs et al. (19). Incidence rates of HP V-related outcomes We assigned a beta distribution to most in cidence rates. To fit the distribution we assumed that alpha ( ) was equal to the average annual number of cases based on the 2002-2012 data by age group provided by the Cancer Registry of Norway. To calculate the beta ( ) parameter, we substracted \" \" from the average number of females in that age group in the period 2002-2012, available at the website of Statistics Norway (17). The fit of the distribution for genital warts was perfor med differently since, as explained earlier, we only ha d incidence rates based on data from Kj\u00e6r et al. (29). The mean in every distribution was assume d to be equal to the estimate, while the standard error of the incidence was assumed to be 50 % of the value of mean. We then used the method of moments to estimate \" \" and \"\" based on the values of the mean and variance (the latter being the square of the standard error). Vaccine effect Vaccine effect estimates (RR) were assigned a lognormal distribution. The mean in every distribution was assumed to be equal to the estimate, while the standard error was calculated using the values of the estimate's 95% confidence interval. Costs We assigned a gamma distribution to each cost item. The fit of the distribution was the same for all costs variable s in the sense that our cost estimate was assumed to be the mean value and the standard error, 50% of that mean. Then we used the mean and the standard error to estimate both \" \" and \"\" (19). QALY-losses We used a lognormal distribution fo r the QALY-loss for each age group. Alternatively one could have directly a ssigned a distribution to the random 50 Methods components of the QALY-losses, namely mo rtality (both the annu al mortality for the general population and the five-year mortality for the cancer patients), HRQoL- weights (both for the general population and the cancer patients) and the patients cancer stage distribution at diagnosis. Ho wever that approach would have required knowledge of the specific distribution of each of these variables, something we did not have, so for simplicity we assumed th at the uncertainty around all of these parameters would be captured by assigning a lognormal distribution to each of the QALY-losses. The fit of the distribution was the same for all QALY-losses. We assumed the available estimate was the mean value (m) and then assigned the standard error (v) a value equivalent to 50% of that mean. Th en we used \"m\" and \"v\" to estimate the \u00b5 and parameters of the lognormal distributi on using the following expressions (57): 51 Results Results We calculated the epidemiologic impact, lifetime costs and HRQoL-gains of both vaccinating boys and girls aged 12 and of va ccinating only girls (current vaccination program), based on 1 000 simulations of the model (see Appendix 1. for more details). We present the results using the Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER). The ICER is the difference in costs between the two alternatives divided by the difference in QALYs or life-years gained, and is on e of the factors decision makers may pay attention to when considering implementation/decommission of health-care programs. We also present the results for Net Heal th Benefit (NHB), Net Monetary Benefit (NMB), Expected Value of Perfect Info rmation (EVPI) and Cost Effectiveness Acceptability curves (CEAC) for a range of different willingness-to-pay values. We present the results from our base case analysis first and then examine the different scenario analyses conducted to explore the robustness of the base case results. See Context of resu lts section (in the Discussion section) for help when interpreting the results in this report. Estimated epidemiologic impact of vaccination of boys against HPV infection We estimated the total reduction in the incidence of the relevant HPV-related outcomes during the first hundred years af ter the implementation of vaccination of boys in addition to girls aged 12, compared to no vaccination. For the estimation and comparison of the reduction in incidence fo r different vaccination strategies, please see the Scenario Analyses section. Our model predicts a gradual reduction in the population incidence rate of all relevant outcomes as the share of vaccinated cohorts increases over time. Other factors influencing the intensity and the ti me profile of the incidence reduction are the vaccine effect estimates and diseases' average onset age. In Table 5. Relative risk (ITT) of experiencing CIN 2+. Vaccination vs. no vaccinationTable 5 we show the 52 Results time profile of the percent reduction in po pulation incidence rate s a selection of the outcomes: a. Genital warts incidence am ong males and females seems to be the outcome for which the greatest reduction after 100 years is estimated, approximately 82% and 76% respectively. The reduction among females is greater than zero already at first year of the program for boys because of the existence of the current vaccination for girls only. The genital warts incidence rates exhibit the most rapid decline among all outcom es, with a reduction of more than 50% within twenty years after implementation, probably due to the early onset of the disease. b. The reduction in vulvar cancer inci dence after 100 years would also be considerable, approximately 57%, but due to the late onset of this disease, it would take several decades before the reduction becomes noticeable. c. The incidence reductions for cervical cancer and CIN 3 (and most probably CIN 2 as well) were considerably lower than for the other outcomes, reflecting the fact that the effect estimate on CIN 2+ from our systematic review also was considerably lower. The reduction becomes noticeable relatively quickly, especially for CIN 3, as data from Cancer Norway shows that the number of cases re ach a maximum by age 25-39. Figure 5 summarizes our results. For detail s on the calculation, see Appendix 3. Vaccine effect: Figure 5. Time profile of the percent reduction in population incidence due to vaccination of males and females, compared to no vaccination. Based on these results, the incidence rate s presented in the Epidemiology section and population data for 2014 from Statistics Norway (17), we estimated the (undiscounted) number of avoided cases between 2016-2115 for vaccination of girls 53 Results only and for vaccination of both boys and girls, compar ed to a situation without vaccination. The results are presented in Table 16: Table 16. Undiscounted number of avoided HPV-related outcomes between 2016-2115, compared to no vaccination Vaccination program Avoided cervical cancer cases Avoided vulvar cancer cases Avoided CIN 3 cases Avoided genital warts (among males) Avoided genital warts (among females) I. Only girls ( 82% coverage) 4,355 1,488 33% 17% Our model predicts that vaccinating boys in addition to girls aged 12 will lead to additional avoided HPV-re lated outcomes every year between 2016-2115: On average 6 cervical cancer cases, 2.5 vulvar cancer cases, 67 CIN 3 cases and 1,016 genital warts (643 among males and 373 among females). The additional number of avoided cases ranges between 14% (cervical cancer and CIN 3) and 33% (genital warts among males) of the reduction at tained by only vaccinating girls. See Appendix 3. Vaccine effect for details on these calculations. Base case Incremental Co st-effectiveness Estimates Cost-effectiveness results when conducting the analysis from a public health-care perspective Below we present the results, based on the average of the costs and effects simulated of 1 000 iterations in the model. The incr emental costs/effect of vaccinating both boys and girls aged 12 vs. the current program (vaccination of girls aged 12 only) were calculated by subtracting the incremental costs/effect of the current program vs. no vaccination from the incremental costs/effect of vaccinating both boys and girls aged 12 vs. no vaccination (l abelled II-I in Table 17 below). 54 Results Table 17. Expected incremental costs and effects of vaccinating boys and girls vs. vaccinating girls aged 12 only. Public health-care perspective. Intervention Incre- mental cost vs. No vacc.

This implies an ICER of NOK 1,789,463/QALY. This valu e was generally considered to high in several recent decisions by the Norwegia n health authorities, suggesting that vaccination of boys is not cost-effective. See the Context of results section for help interpreting this result. Below we show the scatter plot of the 1 000 iterations of the model, where the incremental effect is displayed along the x-axis and the incremental costs along the y-axis: Figure 6. Cost-effectiveness scatter plot of va ccinating boys and girls aged 12 vs. only vaccinating girls. Public health-care perspective. 55 Results All iterations were located in the upper right quadrant, where both the incremental costs and effect of the vaccination progra m are positive. This means that our model supports the hypothesis that adding the boys vaccination program results in better health outcomes (in the form of more QA LYs) than keeping th e current vaccination program, but at higher costs. Figure 6 al so highlights a negative relationship between the incremental cost and the incremental effect, because an increase in the number of avoided cases leads to greate r costs savings and, therefore, lower incremental costs. However, th e relationship seems weak. Table 18 reports both the incremental ne t health and monetary benefit (INHB and INMB) for different WTP values. Positive values for the INHB and INMB suggest that adding a vaccination program for bo ys to the current vaccination program would be cost-effective, while the opposite is true for negative values. For a WTP equal to the ICER of the program (1,789, 463 NOK/QALY) both measures are equal to zero. Table 18. Incremental net health and moneta ry benefit of adding the boy vaccination program to the current vaccination prog ram. Public health-care perspective. WTP (NOK/QALY) Incremental probability that adding vaccination of boys to the current program is cost- effective as a function of the WTP can be examined in the cost-effectiveness acceptability curve (CEAC), in blue in figure 7. Figure 7. CEAC (blue, left axis) and EVPI (green, right axis) in the base case. Public health-care perspective. 56 Results The CEAC indicates that the probability that boys vaccination program is cost- effective is 0%, 2%, 26% 0.5, NOK 1, NOK 1.5 and NOK 2 million. The expected value of perfect information (EVPI) curve can be interpreted as the upper bound on the returns to further resear ch about the costs and effect of a health program (i.e. the returns of eliminating 100% of the uncertainties in the results of the analysis). For the vaccination program for boys and girls, the EVPI reached a maximum of approximately NOK 233 million at a WTP equivalent to the ICER. This means that if the expected costs of additional research were lower than NOK 233 million, it may at a WTP equivalent to the ICER be cost-effective to reduce uncertainty by conducting further resear ch and wait for the new results before deciding whether the program vaccination fo r boys should be implemented or not. For WTP values below NOK 800,000/QALY, on the other hand, the returns to further research are zero, as it seems fairly improbable that boy' s vaccination is cost- effective at a price of 1,113.4 /dose. In other words, more knowledge is not likely to change this fact for WTP values close to those shown by Norwegian health authorities in recent decisions (see Context of results). The dispersion around the mean incremental cost in the scatter-plot seems to be relatively smaller than the dispersion around the mean incremental effect, which suggests that further research on the e ffect estimates may give most value for money. This is discussed further in Scenario Analyses . Cost-effectiveness results from a societal perspective: Below we present the average results, based on 1 000 iterations of the model, when conducting the analysis from a societal perspective. Table 19. Expected incremental co sts and effects of vaccinating boys and girls aged 12 vs. vaccinating girls only. Societal perspective. Intervention Incremental cost vs. No vacc. (NOK) Incre- mental effect 247,059,107 7,366.21 1,677,319,569 1,031.40 1,626,261 II. 12- year- old boys + Current program 1,924,378,676 8,397.61 57 Results The differences in the results between the two perspectives primarily reflects cost differences. From a societal perspective, the incremental costs were 9% lower, NOK 1.677 billion vs. NOK 1.851 billion in th e public health-care perspective (the incremental effect was slightly lower from this perspective due to the way the model is built up, not to real effect differences betwee n perspectives). The ICER was NOK 1,626,261/QALY, which is lower than in the public health-care perspective. This is probably because th e exclusion of VAT, together with the inclusion of productivity benefits of redu cing the numbers of cervical cancer cases and premature births, more than outweighs the inclusion of deadweight costs of taxation associated with the need of pu blic funding for the vaccination program. Figure 8 shows the scatter-plot of the ICER from the societal perspective: Figure 8. Cost-effectiveness scatter plot of vaccinating boys and girls aged 12 vs. vaccinating girls aged 12 only. Societal perspective. The societal perspective scatter-plot sh ows that both the costs and effect of introducing boys to the vaccination program were positive in all iterations, and that the dispersion of the incremental cost was greater than in the health-care perspective. This is probably because disp ersion in the incremental effect is to a certain degree incorporated in the incremental cost through the inclusion of productivity gains. This is also most probably the reason why the negative 58 Results correlation between the incremental effect and the incremental costs is now stronger than in the analysis from a health-care perspective. Table 20 reports both the incremental ne t health and monetary benefit (INHB and INMB) for different WTP values. Table 20. Incremental net health and mone tary benefit of adding the vaccination program for boys to the cu rrent vaccination program WTP (NOK/QALY) Incremental Net Benefit results from the CEAC (blue curve in Figure 9) show that the probability of the boys vaccination program to be cost-effe ctive is 0%, NOK 1, NOK 1.5 and NOK 2 million. The expected value of perfect informatio n (EVPI) curve (in green in Figure 9) reaches a maximum value of approximat ely NOK 225 million from a societal perspective, for a willingness-to-pay of NO K 1,626,261/QALY. This means that if the expected costs of additional research were lower than NOK 225 million, it may be cost-effective to reduce uncertainty by cond ucting further research and wait for the new results before deciding whether the program vaccination for boys should be implemented or not. Figure 9. CEAC (blue, left axis) and EVPI (green, right axis) in the base case, societal perspective. 59 Results Scenario Analyses The scenario analyses make it possible to examine the impact on the results of changes in specific model assumptions and/or variable values. We conducted eight scenario analyses: The first investigated the effect of a lower vaccine purchase price per dose. The second excluded the effect of the vaccine on genital warts in order to examine the cost -effectiveness of using a bivalent, rather than quadrivalent vaccine. The third evaluated the cost-effectiveness of increasing the coverage among girls instead of vaccinating boys. The fourth scenario analysis is the base case results in the public health perspective for life-years gained (LYG), i.e. without the HRQoL-impact of vaccination. In the fifth scenario analysis, we estimated the ICER when incorporating the vaccine effect on anal cancer (in both genders) and vaginal cancer, as well as on VaIN 2+. In the sixth scenario analysis, we excluded the effect of the vaccine in reducing the number of conization-related preterm births. In the seventh scenario analysis, we examined the cost-effectiveness of vaccinating boys when only administering two doses while obtaining the full vaccination effect reported in published studies. Finally, in the eight scenario analysis we estimated and compared the re duction in the incide nce of the several relevant outcomes under diffe rent coverage assumptions. In addition, we conducted a series of on e-way analysis where we examined how the base case results changed when increasing or reducing certain groups of variable (epidemiologic, effect, costs, HRQoL) by 25 %. We present the results in the form of a Tornado diagram. Alternative prices Our analysis assumes that the HPV vaccine is purchased at the maximum pharmacy retail price (PRP), NOK 1,113.40/dose in December 2014. We examined three alternative scenarios, with per dose prices of NOK 250, NOK 500 and NOK 750, from a public health-care perspective. The incremental costs declined 81%, 57% and 34% for a price of NOK 250, 500 and 750/dose, respectively. Since lower prices do not affect incremental health effect, lower incremental costs resulted in lower ICERs. These results show that in the price range NOK 250-1,113.4/dose, a 10% reduction in the dose price leads to a redu ction in the ICER of approximately 10.3%. Figure 10 illustrates the cost-effectiv eness results for each vaccine price. 60 Results Figure 10. ICERs for base case and alternative quadrivalent vaccine price/dose scenarios Excluding vaccine effect on genital warts Although the quadrivalent vaccine used in the base case analyses is the one currently offered in the HPV vaccination program, a bi valent vaccine is also available. Both vaccines are administered following a 3- dose schedule. The bivalent vaccine, however, does not provide protection against genital warts. We conducted a scenario analysis in which we excluded the vaccine's effect on genital warts and assumed that the bivalent and quadrivalent vaccines had the same price (NOK 1,113.40/dose) and effect. This allowed us to both estimate the cost- effectiveness of the bivalent vaccine and to ascertain the price at which the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of the bivalent and quadrivalent vaccines were the same. All boys and girls aged 12 in both strategies were assumed to receive the bivalent vaccine in this scenario analysis . Table 21 provides results from a public health-care perspective. Table 21. Estimated cost-effectiveness of the bivalent vaccine. Public health-care perspective. Intervention Incremental cost vs. No vacc.

The result is an ICER of NOK 3.75 million/QALY, which means that the willingness-to-pay of the decision-maker has to increase considerably, from NOK 1.789 million/QALY to NOK 3.751 million/QALY, for the vaccination of boys with the bivalent vaccine to be considered cost-effective. Based on these results, the price at which the bivalent vaccine reaches an ICER equivalent to the one of the quadrivalent vaccine, i.e. NOK 1.789 million/QALY, is approximately NOK 550/dose, equivalent to a price reduction of 50.6%. These results are not surprising: Although the treatment co sts and loss of quality of life associated with ever y genital wart episode are low compared to other HPV- related outcomes (e.g. cervical cancer), the condition occurs much more frequently. In addition, a top is reached at a younger age, so that the co st savings and HRQoL- gains are discounted less heavily than for other outcomes (e.g. cancer). Increasing coverage among girls aged 12 instead of vaccinating boys In this scenario analysis we evaluated the cost-effectiveness of increasing first dose coverage (currently at 82%) among girls aged 12 instead of vaccinating every cohort of boys and girls at the current coverage rate. As agreed with the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, we increased coverage from 82% to 92%. This vaccination strategy le d to a reduction in the number of HPV-related outcomes higher than when vaccinating girls only (at an 82% coverage rate) but lower than when vaccinating both boys and girls (also at an 82% coverage rate).

The result is an ICER of NOK 336,755/QALY, which suggests that increasing coverage among girls is more cost-effective than for vaccinating boys. However, our estimated incremental costs of increase d coverage do not include th e costs associated to such strategy (awareness campaigns, special targ eting of left-out groups, etc.), so this ICER must be interpreted with caution (see al so Discussion for more details on this). Table 24 provides the results of comp aring a vaccination program with 82% coverage of both boys and girls aged 12 to a girls-only vaccination program with 92% coverage. Incremental costs of vaccinating boys would almost the double compared to increasing coverage among girls ag ed 12 (NOK 1.648 billion), while the incremental effect would be approximately 6% higher (432.1 gained QALYs). Consequently, the ICER for adding boys to the vaccination progra m is substantially higher than in the base case (NOK 3, 815,093/QALY vs. NOK 1,789,463/QALY). Table 24.

This effect estimate was not included in the base case because its relevance for the general population was questionable, as it was estimated amon g a population consisting exclusively of men who had sex with men. We also excluded from the base case the effect estimate (taken from our previous systematic review) of a catch-up vaccinat ion on VaIN 2+ and did not use it to extrapolate it to vaginal cancer as we di d with the effect on VIN 2+ and vulvar cancer. We based this decision on expert opinion (personal communication with Ingvild Vistad) that VaIN 2+ is not consid ered a good predictor of future vaginal cancer on its own, as this cancer form of ten appears together with cervical and/or vulvar cancer. However, because both anal and vaginal cancers often are included in HPV-vaccine models, we conducted a scenario analysis incorporating these cancers in order to facilitate comparison with other studies. Table 26 provides the results from a health-care perspective and at a price of 1,113.4/dose. 64 Results Table 26. Estimated cost-effectiveness of boy vaccination, anal and vaginal cancer included.

Excluding the vaccine effect on co nization-related preterm births We assumed in our base case that vaccination against HPV may prevent a number of preterm births related to the conization status of the mother because women who have undergone conization before pregnancy, have a greater risk of experiencing preterm deliveries (30-32). As far as we know, incorporating this vaccine effect in HPV-models is not usual, so we examined how the base case results changed when we excluded it. The analysis was conducted from a health-care perspective and used the public price, 1,113.40/dose. Table 27.

Administering two vaccine doses instead of three The European Medicines Agency (EMA) endorsed in 2014 the introduction of a 2- dose schedule in individuals aged 9- 13. The endorsement was based on data indicating that the immune responses to tw o doses of Gardasil given to girls aged 9- 13 are at least as good as those in wome n aged 16-26 who were given three doses, which are the populations in which effi cacy has been demonstrated (58). We conducted a scenario analysis in which everyone getting the vaccine received two doses, while assuming that the estimated effect in our systematic reviews still applied. The analysis was conducted from a health-care perspective and used the public price, 1,113.40/dose. Table 28. Estimated cost-effectiveness of a vaccination schedule of two doses.

This resulted in an ICER of NOK 1.389 million/QALY, also approximately 22% lower than in the base case. Comparison of the estimated epidemiologic impact of different HPV-vaccination strategies We estimated and compared the reduction in the incidence of several HPV-related outcomes under different coverage assumptions: 1. Vaccination of girls aged 12 only, with 82% of every cohort receiving at least one dose (current situation). 2. Vaccination of girls aged 12 only, with 92% of every cohort receiving at least one dose. 3. Vaccination of boys and girls aged 12, wi th 82% of every cohort receiving at least one dose (the strategy in focus in this report). 66 Results The results are shown in the following table: Table 29. Percentage reduction in the inci dence rates of some HPV-related outcomes, 100 years horizon (2016-2115). Outcome Vaccination of girls aged 12 - 82% coverage Vaccination of girls aged 12 - 92% coverage Vaccination of girls and boys aged 12 Cervical cancer 22% 23% (females) 64% 69% 76% Depending on the outcome, including bo ys in the vaccination program led to incidence reductions after 100 years that were 1-9 percentage points higher than increasing coverage among girls and 3-13 pe rcentage points high er than vaccinating only girls at the current coverage ra te. The greatest incidence reduction accomplished by vaccinating boys was registered for genital warts among males, 82%. See Appendix 3. Vaccine effect for more results. Tornado diagram We examined how varying the values of groups of variables affected the ICER from a health-care perspective in one-way analyses. The results of these analyses are plotted in Figure 11, in a Tornado diagram. The black, vertical line indicates the value of the base case ICER from a health-care perspective (NOK 1,789,463/QALY). The blue bars indicate the value of the ICER when the average value of all variables in a given group is reduced by 25%, while the orange bars indicate the value of the ICER when the average value of all variables in a given group are increased by 25%. 67 Results Figure 11. Tornado diagram. One-way analyses. Health-care perspective. Changes in the vaccine effect estimates had the greatest impact on the base case results: When assuming a 25% higher relative risk (i.e. a lower vaccine effect in terms of relative risk re duction), the ICER experienced an 80% increase, while assuming a 25% lower relative risk led to a 20% decrease. This asymmetry is due to the fact that the ICER is the incremental co st times the reciprocal of the incremental effect, so that for a given positive incr emental cost, a decrease in the positive incremental effect always has a greater (or at least equivalent) impact on the ICER than an increase. The incidence rates of HPV-re lated outcomes was the next group of variables in this analysis with greatest effect on the ICER , with a 34% increase when assuming 25% lower incidence rates and a 20.5% decrease when assuming 25% greater incidence rates. The HRQoL-loss relative to the general popu lation baseline (k) had an impact on the ICER of approximately +23%/-16% for valu es of k 25% lower/greater than in the base case, while changes in the value of the HPV-acquisition rates and treatment costs had a substantially lower impact, +/- 5% and +/-1%, respectively. 68 Discussion Discussion In this health-economic analysis we have evaluated the epidemiological impact and the cost-effectiveness of ad ministering vaccination against HPV-infection to boys aged 12 in addition to the current practice of vaccinating girls aged 12, compared to maintaining the current practice. Summary of results In our base case analysis we assumed that 82% of all boys and girls aged 12 would get on average 2.54 and 2.78 doses of the HPV-vaccine, respectively. Furthermore, we assumed that the vaccine would only have an effect on the pe rsistent infection, genital warts and precancerous lesions as documented in our own systematic reviews (26, 40), and extrapolated the effect on precancerous vulvar lesions to vulvar cancer and the effect on precancerous cervical lesions on cervical cancer and conization-related preterm births. Finally, the price of the vaccine was set equal to the maximum PRP of the quadrivalent vaccine, NOK 1,113.40/dose (NOMA, December 2014). From a health-care perspective, the base ca se results showed that including boys in the current vaccination program would lead to a discounted, incremental cost of NOK 1.851 billion and an incremental health gain of 1,034.59 QALYs. This resulted in an ICER of NOK 1,789,46 3/QALY. The scatter plot of the ICER showed that both the incremental costs and the health ga in were positive for all iterations. The expected value of perfect information (E VPI) curve, which can be interpreted as the upper bound on the returns to further research about the costs and effect of a vaccination program for boys and girls, reached a maximum of approximately NOK 233 million at a WTP equivalent to the ICER . This means that if the expected costs of additional research are lo wer than these returns to the EVPI, then it could be cost- effective to conduct further research when the WTP is 1,789,463/QALY. The ICER of vaccinating boys from a societal perspective is lower than from a health perspective. The incremental costs were approximately 9% lower, NOK 1.677 billion vs. NOK 1.851 billion in the public health -care perspective, while the incremental effect was the same, leading to an ICER of NOK 1,626,261 /QALY. 69 Discussion We conducted several scenario analyses to explore the effect of changing a variety of assumptions from the base case. The results were as follows: - Using prices of NOK 250, 500 and 750/dose result ed in lower incremental costs and therefore lower ICERs of NOK 351,975/QALY, NOK 765,909/QALY and NOK 1,186,606/QA LY, respectively. - Excluding the vaccine effect on genital wa rts from the analysis resulted in both somewhat higher incremental costs and a considerably lower incremental health effect than in the base case. The ICER was then NOK 3,754,854/QALY. Assuming these results apply to the biva lent vaccine, and that the price of the quadrivalent vaccine is equal to the public price of NOK 1,113.40/dose, we estimated that the price of the bivalent vaccine had to be approximately NOK 550 /dose or lower in order to be as cost-e ffective as the quadrivalent vaccine. - Increasing the first dose coverage among girls aged 12 from 82% to 92% instead of vaccinating boys of same ag e resulted in a 42% lower incremental effect and a 89% lower incremental cost than vaccinating boys. The ICER is then NOK 336,755/QALY, considerab ly lower than the ICER of the vaccination program for boys. The ICER of vaccinating boys and girls aged 12 at an 82% coverage rate vs. vaccinating girls only at a 92% coverage rate was approximately NOK 3.815 million/QALY. - Ignoring all HRQoL-gains (reduction of morbidity) and focusing exclusively on lifetime gains (reduction in mortality) in terms of life-years gained (LYG) resulted in a 71% decrease in the nominal incremental effect of the program, compared to the base case (where reductions in both morbidity and mortality are taken into account). This may be due to the large HRQoL-gain associated preventing genital warts, an importan t outcome for males in our model. The lower incremental effect leads to a considerably higher ICER of approximately NOK 6.2 million/LYG. - Incorporating the potential effect of the vaccine in reducing the number of cases of VaIN 2+ and vaginal and anal cancer, reduced the ICER to NOK 1,538,578/QALY. - When excluding the vaccine effect in reducing the number of conization-related preterm births, the ICER increased to NOK 1,848,515/QALY. - Assuming all vaccinated children get two vaccination doses each, led to an ICER of NOK 1,389,853/QALY, approxim ately 22% lower than in base case. - Depending on the outcome, including bo ys in the vaccination program led to incidence reductions after 100 years that were 1-9 percentage points higher than increasing coverage among girls and 3-13 percentage points higher than vaccinating only girls at the current coverage rate. The greatest incidence reduction accomplished by vaccinating boys was registered for genital warts among males (82%). - Finally, our one-way analyses showed that changes in the incidence of HPV- related outcomes and the HRQoL-losses associated with these outcomes had 70 Discussion a considerable impact on the cost-effecti veness results, although less than the impact of changes in the vaccine e ffect estimates. Changes in the HPV- acquisition rates and treatment costs had very limited impact on the results. Context of results As mentioned earlier (see Priority setting criteria), there is no official cost- effectiveness threshold value in Norway . This means that health authorities themselves, case-by-case have to ascertain whether the relationship between the costs and effectiveness of a health in tervention/program are reasonable, and therefore whether they are willing to pay the required price per QALY or not. In the course of this assessment, heal th authorities may choose to compare the resulting ICER-values with the values of other programs that previously have been subject of an economic evaluation and whic h were (or were not) implemented in the National Health Service. We have identified some recent decisions that may work as a basis for comparison: - Dymista (flutikason) for the treatment of moderate to severe allergic rhinitis: The Norwegian Medicines Agency accepted in 2013 the uptake of Dymista in the list over preapproved medicines for outpatient treatment (bl\u00e5 resept) based on an ICER of NOK 72,000-12 4,000/QALY (59). The analysis was conducted from a limited societal perspective, i.e. when excluding the deadweight loss due to tax funding and the monetary value of lost working time due to sickness. - Tasigna (nilotinib) for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML): The Norwegian Medicines Agency accepted in 2013 the uptake of Tasigna in the list over preapproved medicines for ou tpatient treatment based on an ICER of approximately NOK 373,000/QALY, when evaluated from a limited societal perspective (60). - Avastin (bevacizumab) for the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer: The four Norwegian Health trusts have in 2014 approved the use of Avastin (61). The ICER was between NOK 491,508-650,264/QALY (depending on the length of the follow-up in the clinical study) wh en evaluated from a limited societal perspective. - Rotavirus vaccine: In 2014, the rotaviru s vaccine was included in the children vaccination program in Norway, more specifically the monovalent vaccine (Rotarix). The ICER was NOK 687,000/QALY from a health-care perspective and NOK 27,500/QALY and from a societal perspective (62) - Picato (ingenolmebutat) for the treatm ent of actinic keratoses on trunk and extremities: The Norwegian Medicines Agen cy rejected in 2014 the uptake of Picato in the list over preapproved me dicines for outpatient treatment based on an ICER of approximately NOK 800,000/QALY, when evaluated from a limited societal perspective (63). 71 Discussion - Jevtana (kabazitaksel) for the treatment of metastatic, castration resistant prostate cancer: The four Norwegian Heal th trusts have in 2014 rejected the use of Jevtana based on an ICER of approximately NOK 1,400,000/QALY when evaluated from a limited societal perspective (64). We made the list of examples in order to help the reader in contextualizing the results in this report. It is important to emphasize that this list must be interpreted with caution. The examples are not exhaustive as only decisions made in 2013-2014 are included. And perhaps most importantl y, because other criteria than cost- effectiveness play an important role in the decision-making, the health gains of different patient groups may be valued diffe rently by Norwegian health authorities. An alternative approach when considering whether a health program is cost-effective or not is to compare the ICER of that program with an estimate of the actual cost per QALY in the health services. This alternative approach is closely linked to the concept of opportunity cost of scarce resources within a fixed health budget. Based on empirical data on health sector resource use and associated QALYs gain, researchers in the UK have estimated the NICE cost-effectiveness threshold to be \u00a312,936/QALY (65). In this opportunit y-cost framework, the implementation of an intervention with a cost per QALY gain ed higher than \u00a312,936/QALY would lead to a net loss of QALYs because it would di splace other interventions with a better cost per QALY ratio. A similar cost-per-QALY value has not yet been estimated for the Norwegian health- care sector. The Norwegian Directorate of Health's conversion to the Norwegian setting of the UK estimate resulted in an ICER of approximately NOK 215,000/QALY (66). Thus, according to th is approach, HPV-vaccination of boys and girls aged 12 at a price of NOK 1,113.4/d ose, clearly would not be cost-effective compared to vaccination of girls only. 72 Strengths and weaknesses of this report Data sources Most of the epidemiological and costing data we used in this ec onomic analysis were from Norwegian sources, strengthening the relevance of the results for a Norwegian setting. In addition, most of the data were retrieved from published literature or publicly available sources (such as the Cancer registry of Norway), which increases the transparency of our results. Target population and sexual behavior The results of our analyses are based on a simulated population in which sex with people of the same gender is not considered, i.e. the results may not apply to the same extent to women having sex with women and men having sex with men. The herd immunity effect may be particularly weak for unvaccinated men having sex exclusively with other unvaccinated men. Mortality rates We incorporated gender spec ific death rates (per 100 000-year) from Statistics Norway for 2013 and assumed that they would apply for the period 2016-2115. Alternatively, we may have assumed increasi ngly lower future mort ality rates, as the Norwegian population has experienced a larg e increase in life expectancy since the Second World War (mainly because of redu ced mortality in most age groups) and recent data indicates that this is a continuing trend (67). Incorporating increasingly lower mortality rates in our model would mean that the number of persons in each age group wo uld grow progressively, and the age at death, increase. This would imply a pote ntially higher number of prevented HPV- related health outcomes and therefore greater vaccine effect in the vaccinated cohorts. However, the consequences of lower death rates would accrue far in the future and would be heavily discounted, limiting the effect on the relationship between total incremental costs and effects. Furthermore, the background mortality was slightly overestimated as we did not adjust it for HP V-related mortality (which is reflected in the QALY-losses caused by HPV-related ou tcomes). For example, cervical cancer mortality was 1.9 per 100,000 pe rsons-year in 2012 (68). 73 Screening and vaccination A key simplification of our model was to assume that current cervical cancer screening in Norway was reflected in the ob served rates of cervical cancer that we applied in our model. We also assumed that vaccinated women would not change their behavior regarding complian ce to the screening program. HPV-acquisition probability rates We lacked Norwegian data on the HPV 6/11, 16 and 18 acquisition probability rates among those experiencing infection for the first time. The only data we had was the prevalence rates for those same types, for females aged 17 and 21. To obtain acquisition rates we based our calculations on the Norwegian prevalence rates for those two age groups and the age profile of the acquisition probability rates in the original model (13). More specifically, we assumed that the age profile of HPV-infection in Norway (although not the level) is similar to the one in the United States. If HPV-incidence for the vaccine types in Norway turns out to be lower than our estimates, we would expect higher incremental costs and a smal ler health gain, resulting in a slightly higher ICER, as suggested by our results in the Tornado diagram. Incidence rates of genital warts The incidence rates for genital warts on which we based our calculations may underestimate the real incidence rates, as the original data in Kj\u00e6r et al. (29) do not take into account recurrent genital warts episodes. This may underestimate the cost- effectiveness of the quadrivalent vaccines as recurrence rates ob served in clinical trials of anogenital warts therapies range among studies and treatments, from 9% to 80% (28). Effect estimates in the target population We used the vaccine effect estimates for relevant HPV-related outcomes from our systematic review on catch-up HPV vacci nation of young females (40) and on vaccination of boys (26), both of which includ ed the latest findings in the literature for females and males. These findings showed that the vaccine had effect on cervical and vulvar precancerous lesions as well as on genital warts, and we incorporated these effects in our analysis. In addition, we assumed that the effect on precancerous lesions (CIN 2+ and VIN 2+) also applied to cervical and vulvar cancer despite not having found any evidence on this. This assumption is based on the expected relationship between precancerous lesions and cancer cases. If this relation does not exist or is weaker than assumed in our mo del, then the costs savings and the health 74 gain from the vaccination program for bo ys may be overestimated, and the ICER higher. The effect estimates for precancerous lesi ons and genital warts are based on results from clinical trials that mainly included young women and men aged 16 and older. The effect estimates for these outcomes may be more favorable in our target population (boys and girls aged 12), in whic h the vast majority of the individuals not yet have been exposed to HPV infection. It is difficult to predict the impact on the ICER of vaccinating boys and girls: Although most probably it will result in a higher health gain among boys compared to no vacc ination, it may as well lead to a lower incremental gain compared to vaccinating girls only. The inclusion of potential prevented orop haryngeal, penile cancer and/or JoRRP cases most probably would lead to greate r cost savings and a higher incremental effect, and thus to lower ICERs. The time horizon of the model is an important variable when assessing vaccine programs as their consequenc es may take years to unfold, for example through the development of herd immunity. Short time horizons may ignore the long-term effects and consequences of the program wh ile very long time horizons may not add relevant information beyond a certain point in time as the accrued effects and costs would be heavily discounted. We chose the sa me time horizon as in Chesson, i.e. 100 years, as we considered it long enough to capture all relevant consequences of introducing vaccination of boys from eith er a public health-care or societal perspective. We assumed that the vaccine provided life long immunity, as we did not find any data indicating a waning effect. If the effe ct of the vaccine did decrease some years after vaccination, the incremental effect would probably fall and the incremental costs increase. Finally, we did not incorporate cross-prot ection against other HPV-types than the ones targeted by the quadrivalent vaccine. If cross-protection does exist and is incorporated in our model, it would incr ease the number of HPV-related events prevented by the vaccine, thus increasing the effect and reducing the incremental costs of the vaccination program for boys, which in turn would result in a lower ICER. Alternatively, the ICER estimates would have been higher if we had included the potential increase in negative heal th outcomes caused by HPV types not protected against by vaccination, Chesson (24). 75 Costs Ideally, resource use data and costs shou ld come from studies following those who were vaccinated and those who were not in order to ascertain the differences between these groups. We were however unable to find such data. Instead, we based the average costs of treating lesions, ca ncer, genital warts and conization related outcomes in the model on the recommendations from Norwegian experts, public price lists, etc., which strengthens the transferability of the estimates to a Norwegian setting. The number of doses per vaccinated female in our model is 2.78, lower than the average number of doses per female that results from using the actual, average vaccine coverage rates in Norway (for fema le cohorts born 1998-2001), currently at 2.91 doses. We did not however use 2.91 because 2.78 was the average number of doses that every vaccinated female received in the studies included in our systematic review (40), so that our effect estimates we re associated to this particular vaccine consumption pattern and no other. The model does not include the cost to the public health system of vaccine wastage or of administering each vaccine dose (in a recent economic evaluation of second generation pneumococcal co njugate vaccines in Norway (69), the authors used a vaccine administration cost of NOK 81/per do se). It does not include either the cost associated with increasing coverage am ong girls in that particular scenario. Nevertheless, one may use our price sensit ivity analysis to approximate how the inclusion of these costs may affect the base case results for prices per dose between NOK 250 and 1,113.4). Suppose that these co sts lead to a 10% higher cost per dose. Then, our model estimates that the ICER would be increased by 10.3% NOK/QALY (see Scenario Analyses for details). The model does not incorporate the value of time spent by the patient's caregiver, which in the case of terminal cancer patien ts or newborns with serious sequelae due to a preterm birth, may be substantial. Incorporating the value of the saved caregiver's time in the analysis from a soci etal perspective may reduce the ICER of vaccinating boys from a societal perspective. The calculation of costs from the societal perspective is based on several assumptions. We assumed that the alternative use of the time spent by the patient receiving treatment was leisure and not wo rk. Furthermore, we did not include the productivity costs due to cancer morbidity, only those due to cancer mortality. Both assumptions may lead to an underestimatio n of the productivity costs due to HPV- related events. On the other hand, the productivity costs we included in our model assumed full employment in the relevant patient groups, which may overestimate the true productivity costs. Despite all these shortcomings, our analysis is, to our 76 knowledge, one of the few that includes such productivity costs in the assessment of HPV-vaccination of boys, givi ng a more accurate picture of the consequences for society of introducing a va ccination program for boys. The exclusion of the VAT from treatm ent costs was made based on our own assessment of the size of the VAT-liable share, as we did not find nationwide data. More precise data on this share would increase the precision of the costs estimates. We did not include transportation costs (car usage, train tickets, etc.) to patients and the health-care system, neither patient copayments when undergoing health treatment. Including these would reduce the ICER so that boy vaccination would appear to be more cost-effective. Finally, in order to take all uncertainty around our estimates into account, we assigned distributions with wi de confidence intervals to al l average cost estimates. HRQoL With no published age or gender-specifi c EQ-5D data from the general Norwegian population, we chose to use the gender-neutral EQ-5D -weights from a Swedish population (55) as the baseline for the loss of HRQoL. For those studies that did not report a reference value, we used the baseli ne data in the calculation of the relative loss of HRQoL due to the heal th state. Consequently, the baseline data have a high impact on our calculations of the relative HRQoL-losses associated with different HPV-related outcomes. Although we did co ntrol for age by using the age-matched data for the reference population, our calc ulations did not statistically control for other potential sources of variation in HRQoL between the patients and the reference population. This adds to the unce rtainty of the calculat ion of the relative loss of HRQoL, and may lead to an over - or underestimatio n of the QALY-loss associated with the HPV-rela ted outcome. The strength of our approach is however that it is consistent across the different outcomes. Since we did not find relevant weights for either VIN 2+, VaIN 2+, vaginal or vulvar cancer, the adverse events of the vaccine or the conization-related long-term consequences of preterm births, we made assumptions regarding the HRQoL-losses associated with these outcomes. We did not identify any Norwegian HRQoL-data in the literature search, which may limit the transferability of the model results to a Norwegian setting. The relative loss of HRQoL associated with a health state may vary with age (53). Our assumption of a fixed relative loss acro ss all age strata, for all the outcomes may 77 as a result lead to an over- or underest imation of the QALY-loss for the young and old age groups. If one assume that the error is random across all the outcomes, the assumption may not lead to wrong estimates, but with no information regarding this relationship for our outcomes it is unce rtain how large the error is and how we should have corrected for it. All these factors taken together contribute to the uncertainty around our results. In order to consider this great uncertainty, we assigned distributions with wide confidence intervals to all QALY-losses (as we did with the average cost estimates). This may be one of several factors explaining the large variation of the incremental effect across model iterations, shown in Figure 6 and Figure 8 . Our results compared to other findings/other reviews Several publications have ex amined the cost-effectiveness of male vaccination in different settings when taking into acco unt both the direct and indirect (herd immunity) effect of the HPV vaccine. One of these publications is a recent cost-effectiveness analysis of vaccinating boys in Norway by Burger and colleagues (12). They reported an ICER (from a societal perspective) of approximat ely NOK 363 000/QALY ($60,100/QALY) when 900 ($150/dose). These results are 41% and 45% (respectively) lower than our results for similar prices. Several factors may explain why our ICER-estim ates are higher (not exhaustive list): - Burger et al. includes some outcomes in their base case we do not include, specifically, vaginal, anal, oropharyngeal and penile cancer, as well as juvenile recurrent respiratory papillomatosis. - Burger and colleagues used ATP (Accor ding to Protocol), RRR estimates on HPV 6/11/16/18-related disease of 1 00% for females and 90% for males, considerably higher than the ITT estimates we used, with the lowest being 20% for CIN 2+ and the highest, 62 % for genital warts among females. - Burger et al. do not seem to include vaccination adverse events, while we do. On the other hand, there are several factors suggesting that our ICER estimates should be lower than in Burger and colleagues (not exhaustive list): - Burger et al. do not seem to include co nization-related preter m births, while we do. 78 - Our estimates of the cost savings pe r avoided HPV-related outcome were generally higher. - We applied our (lower) effect estimates on a greater share of each cohort, 82% vs. 71% in Burger et al. The net impact of all these choices may explain why the ICER-results in Burger et al. were lower than in our analysis. Kim and colleagues (16) assessed the cost -effectiveness of incl uding boys in the HPV-vaccination program in the United States in addition to vaccination of girls and screening with cytology. Assuming a three-dose schedule and a price of approximately NOK 720/dose ($120/dose), they estimated that vaccinating 75% of all boys and girls aged 12 resulted in a ICER close to NOK 1.2 million/QALY ($200,000/QALY). This result applied from a societal perspective and is higher than ours for a similar dose price (a pproximately NOK 1 million/QALY). Chesson and colleagues developed and used the model we adapted for Norway when they examined the cost-effectiveness of male HPV vaccination in the United States (13). They estimated that for a total co st (price per dose, administration and wastage) of approximately NO K 1,000/dose ($167/dose) an d a coverage rate for all three doses of 75% (for both genders), the ICER of male vaccination in addition to vaccination of girls aged 12 was approximately NOK 2.6 million/QALY ($436,000/QALY) from a societal perspective. This result almost doubles ours for a similar price (approximately NOK 1.4 million /QALY), although it should be noted that their result was based on the assumption of no vaccine effect on outcomes other than cervical cancer, cervical precancerous lesions and genital warts (in both genders). Elbasha and colleagues (14) assessed the cost-effectiveness of vaccinating boys and men age 9-26 compared to vaccinating girls and women only. For a price of approximately NOK 800/dose ($133/dose) and a coverage rate for the first dose of 80% by age 26 among women and 48% among men, the ICER of male vaccination in addition to female vaccination wa s approximately NOK 414,000/QALY ($69,000/QALY). This result applies when on ly including vaccine effect on cervical, vaginal and vulvar disease in addition to genital warts (in both genders), and it is considerably lower than ours for a simila r price per dose (approximately NOK 1.1 million/QALY). Based on the model by Elbasha and coll eagues, a cost-effect iveness analysis of gender-neutral vaccination in Austria wa s published in 2014 (70). As mentioned earlier, Austria is the only country in the European Union where gender-neutral vaccination has been recommended. The results show that for a total cost per 79 vaccine dose (price and administration cost) of NOK 960 (\u20ac 120), the ICER of vaccinating 65% of girls and boys aged 9 alongside cervical screening was NOK 126,560 (\u20ac 15,820) compared to cervical screening alone (no vaccination). This result applied when including the effect of the vaccine on cervical, vaginal and vulvar cancer as well as genital warts. Jit and colleagues (15) assessed the cost-effe ctiveness of vaccinatio n of boys at age 12 in addition to girls. They estimated th at for a total cost of approximately NOK 700/dose (\u00a370/dose) and a coverage rate for the three doses of 80% among boys and girls aged 12, the ICER was approx imately NOK 5.2 mill ion/QALY a healthcare provider perspe ctive. This ICER applies when including only the vaccine effect on cervical disease and genital warts (in both genders), and is considerably higher than our result for a similar price (approximately NOK 1.1 million/QALY). Pearson and colleagues (71) examined the cost-effectiveness of adding vaccination of boys aged 12 to the girls vaccination prog ram in New Zealand. Their results show that for a total cost per vaccine dose (pri ce and administration cost) of NOK ICER of vaccinatin g girls and boys aged 12 vs. only vaccinating 45-56% of girls aged 12, The ICER of vaccinating 73% of gi rls and boys aged 12 vs. on ly vaccinating 73% of girls aged 12, was NOK 1,407,000 (NZD 247,000). These results applied when including the effect of the vaccine on cervical, vulv ar, oropharyngeal and anal cancer, as well as CIN 1, 2 and 3 and genital warts. 80 Conclusion From both perspectives and given the current public price of NOK 1,113.4/dose of the quadrivalent vaccine, va ccinating boys in addition to girls aged 12 years is probably not cost-effective. The incremental ICER was NOK 1,789,463/QALY from a health perspective and NOK 1,626,26 1/QALY from a soci etal perspective. Although there is no official cost-effectiv eness threshold value in Norway, such high ICERs are generally associated with th e intervention not being accepted for implementation in the Norwegian health sector. The price scenario analysis shows that a lower price per vaccine dose has a major, positive effect on the cost-effectiveness of the program. Increasing coverage among girls aged 12 from 82% to 92% seems to be more cost- effective than vaccinating both boys and gi rls at coverage rate of 82% (when only taking into account the cost of purchasing additional vaccine doses). Finally, the price of the bivalent vaccine should not be higher than approximately NOK 550/dose for it to be deemed as cost-effective as the quadrivalent. Need for further research Our systematic review revealed the lack of reliable data regarding the effect of the vaccine on cancer. In addition , the knowledge we have on the duration of the vaccine effect on precancerous lesions and geni tal warts is limited. Furthermore, new studies enrolling participants of ages closer to that of the target population in the Norwegian HPV-vaccination program (12 years old) would help to reduce the uncertainty around the transferability of our results. These are very important issues, as our one-way analyses showed that changes in vaccine effect estimates had a great impact on the cost -effectiveness results. 81 Finally, there is a need for more EQ-5D data of high quality on the HRQoL of HPV-related outcomes as well as Norwegian general population data with the EQ-5D instrument. Implications for practice The annual target population of a vaccination program for boys consists of approximately 25 420 boys (82% of each co hort, which by January 2014 consisted of approximately 31 000 boys). If the mean coverage rate reaches 82% for the first dose, 69.3% for the second dose and 56.7% for all three doses, approxim ately 121 000 additi onal doses will be required every year to implement HPV-vaccination of boys aged 12, starting in 2016. At the current maximum PRP (NOK 1,113.4/dose), that implies an additional expense of approximately NOK 135 million per year. For more details regarding this calculation, see Appendix 6.

On the inner wo rkings of the Excel model The model calculates the differences in health effects and costs between the chosen intervention and no vaccination (the situat ion in Norway before 2009). This means that in order to examine the differences between the current situation in Norway and a potential program of vaccinating bo ys beginning in 2016, the model had first to be run 1 000 times the comparison of ea ch of these interventions against the \"no vaccination\" option. Then the results fo r these two separate comparisons were collected and compared to calculate the relevant ICER. Appendix 2. Epidemiological data HPV 6/11, 16 and 18 annual acquisition pr obabilities in the absence of vaccination used in the original model To estimate type-specific ac quisition probabilities, Chesso n and colleagues (13) used age-specific probabilities of acquisition of high risk HPV types from previously published models, smoothed the data to al low for gradual changes and finally used US-data about the percentage of high risk HPV infection attributable to HPV 16 and 18. For HPV 6 and 11 they used a combined probability of infection. The annual probability of HPV 6/11 acquisition has prev iously been estimated at approximately 2% for women aged 18 to 35 years, and the annual probability of HPV 6 acquisition has been estimated at approximately 2.5% for sexually-active, college-aged women. Chesson and colleagues then applied these es timates as follows: They assumed that the annual probability of HPV 6/11 infect ion would be 0% for ages 9 years and younger, 2% for ages 10 to 16 years and ages 24 to 29 years, and 3% for ages 17 to 23 years. They assumed that the annual prob ability of HPV 6/11 acquisition for ages 30-34 years would be 25% less than that of ages 25-29 years, and that the same 25% reduction would hold for subsequent five -year age groups. This 25% reduction in 90 HPV 6/11 acquisition probabil ities was based on the approximate relative reduction in the probability of ge nital warts with age. They then smoothed these HPV acquisitio n probabilities to allow for gradual changes in the probability of HPV acquisit ion with age, using a process similar to that described above for HPV 16 and HPV 18. Age-specific acquis ition probabilities for women over age 60 years were estimated by assuming that the probability of HPV 6/11 acquisition would decrease by 10% annually after age 60. HPV 6/11, 16 and 18 annual acquisition pr obabilities in the absence of vaccination used in the Norwegian model Because we did not have access to the data that Chesson and colleagues used to estimate these probabilities for the United States, we estimated the acquisition probabilities for Norway through the prevalence rate of the respective HPV-type in Norway. The only Norwegian prevalence data we had was yet unpublis hed data about HPV- prevalence in females aged 17 and 21 years in 2014 from the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. In order to estimate the prevalence rates for all age groups we first estimated the prevalence of each HPV-type in the United States as described in Chesson (13). Then, based on the relation ship between our two Norwegian point estimates and the estimated prevalence in the United States at age 17 and 21, we extrapolated to obtain the Norwegian prevalence for age group between 8 and 16 and 22 and 85, and interpolated to obtain the prevalence for age group 18, 19 and 20. Once we had estimated the Norwegian prevalence rates per age group, we were able to calculate the acquisition probabilities by reversing the calculations in the original model. We thereby assumed that the HPV 6/ 11, 16 and 18 infection time-profile and the relationship between prevalence and incidence rates in Norway is the same as in the United States, more specifically that th e annual probability of infection clearance was 0.45 for HPV 16 and 18 and 0.75 for HPV 6/11. Percentage of health outcomes a ttributable to di fferent HPV types Table 30 shows the percentages attributable to different HPV types that were used in the original model (for those outcomes included in the Norwegian adaptation). These determine to the degree to which the number of total cases of each outcome 91 may be reduced by vaccination. Totals be low 100% indicate that these four HPV types are not the sole reason for these outcomes. Table 30. Percentages of health outcomes attr ibutable to HPV 6/11, 16 and 18. Original model Health outcome HPV 6/11 HPV 16 HPV 18 Total CIN 58.60% CIN Genital warts 90.00% - - 90.00% In our model, we used other percentages, see Table 31: - For cervical cancer, CIN 2 and 3 and ge nital warts we used 100%, because all these outcomes are HPV-related (8, 72) and our effect estimates applied independently of which HPV-type caused them. - For vulvar cancer we used 90% because it is the share of vulvar cancers that are squamous cell carcinomas (73), close to 100% of all squamous cell carcinomas take place after development of VIN (personal communication with Ingvild Vistad) and our effect estimate on VIN applies to all types of VIN (not only to those HPV-related, which ar e approximately 60% (73). - For vaginal cancer (only examined in a sensitivity analysis) we used the same percentage as for vulvar cancer, due to similar etiologies. - For anal cancer (only examined in a sens itivity analysis) we used 82.8%, based on data from the United States suggesting that 90% of all anal cancers are due to previous HPV-infection, of which 92% were due to HPV 16 and 18 (8). We multiplied 90% by 92% because our effect estimate on precancerous anal lesions (AIN 2+) applied only to those wh ich were HPV 16 and 18-related. In order to estimate the percentages attrib utable to HPV 6/11, 16 and 18, we took into account the proportions between these HPV-types in Chesson (13). The results are shown in Table 31. 92 Table 31. Percentages of health outcomes attr ibutable to HPV 6/11, 16 and 18. Norwegian model Health outcome 6 and 11 16 18 Total CIN 2 - 91.81% 8.19% 100% CIN 3 warts (both genders) 100% - - 100% * Used only in scenario analysis Incidence rates of genital warts We based our calculations on data for the youngest cohort in the dataset from Kj\u00e6r (29), i.e. those born between 1979 and 1986, as we assumed that their infection time-profile would reflect the pattern for fu ture cohorts in the most accurate way. This may overestimate the burden of geni tal warts among cohorts born before 1979. On the other hand, we may underestimate the burden among future cohorts, as the cumulative incidence has grown rapidly over the last 30 years: For example, while the cumulative incidence in the cohort born 1964-68 first reached 12% at an average age of 42, that value was reached in the cohort born between 1979-86 at an average age of 27. We had data on the 1979-86 cohort until they reached age 27. From this point, we assumed the cumulative incidence curve woul d level out as the cohort aged, as was the case for the previous cohorts, reaching 16% at age 45. We then assumed the cumulative incidence grew at an annual rate of 0.5% from age 45-60, then at 0.25% from age 61-80, with no further growth beyo nd age 80. It should be noted that this age profile, while hypothetical, yields a flatter time profile than the ones registered for the older cohorts, i.e. it may be an op timistic forecast of the burden of genital warts among future cohorts. In order to estimate the incidence rates of genital warts, we first calculated the survival curve S(t) from the cumulative in cidence rate in age group in Kj\u00e6r (29). This is possible because the cumulative incidence can be defined as F(t), the cumulative distribution function, which is the complement of S(t). Based on the literature (74), we then assumed that th e incidence rate in every age group was equivalent to the hazard function h(t) fo r that age group, defined by the formula: 93 Conization-related preterm births Albrechtsen (34) reported data from No rway showing that 141 371 births were registered as preterm births in the period 1967-2003. Of these, 769 took place before week 33 of gestation and among mothers having undergone conization prior to pregnancy. This is equivalent to 0.0344% of all births in that period. Although a woman may have given birth to several of th ese children, this fact does not change the conclusions of this analysis, as what we are interested in is the consequences for the newborn. Table 32. Births in Norway, 1967-2003 Births before cervical conization Births after cervical conization No cervical conization TOTAL In Table 33 we present the distribution of births per outcome, according to the mother's conization status, in order to examine whether there is a correlation between these two variables: Table 33. Share of births per outcome, according to mother's conization status Births before cervical conization Births after cervical conization No cervical 1 and 2 94 Table 34. Preterm deliveries before w eek 33 and after conization, 1967-2003 Number of deliveries before week 33 and after cervical conization 769 = (234 + 535) As % of total number of deliveries 0.0344% The data show an increased frequency of preterm births among mothers that underwent conization before giving birth, while the two other groups' shares are almost identical. Were the frequency among births after conization equivalent to the frequency in for example the no conization group, the shares would have looked more as shown in Table 35: Table 35. Births after conization if shares were similar to the situation without conization Births after cervical conization (1967-2003) Shares from births other than after conization Normal 14 164 93.75% Late Abortion 59 0.39% week 24-27 55 0.36% week 28-32 160 670 4.43% TOTAL 15 108 100% Source: Own calculations In this hypothetical case, the number of de liveries before week 33 would be 215 (late abortions not included), equivalent to 0.00 96% of all births. This means that only 0.0248% (= 0.0344% - 0.0096%) of all preterm births may with some certainty be attributed to the fact that the mother had a conization before pregnancy. Given that 58 991 births were registered in Norway in 2013 (SSB), 0.0248% of these means approximately 15 births. Table 36.

Based on the percentages of health outcomes attributable to HPV 16 and 18 mentioned earlier, we assumed that approximately 0.0228% of all births in a given year are preterm births or late abortions due to HPV-16 infection and 0.0020% due to HPV-18 infection.

AGE male female 8 0.000096 0.000067 9 effect Calculation of the number of avoided HPV-related outcomes in the model We calculated the number of avoided HPV-related outcomes (N) for each independent cohort (of males or females) at age \"a\" and year \"t\" of the vaccination program using the following formula: ,,,, 100,000 ,, Where: Ra is the rate of the outcome (per 100,000-year) in age group \"a\" in the absence of vaccination, POP a,t is the number of females/males in age group \"a\" at time \"t\", ATTRIB X is the percentage of the outcome attributable to the relevant HPV type, Cg,a,t is the reduction (for ge nder \"g\") in the cumula tive acquisition of the relevant HPV type due to vaccination as estimated by the infection model, \"Lag\" is a disease-specific lag term. AR is the adjustment ratio, used to adjust the effect of the vaccine. The lag term and AR are explai ned more in detail below. The lag term The lag term was included by Chesson an d colleagues in the original model to establish a minimum time between vaccination and the prevention of a given health 100 outcome. Although protection against th e HPV vaccine types was assumed to begin after completion of the vacc ine series, the authors applie d the lag term so that the adverse health outcomes averted by vaccin ation would accrue over a plausible time frame. For cervical and other cancers, the authors used a minimum lag time of 5 years such that reductions in cancer for a given age co hort would not be observed in the first 5 years in which members of that cohort we re vaccinated. The lag term applied was 1 for CIN 1, 2 for CIN 2, 3 for CIN 3, and 0 for genital warts. We have used these same lags in the Norwegian model, Chesson and colleagues examined the impact of alternative lags on the results for the cost-effectiveness of ma le vaccination and they did not change substantially when no lag term was applied or when the lag terms for all health outcomes were doubled. Adjusting the vaccine effect with AR As mentioned earlier, we performed a systema tic review to obtain data on the effect of the vaccine on persistent infection with HPV 6/11, 16 and 18 as well as precancerous lesions and genital warts. The results showed that the effect of the vaccine was different across health outcom es, so we adjusted the results of the model as explained in Chesson (13), appendix 1, page 11. This adjustment allowed us to approximate the value of avoided cost s and QALY-losses associated with the reduction in HPV-related health outcomes. More specifically, we calculated the ratio of relative risk reductions (RRR) between the vaccine effect on each health outcom e and on persistent HPV 6/11, 16 and 18- infection for every iteration of the model, and then multiplied this adjustment ratio (AR) by the number of avoided HPV-rela ted outcomes in that iteration. For example, if in a given iteration of th e model, the vaccine leads to a RRR for persistent infection of 70% but only 25% for CIN 3, then the ratio (0.25/0.7 = 0.3571) would be multiplied by the number of avoided CIN 3 cases, as calculated by the infection mode l (see above). Moreover, the effect estimate on persistent infection applied fo r a one-year period, while the estimates of the vaccine effect on CIN 2+, VIN 2+ and genital warts are all calculated at three to four years. In order to apply the adjustment we assumed that the latter effect estimates also appl ied to annual periods of time. 101 Diagrams of the estimated yearly epidemiologic impact of vaccination of boys We estimated the yearly percent reduction in the population incidence of several HPV-related outcomes (cervical and vulvar cancers, CIN 3 and genital warts) during the first hundred years after the implementati on of vaccination of boys in addition to girls aged 12. For this analysis, all vari ables were assumed to be deterministic. In order to estimate the yearly percent reduction for each relevant HPV-related outcome, we used the following formula: ,, , Where: - t: Program year (1 t a: Age. - g: Gender. - b: HPV-type (6/11, 16 or 18). - CI: Reduction in cumulative exposure to HPV type \"b\", given age \"a\" and gender \"g\". - AR: Outcome-dependent adjustment of the vaccine effect on HPV-acquisition (see discussion above). - Age incidence share: Gender-dependent share of the total average number of cases (2002-2012) registered in the group of age \"a\". - HPV-incidence share: Share of the number of case s of the relevant outcome caused by HPV-type \"b\". Comparison of the estimated epidemiologic impact of different HPV-vaccination strategies Following the method above, we estimate d the reduction in several HPV-related outcomes under three different vaccination strategies, in the 100 years period after introduction (2016-2115): 1. Vaccination of girls aged 12 only, with 82% of every cohort receiving at least one dose (current situation). 2. Vaccination of girls aged 12 only, with 92% of every cohort receiving at least one dose. 3. Vaccination of boys and girls aged 12, wi th 82% of every cohort receiving at least one dose (the strategy in focus in this report). Our results show that most of the vacc ine effect (in terms of incidence rate reduction) of vaccinating bo ys aged 12 would be obtained by increasing coverage 102 among girls aged 12. The only exception to this observation is the incidence of genital warts among males, which experiences a greater reduction, probably thanks to the direct protective effect of vacc ination among males (see figures below): Figure 12. Reduction in genital warts incidence among females from year 1 to 100 103 Figure 13. Reduction in genital warts in cidence among males from year 1 to 100 104 Figure 14. Reduction in vulvar canc er incidence from year 1 to 100 105 Figure 15. Reduction in cervical cancer incidence from year 1 to 100 106 Figure 16. Reduction in CIN 3 incidence from year 1 to 100 Appendix 4. Costs Vaccination costs As described earlier, the va ccination costs are calculated as the product of the vaccine price per dose and the number of doses administered. The price used in the base case from a public health-care perspective was the maximum pharmacy retail price (PRP) of the quadrivalent vaccine in December 2014, NO K 1,113.4/dose (41) . From a societal perspective, we excluded the VAT from the public price (i.e., the price was divided by 1.25). For the calculation of the number of administered doses per patient we used the number of ITT- and PPP-partic ipants in the main studies in our systematic reviews (26, 40). We did this to match the effect estimates as reported in the studies with the estimated number of doses n eeded to achieve that effect. More specifically, for girls we retrieved from these studies the share of the ITT- population that received three doses (i.e. the PPP-population) and calculated a weighted average of these shares, with the weights being the number of patients in 107 the ITT-population in each study. The result was 85 .3%. The rest of the ITT- population, 14.7%, was assumed to be equally distributed between those that received one or two doses only, i.e. 7.35%. Table 40.

Gi uliano and colleagues reported that 69% of the ITT population received all three vaccine doses. Table 42. Share of ITT-male population receiving all three doses in a selection of studies Study ITT-population PPP Share of ITT population receiving 3 doses Giuliano (46) 4 055 2 805 69% The rest of the ITT-population, 31% was a ssumed to be equally distributed between those that received one or two doses only, i. e. 15.5%. This resulted in an average of 2.54 doses per boy: 108 Table 43. Estimated share of the male ITT-po pulation receiving one, two or three doses Number of doses Share of ITT-population Weighted number of doses 1 15.5% 0.16 2 15.5% 0.31 3 69% 2.07 SUM 100% 2.54 Average cost per HP V-related outcome We calculated an average cost per patient and outcome, so that both the differences in treatment course and the probability of diagnosis and treatment outcomes were taken into account. As described earlier, each of the costs per prevented outcome consists of a series of inputs (diagnostic procedures, doctor pa yments, surgical procedures, medicines, patient travel time, etc.) classified according to disease and treatment stage. As the detailed explanation of how the cost of each outcome was estimated would be too lengthy to be included in this report, we de cided for the sake of brevity to go through the estimation of the cost per cervical canc er case and use it as example of how the rest of the costs per outcome were estimated. The choice of outcome is not arbitrary as cervical cancer is one the most important outcomes to consider when evaluating a HPV-vaccination program. Additionally, the estimation of the costs per cervical cancer case proved to be the most complicated in the model, due to the heterogeneity of the course of the disease and its treatment. Ingvild Vistad, gynecologist at the S\u00f8rlan det sykehus HF, in estimating costs, although we are resp onsible for the final choice of values. For cervical cancer, as for all other cancer forms included in the model, we divided the treatment into four consecutive phases: Medical assessment, primary treatment, secondary treatment and follow-up. i. Medical assessment: This phase starts after the patient has tested positive for atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US)/Low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) at the mass cervical cancer screening program. 109 The patient would undergo cytology and an HPV-test, which requires a visit to her general practitioner (GP). If the results show high-grade cytology (regardless the result of the HPV-test) or AS-US/LSIL and positive HPV-test result, the patient would undergo a colposcopy and a biopsy, both undertaken by a gynecologist. Up to this point, we assumed the patient would have used 3 hours of her time travelling to both the GP and gyneco logist and undertaking the procedures. The total cost per item is calculated by multiplying the unit cost and the number of units required. The unit cost for health services at the hospital is the corresponding share of the value of a Di agnose Related Group (DRG) point, NOK 40 772 in 2014. Table 44.

Primary treatment: Once the medical assessment of the patien t is completed and the cancer stage is determined, the primary treatment phase starts. Data on cancer stage distribution at this point was obtained from Haldorsen (75). Table 46. Patient distribution among canc er stages at the beginning of primary treatment (Norway). Cervix cancer stage IA 11.8% Cervix cancer stage IA1 11.8% Cervix cancer stage IA2 11.8% Cervix cancer stage IB1 11.8% Cervix cancer stage IB2 11.8% Cervix cancer stage IIA 10% Cervix cancer 10% Cervix cancer stage IIIA and IIIB 11% Cervix cancer stage IVA and IVB 10% Total 100% 111 The treatment plan will depend on both the stage of the patient's cancer and on other factors such as patient's life situat ion (e.g. fertility-preserving surgery or trachelectomy for young patients in stage IA2 or IA planning to have children) and adequacy of treatment to patient's clinical picture (e.g. giving chemotherapy or not together with radiotherapy to patients in stage IIA).

The result of the primary treatment is assessed within three months after ended treatment by a gynecologist or a gyneco logic oncologist, by means of clinical examination, ultrasound and occasionally imaging examinations. It is expected that 80% of all patients will experience a total tumor remission, followed by control visits to the gynecologist or gyneco logic oncologist every three months for two years, then every six months for three years, and finally yearly control visits to the GP for ten years. Some other 10% of patients are expected to experience a partial tumor remission. A gynecologist or a gynecologic oncolo gist would then examined the patient conducting a magnetic resonance imagin g (MR), a computed tomography (CT) and in some cases a positron emission tomography (PET). The final 10% of patients are expected to suffer residual disease or inadequate clinical response. After asse ssing patient's disease, secondary treatment consisting mainly of surgery and/or radiotherapy will be advised. The results of this secondary treatment will then be evaluated in a similar way to the primary treatment. Table 48 Treatment cour se in the follow-up phase, cervical cancer.

Expected costs per treatment phase Based on the estimated costs per treatment phase and the patient distribution among cancer stages and treatment outcomes , we calculated the following expected costs per treatment phase.

In order to calculate the expected costs to society, one has to add to this estimate the time costs to the patient as well as to correct for VTA and the deadweight loss due to tax funding, as well as the associated productivity costs. These two latter elements are discus sed (on a general basis) below. Extracting VAT when estimating co sts from a societ al perspective: The following table shows the share of total operating costs that each cost item represents in the four health regional tr usts' annual report and accounts for 2011. The last column shows the (arith metic) average for all trusts: Table 50. Reported shares of operating costs per regional health trust, 2011. Year 2011 Regional health trust Arithmetic average Cost category South-East West North Central Purchase of health services 13.4% 14.6% sold\" and \"Other operating costs\" as the VAT-liable cost categories. Their shares were summed up, resulting in a total sh are of 35.1%. Nevertheless, as \"Purchase of health services\" in its turn consisted of both VAT-liable and not liable components (for example, wages paid by subcontractors), for simplicity we just rounded down the share to 30%. Then to calculate the cost without VAT we used the following relationship: Y = X*(1-0.3) + X*(0.3/1.25) = X*(0.7+0.24) = X*0.94 116 Which expresses that by extracting the VAT from 30% of the cost per outcome was equivalent to considering 94% of the to tal expense from a public health-care perspective. Monetary value of patient's time sp ent when receiving health treatment We multiplied the number of hours spent by patient to get health treatment by our estimate of the hourly after-tax wage rate for 2013, NOK 186, based on Norwegian average monthly pre-tax income data from Statistics Norway, NOK 42 500 (47), and some assumptions. More specifically we assumed that the number of working hours per month was 169 (= 4.5 weeks x 37.5 working hours/week) and that the average income tax rate was 26%. This last rate wa s based on the rate reported at the OECD database (48). Productivity costs in the analysis from a societal perspective: We calculated the productivity costs (i.e. the monetary value of the expected loss of working years) associated with early cancer-related mortality and preterm births (i.e. births before week 33). For early cancer-related death, we did as follows: - First, we calculated the average age at di agnosis by means of a weighted average, the weights being the shares of patients diagnosed at the respective ages. - Then we subtracted this average age from 67, the expected retirement age. - We subtracted five additional years from the result, based on the assumption that no patient dies due to the cancer du ring the first five years after diagnose. - We then multiplied the result (only if positive) by the average five-years mortality rate for that particular cancer type, which yielded the expected loss of working years due to early death, five years after cancer diagnosis (Cancer registry of Norway). Assuming, that all di agnosed patients survive until year five and that thereafter the survivors experience the same mortality rates as the rest of the population may be considered conservative. - We assumed that the monetary value of every lost working year would be equal to the annual average pre-taxes total labor costs in Norway for 2013 (NOK 653 850), multiplied by the correction factor proposed by the Norwegian Directorate of Health to account for compensation mechanisms in the labor market (50%). The total labor costs were calculated by adding together the direct and indirect costs to the employer: The direct costs are the annual average pre- taxes wage from SSB, NOK 510 000 (47), while the indirect costs include the 117 payroll taxes, pension costs, insurance, in kind benefits, job training, etc. Data from SSB shows that the indirect costs' share of the total costs in Norway was 22% in 2008 ( SSB). - Finally, we discounted each of the corrected values and added them up, obtaining an approximatio n of the true discounted monetary value of the expected loss of working years due to early cancer-related death. The formulas for the calculation are: X = 50% N = (67 - A - 5) * M 5-year Where: X = Discounted, expected monetary va lue of lost working years due to cancer mortality = Average pre-taxes annual wage at year t. r = Discount rate (4%, as the time horizon was shorter than 40 years) N = Expected loss of working years per cancer case, five years after diagnosis A = Weighted mean age at diagnosis (own calculations based on data from the Cancer registry of Norway) M5-year = Average 5-year mortality rate for all stages among patients aged > 50 118 Table 51. Estimation of productivity co sts due to early cancer mortality. Disease (67-5) Weighted average age at diagnosis (A) Diffe- rence (years)5-year mortality rate at diagnosis (M5-year ) Expected lost working- years time due to cancer mortality, five years after diagnosis (N) Discounted monetary value of lost working years time due to cancer mortality (X) Cervical cancer 62 50.36 11.64 36.20% 4.21 1 295 750 Vulvar cancer 62 70.36 No expected loss of working years - - - Vulvar cancer 62 70.36 No expected loss of working years - - - Anal cancer (female) 62 66.55 No expected loss of working years - - - Anal cancer (male) 62 65.43 No expected loss of working years - - - Each cervical cancer results in an expect ed loss of approximately 4.21 years in the labor force while the losses caused by other cancers are expected to be zero. Given the average annual pre-taxes income in Norway for 2013, the expected loss caused by cervical cancer would represent a di scounted loss of approximately NOK 1.3 million per case (corrected for compensati on mechanisms in the labor market). In addition, we calculated the productivity costs due to preterm births. Soergel (76) presents German estimates of the long-term costs of conization-related preterm deliveries. In order to be conservative, we chose to use the estimate for mild disabilities, 40,000 euro, which we converte d to NOK by applying a rate of NOK 8 /euro, resulting in 320,0 00 NOK. We assumed that 60% of these costs would represent productivity costs due to late ab ortion, i.e. 192,000 NOK, and 40% health costs of different treatments th rough life, i.e. 128,000 NOK. 119 Appendix 5. Health related quality-of-life (HRQL) data The HRQoL-data for precancerous lesions and genital warts The HRQoL data for CIN 2+ came from a study, Galante (77), that compared the HRQoL-weights for pneumococcal and HPV- related diseases for different EQ-5D tariffs. Seventy-three non-patient study pa rticipants valued HPV-related health states using vignettes. The vignette description of the CIN 2+ health state included the screening procedures, the conization procedure and possible complications for future pregnancies. Values obtained through valuation of vignettes do not necessarily give a good approx imation of how it is to live with the condition from a patient perspective (78). Because Galante did not report the HRQoL of a reference population, we used age-ma tched baseline data as a proxy (55). Despite these limitations, we accepted the use of the data because we did not identify any other EQ-5D data for CIN 2+ in our literature search. The HRQoL data for VIN 2+ came from a mu lticenter, observational, cross sectional study of 42 patients with a confirmed di agnosis of VIN (79). The study found that women with VIN 2+ had a lower mean EQ-5D value than the age-matched UK general population. Because we did not have any HRQoL-data for VaIN, we used the data for VIN as a proxy for the HR QoL-loss associated with VaIN. The CIN 2+ vignettes included a description of the conization procedure, and the QALY-losses due to CIN2+ can therefore be argued to include the impact of conization. The HRQoL-loss a ssociated with ablative treatment or surgical excision of high-grade VIN lesions ma y however not be included in those estimates, because the patients asked were not necessarily un der treatment for their condition. Those estimates may as a result be an underestimate of the actual QALY-loss. At the same time, respondents perceptions about the futu re with regards to fear of cancer and associated symptoms and treatments can bias the results in the opposite direction. A direct comparison of the CIN 2+ and VIN/Va IN values is however difficult, since the former study derived EQ-5D values from non- patients with vignettes, and the latter study reported values from actual patients. The HRQoL data for genital warts came from two studies. Woodhall (56) was a questionnaire based study of 895 patients aged 16 or over with a current diagnosis of genital warts, attending eight sexual cl inics in England and Northern Ireland. Dominiak-Felden (79) reported EQ-5D values derived from 186 patients with genital warts that attended specific health cent ers across the UK. The data reported for younger adults (18-34 year olds) suggested a significant loss of HRQoL. Both studies included new and recurrent episodes of genital warts, and both studies compared the patients EQ-5D values with age- and sex matched general UK population values. 120 Table 52. Inputs and results of the QALY-c alculations for the precancerous outcomes and genital warts Outcome Health state HRQoL- value Reference population HRQoL Duration of episode Value of k Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN 2+) HRQoL-data cervical cancer, vu lvar cancer, vaginal cancer and anal cancer We used data from the aforementioned study by Galante and colleagues for the cervical cancer treatment, post-treatment and long-term post-cancer phase. The same limitations concerning the sample si ze and elicitation method apply here. The vignette for cervical cancer included a description of the most likely treatment options, possible complications following tr eatment (including the ability to have children), as well as the possibility of recurrence. For survivors the descriptions included the possibility for sexual proble ms, screening activities and the risk of recurrence. After controlling for background variables, Korfage (81) found that the cervical cancer survivors (n=291) reported EQ-5D values that were not significantly different from the reference population (n=349) wi thout history of disease. Lang (82) reported HRQoL values for 454 \"disease free\" cervical cancer patients that were 121 comparable to our age-matched baseline data (55). Consequently, the data from both studies suggest that the patients di d not experience a HRQoL-loss as measured with the EQ-5D. The values for the post-treatment and long-term post-cancer phase in Table 53 are the arithmetic mean across the three studies Galante, Lang and Korfage. As in the previous report (30), we divided the cancer health states into two different phases, each contributing to the total QALY-loss: 1. 0-3 years: The short-term phase: Treatment and post-treatment. 2. 3 years and up to patient's death: The long term post-cancer phase. We assumed an average treatment phase that lasted for 4 months, followed by a post-treatment phase that lasted for 2 ye ars and 8 months. As before, we assumed a loss of HRQoL, but no excess mortality when in treatment and post-treatment in the short-term phase. In year three, we split the population into survivors and deceased according to the 5- year relative survival data from the Cancer Registry of Norway (CRN) (10). Survival according to disease stage (local, regional, distant) were complete only for cervical cancer. In order to be able to complete the QALY-calculations, we assumed that the cancer survival rate would be equal to the survival rate for the respective cervical cancer stage, after adjustin g for differences in total survival between the relevant cancer and cervical cancer. In other words, we multiplied the survival rate for the respective cervical cancer stage with the rati o of total survival of the relevant cancer to the total survival of cervical cancer. For those patients who die at year three, we calculated the quality-adjusted life expectancy lost (QALE). In the long-term post-cancer phase, we assumed a life-long HRQoL-loss for the proportion who survived, based on our fi ndings in the literature. Assuming, as we do, that all patients surviv e until year three and that thereafter the survivors experience the same mortality rate s as the rest of the population may be considered conservative. Finally, in the calculations of life-years lost, each life year lost is assigned a value of one and the HRQoL-loss associated with tr eatment or the post-treatment phases are not included. The net effect of those fact ors contribute to comparable results for QALY-losses and life-years lost. 122 Table 53.

The excess mortality associated with a premature birth before week 32 and 30 have been estimated by others to be approximately 1.35 and 2.16 QALYs (83). Th is potential for excess mortality was not included in our estimate of the potent ial QALY-loss associated with premature births. The literature search The tables below describes the narrow sear ches for CIN, VIN, VaIN, PIN, AIN, cervical cancer, vulvar cancer, vaginal cancer, penile cancer, anal cancer, oropharyngeal cancer, genital warts, co nization and serious adverse events. The search included more outcomes than we in cluded in the main analysis, because we a priori did not know which outcomes we wo uld find effect data for and therefore include in the analysis.

Estimation of the vaccine expenditures associated with the implementation HPV-vaccination of boys aged 12 We assumed in our analysis that the me an coverage rate for the first vaccine dose among boys would be the same as among girls, 82%. Furthermore, we assumed that 84.5% of those boys receivin g at least one dose also would receive two and 69% all three (see Table 43). Based on these assumptions we calculated that 69.3% (=84.5%*82%) of every boy cohort would receive two doses, wh ile 56.6% (=69%*82%) would receive all three doses. Given an estimated population size of 31,000 boys per cohort, this would mean that approximately 121,000 additional doses will be required every year to implement HPV-vaccination of boys. Table 70.
