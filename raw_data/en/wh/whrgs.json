You might be wondering why and when a colon cleanse is necessary. People normally get colon cleanses before a medical procedure, like a colonoscopy. But there is a growing belief that the process of cleansing your colon can rid your insides of excess toxins that have built up over time. Many people feel that a colon cleanse can serve as a reset for their insides. Some people will resort to [colonic hydrotherapy](https://hellotushy.com/blogs/healthy-poop/what-is-colon-hydrotherapy) or colonic irrigation. During colonic hydrotherapy, large amounts of water and sometimes herbs or even coffee, are flushed through the colon using a tube that's inserted into the rectum. Many of us at Team TUSHY have done it. Verdict? Done it. It feels wild. What Does a Natural Colon Cleanse Do? A DIY colon cleanse removes harmful toxins from your gastrointestinal tract that build up over time - from the comfort of your own home. These toxins can cause health problems such as arthritis, high blood pressure, poor liver function and more. Many people believe that colon cleansing improves health by removing toxins, boosting your energy and enhancing your immune system. If a full-blown irrigation system cycled through your rectum is not appetizing to you, there are plenty of home remedy colon cleanses out there that aren't as invasive... or expensive. 9 Natural Home Remedy Colon Cleanses 1. Drink Water It's that simple. Water is one of the healthiest, easiest and safest diy colon cleanses. Water moistens stool and gives it bulk, facilitating its passage through the colon. If you are experiencing dehydration, you will have fewer bowel movements because your body is trying to keep water. It will reabsorb water from your bowels, resulting in the stool becoming dry, hard, and very hard to pass. Everyone's daily hydration needs are different, but it is vital to drink plenty of water throughout the day. 2. Sea Salt and Water A salt water flush is also a known home colon cleanse remedy. It is highly recommended for people experiencing constipation and irregularity. Studies have shown that saltwater, when paired with yoga, can clear the colon. Before eating in the morning, mix 2 teaspoons of salt with lukewarm water. Sea salt or Himalayan salt is recommended. Quickly down a glass of water on an empty stomach, and in a few minutes, you'll probably feel an urge to go to the bathroom. Do this twice daily, once in the morning and once before bed. It's recommended that during the cleanse, you stay home near your toilet because... it will flush you out. 3. Apple Cider Vinegar Apple cider vinegar helps flush out waste from our body while keeping the useful bacteria intact. You can take it with honey to mask the taste while simultaneously cleansing your colon and [restoring the digestive system](https://hellotushy.com/blogs/healthy-poop/homemade-digestive-detox). Mix 2 tablespoons of raw apple cider vinegar and honey. Mix it in one cup of water and drink it once daily. Bonus benefits of apple cider vinegar include preventing diabetes and lowering bad cholesterol. 4. Fruit and Vegetable Juice Raw fruit and vegetable juices contain many elements that may help clean your colon out. Fruits and veggies that are rich in fiber, phytochemicals, and natural sugars are beneficial to getting things moving. Fructose can act as a sort of laxative that promotes digestion and stool flow. Here are a list of fruits that are perfect for a homemade colon cleanse: - Apples - Prunes - Pears - Bananas - Kiwis - Grapes - Plums - Persimmons - Lemons Some natural colon cleanse plans recommend [consuming only liquids](https://hellotushy.com/blogs/healthy-poop/colon-cleanse-drink-recipes) for a few days at a time to help [cleanse your colon](https://hellotushy.com/blogs/sex-and-wellness/overnight-colon-cleanse) and digestive tract. It is best to consume fruit and vegetable juices in the form of smoothies to keep all the fiber, water, and nutrients intact. 5. Resistant Starches Resistant starches are sugars that are harder for the body to break down and help bulk the stool. These starches remain mostly undigested and become bulk in the stool. The more bulk there is in the stool, the sooner the bowel is stimulated into action, possibly helping cleanse the colon. Foods high in resistant starches include: - Potatoes - Sweet Potatoes - Yams - Sugar Beets - Sugar Cane - Sweet Corn - Green Bananas - Vegetable Stems, Tubers, and Roots - Rice - Buckwheat and Millet - Al Dente Pasta - White Bread - Cornflakes - Muesli 6. Probiotics Probiotics introduce good bacteria to the gut with the help of fiber and resistant starches. These curb inflammation and promote regularity. Adding probiotics to the diet is another way to cleanse your colon. This also boosts overall health in many other ways. You can get more probiotics by taking probiotic supplements. Also, eat lots of probiotic-rich foods, like yogurt, kimchi, pickles, and other fermented foods. 7. Herbal Teas Trying some herbal teas may assist digestive health via the colon. Laxative herbs like psyllium, aloe vera, marshmallow root, and slippery elm may help with constipation. Make sure to talk to your doctor and follow directions closely before using these herbs. Also, use them sparingly; otherwise, they can be harmful. Other herbs like ginger, garlic, and cayenne pepper contain antimicrobial phytochemicals. These are thought to suppress bad bacteria. For this reason, they're included in lots of cleanses, though studies are needed. Try a cup of one of these herbal teas up to three times a day. Only drink tea once per day for laxative herbal teas. 8. Fermented Foods Fermented foods often contain high levels of probiotics, which are beneficial bacteria that contribute to gut health. These bacteria help the bowels move stool out of the colon regularly and reduce the risk of gas, bloating, constipation, and infection. Common fermented foods that contain probiotics include: - Greek Yogurt - Apple Cider Vinegar - Kefir - Skyr - Kimchi - Sauerkraut - Pickles - Miso - Tempeh - Kombucha - Beer - Cider Research suggests that probiotics may help prevent and possibly treat colon cancer, but researchers agree that more studies are necessary to understand these effects. A healthy gut biome offers numerous other benefits for overall health and immune function. 9. Eating Fiber-Rich Foods Fiber adds bulk to stool, which reduces the time it spends sitting in the colon and increases the number of bowel movements that a person has. Many natural, whole foods are rich in fiber, including: - Nuts - Beans - Seeds - Berries - Whole Grains - Cereals People who find it difficult to get enough fiber through their diet can try taking fiber supplements like Metamucil (psyllium). Health professionals recommend 25 to 35 milligrams of fiber a day for a healthy digestive system. Potential Benefits of Colon Cleanses At this point, there are no proven benefits of colon cleansing. However, people who practice and promote DIY colon cleanses claim to have experienced immense health benefits. Some say that they lead to increased energy, improved liver functions and reducing the risk of colon cancer to name a few. Many of these claims can be due in part to the natural cleanses. Research has shown that digesting resistant starches produces compounds that help prevent colon cancer, improve macronutrient regulation, prevent or control diabetes, and prevent or control obesity. Potential Risks of Colon Cleanses Some of the potential risks of colon cleansing include: - Weakness - Irritability - Electrolyte imbalance and dehydration - Vomiting and nausea - Abdominal cramps - Dizziness and fainting - Loss of healthful gut microflora and increased risk of infection - Diarrhea - Bowel ulcerations - Bowel infection - Kidney damage and failure People with preexisting bowel conditions like IBS or Crohn's Disease should avoid colon cleansing methods unless prescribed by a doctor. Bowel cleansing methods, especially aggressive ones, can cause a flare-up of symptoms in people with specific conditions. Most health professionals urge against juice and colon cleanse drinks. Raw fruit juices can contain compounds that are hard on the kidneys and liver. Without any treatment to kill harmful bacteria and viruses, these juices can also make people ill. They may pose significant dangers for those with medical conditions, such as diabetes. The FDA has taken legal action against companies who were using unproven medical claims to promote cleanse products, stating that they could reduce the risk of cancer or treat serious medical conditions. People with diabetes and other metabolic conditions should also avoid detoxes or extreme diets and instead follow a healthful, doctor-recommended diet. Severely restricting calorie intake, which is often part of DIY colon cleanses, can also be damaging to a person's overall health. It rarely contributes to long-term weight loss or well-being.
