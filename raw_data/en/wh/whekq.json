Here are the Top 10 Immunity-Boosting, Real Food Ingredients (great to infuse in snack foods like protein bars): 1. Green tea Compared to black tea, green tea is a more powerful immunity-boosting ingredient due to its high levels of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG).

Furthermore, green tea is a good source for L-theanine, an amino acid that helps produce germ-fighting compounds in our cells. Green tea is a real food ingredient that carries antiviral and antibacterial properties. As such, food entrepreneurs using green tea in their protein bars will capture the attention of many health-conscious consumers. 2. Turmeric A part of the ginger family, turmeric is a well-known anti-inflammatory and \"superfood\". Turmeric is a popular immunity-boosting ingredient as it contains curcumin, which provides powerful anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Similar to green tea, it also carries anti-3CL substances that strengthen the immune system's response to harmful viral bodies. In addition to being an immune-booster, turmeric is one of the Top 5 Protein Bar Friendly Adaptogens. As such, it is an ingredient that food entrepreneurs should consider sourcing when creating their protein bars. 3. Ginger Like turmeric, ginger has anti-inflammatory and immune-boosting properties.

Citrus fruits As we all know, citrus fruits\u2014such as grapefruits, oranges, lemons, and limes\u2014are an excellent source of Vitamin C.

Almonds Almonds contain lots of healthy fats, fiber, protein, and magnesium. They are particularly rich in vitamin E, a key nutrient that acts as an antioxidant in the body and strengthens the immune system from any infections or diseases.

Entrepreneurs should turn their attention to sourcing these almonds organically to distinguish their products from other protein bars. 6. Sunflower seeds Sunflower seeds are nutritious, packed with nutrients like magnesium, vitamin B-6, and vitamin E that help strengthen our bodies. They also contain the micronutrient selenium, which helps the body and immune system control cell damage. Another common protein bar ingredient, food entrepreneurs should continue to use sunflower seeds to remain competitive with other brands. 7. Bone broth Bone broth is extremely nutrient-rich. It has many essential minerals, like calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus, that help flush out toxins and reduce inflammation. Its amino acids also seal any openings in the gut, improving the body's gut health. As a result, bone broth is highly beneficial to the immune system. Bone broth is low in calories and high in protein. Entrepreneurs interested in keto protein bars should find ways to incorporate bone broth since it helps the body efficiently convert fat into energy. 8. Kale Kale is an immune-boosting superfood with high levels of vitamin C, which helps the body fight off infections. Kale also contains beta carotene, selenium, iron, as well as folate, an immune booster known for its ability to aid in the production of red and white blood cells in the bone marrow.

Mushrooms As one of nature's healthiest foods, mushrooms are rich in essential nutrients and minerals. These include selenium, B vitamins (riboflavin and niacin), and zinc, which are necessary for the immune system to work optimally. Zinc is especially important because, like vitamin C, it aids in the production of white blood cells to help the body fight off diseases and infections. Another one of the Top 5 Protein Bar Friendly Adaptogens, mushrooms are a nutrient-dense plant protein ingredient, perfect for flexitarian-focused protein bar entrepreneurs. 10. Honey Although low in vitamins and minerals, honey is dense in many important antioxidants, like flavonoids.
