The vaccine plays an increasingly important role in disease prevention. In recent years, the safety of vaccines is a matter of concern. Perform the identity test on every lot of the vaccine. The vaccine lot passes the identification test if it protects susceptible against infection with various virus. Creative Biolabs is a world leader in the field of vaccine analytical development. With our extensive experience and advanced platform, we are therefore confident in offering the best development services for the identity test of vaccines. We guarantee the finest results for our customers all over the world. The Vaccine Identity Tests Route Since the vaccine is used in a large number of healthy persons, the adverse reaction after vaccination should be lower than the drug normally used for treatment. The identity tests for vaccines should be high standard. In order to ensure the safety of the vaccine used to detect from the following several aspects: - Detection of attenuation degree. The attenuation degree of attenuated live vaccine should be considered first. Generally, the nature virus strain is artificially modified, so as to obtain non-pathogenic and immunogenic strains. - The reliability of inactivation. An important identity tests requirement for inactivated vaccines should be the inactivated level. Most of the inactivation methods are chemical inactivation agents, such as methanol. - The allergen detection: it is very important to check for allergens in vaccines. According to the current methods, the vaccines are not purified virus, which has other antigenic substances in the process of cell culture. The Development of Vaccine Identity Tests Platforms The modern high-throughput technologies, such as chip and second-generation sequencing, provide new ideas for evaluating vaccine effectiveness. The bio-chip, high-throughput sequencer and other instruments used in this process are all emerging high-tech materials equipment in the field of the vaccine identity tests, which plays a huge role in the field of life science and biological preparations. Our Strategies of Identity Tests Our vaccine identity tests technology for traditional and new vaccines are developed by the combination of related technologies of various disciplines. Up to now, no single technology can be used to undertake the whole process of identity tests. Creative Biolabs innovative detection system is often composed of several new technologies and the advantages of the original technology. A wide variety of fully integrated biosafety testing programs are used in vaccine identity tests. - The rapid and accurate detection process - The high cost performance - The authoritative certification report Creative Biolabs is a leader in the field of vaccine development and has focused on the vaccines analytical development and qualification services for years. We have experienced experts and advanced platforms that are able to provide excellent services. If you are interested in our services, please contact us for more details.
