KPMG LLP Suite 400300 North Greene StreetGreensboro, NC 27401Independent Auditors' Report The Board of Trustees Wake Forest University: Report on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Wake Forest University (the University), which comprise the consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2019, and the related consolidated statements of activities, and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements. Management's Responsibility for the Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles; this includes the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. Auditors' Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards , issued by the Comptroller General of the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditors' judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity's preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An a udit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Opinion In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Wake Forest University as of June 30, 2019, and the changes in its net assets and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 2 Emphasis of Matter As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the University adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016- 14, Not-for-Profit Entities (Topic 958): Presentation of Financial Statements of Not-for-Profit Entities; ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers; and ASU 2018-08, Not-for-Profit Entities, Clarifying the Scope and Accounting Guidance for Contributions Received and Contributions Made, during the year ended June 30, 2019. Our opinion is not modified with respect to these matters. Other Matter Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the consolidated financial statements as a whole. The supplementary information included in the consolidated balance sheet, statement of activities, statement of cash flows, and the accompanying notes related to the College of Arts and Sciences, Schools of Law, Business, and Divinity, and Reynolda House, Inc. (collectively, Reynolda Campus); and Wake Forest University Health Sciences (WFUHS) is presented for purposes of additional analysis and is not a required part of the consolidated financial statements. Such information is the responsibility of management and was derived from and relates directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. The information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the consolidated financial statements and certain additional procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the consolidated financial statements or to the consolidated financial statements themselves, and other additional procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. In our opinion, the supplementary information is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated financial statements as a whole. Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards In accordance with Government Auditing Standards , we have also issued our report dated October 21, 2019 on our consideration of Wake Forest University' s internal control over financial reporting and on our tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements and other matters. The purpose of that report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over financial reporting and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of Wake Forest University 's internal control over financial reporting or on compliance. That report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering Wake Forest University 's internal control over financial reporting and compliance.

to Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2019 (Dollars in thousands) 8 (Continued) (1) Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (a) Description of Wake Forest University Wake Forest University (the University) is a private, coeducational, not-for-profit institution of higher education and research located in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. The consolidated financial statements of the University include the Reynolda Campus and Wake Forest University Health Sciences (WFUHS), and all entities over which the University has control, including all of the subsidiaries of Reynolda Campus and WFUHS. Reynolda Campus - includes the College of Arts and Sciences, Schools of Law, Business, and Divinity, and consolidating subsidiaries including: Verger Capital Management, LLC (VCM), and Reynolda House, Inc. (collectively, Reynolda Campus). WFUHS - a wholly owned affiliate of the University, is a private coeducational, not for profit institution of higher education and research dedicated to medical and health education, healthcare, and biomedical research. Its wholly owned affiliates are the Dialysis Centers of Wake Forest University, Wake Forest Innovation Quarter Development Co., Wake Forest Innovation Quarter CDC, Wake Forest Innovation Quarter Management Co., WFIQ Holdings, LLC, WFIQ Holdings II, LLC, WFIQ Holdings III, LLC, Seed Stage Associates, LLC, Park IMP 1, LLC, BRF - A1, LLC, BRF Deck 1, LLC, BRF - A1a, LLC, Childress Institute for Pediatric Trauma, Wake Forest Emergency Providers, North District Owners Association, and RegenMed Development Organization. Effective July 1, 2010, the Boards of WFUHS, North Carolina Baptist Hospital (NCBH), Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center (WFUBMC) and the University approved the Medical Center Integration Agreement (the Integration Agreement or MCIA). The Integration Agreement allows for the leveraging of the combined resources of WFUHS and NCBH to fulfill a single mission, improve health and optimize performance of the combined organizations, while balancing patient care, education and research. The University and NCBH are the members of WFUBMC. The Integration Agreement created an integrated academic medical center that combines clinical care, education and research under a single management and debt structure referred to as Wake Forest Baptist (WFB), which is governed by WFUBMC. One of the nation 's preeminent academic medical centers, WFB is an integrated healthcare system that operates over 50 subsidiaries. It provides a continuum of care that includes primary care centers, outpatient rehabilitation, and dialysis centers. To ensure alignment across the organization, WFUHS and NCBH unrestricted operating income (deficit) are shared equally between the entities. Although the entities will be operated to maximize the value at the total WFB level, revenues, expenses, existing and new assets and debt will continue to be accounted for generally at the individual entity levels. The WFUBMC Board is comprised of seven directors elected by NCBH from among its Board members, seven directors elected by the University 's Board of Trustees and two nonvoting directors elected by the WFUBMC Board from among the faculty of WFUHS. Subject to the reserved powers of the members, WFB operates WFUHS (including all subsidiaries and affiliates) and NCBH (including all subsidiaries and affiliates), including day- to-day management, strategic direction, managed care contracting and other business activities conferred on WFUBMC. WAKE FOREST UNIVERSI TY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2019 (Dollars in thousands) 9 (Continued) All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. (b)Recent Accounting Standards Adopted In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-14, Not-for-Profit Entities (Topic 958). This ASU changes certain presentation requirements for not-for-profit entities ' financial statements in an effort to make information more meaningful for users. ASU 2016-14 reduces the number of net asset classifications from three to two: net assets without donor restrictions, and net assets with donor restrictions. Additionally, the ASU requires expenses to be presented by their natural and functional classifications. The guidance also requires that investment returns be presented net of external and direct internal investment expenses and eliminates the requirements for disclosures of the components of investment returns. Further, the ASU requires additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures about liquidity and availability of financial assets. The University adopted ASU 2016-14 on July 1, 2018 and has adjusted the presentation of the financial statements accordingly. The ASU has been applied retrospectively to all periods presented. The reclassification of net assets driven by the adoption of ASU 2016-04 as of June 30, 2018 is as follows: Without Donor Restrictions With Donor Restrictions Total Reynolda Reynolda Reynolda Campus WFUHS Campus $ 653,840 560,020 \u2014 \u2014 763,351 233,557 1,422,672 794,745 In May 2014, FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. The core principle of the revenue model is that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The University adopted ASU 2014-09 on July 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method approach. Periods prior to adoption have been revised to conform to net presentation of a single net patient service revenue total. The University performed an analysis of revenue streams and transactions under ASU 2014-09, including applying the portfolio approach as a practical expedient to group contracts with similar characteristics, WAKE FOREST UNIVERSI TY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2019 (Dollars in thousands) 10 (Continued) such that revenue for a given portfolio would not be materially different than if it were evaluated on a contract- by-contract basis. Upon adoption, the majority of what was previously classified as provision for bad debts and presented as a reduction to net patient service revenue on the consolidated statements of activities is treated as an implicit price concession that reduces the transaction price, which is reported as patient revenue. The University elected the practical expedient allowed under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606- 10-32-18 and does not adjust the promised amount of consideration from patients and third party payers for the effects of a significant financing component due to the expectation that the period between the time of the service and the time the service is paid will be one year or less. The impact of any extended payment agreements with patients is not deemed material. The impact of adopting ASU 2014-09 was not material to total revenues without donor restrictions, excess of revenues and gains over expenses and losses, or total net assets. The University 's revenue recognition policies are detailed within Note 1(s). In June 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-08, Not-for-Profit Entities (Topic 958): Clarifying the Scope and the Accounting Guidance for Contributions Received and Contributions Made . This ASU clarifies and improves the scope and accounting guidance for contributions received and made and assists entities in evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as contributions within the scope of Topic 958, Not-for-Profit Entities, or as exchange transactions subject to other guidance, and in determining whether a contribution is conditional. ASU 2018-08 is effective for fiscal year 2019. Not Yet Adopted In February 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) . This ASU requires the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under previous GAAP, which have terms of greater than 12 months. This ASU defines a lease as a contract, or part of a contract, that conveys the right to control the use of identified property, plant, or equipment (an identified asset) for a period of time in exchange for consideration. This ASU retains a distinction between finance leases and operating leases. The result of retaining a distinction between finance leases and operating leases in the statement of activities and the statement of cash flows is largely unchanged from previous GAAP. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal year 2020. The University expects to record an increase in lease assets and lease liabilities presented in the consolidated balance sheets. (c) Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the accrual basis in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Net assets are reported based on the existence or absence of donor-imposed restrictions and serve as the foundation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, net assets of the University and changes therein are classified and reported as follows: Net Assets without donor restriction s - Net assets that are not subject to donor-imposed restrictions and may be expended for any purpose in performing the primary objectives of the organization.WAKE FOREST UNIVERSI TY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2019 (Dollars in thousands) 11 (Continued) Net Assets with donor restrictions - Net assets subject to donor-imposed stipulations. Some donor restrictions are temporary in nature; those restrictions will be met by actions of the University and/or by the passage of time. Other donor restrictions are perpetual in nature, where by the donor has stipulated the funds be maintained in perpetuity; generally, the donors of these assets permit the University to use all or part of the income earned on related investments for general or specific purposes. Revenues are reported as increases in net assets without donor restrictions unless their use is limited by donor-imposed restrictions. Donor-restricted contributions are reported as increases in net assets with donor restrictions. Contributions which impose restrictions that are met in the same fiscal year they are received are reported as increases in net assets without donor restrictions. Expenses are reported as decreases in net assets without donor restrictions. Gains and losses on investments and other assets or liabilities are reported as increases or decreases, respectively, in net assets without donor restrictions unless their use is restricted by explicit donor stipulations or by law. Expirations of restrictions on net assets (i.e., the donor-stipulated purpose has been fulfilled and/or the stipulated time period has elapsed) are reported as reclassifications from net assets with donor restrictions to net assets without donor restrictions in the consolidated statements of operations and changes in net assets. For gifts of long-lived assets, these releases of restrictions are treated as nonoperating. (d)Operating Excess (Deficit) Revenues earned, expenses incurred, and returns made available for the University 's operating purposes of teaching, research, patient care, and other programs and services are components of the operating excess or deficit presented in the consolidated statement of activities. The University considers the following items to be nonoperating activities: restricted contributions for capital and long-term investment and the related net assets released from restriction, investment return in excess of amounts designated for current operations, actuarial gain or loss on annuity obligations, unrealized gain or loss on interest rate swaps, postretirement related changes other than service cost, gain or loss from affiliates (equity method), donor designation changes and other, net, including costs incurred related to a cloud computing arrangement. (e) Fair Value Measurements The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to measurements involving significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows: Level 1 - Valuations for assets and liabilities traded in active exchange markets as of the reporting date. Valuations are obtained from readily available pricing sources for market transactions involving identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 - Valuations for assets and liabilities are determined through direct or indirect observations other than quoted market prices. WAKE FOREST UNIVERSI TY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2019 (Dollars in thousands) 12 (Continued) Level 3 - Valuations for assets and liabilities that are derived from other valuation methodologies including discounted cash flow models and similar techniques, and not based on market exchange, dealer or broker traded transactions. Net asset value (NAV) - Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient have not been categorized in the fair value hierarchy. In the event that changes in the inputs used in the fair value measurement of an asset or liability result in a transfer of the fair value measurement to a different categorization (e.g., from Level 3 to Level 2), such transfers between fair value categories are recognized at the end of the reporting period. The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents (Level 1), patient receivables (Level 2), and accounts receivable (Level 2) approximate fair value because of the terms and relatively short maturity of these financial instruments. The carrying amounts of contributions receivable represent the present value of estimated future cash flows, which approximates fair value (Level 3). Investments (Levels 1-3, see note 8) and deposits with bond trustee (Level 1) are reported at fair value. The fair value of notes receivable from students under government loan programs cannot be made because such loans are not sellable and can only be assigned to the U.S. government or its designees. The fair value of receivables from students under University loan programs (Level 2) approximates carrying value. The carrying amounts of accounts payable and other accruals (Level 2) approximate fair value because of the relatively short maturity of these financial instruments. Annuities payable (Level 2) are recorded at fair value using a single discount rate equivalent to the University 's tax-exempt borrowing rate. The carrying amounts of notes and bonds payable (Level 2) with variable interest rates approximate their fair value because substantially all of these financial instruments bear interest at rates that approximate current market rates for borrowings with similar maturities and credit quality. (f)Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with original maturities at date of purchase of three months or less. Such assets, reported at fair value, primarily consist of depository account balances, and money market funds. The University maintains bank accounts at various financial institutions covered by the Federal Depository Insurance Corporation (FDIC). At various times throughout the year, the University may maintain bank accounts in excess of the FDIC-insured limit. Management believes that the risk associated with these bank accounts is minimal. (g)Contributions Receivable Pledges that represent unconditional promises to give are recognized at fair value as contributions with donor restrictions in the period such promises are made by donors. Pledges are recorded after discounting, using rates ranging from 1. 46%-3.88% in order to derive the present value of the future cash flows. An allowance for uncollectible contributions receivable is provided based upon management 's judgment, considering such factors as prior collection history, type of contribution, relationship with donor, and nature of fund-raising activity.WAKE FOREST UNIVERSI TY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2019 (Dollars in thousands) 13 (Continued) (h)Notes Receivable Notes receivable, which are recorded at face value, principally represent amounts due from students under Perkins and other U.S. government sponsored loan programs. A general allowance is made for uncollectible student loans after considering long-term collection experience and current trends. Other notes receivable are evaluated individually for impairment, with allowances based on management 's expectations given facts and circumstances related to each note. (i) Investments The University 's Board of Trustees created an asset management company, VCM, that provides research, advice, counsel and management with respect to the University 's primary investment portfolio. VCM manages the investment funds of Verger Capital Fund, LLC (Master Fund), Verger Fund I, LLC (Verger Fund I), and Verger Fund II, LLC (Verger Fund II). The Master Fund is controlled by the University and provides investment services for Verger Fund I and Verger Fund II. Verger Fund I was created to hold the Reynolda Campus long-term endowment pool and Verger Fund II was created to hold the WFUHS and Reynolda House long-term endowment pools. Certain investments, however, are held in specific instruments outside of VCM to comply with donor restrictions or other considerations. Valuation - Investments are recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheet. Investments in readily marketable debt and equity securities are stated at their fair values, which are determined based on quoted market prices. For shares in mutual funds, the University considers fair value based on share prices reported by the funds as of the last business day of the fiscal year. Investments in private equity and absolute return funds are generally reported at the net asset value (NAV) reported by fund managers and these values are reviewed and evaluated by the University 's investment management company. Unless it is probable that all or a portion of the investment will be sold for an amount other than NAV, the University has concluded, as a practical expedient, that the NAV approximates fair value. Additionally, the University 's interest in both Verger Fund I and Verger Fund II are included at NAV in investments on the consolidated balance sheet. Investments in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method. Risks - Investments are exposed to several risks, including interest rate, currency, market and credit risks. Due to the level of risk associated with certain investments, it is at least possible that changes in the values of the investments will occur in the near term and that such changes could materially affect the amounts reported in the University' s consolidated financial statements. Reporting - Investment transactions are accounted for on a trade date basis. Short and Intermediate term investment income is reported as investment return included in operating revenues and realized and unrealized gains (losses) are reported as nonoperating revenues. Long-term investment spending rate distribution (see Note 8) is reported as operating revenues and any excess (deficit) of income and realized and unrealized gains (losses) earned on investments above (below) spending rate, including split-interest agreements are reported as nonoperating revenues. Investment management fees are netted against investment return. WAKE FOREST UNIVERSI TY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2019 (Dollars in thousands) 14 (Continued) (j) Investments in Real Estate Investments in real estate are primarily comprised of rental properties of the University and are valued at the lower of net book value or market. The University records depreciation on rental properties over 40 years. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method. Real estate gifts held for sale are recorded at fair value, based on periodic external appraisals. (k) Interests in Perpetual Trusts Held by Others and Split-Interest Agreements The University 's split-interest agreements with donors consist primarily of irrevocable charitable remainder trusts for which the University serves as trustee and charitable gift annuities. Assets held in these trusts are stated at fair value and are included in investments. Contribution revenue is recognized at the dates the trusts are established. The University recognizes the change in value of split-interest agreements according to the fair value of assets that are associated with each trust and recalculates the liability for the present value of annuity obligations. Any change in fair value is recognized in the consolidated statement of activities. The University is also the beneficiary of certain trusts and other assets held and administered by others . The University 's share of these assets is recognized in investments at fair value. (l) Other Assets Other assets are primarily comprised of prepaid expenses, deferred expenses, and inventories. Inventories are valued at the lower of average cost or net realizable value. (m) Land, Buildings, and Equipment Land, buildings, and equipment are recorded at cost at date of acquisition or estimated fair value on the date received for donated items. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of each class or component of depreciable asset. Estimated lives range from 3 to 60 years. Depreciation is not calculated on land and construction in progress. Gains or losses on the disposal of land, buildings, and equipment are included in the consolidated statement of activities. Interest cost incurred on borrowed funds during the period of construction of capital assets is capitalized as a component of the cost of constructing these assets. (n)Impairment of Long-Lived Assets The University periodically assesses the realizability of its long-lived assets and evaluates such assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. For assets to be held, impairment is determined to exist if estimated future cash flows, undiscounted and without interest charges, are less than the carrying amount. The University recognizes an impairment charge when the fair value of the asset or group of assets is less than the carrying value. (o)Asset Retirement Obligations The University has asset retirement obligations (AROs) arising from regulatory requirements to perform certain asset retirement activities at the time that certain buildings and equipment are disposed of or renovated. The liability was initially measured at fair value and subsequently is adjusted for accretionWAKE FOREST UNIVERSI TY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2019 (Dollars in thousands) 15 (Continued) expense and changes in the amount or timing of the estimated cash flows. The corresponding asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset 's useful life. The University revalues asset retirement obligations as remediation costs are incurred or as additional cost information becomes available. (p)Derivative Instruments The University holds certain interest rate swap agreements to manage the fixed/variable mix of its debt portfolio. The notional amounts of the agreements dictate the payments between the counterparties based on agreed-upon rates as determined in the agreements. The University records all derivative instruments on the consolidated balance sheet at their respective fair values. All changes in fair value are reflected in the consolidated statement of activities. Cash payments and receipts are included in interest on debt. (q)Postretirement Plans The University records annual amounts relating to its postretirement plans based on calculations that incorporate various actuarial and other assumptions including discount rates, mortality, assumed rates of return, turnover rates, and healthcare cost trend rates. The University reviews its assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is appropriate to do so. The effect of modifications to those assumptions is recorded as a change in unrestricted net assets and amortized to net periodic benefit cost over future periods using the corridor method. The University believes that the assumptions utilized in recording its obligations under its plans are reasonable based on its experience and market conditions. The net periodic benefit costs are recognized as employees render the services necessary to earn the postretirement benefits. The University records the service cost component of net benefit cost in the employee benefits expense line item and all other costs associated with net benefit costs are reflected in nonoperating expense. (r) Government Grants Refundable Funds provided by the U.S. government under the Federal Perkins Loan Program are loaned to qualified students and may be reloaned after collections. These funds are ultimately refundable to the U.S. government and are reported as liabilities. (s) Revenue Recognition The University recognizes revenue based on either ASU 2014-09 ( Topic 606 ) or ASU 2018- 08 (Topic 958) as appropriate based on the underlying transactions within each revenue category. The University 's significant revenue recognition polices are as follows: Student tuition and fees - Student tuition and fees for instruction and other educational services, net of scholarships and fellowships, are substantially billed and collected prior to the end of each semester. Revenues are earned and recognized over the course of each semester as education services are delivered. Student tuition and fees received in advance of services to be rendered are recorded as deferred revenue. Student aid provided by the University is reflected as a reduction in student tuition and fee revenue up to the cost of attendance. Student financial aid in excess of the WAKE FOREST UNIVERSI TY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2019 (Dollars in thousands) 16 (Continued) cost of attendance is reflected as a reduction in auxiliary revenue. Student aid does not include payments made to students for services rendered to the University. Grants and contracts - Grants for basic research and other sponsored programs are generally subject to restrictions and conditions that must be met before the University is entitled to funding. Accordingly, advances from granting agencies are generally considered refundable in the unlikely event specified services are not performed. The University recognizes revenues on grants for basic research and other sponsored programs as the awards for such programs are expended, since expenditure in accordance with award terms typically results in the simultaneous release of restrictions and conditions imposed by the grantor. Revenue from exchange contracts for applied research is recognized as the University 's contractual performance obligations are substantially met. Indirect cost recovery by the University on U.S. government grants and contracts is based upon a predetermined negotiated rate and is recorded as grants and contracts revenue. Contributions - Contributions, including unconditional promises to give, are recognized in the period the contributions or promise is made. Contributions of assets other than cash are recorded at their estimated fair value. Unconditional promises expected to be collected in future years are recorded at the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at an appropriate discount rate commensurate with the risks involved. Amortization of discounts is recorded as additional contribution revenue in accordance with donor-imposed restrictions, if any, on the contributions. Conditional promises to give are not recognized until they become unconditional, that is, when the conditions on which they depend are substantially met. Patient revenue - Patient revenue is reported at the amount that reflects the consideration to which WFUHS expects to be entitled for providing patient care. These amounts are due from patients, third party payers, and others, and includes variable consideration for retroactive revenue adjustments due to settlement of reviews and audits. Revenue is recognized as performance obligations are satisfied. Performance obligations are determined based on the nature of the services provided by WFUHS. Revenue for performance obligations satisfied over time is recognized based on actual charges incurred in relation to total expected or actual charges. WFUHS believes that this method provides a reasonable depiction of the transfer of services over the term of the performance obligation based on the inputs needed to satisfy the obligation. Generally, performance obligations satisfied over time relate to patients receiving inpatient acute care services. WFUHS measures the performance obligation from admission into the hospital to the point when it is no longer required to provide services to that patient, which is generally at the time of discharge. These services are considered to be a single performance obligation. Revenue for performance obligations satisfied at a point in time is recognized when services are provided and WFUHS does not believe it is required to provide additional services to the patient. Generally, performance obligations satisfied at a point in time relate to outpatient services and pharmacy revenue. Because all of its performance obligations relate to contracts with a duration of less than one year, WFUHS has elected to apply the optional exemption provided in FASB ASC 606- 10-50-14(a) and, therefore, is not required to disclose the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to WAKE FOREST UNIVERSI TY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2019 (Dollars in thousands) 17 (Continued) performance obligations that are unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied at the end of the reporting period. The unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied performance obligations referred to above are primarily related to inpatient acute care services at the end of the reporting period. The performance obligations for these contracts are generally completed when the patients are discharged, which generally occurs within days or weeks of the end of the reporting period. WFUHS is utilizing the portfolio approach practical expedient in ASC 606 for contracts related to net patient service revenue. WFUHS accounts for the contracts within each portfolio as a collective group, rather than individual contracts, based on the payment pattern expected in each portfolio category and the similar nature and characteristics of the patients within each portfolio. The portfolios consist of major payer classes for inpatient revenue and outpatient revenue. Based on historical collection trends and other analyses, WFUHS has concluded that revenue for a given portfolio would not be materially different than if accounting for revenue on a contract- by-contract basis. WFUHS has agreements with third party payers that provide for payments to WFUHS at amounts different from its established rates. Payment arrangements include prospectively determined rates per discharge, reimbursed costs, discounted charges, and per diem payments. For uninsured patients who do not qualify for charity care, WFUHS recognizes revenue based on established rates, subject to certain discounts and implicit price concessions as determined by WFUHS. WFUHS determines the transaction price based on standard charges for services provided, reduced by explicit price concessions provided to third party payers, discounts provided to uninsured patients in accordance with WFUHS 's policy, and implicit price concessions provided to uninsured patients. Explicit price concessions are based on contractual agreements, discount policies, and historical experience. Implicit price concessions represent differences between amounts billed and the estimated consideration WFUHS expects to receive from patients, which are determined based on historical collection experience, current market conditions, and other factors. Generally, patients who are covered by third party payers are responsible for patient responsibility balances, including deductibles and coinsurance, which vary in amount. WFUHS estimates the transaction price for patients with deductibles and coinsurance based on historical experience and current market conditions. The initial estimate of the transaction price is determined by reducing the standard charge by any explicit price concessions, discounts, and implicit price concessions. Subsequent changes to the estimate of the transaction price are generally recorded as adjustments to patient service revenue in the period of the change. Adjustments arising from a change in the transaction price were not significant in fiscal year 2019 or 2018. Subsequent changes that are determined to be the result of an adverse change in the patient 's ability to pay are recorded as bad debt expense. Bad debt expense for the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 was not material to the consolidated statements of activities. Under the Medicare and Medicaid programs, WFUHS is entitled to reimbursement for billed current procedural terminology codes at fee schedule rates determined by federal and state governments. Differences between established billing rates and reimbursements from these programs are recorded as contractual adjustments to arrive at net patient service revenue. WAKE FOREST UNIVERSI TY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2019 (Dollars in thousands) 18 (Continued) Charity care - WFUHS cares for patients who meet certain criteria under its charity care policy without charge or at amounts less than its established rates. WFUHS does not pursue collection of amounts determined to qualify as charity care, and accordingly, such amounts are not recognized as revenue. Sales and services of auxiliary enterprises - Sales and services of auxiliary enterprises primarily consistent of revenues from athletics, residence halls, dining services, parking, and retail stores, which furnish goods and services to students, faculty, staff, and in some cases, the general public. Fee charges are directly related to the cost of goods provided or services rendered and are recognized accordingly. Student aid provided by the University in excess of tuition is reflected as a reduction of sales and services of auxiliary enterprises. Certain auxiliary revenues arise from contracts. Revenues from intercollegiate athletics ticket sales, media rights, licensing and royalties and other contracts are received and recognized concurrent with event-based obligations or the passage of contract terms, but typically within the fiscal year. However, season ticket proceeds received prior to the report date for events scheduled in the upcoming fiscal year are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as the associated events are completed. Charges to students for campus residence, dining and laundry services are substantially billed and collected prior to the end of each semester. Associated revenues are earned and recognized over the course of each semester as these services are delivered. Accounts receivable from students are typically insignificant at the end of each fiscal year. (t)Use of Estimates The University prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP that requires management to make estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the carrying amount of land, buildings, and equipment, the valuation of nonreadily marketable investments, investments in real estate, allowances for receivables, third-party payer settlements, and any other implicit price concessions, AROs, professional liabilities, interest rate swap obligations and obligations related to employee benefits. Actual results could differ from those estimates. (u)Income Taxes The University is a tax-exempt organization as described in Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Reven ue Code (the Code) and is generally exempt from federal income taxes on related income pursuant to Section 501(a) of the Code. If applicable, unrelated business income is reported by all member and subsidiary organizations on IRS Form 990-T. Fiscal years ending on or after June 30, 2016 remain subject to examination by federal and state tax authorities. The University has evaluated uncertain tax positions for the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, including a quantification of tax risks in areas such as unrelated business income and taxation of its for-profit subsidiaries. This evaluation did not identify any material items that effect the consolidated financial statements for the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018.WAKE FOREST UNIVERSI TY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2019 (Dollars in thousands) 19 (Continued) (v) Comparative Financial Information The consolidated financial statements include certain prior year information for comparative purposes, which does not include sufficient detail to constitute a presentation in conformity with GAAP. Accordingly, such information should be read in conjunction with the University 's consolidated financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2018 from which this information was derived. The prior year information has been adjusted to adopt ASU 2016-14 as discussed in Note 1(b). (2) Liquidity and Availability Financial assets available for general expenditure within one year of June 30 are as follows: 2019 Reynolda Campus WFUHS Total Cash and cash equivalents 44,889 19,175 64,064 Accounts receivable, net 12,343 to be liquidated 252,993 359,805 612,798 Total financial assets available within one year $ 310,225 559,127 869,352 In addition to amounts included above, as part of the University 's liquidity management, it invests cash in excess of daily requirements in short-term investments. To help manage unanticipated liquidity needs, Reynolda Campus and WFUHS have committed lines of credit with a total borrowing capacity of $100,000 and $150,000, respectively, at June 30, 2019 which could be drawn upon. Additionally, Reynolda Campus and WFUHS has board-designated endowment funds of $234,852 and $296,761, respectively at June 30, 2019. Although the University does not intend to spend from the board-designated endowment funds other than amounts appropriated for general expenditures as part of its annual budget approval and appropriation, amounts from the board-designated endowment funds could be made available, subject to certain lock-up provisions that reduce the total investments that could be made available if necessary. WAKE FOREST UNIVERSI TY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2019 (Dollars in thousands) 20 (Continued) (3)Accounts Receivable The following is an analysis of accounts receivable at June 30, 2019 and 2018: 2019 Reynolda 2018 Campus WFUHS Total Total Accounts for bad debts Accounts receivable, net $ 12,343 114,138 126,481 109,102 (4) Student Services Revenue Student services revenue consists of revenue for tuition and fees, housing, and dining. The revenue is determined based on published rates for such services less any institutional financial aid awarded by the University to qualifying students. The University 's policy attributes aid first to tuition and fees and any excess to auxiliary services, for financial reporting purposes. 2019 Reynolda Campus WFUHS 2018 Published Financial Net Published Financial Net Published Financial Net Rates Aid Revenue Rates Aid Revenue Rates Aid Revenue Student tuition and fees Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2019 (Dollars in thousands) 21 (Continued) (5) Patient Revenue and Patient Receivables Patient revenue by major payer source, net of price concessions, is as follows for the years ended June 30: 2019 2018 Medicare and Medicaid $ 260,231 43% 202,918 39% Managed care and commercial Self-pay, insured 11,138 2 1 3,717 1 Patient revenue $ 601,476 100% 519,930 100% Concentration of Credit Risk WFUHS grants credit without collateral to its patients, most of whom are insured under third-party payer agreements. The mix of receivables from patients and third-party payers was as follows as of June 30: 2019 2018 Medicare and Medicaid 43% 42% Managed care and commercial insurance 23 20 Self-pay, insured 14 14 Self-pay, uninsured 5 7 Other 15 17 100% 100% As a result of certain changes required by ASU 2014-09, the majority of WFUHS ' provision for bad debts is recorded as a direct reduction to patient revenue instead of being presented as a separate line on the consolidated statement of activities. The adoption of ASU 2014-09 has no impact on WFUHS ' net patient receivables, as it was historically recorded net of provision for bad debts and contractual adjustments on the consolidated balance sheet. WFUHS maintains records to identify and monitor the level of charity care it provides. These records include the amount of charges foregone and estimated costs incurred for services and supplies furnished under its charity care policy and equivalent service statistics. Costs incurred are estimated based on the ratio of total operating expenses to gross charges applied to charity care charges foregone. The amounts of direct and indirect costs incurred for services and supplies furnished under WFUHS ' charity care policy totaled $19,871 and $16,615 in 2019 and 2018, respectively. WAKE FOREST UNIVERSI TY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2019 (Dollars in thousands) 22 (Continued) (6) Contributions Receivable The following is an analysis of the maturities of the University 's contributions receivable at June 30, 2019 and 2018: 2019 Reynolda 2018 Campus WFUHS Total Total One year or less $ 31,023 5,059 36,082 37,314 Between one and five More than five net $ 111,828 7,040 118,868 115,280 Contributions receivable are discounted at a rate commensurate with the scheduled timing of receipt. Such amounts outstanding as of June 30, 2019, and 2018, were discounted at rates ranging from 1.46% to 2.55% for Reynolda Campus, respectively, and 2.96% to 3.88% for WFUHS, respectively. Contributions receivable, net for Reynolda Campus included significant pledges from a few donors and perpetual commitments from a foundation with a long-standing history of support to the University. These long-term unconditional promises to give represented 69% and 65% of Reynolda Campus ' net contributions receivable as of June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. (7) Notes Receivable The following is an analysis of notes receivable at June 30, 2019 and 2018: 2019 Reynolda 2018 Campus WFUHS Total Total Student loans receivable $ 14,863 989 15,852 18,377 Other notes receivable 4,525 19,388 989 20,377 22,605 Less: estimated uncollectible amounts (438) (47) (485) (511) Notes receivable, net $ 18,950 942 19,892 22,094WAKE FOREST UNIVERSI TY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2019 (Dollars in thousands) 23 (Continued) The University makes uncollateralized loans to students based on financial need. Student loans are funded through Federal government loan programs or institutional resources. At June 30, 2019 and 2018, student loans receivable consisted of Federal loan programs of $14,258 and $16,909, respectively, and institutional loan programs of $605 and $635, respectively. The University participates in the Perkins federal revolving loan program. The availability of funds for loans under the program is dependent on reimbursements to the pool from repayments on outstanding loans. Funds advanced by the Federal government of $8,138 and $8,222 at June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, are ultimately refundable to the federal government and are reported as government grants refundable on the consolidated balance sheet. Outstanding loans canceled under the program result in a reduction of the funds available for loan and a decrease in the liability to the federal government. The Federal Perkins Loan Program expired on September 30, 2017, and the University has implemented procedures to wind-down the program. The University plans to maintain the Perkins outstanding loans and based on review of the prior collection history has recorded an allowance for uncollectible Perkins loan amounts of $206 and $206 as of June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Allowances for uncollectible institutional student loans are based on prior collection experience and current economic factors, which, in management 's judgment, could influence the ability of loan recipients to repay the amounts per the loan terms. Institutional student loan balances are written off only when they are deemed to be permanently uncollectible. At June 30, 2019 and 2018, the allowance for uncollectible institutional student loan amounts was $232 and $247, respectively. (8) Investments Investments at June 30, 2019 and 2018 consist of the following: 2019 estate:(g)9,732 15,312 Beneficial interest trusts and assets held by others(h)29,925 29,614 Other(i)205,842 178,140 Total investments $ 1,990,670 1,909,991 (a)Includes short duration U.S. Treasury debt securities and other short-term, higher quality debt securities, cash and money market mutual funds.WAKE FOREST UNIVERSI TY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2019 (Dollars in thousands) 24 (Continued) (b)Includes investments in hedge funds and hedge fund- of-funds that invest both long and short on a global basis primarily in: equity securities (common stocks), credit securities (both investment grade and noninvestment grade), commodities, and currencies. In aggregate, the expectation is that the returns of this segment should not be highly correlated to the broad equity market. Includes $1,288,064 and $1,237,025 of funds managed by Verger valued under the NAV practical expedient in fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively, whose underlying investments were comprised of 53.0% and 49.1% of equities, 12.3% and 13.5% of real assets, 19.4% and 22.4% of absolute return, and 15.5% and 15.0% fixed income in fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively. (c)Includes primarily illiquid investments in timberland, oil and gas properties, and water rights and entitlements held through limited partnership interests. While many of the investments are U.S. focused, some are more global. The category also includes more liquid allocations made to commodity (precious metals, industrial materials, and energy) mutual funds. (d)Includes long only, hedge strategies, and illiquid investments in various fixed income strategies (both U.S. and non-U.S.) including: investment grade securities, noninvestment grade securities, mortgage backed securities, asset backed securities, Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS), distressed debt, senior loans, and bank loans. The long only position also includes mutual funds that have daily liquidity in U.S. and non-U.S. fixed income markets. (e)Includes illiquid investments primarily in buyout, growth equity, and venture capital (both U.S. and non-U.S.) held through limited partnership interests. (f)Includes investments primarily in U.S. and non-U.S. common stocks (including emerging markets) as well as funds that invest in U.S. and non-U.S. common stocks (including emerging markets), mutual funds, and exchange traded funds. While most of the assets are invested long only, some assets are invested on a hedged basis (both long and short). (g)Includes illiquid investments in commercial real estate, residential real estate, and farmland held through limited partnership interests. While many of the investments are U.S. focused, some are more global. (h)Includes trusts and certain other assets held and administered by others which the University has an unconditional right to receive all or a portion of the specified cash flows. (i)Includes primarily funds held under retirement and benefit plans and other miscellaneous investments. In addition to the long-term pool, the University also manages other investment portfolios. Generally, these portfolios are invested in mutual funds, U.S. Treasury debt securities, and fixed income securities with daily liquidity. Each portfolio 's asset allocation is customized based upon the return and risk objectives and distribution requirements of the portfolio. (9) Endowment The University 's pooled endowment was established for a variety of purposes including both donor-restricted endowment funds and funds designated by the Board of Trustees to function as endowments. Net assets associated with endowment funds are classified and reported based on the existence or absence ofWAKE FOREST UNIVERSI TY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2019 (Dollars in thousands) 25 (Continued) donor -imposed restrictions. Gift annuities, beneficial interest in perpetual trusts and assets held by others, and contributions receivable are not considered components of the endowment. The Board of Trustees has interpreted the Uniform Prudent Management of Institutional Funds Act (UPMIFA) as allowing the University to appropriate for expenditure or accumulate so much of an endowment fund as the University determines is prudent for the uses, benefits, purposes, and duration for which the endowment fund is established, subject to the intent of the donor as expressed in the gift instrument. As a result of this interpretation, the University 's policy is to report as donor restricted net assets (a) the original value of gifts donated to the donor restricted endowment, (b) the original value of subsequent gifts to the donor restricted endowment, and (c) accumulations to the donor restricted endowment made in accordance with the direction of the applicable donor gift instrument at the time the accumulation is added to the fund. In accordance with UPMIFA, the board of trustees considers the following factors in making a determination to appropriate or accumulate donor-restricted endowment funds: 1.The duration and preservation of the fund 2.The purposes of the University and the donor-restricted endowment fund 3.General economic conditions 4.The possible effect of inflation and deflation 5.The expected total return from income and the appreciation of investments 6.Other resources of the University 7.The investment policies of the University The University has adopted investment and spending policies for endowment assets that support the objectives of optimizing long-term returns and providing a sustainable level of endowment income distribution to support the University 's activities through the annual operating budget while preserving the real (inflation adjusted) purchasing power of the endowment. The University 's primary investment objective is to maximize total return within reasonable and prudent levels of risk while maintaining sufficient liquidity to meet disbursement needs. The endowment spending rate of calculated as a percentage of the average of the previous three-year semiannual moving market value per unit and subject to a 10% maximum annual growth or decline in per-unit spending. The endowment spending rate for the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively were 5.0% and 5.15%, respectively, for Reynolda Campus, and 5.3% for WFUHS. The portfolio is constructed on a foundation of modern portfolio theory and strategic asset allocation. Under the direction of VCM the University diversifies its investments among various asset classes incorporating multiple strategies and investment advisors to help manage risk. Management and investment decisions are not made in isolation, but in the context of the portfolio of investments as a whole and as part of the overall investment strategy. WAKE FOREST UNIVERSI TY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2019 (Dollars in thousands) 26 (Continued) The University invests the majority of these assets in Verger Capital Fund. The University has established three individual unitized endowment pools for Reynolda Campus, Reynolda House, and WFUHS. The internal long-term pools are reported on a fair value basis, with each individual fund subscribing to or disposing of units based on the fair value per unit at the beginning of each quarter after which the transaction took place.

At times, the University may have individual donor -restricted endowment funds that are underwater. The University has a policy that permits spending from underwater funds depending on the degree to which the fund is underwater, unless specifically prohibited by the donor or relevant laws and regulations.

In general, for Level 2 and Level 3 investments, the University utilizes the investment manager to provide a valuation estimate based on disclosed techniques and processes, which have been reviewed for propriety and consistency with consideration given to type and investment strategy. The University 's policy is to recognize transfers into and out of Levels 1, 2, and 3 as of the end of the year or when a change in level becomes known. There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 securities during the years ended June 30, 2019 or 2018. Transfers into and out of Level 3 are typically the result of a change in observation of significant valuation inputs required by various models. Fair value for LIBOR-based interest rate swaps is determined using a relative price approach, by discounting the future expected cash flows at the market discount rate. For the variable leg of a swap, the expected cash flows are based on implied market forward rates for the appropriate underlying index. A credit value adjustment is applied to the total market value of the swap and quantifies the default risk of a counterparty using a default probability assumption based on the counterparty 's credit default swap pricing at year- end.

The following table presents the reconciliation of Level 3 assets measured at fair value for the year ended June 30, 2019.

Under the terms of such agreements, the University is required to provide funding, up to the total amount committed by the University, when fund managers make capital calls. These partnerships have a stated maturity date, but can provide for annual extensions for the purpose of disposing remaining portfolio positions and returning capital to investors. Alternatively, the fund may dispose of all portfolio investments and return all capital to investors before the stated maturity date. While the timing and amount of future capital calls and distributions in any particular year are inherently uncertain, the University considers these factors when allocating funds to private investments and believes that it has adequate liquidity to meet its obligations.

New obligations were issued to WFUHS obligation holders under the NCBH MTI. In addition, substantially all of the subsidiaries of NCBH and WFUHS were included in the single credit group as Designated Members (Combined Group). Under the new credit structure, each member of the Obligated Group is jointly and severally liable for all debt and other obligations that are evidenced and secured under the MTI. Bonds issued under the MTI are payable solely from the Obligated Group 's revenues (as defined by the MTI). Additionally, the Combined Group must remain compliant with certain covenants and restrictions required by the MTI and loan agreements underlying the bonds. The Combined Group is subject to covenants under th e MTI containing restrictions or limitations with respect to indebtedness, property encumbrance, consolidation or merger or transfer of assets. In addition, the Combined Group has agreed that it will not create any lien upon its property, accounts, or revenue now owned or hereafter acquired other than \"permitted liens \" as described in the MTI. WFUHS believes it is in compliance with such covenants and restrictions as of June 30, 2019. As of June 30, 2019, WFUHS is jointly and severally liable for $520,522 of bonds payable borrowed by the other members of the Obligated Group and for $33,750 and $30,190, respectively, under WFUBMC 's line of credit and notes payable.

Total amortization expense for issue costs and premium is included in interest expense in the consolidated statements of activities for Reynolda Campus and WFUHS totaled $942 and $1,050, respectively, for 2019. (13) Interest Rate Swap Agreements To manage the fixed/variable allocation of its debt portfolio, including hedging exposure to increasing interest expense from variable rate debt, the University utilizes interest rate swap agreements. The University has only limited involvement with derivative instruments and does not use them for trading purposes. Parties to interest rate swap agreements are subject to market risk for changes in interest rates as well as credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty. To minimize this exposure, the University verifies that the counterparties for these swap transactions are major financial institutions that meet the University 's criteria for financial stability and creditworthiness. Additionally, the University is exposed to tax basis risk since a change in tax rate environments will change the level of correlation between the interest rate payments made on the variable rate bonds and the percentage of LIBOR payments being received from the counterparties.WAKE FOREST UNIVERSI TY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2019 (Dollars in thousands) 38 (Continued) The following table summarizes the general terms for each of the University 's swap agreements: Reynolda Campus WFUHS November 2006 October 2008 December 2016 August 2002 interest rate interest rate interest rate interest rate swap swap swap swap Notional amount $ 7,340 Effective date August 20, 2002 Maturity date Rate received one-month one-month one-month one-month LIBOR LIBOR LIBOR LIBOR Rate paid 3.38 % Collateral provisions None if > $20,000 liability - $250 min Settlement frequency Monthly Monthly Monthly Weekly50,000 October 1, 2008 January 1, 2038 67% of 67% ofNovember 6, 2006 67% of 67% 3.61 % 100% liabilityJanuary 1, 2020 2.44 % 3.67 % None 100% asset/December 28, 2016 July 1, 2026 July 1, 203421,047 10,625 The University records all interest rate swap agreements in other liabilities and deferrals on the consolidated balance sheet at their respective fair values. The estimated amount the University would pay to terminate the swap agreements at the reporting date, taking into account current forward interest rates and the current forward creditworthiness of the swap counterparties, approximates the fair value of the interest rate swap. All changes in fair value are reflected as a gain or loss in nonoperating activities in the consolidated statement of activities.

In 2019, the Reynolda Campus amended an outstanding lease agreement associated with occupying space in the Wake Forest Innovation Quarter. The initial lease term is 15 years with two renewal options for a 5-year and 14-year period, respectively. The lease is classified as an operating lease. Operating lease payments are due monthly and expected payments each year from 2020 to 2024 are $2,917, $2,976, $3,035, $3,096 and $2,764 respectively, and $19,409 thereafter. WFUHS has entered into various operating lease agreements, which expire through 2029 and include varying renewal options. Total rent expense for the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 was $30,369 and $27,894, respectively. Minimum operating lease payments over the next five years are as follows: 2020 - $24,542; 2021 - - $21,073; - $20,860; and in the years thereafter - $72,307. The estimated cost to complete construction in progress at June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, were $63,433 and $66,618 for Reynolda Campus, and $13,935 and $25,603 for WFUHS. Expenditures related to federal and state grants and contracts are subject to adjustment based upon review by the granting agencies. Amounts of expenditures that granting agencies might disallow cannot be determined at this time. These amounts affect government grants and contracts revenue as well as facilities and administrative cost recovery. The University would not expect these costs to influence the consolidated financial position significantly. The University is self-insured for dental benefits, self-insured or fully insured for retiree medical benefits (depending on retiree benefit elections), and self-insured for active employees receiving medical benefits. The University provides an accrual for actual claims reported but not paid and a provision for incurred but not reported claims based on historical trends. Accrued employee health and dental costs, including estimated claims incurred but not reported, amounted to approximately $936 and $928 at June 30, 2019 and 2018, WAKE FOREST UNIVERSI TY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2019 (Dollars in thousands) 43 (Continued) respectively, for Reynolda Campus and $5,158 and $4,775 at June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, for WFUHS and are included in other liabilities and deferrals in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. The estimated liability for self-insurance claims will be significantly affected if current and future claims differ from historical trends. While management monitors reported claims closely and considers potential outcomes as estimated by its actuaries when determining its self-insurance liability accruals, the complexity of the claims, the extended period of time to settle the claims and the wide range of potential outcomes complicate the estimation. In the opinion of management, adequate provision has been made for this related risk. The University self-insures workers ' compensation liability with excess commercial insurance providing per loss and aggregate annual coverage. The University provides an accrual for actual claims reported but not paid and a provision for incurred but not reported claims based on historical trends, which is included in other liabilities and deferrals on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. The estimated liability for workers ' compensation claims will be significantly affected if current and future claims differ from historical trends. While management monitors reported claims closely and considers potential outcomes as estimated by its actuaries when determining its self-insurance liability accruals, the complexity of the claims, the extended period of time to settle the claims and the wide range of potential outcomes complicate the estimation. In the opinion of management, adequate provision has been made for this related risk. Under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPPA), the federal government has authority to complete fraud and abuse investigations. HIPPA has established substantial fines and penalties for offenders. WFUHS maintains policies, procedures and requires regular training sessions to employers to monitor compliance with HIPPA, as well as other applicable local, state and federal statutes and regulations. The University is involved in legal actions arising in the normal course of activities and is subject to periodic audits and inquiries by regulatory agencies. Although the ultimate outcome of such matters is not determinable at this time, management, after taking into consideration advice of legal counsel, believes that the resolutions of pending matters will not have a materially adverse effect, individually or in the aggregate, upon the University 's consolidated financial statements. (17) Sale-Leaseback Agreement In 2006, WFUHS entered into a sale-leaseback agreement to sell and lease back certain assets. The initial lease term is 20 years with four 5-year renewal options. The lease is classified as an operating lease. Operating lease expected payments in each year from 2020 to 2024 are $7,899, $7,978, $8,058, $8,139, and $8,220, respectively, thereafter. In 2010, WFUHS entered into another sale-leaseback agreement to sell and lease back certain assets. The initial lease term is 16 years with three 5-year renewal options. The lease is classified as an operating lease. Operating lease payments are due monthly and expected payments each year from 2020 to 2024 are $5,924, $6,072, thereafter.WAKE FOREST UNIVERSI TY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2019 (Dollars in thousands) 44 (Continued) WFUHS has a deferred gain related to the sale and leaseback of certain assets, which is amortized over the remaining lease term using the straight line method. The deferred gain was $15,288 and $17,234 at June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and is included in other liabilities and deferrals in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. (18) Retirement Plans Substantially all employees of the University are eligible to participate in defined contribution benefit plans. The University contributes a specified percentage of each employee 's salary to the plans. Contributions for the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, were $14,125 and $13,575 for Reynolda Campus and $33,714 and $30,958 for WFUHS. Certain employees of the University are eligible to participate in other benefit plans including a defined supplemental executive retirement plan, deferred compensation arrangements, and supplemental retirement agreements. The Reynolda Campus and WFUHS have accrued $2,519 and $5,747 at June 30, 2019, respectively, and $1,532 and $5,967 at June 30, 2018, respectively, for liabilities associated with these plans. These liabilities are included in other liabilities and deferrals on the consolidated balance sheet. (19) Postretirement Benefits The University sponsors defined benefit postretirement medical and dental plans that cover all of its full-time employees who elect coverage and satisfy the plans ' eligibility requirements when they retire. In addition, Reynolda Campus sponsors a death benefit plan, which pays a $2 benefit for each retiree. To be eligible, retired employees of Reynolda Campus must be at least 62 years of age with ten or more years of service or be at least 65 years of age with five or more years of service. WFUHS sponsors a defined benefit postretirement medical and dental plan that covers all WFUHS full-time employees who elect coverage and satisfy the plan eligibility requirements when they retire. On June 2, 2011, the Board of WFUHS approved that effective as of January 1, 2012, the defined benefit postretirement plan would be discontinued for most future retirees and the minimum age required for postretirement benefits will increase from 60 to 62. However, the additional requirement of the Rule of 75 (age and years of service) remains unchanged. All current retirees and currently eligible employees previously grandfathered will continue to be eligible for benefits under this plan. Any WFUHS employee who is within 5 years of meeting the new retirement eligibility of age 62 with combined age and years of service equal to at least 75 as of January 1, 2012 will be grandfathered into this benefit. The measurement date for the defined postretirement benefit plan is June 30.WAKE FOREST UNIVERSI TY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2019 (Dollars in thousands) 45 (Continued) The following table provides a reconciliation of the changes in each plan 's benefit obligation, fair value of plan assets, and funded status for the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018: 2019 Reynolda 2018 Campus WFUHS Total Total Change in benefit obligation: Benefit obligation at beginning of year $ 12,967 34,397 47,364 50,928 Service cost 563 27 590 599 cost 551 1,417 1,968 1,913 Participants' contributions paid (747) (1,965) end of year 15,298 28,126 43,424 47,364 Change in plan assets: Fair value of plan assets at beginning of year \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 Employer's contributions 306 1,604 1,910 2,090 (747) (1,965) (2,712) (2,844) Fair value of plan assets at end of year \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 Total liability $ (15,298) (28,126) (43,424) (47,364) Amounts recognized in unrestricted net assets: Prior service (cost) credit $ (3,422) 106 (3,316) (3,659) Net actuarial loss $ (4,944) 4,224 (720) (8,833)WAKE FOREST UNIVERSI TY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2019 (Dollars in thousands) 46 (Continued) The following table provides the components of net periodic benefit cost for the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018: 2019 Reynolda 2018 Campus WFUHS Total Total Service cost $ 563 27 590 599 Interest cost 551 1,417 1,968 1,913 Amortization of prior service credit (374) (30) (404) (404) Amortization of net actuarial (gain) loss (136) \u2014 (136) 544 Net periodic benefit cost $ 604 1,414 2,018 2,652 The prior service costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of active participants.

The actuarial net gain and prior service credit for the defined postretirement benefits plans that will be amortized from accumulated nonoperating income into net periodic benefit cost over the next fiscal year for Reynolda Campus and WFUHS are $374 and $485, respectively. The weighted average discount rate used to determine the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at June 30, 2019 for Reynolda Campus and WFUHS, respectively, was 3.67% and 3.37%, and at June 30, 2018 was 4.34% and 4.26%, respectively. The discount rate reflects the current yield curve results as of June 30, 2019 and 2018. For management purposes, Reynolda Campus used 7.70% and 6.80%, and WFUHS used 7.29% and 7.67% for 2019 and 2018, respectively, for the annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits for the first year, and a 4.50% rate was assumed in each year as the ultimate rate.

Recent federal healthcare legislation includes several provisions that may affect the University 's benefit plans, including imposing an excise tax on high cost coverage, eliminating lifetime and annual coverage limits, and imposing inflation-adjusted fees for each person covered by a health insurance policy for each policy plan year ending after September 30, 2012, through September 30, 2019. For the postretirement benefit plan, the changes due to recent federal healthcare legislation did not change the postretirement benefit obligation for Reynolda Campus and WFUHS.

We conducted our audit of compliance in accordance with auditing standar ds generally accepted in the Un ited States of America; the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards , issued by the Comp troller General of the United States; and the audi t requirements of Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance). Those standards and the Unifor m Guidance require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether noncomp liance with the types of complia nce requirements refe rred to above that could have a direct and material effect on a major federal prog ram occurred. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Un iversity's compliance with tho se requirements and performing such other procedures as we considered ne cessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provide s a reasonable basis for our o pinion on compliance for the major federal program. However, our audit does not provide a legal determination of the University's compliance. Opinion on the Major Federal Program In our opinion, the University com plied, in all material respec ts, with the types of compliance requirements referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on its major federal program for the year ended June 30, 2019. 65Other Matters The re sult s of our auditing pro cedures disclosed instances of noncompliance, which are required to be reported in accordance with the Uniform Guidance and which are described in the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs as items 2019-001, 2019-002, 2019-003 and 2019-004. Our opinion on each major federal program is not modifi ed with respect to these matters. The University's responses to t he noncompliance findings identi fied in our audit are described in the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs. The Uni versity is also responsible for preparing a corrective action plan to address each audit finding included i n our auditors' report. The University's responses and corrective action plan were not subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of compliance and, accordingly, we express no opini on on the responses or the corr ective action plan. Report on Internal Control over Compliance Management of the University is re sponsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over compliance with the types of compliance requirements referred t o above. In planning and performing our audit of compliance, we considered t he University's internal control over compliance with the types of requirements that could have a direct and material effect on a major federal program to determine the auditing procedures that are appropriate in the circ umstances for the purpose of ex pressing an opinion on compliance for each major federal program and to test and report on internal contro l over compliance in accordance with the Uniform Guidance, but not for the purpose of e xpressing an opin ion on the effectiveness of internal control over compliance. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the ef fectiveness of the Universi ty's internal control over compliance. A deficiency in internal control over compliance exists when th e design or operation of a control over compliance does not allow management or employees, in the norma l course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, noncompliance wit h a type of compliance requirement of a federal program on a timely basis. A material weakness in internal cont rol over compliance is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over complianc e, such that there is a reasonable possibility that material noncompliance with a ty pe of compliance requirement of a federal program will not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis. A significant defici ency in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program that is less severe than a mat erial weakness in internal control over compliance, yet important enough to merit attention by those ch arged with governance. Our consideration of internal control over compliance was for t he limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this sect ion and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control over compliance that might be material weaknesse s or significant deficiencies a nd therefore, material weaknesses or significant deficiencies may exist that hav e not been identified. We did not identify any deficiencies in internal control over compliance that we consider to be material weaknesses. However, we did identify certain deficiencies in internal control over complianc e, described in the accompanying schedule of findings an d questioned costs as items 201 9-0 01, 2019-002, 2019-0 03 and 2019-004, that we consid er to be significant deficiencies. The University's responses to the internal control over complia nce findings identified in our audit are described in the accompanying schedule o f findings and que stioned costs. The University is also responsible for preparing a correcti ve action plan to address each audit findin g included in our auditor's report. The University's responses and corrective action plan were not subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of compliance and, accordingly, we express no opinion on the respo nses or the corrective action plan. The purpose of this report on in ternal control over compliance is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over compliance and the results of that testin g based on the requirements of the Uniform Guidance. Accordingly, this repor t is not suitable for any othe r purpose. 66Report on S chedule of Expenditur es of Fede ral Aw ards Required b y the Uniform Guidance and the Schedule of Expenditures of State Awards We have audited the consolidat ed financial statements of the Un iversity as of and for the year ended June 30, 2019, and have issued our report thereon dat ed October 21, 2019 which contained an unmodified opinion on those consolidated financial sta tements. Our audit was conducte d for the purpose of fo rming an opi nion on the consolidated financial statement s as a whole. The accompanying schedule of expenditures of federal awards is presented for purposes of addition al analysis as required by th e Uniform Guidance and is not a required part of the consolidated financial statem ents. The accompanying schedul e of expenditures of state awards is also presented for purposes of addition al analysis and is not a requ ired part of the consolidated financial statements. Such information is the respon sibility of management and was de rived from and relates directly to the underlying accounting and other rec ords used to prepare the con solidated financial statements. The information has been subjected to the auditi ng procedures applied in the au dit of the consolidated financial statements and certain additional procedures, including comparing and reconcil ing such information di rectly to the underlying accounting and other records use d to prepare the consolidated financial statements or to the consolidated financial statements themselves , and other additional procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in t he United States of America. In our opin ion, the schedule of ex penditures of federal awards and the schedule of expendi tures of state awards are fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the consolidated financial statements as a whole.

Per 2 CFR 200.303, the non-Federal entity must establish and maintain effective inter nal control over the Federal award that provides reasonable assurance that the non-F ederal entity is managing the Federal award in compliance with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the Federal award. Condition For a nonmajor program, the Rese arch and Development cluster, while testing the remediation from the prior year finding, for 3 of 27 procurement transactions sample d, there was not sufficient documentation maintained to justify the lack o f competition related to each p rocurement at the time of purchase. Cause and Effect The procurement transactions did not include documentation suff icient to support lack of competition prior to the purchase authorization. Questioned Costs None identified. Sampling The sample was not intended to be, and was not, a statistically valid sample. Repeat Finding in the Prior Year A similar finding was reported in prior year's audit as finding 2018-001. Recommendation We recommend the University rei nforce their procurement policie s and procedures, which are designed to comply with 2 CFR Section 215.46 , to ensure that approval of a sole-source procur ement transaction cannot be completed without the documentation of justification for lack of competition. This documentation should be maintained. Views of Responsible Officials We concur with the auditor's as sessment and have amended sponso red research procurement approval procedures to require appropriate documentation prior to approv al.

Condition For 8 of 40 students, documentati on could not be provided to ev idence the required loan disbursement notification. Cause and Effect Management's control around revi ew of the loan disbursement notification process did not operate effectively to ensure that the di sbursement notification proces s was complete and timely. Questioned Costs None identified. Sampling The sample was not intended to be, and was not, a statistically valid sample. Repeat Finding in the Prior Year No. Recommendation We recommend the University enhan ce the control activity around the review of the loan disbursement notification process to determine that the notification has bee n sent and is timely. WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY Schedule of Findings and Questioned Costs Year ended June 30, 2019 70 (Continued) Views of Responsible Officials The Unive rsity agrees this recommendation. The University has e stablished a notification reminder process based on each school's academic c alendar. Additionally, a system control has been implemented that will identify notification send errors that occur. These controls will enable the University to identify and resolve notification issues in a timely manner. Finding 2019-003: Eligibility Federal Agency U.S. Department of Education Federal Program Student Financial Assistance Cluster (CFDA # 84.268) Federal Award Number and Federal Award Year P268K196953; July 1, 2018 through June 30, 2019 Criteria For Title IV programs, the cos t of attendance (COA) is generall y the sum of the following: tuition and fees; an allowance for books, supplies, transportation and miscellane ous personal expenses; an allowance for room and board; where applicab le, allowances for costs for depe ndent care; costs associated with study abroad and cooperative education; costs related to disabilities ; and fees charged for student loans.

Condition For 5 of 40 students, t he COA was calculated incorrectly for wh ich resulted in one of the five exceptions being overawarded by $275. The aggregate amount of federal aid sampled was $1,175,798. Cause and Effect Management's process for reviewing student financial aid award packages was not sufficiently precise to identify differences in the COA calculations. Questioned Costs There were known questioned costs of $275. Sampling The sample was not intended to be, and was not, a statistically valid sample. WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY Schedule of Findings and Questioned Costs Year ended June 30, 2019 71 (Continued) Repeat Finding in the Prior Year No. Re commendation We recommend the University enhan ce the control activity around the review of student financial aid packages to include a more precise review of COA. Views of Responsible Officials The University agrees with this recommendation. The University completed a full review of student accounts impacted by this COA calculation error. A total of $6, 953 in related over awards were identified and have been returned to the Depa rtment of Education. The University will implement additional review controls around the COA calcul ation before it is entered into the financial aid system of record. Additionally, the final approved COA document s will be compared to the COA bi lled to the student's financial account to ensure accuracy .

WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES Summary of Prior Year Audit Findings Year ended June 30, 2019 Finding No. 2018 -001: Procurement Grant Program/CFDA #: Research and Development Cluster/Various Requirement Per 2 CFR Section 215.46, procurement records shall include at a minimum: 1) basis for cont ractor selection; 2) justification for lack of competition, and 3) basis for price. Finding For 19 of 40 procurement transactions sampled, there was not sufficient documentation maintained to justify the lack of competition related to each procurement at the time of purchase. Status Partially Corrected Reason for Findings Recurrence The structure of the internal control was effectively designed; however, the attention and execution of the control appears to have lapsed for a period of time due to the management and staff turnover in the Office of Sponsored Programs , as well as the decentralized nature of the process initiation at the department level. Corrective Action Taken to Date The Office of Sponsored Programs and Strategic Sourcing have successfully implemented a multi -layer review and approval process that will capture all transactions and allow for adequate reviews of supporting documentation in a controlled environment. Remaining Corrective Actions Continu ed education and outreach in the form of recurrent institutional instruction, webinars and presentations to ensure policy adherence.
