Doctor as Teacher A Naturopathic Doctor treats the whole person, looking for and treating the cause of disease, rather than focusing on suppression of individual symptoms. Physical, mental, emotional and spiritual aspects of a patient's health are considered, because Naturopathic Doctors believe health is more than just the absence of disease. The most natural, least-invasive methods of treatment are used to stimulate the body's own innate ability to heal itself. Naturopathic Doctors teach patients how to adjust lifestyle and diet to prevent chronic disease. "}
