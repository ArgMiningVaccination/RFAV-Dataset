Autumn brings fresh goals, fresh perspectives, and fresh motivation, yet we remain committed to productive, ongoing efforts like the Culture Transformation Initiative (CTI). The CTI enforces the School of Medicine's dedication to cultivating our culture as a national model for a respectful, inclusive, and professional work environment. I recently welcomed all our new medical students, the Class of 2023. In addition to a majority representation of women among our entering classes, the Bressler Research Building's new lobby commemorates some of the most remarkable women in our medical and scientific history. I look forward to the conversations, reminiscences, and inspiration that this exhibit will elicit. One of my favorite parts about welcoming new members of our community is learning the varying interests and areas of our profession that stir their skilled and investigative minds. For our new colleague and Professor of Pediatrics, Allan Doctor, MD, that includes blood function as it relates to critical illnesses. Dr. Doctor leads the new Center for Blood Oxygen Transport & Hemostasis and the effort to develop an artificial blood product for trauma settings, like battlefields or rural areas with limited access to donated blood for transfusions. This new research center and Dr. Doctor's leadership bring the promise of critical advances in the field of hematology. Many rural communities in the United States experience an extreme lack of health care, including here in Maryland. The fact that so many of our neighbors live without access to the same health resources and conveniences that we are so privileged to have is unacceptable. This summer we received a new opportunity to address this need with the support from our partner, the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), who awarded our Department of Family and Community Medicine a three- year grant to establish a residency program in rural Eastern Shore communities. ...is the genuine enthusiasm I sense among the School of Medicine community for the new academic year.Clinical Departments Achieve High Rankings I am eager to highlight many more activities, accomplishments, and milestones at this year's State of the School Address on October 30 in Leadership Hall at 3:30 pm. Our theme will be \"Visionary Vanguards.\" The stories we are sharing this year will highlight our commitment to education, research, and clinical care, which has led to record-breaking funding and history- making innovations.

The award recognizes the Center's commitment to ensuring stroke patients receive the most appropriate treatment according to nationally recognized, research-based guidelines based on the latest scientific evidence. The center is staffed by faculty from the Department of Neurology's Stroke Division at the University of Maryland School of Medicine (UMSOM). \"Our center is dedicated to improving the quality of care for our stroke patients by implementing the American Heart Association's Get With The Guidelines-Stroke initiative,\" says Seemant Chaturvedi, MD, the Stewart J. Greenebaum Endowed Professor in Stroke Neurology at UMSOM and Director of the Stroke Program at the University of Maryland Medical System (UMMS). The Center earned the award by meeting specific quality achievement measures for the diagnosis and treatment of stroke patients at a set level for a designated period. Target: Stroke Honor Roll-Elite Plus means that the Center has met the standard for time between the patient's arrival at the hospital and treatment with the clot-buster tissue plasminogen activator, or tPA, the only drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat ischemic stroke, which is within 60 minutes in 75 percent or more of acute ischemic stroke patients treated with IV tPA and time to thrombolytic therapy within 45 minutes in 50 percent of acute ischemic stroke patients treated with IV tPA. Gold Plus means the CSC has met 24 consecutive months of achievement measures in GWTG. These measures include evaluation of the proper use of medications and other stroke treatments aligned with the most up-to-date, evidence-based guidelines with the goal of speeding recovery and reducing death and disability for stroke patients. Before discharge, patients should also receive education on managing their health, get a follow-up visit scheduled, as well as other care transition interventions. \"Stroke can be a complex and challenging condition. At the CSC, we are continually striving to provide the best and most advanced care to our stroke patients. We are honored to receive this prestigious designation,\" says Karen Yarbrough, DNP, ACNP-BC, CRNP, Director of the UMMC Comprehensive Stroke Center. \"Our nationally designated Comprehensive Stroke Center is among the busiest in the Mid-Atlantic region in providing high-acuity, emergent care,\" said Peter Crino, MD, PhD, Professor and Chair of UMSOM's Department of Neurology. \"This award greatly validates the efforts of our highly talented CSC team in their daily efforts to perform complicated and often life-saving procedures.\" Earlier this year, UMMC was again awarded the Joint Commission's Advanced Certification as a Comprehensive Stroke Center, reinforcing its position as one of nation's top programs to treat the most complex stroke patients. The two- year designation is awarded to fewer than 70 elite stroke centers in the nation.Quality Achievement Award Commitment to Outstanding Stroke Care RECOGNIZESSOM news Clinical Care University of Maryland School of Medicine 2PRIDE IN OUR PROGRAMSCOMPREHENSIVE STROKE CENTER \"This is another tremendous accomplishment for our faculty-physicians in UMMC's Comprehensive Stroke Center.\" \"The tools and resources provided help us track and measure our success in meeting evidence- based clinical guidelines developed to improve patient outcomes.\" - Dr. Chaturvedi - Dean E.

There are nearly 200 qualified pediatric centers in the country. Among children's hospitals nationally, the Children's Heart Program at UMCH ranks 32nd, moving up 9 positions from last year, when the program was ranked for the first time at 41st in the nation. \"It is an honor for our Children's Heart Program to be recognized a second time as being among the very best in the nation,\" says Steven J. Czinn, MD, Chair of the Department of Pediatrics at the University of Maryland School of Medicine (UMSOM) and Director of UMCH. \"We have an immensely talented, innovative team of doctors, nurses and staff who constantly challenge themselves to take the care we provide to a whole new level. It is because of their collaborative and pioneering spirit that this program has been so successful in caring for children with heart disease.\" The ranking demonstrates sustained excellence across the entire University of Maryland team in caring for children with complex, serious and life- threatening illnesses. The process is rigorous, looking at how well programs score on a number of quality measures and reviewing participation in efforts to continuously improve care. The ranking process included a comparison of pediatric-cardiac surgical outcomes at UMCH with similar programs across the United States, using data from the Society of Thoracic Surgery Congenital Heart Surgery Database. The Children's Heart Program at UMCH has seen some medical marvels this past year. One-year-old Tessa Agnoli received a heart transplant earlier in 2019, the youngest patient to have one at UMCH. Also this year, 12-year- old Lindsey Le had a double lung-heart transplant, a surgery that is rarely performed across the nation. The program was evaluated not only on the expertise of individual caregivers, but also on the support provided by the University of Maryland Medical Center across the clinical spectrum, from surgery and intensive care to the catheterization and electrophysiology labs, to echocardiography and advanced imaging. The ranking process looked at research efforts at UMSOM, and the work with hospitals throughout the 13-hospital University of Maryland Medical System. The process also evaluated other key areas that must work together to ensure the best results for some of the most vulnerable and tiny patients, including nursing, social work and child life services, neonatal and pediatric intensive care, anesthesiology, and pharmacy. The University of Maryland Children's Hospital at the University of Maryland Medical Center (UMMC) is recognized throughout Maryland and the mid-Atlantic region as a resource for critically and chronically ill children. UMCH physicians and staff excel in combining state-of-the-art medicine with family-centered care.SOM news Research &Discovery University of Maryland School of Medicine INSTITUTE FOR GENOME SCIENCES 4The vaginal microbiome is believed to protect women against Chlamydia trachomatis, the etiological agent of the most prevalent sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in developed countries. New research by the University of Maryland School of Medicine (UMSOM) shows how the microbiome can either protect or make a woman more susceptible to these serious infections. The research is important amid a rising number of cases of chlamydia worldwide. In the U.S. alone, 1.7 million cases of chlamydia were reported in 2017, a 22 percent increase since 2013, according to data from the Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC). \"Chlamydia is a major growing health issue in the U.S., and more work is needed to understand why some women are apparently naturally protected while others are not,\" commented Jacques Ravel, PhD, Professor of Microbiology and Immunology, Associate Director and Senior Scientist at the Institute for Genome Sciences (IGS) at UMSOM. The Vaginal Microbiome Dr. Ravel is also a Principal Investigator for this research. \"Our novel research aims to decipher the mechanistic and functional underpinnings of communication between the host and the cervicovaginal microbiome to better understand resistance and susceptibility to this infection.\" While Lactobacillus -dominated microbiota in a woman's vagina has long been suspected to provide a protective barrier against STIs like chlamydia, investigators at IGS and the University of Maryland School of Dentistry (UMSOD) are reporting for the first time a mechanism enabling specific types of cervicovaginal microbiome to predispose cells in the vagina and cervix to resist chlamydial infection. \"We will now be able to leverage these microbiomes to identify women at risk of infections, but more importantly to develop improved strategies to restore an optimal protection when it is lacking. Unlike our genes, the vaginal microbiome can be modulated to increase protection against chlamydia, but also against other sexually transmitted infections, including HIV ,\" said Dr. Ravel of the research, which was published Microbiota-Host Interaction Modulates Chlamydia trachomatis Infection.\" The investigators have shown previously that five major types of vaginal microbiome exist, four of which are dominated by a different species of Lactobacillus, while the fifth has very low numbers of Lactobacillus bacteria and is associated with an increased risk of adverse outcomes, including STIs such as HIV and even premature births. The current research showed that Lactobacillus iners, a bacterium actually commonly found in the vagina, did not optimally protect human cells against chlamydial infection, while products of Lactobacillus crispatus, another Lactobacillus species frequently found in the vagina, did. Patrik Bavoil, PhD, Professor & Chair, Department of Microbial Pathogenesis, UMSOD, a well-known expert in C. trachomatis biology and pathogenesis, is a Co-Principal Investigator with Dr. Ravel on the NIH funding that supported this study. The investigators also collaborated with Larry Forney, PhD, at the University of Idaho. This research was supported by the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) under award numbers U19A1084044 and UH2A1083264.Can Elicit Resistance or Susceptibility to Chlamydia 1.7 million cases of chlamydia were reported in the U.S. Dr. RavelSOM news Research &Discovery University of Maryland School of Medicine September 2019 Vol.21 N o.85Taking the Bite CENTER FOR VACCINE DEVELOPMENT AND GLOBAL HEALTH While only 6 millimeters long, the tiny mosquito continues have a huge impact on global heath, bearing diseases like malaria, dengue, and yellow fever that cause millions of deaths worldwide, especially in the world's most vulnerable populations. But now, researchers at the University of Maryland School of Medicine (UMSOM) have begun testing an experimental vaccine that is designed to protect against a series of these diseases. The experimental vaccine is important, as no vaccine to date offers full protection against malaria, which alone impacts more than 200 million people a year, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Researchers at the UMSOM Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health (CVD) have begun a Phase 1 clinical trial for an experimental vaccine called AGS-v PLUS, which targets proteins in mosquito saliva. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial will test safety and immunogenicity among small groups of healthy volunteers. According to Matthew Laurens, MD, MPH, Associate Professor of Pediatrics and Principal Investigator for the clinical trial, the current vaccine follows an earlier four-peptide version of the vaccine tested at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of The National Institutes of Health (NIH). The current AGS-v PLUS vaccine that UMSOM CVD is testing includes five peptides in efforts to train the immune response to recognize and target components of mosquito saliva, which may prevent diseases carried in mosquito spit glands. These diseases are transmitted to humans when mosquitoes bite and use their saliva to lubricate human skin and facilitate mosquito ingestion of human blood. Additionally, the vaccine may also reduce the lifespan of the mosquito that bites the vaccinated person. \"The concept that one vaccine can simultaneously impact multiple diseases carried by mosquitoes has huge potential implications for global health. Diseases carried by mosquitoes disproportionately affect the impoverished, and frequently resurface and resurge due to environmental conditions that may relate to climate change. An effective tool to combat these deadly diseases could prevent around 700,000 deaths annually,\" said Dr. Laurens. AGS-v PLUS, is developed by Imutex Limited, a joint venture between two UK-based companies, SEEK and h-VIVO. The clinical trial is currently funded by the Department of Health and Social Care in the U.K. and sponsored by the National Institutes of Health. The study is actively recruiting participants for a blinded controlled trial. Participants will be enrolled for approximately 12 months. The study population includes healthy adults aged 18 to 50 years old. For over 40 years, UMSOM CVD researchers have worked domestically and internationally to develop, test, and deploy vaccines to aid the world's underserved populations. As an academic enterprise, UMSOM CVD is engaged in the full range of infectious disease intervention from basic laboratory research through vaccine development, pre-clinical and clinical evaluation, large-scale pre-licensure field studies, and post-licensure assessments. OUT of Mosquito- Borne Diseases Children under the age of five account for 61 percent of all malaria deaths worldwide and continue to be the most vulnerable group affected by this disease. Dr. LaurensUMSOM Rural Residency Program In July, University of Maryland School of Medicine (UMSOM) Dean E. Albert Reece, MD, PhD, MBA, and David Stewart, MD, Associate Professor and Chair of the Department of Family and Community Medicine, jointly announced that the federal Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) awarded a $750,000 grant to establish a residency program in Maryland's rural Eastern Shore communities. This grant is part of a larger $20 million multi-year initiative by HRSA to expand the physician workforce in rural areas by developing new, sustainable residency programs in family medicine, internal medicine, and psychiatry. The recipients of the awards include rural hospitals, community health centers, health centers operated by the Indian Health Service, Indian tribes or tribal organizations, and schools of medicine. The goal of the UMSOM program is to develop a sustainable, accredited rural training track in Caroline, Dorchester, Kent, Queen Anne's and Talbot counties on Maryland's Eastern Shore, and to ultimately expand the area's rural primary care workforce. \"This program will help create a pipeline for expanding the physician workforce in rural, medically underserved areas on Maryland's Eastern Shore,\" said Dr. Stewart. A key aspect of the program involves strong partnerships with University of Maryland Shore Regional Health and the Choptank Community Health System. Residents in the rural track program will complete their first year of training in Baltimore and their final two years in medical practices and other clinical settings offered by these two health care organizations. Addressing the needs of underserved communities in Maryland is a core goal of the University of Maryland, Baltimore.FAMILY AND COMMUNITY MEDICINE SOM news Academic Innovations University of Maryland School of Medicine 6Addresses Growing Shortage of Primary Care Providers IN RURAL MARYLAND COMMUNITIES \"We are grateful for this generous support from the Health Resources and Services Administration.

We look forward to collaborating with our partners at UMSOM, UM Shore Regional Health, and the Eastern Shore Area Health Education Center as we work together to bring more primary care physicians to our rural communities,\" said Ms. Rich. The HRSA funding will be used to help recruit and train dedicated teaching faculty for the program, to recruit a diverse pool of primary care residency applications that reflect a demonstrable interest and dedication to the practice of rural health, and to develop and secure a clear and viable plan to sustain the rural residency program. Jason Ramirez, MD, Assistant Professor in the Department of Family and Community Medicine, is the Principal Investigator for the program. Over time, the program will include 12 residents, he said. \"Our goal is to achieve full accreditation and to recruit highly qualified medical students with track records of interest and dedication to practicing primary care in rural Maryland,\" said Dr. Ramirez. The sustainability of the program will also rely on support from the Maryland Department of Health as well as key organizational support from UM Shore Regional Health and Choptank Health. \"As a physician myself, I know it's important to train physicians in rural areas because many physicians consider staying in practice in the communities where they trained. This HRSA grant will help our shortage of physicians on the Eastern Shore of Maryland,\" said U.S. Representative Andy Harris (R-MD). With assistance from the Eastern Shore Area Health Education Center (ESAHEC), the success of the program will be evaluated by tracking the number of family physicians retained in the five-county region, their practice locations, scope of practice, and specific populations served. \"This grant is a huge win for our state \u2014 it will improve access to medical care for thousands of Marylanders and expand residency opportunities for physicians-in-training throughout the Eastern Shore. That's why I've consistently fought for funding for this program and others that improve the availability of health care services and bolster the pipeline of physicians practicing in rural areas. I will continue working to ensure communities across our state have affordable, reliable health care options,\" said U.S. Senator Christopher Van Hollen, (D-MD), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee.
