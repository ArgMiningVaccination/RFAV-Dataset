Uncertainty surrounding this process limits our ability to address inherited mtDNA diseases. We produce a new, physically motivated, generalisable theoretical model for mtDNA populations during development, allowing the rst statistical comparison of proposed bottleneck mechanisms. Using approximate Bayesian com- putation and mouse data, we nd most statistical support for a combination of binomial partitioning of mtDNAs at cell divisions and random mtDNA turnover, meaning that the debated exact magnitude of mtDNA copy number depletion is flexible. New experimental measurements from a wild-derived mtDNA pairing in mice conrm the theoretical predictions of this model. We analytically solve a mathematical description of this mechanism, computing probabilities of mtDNA disease onset, e \u0000cacy of clinical sampling strategies, and e ects of potential dynamic interventions, thus developing a quantitative and experimentally-supported stochastic theory of the bottleneck. Mitochondria are vital energy-producing within eukaryotic cells, possessing genomes (mitochondrial DNA or that replicate, degrade and develop mutations [1, 2]. MtDNA mutations have been implicated in numerous patholo- gies including fatal inherited diseases and ageing [3, 4, 5, 1]. Combatting the buildup of mtDNA mutations is of paramount importance in ensuring an organism's survival. Substantial recent medical, experimental and media attention focused on methods to remove [6] or prevent the inheritance of [7, 8, 5, 9, 10] mutated mtDNA in humans. One means by which organisms c i n gt h ee ective population size of mitochondrial genomes [11, 12]. One postulated bottleneck- ing mechanism is that this low population size accelerates ge- netic drift and so increases the cell-to-cell heteroplasmy variance [11, 13, 14, 15], which was rst observed to generally increase from primordial germ cells through primary oocytes to mature oocytes [16]. However, independent experimental evidence [12] suggests that heteroplasmy variance increases negligibly dur- ing this copy number reduction, though this interpretation has been debated [17]. Ref. [12] shows heteroplasmy variance copy number min- imum has been passed. In yet another picture, supported by conflicting experimental results [18, 19], heteroplasmy variance increases with a less pronounced decrease in mtDNA copy num- ber (a minimum copy number >103in mice), solely through random e ects associated with partitioning at cell divisions. Clearly a consensus on this important mechanism is yet to be reached. Important existing theoretical work on modelling the bottle- neck has assumed a particular underlying mechanism [13, 20] or derived statistics of mtDNA populations [21, 14, 22, 23] without explicitly considering changing mtDNA population size, or the discrete nature of the mtDNA population: e ects which may powerfully a ect mtDNA statistics. To capture these e ects it is necessary to employ a 'bottom-up' physical description 1of mtDNA as populations of individual, discrete elements sub- ject to replication and degradation, as in, for example, Refs. [21] and [24]. Exploring the bottleneck also requires explic- itly modelling partitioning dynamics throughout a series of cell divisions, over which population size can change dramatically. While previous simulation work [11, 25] has taken such a phi- losophy with specic model assumptions, we are not aware of such a study allowing for the wide variety of replication and partitioning dynamics proposed in the literature; we further not that replication-degradation-partitioning mtDNA models are yet to be fully described analytically. Nor is there a general quantitative framework under which di erent proposed bottle- neck mechanisms can be statistically compared given extant data (although statistical analyses focusing on particular mech- anisms and individual sets of experimental results have been used throughout the literature, for example, using a Bayesian approach under a particular bottleneck model to infer model bottleneck size [26]). Combined developments in theory and inference are therefore required to make progress on model encompass- ing proposed bottlenecking mechanisms We will consider three di erent classes of proposed generat- ing mechanisms for the mtDNA mechanisms: namely, those proposed in Cree et al. [11]; Cao et al. [18] and Wai et al. [12]. We will refer to these mechanisms by their leading author name. The Cree mechanism involves random replication and degradation of mtDNAs throughout development, and binomial partitioning of mtDNAs at cell divisions. The Cao mechanisminvolves partitioning of clusters of mtDNA at each cell division, thus providing strong stochastic e ects associated with each di- vision. We consider a general set of dynamics through which this cluster inheritance may be manifest, including the possi- bility of heteroplasmic 'nucleoids' of constant internal structure [31], of molecules or nucleoids within an organelle, homo- plasmic clusters, and di erent possible cluster sizes (see Ap- pendix 1). The Wai mechanism involves the replication of a subset of mtDNAs during folliculogenesis. We note that this latter mechanism can be manifest in several ways: (a) through slow random replication of mtDNAs (so that, in any given time window, only a subset of mtDNAs will be actively replicating) or (b) through the restriction of replication to a specic subset of mtDNAs at some point during development. We will refer to these di erent manifestations as Wai (a) and Wai (b) re- spectively. The Wai (a) mechanism and the Cree model can both be addressed in the same mechanistic framework (with potentially di erent parameterisations): if the rate of random replication in the Cree model is su \u0000ciently low during folliculo- genesis, only a subset of mtDNAs will be actively replicating at any given time during this period, thus recapitulating the Wai (a) mechanism (see Appendix 1). We will henceforth combine discussion of the Wai (a) and Cree mechanisms into what we term the birth-death-partition of mtDNA per cell is observed to vary dramatically during development, with dynamic phases of copy number depletion and di erent rates of subsequent recovery ob- served. Additionally, cell divisions occur in the germline at dif- ferent rates during development, with cells becoming largely quiescent after primary oocytes develop. To explicitly model these di erent dynamic regimes, and the behaviour of mtDNA copy number during each, we include with suitable parameterisation, can thus mirror the dynamics of the Cree and Wai (a) mechanisms (stochas- tic dynamics and binomial partitioning, which we refer to as the BDP mechanism); the Cao mechanism (clustered parti- tioning); and Wai (b) mechanism (deterministic dynamics, re- stricted subset of replicating mtDNAs). The Cao mechanism, partitioning of clusters of mtDNA molecules, represents the ex- pected case if mtDNA is partitioned in colocalised 'nucleoids' within each organelle (or in other sub-organellar groupings). The size of mtDNA nucleoids is debated in the literature [1, 39, 40] (although recent evidence from high-resolution microscopy suggests that nucleoid size is generally <2 [41], consonant with recent evidence that individual nucleoids may be homoplasmic [42]); our model allows for inheritance of homoplasmic or het- eroplasmic nucleoids of arbitrary characteristic size c, thus al- lowing for a range of sub-organellar mtDNA structure. We dis- cuss the impact of mixed or xed nucleoid content in Appendix 1. A birth-death-partition model of mtDNA dy- namics has most statistical support given ex- perimental measurements We take data on mtDNA copy number in germ line cells in mice from three recent experimental studies [11, 18, 12]. We also use data from two experimental studies on heteroplasmy variance in the mouse germ line during development [16, 12]. This data, by convention [17], is normalised by show that a subset of mitochondria retain BrU labelling, which the authors suggest indicates that a subset of mtDNAs are repli- cating. In Appendix 1, we that the heteroplasmy statistics corresponding to binomial partitioning also describe the case where the elements of inheritance are heteroplasmic clusters, where the mtDNA content of each cluster is randomly sampledfrom the population of the cell (either once, as an initial step, orrepeatedly at each division). This similarity holds broadly, re-gardless of whether the internal structure of clusters is constant across cell divisions or allowed to mix between divisions. The BDP model, in addition to describing the partitioning of indi-vidual mtDNAs, also thus represents the statistics of mtDNApopulations in which heteroplasmic nucleoids are inherited [31],or individual organelles containing a mixed set of mtDNAs ornucleoids are inherited, regardless of the size of these nucleoids (see Discussion). Parameterisation and interpretation \u0000=P6 i=3i0 i,t h e product of turnover rate and the time for which this rate ap- plies, summed over quiescent dynamic phases; for example, aturnover rate of 0 .1h r \u00001for 30 days yields \u0000=0.12430 = 72) is constrained more than the specic trajectory of mtDNAturnover rates, showing that a variety of time behaviours ofturnover are capable of producing the observed heteroplasmybehaviour.Experimental verication of the birth-death- partition model The bottleneck mechanism identied through our analysis hasseveral characteristic features which facilitate experimental ver-ication. Key among these are the prediction that heteroplasmyvariance acquires an intermediate (nonzero, but not maximal) value as a result of the copy number bottleneck, then contin- ues to increase due to mtDNA turnover in later development.Our theory also produces quantitative predictions regarding thestructure of heteroplasmy distributions at arbitrary times. The existing data that we used to perform inference and model selection display a degree of internal heterogeneity, com-ing from several di erent experimental groups. Furthermore, these data represent statistics resulting from a single pairing ofmtDNA types, and it is thus arguable how conclusions drawnfrom them may represent the more genetically diverse realityof biology. Ref. [44] recently addressed the issue of this limited number of mtDNA pairings by producing novel mouse models involving mixtures of standard and several new, unexplored,wild-derived haplotypes which capture a range of genetic diver-sity. To test the applicability and generality of our predictions,we have perfomed new experimental measurements of germlineheteroplasmy variance in these model animals under a consis- tent experimental protocol (see Methods). We use the 'HB' mouse line from Ref. [44] pairing a wild-derived mtDNA (labelled 'HB' after its source in Hohenberg, C57BL/6N; we refer to this model as 'HB'. Heteroplasmy measurements were taken in oocytes sampled from mice at ages 24-61dpc (see Methods and Appendix 1; raw data in Source data 1). The statistics of these measurements yielded E(h),V(h) and V 0(h) as previously. This age range was chosen to address the regions with most power to discrimi-nate between the competing models; the existing V 0(h) data is most heterogeneous around 20-30dpc and the later datapoints allow us to detect developmental behaviour measurements coupled with the E(m) measurements used previously (employing our assumption that modulation of copy number by heteroplasmy in this non-pathological haplotype is small). Strikingly, the quantitative behaviour of V0(h) with time inferred from the HB model (red) matches the previous behaviour inferred from the NZB/BALB/c sys- tem (blue) very well, suggesting that our theory is applicable across a range of genetically distinct pairings. We note the 4shaded region in Figure 4C corresponds to credibility intervals around the mean behaviour of V0(h), and the fact that indi- vidual V0(h) datapoints (subject to fluctuations and sampling eects) do not all lie within these intervals is not a signal ofpoor model choice. An analogous situation is the observationof a scatter of datapoints outside the range of the standard er-ror on the mean (s.e.m.), which does not imply a mistake inthe s.e.m. estimate. The di erence between the trace in Fig- ure 4A and the mean curve in Figure 4C arises because Figure4A shows the behaviour of the model under a single, optimisedparameterisation, whereas Figure 4C shows the distribution ofmodel behaviours over the posterior distributions on parame-ters: the mean V 0(h) trace of this distribution is comparable but not equivalent to that from the single best-t parameterisation. To conrm more detailed predictions of our model, we also examined the specic distributions of heteroplasmy in our newmeasurements. Given a mean heteroplasmy and an organismalage, the parameterised BDP model predicts the structure ofthe heteroplasmy distribution (see Methods and next section).We parameterised the model using V 0(h) values from a sub- set of half of the new measurements (chosen by omitting everyother sampled set when ordered by time). Figure 4D shows acomparison of measured heteroplasmy distributions with a 95% bound from the parameterised BDP model. We then testedthe predictions of the parameterised model against the otherhalf of new measurements. 8 of the test measurements (2.4%)fell outside the inferred 95% bound from the training dataset,illustrating a good agreement with distributional predictions.The Anderson-Darling test was used to compare the distribu-tion of heteroplasmy in sampled oocytes with distributions pre-dicted by our theory (given age and mean heteroplasmy); noset of samples showed signicant ( p< 0.05) departures from the hypothesis that the two distributions were identical. Someexample distributions are presented in Figure 4D (i), (ii), (iii). The birth-death-partition model is analyti- cally tractable Importantly, the birth-death-partitioning model yields analyticsolutions for the values of all genetic properties of interest, usingtools from stochastic processes (detail in Methods, Appendix 1).These results facilitate straightforward further study and fastpredictions of timescales and probabilities of interest. The fulltheoretical approach is detailed in Appendix 1, and equationsfor the mean and variance of mtDNA populations and hetero-plasmy are given in the Methods. In Figure 2A we illustratethat these analytic results exactly match the numeric results ofstochastic simulation, a result that holds across all BDP modelparameterisations. It is also straightforward to calculate thexation probability P(m= 0), which allows us to characterise all heteroplasmy distributions that arise from the bottleneckingprocess, even when highly skewed (see Methods and Appendix1). We have thus obtained analytic solutions for the time be-haviour of mtDNA copy number and heteroplasmy throughoutthe bottleneck with no assumptions of continuous populationdensities or xed population size, under a physical model withthe most statistical support given experimental data.Mitochondrial turnover, degradation, and se- lective pressures exert quantiable influence on heteroplasmy variance We can use our theory to explore the dependence of bottleneck dynamics on specic biological parameters. We rst explore the eects of modulating mtDNA turnover by varying \u0000 and in concert, corresponding to an increase in mtDNA degradation balanced by a corresponding increase in mtDNA replication. This increased mtDNA turnover increases the heteroplasmy variance due to bottlenecking (see Figure 5A). This result arises due to the increased variability in mtDNA copy number from the underlying random processes occurring at increased rates. Additionally, we nd that increasing mtDNA degradation without increasing \u0000 also increases heteroplasmy variance, in addition to decreasing the overall mtDNA copy number (Fig- ure 5B). Applying this unbalanced increase in mtDNA degra- dation without a matching change in replication h as a strong eect on mtDNA dynamics as it corresponds to a universal change in the 'control' applied to the system, analogous, for example, to changing target copy numbers in manifestations of relaxed replication [21]. The simple model we use does not in- clude feedback and controls mtDNA dynamics solely through kinetic parameters. Perturbing the balance of these parame-ters thus strongly aects the expected behaviour of the system. As we discuss later, elucidation of the specic mechanisms by which control is manifest in mtDNA populations will require further research, but these numerical experiments attempt to represent the cases where a perturbation is naturally compen-sated for (matched changes, Figure 5A) and where it is not (unbalanced change, Figure 5B). These results suggest that an articial intervention increas- ing mitochondrial degradation may generally be expected to increase heteroplasmy variance during development. An in-crease in mtDNA degradation is expected to either directlyincrease heteroplasmy variance (Figure 5B) if mtDNA popu-lations are weakly controlled, or to provoke a compensatory,population-maintaining increase in mtDNA replication, thus in-creasing mtDNA turnover, which also acts to increase variance(Figure 5C) if mtDNA populations are subject to feedback con-trol. The increase in variance through either of these pathwayswill increase the power of cell-level selection to remove cellswith high heteroplasmy and thus purify the population. Forthis reason, we speculate that mitochondrial degradation mayrepresent a potential clinical target to address the inheritanceof mtDNA disease (more detail in Appendix 1). Our model also allows us to explore the eect of di erent mtDNA types experiencing di erent selective pressures, by set- ting \u0000 1 6=\u00002(mutant mtDNA experiences a proliferative ad- vantage or disadvantage). Such a selective di erence causes changes in both mean heteroplasmy and heteroplasmy variance,as shown in Figure 5C (for example, if heteroplasmy decreasestowards zero, heteroplasmy variance will also decrease, as thewild type is increasingly likely to become xed). We do not fo-cus further on selection in this study, noting that selective pres- sures are likely to be specic to a given pair or set of mtDNA types and are not generally characterised well enough to perform 5satisfactory inference. However, we do note that our theory gives a straightforward prediction for the functional form of mean heteroplasmy when nonzero selection is present, a sigmoid with slope set by the tness dierence (see Methods). Probabilities of exceeding threshold hetero- plasmy values A key feature of mtDNA diseases is that pathological symp- toms usually manifest when heteroplasmy in a tissue exceeds acertain threshold value, with few or no symptoms manifestedbelow this threshold [45]. The probability and timescale as-sociated with which cellular heteroplasmy may be expected toexceed a given value is thus a quantity of key interest in clinical planning of mtDNA disease strategies. In our model, the probability, as a function of time, of a cell containing m 1wildtype and m2mutant mtDNAs can be straightforwardly derived. The resultant analytic expression involves a hypergeometric function, also an important math-ematical element in expressions describing mtDNA statistics based on classical population genetics [23, 46]. The probability of obtaining a given heteroplasmy can therefore be computedas a sum over all copy number states that correspond to thatheteroplasmy. However, as hypergeometric functions are com-paratively unintuitive and computationally expensive, we here employ an approximation to the distribution of heteroplasmy based upon the above moments that are straightforwardly cal-culable from our model. This approximation involves xationprobabilities for each mtDNA type and a truncated Normaldistribution for intermediate heteroplasmies (see Methods). InAppendix 1 we show that this approximation corresponds well to the exact distributions calculated using the hypergeometric function. We underline that exact heteroplasmy distributionsare straightfoward to compute using our approach: we use thetruncated Normal approximation as it represents the exact dis-tribution well, is more intuitively interpretable, and is embryonic het- eroplasmy We next turn to the question of estimating heteroplasmy levelsin a developed organism by sampling cells during development. This principle, clinically termed preimplantation genetic diag-nosis [5, 47], assists in clinical planning by allowing inference of the specic heteroplasmic nature of the embryo itself ratherthan a population average of an aected mother's oocytes [48].However, the complicated and stochastic nature of the bottle- neck makes this on the bottleneck. A key debate in the literature has focussed on the magni- tude of the bottleneck. Some studies [11, 15] have observeda depletion of mtDNA copy number during the bottleneck to minima around several hundred; other studies [18, 19] have ob-served that mtDNA copy number remains >10 3.O u r s t u d y shows that observed increases in heteroplasmy variance [16, 12]can be achieved across this range of potential minimal mtDNA copy numbers, meaning that the much-debated magnitude of 6mtDNA copy number reduction is not the sole critical fea- ture of the bottleneck, in agreement with arguments from Refs. [18, 19, 12]. We nd that the role of stochastic mtDNA dy- namics can play a key role in determining heteroplasmy vari- ance without additional mechanistic details, in keeping with approaches proposed by Ref. [11]. The mechanism with the most statistical support is thus consistent with aspects from all existing proposals in the literature. We have shown that, of the models proposed in the litera- ture, a birth-death-partitioning model, proposed after Ref. [11] and compatible with an interpretation of Ref. [12], is the in- dividually most likely mechanism, and capable of producing experimentally observed heteroplasmy behaviour. We cannot, given current experimental evidence, discount hybrid mecha- nisms, where birth-death-partitioning dominates the popula- tion dynamics but small contributions from other mechanisms provide perturbations to this behaviour, and propose experi- ments to conclusively distinguish between these cases (see Ap- pendix 1). As the expected statistics of mtDNA populations undergoing inheritance of heteroplasmic mtDNA clusters is very similar to those undergoing binomial partitioning of mtDNAs (see Appendix 1), the inheritance of heteroplasmic nucleoids (as opposed to individual mtDNAs) is not excluded by our nd- ings, though other recent experimental evidence suggests that this situation may be unlikely [42, 41]. We contend that the most likely situation may involve the partitioning of individual organelles, containing a mixture of homoplasmic nucleoids of characteristic size <2. Notably, this case (inheritance of het- eroplasmic groups, likely with fluid structure due to mixing of organellar content and mitochondrial dynamics), gives rise to statistics which our binomial model reproduces (see Appendix 1). As mentioned in the model description, it is likely that mi- tochondrial dynamics (ssion and fusion of mitochondria) [35] play a role in determining natural mtDNA turnover, and par- ticularly mtDNA turnover in the presence of pathological mu- tations [49], through the mechanism of mitochondrial quality control [32, 37]. Mitochondrial dynamics may also influence the elements of partitioning, through changes in the connectiv- ity of the mitochondrial network. In our current model, these influences are coarse-grained into descriptions of the dynamic rates of mtDNA replication and degradation, and the character- istic elements that are partitioned at divisions. These physical parameters, as opposed to the more microscopic details of mito- chondrial dynamics, are expected to be the key determinants of heteroplasmy statistics through development. Accounting for how these parameters, which summarize the relevant outputs of mitochondrial dynamics, connect to details of microscopic models of mitochondrial dynamics is an important future re- search direction to be addressed when more quantitative data is available. The experimental data used to parameterise the rst part of our study was taken from four studies in mice. Observation of similar dynamics in salmon [20] points towards the bottle- neck being a conserved mechanism in vertebrates. We also note that our results in mice are broadly consistent with ndings from recent experiments in other organisms, suggesting that inprimates and humans, heteroplasmy variance may increase at early developmental stages [50, 51], and that partitioning of mitochondria is binomial in HeLa cells [52]. As more studies become available on human mtDNA behaviour during develop- ment we will test our model's applicability and its clinical pre- dictions. We note that the results of a recent study of human preimplantation sampling [48] found that earlier measurements provided strong predictive power of mean heteroplasmy, about which substantial variation was recorded in the o spring - both of which results are consistent with the application of our model to theoretical sampling considerations. In addition, recent ob- servations that the m.3243 A>G mutation in humans both increases mtDNA copy number during development [53], and displays a less pronounced increase of heteroplasmy variance [51] than other mutations, are consistent with the link between heteroplasmy variance and mtDNA copy number in our theory. The combination of modern stochastic and statistical treat- ments that we have employed provides a generalisable and pow- erful way to recapitulate experimental data and rigorously de- duce underlying biological mechanisms. We have used this com- bination to explore pertinent questions regarding the mtDNA bottleneck (and others have used a similar philosophy to nu- merically explore mtDNA point mutations [25]): we hope to convince the reader that such methodology may be appropriate to explore other problems involving stochastic biological sys- tems. We have used new experimental measurements to conrm our theoretical ndings, illustrating the benecial and power- ful coupling of mathematical and experimental approaches to address competing hypotheses in the literature. Our detailed elucidation of the bottleneck allows us to propose further exper- imental methodology to address the current unknowns in our theory, including the specics of mtDNA partitioning at cell division and the roles of selective di erences between mtDNA types; importantly, we also propose a strategy to investigate our claim that our most supported model is compatible with the subset-replication picture of mtDNA dynamics. We list these experiments in full in Appendix 1. Finally, we believe that the theoretical foundation for mtDNA dynamics that we have produced allows increased quantitative rigour in the pre- dictions and strategies involved in mtDNA disease therapies, illustrated by the above application of our theory to problems in mtDNA sampling strategies, disease onset timescales, and interventions to increase the power of the bottleneck. Methods General model for mtDNA dynamics. Our 'bottom-up' model represents individual mtDNAs as elements which repli- cate and degrade either randomly or deterministically according to the model parameterisation. Consonant with experimental studies showing that it is often a single mutant genotype that dominates the non-wildtype mtDNA population of a cell [54], we consider two mtDNA types (wildtype and mutant), though our model can readily be extended to more mtDNA types. We denote the number of 'wild-type' mtDNAs cell as the number of 'mutant' mtDNAs as m2. The heteroplasmy of a cell is then h=m2 m1+m2, that is, the population proportion of 7mutant mtDNA. MtDNA dynamics within a cell cycle. Individual mtD- NAs are capable of replication and degradation, with rates de- noted \u0000andrespectively. According to a binary categorical parameter S,t h e s ee v e n t sm a yb ed e t e r m i n i s t i c( S= 0; the mtDNA population replicates and degrades by a xed amount per unit time) or Poisson processes ( S= 1; each individual mtDNA degrades with average rates \u0000and). A parameter controls the proportion of mtDNAs capable of replication: = 1 allows all mtDNAs to replicate throughout development, <1 enforces a subset proportion of replicating mtDNAs a time cuto Tafter conception. MtDNA dynamics at cell divisions. A parameter c (cluster size; a non-negative integer) dictates the partitioning of mtDNAs at cell divisions. When c= 0, partitioning is de- terministic, so each daughter cell receives exactly half of its parent's mtDNA. For c>0, partitioning is stochastic. When c= 1, partitioning is binomial: each mtDNA has a 50% chance of being inherited by either daughter cell. When c>1, the parent cell's mtDNAs are grouped in clusters of size cbefore division. Each cluster is then partitioned binomially, with a 50% chance of being inherited by either daughter cell. Dierent dynamic phases through development. The mtDNA population changes in di erent ways as development progresses, rst decreasing, then recovering, then slowly grow- ing. We include the possibility of di erent 'phases' of mtDNA dynamics in our model to capture this behaviour. Each phase jhas its own associated pairs of \u0000j,jparameters and may either be quiescent (involving no cell divisions) or cycling (en- compassing njcell divisions). Thus, we may have an initial cycling phase with low mtDNA replication rates, so that copy number falls for several cell divisions, then a subsequent 'recov- ery' cycling phase with higher replication rates so that mtDNA levels are amplied, then quiescent phases as cell lineages are identied. We allow six di erent phases, with the rst two xed as cycling phases with the above doubling times, and the nal phase xed to include no mtDNA replication (representing the stable, nal occyte state). Initial conditions. The initial conditions of our model involve an initial mtDNA copy number m0(the total number of an initial heteroplasmy h0(the fraction of these mtDNAs that are mutated). Data acquisition. We used three datasets for mtDNA copy number during mouse development: Cree [11]; Cao [18]; Wai We during development: Wai [12] and Jenuth we use the normalised versions of heteroplasmy variance (that is, measured variance divided by a factor h(1\u0000h)). Where the measurements were not given explicitly in these publica- tions, we manually analysed the appropriate gures to extract the numerical data. For these values, we used data from cor- respondence regarding the Wai study (reply to Ref. [17]), and manually normalise the Jenuth dataset. The Jenuth dataset contains measurements taken in 'mature oocytes' with no time given; we assume a time of 100 dpc for these measurements, though this time is generalisable and does not qualitatively af- fect our results. All values are presented in Appendix 1. Dataon cell doubling times in the mouse germ line is taken from Ref. [43], suggesting that doubling times start with an interval of every 7h, then after around 8.5 days post conception (dpc) increase to 16h, before the onset of a quiescent regime around 13.5 dpc (roughly consistent with the estimate of 25 divisions between generations in the female mouse germ line [55]). Simulation, model selection, and parametric infer- ence. We use Gillespie algorithms, also known as stochas- tic simulation algorithms [56], to explore the behaviour of our model of the bottlenecking process for a given parameterisation. For a given model parameterisation, the Gillespie algorithm is used to simulate an ensemble of 103possible realisations of the time evolution of mtDNA content, and the statistics of this en- semble are recorded. The experimental data we use is derived from sets of measurements of di erent sizes; to compare simula- tion data with an experimental datapoint icorresponding to a statistic derived from nimeasurements, we sampled a random subset of niof the 103simulated trajectories (all datapoints but one have n103), and used this subset to derive the simulated statistic for comparison to datapoint i[29]. To t the di erent models to experimental data we dene a distance measure, a sum-of-squares residual between the E(m) (in log space) and V(h) dynamics produced by our model and observed in the data, weighted to facilitate comparison of these dierent quantities [29]. We also constrain copy number to be <5105at all points throughout development, rejecting pa- rameterisation that disobey this criterion. Metropolis MCMC was used to identify the best-t parameterisation according to this distance function. For statistical inference, we use approxi- mate Bayesian computation (ABC), a statistical approach that has successfully been applied to parametric inference and model selection in dynamical systems [30] to infer posterior probabil- ity distributions both for individual models and the parameters of the models given experimental data. ABC samples poste- rior probability distributions on parameters that lead to be- haviour within a certain threshold distance of the given data; these posteriors are shown to converge on the true posteriors as the threshold value decreases to zero (see Appendix 1). We em- ployed an MCMC sampler further details, including priors, thresholds and step sizes used in ABC, see Appendix 1. Minimum copy number was recorded directly from the resulting trajectories; our measure of total turnover \u0000is dened as \u0000=P6 i=30 ii,t h es u mo v e r quiescent dynamic phases of the product of degradation rate and phase length. Creation of heteroplasmic mice. Heteroplasmic mice were obtained from a heteroplasmic mouse line (HB) we cre- ated previously by ooplasmic transfer [44]. This mouse line contains the nuclear DNA of the C57BL/6N mouse, and mtD- NAs both of C57BL/6N and a wild-derived house mouse. Both mtDNA variants belong to the same subspecies, Mus musculus domesticus . For details on sequence divergence see Ref. [44]. Isolation and lysis of oocytes. Mice were sacriced at the indicated ages by cervical dislocation. Ovaries were ex- tracted and immediately placed in cryo-bu er containing 50% ethylene glycol For extraction, ovaries were 8placed into a drop of cryo-bu er and disrupted using scalpel and forceps. Oocytes were collected and remaining cumulus cells were removed mechanically by repeated careful suction through glass capillaries. Prepared oocytes were then washed in PBS before they were individually placed into compartments of 96-well PCR plates (Life Technologies, Austria) containing 10 \u00b5l of oocyte-lysis bu er [50] covered stages from primary oocytes of 3 day-old mice up to mature oocytes of 40 day-old mice. Samples were lysed at 55oC for 2 h, and incubated at 95oC for 10 min to inactivate Proteinase K. The cellular DNA extract was nally diluted in 190 \u00b5lT r i s - EDTA bu er, pH 8.0 (Sigma-Aldrich, Austria). 3 \u00b5L were used per qPCR reaction. Amplication Refractory Mu- tation System (ARMS)-qPCR, an established method in the eld [57, 58, 59], as described in Ref. [44]. The study was conducted according to MIQE (minimum information for pub- lication of quantitative real-time PCR experiments) guidelines proportion between and C57BL/6N mtDNA was determined by ARMS-qPCR in mt-rnr2 [44]. These assays were normalised to changes in the input mtDNA amount by consensus assays, located in conserved regions of mt-Co2 and mt-Co3 (see Appendix 1). For the calculation of mtDNA heteroplasmy, assay detecting the minor allele (C57BL/6N <50%) was always used. If both specic assays gave values >50% (which can happen around 50% heteroplasmy), the mean value of both as- says was taken. All qPCR runs contained no template controls (NTCs) for all assays; these were negative in 100%. Further experimental details available in Appendix 1. Analytic model. In the birth-death-partitioning model, processes within a cell cycle constitute a birth-death process which can be solved using generating functions [61]. For bino- mial partitioning, the generating function for the system after an arbitrary number of divisions has a recursive structure [62] and an analytic solution can be obtained through solving a Ric- cati recurrence relation. This reasoning also extends to the dif- ferent phases of replication and degradation, allowing an exact generating function to be constructed for an arbitrary point in the bottleneck. Derivatives of this generating function are then used to obtain moments of the distributions of interest. The full procedure is given in Appendix 1. Recall that we assume that the bottlenecking process consists of a series of dynamic phases, which may either involve cycling cells (and hence cell divisions) or quiescent cells. The expression for mean mtDNA copy number E(m, (2) number of cell divisions in phase i(0 for quiescent phases), iis the length of a cell cycle in cycling phase i,0 iis the time spent in quiescent phase i(0 for cycling phases),and=i(nii+0 i), so that t\u0000is the time since the last cell division. E(m, t) is thus intuitively interpretable as a product of the initial copy number with the e ects of halving at each cell division, and the copy number evolution through past and current cell cycles and quiescent phases. The expression for the variance is lengthier, taking a lengthy, though algebraically simple, function of all physical parameters, which we derive and present in Ap- pendix 1. Once the means and variances associated with mu- tant and wild-type mtDNAs have been determined (for brevity, we write these as \u00b51E(m1,t),\u00002 1V(m1,t) and \u00b52 E(m2,t),\u00002 2V(m2,t)), the relations E(h)=\u00b52 2 The predicted mean heteroplasmy at time tas- suming a constant selective pressure (though this assumption can straightforwardly be relaxed) is given by Eqn. 4, which, given Eqn. 2, straightforwardly reduces to h0e\u0000\u0000\u0000t, (6) where h0is initial heteroplasmy and \u0000\u0000is the increase (or decrease, if negative) in replication rate of mutant over wild- type mtDNA. Eqn. 6 predicts that mean heteroplasmy in the presence of selection will follow a sigmoidal form (as expected from population dynamics [63], by the constraint that h0must lie between 0 and 1, and by the intuitive fact that heteroplasmy changes slow down as these limits are approached). Threshold crossing. The probability of heteroplasmy ex- ceeding a certain threshold his simply given by integrating the probability distribution of heteroplasmy between hand 1. The exact distribution of heteroplasmy can be written as a sum over hypergeometric functions; however, for computational ef- ciency and interpretability, we employ an approximation to this distribution involving the truncated Normal distribution and xation probabilities. As shown in Appendix 1, the distri- bution of heteroplasmy, taking possible xation into account, can be well approximated by P(h)=( 1 \u00001\u00002)N0(h|\u00b5,\u00002)+1\u0000(h)+2\u0000(h\u00001) (7) where N0is the truncated Normal distribution (truncated at 0 and 1), \u00b5and\u00002are found numerically given our model results for E(h) and V(h), and 1P(h= 0) and 2P(h= 1) are xation probabilities, also straightforwardly calculable from our model. The probability of threshold crossing for 0 <h<1 is then 9P(h>h)=( 1 \u00001\u00002) from heteroplasmy measurements.

(A) The mtDNA bottleneck acts to produce a population of oocytes with varying heteroplasmies from a single initial oocyte with a specic heteroplasmy value. During development, mtDNA copy number per cell decreases (by a debated amount, which we address; see Main Text) then recovers, suggesting a 'bottleneck' of cellular mtDNA populations. (B) Cellular mtDNA popula- tions during the bottleneck are modelled as containing wild- type and mutant mtDNAs. MtDNAs can replicate and degrade within a cell cycle, with rates \u0000andrespectively. (C) At cell divisions, the mtDNA population is partitioned between two daughter cells either deterministically, binomially, or through the binomial partitioning of mtDNA clusters.

As the threshold decreases, forcing a stricter agreement with experiment (thinner, darker columns), support converges on the birth-death-partitioning (BDP) model. Figure 3.

Note: the range in (B) does not correspond to a credibility interval on individual measurements, but rather on an expected underlying (population) variance, from which individual vari- ance measurements are sampled. We thus expect to see, for example, several measurements lower than this range due to sampling limitations (see text). (C) Posterior distributions on mtDNA turnover with time.

(A) There is most statistical support for a bottlenecking mechanism whereby mtDNA dynamics is stochas- tic within a cell cycle, involving random replication and degra- dation of mtDNA, and mtDNAs are binomially partitioned at divisions. (B) This mechanism results in heteroplasmy vari- ance increasing both due to stochastic partitioning at divisions and due to random turnover. The absolute magnitude of the copy number bottleneck is not critical: a range of bottleneck sizes can give rise to observed dynamics.

These data are taken from Tables 1 and 2 of Ref. [1] (labelled 'Cao'); Tables 1 and 2 of Ref. [2]; Fig. 1 of Ref. [3] and Fig. 1 of the following correspondence (reply to Ref. [4]) (labelled 'Wai'); and Table 2 of Ref. [5] (labelled 'Jenuth'). Convention in the literature suggests that normalisation of measured heteroplasmy variance values, performed by division by a factor h(1\u0000h), allows comparison of variance values from lines with diverse absolute heteroplasmies: the Wai data from correspondence is already normalised, and we manually normalised the Jenuth data using thehvalues present. Where data in the original studies were presented as a function of number of cells in a developing organism, as opposed to an explicit function of time, we have assigned times using the 7h !16h doubling times from Ref. [6]. Other sources assume a 15h doubling time throughout early development: using the data interpreted in this way did not lead to a qualitative di erence in our conclusions and very little quantitative change in posterior distributions (data not shown). Some datapoints did not have associated or readily available sample sizes N: for these datapoints we estimated Nusing available evidence in the publication. To check for dependence on these values of Nwe performed our inference process with a range of alternative Nvalues and with a test case where Nwas set to 100 for every datapoint: all results and posteriors were qualitatively similar, showing a lack of strong dependence of our conclusions on the specic numbers of samples involved in deriving the experimental measurements (data not shown). 2 Heteroplasmic and homoplasmic clusters The specic units of inheritance of mtDNA have been debated in the literature for decades. The smallest possible unit of inheritance is a single mtDNA molecule; some studies have hypothesised that the unit of inheritance consists of groups of mtDNA molecules. Within this picture, debate exists as to whether these groups are semi-permanent associations of molecules (which we will refer to as 'quenched' sets) or more fluid transient colocalisations of molecules (which we refer to as 'unquenched'). Furthermore, the size of these units is debated, with estimates ranging from an average size of 1.4 to 10 mtDNA molecules [7, 8], and it is unknown whether the mtDNAs within a group are strictly homoplasmic or if heteroplasmic groups are possible, although current evidence, at the nest resolution, points towards homoplasmic groups of size <2 [9, 10, 11, 12]. We will classify these di erent pictures with three parameters. First, the characteristic size cof an mtDNA group. Second, a classier denoting whether these groups are quenched (in the sense that the individual constituents of a group remain the same over many cell divisions) or unquenched (in the sense that the individual constituents of a group may change between cell divisions). Third, a classier denoting whether groups are necessarily homoplasmic, or if heteroplasmy is permitted. 1Time / dpc E(m) N Source 46 6.5e4 20 Wai4Time / dpc V0(h) N Source study 7.5 5.2e-6 12 Jenuth5 7.5 0.008 Jenuth5 Table Source data used in this study.1Data referenced by number of cells post-conception is assigned a time measurement assuming the 7h !16h doubling times from Ref.

[13] considered 'nucleoids' which correspond to quenched heteroplasmic groups with c>1, retaining their internal structure across cell divisions and containing di erent mtDNA types. If the mitochondrial organelle is the unit of inheritance, we may expect unquenched heteroplasmic groups with c>1, as mitochondrial dynamics act to mix the content of the mitochondrial system between cell divisions, but organelles are likely to contain more than one mtDNA molecule. If nucleoids are the units of inheritance and, as current understanding suggests, nucleoids are small and homoplasmic (if mtDNA indeed exists in groups at all), the appropriate picture is c'1, homoplasmic groups. Here we show that the heteroplasmy statistics resulting from these di erent pictures of grouped inheritance collapse onto two representative cases: rst, that corresponding to homoplasmic clusters with c>1, and second, that corresponding to c=1 (binomial inheritance). Quenching - whether mtDNA content can remix within nucleoids - is shown to be unimportant in determining heteroplasmy statistics. Our model for these di erent situations is as follows. We consider a cellular population as consisting of a set of mtDNA molecules, existing in groups of size c. During a cell cycle, the population of groups doubles deterministically (we ignore random birth-death dynamics in this model, in order to focus on partitioning dynamics), so that every group produces one exact copy of itself. For unquenched simulations, a new set of groups is then formed by resampling the individual mtDNA constituents of the cell. For quenched simulations (representing the situation postulated in Ref. [13]), the existing groups remain intact. At cell divisions, groups are binomially partitioned between the two daughter cells. The model is initialised with a cell containing m0mtDNAs, split into (1 \u0000h)m0wild-type and hm 0mutant molecules. These mtDNAs are clustered into m0/cgroups, according to the cluster picture under consideration (i.e. homoplasmic or heteroplasmic clusters). We simulate the subsequent doubling then partitioning of this system through cell divisions many times, assuming a constant cell cycle length, and record the cell-to-cell heteroplasmy variance with time. Fig. 1 shows the variance trajectories for di erent cases (with h0=0.1; other initial heteroplasmies showed similar behaviour). The rst striking result is that the inheritance of heteroplasmic groups produces the same hetero- plasmy variance as binomial partitioning, regardless of cluster size. This behaviour is due to the balance between stochasticity associated with the makeup of, and partitioning of, groups. A small number of large groups will experience substantial parti- tioning noise, but larger heteroplasmic groups are more likely to faithfully represent the overall cell heteroplasmy. As identied in Ref. [13], the inheritance of heteroplasmic groups thus provides a means to facilitate local mtDNA complementation while provoking no increase in heteroplasmy variance beyond that associated with binomial partitioning of elements at divisions. We also observe that quenched populations behave in the same way as unquenched populations. In the case of homoplasmic groups, this result is obvious, as a set of homoplasmic nucleoids of a given size can only be constructed in one way for a given number of mtDNA molecules of di erent types. For heteroplasmic groups, this result implies that resampling the cellular population to produce a new group produces a negligible amount of additional stochasticity compared to that already present in the random makeup and inheritance of groups. Thus, the only determinant factors of heteroplasmy variance related to the inheritance of groups are whether groups are homoplasmic or heteroplasmic, and, if the former, the characteristic size of groups. These results illustrate that the binomial inheritance model can also describe the statistics associated with heteroplasmic nucleoids of arbitrary size, over a timescale of several dozen cell divisions (suitable to describe the developmental process). The theoretical long-term behaviour of these systems involves some more subtleties. At much longer times, the probability that all mtDNA types become extinct in a cell is not negligible. When complete extinction cannot be ignored, heteroplasmy statistics become poorly dened. This extinction timescale is shorter for cluster inheritance than for binomial inheritance, as a greater variability in copy number (though not in heteroplasmy) results from each division for larger clusters. However, our simulations indicate that as long as the heteroplasmy variance associated with heteroplasmic clusters remains well dened, it matches that resulting from binomial inheritance. We propose that a reasonable view may be that individual mitochondrial fragments, including several small, homoplasmic nucleoids, are the likely elements of inheritance at partitioning. Furthermore, there is likely some movement of these nucleoids within the mitochondrial network, and ssion and fusion likely mean that a given mtDNA will not be associated with the same static mitochondrial element in perpetuity. In this case, the picture of an unquenched, heteroplasmic group of mtDNAs - those contained within a discrete element of the mitochondrial system - seems most reasonable. We can thus speculate that, as demonstrated by the previous results, the precise size of mitochondrial fragments at partitioning is not important for the heteroplasmy dynamics (nor indeed is whether they are quenched or unquenched). Our simple binomial partitioning model is thus consistent with what one might consider the most physiologically plausible model, and indeed with any models not involving large and strictly homoplasmic groups as the elements of mitochondrial inheritance. 3 Parametric inference for bottlenecking dynamics Our model is a function of the parameter set1={i,\u0000i,ni,i,S ,,T,c ,h 0,m0,\u0000\u0000}. For the following parameters we use uninformative uniform priors on the given interval: \u0000i,i2[0,1]hr\u00001;S2{0,1};2[0.005,1];T2[0,100]day; c2[0,100]; h02 1For reference, the meanings of these parameters are (as in Fig. 1D in the Main Text): replication ( \u0000i)a n dd e g r a d a t i o n( i)r a t e s ;n u m b e ro fc e l l divisions ( ni)a n dc e l lc y c l el e n g t h( i)i ne a c hd y n a m i cp h a s e i;d e t e r m i n i s t i co rs t o c h a s t i cd y n a m i c sl a b e l( S=0,1r e s p e c t i v e l y ) ;ap r o p o r t i o n of mtDNAs capable of replication after threshold time T;d e t e r m i n i s t i c( c=0 ) ,b i n o m i a l( c=1 )o rc l u s t e r e d( c>1) partitioning at divisions; initial heteroplasmy h0and initial copy number m0;\u0000\u0000is an additional parameter allowing a possible di erence in replicative rates between mutant and wildtype mtDNA: this is zero unless otherwise stated. 300.010.020.030.04 cs cs = 16Hetero, U, cs = 4Hetero, Q, cs = 4Hetero, U, cs = 16Hetero, Q, cs = 16Figure 1: Heteroplasmy variance in a model system under several di erent group-inheritance regimes.

Groups may be quenched (Q; constituents remain the same across cell divisions) or unquenched (UQ; constituents are randomly resampled from the cellular population each cell cycle); for homoplasmic clusters, an unquenched protocol yields identical results to the quenched protocol.

[0,1];m02[0,106]. The following values are xed after development; h0=0.2 is xed as an intermediate value as heteroplasmy variance measurements are generally normalised; \u0000\u0000, a parameter allowing a di erence in replicative rates between mutant and wildtype mtDNAs, is xed at zero throughout as we ignore selective pressure. The parameter ifori>2 is used to determine the length of time spent in di erent quiescent phases and is subject to the uniform prior i2[0,50]day. Given these priors, we use an approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) approach to build a posterior distribution over the parameters in our bottlenecking model [15]. ABC involves using a summary statistic (,D) to compare the available data Dto the predictions of a model given parameters . If parameter sets are sampled from the set for which ,w h e r e is a threshold dierence between the resulting model behaviour and experimental data, the posterior distribution P(|(,D)) is sampled, which is argued to su \u0000ciently approximate P(|D) for suitably small [16]. We dene a residual sum-of-squares di erence between the results of a simulated model data. We thus amalgamate experimental results of two types: mean mtDNA copy number (with Nmdata points measuring ED(m) times D,m), and mean and variance of (with Nhdata points measuring VD(h) at times t(i) D,h). The sets of data for E(m) and V(h) contain di erent numbers of points and are of di erent absolute magnitudes. We compensate for these di erences by using the logarithms of copy number measurements (as these values span several orders of magnitude), and weighting parameter A1= 103. This weighting parameter compensates for the di erent magnitudes and number of datapoints in each class of measurement, ensuring that the contribution to the total residual from each set of data is of comparable magnitude. Our summary statistic thus records a residual sum-of-squares di erence between experiment and simulation values for log E(m) and V(h) at each time point where an experimental measurement exists. We performed our model selection process using several di erent alternative protocols, including comparing logarithms of V(h) measurements (in contrast to the raw values) and varying A1over orders of magnitude from 102\u0000104(corresponding to unbalanced weighting, favouring E(m) and V(h) data respectively). In all cases, the BDP model identied in the Main Text experienced substantially more support than any alternative. For inference involving the new dataset from the HB model system, we use the default protocol above and set A1=3103to account for the threefold decrease in available V0(h) datapoints. We use an MCMC implementation of ABC, whereby we construct a Markov chain i, where each state consists of a set of trial parameters to be assessed. We create i+1by perturbing each parameter within iwith a perturbation kernel consisting of a Normal distribution on each parameter with standard deviations between 0 .1\u00001% of the width of the prior (varied as the model depends more sensitively on some parameters than others). In the case of discrete parameter c, a continuous representation c0is used and varied in the MCMC approach, with c=b100c0c. We accept i+1as the new state of the chain if (i+1,D).W e ran 106MCMC iterations for ABC model selections and checked convergence by running ve instances of each simulation for 400.050.10.150.20.250.30.350.40.45 00.511.522.533.54P(residual)E(m) residual\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002\u0001\u0003\u0001\u0004 00.10.20.30.40.50.6 erent ABC thresholds .The distribution of individual squared residuals between an ensemble of simulated trajectories and experimental datapoints for (top) log E(m) (bottom) V(h).

For the initial optimisation of model tting, we ran 106MCMC steps using the protocol above but accepting a move according to the Metropolis-Hastings protocol [18], recording the parameterisation leading to the lowest recorded residual. In this case we used uninformative initial conditions, with identical choices for all rate parameters, corresponding to an inaccurate trajectory of copy number and heteroplasmy variance. For model selection, we used the protocol above, with a di erent set of parameters M for each model M, with each MCMC step proposing a random model from the Cao alone, Wai alone, and BDP set described in the text, as in the SMC ABC model selection protocol proposed in Ref. [15]. We record the proportion of accepted steps involving each model type. The parameterisations found through initial optimisation were used as initial conditions in the ABC model selection and inference simulations. Initial optimisation identied parameterisations all displaying residuals under = 50. We chose ={45,50,60,75}for the ABC model selection simulations to display the varying degrees of support for each model as stricter agreement with experiment was enforced. We chose = 40 for the ABC inference of BDP model parameterisation to ensure these models all displayed better ts to data than the alternative models. In Fig. 2 we illustrate the distribution of squared residuals for the BDP model under a range of values. 4 Posteriors for all variables and datasets In Fig. 3 we display all posterior distributions for all parameters resulting from our ABC approach assuming the BDP model. There is substantial variability in the possible timescales and magnitudes of random turnover associated with each random dynamic phase i>2, exemplied by the complicated and bimodal structure of the posteriors on these parameters. This variability reflects the fact that an increase in heteroplasmy variance can be achieved through a variety of specic mtDNA trajectories, and current experimental data is insu \u0000cient to distinguish specic time behaviours within this variety. However, the total contribution of each random phase to the overall dynamics is more constrained, as shown in the posterior distribution on a measure of total random turnover \u0000=P6 i=30 ii. This quantity is the sum over all later phases of the product of the length of that phase and the rate of random turnover, thus giving a measure of total random turnover. The fact that this posterior is more tightly constrained than the posteriors on individual ti,iparameters suggests that the required mtDNA turnover can be achieved through a range of specic dynamic trajectories from the inferred mechanism: for example, the model parameters. The posterior distributions on individual model parameters, assuming the inferred BDP bottlenecking mechanism. Replication rates are presented as =\u0000\u0000, thus representing overall proliferation rates of mtDNA. Units are omitted for clarity. Pale, single-values distributions correspond to parameter values xed within the model ( 6= 0 mtDNA proliferation after development; 1= 16hr xed by data on xed for simplicity as heteroplasmy variances are normalised; \u0000\u0000= 0 xed to avoid varying selective pressure). The 'turnover' parameter, described in the text, isP6 i=30 ii, a measure of the total random turnover in the mtDNA population. 6random mtDNA turnover sharply increases is currently flexible (though constrained to lie around 25 dpc) without more detailed data. This flexibility is also observed in the trajectories of posterior distributions in the main text. 5 Experimental measurements Table 2 contains the measurements of heteroplasmy h, mean heteroplasmy datapoints n, from the HB model system. Experimental procedures are described in Methods; and an ARMS assay. Master-mixes for triplicate qPCR reactions (Solis BioDyne, Estonia); 4.5 MgCl2 for the ARMS and the Co3 consensus assays, and 3.5 mM MgCl2 for the Co2 consensus assay; 200 M of each of the four deoxynucleotides (dNTPs, Solis BioDyne, Estonia), HOT FIREPol DNA polymerase according to the manufacturers instructions (Solis BioDyne, Estonia), 300 nM of each primer and 100 nM hydroloysis probe (Sigma-Aldrich, Austria). Per reaction 12 \u00b5L of master-mix and 3 \u00b5L DNA were transferred in triplicates to 384-well PCR plates (Life Technologies, Austria) using the automated pipetting system epMotion 5075TMX (Eppendorf, Germany). Amplication was performed Real-Time PCR System using the ViiATM7 Software v1.1 (Life Technologies, USA). DNA denaturation and enzyme activation were performed for 15 min at 95oC. DNA was amplied over 40 cycles consisting of 95oC for 20 sec, 58oC for 20 sec and 72oC for 40 sec for both assays. The standard curve method was applied. Amplication e \u0000ciencies were determined for each run separately by DNA dilution series consisting of DNA from wild-derived mice, harbouring the 0.87, 0.90; and Y-intercept = 32.2, 28.3, 33.8, 34.5; for the consensus Co2, consensus Co3, C57BL/6N and HB assays respectively. Coe \u0000cient of correlation was >0.99 in all assays in all runs. All target samples lay within the linear interval of the standard curves. To test for specicity, in each run a negative control sample, i.e. a DNA sample of a mouse harbouring the mtDNA of the non-analysed type in the heteroplasmic mouse (i.e. C57BL/6N or HB mtDNA) was measured. All assays could discriminate between C57BL/6N and HB mtDNA at a minimum level of 0.2%. Target sample DNA was tested for inhibition by dilution in Tris-EDTA bu er (Sigma-Aldrich, Austria), pH 8.0. 6 Bottlenecking mechanisms and further experimental elucidation Here we summarise potential mechanisms for the bottleneck that conflict with our statistical interpretation, highlighting the reasons for the conflict. We also propose further experiments that would e \u0000ciently provide more evidence to distinguish these hypotheses. 6.1 Other proposed mechanisms Random partitioning of homoplasmic mtDNA clusters. Ref. [2] suggests a less powerful depletion of mtDNA copy number during early development than assumed by other studies, with heteroplasmy variance increase instead being explained by the partitioning of clusters of mtDNA at cell divisions. However, the time period over which Refs. [3] and [5] observe increasing heteroplasmy variance corresponds to a situation in which germ line cells are largely quiescent, immediately suggesting that partitioning at cell divisions cannot explain increasing variance (as cell divisions do not occur). Furthermore, results from our model suggest that, unless these clusters are very small, this mechanism would immediately lead to a rather higher and sharper increase in heteroplasmy variance than observed. Replication of a specic subset of mtDNAs during folliculogenesis. Ref. [3] proposes a mechanism in which only a subset of mtDNAs replicate during folliculogenesis. There are several specic dynamic schemes by which this mechanism could be manifest.

Heteroplasmy measurements and statistics from the HB model system. Ages are given in days after birth. 8folliculogenesis, a specic subset of mtDNAs in each cell is 'marked' as able to replicate (we next consider the case in which this subset is more plastic with time). In this case, the e ect of 'switching o ' replication of a subset of mtDNAs depends on the balance of replication and degradation rates of the mtDNA population: Low replication, low degradation. In this case, the population stays largely static; the switching o of replication has little eect, and the heteroplasmy variance cannot increase to the levels observed in experiment. Low replication, high degradation. In this case, the high degradation rate ensures that the non-replicating mtDNAs are removed from the cell, providing a 'bottleneck' as only the replicating mtDNAs remain. However, this regime yields a transient period of mtDNA copy number depletion, while the non-replicating mtDNAs are degrading but the (small) population of replicating agents remains low. This copy number depletion is not observed. High replication, high degradation. In this case, non-replicating mtDNAs are removed and replicating mtDNAs are capable of fast enough replication to survive the transient drop in copy number. However, the rates associated with this mechanism are necessarily high enough such that the increase in heteroplasmy variance is very sharp, notably more so than the smooth increase with time observed in experiment (see, for example, Fig. 2A in the Main Text). Combined subset replication, and/or heteroplasmic cluster inheritance, with and random dynamics. Our approach does not provide support against a model combining our inferred mechanism (increased random turnover of mtDNAs) with some other dynamic schemes, namely (a) that in which only a subset of mtDNAs may replicate during folliculogenesis, and/or (b) where heteroplasmic mtDNA clusters, rather than individual mtDNAs, are the units of inheri- tance. A combination with (a) would allow the reduction of the key parameters associated with each: so the rate of random turnover could be lower, and the proportion of replicating genomes larger, than in the case of the pure incarnations of those respective mechanisms. This scheme may thus provide a viable alternative - however, it requires an introduction of two coupled mechanisms, which experimental data currently cannot disambiguate. For this reason and for parsimony, we report the case where random dynamics alone are responsible, and below suggest experimental protocols to further elucidate this possible link or its absence. A combination with (b) is possible and cannot be discounted using the available data, as the trajectories of heteroplasmy variance under (b) and under binomial inheritance are the same. We propose observations of mitochondrial ultrastructure and mtDNA localisation during development to resolve this remaining mechanistic question. 6.2 Observation of a subset of replicating genomes Ref. [3] performs BrU labelling to observe the proportion of mitochondria replicating in primary oocytes between P1-4 (21-25 dpc on our time axis). The observations contained therein (Fig. 2 in Ref. [3]) show a small subset of BrU-labelled mitochondrial foci compared to the overall population of mitochondria labelled with another dye. Here we show that this observation is compatible with (and expected from) our proposed model of random mtDNA turnover. Consider a population of mtDNAs replicating with rate \u0000and degrading with rate . We model the BrU labelling assay as follows. At time t= 0, we begin the BrU labelling, which we conservatively model as a perfect process, so that every mtDNA that replicates becomes labelled. We continue this labelling until t=t, when we observe the proportion of labelled mtDNAs. For simplicity, we will consider a xed population of mtDNAs of size N, though this reasoning extends to changing population size. We denote by lthe number of labelled mtDNAs. After BrU exposure, this number may change in three ways: (A) a replication event involving a previously unlabelled mtDNA will produce two new labelled mtDNAs; (B) a replication event involving a previously labelled mtDNA will produce one new labelled mtDNA; (C) a degradation event involving a labelled mtDNA will remove one labelled mtDNA. The dynamics of labelled mtDNA number during BrU exposure are given by dl dt=(A)+( B)+( C) (2) =2\u0000(N\u0000l)+\u0000l\u0000l (3) Assuming that l= 0 at t= 0, the solution of this equation, for the number of labelled mtDNAs at time t,i s l=2N\u0000 \u0000+ 1\u0000e\u0000(\u0000+)t (4) Assuming a constant population size requires \u0000=. The conclusions of this illustrative study do not substantially change if we allow ( \u00006=) and hence an increasing or decreasing population. We consider the values of \u0000andrequired to yield values oflcomparable with those found in Ref. [3]. We will roughly estimate these values, based on the proportion of labelled foci observable, as l=0.5Nfor 24h BrU exposure (half of being l=0.05Nfor 2h BrU exposure (5% of and after cell divisions and/or variance of copy number between daughter cellsTo elucidate mechanism of mtDNA partitioning and whether this partitioning is deterministic or stochastic.

Table 3: Experiments for further elucidation of the mtDNA bottleneck. Fig. 3D in our Main Text gives the posterior distribution on , characterising the rate of random mtDNA turnover in our model, at di erent times. It can be seen that a value of =0.35 day\u00001comfortably falls within the region of high posterior density during the time range 21-25 d.p.c - lying immediately before the strong increase in random turnover that our model subsequently predicts. Our inferred mechanism of random mtDNA turnover is thus compatible with the observations of a labelled subset of mtDNAs in the BrU incorporation assay in Ref. [3] - we would expect to see roughly the observed labelling proportion simply due to the likely rates of random mtDNA turnover inferred at that stage of development. Furthermore, we can use this line of reasoning to produce a testable prediction: similar experiments carried out several days later - when random mtDNA turnover is inferred to increase substantially - should show a larger subset of labelled mtDNAs for the same BrU exposure. 6.3 Experimental elucidation In Table 3 we list several classes of potential experimental protocols that would assist in further elucidation of the bottlenecking mechanism and our predictions. Potentially useful results include further characterisation of the microscopic detail underlying mtDNA dynamics during development, conrmation of our random turnover model, assessing degree to which heteroplasmy modulates copy number dynamics and exploring our predictions relating mitophagy and bottlenecking power. 7 Mitophagy regulation The results from our model suggest a potential clinical pathway for increasing heteroplasmy variance, and thus the power of the bottleneck to remove heteroplasmic cells. We have shown that upregulation of mtDNA degradation (for example, through increasing mitophagy) leads to lower mtDNA copy numbers and greater heteroplasmy variance. It is unclear whether a given treatment will have the sole e ect of upregulating mitophagy: it seems likely that compensatory mechanisms (which we do not explicitly model, but may include retrograde signalling [19]) will engage to stabilise mtDNA copy number. However, such mechanisms would most straightforwardly be expected to act through increasing mtDNA proliferation, thus having the net eect of increasing mtDNA turnover. We have shown that such an increase in turnover also increases the heteroplasmy variance in a population. We therefore propose that upregulating mitophagy may be a fruitful pathway of investigation for increasing bottlenecking power, either as a standalone e ect or due to the action of compensatory mechanisms it may invoke. Speculatively, potential strategies to upregulate mitophagy may include the limited use of uncouplers to accelerate the mitophagy normally involved in quality control [20]; targetted chemical treatments with agents that have been identied as regulating mitophagy, including glutathione in yeast [21] and C 18-pyridium human cancer cells and dynamics to to the process of mitophagy [23, 24]; or the use of existing drugs which have been found to modulate mitophagy, such as Efavirenz [25]. 108 Heteroplasmy statistics heteroplasmy by h=M2 M1+M2. (5) To nd statistics for this quantity we consider the Taylor expansion of a function f(X1,X2) of two random variables X1,X2 about a point ( \u00b51,\u00b52), where \u00b5i=E(Xi). We assume that the moments of Xiare well-dened and both have zero probability mass at Xi= 0. The Taylor expansion is: f(X1,X2)=f(\u00b51,\u00b52)+f1(\u00b51,\u00b52)(X1\u0000\u00b51)+f2(\u00b51,\u00b52)(X2\u0000\u00b52) + higher order terms , (6) where fidenotes the derivative of fwith respect to Xi. We truncate the expansion at rst order for later algebraic simplicity, noting that even with this level of precision, the agreement between the resulting analysis and numerical simulation is excellent. Then E(f(X1,X2)) = E(f(\u00b51,\u00b52)+f1(\u00b51,\u00b52)(X1\u0000\u00b51)+f2(\u00b51,\u00b52)(X2\u0000\u00b52)+...). (7) We note that E(Xi\u0000\u00b5i) = 0, so E(f(X1,X2))'f(\u00b51,\u00b52). (8) Similarly, V(f(X1,X2)) = E((f(X1,X2)\u0000E(f(X1,X2)))2) (9) 'E((f(X1,X2)\u0000f(\u00b51,\u00b52))2) (10) =E((f1(\u00b51,\u00b52)(X1\u0000\u00b51)+f2(\u00b51,\u00b52)(X2\u0000\u00b52))2), and noting E((Xi\u0000\u00b5i)2)=V(Xi) we obtain V(f(X1,X2))'(f1(\u00b51,\u00b52))2V(X1)+( f2(\u00b51,\u00b52))2V(X2)+2 (12) where C(X1,X2) is the covariance of X2.I fw en o wu s e f(X1,X2)=X1 X2,w eh a v e M1and M2are independent (due to the lack of coupling between the mtDNA species), of analytic results for binomial model Generating function within a cell cycle. To make analytic progress describing the mitochondrial content of quiescent cells, and within a single cell cycle of dividing cells, we use a birth and death model to describe mitochondrial evolution. Without cell divisions, the dynamics of a population of replicating and degrading entities is given by the master equation dP(m, t) dt=(m+ 1)P(m+1,t)+\u0000(m\u00001)P(m\u00001,t)\u0000(+\u0000)mP(m, t), (17) P(m,0) = \u0000mm 0, (18) 11with P(m) the probability of observing the system with a copy number mat time t, and m0the initial copy number. The corresponding generating function, using the transformation G(z,t)=P mzmP(m, t), obeys @G(z,t) dt=((1\u0000z)+\u0000(z2\u0000z))@G(z,t) @z(19) (z\u00001)\u0000e(\u0000\u0000)t\u0000\u0000z+m0 (21) [g(z,t)]m0, (22) where the 0 subscript signies that no divisions have occurred, and we have specically labelled the base of G0asg0for later convenience. Generating function over cell divisions. We now consider a system undergoing cell divisions. Now, we have a population of organelles with time evolution described by a generating function G=[g]m0and subject to binomial partitioning at cell division. The probability distribution of mafter a single the number of individuals after and before the ith cell division, and the subscript in P0 denotes the fact that this function refers to time evolution within a cell cycle (with no division). The sum takes into account all possible congurations of the system up to the cell division then all possible congurations afterwards, with weighting according to a binomial partitioning. This line of reasoning can straightforwardly be \u0000i=mi,b mi,a 2\u0000mi,bP0(mi,b,|mi+1,a), i,j1X mi,b=0mi,bX 0X n\u00001,1z }| { Comparing Eqns. 29 and 32 and following this process by induction we can see that the overall generating function is Gn=hm0 0,w h e r e his the solution to the recursive system hi=g01 2+hi+1 2, (33) hn=g0(z,t). (34) hiis of the formahi+1+b chi+1+d(from Eqn. 21). This expression takes the form of a Riccati di erence equation and can be solved exactly after Ref. [27]. The solution is straightforward but algebraically lengthy, and we defer presentation of the full procedure to a future technical publication. The overall solution is: GC(z,t,n )=h0=2n(l\u00002)(\u0000z\u0000)+l0(z\u00001)((\u0000(2n\u0000ln)\u0000ln(l\u00002))) \u0000l0(z\u00001)(2n+ln\u0000ln+1)+2n(l\u00002)(\u0000z\u0000)(35) where the Csubscript denotes l=e(\u0000\u0000)(36) l0=e(\u0000\u0000)t(37) Generating function for di erent phases. We now consider how to extend this reasoning to the overall bottlenecking process, which in general may involve several phases of quiescent and cycling dynamics with di erent kinetic parameters. We begin with the generating function bases gi(z,t) for each regime i. For consistency with the above approach, we label phases starting from a zero index, so the rst phase corresponds to i= 0, and we use imaxto denote the label of the nal phase. Then we use himax=gi(z,t) (38) hi=gi(hi+1,0) (39) Goverall =hm0 0, (40) using induction over the di erent phases in the way we used induction over di erent cell cycles above. Here we consider the changeover between regimes by using the generating function at the start of the incoming phase. The appropriate generating function bases for quiescent (Eqn. 21) and cycling (Eqn. 35) cells can be 13gQ(z,t|m0)=AQz+BQ CQz+DQ (50) using, as before, l=e(\u0000\u0000)and l0=e(\u0000\u0000)t. Note that the cycling coe \u0000cients reduce to the quiescent coe \u0000cients when n!0 and !0. The values of the appropriate A, B, C, D coe\u0000cients for a given dynamic phase thus follow straightforwardly from the kinetic parameters of that phase, with the appropriate choice between quiescent and cycling parameters being made. If we now label these coe \u0000cients with a subscript denoting the appropriate phase of bottlenecking, so that, for example, Ai is Eqn. 47 bottlenecking and simplifying the resultant multi-layer fraction gives rise to the solution Eqns. 43-46 can be thought of as special cases of Eqns. 47-50, we combine Eqns. 47-50 into Eqn. 55, nd i2ni(li\u00002)(\u0000i\u0000i) (59) A0D0\u0000B0C0=Y + A0(2C0+D0(1\u0000m0)))Q i4ni(li\u00002)2(\u0000i\u0000i)2E(m)+E(m)\u0000E(m)2(63) leaving us only with the problem of calculating the expression ( B0C0(m0+ 1) + A0(2C0+D0(1\u0000m0))) in the variance calculation. We were not able to dramatically simplify this expression and so, for clarity, write: \u0000=\u0000(B0C0(m0+ 1) + A0(2C0+D0(1\u0000m0))), (64) which gives us: V(m)=\u0000E(m)Q (65) We note that \u0000is just a simplication and is straightforwardly calculable by inserting Eqns. 47-50 into Eqn. 55 then computing Eqn. 64. Constant population size. For generality, we consider enforcing a constant population size in post-mitotic cells (not undergoing divisions). This process involves setting \u0000=, so the net gain in mtDNA is zero. If we write \u0000=+and take the limit !0, Eqn. 21 becomes Gc,post(z,t)=tz\u0000z\u0000t tz\u00001\u0000tm0 . (66) To enforce a constant mean population size in mitotic cells, it is necessary to balance the expected loss of mtDNA through repeated divisions with an expected increase during the cell cycle. This balance can be accomplished by setting \u0000=+ln 2 . Writing \u0000=+ln 2 +and taking the Gc,mito(z,t)=2(z\u00001)\u00002t/(z\u00001) 2)+n1ln 2) + 2) + zln 4m0 . (67) In both these cases, the same approach as above can be used to derive moments of the resulting probability distributions. Explicit distributions. The probability of observing exactly mmtDNAs of a given type can be found from the generating function with P(m, t)=1 m!@m @zmG(z,t)\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 z=0. (68) We can use Leibniz' on a generating function of form G= A0z+B0 P(m, t)=1 P(h)=1X m1=01X m2=0P(m1,t|(1\u0000h0)m0)P(m2,t|h0m0)Im2 m1+m2,h , (72) where I(h0,h) is an indicator function returning 1 if h0=hand 0 otherwise. Computing the probability of observing a given heteroplasmy thus involves a sum, over all mtDNA states that correspond to that heteroplasmy, of the probability of that state. The evaluation of hypergeometric functions is more computationally demanding than that of more common mathematical functions, and the innite sums at rst glance seem intractable. However, in practise and using parameterisations from our inferential approach, vanishingly little probability density exists at m1,m2>5105, corresponding to the biological observation that mtDNA copy number is very unlikely to exceed this value. Dynamic programming then allows these sums to be performed straightforwardly. Finally, the computation of P(m=0,t) is important in our analysis of the characterisation of key distributions using the rst two moments (see below), where it appears as P(m2=0,t), the probability of wildtype xation. This is relatively straightforward to address analytically as when m= 0, Eqn. 68 reduces to P(0,t)=Goverall |z=0, which in the notation above is simply: P(0,t)=B0 D0m0 , (73) where we introduce the notation for xation probability for later brevity. We could not dramatically simplify the full expression so we leave it in this form and note that it can be readily calculated (as above) by inserting Eqns. 47-50 into Eqn. 55 then computing Eqn. 73. and heteroplasmy. The heteroplasmy h=m2/(m1+m2) is straightforwardly addressable by considering the above solutions for m1and m2. We can also consider a more general case, in which we have four species of mtDNA in our model: wildtype reproducing ( m1), mutant reproducing ( m3) and mutant sterile ( m4). We assume that these species evolve in an uncoupled way with time. The parameter h0, initial heteroplasmy, determines the initial proportion of mutant genomes: h0=m20+m40 m0,w h e r e m0=m10+m20+m30+m40is the total initial copy number of mtDNA. The parameter determines the proportion of genomes capable of reproducing: =m10 m10+m30=m20 m20+m40. We compute the trajectories for all mithen calculate heteroplasmy by setting M1=m1+m3,M2=m2+m4, respectively the total numbers of wildtype and mutant mtDNAs, and using Eqns. 15 and 16, where all means and variances are straightforwardly extracted from the above analysis. 10 Characterisation of distributions of important quantities with moments We are interested in the probability with which heteroplasmy hexceeds a certain threshold value h. This probability can be computed using Eqn. 72 above, but the large sums of hypergeometric functions suggest that a simpler approximation of the heteroplasmy distribution may be desirable, both for computational simplicity and intuitive interpretability. We here explore how well distributions of copy number and, importantly, heteroplasmy are characterised by quantities that are easily obtained from our analytic approaches without large summations: specically, low-order moments E(m),V(m), and xation probabilities P(m= 0). For moderate initial heteroplasmy 0 .7>h0>0.3, all distributions are well matched by the Normal distributions computed using the rst two moments E(m) and V(m). This match begins to fail as initial heteroplasmy decreases or increases to the extent where xation of one mtDNA type becomes likely. The resultant non-negligible probability density at h= 0 and/or h=1 represents a truncation point which forces skew on the distributions (particularly P(h)) and weakens the Normal approximation. We can make progress by considering P(h) to be a weighted sum of a truncated Normal distribution N0(\u00b5,\u00002) (truncated at 0, 1; and with currently unknown parameters \u00b5,\u0000) and two \u0000-functions at h= 0 and h= 1 representing the xation probability of wildtype and mutant mtDNA respectively. If we write PN0(h) for the probability density at hof such a truncated Normal distribution, we have: P(h)=( 1 \u00001\u00002)PN0(h)+1\u0000(h)+2\u0000(h\u00001), (74) where 1=P(m2=0,t) is the xation probability of the wildtype and 2=P(m1=0,t) is the xation probability of the mutant, expressions for which were computed previously in Eqn. 73. Knowledge of the parameters \u00b5,\u0000that describe the truncated Normal part of this distribution will then provide us with a better estimate of P(h). 16We can use the relations E(h)=R hP(h)dhand V(h)=R \u0000(h) provides a nonzero contribution to these integrals only when h= 0, the contribution from this part of P(h) is always zero; then, E(h)=Z h((1\u00001\u00002)PN0(h)+2\u0000(h\u00001))dh (75) \u00001\u00002)\u0000 V(Nh>0)+E(Nh>0)2\u0000 \u0000E(h)2+2 (78) where E(N0),V(N0) are respectively the mean and variance of the truncated Normal distribution, and in the nal line we have used the fact that V(N0)=R h2PN0(h)dh\u0000E(N0)2. Results are known [28] for 0 and 2)) are respectively the p.d.f. and c.d.f. of the standard Normal distribution. Given these expressions, we wish to invert these Eqns. 76 and 78 to nd \u00b5and \u0000, the parameters underlying the truncated Normal distribution, given E(h),V(h) and 1,2=P(m2,1= 0), which we can compute (see below). We have not been able to nd an analytic solution for these equations; however, numerically solving these equations is computationally far cheaper than performing the numeric simulations required to better characterise the real distribution. We then obtain an expression for P(h), which well matches the exact distribution derived using Eqn. 72 (see Fig. 4). Threshold crossing. The probability of crossing a threshold heteroplasmy hwith time is simply given by the probability density in the region h>h. We can then use the result P(h>h)=( 1 \u00001\u00002) 1\u00001 2 1 + erf (h\u0000\u00b5)/p 2\u00002 +1(1\u0000\u0000(h)) + 2(1\u0000\u0000(h\u00001)), (81) for threshold crossing, which follows straightforwardly from considering the integrated density of the model distribution (Eqn. 74) of habove h, with parts from the error function representing the denite integral of the truncated Normal part of the distribution, with additional terms from wildtype xation (if h6= 0) and mutant xation (if h6= 1). Inferring embryonic heteroplasmy. The probability that a sample measurement hmcame from an embryo with hetero- plasmy h0can be found from Bayes' Theorem: P(h0|hm)=P(hm|h0)P(h0) assume a uniform prior heteroplasmy (though this can be straightforwardly gener- alised). P(hm) is given by the integral over all possible embryonic heteroplasmies of making observation hm, the truncated Normal distribution are found numerically as above (for each h0 0value in the integrand, which is performed numerically); functions Comparison of Normal approximation with exact heteroplasmy distribution.
