They are trained to know which patients they can treat safely, and which ones they need to refer to other health care practitioners. The Healing Power of Nature Nature acts powerfully through healing mechanisms in the body and mind to maintain and restore health. Naturopathic doctors work to restore and support these inherent healing systems when they have broken down, by using methods, medicines, and techniques that are in harmony with natural processes. Identify and Treat the Cause(s) Every illness has an underlying cause, often in aspects of lifestyle, diet, or habits of the individual. A naturopathic doctor is trained to find and facilitate removal of the underlying cause of disease. Doctor as Teacher The original meaning of the word \"doctor\" was teacher. A principal objective of naturopathic medicine is to educate the patient and emphasize self-responsibility for health. Naturopathic doctors also recognize and employ the therapeutic potential of the doctor-patient relationship. Treat the Whole Person Health or disease comes from a complex interaction of physical, emotional, dietary, genetic, environmental, lifestyle, and other factors. Naturopathic doctors treat the whole person, taking these factors into account. Prevention The naturopathic approach to health care can prevent minor illnesses from developing into more serious or chronic degenerative diseases. Patients are taught the principles with which to live a healthy life; by following these principles they can prevent major illnesses. Classical Chinese Medicine uses acupuncture, Chinese herbs, and qi gong to bring the body back into balance. Chinese medicine is holistic, looking at the body, mind, and spirit as one. The medicine's philosophy is that symptoms relate to a disease pattern, and by treating the underlying pattern, health is restored. Hilary Back, ND, LAc, integrates both Chinese and naturopathic medical philosophies in her approach to healing, using the most appropriate modalities for each individual.
