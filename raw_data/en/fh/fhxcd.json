We are a growing K-6 Public Waldorf Independent Study Program with the goal of adding a grade each year, until we are a K-8. WISE is inspired by and works progressively out of Waldorf-based educational methods. The 2016/2017 school year is in our third year of operation at our beautiful Camp Bothin location. We are nestled in 152 acres of Marin Open Space, in Fairfax, California and our classrooms reside in historic buildings, a cozy red barn and custom yurts. | | | | Sophia Institute offers a variety of programs, courses, publications and other resources to anyone interested in Anthroposophy and Waldorf/Steiner inspired education. Currently there are students from all over the world enrolled in the Sophia Institute "}
