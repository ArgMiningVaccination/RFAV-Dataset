Special Events & Ceremonies I work with 19 beautiful and completely unique bowls, hand-picked and assembled into two one-of-a-kind sets: ENDOCRINE SYSTEM SET The Endocrine System is the point at which energy becomes chemistry. A foundational network of glands, this system sends messages throughout the entire body and plays an integral part in homeostasis (internal balance of bodily systems). If the endocrine system is acute and functioning properly, the entire body reaps extraordinary benefits! When we use the bowls to balance and tune at the endocrine level, the entire body falls into sync. Especially beneficial for: - Growth and Development - Homeostasis (Achieving Balance and Harmony in the Body) - Regulating Emotional Imbalances and Mood Disorders - Regulating Metabolism (Bodily Energy Levels) - Regulating Sleep - Hormones, Reproduction, and Fertility - Body's Ability to Cope with & Repair from Stress and/or Injury My Endocrine System Set vibrates at 528 and 440 hz, the frequencies of unconditional love, DNA repair, cognitive development, and belonging. CHAKRA SET Take a moment to envision the Milky Way Galaxy: a spinning, spiraling, milky wheel of energy. Our bodies, just like the universe, are comprised of spiraling energetic wheels. Our physicalities contains 12 energetic wheels (4 of which are outside the physical body). Each of these energetic centers is the root of a specific area of life. When our chakras are balanced\u2014 clear and free of blockages\u2014 we experience ease, flow, and expansion of consciousness in that area. When a chakra is congested or on overdrive, the symptoms appear in our physical, emotional, and mental bodies, and are projected in our lives. Properly functioning chakras translate to a properly functioning body and life! The bowls in my chakra set vibrate at 432, 440, and 528 hz. 432 is the frequency of many ancient musical instruments. It is very calming and soothing, promoting feelings of peace, grounded-ness, and wellbeing. 440 is the frequency of music today, promoting cognitive balance and development, and helping you feel immediately at home and comfortable. 528 is the vibration of unconditional love and DNA repair. There is no vibration higher than love, love entrains all. book today SOUND HEALING OFFERINGS Virtual or in-person if local to Rockaway Beach, NY. 1 hr150 US dollars Virtual or in-person if local to Rockaway Beach, NY. 1 hr 15 min220 US dollars Sound Healing Ceremony / Sound Bath for Groups SMALL GROUPS Sound Baths are a great way to create alignment and cohesiveness within family units, friend groups, offices, teams, clubs, etc. Sessions help the individuals of the group move through personal obstacles, while at the same time bringing the collective entity to the same page.
