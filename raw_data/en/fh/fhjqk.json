Yet we now know that few of the overwhelming problems we take for granted either in our life or in our world are necessary. We believe that it is the right of every individual to peace, happiness, and productivity. This is why the international NSR project offers an end to individual problems for everyone on earth, available now, researched, and proven in the experience of over 6000 NSR practitioners worldwide. Natural Stress Relief (NSR) is a simple do-it-yourself technique for experiencing a profound state of restful alertness. This inexpensive, easy-to-learn, and effortless program will allow you to sharpen your mind and wash away internal stresses, making daily activities more effective and enjoyable. On this website, you will discover how NSR allows you to \"dive within\" and effortlessly and systematically dissolve accumulated mental and physical stress, wherever you live and whatever your background. This mental technique is simple, easy, and enjoyable, and once learned can be practiced anytime and anywhere. Natural Stress Relief is [much more than just relaxation](more.php). It is a technique to [eliminate stored stresses](https://www.nsrusa.org/about-stress.php). Forget having to travel to a distant meditation center as many as six times to learn an effective and effortless system of meditation. With NSR you learn in the comfort of your own home, and at your own pace. And, as your transformation to full functioning in life evolves, we provide four methods of personal support, some free and some at very low cost, to answer any questions you might have along the way.

While we are not in any way related to the well-known Transcendental Meditation\u00ae program, NSR [compares well](compare.php) with TM\u00ae. In the American spirit of improvement through competition we are proud and happy to offer the world a more attractive alternative to TM\u00ae (on objective features) for practical stress reduction and the efficient development of self-actualization. We are proud and happy to be able to offer the public such an easy, effective, and natural program.
