Pomeranz PARANEOPLASTIC SYNDROMES AFFECTING THE PARANEOPLASTIC DISORDERS OF VOLUNTARY MUSCLE EYES DISORDER OF THE NEUROMUSCULAR JUNCTION Clinical Features A number of disorders characterized by visual dysfunc- tion, neurologic dysfunction, or both occur in the setting of known or suspected cancers but do not result from the direct effects of the tumor. These disorders are called paraneoplas- ticsyndromes and result from ''remote effects'' of the cancer (1). A paraneoplastic syndrome may develop before or aftera cancer declares itself in a primary or disseminated location.The cause and pathogenesis of most paraneoplastic disordersremain unclear, although many are now thought to involveautoimmune mechanisms. Most of these syndromes are de-fined by their clinical and pathologic features and by thelack of direct damage to the visual apparatus and centralnervous system (CNS) by tumor compression or infiltration,common infectious agents, or the toxic side effects of ther-apy. Some paraneoplastic disorders are associated with spe-cific circulating autoantibodies that serve to identify a partic-ular clinical presentation as being paraneoplastic in natureand to guide the diagnostic evaluation toward certain organsto identify the underlying cancer (2). Paraneoplastic syn-dromes are much less common than are neurologic or visualdisturbances produced by metastatic lesions, metabolic and 1715nutritional complications, or complications of therapy. Thus, in any patient with known or suspected cancer, metastasisand other potentially treatable or reversible complications must be excluded before a paraneoplastic syndrome can bediagnosed. Nevertheless, the overall incidence of remote ef-fects of cancer has been estimated to be as high as 10%(3-5). With inclusion of small-cell lung cancer and ovariancarcinoma, estimates of the incidence of paraneoplastic syn-dromes are as high as 15%. Despite the relatively infrequent occurrence of neurologic injury resulting from remote effects of cancer, recognitionof paraneoplastic syndromes is important for several reasons.When the syndrome is the initial manifestation of the cancerand is recognized as such, the underlying neoplasm may bediagnosed and treated at an early stage, potentially improv-ing the ultimate prognosis. Recognition of a specific para-neoplastic disorder allows the clinician to target the searchfor the responsible cancer to certain major organs likely tobe associated with that particular remote effect. Althougheffective treatment for most paraneoplastic disorders doesnot currently exist, palliative treatment can be offered forCLINICAL NEURO-OPHTHALMOLOGY 1716 some remote effects, such as the use of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) to treat the opsoclonus-myoclonus associ-ated with totreat the may affect the central nervous PARANEOPLASTIC SYNDROMES AFFECTING THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM PARANEOPLASTIC ENCEPHALOMYELITIS Henson et al. (7) first used the term encephalomyelitis with carcinoma to describe the development of progressive clinical manifestations that implicated injury to multiple lev- els of the nervous system in a group of patients with variousmalignancies-most often small-cell lung cancer. Paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis (PEM) is characterized clinically and pathologically by patchy, multifocal involve- ment of any or all areas of the cerebral hemispheres, limbicsystem, cerebellum, brain stem, spinal cord, Neuronal loss infiltration. In most patients with PEM,the neurologic syndrome frequently precedes the discoveryof the neoplasm by several months. The most common clini-cal manifestation of PEM is subacute sensory patchy or asymmetric numbness and paresthe-sias, often involving the face, trunk, or proximal limbs. Thesymptoms eventually spread to all limbs. Patients can havedifficulty walking because of pain and loss of proprioception(9). PEM is not as much a single disease as it is a group ofdisorders that share a common histopathologic appearancedespite differing from each other in clinical manifestationsand anatomic sites. The major disorders included under entities of subacute sensory neuronopathy and autonomic neuropathyare discussed in a separate section below under ''Para-neoplastic Peripheral Neuropathies.'' Although the individual paraneoplastic encephalomyeliti- des are presented as distinct and separate entities in thischapter, there is considerable overlap among them. For ex-ample, patients whose main clinical manifestations are thoseof cerebral encephalitis also may have symptoms and signsof damage to the brainstem (10). In addition, patients withany of these conditions may also have evidence of one ormore of the other paraneoplastic syndromes that affect thecentral and peripheral nervous system. of par-aneoplastic encephalitis, subacute cerebellar degeneration,and peripheral neuropathy may all be present in the samepatient (11-13). Finally, even when clinical symptoms andsigns indicate that the primary site of a paraneoplastic pro-cess affecting the central nervous system is limited to a spe-cific location, histopathologic abnormalities may also beidentified in other locations. Despite clear instances in whichsystem, peripheral nervous system, neuromuscular junction, or the skeletal muscles (1,3,6). In addition, there are a varietyof paraneoplastic syndromes that affect the retina and opticnerve and produce progressive visual loss. In this chapter,we discuss several of the paraneoplastic syndromes, empha-sizing aspects of neuro-ophthalmologic interest. multiple syndromes appear to overlap clinically and histo- pathologically in the same patient, the separation of certainforms of paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis has some meritin the understanding of specific clinical states. Specific Syndromes Paraneoplastic Limbic Encephalitis In the majority of patients with en- cephalitis (PLE), the neurologic symptoms are personalitychanges, irritability, depression, seizures, memory loss, andsometimes dementia (14). MRI findings in paraneoplasticlimbic encephalitis usually show increased signals on T2-weighted images in the medial temporal lobes and amygdalaand less commonly in the hypothalamus basal frontalcortex (15,16). Other common manifestations of limbic en-cephalitis include agitation, anxiety, apathy, paranoia, delu-sions, hallucinations, inappropriate behavior, and a strikingimpairment of memory (7,17-20). Patients with this syn-drome may therefore be thought to have a psychiatric disor-der (21). In these cases, damage is most severe in the hippo-campal formation, amygdaloid nucleus, cingulate gyrus,insula, and orbital cortex of This patternhas thus been termed ''limbic encephalitis'' (7,17,18). Bennett et al. (22) reported two patients with testicular cancer who exhibited supranuclear gaze disorders as a mani-festation of PEM. In the first patient, a vertical gaze palsywas accompanied by limbic encephalitis, oculogyric crises,ataxia, lid retraction, and the ocular In the sec-ond patient, a left hypertrophic skew deviation was accompa-nied by a fluctuating, mixed pendular and jerk nystagmus,dysmetria, and dysarthria. Blood from both patients con-tained the anti-Ta antibody in conjunction with testicularcancer. Brainstem (Bulbar) Encephalitis The symptoms of patients with the brainstem or bulbar form of paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis vary considerably. Patients in whom the pons and medulla are the sites of majordamage may experience vertigo, loss hearing, facialnumbness, dysphagia, these patients includevestibular nystagmus, downbeat unilateral abducens DISEASES OF NEURO-OPHTHALMOLOGIC INTEREST 1717 dysarthria, hyperactive or impaired gag reflex, hyperactive jaw jerk, and weakness and atrophy of the tongue and palatalmuscles. The symptoms and signs may be diffuse or focal(6,7,12,23-28). Abnormalities in respiration, including peri-odic hyperventilation, hypoventilation, and may also mesencephalon with paresis, diffuse ophthal-moplegia, involuntary movements (29-31). Patients with paraneoplastic brainstem encephalitis may initially be assumed to have metastatic or primary tumorinfiltration of the brainstem or carcinomatous leptomenin-geal infiltration affecting the cranial nerves. In such patients,the correct diagnosis is often made only at autopsy. Cerebellar Encephalitis The symptoms and signs of cerebellar encephalitis include gait and limb ataxia, tremor, dyssynergia, and dysarthria. and saccadic intrusions or oscillations. This syndromeis virtually impossible to distinguish clinically from para-neoplastic subacute cerebellar degeneration (see below) ex-cept that its onset tends to be more acute. In addition, otherforms of paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis may infrequentlypresent initially with evidence of dysfunction,usually gait ataxia (1,32). In affected cases, however, pancer-ebellar findings and clinical evidence of multifocal centraland peripheral neurologic involvement eventually developin the vast affected patients (32). Subacute Myelitis Nonnecrotizing paraneoplastic myelitis is an uncommon remote effect of cancer that generally does not occur as a neurologically isolated presentation (6). Affected patientstypically demonstrate other clinical manifestations of para-neoplastic encephalomyelitis and peripheral neuropathy(1,32). One clinical presentation correlated with anteriorhorn cell loss involves progressive weakness, often associ-ated with clinical findings of lower motor neuron dysfunc-tion, including wasting, fasciculations, and impaired musclestretch reflexes (6,7). The upper extremity and neck musclesare usually affected early from preferential damage to thecervical spinal cord. Respiratory compromise and bulbar pa-resis may develop if the pathologic process extends into thecaudal brainstem cranial nerve nuclei. Although progressivesensory loss rarely occurs from degeneration of the posteriorcolumns, subacute sensory neuronopathy from associateddorsal root ganglia degeneration is more commonly thecause of sensory loss in this setting (6,7). Damage to thedescending motor tracts within the spinal cord or the brain-stem causes clinical findings of upper motor neuron dysfunc-tion, including hypertonia, hyperactive muscle stretch re-flexes, and extensor plantar responses (6). Incontinence ofbowel or bladder may develop. These neurologic symptomsand physical findings are generally diffuse and not localizedto a specific clinically defined segmental level along theneuraxis. When myelopathic findings are prominent or seg-mentally localized, MR imaging or some type of myelogra-phy is necessary to determine if there is compression orinfiltration of the spinal cord by metastatic tumor, infection,or some other structural process. Another uncommon presentation of nonnecrotizing para- neoplastic myelitis is generalized or segmental rigidity andmyoclonus (33-35). Affected patients experience progres-sive aching and stiffness confined to a single extremity ormultiple limbs, followed by rigidity and frequent painfulspasms, often precipitated by tactile stimulation or attempteduse. Frequent myoclonic jerks of the affected limb occur.The affected muscles are palpably contracted, and electro-myography confirms continuous motor activity of theselimbs. Widespread damage to all extremities, the abdominal,cervical, and paraspinous muscles gives rise to progressiveimmobility and neurologic disability. These physical find-ings correlate with neuronal loss of inhibitory spinal in-terneurons within the anterior horns of the gray matter(33,34). Pathology About 75% of cases of paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis are associated with bronchial carcinomas, primarily small-cell lung cancer; however, a wide spectrum of causativetumors has been reported. These include tumors of the ovary,breast, uterus, stomach, colon, kidney, bladder, prostate, tes-ticles, thymus larynx as well Rare patients typical clinicalfeatures and characteristic neuropathologic findings of para-neoplastic encephalomyelitis have been reported in whomno neoplasm was discovered during life or following carefulpostmortem examination (36). In paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis, gross changes in the brain usually are not impressive, although in limbic encepha-litis the lesions are occasionally sufficiently extensive to bevisible on the surface of the brain and in exposed cut sec-tions. Such changes include thinning of the cortex and dis-coloration of the hippocampal formation. The characteristichistopathologic changes are inflammatory and consist ofprominent perivascular cuffing by lymphocytes and occa-sionally by plasma cells in the brain and spinal cord paren-chyma and to a lesser extent in the overlying meninges.In addition, damage and loss of neurons, neuronophagia,microglial infiltration, and microglial nodule formation inthe parenchyma are prominent findings. The process affectsgray matter more extensively than white matter. Walleriandegeneration of tracts extending from the regions of neuronalloss also occurs in this setting. The extent of damage varies from case to case (6,37). Some patients show widespread changes (11), whereas inothers the pathologic abnormalities are restricted to a singleregion (7). In limbic encephalitis, as noted above, the histo-logic abnormalities are located primarily in mesial temporallobe structures, including the amygdala, hippocampus, anduncus, as the insula and gyrus. In brain-stem encephalitis, the nuclei cranial nerves, the infe-rior olivary nuclei, the vestibular nuclei, the basis pontis,and are most commonly affected. WhenCLINICAL NEURO-OPHTHALMOLOGY 1718 the cerebellum is the site of the paraneoplastic process, the dentate nuclei are usually most severely affected, resultingin atrophy of the superior cerebellar peduncles. The extent ofdamage in the cerebellar cortex is variable, but inflammatorychanges and loss of neurons usually are not marked. Nonnec-rotizing subacute myelitis affects primarily the gray matterand may damage only a portion of the spinal cord (usuallythe cervical or lumbar segments) or the entire spinal cord.This process damages both the anterior and posterior horns,causing variable degrees of inflammation and neuronal loss.White matter tracts may show Wallerian degeneration fromdistant lesions in ascending or descending fiber pathways.Loss of neurons in the anterior horns is associated with atro-phy of the anterior spinal roots. If the process is severe, thereis also neurogenic atrophy in the skeletal muscles suppliedby these roots (3). Degeneration of the posterior columnsusually occurs secondary to inflammation and neuronal lossaffecting the dorsal root ganglia (6). Diagnostic Evaluations The protein in the CSF is increased in most cases of para- neoplastic encephalomyelitis, typically in the usually be-tween frequently exists. Oligoclonal bands and elevated immunoglobulin indices and synthesis rates aresometimes detected. The electroencephalogram (EEG) maybe abnormal in cases of limbic encephalitis, showing non-specific slowing or background irregularities, or there maybe focal epileptiform discharges that are either unassociatedwith any behavioral abnormality (21) or that correlate with aclinically evident seizure disorder (38). Cranial CT scanningusually shows no specific abnormality, but it may revealchanges consistent with brain atrophy. In cases of limbicencephalitis, brain MR imaging may show an abnormallyhigh signal intensity in the medial temporal lobes (15,16,39,40) (Fig. 36.1). Many patients with paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis have an autoantibody present in high titers in their serumand CSF that reacts with neurons of the central and periph-eral nervous system (41). This antibody\u2014often called anti- Huto recognize the first two letters of the last name of the original patient studied by Dr. Jerome Posner and associatesat Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (42), and alsoreferred to as antineuronal nuclear antibody type 1 by other investigators to acknowledge its immunohistochemicalpattern of reactivity (2,43)\u2014is most commonly identifiedin patients with paraneoplastic lung cancer (Tables 36.1 and 36.2). However,anti-Hu seropositivity in the setting of paraneoplastic en-cephalomyelitis also occurs in patients with a variety of othercancers, including neuroblastoma, and occasionally occursin patients with no identifiable neoplasm (41). The anti-Huantibody is generally not found in neurologically normalpersons or in patients with cancer who have a remote effectother than encephalomyelitis or subacute sensory neurono-pathy (4,33). False positive results of anti-Hu testing thusare infrequent (2). Patients with typical encephalomyelitisbut without tumor identified either during life or at autopsyhave been reported (41).

Abnormalhigh signal intensity is seen in the medial aspect of the left temporal lobe(double arrows), and to a less dramatic degree, in the right temporal lobe(single arrow). (From Kalkman PH, Allan S, and normal patients with small-cell lung cancer have the anti-Hu antibody, but their titers are generally far lower thanthose titers found in patients paraneoplastic encephalo-myelitis (44,45). complications ofprimary seropositivehave been reported (46). Anti-Hu seropositivity is alwayspresent at the time a patient presents with symptoms of para-neoplastic encephalomyelitis, which, as noted above, com-monly precedes the identification of the underlying malig-nancy. Therefore, identification of the anti-Hu antibody ina patient whose clinical presentation is consistent with para-neoplastic encephalomyelitis or who has an unexplained sen-sory neuronopathy should prompt a careful search for lungcancer or some other malignancy if the initial evaluation isunrevealing. A malignancy is still likely to appear at somelater date in those patients with a suspicious neurologic pre-sentation and who have an anti-Hu antibody at high titer butno clinically identified neoplasm. In a study of survival and outcome in 73 patients with anti-Hu positive paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis, Smitt etal. (47) found that the most frequent signs and symptomsPARANEOPLASTIC DISEASES OF NEURO-OPHTHALMOLOGIC INTEREST 1719 Table 36.1 Antibodies in Neurologic and Ocular Paraneoplastic Syndromes Antibody Size (kd) Function Associated Syndrome Antibodies Associated with Paraneoplastic Neurologic or Ocular Syndromes Antibodies Associated with Neurologic Syndromes that Can Occur With or Without Cancer ANNA, nuclear antibody; binding RNA binding DNA binding DNA bindingUnknownNeuronal development UnknownSynaptic vessel was detected, which was a lungtumor in 77%. The median delay between onset of symptomsand Hu antibody diagnosis was four months. Differential Diagnosis When a patient with neurologic or visual dysfunction has a known primary tumor, intraparenchymal and leptomenin-geal metastasis must first be excluded. Opportunistic infec-tions associated with depressed immunity from either theunderlying malignancy or from chemotherapy must also beconsidered when evaluating a patient with cancer who hasneuropsychiatric, cranial nerve, or multifocal neurologic def-icits. The most common infectious diseases affecting thecentral nervous system that occur in this setting orMucorales (48). Neurologic complications of cancer treatment, including the side effects of chemotherapy and radiation therapy,should also be considered in the differential diagnosis ofvisual or neurological presentations consistent with thesymptoms of paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis already dis-cussed. This topic is discussed in greater detail in Chapter 37, but in this section it is worth emphasizing some of thecommon offending agents that can injure the eye and nervoussystem, causing manifestations that mimic those of the re-mote effects of cancer. These disorders, and the drugs thatcause them, include retinopathy (49,50). In addition to the direct effects of metastatic disease and the indirect effects related to infectious diseases and side effects of chemotherapy, the differential diagnosis of para-neoplastic disease includes vascular complications of cancer(51). Tumor emboli may produce focal brain infarctions aswell as generalized neurologic dysfunction from diffuse ormultifocal cerebral ischemia. The alteration in level of con-sciousness, cranial nerve deficits, cerebellar dysfunction,and weakness that frequently accompanies vertebrobasilarartery thrombosis can mimic presentation of para-neoplastic and duralsinus thrombosis and disseminated signs of generalized encephalopathy as well asfocal neurologic deficits that might be confused with para-neoplastic encephalomyelitis. The differential diagnosis of paraneoplastic encephalomy-CLINICAL NEURO-OPHTHALMOLOGY 1720 also encompasses a lengthy group of secondary meta- bolic and nutritional disorders that can cause acute or chronicprogressive encephalopathy. These conditions include hy-percalcemia, hyponatremia secondary to hypoglycemia, hepatic encephalopathy, uremia,pellagra, and deficiencies of folic acid and of vitamins B 1 and B 12. Patients in whom neuropsychiatric symptoms and signs of paraneoplastic encephalitis develop before the discoveryof an underlying malignancy initially may be thought to haveone of the subacute or chronic dementias, such as Creutz-feldt-Jakob Alzheimer's disease, Patients with paraneoplastic cerebellar encephali-tis may initially be thought to have a variety of conditions,including primary or metastatic tumor in the cerebellum,paraneoplastic subacute cerebellar degeneration, hypothy-roidism, drug intoxication, multiple sclerosis, cerebrovascu-lar disease, or late onset hereditary ataxia. Similarly, theclinical features of paraneoplastic brainstem encephalitismay be mimicked by many nonneoplastic disorders, sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, cerebral Whipple's disease. can cause neurologic deficits that could be confusedwith the presentations of nonneoplastic inflammatory my-elopathy associated with a systemic vasculitis or connectivetissue disease or multiple sclerosis, motor neuron disease,subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord associ-ated with vitamin B 12deficiency, or nonneoplastic compres- sion of the spinal cord by, for example, cervical spondylosis.PARANEOPLASTIC DISEASES OF NEURO-OPHTHALMOLOGIC INTEREST 1721 Pathogenesis: The Anti-Hu Syndrome Earlier theories of the pathogenesis of paraneoplastic en- cephalomyelitis speculated that the inflammatory changes were secondary to a primary degenerative process or an oc-cult opportunistic viral infection. Apart from the histopatho-logic findings in this disorder, the evidence supporting suchmechanisms remains sparse. The inflammatory reactioncould occur in response to neuronal death that results froma neurotoxin or hormone elaborated by the underlying neo-plasm (1,6). More recent investigations have focused on im-mune mechanisms as the most attractive hypothesis for thecause of paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis (2,433). In gen-eral, the immune theory proposes that certain antigens, aber-rantly expressed somehow by the cancer, are shared betweenthat tumor and specific neural components of the centraland peripheral nervous system or retina. When the immunesystem somehow recognizes the tumor antigen as foreign,an immune response is directed not only against the tumor,but also against the shared antigen in the nervous system.Both cellular and humoral immune systems are involved inuncertain ways to cause immune-mediated neuronal loss andinflammatory damage (52). A paradoxic benefit of the auto-immune response is that it may limit the rate of growth anddissemination of the tumor against which the response isdirected. The recognition and characterization of the anti-Hu, or antineuronal nuclear type 1, antibody has allowed investiga-tors to explore the neuronal and cancer protein targets ofthe autoimmune attack. However, the precise role that theautoantibodies assume in neuronal damage and clinical dis-ease development remains undefined. In Western blot analy-sis, the anti-Hu antibody reacts against protein extracts of neural tissue whose molecular weights range between 35-40kd (42) (Fig. 36.2). The immunohistochemical reactions ofthis antibody include staining of the nuclei and, to a lesserdegree, the cytoplasm of all neurons of the central nervoussystem, the dorsal root ganglia, and the autonomic have identi-fied three autoantigens, designated HuD, HuC, and Hel-N1,that belong to a larger family of neuronal RNA binding pro-teins that anti-Hu antibodies react against (53). The Hu anti-gen (HuD) is expressed in small-cell lung cancers (54) and,less frequently, in other cancers, including neuroblastomas(41). Serum from anti-Hu patients with paraneoplas-tic encephalomyelitis small-cell lung cancerin a pattern resembling that reactivity against neurons, sup-porting the theory that shared antigens are important in thepathogenesis of these paraneoplastic disorders (55). TheCSF/H11018serum ratio of anti-Hu antibody activity in patientswith paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis is generally greaterthan 1, suggesting that these autoantibodies are synthesizedintrathecally (56). Issues that remain unresolved includeidentification of those factors that result in the expressionof cancer antigens, mechanisms of the aberrant immune re-sponse, and determinants of immune-mediated neuronaldamage and cell death. Treatment There is no specific therapy for any of the paraneoplastic encephalomyelitides. Partial spontaneous improvement of Figure 36.2.

Neurology 1994;44 /H110182241-2246.) neurologic deficits has been rarely described (57-59). Also, patients have only rarely experienced substantial recoverydespite successful treatment of their underlying malignancy(19,26,34,39,60-64). Finally, isolated examples have beenreported of patients improving in response to treatment withcorticosteroids (65-67) or plasmapheresis (68). There is no evidence that immunosuppressive treatment in patients with paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis and anti-Hu antibodies is associated with worse tumor outcome (69).Patients with paraneoplastic syndromes associated with anti-bodies to Ma2 protein, particularly the younger patients withlimbic-hypothalamic encephalitis, may have significant neu-rologic responses to prompt treatment of the tumor and im-munomodulation (70). Prognosis In most patients who develop paraneoplastic encephalo- myelitis, there is a relentless, usually fairly rapid progressiveneurologic deterioration over weeks to months, ending indeath or prolonged severe disability.

Dalmau, M.D, Ph.D.) cess itself and not by any direct effects of the underlying primary malignancy, which most often is restricted to a sin-gle primary location, perhaps with spread to a few regionallymph nodes (41). In fact, some investigators have foundthat patients with a paraneoplastic syndrome or the anti-Huantibody have improved cancer survival and less extensivecancer dissemination compared with those patients withoutremote effects or antibody (4,44,45,71). SUBACUTE CEREBELLAR DEGENERATION This is a paraneoplastic syndrome in which the neurologic manifestations are strongly dominated by clinical abnormali-ties referable to pancerebellar dysfunction, including truncaland limb ataxia. The syndrome is rare compared with para-neoplastic encephalomyelitis. Nevertheless, if one considersall cases of adult, nonfamilial cerebellar degeneration, about50% will eventually be found to be associated with an under-lying malignancy (6). Clinical Features Paraneoplastic subacute cerebellar degeneration occurs al- most exclusively in adults. The relative proportion of af-fected women and men is somewhat related to the organaffected by the underlying neoplasm, although women areexclusively affected in that disorder associated with a spe-cific anti-Purkinje cell antibody sometimes referred to asanti-Yo (72,73) (Tables 36.1 and 36.2). Frequently, the con-dition presents months to a few years before the associated malignancy declares itself (74-76). The earliest manifesta-tion is usually mild gait incoordination, and the typicalcourse is characterized by rapid deterioration over the fol-lowing few weeks to months involving progressive gaitataxia, truncal instability, symmetric ataxia and dysmetriaof all four extremities, dysarthria, and dysphagia. After afew months, the condition stabilizes, leaving the patient withsevere and disabling neurologic deficits. Infrequently, the onset may be acute, with rapid deterioration occurring duringthe following few days to weeks. Conversely, it may be moreinsidious in onset and may progress more slowly than thetypical course. Oscillopsia, diplopia, vertigo, and nausea are commonly associated manifestations of paraneoplastic subacute cere-bellar degeneration. Careful testing of other neurologic func-tions will occasionally reveal evidence of mild cognitiveimpairment, hearing loss, upper motor neuron dysfunction,extrapyramidal signs, and peripheral neuropathy (72). Thus,the syndrome may have elements not only of cerebellar de-generation but also cerebral and brainstem encephalomyeli-tis or peripheral nerve involvement (11,12). In particular, anassociation between cerebellar degeneration and the Eaton-Lambert syndrome has been noted, most often but not exclu-sively in patients with small-cell lung cancer (77). Subacute cerebellar degeneration has most commonly been described in association with carcinomas of the lungand ovary (78), but it may also occur in patients with carcino-PARANEOPLASTIC DISEASES OF NEURO-OPHTHALMOLOGIC INTEREST 1723 mas of the breast, uterus, fallopian tubes, stomach, colon, prostate, thyroid gland, kidney, and larynx as well as in pa-tients with Hodgkin's disease and lymphoma(1,6,72,73,75,79). The neuro-ophthalmologic manifestations paraneoplas- tic subacute cerebellar degeneration primarily affect the ocu-lar motor system, causing disturbances of fixation, motility,and alignment. Various forms of nystagmus, ocular dysmet-ria, saccadic pursuit, saccadic intrusions and oscillations, andskew deviation thus occur in a substantial percentage of pa-tients. For example, nearly 50% of the patients with para-neoplastic cerebellar degeneration associated with Hodg-kin's disease cases reported by Hammack et al. (79) haddownbeat nystagmus, and nearly two thirds had ocular dys-metria. The syndrome of paraneoplastic subacute cerebellar de- generation can be grouped into certain categories based uponthe associated tumor type and cancer-related autoantibodystatus. Some differences in the general clinical features,course, and prognosis are associated with some of these cate-gories. For example, some patients have a specific type ofcirculating autoantibody, called anti-Yo (after the first two letters of the index patient studied by the investigators atMemorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York) oranti-Purkinje cell cytoplasmic type 1 antibody (72,73) (Tables 36.1 and 36.2). Seropositive patients are almost al-ways women with ovarian cancer, breast cancer, or someother gynecologic malignancy, whose tumor has generallynot spread beyond the affected organ and local lymph nodes.The paraneoplastic presentation usually precedes the recog-nition of the cancer in these patients. In fact, surgical explo-ration of the pelvis is strongly recommended by some inves-tigators for seropositive women with an unexplainedpresentation of cerebellar dysfunction without recognizedbreast or gynecologic cancer identified by clinical, radio-logic, and tumor marker approaches (72,73). The course ofneurologic impairment is progressive and debilitating, andit does not respond to treatment of the malignancy. Another type of paraneoplastic subacute cerebellar degen- eration occurs in patients with Hodgkin's disease (79). Thesepatients tend to be younger than non-Hodgkin's disease pa-tients with cerebellar degeneration, and they are most oftenmen. The disorder usually develops after the neoplasm hasbeen established and often when the patient is in remission.Anti-Purkinje cell antibodies are occasionally found, butthey demonstrate reactivity characteristics that differ fromthe anti-Yo antibody. Anti-Tr and anti-metabo-tropic glutamate receptor type I (mGluR1) antibodies to reduce basal activity of Purkinje cells, disturbcompensatory eye movements, and cause chronic degenera-tion of Purkinje cells (80). In a study of 28 patients withanti-Tr antibodies (81), a cerebellar syndrome was identifiedin 27 patients and Hodgkin's lymphoma was diagnosed in25 patients. Anti-Tr antibodies spontaneously disappeared in10/10 patients after successful Hodgkin's disease treatment.The clinical features of the neurologic presentation andcourse do not differ significantly from those of other patientswith paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration except that someof these patients experience spontaneous improvement,either transiently or, in rare cases, permanently. Pathology The primary pathologic lesion in the syndrome of a cells in the cerebellar cortex (11,12,74,75,82) (Fig. 36.4). The loss of cells is usu-ally diffuse and severe, but it may occasionally be patchy.Not surprisingly, the loss of this prominent population ofneurons is accompanied by gliosis and the formation of mi-croglial shrubbery in the molecular layer, where the den-drites of Purkinje cells normally are located. Loss of Purkinjecell axon projections also produces demyelination and glio-sis in the white matter, especially around the dentate nucleus.There may also be some neuronal loss in the granular celllayer. The deep cerebellar nuclei, the peduncles, and theextracerebellar nuclei that have connections to the cerebel-lum usually remain normal. Occasional cases, particularlythose in which there are symptoms of brainstem or spinalcord dysfunction, also have degeneration outside the cerebel-lum (6,12,32). Diagnostic Evaluations In patients with paraneoplastic subacute cerebellar degen- eration, the CSF may be normal or may show a mild lympho-cytic pleocytosis, increased protein concentration, elevatedimmunoglobulin indices and synthesis rates, and oligoclonalbands. In advanced cases, cranial CT scanning or brain MRimaging may show enlargement ventricle,prominent cerebellar sulci, and enlarged pericerebellar (Fig. 36.5), but in the early stages, neuroimaging oftengives normal results (76). A paraneoplastic antibody work-up should be initiated to determine whether anti-Yo or anti-Ri antibodies are present. Differential Diagnosis When a person with known or suspected cancer develops cerebellar symptoms and signs, neuroimaging is required todetermine if metastases are present within the cerebellum.When such lesions are not identified, one must consider 5-fluoro-uracil or cytarabine. When a subacute cerebellar syndrome evolves in an adult in the absence of a known neoplasm, the possibility of anunderlying malignancy must nevertheless be considered, anda careful physical examination, as well as CT scanning ofthe chest, abdomen, and pelvis in women, should be per-formed. In this setting, the physician must also consider al-ternative diagnoses, including alcoholic cerebellar degenera-tion, with a T-cell lymphoma. A,Whole mount of one cerebellar hemisphere shows severe cerebellar cortical atrophy, particularly pronounced in superior region. Dorsal and ventral paraflocculus (arrowheads) are relatively preserved, as are patchy areas throughout other regions of the hemisphere ( arrows).

An acute or subacute pancerebellar syndrome can also occuras a postviral or idiopathic nonparaneoplastic disorder (83). Pathogenesis hypotheses the pathogenesis of paraneoplastic subacute cerebellar degeneration are specula-tive, it is most likely an autoimmune disorder. As alreadymentioned, antibodies to Purkinje cells may be present inthe serum and CSF of patients with subacute cerebellar de-generation associated with a variety of malignancies, of the ovary and breast, small-cell lung and Hodgkin's disease (84-88) (Fig. 36.6). In addition,the CSF/H11018serum ratio of antibody concentration in seroposi-tive patients is often greater than 1, indicating that theseantibodies are produced, or at least concentrated, within thecentral nervous system (89). In human tissue, the anti-Yoantibody stains the cytoplasm and proximal dendrites of Pur-kinje cells in a granular pattern (87,90). immunoblotPARANEOPLASTIC DISEASES OF NEURO-OPHTHALMOLOGIC INTEREST 1725 Figure 36.5.

Ann Neurol 1983;14/H11018609-613.)as well as the Golgi apparatus. The function of these proteins is unknown, but it is thought that they may regulate genetranscription by binding to DNA. Tumors from patients with anti-Yo seropositive cerebellar degeneration express 1726 from an aberrant autoimmune response associated with shared tumor and central nervous system antigens (92).About 20% of ovarian tumors from patients without para-neoplastic cerebellar degeneration also express Yo antigens(93). Several other anti-Purkinje cell antibodies whose reac-tion characteristics differ from those of the anti-Yo antibodyhave been identified (79,94,95). Finally, non-Purkinje cell antibodies are found in patients with paraneoplastic subacute cerebellar degeneration andanti-Purkinje cell antibodies. For example, glutamate receptors are with paraneoplastic cerebellar degenerationand anti-Yo antibodies, suggesting that the remote effect inthese patients may occur by excitotoxic mechanisms involv-ing glutamate receptors (96,97). These studies, combinedwith the lack of evidence supporting any viral or toxic cause,strongly suggest that this paraneoplastic syndrome is autoim-mune. Treatment The treatment of paraneoplastic subacute cerebellar de- generation is directed at identifying and treating the underly-ing neoplasm. Unfortunately, most patients do not improveeven when the neoplasm is treatable. Nevertheless, in a smallnumber of cases, the neurologic defects stabilize after suc-cessful treatment of the cancer (72,76,79,98). Paone and Jey-asingham (99) and Kearsley et al. (100) reported rapid andmarked neurologic improvement in their patients after surgi-cal removal of their primary malignancies. Corticosteroidsare generally ineffective, but other forms of immunosuppres-sive treatment have occasionally been shown to be benefi-cial. For example, intravenous immunoglobulin (101,102)and plasmapheresis (73,103) have produced transient andeven sustained improvement in some patients. Widdess-Walsh et al. (104) noted a marked beneficial response tointravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and methylpredniso-lone in a patient with ovarian carcinoma and paraneoplasticsubacute cerebellar degeneration. They reviewed the litera-ture and found that good responses were associated withinstitution of treatment with 2 g/kg IVIG within 1 month ofdevelopment of symptoms. Finally, isolated patients haveexperienced improvement after being treated with thiamine(105) or clonazepam (79). Prognosis Most patients with paraneoplastic subacute cerebellar de- develop oscillopsia, dysarthria, limb ataxia,and gait unsteadiness, thus limiting their ability to ambulateand perform many other activities of daily living indepen-dently. Rarely, the disorder may arrest at an earlier stage sothat an affected patient may still be able to ambulate unas-sisted, although with some ataxia. Eekhof (106) reportedspontaneous remission of disease before treatment of adeno-carcinoma of the lung in an 83-year-old man. In most pa-tients, however, the syndrome progresses until death resultsfrom complications of either the underlying malignancy orthe neurologic deficits (e.g., aspiration pneumonia).Most seropositive patients with known cancer at the time they present with symptoms of cerebellar degeneration havedisease limited to the primary organ or regional lymphnodes, or they have metastatic disease of limited volumecompared with those patients with cancer unassociated witha paraneoplastic syndrome (73,107). In some patients, theneurologic presentation heralds recurrence or progression ofneoplastic disease that was previously treated and controlled(73,100,103,107). PARANEOPLASTIC SYNDROME OF OPSOCLONUS, MYOCLONUS, AND ATAXIA Although opsoclonus is discussed in general in Chapter 23, the syndrome of opsoclonus (and ocular flutter), myoclo-nus, and ataxia is also emphasized here because it can bea remote effect of cancer in patients with neuroblastoma(108-112) or other malignant tumors (113-119). Clinical Features Patients with this paraneoplastic disorder typically experi- ence abrupt onset of the cardinal features, often accompaniedby vertigo, nausea, vomiting, and, commonly in children,other symptoms that might otherwise suggest the presenceof a viral syndrome. Along with the disorder of eye move-ment, there is almost always truncal and limb ataxia. In addi-tion, most patients show random coarse or fine myoclonicmovements of the head, trunk, or limbs. These myoclonicjerks are not generally accompanied by any epileptiform dis-charges on the EEG, and they are not synchronous with theabnormal eye movements. Even in patients with advancedcancer, the ataxia and myoclonus may be the major causeof disability. Altered mental status, consisting of apathy,lethargy, and confusion in adults, and irritability and confu-sion in children, frequently occurs along with the other neu-rologic manifestations (119). This syndrome is most common in children between the ages of 8 months and 5 years, with a peak incidence at about18 months of age (120), although it can occur in adults aswell. When it occurs in childhood, girls are affected slightlymore frequently than boys. In adults, there is no sex predilec-tion. In children, by far the most common malignancy re-sponsible is an occult neuroblastoma. About 2% occult neuroblastomas(120). In adults, carcinomas of the lung, breast, uterus, ovary,fallopian tube, thyroid, thymus, and bladder, as well as lym-phomas, sarcomas, and even neuroblastoma may be present(105,111,113,114,117-119,121-129). Exceptional exam-ples of this syndrome occurring with intracranial neoplasmswere reported by Keane and Devereaux (116) in a patientwith a hemispheric glioblastoma multiforme and by Boghenet al. (130) in a patient with a craniopharyngioma. In adults,about 20% of patients presenting with opsoclonus have oc-cult malignancies (123). Pathology The pathologic abnormalities in patients with the para- neoplastic opsoclonus-myoclonus-ataxia syndrome vary.PARANEOPLASTIC DISEASES OF NEURO-OPHTHALMOLOGIC INTEREST 1727 36.7. Histopathologic appearance of the cerebellum in a 58-year-old woman with opsoclonus and signs of cerebellar disease in association with carcinoma of the breast. A,Cerebellar folia show severe loss of Purkinje cells. B,High-power view shows a focus of gliosis in the molecular layer (arrows) and infiltration of the meninges by nonneoplastic mononuclear cells. (From Ellenberger C Jr, Netsky MG. Anatomic and diagnostic value of opsoclonus. Arch Ophthalmol 1970;83 /H11018307-310.) Some cases have shown a patchy decrease in the number of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum with demyelination andgliosis or in the dentate (Fig.36.7). Other neuropathologic changes in the cerebellum in the central nervous system include perivascularlymphocytic cuffing, microglial infiltration, and astrocyticgliosis (129,132). One of the patients reported by Ridley etal. (133) had, in addition to loss of Purkinje cells, completeloss of neurons of the inferior parenchymal lymphocytic cerebellum and brainstem are bothgrossly and microscopically normal (116,130,133). Diagnostic Evaluations Except for those exceptionally rare patients with an intra- cranial neoplasm, most patients with the paraneoplastic op-soclonus-myoclonus-ataxia syndrome have normal neuroim-aging studies of the CNS. Nevertheless, the patient reportedin the Case Records of the Massachusetts General Hospital(134) showed an abnormal T2-weighted signal in the mid-brain tectum on MR imaging, and another adult patient re-ported by Hersh et al. (132) had abnormal hypersignal inten-sity in the brainstem. The CSF is usually normal in thissyndrome but may show a mildly increased concentrationof protein and lymphocytic pleocytosis in both children andadults (112,120,123,129,133,135). found in some pa-tients with paraneoplastic opsoclonus and may help to direct the search for an occult malignancy. The anti-Hu antibodyhas occasionally been identified in adults and children withneuroblastomas and other neoplasms (71,132,136) (Tables36.1 and 36.2). Anti-Yo and other anti-Purkinje cell may be found in women with paraneoplastic opsoclonusand cerebellar degeneration associated with cancer of thebreast or gynecologic organs (73,123,134,137) and, rarely,in some patients with other neoplasms (138). In addition, athird antineuronal antibody, called anti-Ri by the investiga-tors at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center to acknowl-edge the first two letters of the last name of their index case,which is called ''antineuronal nuclear antibody type 2'' byother investigators (2,43) (Tables 36.1 and 36.2), is some-times found in the serum and CSF of adult patients withparaneoplastic opsoclonus and ataxia. Like the anti-Hu anti-body, the reacts with the nuclei of all neu- rons of the central nervous system, including Purkinje cells(Fig. 36.8). Unlike the anti-Hu antibody, however, the anti-Ri antibody does not react against neurons of the peripheralnervous system, such as the dorsal root and sympatheticganglia (139). The anti-Ri antibody is further distinguishedby its unique reactions with antigens whose molecularweights are about 55 and 80 kd in Western blot analysisusing neuronal extracts (42,135) (Fig. closelyrelated ''Nova'' reacting with anti-Ri anti-bodies have been cloned (140-141).

Dalmau, M.D., Ph.D.) binding proteins believed to be involved in the regulation of mRNA splicing. Most anti-Ri seropositive patients,whether or not they have the opsoclonus-myoclonus-ataxiasyndrome, have breast cancer (135); but rare examples ofanti-Ri seropositive patients with other malignancies havebeen reported (135,142), as have examples of patients withthe opsoclonus-myoclonus-ataxia syndrome but withoutcancer, patients with neither cancer nor neurologic dysfunc-tion (143-145), and patients with neurologic remote effectsof cancer but without opsoclonus (31). Despite these rareexceptions, anti-Ri antibodies are generally not found in nor-mal persons, patients with breast cancer who do not haveparaneoplastic syndromes, or patients with nonparaneoplas-tic opsoclonus (142). Because of the well-established association between oc- cult cancer and the opsoclonus-myoclonus-ataxia syndrome,any child or adult with this presentation must undergo carefuland complete clinical and radiologic evaluations to identifyan underlying neoplasm. As already mentioned, this associa- tion is particularly strong in children harboring occult neuro-blastomas. Children with neuroblastomas that present withopsoclonus commonly do not have a palpable tumor, ele-vated concentrations of urinary catecholamines, or massesdetected with plain radiographs of the chest or abdomen(112,120,146,147). Therefore, children with opsoclonusshould undergo CT scanning or MR imaging of the neck,chest, and abdomen unless the results of clinical examinationand plain radiographs suggest a more specific region. Radio- active metaiodobenzylguanidine scanning may be a moresensitive test than CT scanning for the early detection andlocalization of an occult neuroblastoma in children present-ing with opsoclonus (148). Normal results of screening tests(e.g., urine catecholamines) or plain radiographs do not ex-clude the presence of a neuroblastoma. Differential Diagnosis The qualities of abnormal eye movement that clinically define opsoclonus are so characteristic that they should notusually cause the examining clinician to generate an ex-panded differential diagnosis, although opsoclonus may attimes be confused with other forms of saccadic oscillations,such as square-wave jerks and macrosaccadic oscillations,nystagmus, or the corrective saccades associated with sac-cadic dysmetria. In addition, rare persons who are otherwisenormal and who have no evidence of underlying neurologicdisease can voluntarily generate abnormal eye movementswith characteristics similar to, but not identical with, thoseof opsoclonus and ocular flutter (149). The syndrome of opsoclonus-myoclonus-ataxia can occur in the setting of other paraneoplastic CNSdisorders, includ-ing encephalomyelitis and subacute cerebellar degeneration.In the setting malignancy, this syndrome can becaused by posterior fossa metastases that directly injure thebrainstem or cerebellum or indirectly produce obstruc-PARANEOPLASTIC DISEASES OF NEURO-OPHTHALMOLOGIC INTEREST 1729 tive hydrocephalus, by a coagulopathy or a bleeding dia- thesis that cause an ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke affectingthe brainstem or cerebellum, by radiation to the neuralor vascular structures in the posterior fossa, or by the toxiceffects of certain chemotherapeutic agents, such as 5-fluoro-uracil or cytarabine. In children, additional nonparaneoplas-tic causes of opsoclonus include viral encephalitis and a tran-sient benign disorder observed in otherwise healthy neonates(119,123,150), whereas nonparaneoplastic causes of op-soclonus in adults opsoclonus- myoclonus-ataxia syndrome is unclear, but most investiga-tors believe that it is an autoimmune disorder. Supportingthis hypothesis are investigations demonstrating antineu-ronal antibodies in the serum and CSF of patients with thecondition. The higher concentrations of antibody in the CSFcompared with the serum in many affected patients suggestthat local intrathecal production of these antibodies is impor-tant in the development of this remote effect (135). Antineu-ronal immunoglobulins from seropositive patients para-neoplastic opsoclonus react against the underlying tumor tis-sue obtained from surgical pathology specimens (135).These studies suggest that autoantibodies produced in re-sponse to the expression of certain specific tumor antigensmay cross-react against various central nervous system anti-gens, such as a biochemically characterized Ri-associatedantigen, called Nova, that is a protein detected in the humanbrain and expressed in the developing ventral brainstem ofmice (151-152). How the interaction between autoanti-bodies and CNSneuronal antigens leads to the syndrome ofopsoclonus-myoclonus-ataxia remains undefined. The bene-ficial response of some patients when treated with immuno-suppressant medication (e.g., corticosteroids) or immuno-modulating agents (e.g., intravenous immunoglobulin) alsoindirectly supports an autoimmune mechanism of diseasedevelopment. Additional evidence in favor of an autoimmune pathogen- esis of the paraneoplastic opsoclonus-myoclonus-ataxia syn-drome is the finding of alterations of cell-mediated immunityin patients with this condition. Herishanu et al. (122) per-formed immunologic studies in a patient with adenocarci-noma of the breast who developed the opsoclonus-myoclo-nus-ataxia syndrome and demonstrated decreased functionof suppressor T-cells and hyperactivity of helper T-cells de-spite a normal suppressor/H11018helper ratio. The immunologicabnormalities (as well as the clinical syndrome) improvedwhen the patient was treated with systemic corticosteroids.Helper/inducer T-cells were predominantly found in theperivascular inflammatory infiltrate of the region of the par-amedian pontine reticular formation, whereas suppressor/cy-totoxic T-cells were mainly interstitium of apatient who had anti-Ri-associated opsoclonus (145). Natu-ral killer cells and compliment reactivity were also presentin this patient (145). Causes other than an autoimmune response may be re- sponsible for at least some cases of the paraneoplastic op-soclonus-myoclonus-ataxia syndrome. The improvementthat followed administration of thiamine in a patient reportedby Nausieda et al. (105) suggests that, at least in that patient,nutritional deficiencies that may be attributable to metabolicactivity of the tumor may have been responsible for the syn-drome. Pranzatelli et al. (434) found significantly lower CSFlevels of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, the major oxidativemetabolite of serotonin, in some, but not all, children withopsoclonus-myoclonus compared with controls, suggestingthat biochemical alterations may be important in the patho-genesis of opsoclonus in some affected patients. Because ofthe confounding interaction of age, these investigators werenot able to determine whether differences existed betweenthose children with neuroblastomas and those without malig-nancies. Treatment Opsoclonus, myoclonus, and ataxia frequently persist after resection of the underlying neoplasm. Nevertheless,Caviness et al. (127) reported a 53-year-old woman whodeveloped opsoclonus and myoclonus around the time shewas discovered to have adenocarcinoma of the breast. Afterbilateral radical mastectomies, the opsoclonus and myoclo-nus resolved and did not return during the next 7 years offollow-up. Other investigators have also reported resolutionof the paraneoplastic opsoclonus-myoclonus-ataxia syn-drome after resection of the underlying neoplasm (seebelow). In circumstances when a tumor thought responsible through distant effects for the opsoclonus-myoclonus-ataxiasyndrome is not amenable to cure or radical resection, ACTH may transient improvement in the symptoms and signs ofthe paraneoplastic process. As noted above, Nausieda et al.(105) reported that the administration of thiamine reversedthe opsoclonus in a 52-year-old man with anaplastic bron-chogenic carcinoma. Although plasmapheresis has not beenproven beneficial in patients with the paraneoplastic op-soclonus-myoclonus-ataxia syndrome, other forms of immu-nomodulating treatments, including intravenous immuno-globulin (136) and immunoadsorption (138) may inducepartial remission. Rarely, treatment of the underlying malig-nancy in adults who have tumors other than neuroblastomasmay provide partial improvement (125,129). Prognosis The ultimate prognosis in patients with the opsoclonus- myoclonus-ataxia syndrome is related to eradication of theunderlying tumor. When the tumor can be treated success-fully, the paraneoplastic syndrome may resolve, and evenradical excision of an incurable malignancy may be associ-CLINICAL NEURO-OPHTHALMOLOGY 1730 ated with transient improvement or at least stabilization of the neurologic dysfunction (100,120). The best prognosis isin children with neuroblastoma, in whom the opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome seems to indicate a localized, curabletumor (110,120,147,152,153). Nevertheless, many patients,particularly children with neuroblastoma, have residual neu-rologic deficits, especially intellectual impairment, be-havioral disorders, and motor dysfunction (120,147,153).In addition, many investigators emphasize that theneuroblastoma-associated neurologic disorder in childrentends to be chronic and characterized by remissions inducedby corticosteroids or ACTH and by relapses withdrawal of medication, febrile illnesses, andimmunizations (112,147,153). The prognosis is far less favorable in adults with the para- neoplastic opsoclonus-myoclonus-ataxia syndrome. Adultswhose tumors cannot be cured tend to have progression orrecurrence of neurologic symptoms and signs, and they even-tually succumb to the effects of either the primary canceror neurologic dysfunction. Relapse of symptoms and signsin those patients whose neurologic disorder initially re-sponded to treatment of the underlying tumor often signifieslocal recurrence of tumor or metastatic dissemination(100,129). NECROTIZING MYELOPATHY Necrotizing myelopathy is the rarest of the central nervous system remote effects of cancer. Indeed, its existence as adistinct paraneoplastic syndrome was unknown for manyyears until several pathologically verified cases associatedwith systemic malignancies were reported (6). Clinical Features Although necrotizing myelopathy may be the initial mani- festation of an occult neoplasm, it more often develops aftera cancer has established itself. It may also occur in patientspreviously treated for cancer who have no clinical or patho-logic evidence of malignancy (154). A variety of malignancies can be associated with necrotiz- ing myelopathy, including Hodgkin's disease, lymphoma,acute leukemia, and cancers of the lung, breast, ovary, stom-ach, prostate, thyroid, and kidney (6,154-158). Affected pa-tients experience acute or, less often, subacute onset of asym-metric flaccid paresis of the lower extremities, ascendingsensory loss, and bowel and bladder dysfunction. The courseis typically rapid, with progression of deficits occurring overdays to weeks, and ultimately culminating in paraplegia anda segmental sensory level, or the clinical characteristics of aBrown-Sequard syndrome (157). Paraplegia, bulbar paresis,and respiratory failure frequently occur when the pathologicprocess extends rostrally into the cervical spinal cord andbrainstem (158). Pathology Two general patterns of pathologic abnormalities are ob- served during postmortem examination of patients with nec-rotizing myelopathy (6). Most investigations have revealedmassive necrosis of both gray and white matter within thethoracic spinal cord, with gradual tapering of the processboth rostrally and caudally. In these cases, the rostral exten-sion of the necrosis may reach the lower brainstem. In othercases, patchy multifocal regions of necrosis affecting differ-ent levels of the spinal cord are present. The necrosis insome cases preferentially affects the white matter. In thissetting, it is often with associated spongiform degenerationand demyelination. Wallerian degeneration of the affectedascending and descending tracts can also occur. Inflamma-tory changes are generally minimal and are probably causedby the necrotic process itself. Vessels are generally not af-fected by inflammation, necrosis, or thrombosis. A case ofnecrotizing myelopathy described by Lester et al. (156), inwhich a 66-year-old man with Hodgkin's disease was foundto have typical pathologic changes along with fibrinoid ne-crosis of vessel walls and vasculitis, is a notable exception. Diagnostic Evaluations The CSF is usually unremarkable in patients with necro- tizing myelopathy, but it may show xanthochromia, a fewred blood cells, a mild lymphocytic pleocytosis, and an in-creased concentration of protein. An increased concentrationof myelin basic protein was present in the CSF of the patientdescribed by Kuroda et al. (158). Early reports described normal-appearing spinal cords using myelography in patients with necrotizing myelopathy.In the case described by Kuroda et al. (158), however, theentire cervical cord showed diffuse hypointensity on T1-weighted MR imaging. Differential Diagnosis In a patient with known or suspected cancer who develops an acute myelopathic syndrome, intradural or extraduralcompression, intramedullary infiltration by metastatic dis-ease, or an opportunistic infection, must be emergently ex-cluded using MR imaging, intrathecally enhanced CT scan-ning, examination of the CSF, or a combination of thesemodalities. An acute necrotic myelopathy may rarely Late-delayed radiation-induced the spinal cord 1-4 years after exposureand causes a subacute myelopathy that progresses over sev-eral weeks to months or, in some cases, years. An acutemyelopathy can occur as part of the syndrome of para-neoplastic encephalomyelitis, as discussed earlier. Cerebrovascular complications referable to the spinal cord, as seen with a hypercoagulopathy-associated infarctor epidural hematoma causing compression, can present asan acute myelopathy. Finally, cancer patients are predis-posed to nutritional deficiencies (e.g., vitamin B 12) that can cause myelopathies, but the onset and course of these disor-ders are generally more insidious than pathogenesis of paraneoplastic unknown. The longitudinal distribution of damagePARANEOPLASTIC DISEASES OF NEURO-OPHTHALMOLOGIC INTEREST 1731 along the spinal neuraxis does not respect vascular territories supplying the spinal cord. Because of this observation andbecause of the absence of vessel occlusion in most cases, a hypercoagulopathy or cerebrovascular mechanism is un-likely. The intense vasculitis present in the case describedby Lester et al. (156) suggests that a primary inflammationmay be important for development of this unusual syndromein some patients. Support for an immunologic mechanismcomes from the report of Kuroda et al. (158), who foundincreased proportions of activated helper T-cells in the CSF, PARANEOPLASTIC PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHIES The most common cause of peripheral neuropathy in a patient with cancer is compression of a nerve trunk by a mass of tumor cells. Less commonly, neuropathies resultfrom infiltration by tumor cells of the epineurium of spinalor cranial nerve roots or peripheral nerves. Peripheral nervescan also be injured by the toxic effects of certain chemothera-peutic agents and radiation treatment. In addition, some pa-tients with malignancies develop a progressive peripheralneuropathy that is unassociated with evidence of metastatictumor or the effects of cancer treatment and is thereforethought to be a remote effect of the primary lesion, an associ-ation first recognized and described in detail by Denny-Brown (161). Paraneoplastic peripheral neuropathies usually occur in patients with known malignancies, but, like the paraneoplas-tic syndromes that affect the central nervous system, theyare occasionally the initial manifestation of the malignancy.Several types of paraneoplastic peripheral neuropathies havebeen described (3,6,162), including can occur as a neurologi- cally isolated remote effect of cancer (161,163), but it moreoften develops in the setting of a more extensive para-neoplastic encephalomyelitis (6,7,41). Isolated paraneoplas-tic subacute sensory neuronopathy is most often associatedwith small-cell lung cancer, but it also occurs in patientswith multiple myeloma, Hodgkin's disease, diffuse large celllymphoma, other cancers of the lung, and carcinomas of thebreast, ovary, and gastrointestinal tract (8,164). Paraneoplastic sensory neuronopathy often becomes symptomatic before the discovery that a systemic cancer ispresent (8,164). In a typical case, the patient experiencestingling and spontaneous pain in the limbs along with a pro-gressive sensory ataxia that eventually renders arm and legmovements very clumsy. These disturbances begin distally,but they gradually spread proximally over a period of severalweeks to months. Symptoms often begin in the arms and arefrequently asymmetric at the onset. Neurologic examinationshows distal loss of sensitivity to all primary modalities,although proprioception and vibration sense are affectedmuch more dramatically than pain and light touch sense.Loss of positional sense is usually very severe and causesand reduced proportions of suppressor-inducer T-cells in theperipheral blood of their patient at the time of onset of symp-toms. Treatment and Prognosis There is no treatment for paraneoplastic necrotizing my- elopathy. Affected patients experience rapid progression ofneurologic impairment and general deterioration, oftendying within weeks following the onset of symptoms fromcomplications related to respiratory failure or sepsis. sensory ataxia of all extremities. Muscle stretch reflexes are reduced or absent. A form of sensory neuronopathy withacute onset and rapid progression of deficits was describedby Vallat et al. (165). Some patients with subacute sensory neuronopathy have evidence of autonomic dysfunction, particularly orthostatichypotension (8,41). In fact, in some patients, symptoms re-lated to pandysautonomia or selective dysfunction of thecirculatory system, gastrointestinal tract, bladder, or sudo-motor system may be more disabling than symptoms refer-able to sensory loss (166-172). Some of these patients havetonic pupils (8,164,167-169,173-175; see below). In patients with subacute sensory neuronopathy, the CSF frequently contains an increased concentration of proteinthat ranges from 50-200 mg/dl (8,164). The CSF cell countis usually normal and there may be a mild lymphocytic pleo-cytosis. Anti-Hu antineuronal antibodies are frequently pres-ent in the serum of affected patients, especially in thosewhose underlying malignancy is small-cell cancer of thelung (41,56,176). In a series reported by Molinuevo (177),the specificity of the anti-Hu antibodies for paraneoplasticsensory neuronopathy was 99.8% and sensitivity was 82%.Electrophysiologic studies show markedly diminished or ab-sent sensory nerve action potentials, normal motor nerveconductions, and no electromyographic abnormalities(8,164,178). Some abnormalities of motor conduction andmuscle activity can be seen in severely or chronically af-fected patients. The neuropathologic findings in patients with para- neoplastic subacute sensory neuronopathy dorsal root ganglia withsecondary degeneration of the posterior roots and the dorsalcolumns of the spinal cord (164,179). In some acute cases,perivascular endoneurial inflammation is present (165).Sural nerve biopsies show loss of both myelin and axons,fibrosis, and occasional mononuclear inflammatory infil-trates around epineural vessels (8,164). In patients with dysfunction, additional pathologic changes, including interstitial and perivascular lymphocytic infiltration, loss ofneurons, and loss fibers, be observed inthe paravertebral autonomic ganglia (169). The myentericplexus is infiltrated with mononuclear cells and shows neu-ronal loss and degeneration in those patients with selectivegastrointestinal failure causing intestinal pseudo-obstruction(167,171,172).CLINICAL NEURO-OPHTHALMOLOGY 1732 SUBACUTE MOTOR NEUROPATHY Patients with subacute motor neuropathy usually have an underlying systemic lymphoma that has been diagnosed by the time symptoms of the neuropathy occur. This syndromehas rarely been described in patients with other malignancies(180). Affected patients have no significant sensory symp-toms or signs. Instead, they develop painless progressiveweakness that may be proximal or distal, symmetric or asym-metric, usually affecting the legs more than the arms (181).The weakness is associated with findings of lower motorneuron dysfunction, including fasciculations, reduction inmuscle stretch reflexes, and eventual atrophy of affectedmuscles. The bulbar and respiratory muscles are oftenspared, but when they are affected the damage is usuallynot severe. Unlike other forms of paraneoplastic peripheralneuropathies, subacute motor neuropathy usually stabilizesor may even improve spontaneously after months or evenyears, independent of the course of the underlying neoplasm. The pathologic findings in paraneoplastic subacute motor neuropathy consist of loss of anterior horn neurons, some-times accompanied by variable degrees of inflammatory in-filtrates; patchy demyelination of the spinal white mattertracts; partial degeneration columns; second-ary degeneration of ventral spinal roots; patchy and of plexuses;and neurogenic atrophy of skeletal muscle (181,182). Be-cause these features are similar to those seen in patientswith poliomyelitis, it has been suggested that paraneoplasticsubacute motor neuropathy may be caused by an opportunis-tic virus (182). Direct evidence supporting a viral mecha-nism, however, is lacking. CHRONIC PROGRESSIVE SENSORIMOTOR NEUROPATHY This paraneoplastic peripheral neuropathy is actually a heterogeneous group of conditions whose common clinicalfeature includes a relentless course of progressive loss ofmotor and sensory function over many months or even years.The clinical manifestations are nonspecific but reflect injuryof peripheral motor and sensory nerves. They include pro-gressive weakness, loss of muscle stretch reflexes, muscleatrophy, and progressive loss of sensation that is symmetricin the extremities but worse in the lower than in the upperlimbs, and worse distally than proximally. Cranial nerve dys-function is extremely uncommon. The clinical, electrophysi-ologic, and pathologic features usually reflect an underlyingaxonal-loss neuropathy but may in any one individual patientfulfill an axonal nervorum (6,162). Many of these neuropa-thies are thought to result from nutritional deficiencies orthe cachectic state induced by the neoplasm (183). Paraneoplastic sensorimotor peripheral neuropathies not infrequently develop in patients with carcinomas in a varietyof locations (6,184,185), i.e., in patients with lymphomas(186-188) and in patients with plasma cell dyscrasias, par-ticularly multiple myeloma (189-192). In most cases, thisform of neuropathy develops in patients whose malignanciesare well established and often is a terminal manifestation ofthe disease (185). There are no studies that can be used to diagnose with certainty the chronic progressive form of paraneoplastic sen-sorimotor neuropathy. Many affected patients have in-creased protein in the CSF, but the cell count and otherconstituents are otherwise normal. Because an axonal-lossneuropathy is the most frequently encountered form of thechronic progressive sensorimotor neuropathies in cancer pa-tients, nerve conduction studies usually disclose reducedsensory and motor amplitudes but with normal or onlymildly reduced velocities. The electromyogram usuallyshows evidence of denervation, particularly in the musclesof the lower extremities. When a chronic progressive sensorimotor peripheral neu- ropathy develops in a patient with a known malignancy whohas not received any neurotoxic chemotherapy, there is usu-ally little reason to look for causes other than the neoplasm.On the other hand, when the neuropathy develops before acancer declares itself at a primary or metastatic site, it isnecessary to include in the differential diagnosis the manytoxic, metabolic, nutritional, hereditary, and inflammatoryneuropathies. Some patients have an unusual multisystem disorder that includes peripheral neuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinop- athy, monoclonal gammopathy, and skin changes, called the POEMS syndrome (193,194). The peripheral neuropathy is generally a chronic progressive sensorimotor variety, associ-ated with a mild elevation of CSF protein content. Electro-physiologic studies and nerve biopsy reveal evidence of axo-nal degeneration alone or mixed axon degeneration anddemyelination. The liver, spleen, and lymphatic system arethe most commonly affected organs in this syndrome. Endo-crine dysfunction includes diabetes, hypogonadism associ-ated with impotence and gynecomastia in men, amenorrheain women, and hypothyroidism. The plasma cell dyscrasiasassociated with the POEMSsyndrome include immunoglob-ulin G (IgG) or IgA monoclonal gammopathies, usually as-sociated with lambda light chains. Most affected patientshave solitary or multiple bone lesions, usually in the spine,pelvis, and ribs. The bone lesions are usually sclerotic ormixed sclerotic-lytic. Pure lytic bone lesions and significantbone marrow infiltration by plasma cells, typical findings inmultiple myeloma, rarely occur in patients with the POEMSsyndrome. Skin manifestations include hyperpigmentation,thickening, and hypertrichosis. From 37-73% of patients with the POEMSsyndrome have swollen optic discs (193-195). Such patients generallyhave normal visual acuity and full peripheral fields(195,196). The intracranial pressure in some of these patientsis elevated when a lumbar puncture is performed, indicatingthat the disc swelling is probably papilledema. In other pa-tients in whom the intracranial pressure is normal, the patho-genesis of the disc swelling is unclear. It may be caused byinfiltration of the optic nerve or its sheath by an inflamma-tory process, or it may result from a localized increase incapillary permeability. Some patients with the POEMS syn-drome have prominent stare and upper eyelid retraction, sug-gesting thyroid eye disease (197).PARANEOPLASTIC 1733 ACUTE OR SUBACUTE SENSORIMOTOR NEUROPATHY In this group of peripheral neuropathies, the clinical syn- drome is similar to that of the Guillain-Barre \u00b4syndrome. Pa- tients develop acute or subacute weakness and numbness of the extremities associated with a variable increase in CSFprotein concentration. A mild lymphocytic pleocytosis mayalso be present. Nerve conduction velocities are characteris-tically slow in most cases, reflecting the presence of segmen-tal demyelination. The electromyogram usually does not re-veal extensive denervation, at least early in the course ofthe disorder, since axons tend to be spared during the acuteprocess. The pathologic findings in this condition are demye-lination of the peripheral nerves and spinal nerve roots, vari-able degrees of axonal loss, and sparse lymphocytic infiltra-tion in some cases. Most patients who develop the acute or subacute forms of paraneoplastic sensorimotor neuropathy have a systemiclymphoma (198-201) or one of the plasma cell dyscrasias,particularly multiple myeloma (190). An acute or subacutesensorimotor neuropathy may also occur in patients withcarcinomas and leukemias (201,435), most notably of thelung and breast (185,202). Some patients with the acute and subacute forms of para- neoplastic sensorimotor neuropathy have a rapidly progres-sive course that ends in death within several weeks to months(185,198,199,202). In other patients, the disorder appears tobe self-limited, with variable degrees of remission, includingcomplete recovery in some cases (199,201). Finally, somepatients who present with what appears to be a typical acuteor subacute sensorimotor neuropathy of the Guillain-Barre \u00b4 type appear to recover, only to relapse later. In some reportedcases of this syndrome, there have been as many as fourrelapses spread over several years. The relapsing/remittingform of sensorimotor neuropathy occurs more with carcinomas (185,202) or plasma cell dys-crasias (190). As is the case with the other paraneoplastic peripheral neuropathies, the association between the acute and subacute EATON-LAMBERT SYNDROME: A PARANEOPLASTIC DISORDER OF THE NEUROMUSCULAR JUNCTION A disorder resembling myasthenia gravis, occurring in patients with bronchogenic carcinoma, was first describedby Anderson et al. in 1953 (440). During the next decade,Eaton, Lambert, Rooke, and their associates at the MayoClinic studied the clinical and physiologic characteristics ofthis disorder in 30 patients (207-211). These investigatorsconcluded that it was associated with failure of neuromuscu-lar junction transmission but was distinct from myastheniagravis. CLINICAL FEATURES This myasthenic syndrome, also called the Eaton-Lambert syndrome, is more common in men than in women whensensorimotor neuropathies and an underlying malignancyusually poses no diagnostic problem when the primary ma-lignancy is already known at the time symptoms and signsof the neuropathy develop. When an acute or subacute senso-rimotor neuropathy develops in a patient in whom no malig-nancy is suspected, the differential diagnosis includes theGuillain-Barre in-toxication with isoniazid or nitrofurantoin). Because the acute and subacute forms of paraneoplastic peripheral neuropathy are most often associated with lympho-proliferative malignancies, it has been speculated that thepathogenesis is related to a disorder of the immune system.There is no direct evidence, however, that this is the case. CARCINOMATOUSNEUROMYOPATHY Historically, the term carcinomatous neuromyopathy was once used to describe all remote effects of cancer affectingthe peripheral nervous system that caused weakness(29,203). As the identification of specific paraneoplastic dis-orders affecting the peripheral nerves, neuromuscular junc-tion, and skeletal muscles became better characterized, thisterm became obsolete. Still, there exists a group of patientswho experience subacute onset of weakness, usually affect-ing the proximal muscles of the legs more so than the armswho have depressed or absent muscle stretch reflexes andother findings of a peripheral neuropathy and whose physicalfindings and diagnostic studies do not fulfill criteria for in-clusion into one of the peripheral nerve disorders discussedabove. Some investigators believed that this condition occursfrom the effects of malnutrition and the cachectic state asso-ciated with cancer (183,204), but there is electrophysiologicand pathologic evidence that this disorder is a to intramuscular distal axons (205,206). Carcinomatous neuromyopathy usually occurs in patients with carcinomas. It can develop either before the malignancydeclares itself or after the diagnosis of cancer has becomewell established. associated with malignancies (212). Almost all of those af- fected are adults, but children with the disorder have beendescribed (213,214). About 60% of patients have a malig-nant neoplasm, almost always small-cell lung cancer, butthis syndrome has also been described in patients with carci-noma of the breast, prostate, stomach, pancreas, kidney, andrectum; in patients with lymphoma and other lymphopro-liferative diseases; and in patients with lung cancers otherthan the small-cell variety. As is the case with most of the other paraneoplastic syndromes described in this chapter,symptoms and signs of the Eaton-Lambert syndrome fre-quently develop before there is any clinical evidence of amalignancy. Patients with the Eaton-Lambert syndrome typically pres-CLINICAL NEURO-OPHTHALMOLOGY 1734 ent with generalized weakness and easy fatigability of the proximal muscles of the limbs, especially of the hips, shoul-ders and thighs. Affected individuals often have difficultyarising from chairs, climbing stairs, and using their armsabove the head. Decreased energy and stamina are commoncomplaints. In some patients, strength can be demonstrablyimproved following a brief period of exercise, but it thendeteriorates with further sustained activity. Muscle stretchreflexes are reduced or absent but can be enhanced in somepatients following brief contraction of the appropriate mus-cle (215,216). The phenomenon of improvement in muscle strength after voluntary muscle contraction is termed facili- tation. It can be demonstrated electromyographically and is the reverse of the progressive weakness and decrementalresponse shown by affected muscles in patients with myas-thenia gravis. When present, facilitation serves to distinguishpatients with the Eaton-Lambert syndrome from those withmyasthenia gravis. Some patients experience aching, stiff-ness, and paresthesias of their affected limbs. As is the casewith myasthenia gravis, neuromuscular transmission wors-ens and weakness increases when patients with this disorderare subjected to increasing external or internal temperature.Eaton-Lambert syndrome may first show up as prolongedweakness or respiratory insufficiency after surgery in whichneuromuscular blocking agents were given. Unlike myasthenia gravis, in which ocular and bulbar signs are common, such manifestations are quite uncommonin patients with the Eaton-Lambert syndrome. Nevertheless,ptosis and both clinical and subclinical disorders of eyemovement may occur in this syndrome (217-221). O'Neillet al. (212) noted ptosis in about 50% of their patients, andabout half of the patients in this series complained of inter-mittent double vision, although significant ophthalmoparesiswas not observed in any of them. Cruciger et al. (222) exam-ined five patients with the Eaton-Lambert syndrome, all ofwhom complained of intermittent ptosis and three of whomcomplained of intermittent diplopia. Three of the patientswere noted to have ptosis at the time of examination. Inaddition, two of three patients whose eye movements weremeasured before and after exercise had saccadic velocitiesthat were normal before exercise but increased up to 40%after exercise. Thus, the extraocular muscles, like the periph-eral muscles, may show the phenomenon of facilitation.Dell'Osso et al. (223) examined saccades in five patientswith the Eaton-Lambert syndrome. All of the patients madesaccades that were similar to those made by patients withmyasthenia gravis in that the saccades were often hypometricor multiple and closely spaced. Two patients demonstratedboth saccadic facilitation and positive testing with edropho-nium chloride (Tensilon); however, all of the patients hadslow or normal saccadic velocities, rather than the super-fast velocities often found in patients with myasthenia gravis(see Chapter 21). In addition to muscle weakness and depressed muscle stretch reflexes, patients with Eaton-Lambert syndromeoften have symptoms of autonomic dysfunction, includingblurred vision, dry constipation, difficulty with urina-tion, impotence, and, infrequently, orthostatic light-head-edness. Evaluation of autonomic function affected patientsreveals evidence of both parasympathetic and sympatheticdysautonomia (224-226). Some patients with Eaton-Lam-bert syndrome have large, poorly reactive pupils that con-strict in response to topically applied dilute cholinergic ago-nists in the segmental paresis of the iris sphincter, suchpupils should not be confused with true tonic pupils (224). Diagnostic Evaluation Transient improvement of upper eyelid strength in re- sponse to intravenously administered edrophonium chlorideoccasionally occurs in patients with the Eaton-Lambert syn-drome who have ptosis, although such a response is gener-ally more characteristic of myasthenia gravis. Electromyo-graphic studies show a low-amplitude compound muscleaction potential that declines at low rates of stimulation,augments greatly at high rates of stimulation and, as notedabove, shows marked facilitation after exercise (208,211,216) (Fig. 36.9). Single-fiber electromyography revealsincreased jitter and blocking that improve as muscle unitsfire at increasingly higher rates (216,228,229). Serum antibodies directed against the P/Q- or N-type volt- age-gated calcium channel of the nerve terminal are presentin 28-75% of patients with the Eaton-Lambert syndromewho have small-cell lung cancer (230-232). The clinicalusefulness of these antibodies remains to be defined, sincethey are also present in many patients with the Eaton-Lam-bert syndrome unassociated with cancer, in some patientswith other systemic autoimmune disorders (e.g., systemiclupus erythematosus), and in patients with small-cell lungcancer who do not have the Eaton-Lambert syndrome(230-232). There are no clinical features that differentiate patients with the Eaton-Lambert syndrome associated with cancerfrom those without an underlying malignancy. However, oneshould be particularly suspicious that a patient with theEaton-Lambert syndrome has an occult malignancy if the Figure 36.9. Electromyograms in a normal person (A), a patient with myasthenia gravis (B), and a patient with the Eaton-Lambert myasthenic syndrome (C). Note the facilitation response in the myasthenic syndrome asopposed to the decremental response in myasthenia gravis during repetitivenerve stimulation.PARANEOPLASTIC DISEASES OF NEURO-OPHTHALMOLOGIC INTEREST 1735 patient also has other symptoms or findings of some other paraneoplastic syndrome, such as a peripheral neuropathy.In addition, some immunologic differences exist that mayhelp to distinguish patients with the Eaton-Lambert syn-drome as a remote effect of cancer from similarly affectedpatients without cancer. Robb et al. (233) found that patientswith the Eaton-Lambert syndrome associated with cancerhad significantly reduced numbers of OKT8/H11501 T-lympho- cytes, whereas normal control subjects, patients with cancerbut without the Eaton-Lambert syndrome, and patients withEaton-Lambert syndrome without an associated neoplasmhad normal numbers of these cells. In addition, in one pa-tient, a 72-year-old woman, the reduction in this populationof T-cells antedated clinical detection of her tumor by 5months. The prevalence of organ-specific autoantibodies,such as antithyroglobulin, antiparietal cell, and antiskeletalmuscle antibodies, is higher in patients with the Eaton-Lam-bert syndrome who do not have a malignancy compared withcontrol patients (234). Nonorgan-specific autoantibodies,such as antinuclear, antismooth muscle, and antimitochon-drial antibodies, are also found more frequently in patientswith the Eaton-Lambert syndrome who have cancer com-pared with patients who do not have cancer (235). The preva-lence of anti-voltage-gated calcium channel antibody sero-positivity is higher in patients with the Eaton-Lambertsyndrome associated with neoplasms compared with thosepatients who have no malignancy (230). Differential Diagnosis Paraneoplastic peripheral and autonomic neuropathies can cause weakness, impairment of muscle stretch reflexes, anddysautonomia, the typical triad of abnormalities that occurin patients with the Eaton-Lambert syndrome. Results ofelectrophysiologic studies will identify in most patients thecharacteristic defect of neuromuscular transmission that ispresent in this disorder and will distinguish this defect fromthe postsynaptic disturbance that occurs in myastheniagravis. Other disorders affecting the peripheral and auto-nomic nervous systems that could cause diagnostic confu-sion with the Eaton-Lambert syndrome include botulism,diabetes mellitus, chronic alcohol toxicity, Sjogren's syn-drome, amyloidosis, and the acute and chronic inflammatorydemyelinating polyradiculoneuropathies. Finally, primary muscle disorders (e.g., inclusion body myositis) and carcinomatous neuromyopathy can superfi-cially resemble the course and progression of the proximallimb weakness and sparing of bulbar muscles that occurs inpatients with the Eaton-Lambert syndrome. Pathogenesis The weakness in patients with the Eaton-Lambert syn- drome results from impaired release of acetylcholine fromthe nerve terminals (236,237), rather than fromdefective reception of acetylcholine by the postsynapticmembrane as occurs in myasthenia gravis. Acetylcholinesynthesis and mobilization are unimpaired, and the amountof depolarization produced by single quanta is normal inpatients with the Eaton-Lambert syndrome. The impairedrelease of acetylcholine results in end-plate potentials thatare too small to trigger muscle action potentials. At lowrates of stimulation, the number of quanta released and theamplitude of end-plate potentials decline, whereas at ratesof stimulation above 10 Hz there is increasing release andincreasingly large end-plate potentials. In this setting, anincrease in the concentration of calcium at the neuromuscu-lar junction or the addition of guanidine augments the releaseof acetylcholine (236,238). Electron microscopic studies ofneuromuscular junctions in mice treated with IgG from pa-tients with the Eaton-Lambert syndrome demonstrate deple-tion of the active zone, the site of synaptic vessel exocytosis,and both depletion and aggregation of active zone particlesin the presynaptic membrane (239,240). The postsynapticregion in patients with the Eaton-Lambert syndrome appearsoverdeveloped, with highly complex clefts and folds(241-243). The Eaton-Lambert syndrome appears to be an autoim- mune disorder. The target is apparently a component of thepresynaptic nerve terminal involved in the calcium-depen-dent release of acetylcholine from the active zone. An extractof small-cell lung cancer from a patient with this syndromereproduced characteristic electrophysiologic abnormalitiesfrom in vitro nerve-muscle preparations (244). In addition,several investigators reported that the defect in neuromuscu-lar transmission can be passively transferred to mice by in-jection of IgG from patients with the Eaton-Lambert syn-drome bindvoltage-gated calcium channels expressed by small-cell lungcancer cell lines are found in many patients with the Eaton-Lambert syndrome (230,247). The neuromuscular antigenagainst which these antibodies react has been cloned andfound to be homologous to a beta subunit of the voltage-gated calcium channel (248). It therefore seems likely thatthe Eaton-Lambert syndrome is caused by an antibody-me-diated autoimmune response that downregulates the voltage-gated calcium channel and thereby impairs the calcium-de-pendent release of acetylcholine from the presynaptic activezone. The production of serum antibodies against musclevoltage-gated calcium channels may be an aberrant autoim-mune response against an antigen expressed by the cancer,similar to the autoimmunity that appears important in thepathogenesis of many of the other remote effects that havealready been discussed in this chapter. Treatment and Prognosis Treatment of the underlying cancer may significantly im- prove the status of some patients with the Eaton-Lambertsyndrome (249-251). For the many others who remainsymptomatic after aggressive treatment of their malignancy,agents that enhance neuromuscular transmission are fre-quently helpful. Anticholinesterase medications, such aspyridostigmine (Mestinon), are not as effective in patientswith the myasthenic syndrome as they are for patients withmyasthenia gravis, but they are often used as first-line agentsbecause they are well tolerated. Also, these drugs are usefulin supplementing the therapeutic effect of other treatments(215,216). Guanidine hydrochloride improves neuromuscu-CLINICAL NEURO-OPHTHALMOLOGY 1736 lar transmission by raising presynaptic calcium levels, but it is not frequently used because of its high frequency ofserious adverse effects, which include bone marrow suppres-sion and hepatic and renal toxicity (215,216). Aminopyri-dines are drugs that enhance the release of acetylcholineby blocking potassium channels, thus prolonging the actionpotential and activation of voltage-gated calcium channelsat the nerve terminal; 3,4-diaminopyridine is effective andwell tolerated, and it is currently the aminopyridine of choicefor patients with the Eaton-Lambert syndrome (252). Some patients remain symptomatic despite treatment of the cancer and the use of drugs that enhance neuromuscular PARANEOPLASTIC DISORDERS OF VOLUNTARY MUSCLE Several paraneoplastic disorders are characterized by pri- mary damage to voluntary muscle, including can occur in each of these syndromes and can even bethe presenting manifestation of the condition. POLYMYOSITIS AND DERMATOMYOSITIS Polymyositis is an inflammatory myopathy that affects striated skeletal muscle and, less commonly, cardiac muscle.The diagnosis of polymyositis is based on the presence ofat least two of the following (254-255): 1. Proximal muscle weakness. 2. Elevated serum levels of enzymes such as creatine kinase, aldolase, lactic dehydro-genase. 3. An active myopathic pattern on electromyography.4. Inflammatory changes, often associated with necrosis, degeneration, and regeneration of muscle fibers, in a mus-cle biopsy specimen. When a characteristic rash is present in a patient with polymyositis, a diagnosis of dermatomyositis is made. Therash, called a heliotrope rash, is typically a violaceous andsometimes edematous eruption that affects the upper eyelidsmore prominently than the lower eyelids. In addition, pa-tients with dermatomyositis may have a flat red rash on themalar region, anterior chest, and extensor surfaces over largejoints. Violaceous papules and scaly plaques, called Got-tron's papules, characteristically appear over joints, mostcommonly the knuckles. Nonspecific nail bed changes de-velop, including periungual telangiectasias and cuticular ir-regularity and thickening (256). Both the rash and weaknessof dermatomyositis usually evolve subacutely and appearsimultaneously. The rash may, however, be an isolated phe-nomenon that develops shortly before the weakness occurs.The weakness that occurs in both polymyositis and dermato-myositis primarily affects the proximal limb muscles, al-though there may also be involvement of the neck flexorsand the pharyngeal musculature. The muscles innervated by cranial nerves are usually not affected and, therefore, ophthalmoplegia and ptosis almosttransmission. In this are beneficial (215,216,253). Unfortunately, both formsof therapy have major disadvantages. Immunosuppressivetherapy has the disadvantage of delayed action, whereasimmunomodulating treatments have the disadvantage of pro-viding only temporary responses. Despite the many drugsthat can be used to treat patients with the Eaton-Lambertsyndrome, most patients with this disorder eventually be-come severely debilitated from weakness before their even-tual death from their underlying cancer (212). never occur in either polymyositis or dermatomyositis, al- though some unique exceptions have been reported.(257-260). Ophthalmologic abnormalities may occur in patients with dermatomyositis. The most common abnormality is a reti-nopathy that is characterized by diffuse cotton wool spots(soft exudates) and both deep and 7-34% of adult patients with dermatomyositis or polymyositis also have an underlying malignancy (255,270-275). The wide variation in the reported frequency ofthis association is due, in part, to differences in populationbiases and methodologies among the many studies that haveinvestigated this issue (276). Although Lakhanpal et al. (273)suggested that the association between malignant tumors anddermatomyositis or polymyositis may be fortuitous and notsignificantly higher than that which would be expected inthe normal population, the bulk of epidemiologic evidencesupports a relationship between the inflammatory disorder(especially dermatomyositis) and the underlying cancer(275-279). The range of tumors that occurs in association with derma- tomyositis and polymyositis is extensive. Most are carcino-mas, with the most common being carcinomas of the breast,ovary, endometrium, or cervix in women, and carcinoma ofthe lung, prostate, bladder, or gastrointestinal tract in men(270,271,280). Hodgkin's disease, non-Hodgkin's lym-phomas, leukemias, and multiple myeloma also occur witha higher frequency in patients with polymyositis and derma-tomyositis than in the normal population (279). Althoughother types and sites of malignancies have been sporadicallyreported in patients with dermatomyositis or polymyositis, the number of reports is too small to determine whether ornot there is a true association between these other malignan-cies and the inflammatory myopathies. In most series, cancer-associated dermatomyositis or polymyositis occurs slightly more often in women than inmen, with the highest incidence occurring in adults over 50years of age (270,271,274,279-281). Although childrenwith malignancies and dermatomyositis or polymyositishave been described, the number of cases is extremely small. When a malignancy is present in a patient with dermato-PARANEOPLASTIC DISEASES OF NEURO-OPHTHALMOLOGIC INTEREST 1737 myositis or polymyositis, the tumor is usually identified within the first two years following the diagnosis of theinflammatory myopathy, although longer intervals havebeen described (280). Nevertheless, some investigators(271,276,279) suggest that if a malignancy is not present oris discovered within a year or two from the time that thediagnosis of dermatomyositis or polymyositis is made, thenthe patient has the same risk of developing a malignancy asdoes an otherwise healthy person of the same age and sex. Some clinical and laboratory features may suggest that a patient with dermatomyositis or polymyositis has an under-lying malignancy. Patients with paraneoplastic myositis, forexample, tend to be older than patients without an associatedmalignancy (271,272), although this phenomenon may sim-ply reflect the age-dependent frequency of cancer in the gen-eral population. On the other hand, it is clear that patientswith dermatomyositis or polymyositis who have evidenceof a connective tissue disease or interstitial pulmonary fibro-sis are unlikely to have an associated malignancy (278),whereas patients who have a normal concentration of cre-atine kinase in the serum at the time of diagnosis of dermato-myositis have an increased risk of malignancy (436). Antinu-clear antibody seropositivity is more common in patientswith dermatomyositis without cancer than in patients withparaneoplastic dermatomyositis (437). Antibodies to Jo-1,an extractable nuclear antigen that is highly specific to poly-myositis and dermatomyositis, is not generally found in af-fected patients who have associated cancers (283). Since some investigators question whether or not there is a true relationship between malignancy and dermatomyositisor polymyositis (273) and since studies affirming a relation-ship between cancer and these inflammatory myopathies de-scribe a wide variety of types and sites of associated malig-nancies, the physician faced with an adult patient who haseither dermatomyositis or polymyositis must decide to whatextent that patient should undergo an evaluation for an occultneoplasm. Many investigators advocate performing a com-plete physical examination, including a rectal examinationin all patients, pelvic and breast examinations in women,and routine hematologic and serum biochemical studies asthe initial approach to such patients and to then obtain furtherinvestigations only if indicated by the results of the initialevaluation (273,276). Some investigators also suggest ob-taining a chest x-ray in all patients, mammography inwomen, and an assay for prostate-specific antigen in men;however, most do not recommend additional or exhaustivenon-goal-directed investigations for an occult malignancy(277,278,281,282). In patients with dysphagia, it is impor-tant to exclude carcinoma of the esophagus or gastroesopha-geal junction before attributing the symptoms to the myositis(281,282,284). Additional concern that a patient might beharboring an occult malignancy seems prudent if the patientis elderly, does not respond initially to standard treatment,or experiences an unexplained flare-up of disease duringtreatment. Polymyositis and dermatomyositis are probably autoim- mune diseases (285,436). The rash and selective damage tothe heart, lungs, and peripheral joints are also manifestationsof other autoimmune disorders, and abundant evidence hasaccumulated that supports the role of both humoral and cellu-lar immune-mediated mechanisms of muscle injury, al-though the relative contributions of each differ in dermato-myositis and polymyositis (277,281,282). A variety ofmyositis-specific autoantibodies, of which anti-Jo-1 is themost common, are found in the serum of about 33% of af-fected patients. These antibodies target certain cytoplasmicproteins and ribonucleic acids involved in protein synthesis(286). Their pathogenetic role is uncertain, however, sincethe specific in vivo muscle target antigens and factors thatinitiate self-sensitization are unknown (277). Other evidencethat supports an autoimmune basis for dermatomyositis andpolymyositis includes the development of disease in somepatients following a viral illness or vaccination, the favorableresponse of most patients to immunosuppressant therapies,and the production of a similar disease in animals usinginjections of muscle antigens and adjuvant. The standard initial therapy for patients with paraneoplas- tic dermatomyositis and polymyositis is treatment with sys-temic corticosteroids. This therapy results in resolution ofthe skin rash and reduction in weakness in most patients,although the ultimate prognosis is related to the success orfailure of treating the underlying neoplasm. Other forms oftreatment, including cytotoxic agents (288,289), and intravenous also been used with variable success. ACUTE NECROTIZING MYOPATHY Acute necrotizing myopathy is a rare and, often times, rapidly fatal noninflammatory disorder that occurs in associ-ation with various carcinomas (57,292-296). Affected pa-tients experience rapidly progressive proximal weakness as-sociated with painful and tender muscles and, in many cases,difficulty swallowing and breathing. Elevated serum creatinekinase and urine myoglobin concentrations are present. Mus-cle necrosis without an inflammatory component character-izes the major pathologic findings. The features that differen-tiate acute necrotizing myopathy from polymyositis includethe rapid course, presence of myoglobinuria, lack of re-sponse to corticosteroid treatment, and absence of inflamma-tion on muscle biopsy in the former condition. The pathogen-esis of acute necrotizing myopathy is unknown. There is notreatment for the progressive necrotic process. Death occursin most patients within several weeks to months followingthe onset from complications related to inability to swallowor respiratory failure. CACHECTIC MYOPATHY This condition is characterized by severe, diffuse muscle wasting and loss of subcutaneous fat, with relative preserva-tion of strength in the affected muscles. Myoedema may bepresent, and the muscle stretch reflexes may be depressed.In its extreme form, this disorder is progressive and severelydebilitating to the point that respiration is impaired. Neitherthe extraocular muscles nor the muscles that serve eyelidfunction are generally affected. The combination of proximalweakness and loss of muscle stretch reflexes can cause diag-CLINICAL NEURO-OPHTHALMOLOGY 1738 nostic confusion with carcinomatous neuromyopathy, al- though generally appear well nourished in the lattercondition. Cachectic myopathy occurs most often as a paraneoplastic process in patients with a variety of carcinomas and lym-phomas. It also occurs in patients with other chronic debili-tating diseases, such as tuberculosis. Histologic studies performed on affected muscles in pa- tients with cachectic myopathy reveal extensive two patterns of atrophy of musclefibers. In the first type, single atrophic fibers or groups offibers are randomly distributed throughout the affected mus-cle, with fast twitch fibers being more severely affected. Inthe second type of atrophy, all fibers served by a specificmotor unit are atrophic (3). The pathogenesis of the muscle wasting in cachectic my- opathy is unknown. It does not result from disuse or starva- tion. Instead, it may result from a combination of high-en-ergy consumption by the tumor and a metabolic derangementof muscle. Interestingly, carcinoma in rats is associated withmuscle wasting that is at least partially mediated by elevatedintracellular protease activity (298). A similar phenomenonmight occur in humans. PARANEOPLASTIC RIGIDITY, THE STIFF-MAN SYNDROME, AND NEUROMYOTONIA In the setting of a known or suspected neoplasm, a patient may experience progressive rigidity of the trunk and limbs from one of three paraneoplastic disorders: encephalomyeli- tiswith predominant spinal cord involvement, an unusual syndrome called the stiff-mansyndrome, andneuromyotonia (305). Progressive rigidity in the setting of encephalomyeli-tis is discussed above. In this section, we discuss the para-neoplastic stiff-man syndrome and paraneoplastic neuro-myotonia. STIFF-MAN SYNDROME Stiff-man syndrome is a disorder characterized by pro- gressive symmetric stiffness and spasms affecting the mus-cles of the trunk, abdomen, and proximal extremities thatproduces an awkward posture and gait appearance fromwhence the name of the disorder was derived (306-308).The facial and bulbar muscles are usually spared in this con-dition. Early symptoms include muscle aching and tightness.Later, intermittent intense painful spasms of affected mus-cles, lasting minutes at a time, are typically precipitated byvarious stimuli, such as sudden loud noises or passivestretching of an affected limb. Physical findings include anawkward appearing and cautious gait from lumbar hyper-lordosis and fear of painful spasms, and tight hard paraverte-bral and abdominal muscles. Motor, sensory, cranial nerve,cerebellar, and muscle stretch reflex functions are generallyotherwise normal apart from hyperreflexia. Symptoms are abolished during sleep. Electromyographic findings include continuous motor unit activity when thepatient is trying to relax the tested muscle. The presence ofcontinuous motor unit activity, absence of other peripheralor central nervous system physical findings, and partial reliefThere is no specific treatment for paraneoplastic cachectic myopathy. Dietary supplements may slow the process, butthey rarely reverse it. The prognosis is poor unless the under-lying tumor can be cured. ENDOCRINE MYOPATHIES Skeletal muscle is an important endocrine target organ that may be damaged in certain metabolic disorders that occurin association with cancer (299). A steroid myopathy maydevelop in patients with ACTH-secreting tumors and thyrotoxic thyroid gland carcinoma or small-cell lungcancer. In both of these conditions, the extraocular musclesmay be affected. A particularly important, although rare, myopathy occurs in patients with carcinoid tumors (300-302). The myopathyis characterized by severe proximal muscle weakness. Ad-ministration of cyproheptadine, an antagonist of both seroto-nin and histamine, improves muscle strength, suggesting thatincreased levels of serotonin may be responsible for thismyopathy (303,304). Neither the eyelids nor the extraocularmuscles are affected in carcinoid myopathy. of symptoms using agents that either reduce central catechol- amine activity (e.g., clonidine) or enhance central gamma- aminobutyric acid activity (e.g., diazepam or baclofen) allsuggest that the stiff-man syndrome results from a brainstemor spinal cord imbalance of these two neurotransmitter sys-tems (308). The frequent association of insulin-dependentdiabetes and other organ-specific autoimmune disorders inpatients with stiff-man syndrome further suggests that thisdisorder may have an immune-mediated basis. In fact, manypatients with stiff-man syndrome have circulating autoanti-bodies to gamma-aminobutyric acid neuron terminals, pan-creatic beta cells, and other organs using in vitro assaysystems (309,310). The antigen these autoantibodies targetappears to be a component of glutamic acid decarboxylase,the rate-limiting enzyme in the production of gamma-amino-butyric acid within neurons. There is an apparent relationship between stiff-man syndrome and cancer, particularly small-cell lung cancer,adenocarcinoma of the breast, and Hodgkin's disease(310-312); however, it is unclear from the available reportswhether the progressive rigidity and spasms that these pa-tients have are due to a true stiff-man syndrome, as definedby Lorish et al. (308), or paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis.In fact, the 71-year-old man described by Bateman et al.(35), who experienced progressive asymmetric stiffness andspasms of the extremities 6 months before small-cell lungcancer was discovered, ultimately had postmortem findingsof the spinal cord that were typical of paraneoplastic enceph-alomyelitis. Considerable clinical and electrophysiologic overlap ex- subacute myelitis causing rigid-ity and the stiff-man syndrome, suggesting the two con-PARANEOPLASTIC DISEASES OF NEURO-OPHTHALMOLOGIC INTEREST 1739 ditions might share common pathogenetic mechanisms. Common features of both conditions include the presenceof progressive hypertonia, stimulus-evoked and spontaneouspainful spasms of affected muscles, and electromyographicevidence of continuous involuntary motor unit activity.Some clinical differences between stiff-man syndrome andsubacute myelitis can be used to differentiate these two dis-orders. The rigidity of stiff-man syndrome begins insidi-ously, progresses slowly over months to years, predomi-nantly involves the lumbar, abdominal, and proximal limbmuscles, is distributed symmetrically, and tends to plateauand stabilize after a period of progression. In contrast, therigidity associated with paraneoplastic myelitis begins moreabruptly, progresses faster over a period of days to weeks,generally affects the extremities, is distributed asymmetri-cally and segmentally, and continues relentlessly. In addi-tion, the neurologic findings in stiff-man syndrome are usu-ally limited to the motor system, whereas the central nervoussystem injury that occurs with paraneoplastic myelitis fre-quently affects the nerves, reflex NEUROMYOTONIA Acquired neuromyotonia, also called Isaacs' thesyndrome of continuous muscle fiber activity,o r pseudo- myotonia, is a disorder of unknown cause that produces con-tinuous muscle activity and delayed relaxation following ac-tive contraction (313,314). The continuous motor unitactivity is caused by peripheral nerve hyperexcitability andthus persists during sleep, may or may not be eliminated byperipheral nerve block, and is abolished by curare. Neuro-myotonia can develop in association with clinical or electro-physiologic evidence of a peripheral neuropathy or as a neu-rologically isolated syndrome. Affected patients typicallyexperience progressive stiffness and twitching of muscles,cramping and increased stiffness with use of the extremities,and, during ambulation, difficulty relaxing the muscles fol-lowing use, difficulty ambulating, and excessive perspira-tion. Abnormal physical findings include continuous myo-kymia and fasciculations of affected muscles, hypertonia,a stiff awkward-appearing gait with extended extremities,reduced muscle stretch reflexes, and prolonged contractionof muscles following exercise (pseudomyotonia). Weaknessand wasting of muscle bulk are generally not present in neu-romyotonia. In contrast to the stiff-man syndrome (seeabove), the distal and proximal limb muscles, the facial mus-cles, the bulbar muscles, and the extraocular muscles can beaffected. Also in contrast to stiff-man syndrome, the motorfindings of neuromyotonia persist during sleep. Electrophys-iologic abnormalities in this condition include continuous PARANEOPLASTIC SYNDROMES INVOLVING THE EYES AND OPTIC NERVES Three main paraneoplastic conditions can produce vi- sual symptoms and signs from specific damage to ocular structures. These are the paraneoplastic retinopathies,paraneoplastic optic neuropathy, and paraneoplastic tonicpupils.motor unit discharges (e.g., and myokymia) and muscle fiber discharges (e.g., high-frequency repetitivedischarges), as well as afterdischarges following direct com-pound muscle action potential or in response to voluntarycontraction or percussion. Intrathoracic malignancies, most notably lung cancers and thymomas, are occasionally found in some adults with ac-quired neuromyotonia (315-322). Acquired neuromyotoniadeveloped before the discovery of an IgM plasmacytoma inthe patient reported by Zifko et al. (323). At autopsy, thispatient did not have evidence of peripheral neuropathy,spinal cord abnormality, or immunoglobulin depositionwithin skeletal muscle. A syndrome consisting of neuromyotonia, symptoms of cholinergic hyperactivity (e.g., hyperhidrosis and toxic en-cephalopathy), acetylcholine receptor antibody seropositiv-ity, and benign or malignant thymus tumors has been de-scribed. Some affected patients have no evidence ofmyasthenia gravis (318,320[Case 1]), whereas others haveclinical withdysfunction of the neuromuscular junction (319,320[Case2],322). It is suggested that paraneoplastic acquired neuro-myotonia is caused by an autoimmune-mediated paradoxicfacilitation of cholinergic neuromuscular transmission. It isimportant to determine whether or not a patient with thy- moma-associated neuromyotonia has clinical or electrophys-iologic evidence of myasthenia gravis since the use of anti-cholinesterase agents in this setting can cause deteriorationof motor function (320[Case 2]). An autoimmune pathogenesis of paraneoplastic acquired neuromyotonia is further supported by the temporary im-provement of symptoms following plasmapheresis, by theidentification in some patients of circulating antibodiesagainst voltage-gated potassium channels, and by the obser-vation that mice injected with IgG from some affected pa-tients show enhanced release of acetylcholine at motor end-plates and increased resistance of neuromuscular transmis-sion to tubocurarine (314,324,325). This evidence suggeststhat at least some cases of paraneoplastic acquired neuro-myotonia are caused by the production of autoantibodies thatinterfere with the ion channels that regulate nerve membraneexcitability. Phenytoin and carbamazepine are often effective in reduc- ing the symptoms of neuromyotonia. Plasmapheresis hasbeen used to provide temporary improvement in motor func-tion in particularly severely affected patients. The overallprognosis of paraneoplastic neuromyotonia is related to theprognosis of the underlying malignancy, although some pa-tients experience improvement of symptoms coincident withtreatment of their neoplasm (315,318[Case 1],321). PARANEOPLASTIC RETINOPATHIES Visual loss from retinal degeneration as a remote effect of systemic cancer was first described in 1976 by Sawyer et al. (326) who reported three patients who initially com-CLINICAL NEURO-OPHTHALMOLOGY 1740 plained of episodic blurring and dimming pho- topsias, and nyctalopia, and who subsequently experiencedslowly progressive, bilateral visual loss initially character-ized by constriction of the visual fields, paracentral scoto-mas, and eventual loss of central vision. The appearanceof the fundi in these patients was initially unremarkable;however, with time, the retinal arteries became markedlynarrowed. In one of the patients, an electroretinogram (ERG)was flat. All three patients eventually died from small-celllung cancer. At autopsy, the eyes of all three patients showedtotal degeneration of the retinal photoreceptors with preser-vation of the inner layers of the retina. Sawyer et al. (326)postulated that the degeneration of photoreceptors that oc-curred in these patients was cause by the distant effects oftheir neoplasms and emphasized that in two of the threepatients, the neoplasm was not known to be present at thetime visual symptoms began. Since this initial report of patients with what is now called cancer-associated retinopathy (CAR), numerous additional patients have been described, and numerous scientific inves-tigations have been performed, expanding the clinical spec-trum of cancer-associated retinal degenerations and clarify- ing their pathogenesis. It is now clear that paraneoplasticdisorders causing visual loss through retinal dysfunction en-compass many distinct conditions that can be differentiatedfrom each other in life by their unique clinical characteris-tics, electrophysiologic abnormalities and, occasionally, bytheir immunologic profile (327,328). The term paraneoplas- tic retinopathy is most appropriate to use when referring to these disorders in general. When possible, a more specificdiagnostic term should be applied to the visual demise ofan individual patient who has retinal dysfunction as a remoteeffect of cancer (Table 36.3). In the following section, wediscuss the various individual paraneoplastic retinopathysyndromes now recognized as distinct entities. Cancer-Associated Retinopathy Cancer-associated retinopathy (CAR) is the most fre- quently encountered primary visual paraneoplastic disorder.Patients with this condition develop symptoms and physicalfindings referable to both cone and rod dysfunction in theabsence of other neurologic symptoms usually harbor small-cell lung cancer and often have circulating autoantibodiesagainst certain retinal proteins (329[Case 1],330-340). Clin-ical manifestations of cone dysfunction include photosensi-tivity and prolonged glare following light exposure, loss ofvisual acuity and color discrimination, and central scotomas.Clinical manifestations of rod dysfunction include nightblindness and prolonged adaptation to a dark environment,and peripheral or ring scotomas. Table 36.3 Classification of patients with CAR experience progressive symp- toms of cone and rod dysfunction, often preceded by or asso- ciated with transient dimming of vision, bright or colorfulphotopsias, or bizarre entoptic symptoms. One of our pa-tients described seeing flame-like flickers of light in his pe-ripheral field, large white amoeba-shaped objects obstruct-ing his central field of vision, and illusions that he likenedto raindrops striking a foggy automobile windshield. Mostpatients will admit to photosensitivity if specifically ques-tioned. They often note that their vision is better at twilightor if they wear dark sunglasses. Symptoms are often experi-enced in both eyes at the onset. When the onset is reportedas only affecting one eye, similar symptoms occur in thefellow eye within a period of days or weeks. As with many of the other paraneoplastic syndromes dis- cussed above, symptoms of photoreceptor dysfunction usu-ally begin several months before or around the time of dis-covery of the underlying malignancy. The majority ofpatients with CAR have small-cell carcinoma of the lung,although the disorder can occur in patients with other lungneoplasms (332[Case 2],341,342); cancers of the cervix(330), uterus and breast (346); andin patients with metastatic carcinoma of unknown origin(347[Case 1]). An exceptional patient described by Matsuiet al. (347) developed CAR five years after the discoveryof prostate, bladder, and laryngeal cancer. Retinopathy hasbeen described in a 24-year-old patient with Hodgkin's lym-phoma who had serum antibodies that reacted with a 65-kdphotoreceptor protein (348). Typical physical findings in patients with CAR include bilateral reduced visual acuity, impaired color discrimina-tion, and a pattern of visual field loss that includes centralscotomas, ring scotomas, both, or more extensive peripheralloss with retained islands of vision (Fig. 36.10). The poste-rior pole often appears normal when a patient is evaluatedshortly after he or she has begun to experience visual symp-toms. However, within weeks to months, the fundi showa variety of abnormalities, including arteriolar narrowing,retinal pigment epithelial thinning and mottling, and pallorof the optic discs (Fig. 36.11). Other abnormal ocular abnor-malities that may develop in patients with CAR are cellsin the vitreous and anterior chamber, sheathing of retinalarterioles, periphlebitis, and nonspecific changes in the ap-pearance of the retinal pigment epithelium. The cone and rod-mediated ERG responses are generally nonrecordable or significantly attenuated by the time an af-fected patient seeks medical care and is evaluated by a physi-cian who suspects that the presenting symptoms and physicalfindings are referable to retinal dysfunction. The CSF mayshow a mild lymphocytic pleocytosis and an increased con-centration of protein. These abnormalities, however, are non-specific. As one would predict based on the clinical and ERG ab- normalities in patients with CAR, pathologic studies revealdegeneration of photoreceptors in all affected patients(326,330,331,338-340). The most conspicuous abnormalityis marked loss of cones and rods with virtually completedegeneration and loss of the cells of the outer nuclear layer(cell bodies of the photoreceptors) (Figs. 36.12 and 36.13).PARANEOPLASTIC DISEASES OF NEURO-OPHTHALMOLOGIC INTEREST 1741 Figure 36.10. Kinetic perimetry in a 65-year-old woman with a several-month history of progressive loss of vision in both eyes, photosensitivity, and improved vision when wearing dark sunglasses. She had abnormal visual acuity and color vision in both eyes, mild narrowing of the retinal vessels, and asymmetric visual field abnormalities that included central scotomas,ring scotomas, and more extensive midperipheral loss. Electroretinography confirmed cone and rod dysfunction. An anteriorneck mass that she had discovered around this same period of time was biopsied and found to be an invasive follicularadenocarcinoma of the thyroid.

(From Bu-chanan TAS, Gardiner TA, Archer DB. Anultrastructural study of retinal photoreceptor degen-eration associated with bronchial carcinoma. Am J Ophthalmol 1984;97/H11018277-287.) Any remaining photoreceptors, especially those around the fovea, show severe disintegration of the inner and outer seg-ments. Scattered melanophages are seen in the outer retinallayers. The inner retinal layers, including the ganglion cells,are preserved. Inflammation, vascular changes in the retinaand choriocapillaris, and optic nerve degeneration and demy-elination are conspicuously absent in this condition. Like so many of the other paraneoplastic disorders dis- cussed above, CAR appears to be an autoimmune process.Circulating antibodies to human retinal photoreceptors wereidentified in the serum of the patient reported by Keltner etal. (330). In three additional patients later examined by Thir-kill et al. (332), serum reacted in high titers against saline-solubilized extracts of normal human, rat, and bovine retinaas well as pooled bovine and human choroid, but there wasno reaction using lens or iris extracts as the test antigen.Only low background readings were produced by serumfrom normal persons and patients with cancer but withoutloss of vision. Selective immunostaining of the outer retinausing serum from patients with CAR adds further supportfor the autoimmune nature of this disorder (Fig. 36.14) (338).Kornguth and colleagues (329,349,350) found antibodiesagainst retinal ganglion cells in two patients with visual para-neoplastic disorders and small-cell lung cancer, one of whomPARANEOPLASTIC DISEASES OF NEURO-OPHTHALMOLOGIC INTEREST 1743 Figure 36.14. Immunoreactivity of the cancer-associated retinopathy (CAR) antibody, using serum from a patient with small-cell lung cancer and rapid loss of vision in both eyes, reacting on rhesus monkey retina.Strong immunofluorescent staining is seen in the outer segments (OS) ofthe photoreceptors, but not in the outer nuclear layer (ON), inner nuclearlayer (IN), or ganglion cell layer (GC). (Courtesy of Charles E Thirkill,Ph.D.) had clinical and electrophysiologic abnormalities consistent with photoreceptor degeneration and another who had clini-cal and pathologic evidence of an optic neuropathy (351).In these patients, the antibodies recognized four protein anti-gens in extracts of both retina and small-cell lung cancer.These have 145,000,65,000, and 20,000-24,000 daltons. These molecularweights are similar to those of the proteins in the neurofila-ment triplet of neural cells, and it has therefore been hypothe-sized that the neural antigens are released in response torapid growth or necrosis of the tumor and that they thentrigger the production of antibodies against similar or cross-reacting antigens contained on neuronal cell surfaces(349,350). However, antineurofilament antibodies are foundin some normal subjects and in patients without cancer whohave other retinal degenerations, such as retinitis pigmentosaand age-related macular degeneration (328). Even if this hy-pothesis is correct, it does not appear to explain the findingof pure photoreceptor degeneration rather than degenera-tion of ganglion cells in the eyes of patients with this para-neoplastic syndrome. Using immunoblot analysis, an antibody to the 23-kd pro- tein, the so-called CAR antigen, is found in the serum ofmost (352), but not all (338), patients with CAR . Antibodyhas also been recovered from aqueous humor (353). Thegene encoding the CAR antigen has been isolated using anti-CAR serum (354), and subsequent nucleotide sequence anal-ysis demonstrates extensive homology of this protein calcium-dependent protein that modu-lates photoreceptor guanylyl cyclase (438). Otherinvestigators have confirmed that recoverin is the autoanti-gen against which serum from affected patients reacts(339,355). Thirkill et al. (356) demonstrated that culturedsmall-cell lung cancer cell lines express an antigen com-pletely homologous with the 23-kd CAR antigen and sug-gested that cross reactivity between cancer and retina pro-teins is responsible for initiating the immune-mediatedsubsequent cascade of events that ultimately leads to photo-receptor degeneration. Polans et al. (357) demonstrated thatrecoverin was, in fact, expressed by small-cell lung cancerin a patient with CAR who had circulating anti-recoverinantibodies. These studies strongly implicate an autoimmunemechanism initiated by the expression of recoverin in a sub-set of patients with CAR who have small-cell lung cancerand perhaps other tumors. The immune response againsttumor-associated recoverin may also generate an immuno-logic response against photoreceptor-associated recoverin,which in turn may cause immune-mediated photoreceptordegeneration. McGinnis et al. (358,359) proposed a hypothesis for CAR as a single mutational event, such as a deletion or transloca-tion, that inactivates a copy of the p53 tumor suppressorgene, which turns on the synthesis of a recoverin proteinwith the cell line becoming cancerous because of the lossof the tumor's suppressor activity of the p53 protein. Ohguro and Nakazawa (360) propose that retina specific recoverin is aberrantly expressed in cancerous tissues andrecognized by immunocytes leading to production of an anti-body against recoverin. The circulating antibody reaches theretina and penetrates photoreceptor cells where it specifi-cally binds and blocks recoverin function, resulting in en-hancement of rhodopsin phosphorylation by antibody retinal cells induced apoptosis through the mitochondrialpathway involving caspases 9 and 3. Maeda et al. (362) dem-onstrated that co-injection of caspase inhibitors with anti-recoverin antibody inhibited rhodopsin phosphorylation. Some patients with CAR produce antibodies against other proteins (363-365), including enolase (366), although thesignificance of these other reactions is less clear than thatassociated with the CAR antigen. Ohguro et al. (367) foundantibodies against heat shock cognate protein 70 (hsc 70) insera from patients with CAR. Hsc 70 belongs to a family ofproteins synthesized in response to a variety of cellularstresses and plays an important role as a chaperon, assistingin (a) translocation of proteins into organelles, (b) correctCLINICAL NEURO-OPHTHALMOLOGY 1744 folding and rearrangement of proteins, (c) dissolution of pro- tein aggregates, and (d) protein degradation. The fact thatnot all antibodies associated with CAR recognize the sameantigens suggests that this disorder is not a single entity butrather a group of autoimmune conditions whose pathogene-sis results in photoreceptor degeneration. Over 20 antigenshave been described in the CAR syndrome. These antigensare found in retinal rods, cones, and ganglion cells, and inthe optic nerve. CAR should be considered in any adult patient who devel- ops progressive visual loss suggestive of retinal dysfunctionin the setting of a malignancy, particularly small-cell lungcancer. In addition, patients who begin to develop progres-sive loss of visual function in a pattern consistent with retinaldysfunction (e.g., preservation of visual acuity with constric-tion of the visual field or development of paracentral or ringscotomas; development of unexplained photosensitivity ornyctalopia; progressive narrowing of retinal arteries), unex-plained loss of cone function (e.g., loss of visual acuity;color vision; central scotomas), or unusual unexplained pho-topsias or other entoptic symptoms should undergo electro-retinography to determine if a diffuse process of retinal pho-toreceptors is present. If the ERG is abnormal and if thereis no family history of retinitis pigmentosa or similar disease,such patients should undergo a complete systemic evaluationwith particular attention to the lungs, breasts, and pelvicorgans. There is no effective therapy for this paraneoplastic photo- receptor degeneration. Most patients lose virtually all vision,and this may occur months or even years before they suc-cumb to the effects of their malignancy. Some patientstreated with corticosteroids will show modest improvementof visual function, although this improvement is rarely sus-tained. Plasmapheresis reduced the titers of circulating com-plement-fixing antiretinal antibodies in a patient reported byThirkill et al. (335) with CAR and small-cell lung cancer,but it did not produce any visual improvement. Guy andAptsiauri (368) demonstrated improvement in visual acuityin two of three patients with CAR treated with intravenousimmunoglobulin. Cancer-Associated Cone Dysfunction In contrast to the marked impairment of both cone and rod function that characterizes the clinical and electrophysio-logic presentation of a patient with CAR, some patients ex-perience symptoms and findings that reflect injury only tothe cone system. Cogan et al. (369) described a 72-year-oldwoman who developed sudden photosensitivity and sub-acute loss of vision. She noted that her vision was betterwhen wearing dark sunglasses. In addition to impaired visualacuity, she also had an absolute loss of color perception,central scotomas, and attenuated retinal vessels. The ERGshowed suppression of cone responses. She had no otherneurologic symptoms. MR imaging gave normal results, butexamination of the CSF revealed a mild lymphocytic pleo-cytosis. The patient's visual symptoms and findings did notrespond to a brief trial of corticosteroids. Evaluation of abloody vaginal discharge a few months after the onset ofher visual symptoms revealed small-cell endometrial cancer. She died 2 months later from widespread intraabdominalspread of the tumor. Postmortem examination of the retinarevealed a diffuse loss of cones, most marked in the maculaand associated with infiltration of the remaining layers ofthe retina by pigmented macrophages. Similar cases havebeen reported (370-372). Circulating antibodies against reti-nal proteins, including the CAR antigen and a protein whosemolecular weight is 50 kd, were demonstrated in the patientreported by Jacobson and Thirkill (372). Although rare, a visual remote effect of cancer should be considered when evaluating an adult with an unexplainedacquired cone dysfunction syndrome, especially in the ab- sence of a positive family history for a similar disorder orin the setting of a known or suspected malignancy. Melanoma-Associated Retinopathy A specific retinopathy caused by the remote effect of cuta- neous malignant melanoma can be clinically distinguishedfrom the two paraneoplastic retinopathy syndromes dis-cussed above, because the symptoms and findings in thisretinopathy reflect dysfunction of rods. Patients with thismelanoma-associated retinopathy (MAR) experience suddenshimmering, flickering, or pulsating continuous or intermit-tent photopsias, difficulty seeing in the dark, and occasion-ally floaters or photosensitivity (373-384). Symptoms maydevelop in both eyes at the same time, or they may beginmonocularly, only to be followed by similar symptoms inthe fellow eye within a period of a few weeks to months. Unlike the marked impairment of visual acuity, color vi- sion, and central visual field that typifies the cone dysfunc-tion of most patients with CAR, patients with MAR oftenretain near normal visual acuity, color vision, and centralvisual field. In some patients, however, loss of visual acuityoccurs, and mild abnormalities along the red-green axis,blue-yellow axis, or both can be demonstrated using sensi-tive measures of color vision (e.g., the Farnsworth-Munsell100-hue or D-15 panel tests). The visual field may be entirelynormal, or it can show a generalized depression, peripheralconstriction, or contain midperipheral or paracentral scoto-mas. Central scotomas, commonly found in patients withCAR, are unusual in patients with MAR. The posterior polemay appear completely normal, although narrowing of reti-nal vessels, nonspecific changes of the retinal pigment epi-thelium, and pallor of the optic discs are often noted in pa-tients with symptoms that have been present for severalmonths. Infrequently noted ophthalmologic findings includevitreous inflammation, round and oval-shaped white lesionsat the level of the outer retina or retinal pigment epithelium,diffuse retinal pigment epithelium loss of pigment, smallatrophic lesions involving the retina, choroid and retinal pig-ment epithelium, and retinal phlebitis (385-387). Cerebro-spinal constituents were normal in both patients evaluated byWeinstein et al. (383). Vitiligo was documented in a patientdescribed by Borkowski et al. (387). Unilateral MAR hasalso been reported (388). Many other differences between CAR and MAR exist.PARANEOPLASTIC DISEASES OF NEURO-OPHTHALMOLOGIC INTEREST 1745 Men are more frequently affected in MAR compared with the more evenly distributed gender involvement in CAR. Incontrast to the relentless loss of visual function that occurs inpatients with CAR, patients with MAR often do not developsignificant progression of retinal dysfunction despite persis- tence of night blindness and photopsias, although exceptionsoccur (383,385,386). In contrast to patients with CAR whosesymptoms often occur before the underlying neoplasm isrecognized, most patients with MAR already have an estab-lished diagnosis of cutaneous malignant melanoma for a fewmonths to as long as several years at the time they developnight blindness and photopsias. Metastatic disease is oftendiscovered within several months before or after the onsetof visual symptoms, although this association may simplyreflect the unpredictable nature of disseminated melanomaor the fact that once a patient is diagnosed as having MAR,he or she may undergo a more intensive search for metastaticdisease than might be performed as part of a routine onco-logic follow-up. Kelter et al. (389) reviewed the clinical and immunologi- cal findings of 62 patients with MAR. Age at onset of visualsymptoms ranged from 30-78 years (average 57.5 years).Visual acuity of 20/60 or better was initially present in 82%of patients in their review. Fundus examination was normalin 44%, optic disc pallor was present in 23%, and retinalvessel attenuation was present in 30%. Vitreous cells in 30%. The latency from diagnosis of melanoma torecognition of MAR syndrome averaged 3.6 years. Jacobsen and Adamus (390) reported a 51-year-old woman with progressive visual glare for 1 year who hadnormal visual acuity and color vision, paracentral scotomas,and a normal-appearing retina. ERG revealed no responsesof the right eye and attenuated responses in the left eye,especially under scotopic conditions. Anti-bipolar antibodieswere detected. Subsequent evaluation revealed colon adeno-carcinoma. After tumor resection and chemotherapy, no evi-dence of anti-bipolar antibodies was found and ERG re-sponses were markedly improved. The ERG in MAR reveals a characteristic set of abnormal- ities that includes a markedly reduced or absent dark-adaptedB-wave with preservation of the A-wave, resulting in a re-sponse dominated by a negative-appearing waveform(376,377,379,380,382). The light-adapted B-wave responsemay be normal or show a reduced amplitude or delayedimplicit time but usually not to the same abnormal degreeas that response obtained under scotopic conditions. Defectsin the function of cone ''ON''-center bipolar cells and blue-sensitive cones occur in some patients (377,380,385,439),and there is even some evidence that the damage is restrictedto those cells that are part of the magnocellular pathway(391,392). Finally, oscillatory potential amplitudes are re-duced. This pattern of ERG abnormalities is similar to thatobserved in some forms of congenital stationary night blind-ness and is consistent with failure of neural transmissionfrom rods, and some cones, to the inner retina. Patients with MAR have circulating IgG autoantibodies that show specific immunofluorescent staining of some, butnot all, human rod bipolar cells (Fig. 36.15) (380,383,389, 393,394). Although it has not been proven that these antibod-ies directly cause retinal dysfunction, the immunologic andelectrophysiologic abnormalities in patients with MAR sug-gest that the disease is caused by the production of antibodiesagainst melanoma that cross-react with retinal bipolar cells,a process that somehow interferes with neural retina trans-mission from the photoreceptors through the inner retina.The antigen against which these antibodies react is unknown,although some evidence suggests that the bipolar cell antigenis a lipid, not a protein (328). Gittinger and Smith (395)performed histopathologic studies on both eyes of a 59-year-old man who had visual loss due to MAR and who died ofmetastatic cutaneous melanoma. They reported a markedreduction in the density of bipolar neurons in the inner nu-clear layer, transsynaptic atrophy of ganglion cells, and nor-mal outer nuclear layer photoreceptor cells (Fig. 36.16). No specific therapy for MAR exists. Corticosteroids do not appear to improve symptoms or reverse the ERG abnor-malities. Similarly, treatment of the primary tumor or ofmetastatic disease does not alter the progression of visualsymptoms. The overall prognosis is related to the behaviorof the malignancy. Keltner et al. (389) reported that sevenpatients had improvement of vision with treatment, espe-cially with intravenous immunoglobulin and cytoreductivesurgery. A visual remote effect of cancer should be considered in any patient with a cutaneous malignant melanoma whodevelops sudden or subacute night blindness, unexplainedphotopsias, or peripheral visual field loss. An ERG will indi-cate if such symptoms are caused by rod dysfunction, thecharacteristic abnormality associated with MAR. Althoughsimilar abnormalities can also be observed in patients withcongenital stationary night blindness, juvenile retinoschisis,vincristine toxicity, and central retinal artery or vein occlu-sion, these disorders should be distinguished by a completepersonal and family history and ophthalmologic examina-tion. Conversely, a careful dermatologic examination is indi-cated in a patient with clinical and electroretinographic ab-normalities suspicious for MAR but who does not have anestablished diagnosis of cutaneous malignant melanoma. Ifno malignancy is identified, and no alternative explanationfor the symptoms exists, then periodic surveillance is war-ranted. A patient with established melanoma who developsMAR should be evaluated frequently for evidence of dissem-inated disease. Diffuse Uveal Melanocytic Proliferation Diffuse uveal melanocytic proliferation (DUMP) differs from the paraneoplastic retinopathies described above be-cause cellular infiltration, not degeneration, is responsible for the symptoms and findings that characterize this syn-drome. Bilateral proliferation and infiltration throughout theuveal tract by benign melanocytes occurs in this unusualvisual remote effect of cancer.

The same population of bipolar cells is labeled with both markers. (Courtesy of Ann H Milam, Ph.D.) quent histopathologic observations indicate that the infil- trate is composed of more benign-appearing melanocytes(401-403). DUMP occurs equally often in women and men and is associated with a number of seemingly unrelated carcino-mas, especially ovarian cancer in women (398,401,404-406) and a variety of lung malignancies in men (399,401,403,407-409). Other patients with DUMP may havecancer of the cervix (405), uterus (400), colon and rectum(401,410), gallbladder (402), and retroperitoneal space(396). In some cases, there may be evidence of metastasesfrom a primary tumor whose location cannot be determined(397,401,411). Visual loss precedes identification of the un-derlying malignancy in about one-half to two-thirds of casesby a few months to a few years. In those patients with estab-lished cancer, symptoms referable to DUMP occur from 1month to as long as 6 years after the malignancy is diag-nosed, although they most often develop within the first year. Patients with DUMP experience slow, painless, progres- sive, bilateral (but often asymmetric) loss of vision overseveral months. The visual loss is primarily caused by outerretinal damage from subretinal infiltration and exudative ret-inal detachment caused by the melanocytic proliferation, butit can also result from the secondary development of cata-racts, iridocyclitis, and glaucoma. Gass et al. (405) summa-rized five major signs that characterize this disorder:PARANEOPLASTIC DISEASES OF NEURO-OPHTHALMOLOGIC INTEREST 1747 Figure 36.16.

Multifocal hyperfluorescence during fluorescein angiog- raphy corresponding to these lesions (Fig. 36.17). 3. Multiple slightly elevated pigmented and nonpigmented Figure 36.17. The DUMP syndrome. Fluorescein angiography from a 66-year-old woman with carcinoma of the uterus who experienced loss of vision in both eyes during a 2-month period of time, showing multiple earlyhyperfuorescent lesions in the posterior pole of her left eye that corre-sponded with orange spots seen ophthalmoscopically. (From Gass JDM.Stereoscopic Atlas of Macular Diseases. Diagnosis and Ed 3,Vol 1. St. Louis, CV Mosby, 1987/H11018189.)uveal melanocytic tumors and diffuse thickening of the uveal tract (an early or late finding). 4. Exudative retinal detachment (a late finding). 5. Rapidly progressive cataract formation. Systemic findings, apart from those associated with the underlying malignancy, generally do not occur, althoughsome patients develop hyperpigmented lesions of the oralmucosa, penis, and skin (409,410). Chahud et al. (412) reviewed 20 cases of DUMP. The average patient age was 63 years (range 34-89 years). Therewere 13 women and 7 men. In approximately 50% of thecases, visual symptoms preceded those of the associatedtumor, which frequently was a poorly differentiated carci-noma. The most common types of tumors were ovarian car-cinomas and uterine tumors in females and pulmonary tu-mors in men. All five inciting tumors whose histopathologywas reviewed expressed neuron-specific enolase. Orbital echography in patients with DUMP may reveal evidence of acquired hyperopia, diffuse choroidal thicken-ing, or discrete subretinal masses. Electroretinographyshows nonspecific reduction of amplitudes, often affectingthe scotopic responses more than the photopic responses, atleast in early cases. The differential diagnosis of DUMP includes inflamma- tory and neoplastic disorders that infiltrate the choroid changes of the outer retina observed in patients withDUMP may also be spectrum of DUMP varies considerablyCLINICAL NEURO-OPHTHALMOLOGY 1748 from case to case. Macroscopically, the entire uveal tract, including the iris, ciliary body, and choroid, appear diffuselythickened. Retinal detachment is commonly seen. The in-filtrating cells are usually small and spindle-shaped, butthey are occasionally rounded or epithelioid, and dark-staining, benign-looking nuclei(399,401-403,405,406,411). These cells stain positive withS-100, indicating their epithelial origin, and they containpigment granules of various density. Mitotic figures are rare.More malignant-appearing epithelioid cells suggesting ma-lignant melanocytic transformation are rarely observed(404,409). Areas of necrosis are often present, usually asso-ciated with melanophages. The retinal pigment epitheliumand photoreceptors show degeneration. The choriocapillarisis not affected in this condition. The pathogenesis of DUMP is unknown. Some investiga- tors speculate that the presence of a systemic neoplasm uveal melanocytic infiltration or or bysome other oncogenic stimulation factor that initiated thegrowth of the underlying malignancy (401,403,413). Sucha mechanism, however, cannot account for the melanocyticproliferation that occurs in some ocular structures normallydevoid of melanocytes (e.g., the posterior corneal surface).Gass et al. (405) hypothesized that patients with DUMP havebilateral diffuse congenital uveal melanocytic nevi that areclinically silent until their cancer develops and causes prolif-eration and melanin production through some hormonal in-fluence. This hypothesis does not explain how or why cata-ract formation, retinal detachment, and photoreceptordegeneration occur in this syndrome. These extra-melano-cytic manifestations might be caused by local toxic or im-mune-mediated reactions that develop in response to theuveal proliferation (411). No effective treatment exists to halt the progressive bilat- eral loss of vision that occurs in patients with DUMP. Nei-ther treatment of the underlying malignancy nor the use ofcorticosteroids improves vision. The overall prognosis is re-lated to the systemic malignancy. There is one case of apatient with DUMP retaining useful vision in one eye fouryears after undergoing ocular irradiation and drainage ofsubretinal fluid (414). Uveomeningitic Syndromes Rudge (415) described a 49-year-old woman who lost vi- sion in both eyes and was found to have bilateral macularedema associated with mild anterior uveitis. She was treatedwith systemic and topical corticosteroids, but over the next7 days her vision continued to worsen, as she developedbilateral optic disc swelling associated with large centralscotomas. Lumbar puncture revealed a normal opening pres-sure. The CSF contained 200 lymphocytes/mm 3, a mildly increased concentration of protein, and no malignant cells.A palpable breast mass discovered at this time was removedone month later and found to be a primary carcinoma. Aftersurgery, the patient experienced a dramatic improvement invisual acuity from 20/80 to 20/20 in both eyes within 1month. Within 5 months both the swelling of the optic discsand the edema of the macula had subsided in each eye. Arepeat examination of the CSF 8 months after the onset ofsymptoms was normal. Gass (416) reported a 71-year-old woman who experi- enced severe visual loss associated with floaters and nyctalo-pia, as well as headaches, cutaneous vitiligo, during a 2-week period. A cutaneous melanoma hadbeen removed from the sole of her foot 3 years earlier. Ab-normal findings in both eyes included visual acuity of lightperception, unreactive pupils, cells within the anterior cham-ber and vitreous, keratic precipitates, multiple patches ofyellow-white retinal depigmentation, narrowed retinal arteri-oles, and optic disc swelling. She also had cutaneous vitiligoand poliosis of her head and limbs, inguinal adenopathy,hearing loss, and mild confusion. An ERG was extinguishedin both eyes. The CSF contained 130 lymphocytes/mm 3and had an increased protein concentration. Biopsy of an ingui-nal node showed metastatic melanoma. She was thought tohave suffered an acute autoimmune reaction against the me-lanocytes of the uveal tract, meninges, skin, and ear. Hervisual acuity improved after she received 80 mg prednisonedaily for several days. A few weeks later, visual acuity was20/70 in both eyes. When the prednisone was discontinued1 month later, the vision deteriorated within several weeksto counting fingers in each eye. Prednisone was restarted,and the visual acuity promptly recovered again. The patientmaintained good vision while receiving prednisone for thenext 15 months until she died from metastatic melanoma.Although this patient had melanoma and evidence of retinaldysfunction, several of her clinical features differed fromthose observed in patients with typical MAR, including theassociated systemic abnormalities, meningeal reaction, vis-ual response to corticosteroids, optic disc swelling, and de-pigmentation of the retinal pigment epithelium. The abnor-mal ERG responses, however, suggest that the visual lossof this patient was caused, in part, by damage to the outerretinal neural elements. Antoine et al. (417) described a 61-year-old woman who developed visual loss in both eyes and was found to havebilateral posterior uveitis and a severe vitreous reaction.Breast carcinoma had been diagnosed and treated 6 yearsearlier, and the patient was in complete remission at thetime of her visual presentation. The vision in her right eyeresponded to topically applied corticosteroid treatment butdeteriorated every time the dose was tapered. Fluoresceinangiography performed 14 months after the onset of her vis-ual loss revealed staining of retinal blood vessel walls and ofthe optic discs on both sides. One month later, she developedfurther loss of vision in her right eye, dysarthria, nystagmus,ataxia, abolished muscle stretch reflexes, and orthostatic hy-potension with evidence of dysautonomia. Electrophysio-logic studies confirmed a peripheral neuropathy. Cerebrospi-nal fluid contained 40 white cells/mm 3and no malignant cells. Metastatic carcinoma was discovered about 1 yearlater. She died from complications associated with DIC. Atautopsy, her cerebellum showed severe loss of Purkinje cells.A few perivascular lymphocytic cuffs were observed in thecerebral white matter, spinal cord, and sensory ganglia. Theoptic nerves were normal. Permission to examine the retinaPARANEOPLASTIC DISEASES OF NEURO-OPHTHALMOLOGIC INTEREST 1749 was not granted. It would seem that this patient developed posterior uveitis and a vitreous reaction several months be-fore she developed paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis and asensory neuropathy. In view of this report and the othersdescribed above, it seems reasonable to consider the possi-bility of an underlying malignancy in any patient who devel-ops an uveomeningitic syndrome. PARANEOPLASTIC OPTIC NEUROPATHY Paraneoplastic optic neuropathy results in a subacute, pro- gressive, bilateral loss of vision, usually without accompany-ing pain. The optic disc is edematous or normal in appear-ance. The optic chiasm can also be involved. cerebellar infiltration of the optic nerves and ischemicoptic neuropathy must be ruled out. Paraneoplastic opticneuropathy is very rare. As of 2002, only 18 cases of para-neoplastic optic neuropathy had been reported. Neuropathol-ogic findings reveal nonspecific vascular infiltration of theoptic nerve by lymphocytes as well as axonal loss or demye-lination of the optic nerve (Fig. 36.18). Paraneoplastic optic neuropathy can also be associated with a subacute cerebellar syndrome (418). Most of thesepatients have a serum antibody specific for a recently defined62-kd neuronal antigen named collapsing response-media- tor protein-5 in 36.18. Paraneoplastic optic neuropathy in a 61-year-old woman with carcinoma of the breast who rapidly lost vision in the right eye and was thought to have central nervous system metastasis. A,The right optic nerve is totally demyelinated. The demyelination extends into the optic chiasm and affects the portion of the left optic nerve as it enters the chiasm. B,There is severe perivascular infiltration by lymphocytes, similar to that seen in multiple sclerosis. Moderate gliosis is present, indicating that the lesion is old. (From Lindenberg R, Walsh FB, Sacks JG. Neuropathology of Vision: An Atlas. Philadelphia: Lea &Febiger, 1973/H11018253.)tral and peripheral neurons, including synapses. The CRMP family of proteins is thought to mediate growth guidancecues during neurogenesis. The CRMP-5 antibody was foundto be present in serum as frequently as anti-Yo and lessfrequently than anti-Hu. In all, 116 patients whose sera con-tained antibodies found to including 10% loss was inflammatory in 86%,and CRMP-5 antibodies in 37% equaled or exceeded serumtiters. Lung carcinoma (mostly small-cell) was found in 77%of patients, and thymoma was found in 6%. Basal gangliaabnormalities were evident by MRI imaging and at autopsyin a subset of patients with chorea and CRMP-5 antibodies(419). Cross et al. (420) described the characteristics of 16 pa- tients with CRMP-5-associated combined optic neuritis andretinitis in greater detail. All were smokers. Their agesranged from 52 to 74 years at presentation; 11 had small-cell lung carcinoma; vision loss was subacute and painlessin 15 patients and was bilateral within weeks or months.Some patients reported blurred or dimmed vision; othersreported spots or flashes, dazzling vision, or tunnel vision.Visual acuities ranged from 20/20 to 20/400. Visual fieldabnormalities disc photographs, fluorescein images, and vitreous biopsy. A, Right eye shows severe acute optic disc swelling with tortuous vessels, cotton woolspots, and nerve fiber layer hemorrhages. B andC,Late arterial fluorescein image shows dye leakage on disc surface (B), and latephase shows dye persistence at the disc andperivenous fluorescence, indicating vascularincompetence (C). DandE,Left eye shows chronic disc swelling, optic atrophy with dyeleakage (D), and vascular incompetence re-mote from (E). F,Pleomorphic cellu- larity with reactive lymphocytosisin right eye and eosin,/H11503400). (From Cross SA, Salomao DR, ParisiJE, et Paraneoplastic by CRMP-5- IgG. Ann Neurol 2003;54/H1101838-50.) and generalized depression. Chronic or subacute optic disc swelling was noted in all but one patient. Nerve fiber layerhemorrhages were common. Fluorescein angiography re-vealed hyperfluorescence of the optic disc and leakage ERG abnormalities included prolongationof the scotopic photopic flicker The presence of cells in the posterior vitreous wasnoted in 9 of the 16 patients. No patients had pars planitis.These vitreous cells were found to be CD4 /H11501reactive lym- phocytes. All patients had other neurological signs or symp-toms at some point in their illness. These included mentalstatus changes, cranial neuropathy, motor and sensory prob-lems, and Cerebrospinal con-tained lymphocytes, elevated oligoclonalimmunoglobulin bands, and CRMP-5 antibody. No patientshad recoverin antibodies. Acute or subacute vision loss with optic disc swelling and vitreous cells can occur in other types of disease states inaddition to paraneoplastic optic neuropathy. These includevasculitis, infectious or postinfectious inflammatory disor-der such as bacterial or viral infections, infiltrative etiologiessuch as sarcoid and lymphoma, and demyelinating diseasesuch as multiple sclerosis or Devic's disease. A diversegroup of patients without malignancy who produce antibod-ies that are reactive with optic nerve and/or retina have alsobeen described. This syndrome has been called autoimmune-related retinopathy and optic neuropathy syndrome by Kelt-ner (421). Many of these patients also have one or moresystemic autoimmune diseases. These patients may be moreresponsive to treatment with steroids or other immunomodu-lators. Adult patients with unexplained subacute painless vision loss, optic disc swelling, and cells in the posterior vitreous(with or without subacute cerebellar ataxia) should have acomplete neurological examination and evaluation of theserum and cerebrospinal fluid for CRMP-5 antibodies andother antibody markers of paraneoplastic disease (420). IfCRMP-5 antibody is found, a work-up for lung cancershould be initiated. Treatment of the specific cancer in patients with para- neoplastic optic neuropathy with chemotherapy and/or radia-tion therapy resulted in significant visual improvement(422-424). Some improvement in vision has also been dem-onstrated with steroids (65,425,426). TONIC PUPILS Tonic pupils develop as a remote effect of cancer in the following three settings: (a) in patients with autonomic neu-PARANEOPLASTIC DISEASES OF NEURO-OPHTHALMOLOGIC INTEREST 1751 ropathy, with or without other clinical or electrophysiologic evidence of sensory neuropathy (8); (b) in patients with theEaton-Lambert syndrome as a component of the dysautono-mia that frequently accompanies that disorder (212,226,227)(see above); and (c) in one reported case of a child withneuroblastoma and paraneoplastic opsoclonus-ocular flutterand myoclonus (136,427). Most cases of paraneoplastic tonic pupils are bilateral and are found during evaluation of a peripheral neuropathy thathas preceded the diagnosis of an underlying malignancy.Baumann (173) described a patient with a severe sensoryneuropathy who had bilaterally dilated, unreactive pupils.Small-cell lung cancer was detected 7 months later. At au-topsy, there was severe degeneration of dorsal root ganglioncells and posterior columns. The ciliary ganglia were notstudied. Similar cases were subsequently reported (164,167,178,428,429). Maitland et al. (174) described two patients with tonic pupils in the setting of malignancy. The first patient devel-oped bilateral tonic pupils (Fig. 36.20), first in his left eyeand later in the right eye over a 6-month period, associatedwith evidence of a subacute progressive sensory neuropathy.Eight months after his visual and sensory symptoms began,he was found to have an adenocarcinoma of the colon. Thesecond patient also had bilateral tonic pupils in the setting Figure 36.20. Paraneoplastic tonic pupils in a 32-year-old man with distortion of smell and taste, anorexia, nausea, and vomiting after meals. He also had a dysesthetic sensation over the left posterior scalp and complained of blurred vision in both eyes. Neurologic examination revealed left hemiparesis, diminished position, vibration, pain sensation on the left side, andleft-sided dysmetria. Deep tendon reflexes were exaggerated in the right arm and leg, but they were absent at the left kneeand ankle. There was anisocoria with the right pupil smaller than the left. The right pupil was normally reactive, and the leftpupil was poorly reactive to light and near stimuli. Electroneuromyography showed absent sensory nerve action potentials butnormal distal motor latencies and conduction velocities. A showed mild, nonspecific axon loss and myelindisruption. Over the next 4 weeks, the right pupil became dilated, irregular, and nonreactive to light or near stimuli, whereasthe left pupil became smaller and showed light-near dissociation. A,The right pupil is large and irregular at rest. B,After instillation of dilute (0.125%) pilocarpine, the pupil shows marked constriction. Eight months after symptoms began, the patientcomplained of abdominal pain and was found to have a malignant polyp of the colon. (From Maitland CG, Scherokman BJ,Schiffman J, 1985;5:99-104.)of orthostatic hypotension and other evidence of autonomic dysfunction. She was eventually found to harbor small-celllung cancer. A tonic pupil was also present in a patient withstage IIA Hodgkin's disease who developed severe ortho-static hypotension, dry mouth, constipation, and urinary patient's orthostatic hypotension improved slightly,bowel and bladder function became normal, and her mouthbegan to feel less dry. The tonic pupil remained. Bell (175) described a 51-year-old man who developed a unilateral tonic pupil during an exacerbation of chronicrelapsing polyneuropathy. The subsequent finding of metas-tasis from a prostate carcinoma suggested that both the poly-neuropathy and the tonic pupil were paraneoplastic pro-cesses. The patient died from bronchopneumonia. Atautopsy, no tumor was found in the central or peripheralnervous system. There was, however, a severe primary pe-ripheral polyneuropathy characterized by marked axonal andmyelin loss affecting the sural, radial, and tibial nerves. Thisprocess was associated with marked, secondary ascendingdegeneration of neurons within the dorsal ganglia, tracts ofthe dorsal columns, and cell bodies of the nucleus cuneatusand nucleus gracilis in the medulla. There was also second-ary chromatolysis and loss of anterior horn cells. In some cases of paraneoplastic autonomic neuropathy,CLINICAL NEURO-OPHTHALMOLOGY 1752 an autoimmune mechanism is likely, with the reaction being directed against autonomic ganglion cells. Bell and cowork-ers (430-432) demonstrated that ofthe lung regularly in neurons of parasympathetic myentericplexuses. Lennon et al. (170) identified circulating antibod-ies that reacted against neurons of the myenteric plexus insome patients with small-cell lung cancer who had intestinalpseudo-obstruction, including one patient (Case 3) who alsohad dilated pupils. Although antibodies against cells withinthe ciliary ganglion have not been identified in any patientswith this syndrome, it is likely that they are present. Regard-less of the precise pathophysiology, the occurrence of bilat-eral tonic pupils in a patient with other evidence of auto-nomic dysfunction, sensory neuropathy, or unexplainedcentral nervous system symptoms may be the first sign ofan underlying systemic malignancy.
