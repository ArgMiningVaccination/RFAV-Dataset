Along with a series of articles specifically devoted to research on whole systems, we also devote several articles to investigations of a single integrative therapy, homeopathy. It seems unusual in a journal devoted to integrative medicine to focus an issue so exclusively on one mode of complementary treatment or research design, but in this case, it is entirely justifiable. It has been the position of this journal since its first issue that integrative medicine comprises conventional medicine working together with nutrition, supplements, exercise, and mind-spirit care, incorporating the insights and practices of complementary medicine, traditional non-Western medicine, and alternative medicine, when appropriate, directly with conventional approaches. (1) Integrative medicine is a whole system, with multiple component parts working together toward the maximum benefit of the patient. As such, research methods that evaluate whole systems have great potential to shed light on its processes and outcomes, and selecting the best evaluation approaches to determine what is appropriate for integration is crucial to the field. It is also true that the complementary, traditional, and alternative techniques incorporated into integrative medicine are, on their own, whole systems. Some of these, by virtue of their age, will have had more time to evolve as a system than modern-day integrative medicine. Homeopathy, now more than 200 years old, is an example of one such system that focuses on the whole person rather than the disease. Even systematic therapies may include subsystems that have, on their own, the characteristics of whole systems: acupuncture as a subsystem of traditional Chinese medicine is an example. Homeopathy has a number of approaches that are derived from the classical, whole person approach. Homeopathy is a particularly useful system to examine in the context of an issue on evidence hierarchies. It has a history of scientific studies of many sorts, including laboratory work, observational studies, randomized trials, and even multiple meta-analyses, and thus provides the raw materials to examine the contributions of different levels of the evidence hierarchy to clinical decision making. The study of homeopathy also provides an interesting cross-cultural perspective on a complementary medical system. Although it is often vilified as unscientific in the United States, it is widely used in Europe and is extensively used in India, South America, Australia, and elsewhere. (2,3) Additionally, intriguing work in India, including a best case series analysis performed for the US National Cancer Institute, suggests positive results for homeopathy in cancer therapy at an Indian clinic. Discussing whole systems research with homeopathy as a primary example gives this issue an innovative, thought-provoking, and international perspective that we hope will be fruitful for all our readers. Evidence Hierarchies and Integrative Medicine The term evidence-based medicine (EBM) has become a synonym for \"good\" or \"scientific\" in medical research in the past 25 years. As such, it has the capability of both supporting and denying the value of medical practices. EBM is commonly presented in the context of the \"hierarchy of evidence.\" In this arrangement, information from systematic reviews (SRs) of randomized controlled trials is judged as the \"best\" evidence for making decisions about patient care. (4) This is followed by individual randomized controlled trials (RCTs), then by nonrandomized trials, observational and retrospective studies, case-series, and qualitative research in that order. For subjects that cannot be studied through clinical research, the top of the evidence hierarchy is considered laboratory research that allows for specific causal assumptions and mechanisms to be tested, and for dependent and independent variables to be isolated through experimental methods. In both cases, this arrangement values, above all, evidence at the top of the hierarchy, and lower levels are considered inferior. Thus, quality is largely defined by design. Poor-quality RCTs and SRs may trump better quality observational studies, simply because their design puts them above others in hierarchy. (5) Clinical and laboratory experiments that isolate additive, causal links between theoretically selected aspects of an intervention and outcome of an illness become the \"gold standard,\" and all other information is considered less valuable. It is clear that this approach to EBM misses emergent properties of complex systems when those system components lose their power if separated into parts. Healing approaches and many complex integrative systems of medicine present exactly such complex systems. (6) Healing is defined as the process of recovery, repair, and reintegration that persons and biological systems continually invoke to establish and maintain homeostasis and function. (7) These processes are the most powerful force we have for recovery from illness and the maintenance of well-being and so the most important for clinical practice. Healing models do not postulate specific or direct casual links to disease, because they target inherent adaptogenic responses and assume that redundancy and multiple pathways are an inherent characteristic of every system. (8) We know from placebo and behavioral medicine research, for example, that manipulation of the social and cultural context, practitioner-patient-family communication strategies, the physical environment, and simpler verbal and nonverbal information can markedly change outcomes, often to a much greater extent than specific drugs or surgical treatments, especially in chronic disease. (9,10) In fact, integrative treatment systems may explicitly use such behavioral research in adapting to the needs of their patients, for example, determination of whether patients are \"monitors\" or \"blunters\" before delivering news of a cancer diagnosis or recurrence, so that the level of detail can be tailored to the preferred style of handling distressing information. (11) What then is the appropriate strategy for the investigation of integrative medicine and complex systems that focus on enhancement of healing capacities? Can the isolation of specific treatment-outcome links provide viable information for clinical practice? In this issue, we explore whether the best complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) research (as defined by the evidence hierarchy) can answer useful clinical questions or if more pragmatic approaches are needed. To illustrate this, we present several articles from recent work on \"Whole Systems Research\" on CAM and cancer from several authors and then highlight recent research in the field of homeopathy from laboratory research with the same question in mind. Structure of the Issue This theme issue is divided into 2 sections. The theme is whether \"top of the evidence hierarchy\" approaches--clinical and laboratory research--have, so far, moved us toward answering relevant questions about the use of complementary medicine and to explore alternatives to those approaches in complementary medicine for cancer. Whole Systems Clinical Research In section I, we explore some current alternatives to the \"top of the hierarchy\" strategies for the clinical evaluation of cancer. We have asked Ian Coulter, senior scientist at Samueli Institute and RAND, to summarize current standards for evidence summary in clinical research, their pros and cons, and what additional information is needed for clinical decision making in integrative medicine. The basic question is whether clinical research on CAM using randomized placebo-controlled trial designs is the best strategy for making evidence-based decisions about its use in clinical practice. Other articles in this section describe approaches for the study of whole systems of integrative medicine in cancer. Verhoef and Fonnebo lay the background and rationale for what they call \"Whole Systems Research\" (WSR), a concept being developed through ongoing discussions with a group of researchers highlighted at a conference with the same name in Norway 1 year ago. They describe how similar concepts to WSR have been called for from a variety of disciplines and investigators from nursing to primary care groups to policy regulators to CAM investigators. These approaches to WSR are not only important in CAM and integrative medicine but are key in any complex, multimodal system. Thus, harmonization of terms and standards from these various groups is needed. This article is followed by a WSR protocol for the study of \"acupuncture care\" (the complete system of acupuncture, a subsystem of traditional Chinese medicine) by Price, Lewith, and Thomas. The protocol describes a 2-phase, mixed-method approach, the goal of which is to prepare for a patient-relevant, practice-grounded, pragmatic randomized controlled trial of such care in cancer patients with fatigue after chemotherapy. The protocol illustrates how the principles of WSR could be applied to a real-world problem, addressed with a complex intervention and used to develop hypothesis testable questions of relevance to patients and practitioners. Such a study might lay the groundwork for similar studies on full integrative systems that focus the energies of the patient and the practitioner on a comprehensive approach to health and illness, grounded in nutrition, physical care, mind-body, and complementary approaches throughout the entire course of disease and treatment. Would approaches like this develop a new gold standard for practice decisions? The last 2 articles in the first section outline models for the evaluation of whole systems in integrative medicine research. Bell and Koithan propose that theories and methods from complex systems and network science be used to \"understanding factors that lead to good versus poor individual global outcome patterns and to rational triage of patients to one type of care over another.\" They suggest that, \"The growing reliance on complex systems thinking and systems biology for cancer research affords a unique opportunity to bridge between the CAM and conventional medical worlds with some common language and conceptual models.\" They describe several examples of complex pattern change after homeopathic therapy and outline how detailed multilevel outcomes analysis could provide a more holistic research framework for evaluating integrative medicine. The application of the approach of Bell and Koithan to comprehensive healing environments, also based on systems thinking, (11) will be a welcome challenge. Jonas, Coulter, and Beckner then describe what such an integrated evaluation approach might look like. Their \"Integrated Evaluation Model for Healing\" proposes a practice-based data collection and integration system that collects information on both process and outcome of complex practices at the sociological, psychological, clinical, and biological levels. These data sources are then integrated into a single data management and interface system that allows for cross-level analysis of practice and outcome. Such a system would be of use both for quality improvement of complex practices and for determination of what and when a randomized controlled trial is appropriate. The approach is similar to those being developed for conventional care as a component of the NIH Roadmap for interdisciplinary research teams: http://nihroadmap.nih.gov/researchteams/. Top of the Hierarchy Research in Homeopathy Section II explores the other gold standard of biomedical research--laboratory research--and asks whether basic science adds value to the debate resurrected by a recent meta-analysis of clinical research on homeopathy published in The Lancet. (12) In that debate, Shang et al published a meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials of homeopathy and found that the evidence indicated homeopathy worked no better than placebo. The Lancet editors declared the future of homeopathy and further research on homeopathy to be dead--as if that meta-analysis was the definitive study on the subject. Examination of the Shang study, however, showed that it was based on an almost identical data set from another meta-analysis published in The Lancet 8 years previously by Linde et al. (13) The Linde meta-analysis came to the opposite conclusions--that homeopathic treatments did not look like placebo. Both studies used high-quality top of the hierarchy methods. Subtle and largely arbitrary selection criteria explained the opposite conclusions of the 2 studies. Statistical sensitivity analyses in the first study had already shown that it would be practically impossible to answer the question of placebo in heterogeneous clinical studies of homeopathy using meta-analytic techniques. (13) Thus, we have an example of an impasse in top of the hierarchy methods for a widely used CAM approach. In other words, the best meta-analytic methods don't provide useful information for clinical decision making. Interestingly, in the subsequent debate over The Lancet publications, a key comment made by both Shang and Linde is that the way forward involved pragmatic clinical trials comparing the whole system of homeopathic practice (rather than the remedy) with standard conventional care. Because several longitudinal observational studies report significant and sustained improvements from homeopathy in clinical practice, it seems appropriate that the next step in homeopathic research should be pragmatic randomized controlled trials of the whole system of practice. (14,15) Top of the Hierarchy Laboratory Research in Homeopathy The second top of the hierarchy approach one could take with homeopathy to get around the placebo impasse could be high-quality laboratory studies. In the second half of this issue, therefore, we present recent research examining the effects of laboratory studies of homeopathy in cancer. This section contains a series of laboratory studies that report both positive and no effects from homeopathy in cell and animal models of cancer. Three studies are from the laboratory of Radha Maheshwari at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences. The first study is a large carefully done, properly powered and blinded in vivo study that followed up 2 pilot tests. The study found a significant reduction in prostate cancer growth from treatment with a set of homeopathic remedies recommended by clinical practitioners compared to a water-treated control group. This is quite a remarkable finding and requires independent replication. When common molecular mechanisms for cancer were examined in tissue from these animals ex vivo in the second study, no significant changes were found. This and the third study finding no effects from any of the remedies on prostate or breast cells in vitro raise questions about the origin of the findings of the in vivo study. The whole-animal study could, of course, have just been a chance finding (there will be positive results in 5 studies per 100 at the P = .05 level), and there may be other molecular mechanisms for cancer death that were not accounted for in the ex vivo studies. The fourth study is by MacLaughlin and Amri from Georgetown University and colleagues. This carefully designed and executed in vitro study examined the effects and specificity of various homeopathic drugs on prostate and breast cancer cells. They report significant inhibition of cancer growth with one drug (Sabal serrulata) in prostate but not breast cancer cells. They found cell type specificity for this drug, even at ultra-low dilutions. Note that they also found different effects when the drugs were made in glass versus plastic, indicating that the silicates and other contaminates from the container may contribute to the observed effects. (16) This idea is also discussed in the point-counterpoint discussion in this issue. These studies collectively illustrate that despite being excellent research by experienced investigators from various laboratories, the results are mixed and the direction of future research to determine clinical relevance is unclear. Again, the question is whether these traditional top of the hierarchy approaches to research on a CAM system can enlighten clinical decision making on questions of placebo or clinical effectiveness. We have asked 2 senior investigators to comment on these strategies and this research so far. A. R. Khuda-Bukhsh is from the University of Kalyani, India, and one of the most prominent researchers investigating homeopathy in India. He argues that the research currently extant in homeopathy is more than sufficient to demonstrate that conventional scientific methods can be used effectively to clarify the nature of this system of medicine and guide clinical practice. He calls for more research by knowledgeable investigators. Moffett, Arun, and Nambodiri, from the Uniformed Services University, debate the merits of this research in their point-counterpoint. They argue that basic science cannot advance our understanding of homeopathic research because the ultra-high dilutions used in homeopathy have no rational basis and so cannot form a scientific foundation for this area. Instead, they recommend that social and psychological studies be undertaken to explain what they feel are surely placebo effects. A full reading of each point and counterpoint exchange is well worth the time and provides an excellent summary of the issues under question. Finally, the Tumor Board in this issue highlights different \"whole systems\" approaches to a patient with breast cancer. This includes a comprehensive conventional medicine approach, a Chinese medicine approach from a physician who is also trained in Western medicine, and 2 different perspectives on the homeopathic management of the patient--one from a Western-trained physician who uses homeopathy and one from a physician in India who uses homeopathy for treatment of cancer. Visits to the Block Center for Integrative Cancer Treatment were made by the traditional Chinese medicine physician and the Western-trained homeopathic physician to assess the patient, an experience on the part of the clinic staff and patient alike that was of considerable interest; the assessment for the physician in India was done through an electronically transmitted questionnaire. The summaries and recommendations show the diversity of approaches used both between and within defined medical systems. This diversity is, in our opinion, even more reason why whole clinical systems need greater understanding, and why whole systems approaches to research need full development. Approaches that describe, detail, and objectively measure actual integrative practices and their effects should be done before simplifying those practices into treatments that can be conducted in randomized, placebo-controlled trials. We hope readers will find the information in this theme issue both thought provoking and valuable in making clinical judgments about the evaluation of evidence for complex and integrative approaches to healing and cancer care.
