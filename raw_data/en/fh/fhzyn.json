It's only natural for us to seek it out. Just as white blood cells flood to a wound to heal it and a tree releases sap to protect and cover damage and breakage, all of life is oriented to self-nourishment and repair. We are multi-layered beings living in a complex universe. Without actively taking care of our bodies, hearts, minds, and souls, we become sick. Perhaps one of the simplest and easiest ways we can call on the healing force within and around us is through meditation. By stilling the mind (which is the single biggest source of dis-ease), we make space for new energy, new life, and new growth. Will you come and flourish with me? Let's explore together how we can soothe all layers of our being!

Meditation doesn't have to be something tricky or intimidating. It's as simple as closing your eyes and listening to the sounds around you. Many people prefer to just connect with the breath ( [breathwork](https://lonerwolf.com/breathwork/)). Others favor moving meditation like tai chi, yoga, or dance. There are many flavors of meditation - and what suits us in one stage of life might not suit us in the next. Choose what you resonate with, and that's it! So to begin, just close your eyes (if that feels safe). Whatever helps you to stay in the present moment - and not in the mind - is, by nature, a form of meditation. Doing your teeth can be a meditation, driving can be a meditation, drinking your tea or coffee can be meditation, walking the dog can be meditation. Find the simple beauty in what you're doing, in the present moment, and you'll be meditating effortlessly! Healing Meditation & Spiritual Awakening There's a multicolored smorgasbord of healing meditations out there that cater to nearly every wound, trauma, or issue known to humanity. Incorporating at least one type of healing meditation into your daily routine can quickly become a crucial part of your [spiritual awakening](https://lonerwolf.com/spiritual-awakening/) journey. (At the moment I'm favoring [meditation mantras](https://lonerwolf.com/meditation-mantras/).) We exercise to stay fit and eat vegetables to stay healthy. Why not honor our spiritual well-being too? Let's stop ignoring the need's of the Soul - meditation is just as crucial as any other practice that maintains basic health! Healing Meditation: 21 Ways to Soothe Your Mind & Body We'll divide this section into four parts: healing meditations for the body, heart, mind, and Soul. Contemplate what type of healing you need the most right now - then go to the corresponding section. Alternatively, for holistic [spiritual healing](https://lonerwolf.com/spiritual-healing/), read through all sections. Notice which healing meditations stick out the most to you. Whatever catches your eye or triggers emotions or sensations within you is the meditation your Soul most resonates with! While some of these healing meditations are self-guided, others are hand-picked from YouTube. Do you want to incorporate a regular healing meditation practice into your life? Pay special attention to the self-directed meditations that I've written. If, on the other hand, you just want some quick relief, try the pre-recorded healing meditation tracks.
