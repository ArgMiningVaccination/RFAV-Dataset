Can I still get a flu shot? Ask the doctors Q. Is it true that I should skip my annual flu shot if I'm allergic to eggs? If not, is it too late in the season to get one? A. In the past, people with egg allergies were advised not to get the flu vaccine, but that advice no longer holds true. Most flu vaccines contain small amounts of egg proteins, which are introduced during the vaccine-manufacturing process. However, the CDC now advises that even people with egg allergies should receive the flu vaccine, because the risk of a severe allergic reaction is so small \u2014 only an estimated 1.31 vaccinations in every million. However, while those who experience more severe symptoms from egg, including swelling of the skin, breathing issues, lightheadedness, or vomiting, can get the standard flu shot, they are advised to have it administered only by a health care provider who can manage a severe allergic reaction in the unlikely event that one occurs. You can also ask for one of two egg-free flu formulations. If you have not yet gotten your flu shot this year, it's not too late to get one, and it is recommended that you do. \u2014 Toni Golen, M.D., and Hope Ricciotti, M.D. Editors in Chief, Harvard Women's Health Watch Image: \u00a9 Melissa Battiste/Getty Images Disclaimer: As a service to our readers, Harvard Health Publishing provides access to our library of archived content.
