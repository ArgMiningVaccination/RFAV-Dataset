Homeopathy is based on the philosophy that the body has a natural instinct for self-repair. Homeopathy is gentle, non-toxic and does not have any side-effects. It can be used for a wide range of conditions and is suitable for everyone of any age, including newborns, the elderly, pregnant and breast feeding mothers. Homeopaths look at the \"whole person\" as well as their symptoms to come to a diagnosis. Homeopaths take a very holistic view to their care. Simone's story - how she became a homeopath. I trained as an Occupational therapist and have been involved in health for most of my working life. Initially working with children with learning disabilities and then working in mental health. I have always been interested in healthy living and natural medicine and have always tended to search for solutions when conventional medicine did not have the answers for health issues for me and my family. I have always believed that illnesses should be cured and not palliated. I very rarely took conventional medicines always trying the natural alternatives first. My first introduction to homeopathy was one day when I fell hitting my face hard and a friend gave me an Arnica pill and I was amazed not to have any bruising the next day. I then discovered that Nat mur could stop a cold sore in its tracks. I decided to train as a homeopath. I was told that I would need to attend a homeopath as a condition of training. I felt that I was really healthy and the only thing I could think of was my allergic rhinitis (sneezing every morning and often all day) which I had had since childhood and my parents had tried many different treatments to no avail. After my first consultation with a homeopath the remedy I was given stopped my allergic rhinitis and nothing could make me sneeze. It has needed fine tuning since then but is no longer an issue for me. I found that when I had a bad mouth infection, which the dentist said I would have to let it heal on its own, I took Mercurius and the dentist was amazed and had to write the remedy down when I saw her a few days later. I badly burnt my hand one day holding the metal handle of a casserole that had just come out of the oven. I held my hand under hot water (as recommended in homeopathy college) and took the remedy Cantharis several times that evening. The next day the skin looked perfectly normal, no redness, blisters or peeling. After a shoulder replacement operation I used various homeopathic remedies and the surgeon was amazed at the speedy recovery and the way my bone had formed a bony callous over the place where the tendons had been attached, which apparently doesn't always happen. [back to top >>](#drychiro) What is the difference between homeopathic treatment and conventional medicine? In conventional medicine the medicine works by suppressing the symptoms. For instance if you have an allergy, you would be given antihistamines which would suppress the allergy but there may also be side effects such as dry mouth, drowsiness, dizziness. Or for eczema you could be given hydrocortisone which would work whilst the cream is applied but your eczema may return when you stop using the cream. There would also be side effects from the cream. With homeopathy we can give remedies to stop the immediate effects of the allergy which would not have any side effects, however we would look to treating your body so that your body can learn to cope with the allergen. Strangely the remedy for instant relief from the allergy would be the remedy Histamine (as opposed to anti-histamine), so here again we are provoking your body to respond even harder to the allergen, helping it to produce the symptoms to cure the problem. [back to top >>](#drychiro) How was homeopathy discovered? Homeopathy was discovered by a German doctor Samuel Hahnemann in 1796. He was a trained Doctor but was disillusioned by the medicine of the day which was crude and often did more harm than good. He stopped practising as a doctor and was once translating a medical paper on Quinine, the cure for Malaria. He could not understand why quinine, the bark of a tree, an astringent, could cure malaria. He tried some quinine himself and found that he developed all the symptoms of malaria. After a several hours he recovered. He was able to repeat the experiment with the same effects again. He then realised that any substance which produced symptoms in a healthy person, if taken in its natural form, could cure these same symptoms in sick person. He went on to test other substances like Arsenic and Belladonna (deadly nightshade). He continued to test out various substances. Now there are over 3,000 different remedies. [back to top >>](#drychiro) What happens in a homeopathic consultation? The first consultation will last 1\u00bd hours, shorter for a child. I am interested to hear what your diagnosis is but having a diagnosis is not essential. During the consultation I will ask you all about your symptoms in great detail, where the pains are, what they feel like, what makes them worse or better, do they appear in different parts of your body. Are they different at different times at the day or night, when are they worse or better. Depending on the symptoms there are many other questions. I am always interested in your description of how they feel in your own words for example it might feel like 'ants under the skin' or like a 'vice tightening' etc. I will ask you questions about your past history, any accidents, operations, unusual illnesses, treatments you have had. I will ask questions about your lifestyle, how you sleep, what positions, dreams, when you may wake in the night. I will ask about what types of foods and tastes you prefer or dislike, how much you drink. I will ask you questions to try and assess what your personality type is and your reactions to different situations. After the consultation I will have to spend some time considering your responses. I will then send you your remedy with instructions of how to take it. [back to top >>](#drychiro) What happens next?The remedy will start to work, initially there may be an aggravation. For example if you have a rash it might get slightly worse, this is a good sign, then it will start to improve. The healing may continue to work for weeks. Depending on the condition I will decide when to see you again, often 4 weeks after. If it is an acute problem, for instance morning sickness, I am happy to see you or even phone you sooner. When I see you in 4 weeks time I will go over your symptoms and see what changes have happened, if any new symptoms have appeared to replace the original symptoms, how you feel, how your energy is. I will then make a decision to: Either not give a remedy, as it may appear that the original remedy is still working; I may decide to give the remedy again; I might decide to give a different dose of the remedy or I may decide to give a different remedy. If after the first remedy you are better there will be no need to have a follow up unless you wish to. [back to top >>](#drychiro) How do you decide on the remedy? After taking your case, I will analyse it and pick out the most important points, these are usually the more specific points, there would be no point using the symptom of headache as there could be hundreds of remedies for general headache and I would not know which to prescribe, but if, for example, you describe a headache beginning in one part of your head and moving to another and feeling of heat combined with nausea, and also you are perhaps a very sensitive individual who dislikes one particular food and is always thirsty, then I could narrow the choice down the one particular remedy which would match you and your illness. I do this with the help of a repertory book which has lists of all possible symptoms in conjunction with a computer programme and many other reference books if required. [back to top >>](#drychiro) Why does it matter what foods I like and my personality? When the remedies are proved it has been found that different remedies are more effective for different personalities, different food preferences and basically all the other attributes that I ask about. In homeopathy we do not have a pill for each disease as in conventional medicine, although we do have some very specific remedies for instance Arnica for bruises. We are aware that different people suffer their illnesses in different ways. An example is, for instance, if every member of the family suffered from flu, they would probably all express it in a different way. One may retire to bed and not eat or drink. One may want to be covered. One may want to be uncovered and fanned, maybe one would want to sit in the lounge wrapped in a duvet and gain as much sympathy as possible. All will require a different remedy in homeopathy. In conventional medicine they may all be given the same medicine. This is the reason why a homeopathic remedy prescribed for you may not help a friend suffering from what appears to be exactly the same illness. [back to top >>](#drychiro) What are the remedies made from? Remedies are from the plant, mineral and animal kingdom, the majority are from the plant world. The example we all know is Arnica from the plant world, an example from the mineral world is sulphur and an example from the animal world is cat hair (used for allergies to cats). Remedies can be made from any substance, so if, for instance, someone was suffering side effects from a conventional medicine, then this can be made up into a homeopathic remedy and taken to counteract the side effects. [back to top >>](#drychiro) Why does homeopathy give remedies to mirror symptoms? Homeopaths regard the body as having an intelligence and symptoms are the body's way of fighting the illness / infection etc. If you eat bad food the body will try to expel it; if you hurt yourself the body may try to immobilise the part; if there are noxious substances in your body, your body may produce a rash to try and expel them; in a fever your body heats to burn off the infection. Giving homeopathic remedies will give the extra support to your body to do what it needs to do. It is so natural and obviously correct. If you were to continue taking the homeopathic remedies when the condition has been treated, then you may start to suffer the symptoms of that remedy, although stopping the remedy will stop the symptoms. One of the problems with conventional medicines and with suppressing symptoms (also done by using over-the-counter medication) is that the body has already chosen the safest way to eliminate the problem, if this is thwarted by applying suppressing creams to eczema, the body will have to look for an alternative way which may not be so safe. If this was eczema it could appear cured but re-emerge as asthma which is more dangerous and unpleasant than eczema. [back to top >>](#drychiro) Can you still be treated by your GP and take medicines if you have homeopathy? Very definitely yes. Homeopathy can be used alongside conventional medicine. The aim would be to work with you until your GP agreed that your illness had improved and he may consider reducing your medication. I have had clients who hope to avoid going to their GP or taking conventional medicines when having homeopathy. I strongly recommend that they attend the GP for a diagnosis and also inform the GP and seek his permission if they are insisting on stopping any medication. It can be extremely dangerous to stop certain essential medicines and if they are to be stopped it has to be in a carefully supervised way by the GP. Homeopathy cannot interfere with the action of medications, it can help to reduce the side effects of essential conventional medicines. Homeopathy is often used to treat the side effects of chemotherapy. [back to top >>](#drychiro) Tell me about the recovery after homeopathy? After taking a homeopathic remedy the body will often recover in a set way. It will recover from the inside outwards, from the top downwards and from the more important organs to the less important organs. Occasionally it may make your body revert to previous symptoms during the process of recovery. Examples are: You may have a pain or a rash on your shoulders but it may move to further down your arms or to your legs; If you have a lung complaint you might find it replaced by a skin complaint; If you have headaches but used to have nausea, you might find that the headaches go but your nausea returns. These are all good signs that the remedy is working and the body will continue to heal completely. [back to top >>](#drychiro) Tell me about the fertility treatment? Fertility treatment is very relevant these days as 25% of women have difficulty conceiving. This is partly due to having been on the pill for many years and also leaving having a family till later in life. I have studied the Liz Lalor fertility programme. She has 87% success over a 4 months period in women up to the age of 42, after that her rate of success is 2%. By July 2015 she claimed responsibility for 340 babies. This is really exciting.

In France, 40% of the population uses homeopathic medicines and around 30% of physicians prescribe them. Homeopathy is also very popular in the UK. England's Royal Family are vocal advocates of homeopathy. Sales of homeopathic medicines in Germany were approximately $428 million in 1991, growing at a rate of about 10 percent per year. Evidence of the significant support from the German medical community is the fact that 85% of these sales are prescriptions from physicians. Surveys indicate that 98% of pharmacies sell homeopathic medicines. Other European countries in which homeopathy has a relatively strong presence include Switzerland, where different surveys have suggested that somewhere between 11% and 27% of general practitioners and internists prescribe homeopathic medicines; Italy where 9% of the medical doctors prescribe homeopathic remedies sometimes; and the Netherlands where 45% of physicians consider homeopathic medicines effective and 47% of medical doctors use one or more complementary therapies, with homeopathy. Homeopathy is the most popular in Asian countries especially India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Homeopathy received the moral support from Mahatma Gandhi. Who said, \"it cures a greater number of people than any other method of treatment\" In India over 100 million people depend solely on homeopathic medicine. Further, according to an A.C. Neilsen survey in India, 62% of current homeopathy users have never tried conventional medicines and 82% of homeopathy users would not switch to conventional treatments. There are hundreds of State and Central government owned homeopathic hospitals in India having inpatient facilities. Homeopathy also has a strong following in Russia, Mexico and South America, particularly in Brazil and Argentina. [back to top >>](#drychiro) What is the training for homeopathy? I trained at the South Downs school of homeopathy. The homeopathy professional 4 year training course consists of 30 weekends each academic year - from September to June inclusive. In addition, there is a considerable degree of directed, home based study (about 12-15 hours a week) in the form of reading, research and written assignments, 100 hours of sitting in homeopathic clinics, and (in the final year) a project. To remain a member of the Society of Homeopaths, I have to provide evidence of my continuing professional development. [back to top >>](#drychiro) Testimonials from find a homeopath website.
