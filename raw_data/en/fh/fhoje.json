In Thomas Jefferson's words, agriculture is the \"first and most precious of all the arts.\" Lt. Governor Brown, Agriculture Secretary Buddy Hance and I have traveled the Statemeeting with farmers and watermen to find the best ways to protect farming jobs and keep family farming profitable, preserve contiguous tracts of farmland, and grow smarter as a State. As we look forward to the future, we hope to build uponthe progress we have already made to strengthen Maryland's agricultural economy. We have already made great strides in supporting our farmers and watermen. T ogether, we have encouraged Marylanders to Buy Local, provided cost-share funding forcover crops, permanently preserved over 30,000 acres of farmland, protected our livestock and poultry industries from unfair federal regulations, and created a new shellfish aquaculture initiative to both help struggling watermen and our waterquality. These accomplishments and many others help to protect the health of our economy, our families and communities, our environment, and our food supply. The theme of Moving Maryland Forward frames this Administration's decisio ns on our shared priorities. Marylanders will see a continued focus on innovation for a new economy and job creation as we move into the New Y ear. Agriculture is an important part of these initiatives asfarmers diversify their businesses and use new technologies for on-farm conservation among other efforts to strengthen rural communities and keep farmland open and productive. As just oneexample of agricultural employment results, since its founding in2007, the Maryland Agricultural and Resource Based IndustriesDevelopment Corporation (MARBIDCO) has created 256 jobs and retained 287 jobs in Maryland through its entrepreneurial grants and loans programs. By continuing our work together, we will move Maryland forward through this national economic downturn andemerge very strongly with innovative new industries and jobs. In the f ederal government, we have worked very closely with United States Secretary of Agriculture T om Vilsack, who has been very acces- sible to us, to support our livestock and poultry industries and secure federal dollars for soil conservation districts, a new Eastern Shore Animal Health facility, and cover crops. As we work through the Chesapeake Bay restoration process, I will remain in contact with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lisa Jackson to make sure that Maryland farmers arenot placed at a competitive disadvantage to other states. I want to thank each Marylander from every rural and agricultural sector who has met with us to share their views. We look forward to maintaining our open and honest dialog to advance our shared priorities of protecting and strengthening our middle class, including our family-owned businessesand far ms. Sincerely, Martin O'Malley Governor| Message from Governor Martin O'Malley | Governor O'Malley meets with poultr y farmers to hear their concer ns and to shar e his support for the industry.4Dear Friends, Much of our attention at MDA over the past year has been on the State budget. While extremely challenging, Maryland is in a much better position than many states. Despite this,we've had to reduce programs, services and staffing where we didn't think there was room to cut back further. As difficult as these times are, as a farmer, I am an optimist. I do believe things will work out, and that we will emerge from the national economic downturn in a strong position tocapitalize on new jobs and innovative business opportunities for our employees and for the businessesand citizens we serve. At MDA, some of the efforts to become more efficient with our operating expenses and public programs and services include: VConsolidating five regional animal health diagnostic laboratories down to two (Frederick and Salisbury). VBoosting participation in the cover crop program by providing partial payment to farmers and making other farmer-requested changes. VPutting in pla ce the ne w Conservation Tracker to help account for and give credit to farmers for all conservation best management practices, not just those using government cost share. VLaunching an innovative remote sensing program through federal funds to certify cover crop fall planting and performance via satellite rather than sending field staff out to inspect each field. VProviding tw o electronic options for farmers to submit their Nutrient Management Annual Imple mentation Reports (AIR) showing how they fulfilled their nutrient management plans each year. VUsing GPS technology to make Weights and Measures inspections more geographically efficient. In addition, the program is assigning inspections from headquarters to automate reports and makethe results more statistically valid. VStarting a centralized collection of fee and license payments through a lockbox system to make more efficient the handling of the State's cash resources. VImplementing an energy efficiency performance contract at MDA headquarters office that will save more than $4.36 million over 14 years and reduce significantly its environmental footprint. Additionally, the agency has installed three rain gardens and increased recycling dramatically. VImproving online services to consumers, making the web a first point of contact for program information. In addition, Maryland's Best provides a centralized location for consumers to findlocal products. Soon, farmers will be able to post their product availability directly to the web, again boosting services. VDeveloping with federal funds a program to provide electronically the location of sensitive (such as wine grapes) and organic crops so that pesticide applicators can avoid spraying them. During this fiscal year, the Maryland Office of the National Agricultural Statistics Service released its snapshot o fagricult ure in 2009. It details some interesting farm information. Did you know that farm receipts declined more than $200 million from 2008 to 2009? Farmers are feeling the pinch like everyone else. MDA, together with farmers, is working hard to help reverse this trend and regainstronger profitability. This is especially important in a difficult economy.| Message from Secretary Earl F. Hance |5| Message from Secretary Earl F. Hance | New initiatives to help farmers prepare for success when the economy turns around include: VConvening, with industry leaders, in 2010 the Governor's AgriculturalForum which resulted in a Statewide Plan for Agriculture to chart a course for the industry over the next 15 years. VDeveloping, through the Governor's Intergovernmental Commission forAgriculture, a tool kit to help localcommunities and officials understand the current state of agriculture, to find solutions to challenges, and to expandopportunity for the sector. Resourcesrange from labor, environment and farmland preservation to energy, wildlife management and food security. VWorking with the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene and the University of Maryland to make possible licensing of farmers for on-farm processing of fruits, vegetables, poultry and rabbits so that farmers have greater access to markets and consumers to a broader array of local products. VRevamping ancient aquaculture leasing rules and creating aquaculture development financing programs to encourage revitalization of this industry, which will help restore the Chesapeake Bay. VExpanding alternative energy opportunities for agriculture. VModernizing wine laws to allow for market expansion. VCreating a new nutrient trading tool so that farmers can sell nutrient reduction credits that exceed a benchmark level. Final ly, the federal U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's T otal Maximum Daily Load (TMDL)/ Watershed Implementation Plan (WIP) process is well underway. Some of the elements in the WIPwill require farmers to do things differently and we are working hard to make sure that the technical and financial assistance is there to help farmers meet the targets. If science shows that farmers can apply fewer nutrients and still meet the crop needs then input costs will be lower and profits potentially greater. Y ou can read more about most of these initiatives inside this report. I know that when we pull together,MDA, Maryland farmers, and the citizens and businesses we serve will be positioned to move Maryland forward. It is a new page in agriculture's long and successful story. Best Regards, Earl F. Hance Secretary Maryland D epartment of Agriculture The Maryland Agricultural Commission The Maryland Agricultural Commission is the advisory group to the Maryland Secretary of Agriculture. There are 30 members on the commission with representation from each of the State's major commodity groups: poultry,dairy, equine, nursery, etc. as well as representatives from the University of Maryland, consumer interests, food processing and various other agricultural business segments. The commission holds monthly meetings and discusses issues of agricultural consequence. This year the commission hadnotable speakers and subsequent in-depth discussions on thesubjects of: the equine industry, the dairy crisis, MDA Animal Health diagnostic laboratories, forest certification and chain of custody, and the results of the forestry summit, the Chesapeake Bay model, the new Conservation Tracker, the livestock industry, Maryland Greenhouse Gas Reductions Act of 2009, viticulture in Maryland, rural jobs development, changes to the nutrient management plan, and the TMDL(T otal Maximum Daily Load) process. These topics along with reports from each of the commodity and b usiness g roups r epresented on the commission keep the g roup proactive with agricultural issues and assure the fulfillment of the commission's statutory mission. In addition, the c ommissio n he ld its b i-ann ual far m tours in Somerset and Worcester counties in the fall and Baltimore and Carroll counties in the spring. The commission continues to develop priorities and works actively on the implementation of the Statewide Plan for Agriculture and Resource Management. In addition the commission sponsored and members attended the Governor's Agriculture Forum in February to develop a new 15-year plan for Maryland agriculture.Office of the Attorney General Staff of the Office of the Attorney General (OAG) represents the department on behalf of the State Office of theAttorney General and provides legal representation and advice. The office routinely provides legal assistance to theboards and units within the department, reviews regulationsand legislation proposed by various units within the departmentfor legal sufficiency, and assists in producing educational programs for departmental staff. In 2010, the office: VWorked with the OAG's Civil Division for the second time to defend competing claims against MDA filed by theMaryland Farm Bureau and the Waterkeepers, seeking disclosure of nutrient management records under the Public Information Act. VProvided legal services to and supported increased enforce- ment ofthe M aryland Agricultural Land Preservation Foundat ion (MALPF). To date, this program, which now holds more than 2,100 easements state-wide has preserved 283,000 acres of farm land. Also successfully defended an action brought in Harford County that challenged thestatus of an agricultural land preservation easement. VSupported increased enforcement of the State's Nutrient Manag ement La w. VSuccessful ly defended an important case under the agricultural land preservation program in the Court of Special Appeals where the Court affirmed the MALPF position that a farm under the F oundat ion's easement may not be subdivided without Foundation approval. VSuccessfully persuaded the I.R.S. to dismiss claims against two Maryland farmers in the U.S. Tax Court over the perpetual status of a state farmland preservation easement. VAssisted the State Board of Veterinary Medical Examiners in licensing and disciplinary matters. 6| Office of the Secretary | The Maryland Agricultural Commission visits Lambco, Inc., a specialty meat processing facility in Carroll County, to learn about this growing segment of the livestock industry.The Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Foundation (MALPF) was created by the Maryland GeneralAssembly in 1977 to preserve productive agricultural and forested land that provides for the continued production of food and fiber for the present and future citizens of thestate. Preservation of agricultural and forested land helps to curb the expansion of random urban development, protect wildlife and preserve the environmental quality of theChesapeake Bay and its tributaries. If a landowner's property meets the minimum eligibility criteria for soils, size, and location as established in statute, the landowner may apply to sell an agricultural land preservationeasement to MALPF. An easement restricts the land to agricul- tural use in perpetuity, limits in perpetuity the ability of the land t o be subdivided or developed for residential, commercial, or industrial use, and requires good stewardship practices. Because the f oundat ion combined FY 2009 and FY 2010 funds into one easement acquisition offer cycle in FY 2009, the only new offers made during FY 2010 were those using new localfunds or state funds recycled from previously rejected offers. Four new offers were made during FY 2010 to preserve an additional 304 acres. After all acreage adjustments and with-drawn or rejected offers from the FY 2009/10 acquisition cycle ha ve been taken into consideration, MALPF now has purchased or has pending offers to purchase easements on a cum ulative total o f2,080 p roperties, permanently preserving approximately 283,500 acres. Using primarily local funds from Montgomery and St. Mary's counties and state funds from earlier rejections, MALPF committed $2.8 million to these four offers ($1.8 million in new funds). The Ge neral Assembly adopted new legislation affecting MALPF during the 2010 legislative session. The most important change for the future of the program was to create a new\"partnership\" program by explicitly authorizing the acquisition ofagricult ural preservation easements in partnership with outside pub lic and private entities using ranking criteria, valuation methods, and easement provisions differing from those used in the regular program. No state funds would beused for the direct acquisition costs. MALPF has identifiedentities with complementary and, sometimes supplemental goals to those pursued by MALPF that may provide funding possibilities for future workable partnerships in acquiringpreservation easements otherwise not available. Senate Bill 59 r emoved the annual dedication of $4 million of MALPF funds from the agricultural transfer tax (and real estat e transfer tax when agricultural transfer tax revenues are inadequate) to interest payment obligations undertaken as part of a \"leveraged\" installment purchase agreement (IPA) program. MALPF was advised by the Treasurer's Office and the Office of the Attorney General that leveraged IPAs are unconstitutional because tax revenues cannot be dedicated to serve debt beyond 15 years. If landowners choose the IPA payments option,| Office of the Secretary | The Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Foundation 7VGoal: The p reservation of adequate amounts of farmland, woodland and open space in Maryland to ensure the continued production of food and fiber and to protect the agribusiness infrastructure for the future. VObjective: By the year 2022, preserve 1,030,000 acres of farmland, woodland and open space land in Maryland through the purchase of permanent easements, local government land preservation programs, local Transfer of DevelopmentRights ( TDRs), and similar programs (SJ10-2002). Performance Measures 2010 Actual Output: T otal number of easements, cumulative 2,010 Outcome: T otal acres under easements 283,661 8| Office of the Secretary | MALPF can fund it from its standard allocation of funds by investing the funds necessary at settlement to cover the payment of interest and principal. New certification requirements from the Agricultural Stewardship Act of 2006 and House Bill 1354 (2007) went into effect on July 1, 2008. Regulations were developed to implement the statutory changes and became effective January 26, 2009. As of July 1, 2010, all county certification programshad been reviewed under the changed requirements and brought into compliance with the certification regulations. Cumulative reviews over the last two fiscal years resulted innine c ount ies b eing ful ly recertified (Anne Arundel, Baltimore, Calvert, Cecil, Frederick, Kent, Montgomery, St. Mary's, and Worcester counties) as of June 30, 2010. Six counties are conditionally recertified (Carroll, Charles, Harford, Queen Anne's, Talbot, and Washington counties), one county received its first full certification (Caroline County), and one countywas denied recertification (Wicomico County). At the end of FY 2010, 16 of Maryland's 23 counties have certified local agricultural land preservation programs. MALPF also par tners with other state agencies and local governments to meet a legislative goal (SJ 10, 2002) of preserving1,030,000 a cres of agricultural land by 2022. As of January 1, 2010, Maryland has preserved approximately 550,000 acres of agricultural land under MALPF, Rural Legacy, GreenPrint, andthrough local land preservation and transfer of development rights programs. The Public Information and Outreach offices reach out to the media, general public, government agency peers,elected officials, the agriculture industry, and to MDA employees with the intent of strengthening the appreciation and understanding of the importance of agriculture and MDAactivities to the everyday lives of Marylanders and to support policy initiatives. A Schaefer Center Survey states that the public has an increasingly positive view of many of theagency's priority activities\u2014farmland preservation, purchase of local products and environmental stewardship by farmers\u2014 an indicator that public relations efforts at MDA may be hav-ing an impact over the long term. The most prominent events produced by the Public Information and Outreach offices in 2010 were the Buy- Local Cookout at the Governor's official residence in July to kick off Buy Local Challenge Week, the agency's \"exhibits\" at the M aryland Stat e Fair in August, and the Farm-to-School launch in September. These events showcase the agency to thousands of people and require the involvement of dozens ifnot hundreds of employees. The office represented MDA at anumber of events such as the Maryland Municipal League,Maryland Association of Counties, and the Maryland FarmBureau conventions. During FY2010, staff distributed 256 news releases to approximately 315 news outlets and interested parties routinely, which generated ap proximately 844 logged calls from the media. The office uses a media monitoring system to track and research media contacts, to distribute news releases, maintain media lists for targeted stories, and to find news clippings of interest to the agency and its constituencies. Each day, news stories are clipped, linked to the agency's website and distrib- uted to all staff and other interested parties. During the year, the Public Information Office increased the agency's presence on the Internet, making it the first point of agency contact for more and more people. There were approximately 422,207 visits of which 65 percent were new visitors during the year. The visitors viewed nearly 869,517 pages. The activity increased steadily through the year. The leading pag e views after the homepage were farmers' markets, jobs,licenses and permits and the daily news clippings. Without a designated agency web master, a team representing the Information T echnology and Public Information officesand the Plant Protection and Weed Management Section keeps the site up-to-date and determines ways to improve it. 9| Office of the Secretary | Public Information and Outreach Offices The Office of Administrative Services manages all technical and support services for the department. It is comprised of four sections\u2014Human Resources, Central Services, Fiscal Services, and Emergency Management. The department has approximately 500 permanent and seasonal employees and Human Resource facilitates therecruitment, training, appropriate compensation, and reten- tion of qualified individuals. Additionally, the office assists with the transition of those employees leaving governmentservice. Programs and services for employees include risk management, employee leave bank, teleworking, wellness, blood drives, and training as well as employee recognition. Central Services staff manage facilities, records, inventory, telecommunications, warehousing, the agency motor fleet andthe distribution of supplies and mail. The office also overseesdepartmental procurement and is responsible for the mainte- nanc e and repair of 331,600 square feet of facilities on 40.5 acres of owned and leased facilities throughout the state. The maint enanc e staff imple ment energy-saving projects wherever possib le.A recycling program uses compost piles to transform organic waste into mulch, which is utilized in landscaping projects at MDA. The motor pool provides quality mainte-nance and repairs of the department's 274 vehicles in additionto semi-annual inspections on all vehicles. The MDA fleettraveled more than 2.5 million miles last year. Fiscal S ervices staff members handle all centralized accounting transactions for MDA. This encompasses all phases of the budget, grants management, accounts receivable, accountspayable and leave management. The office has continued itsfine record of paying over 99 percent of MDA bills on time as defined by state on-time guidelines. Emergency Management for MDA addresses any and all emergencies within MDA. The department is in the process of completing a new management plan that will be tailored to MDA and in concert with the statewide emergency operations plan. Additionally, the department continues toprovide annual training and drills for first responders.The Office of Administrative ServicesIn the spirit of the Administration's efforts to provide transparency in government, the public information staffmaintain an online regulatory action center to publicize thedepartment's enforcement actions. The goal is to give the publica better understanding of how MDA protects consumers,businesses and the environment on a daily basis. It is also intended to be a deterrent of future violations of the law by theregulated agricultural community. Planning for emergency communications in the event of plant and animal disease outbreaks is an important component of the program. The Public Information Office was activelyinvolved in multi-agency efforts (Delmarva Poultry Industries\u2014Health Departments Joint Task Force) to refine response and communications plans in the event of avian influenza outbreak on the Delmarva Peninsula. Staff rep- resent the agency on the Heritage Areas T echnical Advisory Committee and the newly formed Maryland Agricultural Education Council. In addition, staff are actively involved inthe C ommunicat ions Offic ers of State Departments of Agriculture, the national Emerald Ash Borer public information working group and the state Smart, Green and G rowing Communications Committee. 10| Office of the Secretary | Some of the biggest news stories handled by the Public Information office in 2010 were the drought, the devastatingimpacts of the February snow storms, environmental regulatoryissues like the EPA T otal Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) planningfor agriculture, Concentrated Animal Feeding Operation permit process, local impact of national food safety issues, and the promotion of Maryland made, grown, and harvestedproducts. Other high-profile media inquiries included the new Maryland and federal animal feeding operation permit being required of poultry and livestock producers; and the strongenvironmental accomplishments or impacts of agriculture, the state budget affect on MDA, farmers and other users of the agency's programs and services, and consumer complaints related to the high price of gas and the amount of fuel dispensed. Exciting initiatives that the public information staff led in collaboration with other MDA offices, the University ofMaryland, state and local agencies and related non-profit organizations, were the Grow it-Eat it Backyard FoodGardening campaig n and MD A's involvement in the O'Malley/ Brown Administration's Capital for a Day community relations events. VSB 82 \u2014clarifies definitions in Maryland's Commercial Feed Law to be more consistent with the broadly-endorsedAmerican Association of Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) Model Bill and Regulations. VSB 90 \u2014provides the Secretary of Agriculture with the authority to quarantine farmland and agricultural productsand stop-sale on-farm agricultural products that have been contaminated by a chemical or radiological material or agent after consultation with the Governor and theSecretaries of Health and Mental Hygiene and the Environment. VSB 95 \u2014gives the Board of Trustees of the Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Foundation explicit authority to acquire preservation easements on farmland in par tnership w ith ou tside public and private entities. MDA also put forward another bill, SB 94, a bill to increase funding for the MDA Weights and Measures Program; however,this b ill was not v oted on in Committee. MDA has also spent a lot of time working with the Maryland Congressional Delegation to provide input into several high profile pieces oflegislation, including the Food Safety and Modernization Act,Child Nutrition Reauthorization and the Agricultural Appropriations bills. Language included in the food safety legislation will enable MD A to qualify for funding to replace its aging poultry lab, as well as provide exemptions for some small farmers from the federal law.The department's Government Relations liaison works with elected officials to ensure that agriculture's interests are understood and best represented in laws, regulations and policies. During the 2010 General Assembly Session, MDA put forward 11 departmental bills, of which 10 were signed into law. VSB 59 \u2014alters MALPF funding methods and adds flexibility to the acquisition of easements using a settlement option the landowner prefers through a partnership with MARBIDCO. VSB 93 \u2014alters and increases the fee structure for pesticide applicator certification examinations, registration of pest control employees with MDA and late fee payments for license, certificate or registration renewal under the Pesticide Applicator's law. VHB 420 \u2014expands the a ctivities and ways that the MDA Mosquito Control program can work in order to make it a more effective and efficient program. VHB 421 \u2014authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to adopt standar ds to regulate the use of the terms \"locally grown\" and \"local\" to advertise or identify an agricultural product\u2014including seafood\u2014and prohibits a person fromknowingly advertising or identifying an agricultural product in violation of standards. VHB 974 \u2014authorizes MDA to implement a nutrient credit trading program and facilitating transactionsbetween participating parties. VSB 62 \u2014directs revenue collected for licensing and inspecting ho rse stables to the Maryland Horse Industry Fund to help promote and protect the industry. It also increases the f ees for licensing and inspecting horse stables from $75 to $125 to cover the cost of the administration ofthe p rogram. VSB 81 \u2014gives the State Board of Veterinary Medical Examiners the authority to increase the civil penalty for a licensee from $5,000 to $10,000 for any violation of Boardlaws or regulat ions in addition to suspension or revocation of a license. 11| Office of the Secretary | Government Relations12Approximately 18 percent of Maryland organic sales were direct to consumers, via farms stands, farmers' markets,Community Supported Agriculture (CSAs) and other arrange- ments compared to the national average of seven percent. Maryland farmers reported using a variety of conservationand environmental practices on their organic certified and exempt farms in 2008. Among the most popular were the use of green or animal manure and the planting and maintenanceof buffer strips. In December 2010, NASS released the results of the 2009 Census of Horticultural Specialties. The report provides the only comprehensive, detailed picture of Maryland's floriculture,nursery and specialty crops production. It provides informa- tion on the number and types of establishments, value of sales, varieties of products, production expenses and more. Complete results of the 2008 Organic Production Survey and 2009 Census of Horticultural Specialties are available atwww.agcensus.usda.gov. T o obtain a copy of the Agriculture in Maryland 2009 Summary call 410-841-5740 or log on to www.nass.usda.gov/Statistics_by_State/Maryland.The Maryland Field Office of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) statistical agency, the NationalAgricultural Statistics Service (NASS), provides the public with data relating to the production of most crops grown and livestock raised in the state. Annual information is provided on the general economic well being of the state's agricultural sector. NASS statistics are used to administer and support USDA farm programs that benefit Maryland farmers,to determine the feasibility of new ventures affecting our state's farmers, and to direct program research and development. NASS has a rich history of collecting and distributing agricul- tural statistics, dating back over 140 years. Each year, theemployees of NASS conduct hundreds of surveys and prepare reports that impact every facet of Maryland's agricultural community. Our mission, to provide timely, accurate and useful statistics in service to U.S. agriculture, would not be possib le withou t the v oluntar y cooperation of Maryland farmers that take valuable time to respond to our surveys. In 2009\u2014the most recent year that annual statistics are available for this report\u2014agriculture generated nearly $1.66billion in cash receipts for the state's farmers, not accounting for the additional impact provided by related jobs and services.Maryland' s leading cash c ommodities were broiler chickens, greenhouse/nursery products, corn, soybeans and milk and dairy products. The Maryland Field Office of NASS estimated there were 12,800 far ms in 2009 w ith an a verage size of 160 acres. T otal land in farms in Maryland was 2.05 million acres, one-third of the state's entire land area. In February 2010, NASS published the results of the 2008 Organic P roduction Survey. This was the first-ever in-depth survey of organic farming in the United States and came in direct response to the growing interest in organics among consumers, farmers, businesses and others. The 2008 OrganicProduction Survey counted 129 organic farms during 2008. The 129 Maryland farms include USDA certified organic farms and farms that were exempt from certification. Maryland organic farms are smaller, on average, than all Maryland far ms.Organic far ms averaged 72 acres of land, compared to 160 acres for all farms. Maryland organic sales totaled $10.4 million, including $4.9 million in crop sales and$5.5 mil lion in sales o f livestock, poultry and their products. Thirty-five percent of these farms have been in organic agricultural production for less than 10 years.USDA/National Agricultural Statistics Service Each year, NASS publishes an invaluable summary of the previous year's agricultural surveys.| Office of the Secretary |Information T echnology Services (IT) is responsible for maintaining and upgrading all telecommunications anddata processing systems at the Maryland Department of Agriculture (MDA). MDA 's Networking, Application Development and T echnical Support sections have been effective and efficient in servicing the department's goals by ensuring employees are more productive to serve the public. The Networking Staff has continued their effort to upgrade our e-mail system to the latest software. MDA employees nowhave the ability to access their e-mail from anywhere on the web, as well as the capability to access their network files from areas outside of headquarters. Greenhouse and Motor pool were added to our existing net- work, ensuring connectivity back to the headquarters building for e-mail and file shar ing.Also, all Catalyst switches located at headquarters were upgraded to Cisco 3750 switches. Our Application Development Staff continues to provide licensing and r egistration data services to Maryland citizens as one of IT Services' top priorities. Many modifications have been implemented to gather, distribute and use data forlicensing and r egistration systems including data on inspection and r egulat ory services. T o offer these services over the web, numerous obstacles must be overcome. The first phase is to mak e Or acle web-base d services accessible to MDA employees. The second phase (public access) will require a complete re-design of these tools, with attention to the amount and typeof data accessed, as well as addressing the significantly larger issues asso ciated with facing any application to the Internet. T o continue the first phase of this project, IT's Application Development Staff will continue to learn and apply the programming techniques associated with web-based systems. IT Services Application Development Staff have implemented the use of a lockbox system for receiving payments for licensing and r egistration renewals. Payments are received directly by the bank for processing. Electronic transfer of most paymentdata from the bank to MDA 's databases reduces payment processing time and data entry errors ultimately reducing timeto iss ue renewals. Within a year, all registration and licensing systems will be processed through the lockbox.The T echnical Support staff has made significant strides this year by implementing and a new help desk tracking system.Open Ticket Resource System (OTRS) is a web based customer request system that allows staff to track and respond to employees issues in a timelier manner. When technical callsare entered into the system, an email is sent to the entire team making them aware that a service is required. This allows the team to be more effective in servicing our employees byallowing minimal downtime. One of T echnical Support's staff greatest tasks is to ensure that all desktops and laptops are kept current. Routine software updates and general troubleshooting of workstations accountfor a significant amount of staff time. Updates are important to ensure that workstations' and laptops' operating systems and so ftwar e are up to date. A yearly physical inventory is con- ducted at headquarters as well as all field offices. A complete updat e ofthe e mplo yee's system is performed at this time. IT staff continues to host, support and assists in the maintenance of MDA 's main website and Maryland's Best website. MDA 'swebsite was re-designed to conform to Maryland State's guide-lines. A new server has been configured and software has been installed and updated to accommodate the transformation.The w ebsite for Maryland's Best is currently being re-designed and w ill be available late spring 2011. New searchable features are available as well as the ability to display Y ouTube videos on farmers and the ir produce as w ell as detailed information about the farmer. Final ly,a new employee intranet website was introduced to help employees locate and view information faster in one central location. The goal of this portal is to allow employees to link t o relevant information at their convenience, rather than being distracted by electronic mail. Features such as training manuals and company policies and procedures can be utilized quickly and can substantially reduce queries and inquiries. 13Information Technology Services| Office of the Secretary |Marketing Services' primary role is to develop profitable marketing opportunities for Marylandfarmers. The division also serves as a conduit for federal resources and for policy information specific to the agricultural sector. In 2010, Marketing focused its efforts onbuilding demand for local farm products through promotions, advertising as well as through business development activities with grocery store chains, food processors, chefs and otherbuyers. The market for local products is increasing in the state, with more than 78 percent of Marylanders saying they would prefer to buy food grown in Maryland (University of BaltimoreSchaefer Center for Public Policy). Other key areas of activities include international marketing, with staff of the division facilitating meetings between Maryland food companies andfarmers and international buyers from Russia, Cuba, the UnitedArab Emirates, Jordan, Canada and the European Union. Buy Local Through a combination of press releases, paid advertising through public and commercial radio, online and print, and promotional events, Marketing developed demand f or local p roducts through- out 2010. Primarily funded through a $200,000 grant from the U.S.Department ofAgriculture designed to support the growth of the specialty crop industry, promotions encouraged consumers to buy Maryland grown fruits, vegetables, flowers, nursery products, wine and Christmas trees. Because of restrictions on federal funds, state funds were used to promote dairy, meat, poultry and the ag-tourism sectors. An estimated 800,000 Marylandersreceived promotional messages from MDA during the year. The Maryland's Best web site, www.marylandsbest.net, is the primary conduit for information for consumers seeking local farm stands, farmers markets and information aboutMaryland far ms.The web site includes contact information for farms, directions and video interviews with farmers about their far ming o perations. The web site, relaunched in 2007, has b een used more than 500,000 times. In a first for this state program, Maryland author Lucie Snodgrass donated $2,000 to Maryland's Best in 2010 as part of the proceeds from the salesof her book, \"Dishing Up Maryland\" which features Maryland farmers and recipes with local food.Governor Martin O'Malley supported the buy local program and Maryland's Best by kicking off the 2010 Buy LocalChallenge Week with the third annual cookout at his residence in July. This event included farmers, food writers, chefs, gro- cery store representatives and media, as the Governor encour-aged Marylanders to seek out Maryland-grown food. Media students at Loyola University in Baltimore City designed and published a book for Marketing in 2010 with recipes used atthe cookout. These 200 books were distributed to promote the Maryland products included in each entry. In its third year, the Jane Lawton Farm to School Program continued to drive increased consumption of locally grownproduce in Maryland public schools. Marketing works closely with the Maryland State Department of Education on the program. Each county school system has participated in buying locally and they make the program work within their budget.For example, in Harford County Public Schools (HCPS) the school system buys direct from seven farms, they have 38,000 students in 54 schools with 15 productionkitchens and serve nearly five million meals during the schoolyear. In the Maryland growing season, HCPS will purchase70-80 percent of their produce locally. This year, the programcreated a video contest among Maryland school children was held during September. Fifteen videos were submitted for the inaugural contest and they represented student's views on whyeating lo cal p roduce is important. Secretary Buddy Hance visited with the two Grand Prize winners\u2014three high school students in Carroll County and one middle school student inMontgomery County\u2014of the video contest at their schools. A key function of the Marketing division is its annual buyer- grower event. This opportunity for Maryland farmers to meet with buyers has grown from about 20 participants in 2004 toabout 300 in 2010. Throughout the year, Marketing staff link Maryland farmers with buyers from grocery store chains, restaurants and food service companies. This annual meetingis an o pportunity to bring together buyers and farmers face- to-face to develop business. Companies represented in 2010 included Wegmans, Whole Foods, Safeway, Giant and Fresh Market. Chefs attending the Annapolis meeting included John Shields of Baltimore's Gertrude's and Spike Gjerde of the Woodberry Kitchen in Baltimore, selected one of the nation'stop restaur ants in B on App\u00e9tit magazine. 14| Office of Marketing, Animal Industries and Consumer Services | Marketing Services With USDA Specialty Crop funds, Marketing also awarded $387,455 in grants to eight projects that will enhance the com-petitiveness of specialty crops in Maryland. Some of the proj- ects include: developing biodegradable sod production netting and roll wrap from keratin for Maryland's sod productionindustry, increasing specialty crop sales of fruits and vegetables to low-income populations in eight Maryland communities, creating four new public events in 2011 featuring Marylandwine and specialty crops and creating a food safety program.Farmers Markets The Farmers Market Nutrition Program (FMNP) works with farmers markets in all 23 Maryland counties and Baltimore City. MDA hosted a meeting for more than 100 farmers market masters in 2010. With a small grant from the Farmers Market Coalition, Marketing brought in Diane Eggert from the New Y ork Farmers Market Federation to help market masters examine the advantages of coordinating their activities on a statewide level. MDA also received a USDA Federal-State Marketing Improvement Program grant to study the economicimpact of farmers markets and to further develop the concept of creating a Maryland farmers markets association. More than 300 Maryland farmers received approximately $537,000 from the FMNP program in 2010. Funded primarily by the USDA 's Food and Nutrition Service, FMNP is designed to increase the access to local produce for low income citizensand se nior citizens. This benefited 168,411 WIC (Women, Infants and C hildren) recipients in Maryland who purchased fresh produce at farmers markets. Also in 2010, Marketing and partners at the M aryland D epartment of Health and Mental Hygiene successfully rolled out a new program allowing WIC recipients to purchase fresh fruits and vegetables with WICcash value vouchers, in addition to FMNP checks. 15| Office of Marketing, Animal Industries and Consumer Services | VObjective: Increase wholesale market sales opportunities of Maryland agricultural products to retail stores and institutional buyers by three percent per year.

Liberty High School School students (l-r) Owen Linville, Robert Penn and Raleigh Linville receive awards from Agriculture Secretary Buddy Hance for winning the Grand Prize in theMaryland Department of Agriculture's Buy Local Student Video Contest for their video,\"Maryland Farm to School.\" International Marketing Marketing's international marketing component includes staff resources to represent Maryland processed food companies in Southern United States Trade Association (SUSTA) activities.MDA is a member of SUSTA through its membership in the Southern Association of State Departments of Agriculture, with member states stretching from T exas in the west, Floridain the South and Maryland in the North. SUSTA activities for Maryland have included food trade shows in the European Union, South Korea, Japan, Russia and inbound buyers fromthe United Arab Emerites and Korea. MDA Marketing is also a member of the United States Livestock and Genetics Export Association (USLGE). Through membership in this organization, MDA participated in theGolden Autumn dairy genetics trade show in Moscow in 2010 along with the U.S. Holstein Association. Marketing anticipates hosting Russian buyers as a result of this activityand int roducing the m to Maryland dairy farms as a source of high quality cattle genetics. In 2010, $12,500 state investment in participation in SUSTA and USL GE r esulted in estimated sales of $2.5 million. In othe r int ernational marketing activities, Deputy Secretary Mary Ellen Setting led a trade mission to Havana, Cuba, in November 2010. This r esulted in estimated sales of feed grains from M aryland c ompanies of approximately $12 million.ACReS and Crop Insurance Promotion Marketing houses two federally funded programs, crop insurance promotion and the Maryland Agricultural ConflictResolution Service (ACReS) agricultural mediation program. The crop insurance promotion program is funded withapproximately $324,000 from the USDA Risk ManagementAgency. Through press releases, newsletters, presentations and advertising in agricultural media, this program has successfully increased the participation of Maryland farmers in federalcrop ins urance programs to 6,269 farmers in 2010 from 5,240 in 2007. Farmer investment in crop insurance helps stabilize the Maryland agriculture economy as weather and market volatility mak e far ming a c hallenging sector. In 2010, Maryland farmers received $27.5 million in indemnities from federal crop insurance following a significant drought in portions of the state. 16| Office of Marketing, Animal Industries and Consumer Services | VObjective: Increase the international sales by Maryland agribusinesses and the export of Maryland agricultural products to international markets.

A portion of theproceeds are donated by the author to Maryland's Best.Aquaculture Development Program The Aquaculture Development Program supports the Maryland aquaculture industry through promotional, educa-tional, and technical assistance programs. The program alsocoordinates the statewide aquaculture permit review process. In 2010, there were 71 commercial aquafarms permitted in Maryland. Maryland has seven licensed fee-fishing operationsand more than 50 schools, nature centers, government agen- cies, and private organizations producing fish, shellfish, and aquatic plants for educational and restoration projects. Shellfish aquaculture production is increasing in Maryland as more oyster and clam farms are being established in the Chesapeake and Atlantic Coastal Bays. In 2010, responding to the changes in Maryland's oyster lease law, over 400 existingbottom leaseholders have indicated that they will farm oysterson their planting grounds. The Maryland Aquaculture Review Board, which is chaired by the MD A aq uaculture coordinator, provides monthly interagency review of permits and issues across departmental lines. The aquaculture coordinator works directly with those interested star ting aquaculture businesses in evaluating business feasibility, locating project sites, determining culture methods and completing and filing application packages. In 2010, theboard received over 150 requests for information on aqua-farming and reviewed 17 applications for shellfish aquacultureprojects in Maryland. These included projects proposing toraise shellfish seed, oysters, and clams on shellfish leases. Leaseacreage will certainly expand by more than 50 percent in 2011. The Maryland Aquaculture Coordinating Council is made up of11 designated representatives from academic, regulatory, and political organizations as well as six members from industry appointed by the Governor. The aquaculture coordinator serves as a member of the coordinating counciland p rovides administ rative support. In 2010, the council provided recommendations used to draft and adopt new shellfish leasing r egulat ions. The council also worked in conjunction with DNR, University of Maryland Extension and MARBIDCO to establish an aquaculture financial assistance program for shellfish aquaculture projects. The council also organized and funded a Maryland Aquaculture Conference toprovide information to those seeking to enter the industry. 17| Office of Marketing, Animal Industries and Consumer Services | Seafood Marketing and Aquaculture Development ProgramFarmers and others in the agricultural community who may be embroiled in disputes with family members, neighbors, government agencies, or even lenders got a fresh start by trying mediation through the Maryland ACReS. ACReS is a quick, confidential, no- or low-cost service offered by MDA and is available to Marylanders to help resolve agriculturalrelated disputes before they end up in court. MDA has provided USDA-certified mediation services for 11 years. Mediation is a voluntary, confidential process inwhich a neutral third party (the mediator) assists farmers, agricultural lenders, agencies, families and citizens to resolve disputes in a non-adversarial setting outside of the courts and regulatory process. Mediation is based on the voluntary cooperation and participation of all the involved parties with the assistanc e of mediators provided by MDA. Mediators are trained to serve as non-adversarial, neutral, third parties to help resolve disputes by encouraging the participants to develop a solution that meets their needs. An initial consultationwith program staff and initial mediation session (about twohour s) is p rovided at no charge. If additional mediation sessions are needed, costs are shared by the parties, with full or partial waivers of fees based on income. During the last five years, the total number of request for medi- ation grew from eight in 2005 to 31 in 2010. Of the 31 requests, 22 mediations resulted in a written settlement. Farmers going through mediation have a projected savings of $71,500 in costsassociated with other forms of conflict resolution. Maurice Jones, a farmer from Harford County, demonstrates how to shuck corn to students who later prepared ears of corn for their lunch.The Aquaculture Development Program continues to provide the industry with the opportunity to participate in regional,national, and international trade shows, conferences, fairs,and t ours in order to promote and market Maryland farm- raised products. Cooperative programs and collaboration with the Maryland Watermen's Association, Maryland SeaGrant, Maryland Seafood Marketing Advisory Commission, the National Aquaculture Association, and many other organizations are essential to providing aquafarmers with these opportunities.Seafood Marketing Program The Seafood Marketing Program promotes increased sales and consumption of Maryland seafood and aquaculture products through consumer education, promotion, public relations, andadvertising. The total estimated value of the Maryland seafood industry is more than $700 million. There are 70 processing plants employing 1,217 people and more than 6,000 watermenwho work the Chesapeake Bay. In 2009, watermen landed 55.8 million pounds of seafood at a dockside value of more than $67.3 million. This is an increase in value by 10 percent over 2008. Advertising funds are generated from a $10 surcharge fee collected from commercial fishing and seafood processing licenses. In 2010, the fee garnered $60,600. Funds were used to place advertisements in newspapers and trade journals and forspecial promotions. The use of the $10 surcharge is overseen by the Seafood Marketing Advisory Commission. The Seafood Marketing Advisory Commission is composed of 11 industrymembers who recommend marketing activities. The program's website, www.marylandseafood.org, features information for consumers as well as wholesale and retaildealers of seafood. It includes a searchable database, seafood handling and nutrition information, recipes, cookbook order forms, an annual seafood festival list and information on starting aq uaculture ventures. In 2010, the site had more than 59,761 hits. This is an incr ease from 58,374 hits in 2009. In addition, the public received more than 255,000 pieces of information through the Internet and mailings. The \"Buy Local Maryland Seafood\" campaign was held in July. The promotion included advertising in newspapers and onradio. In addition, point of sale materials were distributed to retailers and a news release issued. In order to promote the sales of Maryland seafood in the fall, the Seafood Marketing Program developed an October promotional campaign, entitled \"Make a Splash withMaryland S eafood.\" Newspaper ads were placed throughout the State and radio ads were aired in Baltimore. The program provided retail markets with point of sale materials. News releases were distributed to the press with Governor O'Malley's proclamation of October is Maryland Seafood Month. Consumer recipe brochures were distributed and informationwas placed on the web site. 18| Office of Marketing, Animal Industries and Consumer Services | VGoal: T o enhance or maintain the economic viability of the Maryland aquaculture industry. VObjective: T o increase the opportunity for new aquaculture business ventures.

Advertising campaigns included: Celebrate the Holidays with Maryland Seafood, Maryland Rockfish Celebration and crab and oyster seasons. The pro- gram placed ads on the Baltimore Orioles radio station duringbaseball games. The program is receiving a portion of the Federal Blue Crab Fishe ry Disaster Funding fr om the N ational Marine Fisheries Service through the Department of Natural Resources. The funding for seafood marketing efforts to alleviate potentialblue crab fishery disaster by creating economic opportunities for commercial crabbers and the processing industry. The marketing funding is earmarked to conduct a public relationsand a dvertising program designed to increase positive awareness of the Maryland crab industry. In 2010, the funding paid for spring and fall seasonal billboard advertisements, advertisements on radio, television, in newspapers and magazines. The three year funding continues through 2012. The program distributed 12 news releases to editors in the mid-A tlant ic region. The topics covered seasonal species, special events and promotions. Consumer education included in these ne ws releases discussed safety, handling, and nutrition information. The releases included photos and recipes with an opportunity for consumers to request more information or recipe brochures by mail, phone or website. These releases are posted on the Maryland seafood website as well as MDA 'smain w ebsite.Program staff participated in trade shows, conferences, exhibits and special seasonal events including: International Boston Seafood Show, East Coast Commercial Fishermen's and Aquaculture Trade Expo, Harbor Day at the Docks in Ocean City, Food & Wine Festival at the National Harbor and the Maryland State Fair. At the events, informational literature, point of sale information and Maryland seafood samples were offered. At the International Boston Seafood Show, space is shared with industry members, assisting them in marketing their products. In 2010, eight companies participated in the state booth and another eight companies were represented in thelargest seafood show in the United States. In a survey of the companies exhibiting in the state of Maryland booth, an estimated increase in sales of over $150,000 and 14 new customers were realized. The program sponsored and administered several seafood cooking contests including: National Oyster Cook-off, Jr. Rockfish Cooking Contest, and National Hard Crab Derby & Fair Cooking Contest. The program conducted a day-longseminar f or chefs in Ocean City discussing sustainability and mar keting. The Seafood Marketing Program administers the Maryland Crab Meat Quality Assurance Program. This voluntary program, which the industry helps fund, provides an extra level ofsanitary inspection and education through the Maryland SeaGrant P rogram. Product and environmental surfaces are microbiologically tested and evaluated for Listeria, E. coli and bacteria plate counts. More than two-thirds of Maryland crabmeat processors belong to the quality assurance program. Staff promotes the participating quality assurance program companies through the website, literature and advertising.Maryland is the only state where such a program exists. The p rogram continues to distribute Maryland seafood information on safety, handling, nutrition and recipes. These are distributed through travel centers, seafood markets, grocery stores, direct consumer requests, trade shows and thewebsite. The program also produces and distributes a variety of point of sale materials including: decorations, pins, table tents, menu inserts, and posters. The program sells the famous Maryland Seaf ood Cookbooks and uses the funds t o offset the cost of printed materials. 19| Office of Marketing, Animal Industries and Consumer Services | Junior Chef Rockfish Cooking Contest winners.20| Office of Marketing, Animal Industries and Consumer Services | The program is responsible for the marketing of Maryland seafood internationally. While there is no funding for such activities, the staff was able to work on several projects through SUSTA (Southern United States Trade Association) activities such as; distributing invitations for Maryland seafood companies that export to participate in various trade shows in Korea, Canada, China, Japan, and Brussels. Through a SUSTA grant, funding was provided that enabled Maryland participation at the European Seafood Show inBrussels. The eight participating companies reported direct sales over $42 million with 230 new sales leads that would result in additional sales of approximately $43.9 million in the next 12 months. VGoal: T o enhance or maintain consumer confidence of the safety and quality of Maryland seafood and to maintain p roduct visibility in the competitive marketplace. VObjective: To incr ease the n umb er of responses consumers generated through marketing campaigns designed to increase visibility and consumer confidence. Performance Measures 2010 Actual Outcome: Numb er ofconsumer 255,011 responses to campaigns Number of hits on website 59,761The Maryland Department of Agriculture Animal Health Program (MDA AH) is responsible for preventing andcontrolling infectious and contagious diseases in Maryland livestock and poultry. Headquarters and regional staff members work closely with counterparts in local, stateand federal government, neighboring states and related animal industries to ensure an efficient team effort for disease prevention, detection and control. A key component of theprogram is the Animal Health Diagnostic Laboratory System. The program is also responsible for responding to all animal emergencies under the State Emergency Operations Plan, Emergency Support Function 16. Animal emergenciesare categorized as 1) animal health emergencies, such as a disease outbreak in livestock or poultry and 2) animals in emergencies, such as a natural disaster. The Animal Health Program provides secondary support to other state agencies manag ing Eme rgency S upport Functions as assigned. The official program regulatory role in protecting and promoting animal welfare is limited to livestock in auctionmarkets and certain aspects of animal transport and exhibition. MDA AH frequently assists local animal control officials and other agencies with welfare issues through fieldconsultat ion,training, investigative support and diagnostic evaluations of affected animals. Program Operations NOTE: Please see \"FY10 Animal Health Program Statistics\" for a summary of selected parameters regarding AnimalHealth operations. StateStat, a statewide statistics tracking program, was implemented by MDA in 2009, to facilitate tracking of operational trends for short and long-term planning pur poses. Selected parameters for the Animal Health Section from the final report are shown at the end of this section. Program Consolidations Laboratory and field operations consolidations in FY10 led to predicted cost savings of approximately $300,000, allowing the program to meet the 2010 budget. These consolidationswere done in r esponse to long-term, ongoing changes in the agriculture community leading to reduced program revenues, increased program operational and personnel costs, and statebudget cuts. With continuing state-wide deficits, Animal Health program staff shortages continued into 2010 due to restrictions on hiring. Although budgeted for three field Animal Health Program21| Office of Marketing, Animal Industries and Consumer Services | veterinarians and five inspectors, field staff at the end of 2010 consisted of one field veterinarian and three inspectors.Laboratory and field operations were maintained due to cross- training and flexibility of existing staff to cover critical duties. The program continues to look for efficiencies in the use ofscarce resour ces while providing quality service to laboratory customers and constituents. Regulatory and Outreach Activities Animal Health regulations and inspections are employed to prevent or control infectious or contagious disease in animalsand f or the pub lic health; to promote animal welfare in markets; and to promote the agriculture industry overall. Where outreach and education can support compliance withregulations and disease prevention, inspectors provide infor-mation and assistanc e to animal o wners,producers and other stakeholders. A total of 429 inspections of various activities, including far ms,exhib itions, auctions and hatcheries were conducted in 2010.Interstate Movement: All animals moving into or out of Maryland or being imported or exported into or from Maryland must be examined for signs of contagious or infectious disease, have required vaccines, and be accompanied by a Certificate of Veterinary Inspection. Animal Health staffprocessed a t otal o f 49,316 total movement permits in FY10. Animal Exhibitions: Through continued outreach and education by program staff, progress continued to be made by fair and show exhibitors and sponsors in implementation oflivestock exhibition regulations, revised in 2008. Animal Health staff inspected 93 exhibitions and processed 6,223 show permits in FY10. The 2010 fair and show season presented more opportunities for disease surveillance and producer educationconcerning biosecurity and the prevention of infectious diseases.VGoal: T o provide affordable, accurate, and timely diag- nostic laboratory services to all Maryland citizens involved in the health care of animals including butnot limited to owners, breeders, producers, proces- sors, veterinarians, exporters, importers, those respon- sible for wildlife, and consumers. VObjective: In fiscal year 2004 the laboratories and headquarters began operating an automated laboratory information system named Vetstar Animal Disease Diagnostic System to reduce reporting time by 15 p ercent. Performance Measures 2010 Actual Output: Number of necropsies performed Number of laboratory tests 63,890 Quality: Average number of days from 0.5 necropsy accession to completion ofpresumptive report Percentage of preliminary necropsy 96 reports completed within one business day ofa presumptive diagnosis Efficiency:Numb er ofnecropsies per 2,068 actual FTE veterinarianVGoal: T o ensure that Maryland's agricultural animals and animal products continue to meet or exceed health requirements for interstate commerce,international trade, and sale within Maryland. VObjective: Continued recognition by the United States Department of Agriculture of Maryland's highestofficial status in all Cooperative Animal DiseaseControl/Eradication or other programs in which the Animal Health Program participates. Performance Measures 2010 Actual Output: Equine infectious anemia 16,306 tests performed in MDA laboratories Outcome: Numb er of non-avian, non-aquatic animals 11,730 certified for interstate movement from Maryland (export) Number of non-avian, non-aquatic 37,760animals certified for interstate movement into Maryland (import) VObjective: Annually prevent cancellation of comme rcial livestock events by preventing, detecting and controlling indicated, exotic, foreign, and emerging animal diseases Performance Measures 2010 Actual Output: Number of imported horses 113/33 quarantined in MD for contagious equine metritis testing (mares/stallions)The field inspection staff, augmented by other program staff, exhibition officials and trained volunteers, inspected and tested livestock and poultry upon entry to events and during the course of the exhibition. Animals with signs of infectious or contagious disease were isolated and excluded from the exhibition. Outreach to 4-H and other fair and show exhibitorsand sponsors was conducted throughout the year to educate animal owners in the recognition and isolation of diseased animals prior to an exhibition, providing increased protectionagainst the spread of contagious and infectious disease. Fair sponsors have increased their efforts significantly in gate inspections and overall animal health control activities. Livestock and Poultry Auctions: All commercial livestock auctions in Maryland are inspected by Animal Health staff; in 2010, staff inspected 271 auctions. During the inspections, animals are observed for signs of infectious or contagious disease, including foreign animal diseases, and compliance with welfare, identification and other market regulations.No violations of market regulations, and no contagious or infectious diseases of significance were detected at auctions in 2010. Biologics: The program issued 52 authorization letters to pharmaceutical companies or veterinarians allowing use of abiologic ag ent in M aryland, usually vaccines. A restriction on the use of Chick Embryo Origin (CEO) Infectious Larygotracheitis Vaccine in poultry was continued in 2010 to prevent thespread of this disease associated with vaccine use. Tissue Residue Inspections: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) contracts with the Animal Health Program to conduct follow-up investigations of violations of antibiotic residues in food animals. This program is one of the tools used to address this high priority public health issue. In2010, staff performed eight \"Violative Tissue Residue Inspections\" for FDA. Contagious Equine Metritus Import Quarantine Station: Maryland hosts two CEM quarantine stations in partnership with private facilities; one of these stations was opened inAugust of 2009 and is still in provisional approval status. At the quarantine station, imported horses receive extensive testing to ensure they are free of CEM prior to being released forbreeding a ctivity in the United States. The program issued 115 import permits through the CEM program in FY10.Animal Traceability/Animal ID: This year saw major changes in the federal USDA National Animal Identification System (NAIS); the program was in large part turned over to states and renamed Animal Disease Traceability (ADT). The goal is to use automated recordkeeping, similar to that used for tracking packages, to trace the movements of animals implicated in adisease outbreak within 24-48 hours. While identifying the animals of concern is a priority, an equal or greater priority is identifying those animals, farms and facilities that are notinvolved in a disease investigation, so they can resume normal commerce with little or no delay, minimizing economic losses and business disruptions. Federal directives are expected torequire official tagging of all animals moving interstate; there-fore, Maryland is working with neighboring states to develop a cooperative and efficient approach to meeting this objective. T o date, property owners and operators with livestock have registered 1,558 premises in Maryland. This represents approximately 20 percent of Maryland producers. T o increaseparticipation, program staff along with federal and industrypartners, are working on ways to effectively integrate animal identification with existing production, marketing and disease control systems. The ADT staff aggressively registered poultrypremises t o comply with legislation enacted in 2005. T o date, 3,065 p oultry premises are registered under the state program. The database has been used to notify and educate poultry producers ofbiosecurity recommendations and testing availability, and has been used to locate flocks adjacent to farms where avian influenza has been suspected. The databaseallowed staff to quickly identify nearby premises, visit them to test birds and provide appropriate information for those producers. Emergency Response Readiness The emergency response capacity of the program remains high through the continued training and provisioning of a department-wide Agriculture Responders unit, consisting ofMDA personnel assigned and trained to respond to all agricul-tural emergencies, including animal emergencies. In addition, Animal Health Program personnel continue to collaborate with the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, theMaryland Eme rgency Management Agency (MEMA), the State Board of Veterinary Medical Examiners and the Maryland veterinary community to recruit, train and organize the State Voluntary Veterinary Corps, a group of approximately 230 veterinarians and technicians willing to support emergency operations when activated. In 2010, the program sponsoredEme rgency M anag ement Response System (EMRS) training, refresher training in respirator and other personal protective 22| Office of Marketing, Animal Industries and Consumer Services |23| Office of Marketing, Animal Industries and Consumer Services | equipment use, as well as Foreign Animal Disease training for Animal Health personnel. All Animal Health field and laboratory technical staff received ICS 100 and 200 training under the departmental Emergency Operations and Incident Command System/Unified Command Plan. Animal Health staff participated in two actual statewide emergency responses in 2010. These responses were 1) MEMAactivation for the February 2010 snowstorm and related barnand chicken house collapses, and 2) MEMA activation for Hurricane Earl emergency and animal sheltering preparations. In the snowstorm event, more than 60 animal housing unitswere impacted during the snowstorm, and Animal Health staff worked collaboratively with the MDA Resource Conservation office, state department of the Environment, local environ-mental and animal control agencies to resolve subsequent animal welfare, depopulation and disposal issues. Vomitoxin (fungal infestation of cereal grains) investigations in grain and animals, and no vel H1N1 s urveillance in swine continued into early 2010. Staff participat ed in n umerous multistate industry emergency readiness planning activities and exercises, particularly for avian infl uenza preparedness. The program is a national leaderwith othe r Delmarva partners in developing improved technologies and tactics for detecting and responding to emergency p oultry diseases, and p rotecting worker health during outbreak response, and is a member of the Delmarva Emergency Poultry Disease Task Force. Disease Surveillance and Response The Animal Health program oversees or conducts ongoing routine and active or enhanced surveillance for several live- stock and poultry diseases, including foreign animal diseases.Enhanced surveillance is an increased frequency or number of tests for a disease of particular significance or risk. Specific surveillance programs and/or investigations are highlightedbelow. A total of six foreign animal disease investigations were conducted in FY10. Other livestock diseases and issues such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE or mad cow disease) in cattle, brucellosis in cattle, illegal garbage feeding to swine,vesicular stomatitis in horses and scrapie in sheep and goats continued to be part of our surveillance programs. Quarantines: As a result of disease surveillance and response efforts in FY10, 13 quarantines (\"hold orders\") were placedand 16 q uarantines ere released on farms for contagious equine metritis, piroplasmosis in horses, equine herpesvirus, rabies in cattle and horses, infectious laryngotracheatis in poultry, vesicular stomatitis in horses, swine garbage feeding, and routine 30 day quarantines for swine entering the state. Equine Piroplasmosis: New cases of Equine Piroplasmosis, a tick-borne disease in T exas quarterhorses prompted trace backs throughout the United States, with a total to date of 108confirmed cases across the nation since November 2009. No positive cases have been detected in Maryland, although there was one trace back to Maryland investigated. Swine Influenza: The H1N1 pandemic influenza in 2009 gave rise to enhanced surveillance in swine by the Animal Health program, and this enhanced surveillance continued through the 2010 spring influenza season. All swine with influenza likesigns (ILI), including swine at auctions, exhibitions, and farmsor presenting for necropsy, were tested for influenza. No positive H1N1 swine was detected in Maryland in 2010;however, an outbreak of swine influenza, H3N2, nonpathogenicto humans, occurred in October 2010 and affected more than 200 pigs. This disease, frequently detected and common in other regions of the United States, has not been documentedin M aryland in r ecent history. Avian I nfluenza: The p rogram c ontinues enhanced surveil- lance for avian influenza and other high consequence diseases of poultry in commercial and non commercial flocks through federal funding. The program performed a total of 9,821 AItests in FY10. No avian influenza was detected in poultry inFY10 in M aryland. Contagious conta- metritis in the United States in 2008 continuedthrough 2009 and 2010. CEM is classified as a foreign animaldisease, and is a bacterial venereal disease of horses which maycause inf ertility. Its presence in U.S. horses has significant economic consequences. As of the end of 2010, a total of 28 horses in e ight states linked to the 2008 outbreak have tested positive for the disease. Animal Health staff concluded one trace back investigation of a Maryland horse in FY10, and has had a total of six trace back investigations; all cases testednegative for the disease. Because of the extensive experience with the state's CEM quarantine station and laboratory capacity, Maryland is an important part of the nationalresponse t o the CEM int roduction.Johne's Disease: Johne's disease in cattle continues to be a serious threat to dairy and beef operations. Animal Health employees, working in close cooperation with our cattle industry and federal animal health partners, have enabled Maryland to continue participation in the Voluntary National Johne's Control Program, albeit at decreased levels due to cutsin all federal funding for this activity in 2010. A total of 4,851 Johne's tests were conducted in FY10. In response to federal funding reductions, MDA has focused a great deal of effort on educating producers and on enlisting the support of the attending herd veterinarian to work with the producer to control Johne's disease. Tuberculosis: Maryland remains a \"Bovine Tuberculosis Free State;\" nevertheless, the ongoing reemergence of bovine tuber- culosis (B TB) in cattle and white tailed deer elsewhere in the United States is of concern. BTB has occurred in numerous states during the past several years and appears to be on the rise. The Animal Health program has been heavily involved in national efforts to develop programmatic changes to thenational plan ne eded to reestablish control over this threat to public and animal health Other Animal Health Pr ogram Activities Throughout the year other MDA Animal Health programs remained active. These included the licensing of livestock markets and dealers, and accreditation of new veterinarians.Maryland also is an active participant in the National PoultryImprovement Plan (NPIP) and continues longstanding obligations to NPIP as well as vigorous participation in recent expansions of NPIP activities in response to avian influenza and salmonella concerns. 24| Office of Marketing, Animal Industries and Consumer Services |25| Office of Marketing, Animal Industries and Consumer Services | 2010 Animal Health Program Statistics July Aug Sept Oct Nov Dec Jan Feb Mar Apr May June FY Parameter 2009 2009 2009 2009 2009 2009 2010 2010 2010 2010 2010 2010 2010 Animal Welfare Investigations 9 1 0 0 2 0 3 6 2 0 1 0 24 Biologic Authorization Letters 3 3 3 2 4 7 10 1 10 1 3 5 52 CEM Permits 9 16 13 18 7 12 7 6 5 7 9 6 115 Certificate of Movement 133 27 179 5 110 57 0 0 0 285 39 0 835 Dealer Inspections 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 2 6 3 4 1 18 Disease Investigations Domest ic (Incl.

Frederick specializes mainly in livestock andhorses while Salisbury specializes in commercial poultry. Themission of the system is to support the animal and publichealth regulatory and emergency support missions of thedepartment, assist veterinarians and producers in maintaininghealthy herds and flocks and to support the regulatory activities of other governmental units involving animal healthmatt ers. T o accomplish this mission, the system performs a wide array of diagnostic procedures on a variety of specimens and samples submitted by producers, agricultural businesses,animal owners, veterinarians and government agencies. Staff and Lab Focus The Frederick Laboratory focuses on food animal livestock and has a staff of four laboratory scientists, a veterinarypatholo gist and tw o office managers. The laboratory has rabies, contagious equine metritis, equine herpes virus, equine infectious anemia, disease diagnostic capab ilities.The lab oratory pathologist/laboratory director determines the nature, causes and effects of livestock, equine, and poultry diseases. Emphasis is placed on changes in organs,tissues and cells caused by reportable diseases which affectfood animal production and the public health. Additionally,the veterinary pathologist mentors senior students from theVirginia-M aryland Regional College of Veterinary Medicine, veterinary pathology graduate students from Johns Hopkins University and the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology.One field veterinarian fills in for the laboratory pathologist/laboratory director. The facility has an incinerator and various staff members are certified to operate it. It serves the lab and Frederick County's animal control facility.The Salisbury Laboratory has a unique poultry diagnostic facility and a staff of one board certified veterinary poultry pathologist/laboratory director, three laboratory scientists,one field inspector, a laboratory technician. The lab has a large molecular diagnostic capability that is dedicated to thedetection of avian influenza, Newcastle disease, infectiousbronchitis virus, infectious laryngotracheitis, mycoplasma gallisepticum ,mycoplasma in serology, bacteriology, and parasitology. The laboratory primarily serves the commercialpoultry industry as well as wild bird testing. The laboratoryalso p erforms equine infectious anemia tests for the horses on the Eastern Shore. Rabies and salmonella diagnostics are carried out at the Salisbury lab, as well as many other specificpoultry disease diagnostic tests. The laboratory personnel participate in disease outbreak surge capacity programs with the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.The facility shares a new laboratory information managementsystem (LIMS) with Delaware which serves poultry producersin Maryland, Delaware and Virginia. Additionally, the laboratory mentors laboratory scientists from the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, laboratory scientists from the Frederick Laboratory in Real Time PolymeraseChain R eaction (RRT-PCR) techniques as well as mentor of Salisbury University, University of Maryland Eastern Shore, and veterinary students. The facility has an incinerator and various staff members are certified to operate it. Statistics for selected livestock and poultry diseases are presented on the following page in Table 2.Animal Health Diagnostic Laboratory System 26| Office of Marketing, Animal Industries and Consumer Services | Bob Robison runs samples through the PCR equipment at the Salisbury Animal Health Diagnostic Laboratory.27| Office of Marketing, Animal Industries and Consumer Services | Laborator y Training/Quality Control and Certifications To ensure the q ualit y oflaboratory services, the laboratory administration develops standards and periodic training for staff. Presently, the administration is gaining laboratoryaccreditation through the International Standards Organization's (ISO) S ection 17025 and the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). Soon, more than 17 laboratory staff will have had two days of ISO 17025/OIE training. This accreditation is administ ered by the American Association of Laboratory Accreditation. The Salisbury and Frederick laboratories are participating in this program. The USDA 's National Animal Health Laboratory Network (NAHLN) has requested thisaccreditation in place of their own program which the laboratories are under presently. The Frederick and Salisbury facilities have been certified as Basic S entinel Clinical Lab oratories by the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DHMH). They participate with the Maryland Laboratory Response Network which providesmicr obial challenge sets from the Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene. These tests are nationally and internationally recognized and check the proficiency levels of the technical staff and are administered by the Laboratory EmergencyPreparedness and Response Committee of DHMH.Table 2: Animal Health Program Laboratory Statistics Diagnostic Activity Number Result Mammalian Necropsy 210 N/A Avian Necropsies 5,853 N/A Avian Influenza by PCR 9,821 All negative Avian Influenza by Flu Detect 2,292 All negative Mycoplasma by PCR 117 32 positive Elisa for poultry diseases 1,276 N/A Rabies 104 4 positive Equine Infectious Anemia 15,948 Contagious Equine Metritis 1,695 All negative Equine Herpesvirus (EHV-1) 40 2 positive Lyme Disease 124 80 positive Johne's Disease in Cattle 4,869 178 positive blood tests (4,361 were serum Enzyme-Linked 156 positive fecal testsImmunosorbent Assay (ELISA) or PCR blood tests and 508 were fecal tests) A new safety and training officer has been appointed to oversee laboratory and field programs. The entire laboratory system staff was trained in shipping biological and chemical materials, and use o fpersonal p rotective equipment and other training recommended by OSHA. This training included the use of standard operating procedures, training materials andtraining records. Training also included workshops on the subject of molecular diagnostics (avian influenza) at the National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Ames, Iowa. The United States Animal Health Association's (USAHA) annual meeting/training was attended by the state veterinarian and three other staff veterinarians. Participation in the following USAHA committees took place: Johne's disease, Nominations and Resolutions, International Standards,Governme nt Relations and the National Assembly of State Animal Health Officials, Laboratory Emergency Management, Laboratory Directors\u2014National Animal Health Laboratory Network, Brucellosis, Infectious Diseases of Horses, Tuberculosis Scientific Advisory Subcommittee, USAHA Committee on Transmissible Diseases of Poultry and otherAvian Species, Committee of Salmonella, Mycoplasma and Infectious Laryngotracheitis Subcommittee of Transmissible Diseases of Poultry and other Avian Species.Animal Health Laboratory Partners and Customers The Maryland Department of Agriculture's Animal Health Diagnostic Laboratories serve and cooperate with a wide rangeof public and private entities including livestock producers, zoological parks, private veterinarians, the Maryland State Board of Veterinary Medical Examiners, the State Chemist,the equine industry, the Delmarva Poultry Industry, the University of Delaware, Salisbury University, the University of Maryland Eastern Shore and state agencies such as thedepartments of Health and Mental Hygiene, Environment, Transportation and Natural Resources, the Maryland Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the MarylandEmergency Management Agency, the Maryland State Highway Administration, the University of Maryland Extension, the Johns Hopkins University, local health departments, and localanimal c ontrol organizations. Federal partners include the USDA-Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Veterinary Services, the National Poultry Improvement Plan, the Centersfor Disease C ontrol and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U.S. Army and theSmithsonian Institution. 28| Office of Marketing, Animal Industries and Consumer Services | The Stat e Board ofVeterinary Medical Examiners (SBVME) is responsible for setting standards by which veterinarians, registered veterinary technicians, and veterinary hospital owners must comply through statutoryand r egulat ory adoptions and amendments. The SBVME also lic enses and registers veterinarians; licenses and inspects veterinary hospitals; licenses animal control facilities; registers veterinary technicians; provides disciplinary information to other state veterinary boards and the public; and submits licensure verification to other state licensing boards upon request. Additionally, the SBVME investigates consumer complaints, initiates its own investigations, and determines whether disciplinary action shall be taken against licensees or registrants. Requests for approval of continuing education credits are reviewed by the SBVME. The SBVME consists of seven members appointed by the Governor to serve five-year terms. Five of the members are veterinarians; of these five members, two must be primarily large animal practitioners. The remaining two members areconsume rs. SBVME staff consists of an executive director, administrative specialist, office secretary, administrative The Maryland State Board of Veterinary Medical Examiners 29| Office of Marketing, Animal Industries and Consumer Services | officer/investigator, and two agricultural inspectors, both of whom split their time between the SBVME and the Maryland Horse Industry Board. The SBVME also funds the work of a part-time assistant attorney general, whose time is devotedexclusively to the SBVME. The SBVME submitted one bill for consideration during the General Assembly's 2010 session. The bill, SB 81, amended theSBVME's maximum civil penalty authority\u2014increasing itfrom $5,000 $10,000 for a second or subsequent offenseonly. First-time violators could be charged up to $5,000. The SBVME reserves its authority to impose this penalty in lieu of, or in addition to suspension of a license, or in additionto revocation of a license. Prior to the signing of SB 81, which became effective October 1, 2010, the SBVME's penalty authority had remained unchanged for over 25 years. Therecognition of three key factors was responsible for theSBVME's proposal: 1.) the existing civil penalty structure was not a cting as an effective deterrent, particularly for repeat violators of the SBVME's laws and regulations; 2.) the mean professional income of veterinarians in private practiceincreased substant ially according to statistics gathered by the American Veterinary Medical Association over a 10-year period; and 3.) the significance of pets\u2014in terms of both financial and e motional in vestment\u2014o n the li ves of humans has also amplified considerably. In addition to a statutory amendment, the SBVME proposed and r eceived approval of regulatory amendments and adoptions in 2010. Regulations undergoing amendments included those pertaining to identification of patient records and theimposition of civil penalties on veterinarians employing nonregistered veterinarians. The SBVME also adopted new regulations setting forth the requirements for the practicaltraining of veterinary students. These regulations were developed pursuant to the signing of SB 78 in 2009. Further, the SBVME provided practitioners with model consent formsfor utilization for senior veterinary students performing surgeries on animals in either a hospital setting or in a humane society/shelter setting. As a result of changes made to the complaint-handling process in 2009, approximately 12 percent more complaints were reviewed by the SBVME within 120 days of initial complaintreceipt than in 2009. Formal or informal disciplinary action (the latter of which may take the form of a letter of advice oradmonition) was issued in approximately 68 percent of all complaints closed during the 2010 fiscal year. This represents a 10 percent increase over the number of actions taken during the 2009 fiscal year. While the percentage of cases closed between the 2008 and 2009 fiscal years had risen by 28, the percentage decreased by16 between the 2009 and 2010 fiscal years. This was largelyattributed to the unanticipated loss of the SBVME's part-timeassistant attorney general in January 2010. This vacancy wasfilled in June, and cases pending earlier in the year are now reaching resolution. This year marked the first during which the SBVME's inspectors began wearing apparel with a logo designed specifically for theSBVME. This new apparel is expected to help the regulatedcommunity and the public more readily identify the inspectorsduring the course of their work for the SBVME. 30| Office of Marketing, Animal Industries and Consumer Services | In September, the City of Baltimore was host to the American Association of Veterinary State Boards (AA VSB), of which the SBVME is a member. This organization convenes annually and is widely attended by member boards for the purposes of discussing and obtaining input on issues facing veterinary boards across the country and in Canada and the U.S. VirginIslands, learning about changes to national board examinations, receiving information about recent legal cases affecting health occupation boards, and providing networking opportunitiesfor board administrators, members, and legal counsel. Chris H. Runde, D.V .M., chairman of the SBVME, provided welcoming remarks to conference attendees, and shared historical information about Maryland and Baltimore, in particular. This year's AA VSB conference was one of the highest attended to date. The biggest hurdle facing the SBVME's staff continues to be the process by which licensees re-register annually. Research has begun with respect to making changes in the currentprocess, with the anticipation that electronic filing ofapplicat ions will become a reality over the next two years.VGoal: T o protect the public and animal health and welfare through effective licensure or registration ofveterinarians, veterinary technicians, and veterinary hospitals on an annual basis. VObjective: T o maintain the processing of completed registration applications, including all necessary supporting documents, and issue registrations within 30 days of receipt. Performance Measures 2010 Actual Output: Registrations issued for veterinarians 2,305 Registrations issued for veterinary hospitals 493 VGoal: T o provide effective and efficient inspections of veterinary hospitals. VObjective: By June 2011, 100 percent of all veterinary hospitals licensed in the State will pass inspection annually. Performance Measures 2010 Actual Output: Number of hospitals inspected 521 Number of initial T otal conducted *548 Number of hospitals receiving 22follow-up inspections Quality: Percent of hospitals passing inspection 99 *At the c lose of fiscal year 2010, there were 500 veterinary hospitals. 521 hospitals were inspected over the course of the year.

The Weights andMeasures Program ensures that consumers get what they pay for whether it is a gallon of gasoline, a truckload of gravel, or a pound of hamburger. Purchases that requiremeasurement affect virtually every consumer in the state and involve millions of individual transactions annually. Having uniform standards of measurement creates fairnessand confidence in the marketplace, and benefits both buyers and sellers. MDA is an active, voting member of the National Conference on Weights and Measures (NCWM). The NCWM is comprisedof state and federal government officials as well as private industry representatives from throughout the United States. The NCWM p rovides a forum for the discussion and development of uniform policy and protocols that guide the r egulat ion ofweights and measures.There are a total of 60,642 weighing and measuring devices in commercial use in Maryland at 7,162 separate businesseslocations. The department has 18 inspectors who are specially trained and certified to test and inspect these devices according to established protocols to make sure they are within therequired tolerances. Devices failing inspection may be taken out of service until corrected by the owner. Inspectors also visit stores to verify that packaged products contain the quantities specified, and that consumers are being charged the correct prices at checkout. In FY2010, the field staff conducted 42,024 device inspections. Inspectors also tested11,716 individual lots of prepackaged commodities. Price verification inspections were conducted at 65 non food stores. Inspectors found significant deviations from the advertisedprices in a number of stores. Nine firms received civil penaltiesfor misrepresenting unit price violations. In FY2010, Weightsand M easures imposed $82,500 in civil penalties for violations. 32| Office of Marketing, Animal Industries and Consumer Services | Weights and MeasuresIn FY2010, field staff investigated 464consumer complaints. The majority of the complaints were relatedto gasoline sales. Consumer complaints are given priority overroutine inspections and require a signifi- cant amount of staffhours to investigate. The registration of approximately 7,000 businesses has cr eated a database that has become an e ffective management tool. It allows administrativestaff to target themost critical areas and provides eachfield insp ector with a tool to plan their inspection work more efficiently, thereby reducing driving time and providing more uniform inspection coverage. This information has helpedmanag ement prioritize the use of limited program resources to better protect Maryland consumers and maintain a level playing field for industries that operate in the State. Maryland's Metrology Laboratory maintains primary standards of mass, length, volume and temperature that are legally traceable to the National Institute of Standards and T echnology and provides a measurement capability at the state level that isconsistent with national measurement goals. The laboratory is recognized by the National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP) for compliance with criteriaset forth in T he International Standard ISO/IEC 17025:1999 and relevant requirements of ISO 9002:1994. The NVLAP is an ind ependent agency under NIST, which accredits testing and calib ration laboratories that are found competent to perform specific tests or calibrations, or types of tests or calibrations.The Weights and Measures Programalso participates in the National Type Evaluation Program(NTEP) which tests and inspects the accu- racy of new measuringdevices and measuring systems before they are approved for use incommerce. NTEP lab- oratories are authorized r equired NTEP performance standards and p rocedures denotes a hig h degree of technical and pro- fessional competence. Authorization is specific to a type of weighing or measuringdevice. The Maryland NTEP laboratory is authorized in 14 ar eas o fevaluation. All related costs are paid by the participating manufacturers requesting NTEP services. Future program goals are to replace aging testing equipment and vehicles necessary to carry out the program's duties. Muchneeded replacements are, a vehicle scale test truck, trailers usedto transport volumetric testing vessels and vans to carry andtow testing equipment. Due to past budgetary issues the fieldproblem is funded entirely with special funds, which have notmatched inflation. In order to maintain market confidence,Weights and M easures is needed today, just as in the past, and seeks the funding to maintain this vital service in the 2011 General Assembly. 33| Office of Marketing, Animal Industries and Consumer Services | Weights and Measures is just as important today, as it was in the past, to maintain market confidence.

Commodities meeting the criteria established by USDA and/or MDA standards areidentified and certified by MDA graders. Official certification provides a uniform basis for the marketing of agricultural commodities that enhances the marketability of Maryland commodities. Foreign countries, wholesale food suppliers,large grocery store chains, and state institutions, among others,often require official certification to ensure they are purchasingagricultural commodities that meet their specifications. Theprovision of a cost-effective and service-oriented grading programis crucial t o Maryland p roducers competing in these markets. The p rimar y commo dities graded by the section this year were 365.6 million pounds of poultry, 50.7 million pounds of shell eggs, 23.3 million pounds of meat, 41.8 million pounds ofgrain and 12 million pounds of fruits and vegetables. Many buyers require compliance audits of production practices in addition to the certification of product. The section conducts complianc e audits o fagricultural production facilities for compliance with standards for animal welfare, good agricultural practices, food security, food safety and quality assurance programs. As buyers and consumers continue to demand verification of compliance with standards for animal welfare and food safety, the section anticipates increased demand forcomplianc e audits o f these practices. Additional staff members are being trained to accommodate the anticipated increase in audit r equests. The agricultural commodity industry has continued to change and the section has adapted to these changes by offering theservices necessary for the industry to market their products. The number of Good Agricultural Practices audits conducted has continued to increase as more wholesale and retail chainbuyers are requiring the audits after recent high profile out- breaks such as an E. coli outbreak in spinach and a salmonella outbreak in tomatoes and jalapenos have caused increased concern about food safety and fresh produce. The program has received an $80,000 grant through the USDA to develop and implement a Good Agricultural Practices program gearedtowards smaller producers selling fruits and vegetables directly to school systems and consumers and an additional $140,000to assist producers selling wholesale in implementing a food safety program. These two programs will assist producers in meeting increasingly stringent federal requirements for pro-ducing fresh fruits and vegetables. Egg Inspection The Egg Inspection Program is responsible for enforcement of the Maryland Egg Law. Inspections are performed at the wholesale, food service and retail level to ensure eggs sold in our state meet the standards established for quality, size,refrigeration, microbial and physical contamination, labeling and record keeping. The section is also responsible for the registration of egg wholesalers and packers. Portions of thelabeling, record keeping and registration requirements weredeveloped to provide traceability in the event of a Salmone lla enteritidis outbreak. Other sections of the law were established to reduce the risk of consumers purchasing eggs that could cause f ood-borne il lness. Eggs found to be out of compliance with the estab lishe d standar ds ar e removed from sale and violation notices are issued to the responsible party. The inspection activities are funded through the collection of$.0026 per dozen of eggs sold in Maryland. The percentage of eggs sampled found to be in compliance with the Maryland Egg Law increased to 88.6 percent this year compared to 86.8 percent last year. The lots inspecteddecreased slightly due to a short term vacancy in the program.The egg inspection chart shows comparison data for the eggs inspected and violations. 35| Office of Marketing, Animal Industries and Consumer Services | Food Quality Assurance 01000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 7000 8000 Egg Inspection Lots Inspected V iolationsLots Inspected/Violations 2007 2008 2009 2010The largest egg related outbreak of food borne illness from Salmonella enteritidis occurred this year. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration traced the outbreak to two producers neither of which was registered to produce eggs for Maryland sales. MDA inspectors stepped up inspections to verify none of these eggs were offered for sale in Maryland. The program has continued conducting Country of Origin labeling reviews for the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The reviews are conducted in conjunction with egg inspectionsand the federal reimbursement for Country of Origin reviews has assisted with reducing the costs associated with conducting egg inspections. This has allowed the program to inspect moreeggs in 2009 and 2010 than 2007 and 2008.Organic Certification The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) accredited Maryland Organic Certification Program certified 87 farms and 23 handlers of organic products in Maryland in 2010.The program also registered an additional 19 farms as organic that are exempt from the inspection requirements. Maryland organic producers and handlers continue to benefit from the federal Cost-Share Reimbursement Program fundedby USDA. This cost-share program allowed MDA to reimburse 75 percent of the inspection costs growers paid for certification. This program is expected to continue through 2012. Grain Laws All persons in the business of buying, receiving, exchanging or storing grain from a grain producer are regulated by thissection. Licenses are issued to businesses that meet requirements set by law for insurance and financial status. There are four categories o flicenses issued based on the number of bushels purchase d in a cale ndar y ear. Fees range from $50 to $300. A Directory of Licensed Grain Dealers is published and distributed annually. The section licensed 48 businesses with 74 business locations in 2010. Poultry and Rabbit Slaughter A ne w program has been developed and implemented to assist small poultry and rabbit producers to slaughter their animals on farm and sell them to restaurants, at farmer's markets andothe r locations within Maryland. The program consists of food safety training, basic food safety requirements during slaughter, and inspections to verify good food safety practices are followed. Producers who follow the requirements are certified by MDA. The program was started in May of 2010and alr eady over 140 producers have been trained and 20 producers have been successfully certified. 36| Office of Marketing, Animal Industries and Consumer Services | 37| Office of Marketing, Animal Industries and Consumer Services | VGoal: T o ensure standards for quality, weight, production practices, labeling and freedom from physical and microbial contaminants are consistently applied by all program employees on all regulated commodities and facilities.

Originally knownas the Maryland State Fair Board, the office was based at the Maryland State Fairgrounds in Timonium. When the Maryland Department of Agriculture (MDA) was establishedthe office was moved to Annapolis and renamed the Maryland Agricultural Fair Board. The board falls within MDA 's marketing office. The board is composed of nine members appointed by the Governor. T erm of office is five years and a member may serve a maximum of two terms. They may come back on the board after a break in service. The current board divided the stateinto regions that each board member manages. When a board vacancy occurs, all organizations funded within that region may no minate a replacement. The board meets three times a year and communicates throughout the year by phone and e-mail. Most me etings are held at MDA headquarters in Annapolis. The board is managed by an executive secretary who is employed by the MDA on a part-time basis. Funding comesthrough the Racing Commission through a special grant that is funded by unclaimed pari-mutuel tickets and various fees.The cur rent ann ual b udget is $1.6 million. The grant process starts in D ecember and is finalized by May 15. Grants to fairs and sho ws may be used for ribbons, awards, and premiums. Currently the b oard funds ap proximately 150 events. These range from the Maryland State Fair, to county fairs, local community shows, youth activities in 4-H and FFA. The board publishes an annual guide to fairs and shows in Maryland that the y fund. These brochures are placed in all welcome centers along state highways, all University of Maryland Extension offices, all Fairs and Shows, all chambers of commerce and all Maryland libraries. Racing revenue is off for the first time in many, many years and the board's FY10 grants were reduced. The board holdsregional budget meetings throughout the State with each group to review their request, financial reports, and fair activities. 38| Office of Marketing, Animal Industries and Consumer Services | Maryland Agricultural Fair Board VGoal: To provide opportunities for Maryland citizens to learn about Maryland's agriculture industrythrough fairs, shows, and youth events.

Thiswas the only year in the memory of mosquito control personnel (dating back to 1957) when counts of mosquito activity taken at more than 30 surveillance sites in DorchesterCounty\u2014where mosquitoes reach their greatest numbers\u2014 were all negative for Ochlerotatus sollicitans , the salt marsh mosquito. An abundance of surface and groundwater recharged with melt from the record breaking snow falls combined with early warm spring temperatures pushed an early foliation of trees in the spring. The resulting thick canopy was detrimental toeffective control of mosquito larvae in sylvan wetlands with aerial application of liquid Bti. The months of May and June saw no sp raying for adult or larval mosquitoes by aircraft. The months of June and July also broke records for high tem- peratures and r ainfal l was lo w. Low rainfall and average tidal exchange on the salt marshes resulted in reduced numbers of salt marsh mosquitoes through most of the season. Tidalaction and precipitation returned to typical seasonal levelsduring late August-October with a corresponding bounce inthe salt marsh mosquito population. The number of acressprayed by aircraft in 2010, 105,653, was well below the 34 year average of 159,284. Culex salinarius and othe r associated species that breed in marshes and no n-tidal w etlands w ere not iceably lower in numbers in 2010. The number dropped significantly in areas where they typically comprise more than half of the total of mosq uito collections, particularly in areas west of the Chesapeake Bay. Aedes albopictus , the Asian tiger mosquito, increased as percentage of the total of mosquitoes collected in the central region of the state. This species, exclusively a con-taine r breeder, is primarily found in the urban and suburban environment where it lives in close association with people. Containers of all types, from flower pots to tire casings,discar ded cans and b ottles, plast ic tarps, boat bilges and tree holes serve as breeding habitat. A very small amount of rain o r irrigation provides sufficient water for this species to prosper. There is evidence that drier than normal conditions are beneficial to tiger mosquito breeding success because abundant rainfall fills breeding containers causing them tooverflow,which flushes tiger mosquito larvae to the ground where they quickly die. Tiger mosquito infestations continue to drive the demands for services, particularly in urban andsuburban ar eas of central Maryland. This is most evident in Anne Arundel County where the level of communityparticipation has increased to 254 from 156 in 2004. As an indication of public interest in mosquito control service, thereare about 100 communities waiting to enter the program in the central region. The role of the tiger mosquito in disease cycles remains unclear. However, laboratory studies haveshown the tiger to be a competent disease vector and viruses have been isolated from field-collected tigers in Maryland and other states. The tiger mosquito is the predominant pest andvector mosquito in all major metropolitan centers where a significant increase in cases of West Nile virus occurred. Biological Control and Permanent Work Biological mosquito control continued with the stocking of fish in ponds and open marsh water management (OMWM).OMWM is a mosquito control method of applied ecology, which seeks t o regulate mosquito populations by enhancing the access of predatory fish to populations of developing mosquito larvae. Properly designed and implemented,OMWM projects can eliminate and greatly reduce the needfor follow up applications of insecticides to control larvalmosquitoes. Numerous studies have indentified the benefits ofOMWM in imp roving overall marsh productivity, promoting biodiversity and increasing use by waterfowl. However,OMWM p rojects will cause changes to the marsh and great care must b e employed to minimize unwanted changes to marsh flora and fauna. The number of acres that can be put in OMWM has b een reduced greatly by DNR restrictions. Mosquito Contr ol Sour ce Reduction Pr ojects 2009-2010 Mosquito control source reduction projects completed during the 2009-2010 season were conducted on both tidal and non-tidal wetlands throughout Somerset County and on Bishop's Head in Dorchester County (sites are listed on thenext pag e).These projects have resulted in effective, long- term mosquito control and a reduction of insecticide use on a benefited area of 744.5 acres. In addition to accomplishing the department's Integrated Pest Management (IPM) goals, theLong Point Road project in Dames Quarter included the re-establishment of a natural pond that through erosion hadbecome a t idal m ud flat. This reclamation project has shown an increased benefit to wildlife and will reduce nutrient flow into Tangier Sound. Previous inspection of the Crisfield dike system also revealed an ar ea requiring extensive repair to prevent further erosion. This maintenance project took place in the Johnson Creek vicinity at a problematic section that has required constant repair. MDA, with support from the Somerset County 39| Office of Plant Industries and Pest Management | Mosquito ControlDepartment of Solid Waste and Drainage, constructed an extensive wooden weir and tide gate structure to strengthen the dike system and prevent further erosion of the salt marsh and sedimentation into Johnson Creek. Future maintenance and structural enhancement projects are planned in this area to improve the integrity of the dike system and further reducesedimentation onto this wetland. Permits have been obtained to continue source reduction projects in the 2010-2011 permanent work season. Futuresource reduction projects will depend on our ability to obtain permits and the operating condition of the amphibious excavators which require extensive maintenance due to morethan 20 years of service on the salt marsh. Long-term biological control of mosquito larvae can be accomplished through the release of Gambusia holbrook i minnows (mosquitofish) into permanent bodies of water. The use of this native species of fish is a cost-effective natural method of control since these minnows are highly adaptiveand, once estab lishe d, will produce a self-sustaining population. They are predaceous on many species of mosquito larvae and are considered an essential component of a strong IPM program. During the 2010 mosquito season, 6,939 Gambusia were released at 37 sites in six counties. The habitat type consisted of ornamental ponds and stormwater retention ponds. Theseartificial wetlands are ideal sites to release mosquitofish since they tend to lack piscivores, which allows the mosquitofishpopulat ion to become established. These wetland types are also very capable of producing large broods of mosquitoes dueto their design and, coupled with their close proximity to resi- dences and businesses, long-term mosquito control is necessary to minimize nuisance and arboviral disease exposure. Mosquito-borne Disease Surveillance MDA, working with the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DHMH), completed to 10th year of a cooperative effort to monitor the occurrence and distributionof mosquito-borne pathogenic virus in Maryland. A total of 23,043 mosquitoes was collected, separated into 2,219 pools and analyzed for virus at the DHMH laboratory in Baltimore.MDA technicians collected five samples from two jurisdictions (Anne Arundel - 4, Baltimore - 1) that tested positive for West Nile virus. An additional three samples testing positive forWest Nile virus were collected in Montgomery County byDepartment of Defense personnel. Maryland reported 23human cases of West Nile virus including two fatal cases(Baltimore - 1, Montgomery - 1). Human cases were distributed as follows: Anne Arundel - 3, Baltimore City - 3, Baltimore County - 12, Howard - 1, Montgomery - 4. The majority of cases (21) occurred in communities that do notparticipat e in a dult mosquito control service. The number of cases nat ionwide increased to 972 as of this report from the final count of 720. A sharp increase in the number of casesreported from the Northeast region of the United States occurred in 2010. The regional number of cases increased from 19 in 2009 to 266 in 2010. Estimates of the costs ofillness are difficult to determine, however, scholars have placedthe cost for an uncomplicated case with full recovery at $1,000per case and the c ost o f neuroinvasive illness at $27,000 per case. In addition to the above reported cases, two human cases of LaCrosse encephalitis (Harford - 1, Garrett - 1) and one case o f dengue fever (Calvert) were reported in 2010. A single equine West Nile virus cased was reported in Frederick County. Public Education Public education continues to be an important part of our mosquito control program, particularly with the continuing problems created by the introduction and spread of the Asiantiger mosquito. The predominant types of public education this season were media interviews and school functions. Nine interviews were conducted this season by mosquito control or public relationsoffice emplo yees, with both print and TV media outlets through the state. Outreach was done at 12 different school functions in 2010, in Prince George's, Calvert and Wicomico counties. Theseincluded a science fair, a general insect and mosquito 40| Office of Plant Industries and Pest Management | Mosquito Control Source Reduction Projects 2009-2010 Bishop's Head 20 acres Tylerton, Smith Island Phase I 3.25 acres Crisfield Dike System 189.3 acres Deal Island Road Phase III 304.4 acres Long Point Road, Dames Quarter 83.9 acres Tylerton, Smith Island Phase II 3.25 acres Handy Church, Marion Station 1.0 acreJanes Island State Park 139.4 acres T otal Benefited Acres 744.50 acrespresentation, a career day and Prince George's County's science quiz show, and The Science Bowl. In addition, Calvert County sent out over 14,000 brochures to all school children in Calvert County schools. Mosquito control employees spoke at five community meetings in Prince George's, Calvert and Anne Arundel counties, anddid three mass-yard inspections for Asian tiger mosquito breeding sites in Prince George's and Howard counties. Six training sessions were offered in 2010 for groups such as Master Gardeners, University of Maryland Extension,departments of health and city groups. Employees spoke at two professional meetings (Southern Maryland Urban Pest Management Conference and Annual Meeting of the Mid-Atlantic Mosquito Control Association). Asian tiger mosquitodisplays were set for a month in each of in three countylibraries this season: two in Prince George's and one in Anne Arundel. The effects of public education efforts are difficult to quantify, particular ly with media interviews and library displays. However, over 600 people were in attendance at the events with known participant levels. Interactions with Other Agencies The cooperative effort between MDA and DHMH for mosquito-borne surveillance of pathogenic virus is of great benefit to the citizens of Maryland. Live mosquitoes are collected, identified and processed by MDA staff and sent to the DHMH Laboratories in Baltimore for virus isolation. Finding s of virus in mosquito populations usually precede human cases and allow for responses from MDA and localhealth authorities and the public to take personal precautions to avoid or reduce risk factors. DHMH a dministers a federal grant for supporting vector-borne disease surveillance and provides funding to MDA to supportfield activities. Unfortunately, the level of federal funding has been sharply cut over the past six years and currently pays about 10 percent of the actual cost incurred by MDA. MDA anticipates continued cooperation with DNR, MDE, The U .S.Fish and Wildlife Service and the Army Corps of Engineers in with applications and review processes for Toxic Materials Permits and National Pesticide Discharge Eliminat ion System and for future OMWM and marsh restoration projects. Cooperation between these agencies is essential to providing mosquito control in Maryland's lowerEastern Shore, where the most severe mosquito problems occur.| Office of Plant Industries and Pest Management | 41VGoal: Maintain the adult mosquito population below the level that causes unacceptable annoyance tohumans. VObjective: Adult mosquito population in communities participating in the MDA mosquito control program will be below the annoyance action threshold 70 percent of the days between May 1 and October 31 and customer satisfaction will be 80 percent or greater.

The primary functions of the section are to enforce state and federal pesticide use laws and regulations and to ensure that pesticides are applied properly by competentindividuals so that potential adverse effects to human health and the environment are prevented. The PRS contains five major programs: (1) Pesticide Applicator Certification andTraining: (2) Pesticide Use Inspection and Enforcement; (3) Pesticide T echnical Information Collection and Dissemination; (4) Integrated Pest Management in Schools and on SchoolGrounds: and (5) Special Programs. Pesticide Applicator Certification and Training Two types of pesticide applicators are certified by the PRS\u2014 private and c ommercial. Private applicators are farmers and other individuals applying restricted-use pesticides to their own land or rented land for the purpose of producing agricul-tural commodities. Commercial applicators apply general useand restricted use pesticides as employees of licensed pest control businesses, not-for-hire businesses or public agencies. A total o f72 ne w private applicators were certified in 2010 for a thr ee-year period after passing a closed book examination administered by section personnel during exam sessions. One thousand tw o hundr ed seventy-seven private applicators renewed their certificates by attending recertification training. Currently, there are 3,328 certified private applicators. Sectionstaff approved and monitored 105 private applicator recertifi- cation training sessio ns that the University of Maryland Extension, MDA, or the pesticide industry conducted. A total of 564 new commercial pest control applicators and consultants were certified in one or more of the 13 categories ofpest control by satisfying minimum experience or education requirements and by passing written certification exams. The section certified 1,051 public agency applicators in 2010, bringing the total number of certified commercial, publicagency applicators and consultants to 4,331. In 2010, a total of 18 exam sessions were held during which 2,130 exams wereadminist ered to 825 ap plicants. Once certified, commercial applicators are required to participate in at least one update training session approved by MDA each year in order to renewtheir certificates. Three hundred twenty-four recertification training sessions for commercial pesticide applicators were approved and monitored by this section and were conductedby the pesticide industry, the University of Maryland Extension, or the department. By attending recertificationtraining, 3,991 applicators were recertified in 2010. During 2010, the section licensed 1,458 commercial businesses and 173 not-for-hire businesses to apply pesticides and to perform pest control services. Three hundred nineteen publicagency permits were issued to governmental agencies that apply pesticides. Forty-one pest control consultant licenses were issued. A total of 2,669 registered employee identificationcards were issued during 2010. The department currently has 15,060 employees of pesticide businesses and public agencies registered to apply pesticides under the supervision of certifiedapplicators. A total of 120 dealer permits were issued to businesses that sell restricted use pesticides. 46| Office of Plant Industries and Pest Management | Pesticide Regulation Section Super vising Inspectors Ellis T insley and Petey Councell conduct an inspection at a bulk pesticide storage facility to assure that pesticide storage, repackaging, mixing and loading operations are meeting state and federalregulations to protect the environment.Pesticide Use Inspection and Enforcement Besides enforcing state pesticide laws, MDA enforces federal pesticide laws under a Cooperative Enforcement Agreement with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).Routine inspection activities are conducted throughout the year and include use observations and inspections of businesses, public agencies, dealers, market places and producer establish-ments. Consumer complaint and pesticide misuse investigations also are conducted by the staff. In 2010, 807 routine business inspections were performed during which 276 businesses were cited for violations of thePesticide Applicators Law and Regulations. Seventy-eight pesticide dealer inspections were conducted to ensure that restricted use pesticides were sold only to certified applicators. Seventy-nine use observations were conducted, during which pest inspections and pesticide applications performed by comme rcial and p rivate applicators were observed by section personnel. A total of 37 consumer complaints were investigated. Under the federal cooperative agreement, 26 pesticide producer estab lishme nts and 29 mar ket place insp ections were conducted. Other enforcement actions taken during 2010 included the assessment 60 civil penalties totaling $18,970. In the last q uarter of FY 2010, the PRS began conducting compliance assistance inspections at commercial agricultural pesticide application firms, custom blending operations and agricult ural pesticide refilling establishments. PRS inspectors conduct inspections of bulk pesticide storage containers and mixing and loading pads at these facilities to ensure they are in compliance with state and federal regulations. These regulations were developed to protect the environment from agricultural pesticide releases at bulk storage sites and fromagricult ural spills and leaks resulting from pesticide refilling and dispensing (repackaging, mixing and loading) operations. Pesticide Technical Information Collection and Dissemination A listing of pesticide sensitive individuals was first compiled in 1989. During 2010, this section registered 163 individuals. These individuals receive advance notification of pesticideapplications made to adjacent properties by commercial ornamental plant and turf pest control businesses and publicagencies. A mailing was se nt to all commercial companies and public agencies licensed or permitted in the ornamental plant and turf pest control category. Searchable databases of registered pesticide products, licensedpesticide businesses, commercial and private applicators and pesticide dealers continue to be posted on the MDA 's web site.These databases provide information to applicators and the public about pesticides that may legally be sold, distributed or used in Maryland and the names and addresses of licensedpesticide businesses. Pesticide dealers can check the certification status of pesticide applicators prior to selling them restricted use pesticides. This database is linked to EPA 's registrationdatabase so that information on each pesticide product queried, such as the EPA registration number, pest controlled, site of application, formulation active ingredient and thebrand name can be obtained. Integrated Pest Management in Schools The section continues to promote and support implementation ofthe I ntegrated Pest Management (IPM) Program in Public Schools. Regulations that require schools to develop and implement notification and IPM plans for indoor pest controlbecame effective in 1999, and regulations for notification andlPM plans for school grounds became effective in 2002. Staffprovided technical assistance in the development of the plansand dist ribution of information on potential adverse effects of pesticides applied. The PRS staff continues to work withMaryland P ublic Sc hool districts on implementation of IPM on school property. In addition, PRS staff members serve as members of the Northeast Region IPM Center's School IPM Working G roup,the N ortheast Region's K-12 IPM Curriculum Subcommittee, and the Association of Structural Pest Control Regulatory Official's IPM in School Committee. PRS staff continues to work with the Maryland Public School district's on the use and implementation of IPM on school property. During 2010, MDA hosted a meeting for school personnel and their pest control contractors. T opics for the meeting includeddiscussio ns on compliance, health related issues involving pest control, bat control and IPM education for students and staff. Training Events During 2010, the PRS inspectors and enforcement program coordinator attended the annual EPA Region III State PesticideInspector's Workshop hosted by the West Virginia Department of Agriculture. Sixty-two inspectors from Maryland, Delaware, Pennsylvania, Washington D.C., Virginia and West Virginiawere in attendance. The agenda for the workshop included health and safety training for the inspectors as well as presen- tations on the importance of personal protective equipment(PPE) to prevent pesticide exposures, conducting inspections 47| Office of Plant Industries and Pest Management |at pesticide producing establishments and market places where pesticides are sold, pesticide label interpretation, concerns and challenges of invasive species control, investigating fish kills along with respirator fit testing. Also included in the workshop was a field trip to the Sarbanes Ecological Science Center where a mock investigation exercise of a bird kill took place. Special Programs During 2010, the section offered its recycling program for empty plastic pesticide containers to growers and commercial pesticide applicators at 20 locations. Collection centers weremaintained in seven counties (Frederick, Harford, Kent, Prince George's, Talbot, Washington and Wicomico) with the assistance of county government agencies. A total of 128 collection days were held from June through September. In addition, 13pesticide dealer/custom applicators participated in inspectionand collection of containers at their own facilities. A total of41,000 containers weighing 20 tons, were collected from 130participants. The containers were processed for transporting to a plastic recycling facility. The Maryland Department of Agriculture's Pesticide Regulation Section staff continued to offer outreach and assistanc e to growers and pesticide dealers under the Worker Protection Program. The Worker Protection Standard (WPS) was estab lished to minimize occupational exposure to agricultural pesticides. The WPS requires agricultural workers,who could be exposed to pesticides, to receive training on pesticide saf ety. Brochures on the WPS have been produced and widely distributed to the regulated community. T o aid with on-farm compliance, the section has developed a pocket- sized WPS Compliance Evaluation Checklist which is available to all of the WPS regulated community. The section also contracted with T elamon Corporation to provide pesticidesafety training to farm worker. In 2010, T elamon members provided training in Spanish to 590 farm workers and 38 non-farm workers (health care providers). T elamon also provided pesticide safety and awareness training to 142 childr en offarm w orkers, from pre-K through eighth grade. 48| Office of Plant Industries and Pest Management | VGoal: T o utilize proper pesticide management in order to reduce the potential adverse impacts ofpesticides on human health, environmental resources and agricultural commodities.

Regulation is accomplished by product registration, laboratoryanalysis, inspection, and voluntary compliance and enforce- ment actions such as stop sale orders. The section is totally fee-supported. Registration of Pr oducts Pesticide products, commercial feeds, fertilizers, fertilizer/ pesticides, liming materials, and soil conditioners are registered for sale or distribution only after careful review of the label to determine the material's nature, proposed uses and potential adverse impacts on agriculture, the environment, thegeneral public, and the regulated industry. During CY2010 15,653 commercial feeds. See Table 1 for details and comparisons to product registrations of prior years. Inspection Field inspectors routinely sample products that are randomly selected at retail outlets, distribution centers, warehouses, andformulating facilities. These inspections enable the section to maintain e fficie nt regulatory control that ensures the sale, distribution and use of effective products that are safe for the consumer and environment, when used in accordance with approved label instructions. The inspectors sample a represen- tative cross section of products for chemical analysis andobtain r eliable data on the distribution, formulation and sale of these commodities. This enables the section to stop the sale o r distribution of ineffective products or those that are harmful to humans, animals or the environment because ofunacceptable levels of pesticides, plant nutrients, trace elements and/or toxic materials. In CY2010, section inspectors performed approximately 1,091 on-site inspections. See Table 2 Inspection Program.Laboratory Analyses/Investigations The Maryland Department of Agriculture's (MDA) state of the science laboratory is staffed with chemists who have expertise and experience in the use of highly sophisticated computercontrolled instruments used for the analysis of agricultural chemicals and toxic contaminants in commercial products, crops and environmental samples (water, soil, fish, etc.). Thelaboratory staff provides reliable scientific data that are used to assist farmers and to initiate or support regulatory actions against violative products or violators of state and federal agricultural and environmental laws. The laboratory also provides support to the Maryland departments of the Environment and Natural Resources, to the U.S, Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the U. S. EnvironmentalProtection Agency (EPA). Homeland Security FERN (Food Emergency Response Network) for Chemistry MDA's Stat e Chemist Section's laboratory is the primary Food Emergency Response Network (FERN) chemistry laboratory for the State of Maryland. It is an essential part of a nationalFederal-State network that is expected to be in a state ofreadiness for quick response to a chemical terrorist attack onState and/o r nat ional human and animal food supplies. In the event of such an attack, the Section's laboratory staff would be expected to provide rapid and reliable analysis of food, feed, crops and wat er samples t o determine if such items would be embargoed or released for human and animal consumption. The laboratory is an active participant in a federal/state laboratory proficiency program for the analysis of highly toxicmaterials in food and water. In 2010, the section participated in 10 studies conducted by FERN for the analysis of melaminein food. Since 2005, MDA 's Maryland State Chemist laboratory has participat ed in 11 FDA/USDA/FERN collaborative check sample analysis studies involving highly toxic materials\u2014three of which are among the most deadly known natural toxinsand two among the most deadly man made toxic chemicals. The laboratory was successful in identifying these toxic materials in the collaborative check samples. The toxins/chemicals inc lude hea melamine, sodium fluroacetate, and pesticides. 50| Office of Plant Industries and Pest Management | State Chemist SectionAmmonium Nitrate (Potential Explosive for T errorist Activities) The section inspection staff inspects fertilizer manufacturers and warehouses twice a year to determine amounts of ammonium nitrate stored and that monitoring of sales and distributionrecords are maintained in accordance with federal/state law. Enforcement Any regulated product determined to be ineffective, misbranded or deleterious to the public, agriculture, or the environment is removed from the market place. Determination for productremoval is based on inspection, laboratory analysis of officialsamples, information received from federal or state regulatory agencies, products offered for sale but not registered for use or distribution in Maryland, and review of labels or other materials s ubmitted by companies to support product regis- tration. See Table 3 for details relating to stop sale orders. Human and Animal Health Activities Mycotoxin Contamination MDA continues to monitor Maryland and imported grain products (livestock feed) for the specific mycotoxin known as vomitoxin. The Maryland State Chemist Section will continue this mo nitoring unt il the re is e vidence that stored contaminated grain from 2009 has been depleted and no longer poses a mycotoxin contamination threat of livestock feed. The insp ection staff and laboratory have also assisted the farm community in ascertaining the levels of aflatoxin, nitrates and prussic acid in silage and feed resulting from drought to prevent livestock death or illness. Protein Adulteration Surveillance\u2014Melamine The section continues its monitoring activities for protein adulteration in pet foods by analyzing them for melamine.Since the pet food crisis in 2008, which resulted in many deaths of cats and dogs, and the hospitalization of many othe rs,the se ction continues to monitor wet, moist and canned pet foods for melamine by an ELISA technique. If any pet foods are found to be over 10 ppm (part per million) they are confirmed by a second technique, HPLC- MS/MS. The section analyzed 58 samples in CY2010 for the presence of melamine. All samples were found to be negativefor melamine.Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE-Mad Cow Disease) The section continued an inspection program in conjunction with FDA that began in 1999 to determine if feed mills, retail and wholesale distributors, haulers and grain storage facilitieswithin Maryland comply with FDA regulations pertaining to the prevention of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), also known as Mad Cow Disease. Feed mills and/or feed dis-tributors are issued stop sale orders for products determined to be not in compliance with state and FDA regulations. In 2010, the section completed 54 BSE inspections and collected 74 samples from feed mills, various retail and wholesale distributors,grain haulers/storage facilities and pet food manufacturers. All facilities that were inspected during the contract period were found t o be in compliance and void of any violations of the FDA regulations pertaining to BSE. All samples were analyzed by PCR (polymerase chain reaction) to determine the presence of bovine tissue\u2014via DNA replica-tion. Twelve samples contained bovine tissue and the resultswere reported to FDA. Recent terrorist activities have resulted in placing additional emphasis o n section inspection activities that go beyond the protocols established by the FDA. Section inspectors distributed hand outs that list sp ecific precautions that farmers, retailers, distributors and warehouses should follow to help ensure that ruminant animal feed manufactured or distributedin M aryland does not contain ingredients that may transmit BSE. The insp ectors have been instructed to personally emphasize to mill workers, distributors, etc. the need to read, understand and f ollow the specific precautions that appear on the war ning hand outs. The economic havoc that would ensue from animal feed containing BSE transmissible ingredients inadvertently or deliberately fed to the ruminant farm animal populations could be ruinous to the beef industry and allied businesses(e.g., fast food companies, food stores, restaurants, etc). Beyond the economic considerations, public health concernswould b e even greater because ingestion by humans of BSE-contaminated meat could result in incurable fatal brain cell degeneration. 51| Office of Plant Industries and Pest Management |Antiterrorism and Homeland Security Issues Because of the nature of the duties and capabilities of the section, many of the activities reported elsewhere in this document have homeland security implications. Specific mention has been made of the section's BSE and FERN activities. In addition, the section cooperates with theDepartment of Health and Mental Hygiene, Laboratories Administration, the State Police, the Maryland Department of the Environment and all of the local health departmentsthrough its position on the Laboratory Emergency Preparedness Advisory Committee. As noted above, the section has inspectors routinely inspecting establishments distributing fertilizer. A part of the inspection protocol involves reviewing the measures that the establishment uses t o assure that fertilizer ingredients are not diverted to illegal uses. Protocols that are recommended at these inspec- tions are those that have been developed in cooperation with the federal government, other states and industry groups. USDA\u2014Pesticide Data Program (PDP) Since 1997, the USDA has contracted with the section to sample v arious f ood items from principal distribution centers in the stat e. These samples consist of such diverse items as pineapples, potatoes, processed food, processed fruit juices,produce,milk, and peanut butter which are analyzed by federal and state laboratories for several hundred different pesticides. In concert with the EPA Food Safety Program, thedata will be used to establish new pesticide food toleranceswith added emphasis on the diet of infants and children. SeeTable 2. USDA - Microbiological Data Program (MDP) Since 2001, the section has been contracted by USDA to sample various produce items from principal food distribution centersfor anal ysis to determine the presence of specific pathogens relative to a national health concern about food-borne bacteria. Raw agricultural food commodities were collected by sectioninspectors to be analyzed for E.coli ,Salmonella sp. and Listeria monocy togenes.These anal yses ar e being c onducted by various federal and state contract microbiological laboratories. See Table 2. Food Safety Survey of Maryland Produce Since 1992, the se ction collected from roadside vegetable/fruit stands random samples of Maryland grown produce which were then tested for 400 different pesticides. The data will be sent to EPA and USDA for incorporation into national databanks. The section has performed this survey for 19 years and is pleased to report that the surveys indicated that Marylandgrown produce does not contain any toxic levels of pesticides.Drugs and Additives in Livestock Feed In order to help ensure the safe and effective use of drugs in livestock feed, the section has expanded its feed analysis program. Any feed products containing drugs that do not meet the federal requirements relative to use, over-formulation or deficiency are removed from the market place. Removal of volatile products not only protects farm livestock but also provides protection to the public against exposure to drug resistant bacteria. In 2010, the section analyzed 120 samples of feed for 12 different drugs. Distributors and registrants of defective feed products were notified and either stop sale orders or warnings of potential regulatory action were issuedto remove unacceptable products from the marketplace. Inaddition to monitoring animal feed for drugs and phytase, the section randomly samples and screens the ingredients that areused in the production of feed for pesticides and heavy metals. Environment Commercial Fertilizer Regulation Since the early 1990's, the Maryland State Chemist Section saw the need to mitigate the leaching of commercial fertilizernutrients into tributaries of the Chesapeake Bay. The section issues Stop Sale Orders and Warnings to registrants of products that are over formulated with either nitrogen and/or phosp horus compounds. The section was criticized by various segments of the regulated industry at the time MDA inaugurated this policy. Maryland was the first to implementthis regulatory policy. Commercial Fertilizer Distribution State/County MDA 's State Chemist Section continues to monitor (tabulate) the amount of commercial fertilizer distributed/sold in the State. Table 6 lists the individual amounts of farm and non- farm fertilizer by tonnage. The section also requires the amountofcommercial fertilizer distributed/sold in each county. Compost Facility Operator Certification The Maryland Commercial Compost Law requires the presence ofan MD A certified facility operator responsible for overseeing the manufacturing process from beginning to end. Examinations on the manufacturing of commercial compost are administeredto those individuals required to become certified as compost facility operators. Fifteen people took the exam during 2010. Additionally, those individuals passing the exam are requiredto fulfil l specific c ontinuing education requirements in order to maintain their certification. This involves attending training courses ap proved by the Maryland State Chemist as well as participating in facility inspections conducted by State Chemist inspectors. 52| Office of Plant Industries and Pest Management |53| Office of Plant Industries and Pest Management | VGoal: T o ensure the sale and distribution of safe, effective and environmentally acceptable products intended to (1) protect and promote agriculture, (2) control or eliminate pathogenic microorganisms and other pests in homes andpublic facilities, (3) protect forest and horticultural crops, (4) provide nutritiously balanced and safe livestock feed and pet food.

Fertilizer Sale/Distribution\u2014Tons the single most important input to any agricultural system. T o be successful, the grower, whether a farmertilling hundreds of acres or a homeowner with a garden, must begin with quality seed. The Turf and Seed Section conducts regulatory and service programs, including seed and field inspections, testing, certification and quality control services, which are designed to insure the continued availability of high quality seed to Maryland's seed consumers. T oday's seed industry exists in an environment of rapid change. The continued development of biotechnology and the expansion of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) has had an enormous effect on the production, distribution and marketing of seedand upon state seed programs. Seed regulatory, testing and certification programs throughout the country are being challenged to meet the demands brought about by these changes in seed technology. Seed Laboratory The Maryland Department of Agriculture's (MDA) seed testing laboratory is central to the operation of the section,supporting the regulatory, certification, supervised seed mixing and turfgrass activities, while also providing service testing for seed producers, dealers, farmers and other seed consumers. Turfgrass professionals depend upon the laboratory to provide them with purity, germination and noxious weed seed examinations on seed lots destined for use on golf courses, sodproduction fields, public grounds and other areas demanding high quality turf. Commercial vegetable growers utilize the laboratory for specialized vigor and germination testing,particular ly for peas, garden beans and lima beans. The StateHighway Administration relies upon the laboratory to test all grass, wildflower, shrub and other seed planted alongMaryland's highways. Maryland farmers participating in the Maryland Agricultural Water Quality Cost-Share (MACS) cover crop program utilize the laboratory to ensure that theseed they plant meets the quality standards required for that program. The laboratory also identifies seed submitted by farmers, veterinarians, health officials, other government agencies and the general public. Round-up\u00ae Ready testing of seeds is conducted by the laboratory for authorized seed producers to assist with their quality control programs.The laboratory also tests seeds used on wetland mitigation, restoration and conservation projects. Key to a successful laboratory operation is a well-trained staff. The Association of Official Seed Analysts (AOSA) maintains an accreditation program for seed analysts in official laboratories throughout the U nited Stat es.Analysts who pass rigorous tests, which include both written and practical examinations, are certified as official purity and germination analysts. At thepresent time, six MDA staff members are certified by AOSA inboth purity and germination testing, out of a nationwide totalof 105 analysts who have achieved this level of certification.The lab oratory staff also routinely participates in various seed referee tests. These referees develop new testing methodology and ensure uniform and accurate seed testing throughout thecount ry,while also serving as continuing education requirements necessary for certified analysts to maintain their credentials. Seed Regulator y The Maryland Seed Law requires that all seed offered for sale in the stat e must b e accurately labeled. This includes agricult ural, vegetable, flower, lawn and turf seed, as well as specialized seed such as seeds of trees, shrubs, native species, wildflowers and seed used in reclamation and wetlands mitigation and conservation projects. This seed is sold in quantities ranging from small packets of vegetable and flower seed sold to home gardeners to bulk sales of thousands ofpounds o fcrop seed sold to farmers. All seed distributed in Maryland is subject to inspection by this section. For much of its seed needs, Maryland relies on other areas of the country and the world where climates are more suited toseed production. Thus, it is important that Maryland maintain a strong and effective regulatory program. Seed importing states that fail to maintain good seed regulatory programsbecome \"dumping grounds\" for low quality seed that is not acceptable to be sold in many other states.| Office of Plant Industries and Pest Management | Turf and Seed Turf and Seed Section staff germinate seed such as this to determine that it meets standards.59Turf and Seed Activities, 2008-2010 2008 2009 2010 Field Inspections Acres of Turf Inspected 7,140 9,272 5,895 Acres of Crop Seed Inspected 13,066 11,447 9,904 Supervised Mixing Pounds of Seed Mixed (thousand) 1,446 979 1,337 Retail and Wholesale Seed Inspections Number of Lots Sampled 917 890 1,014 Number of Regulatory Seed T ests Conducted 3,243 2,965 3,145 Seed Testing Purity Service Germination Service T ests Conducted 5,230 5,352 4,535| Office of Plant Industries and Pest Management | Maryland' s seed inspectors visit both retail and wholesale seed dealers throughout the state. They review label claims, ensure that germination test dates are current and look for seed lots that ha ve been found t o be mislabeled or otherwise illegal for sale based on samples taken at other locations. Seed lots are sampled and submitted to the laboratory for testing. Lotsfound in violation of the Maryland Seed Law are placed undera stop sale order until they are brought into compliance.Corrective action may include re-labeling, reconditioning,destruction of the seed lot or its removal from the state. Seed dealers who fail to comply with a stop sale order are subject to civil penalties. Seed Certification The seed certification program is adapting to changes in the seed business. As biotechnology increases in agricultural crops,movement away from traditional certification services is occurring. More and more seed varieties are being developed by large investments in biotech research by private companies.The in volvement of public institutions, which in the past were the source for most certified seed varieties, continues to decline. With the increased number of crop varieties being released by private companies, the demand for quality assuranceinspections by third parties is strong, particularly from smallto me dium-siz ed seed companies that cannot afford their own quality control programs. Companies growing seed in Maryland lo ok to this se ction for expertise in field inspections, sampling and lab oratory analysis for quality control of their products. In the future, it is anticipated that quality control inspection acreage will increase as certified acreage decreases. Staff members worked closely with seed growers and conditionersto assist them in producing a product that meets some of the highest quality standards in the United States. Maryland seedsmenhave become a net exporter of wheat, barley, and soybean seed, adding much revenue to the Maryland agriculture economy. Staff members cooperated with the Maryland Crop Improvement Association, the Maryland Agricultural Experiment Stations,and the U niversity of Maryland in the production and distri- bution of Maryland Foundation seed. Much effort was spent to maintain the g enetic purity of foundation seed of public varieties important to Maryland agriculture. This foundation seed was distributed to the Maryland seedsmen for the production of Maryland certified seed. Vegetables like this cabbage planted Baltimore City Hall highlight a growing interest in backyard gardens and need for quality seed.Super vised Seed Mixing The supervised seed mixing system enables certification to be continued when certified lots of different kinds and varieties of seeds are mixed together. Demand from the industry andconsumers for supervised seed mixing is strong. The supervisedseed mixing program's oversight ensures that the consumerreceives quality seed by precluding the opportunity for substi-tution of varieties or seed lots that have not been approved. All seed used on State Highway Administration projects and the seed used for the production of Maryland certified turfgrasssod is mixed under this program. Many county and local gov- ernments, school systems, golf courses, recreation departments and professional seeding contractors also require that the seedthey pur chase b e mix ed under this program. Prior to mixing ,component seed lots must be officially sampled and tested by the Maryland State Seed Laboratory. Seed lots that me et applicab le standards are then mixed under the direct supervision of an MDA inspector who ensures that the mixer is free of any contaminants and that only approved seed lots are used in the mixture. Special tags are sewn onto each bag toverify that the seed was mixed under MDA supervision.Turf Regulator y Maryland' s Turfgrass Law requires that all turfgrass sod, plugs and sprigs be accurately labeled. Due to the overall high quality of sod produced by Maryland sod growers, staff effortsare usually limited to responding to complaints which arepromptly investigated and resolved. In the majority of cases,the problems are determined to be due to site preparation andother growing conditions rather than the quality or condition of the sod. The Maryland public continues to be able to purchase some of the highest quality sod available anywhere. Turf Certification Maryland's turf certification program is a leader in the nation and has served as a model for certification programs in otherstates. Growers must plant varieties recommended by the University of Maryland based on performance trials conductedin this region. All seed used in this program is tested by the Maryland State Seed Laboratory and mixed under the supervi- sion of MDA inspectors, and all certified turfgrass fields areinspected for quality before harvest. Many sod specifications require Maryland certified turfgrass as a means of assuring the use o f high quality varieties that are well adapted to this area. 60| Office of Plant Industries and Pest Management | Harvest of soybeans grown on the Eastern Shore.Customer Service Providing good customer service is a priority of the Turf and Seed section, and is one of the objectives measured by the section's Managing for Results (MFR) data. Staff strive to provideresults in a timely manner to those customers submitting service requests. Due to the fact that the marketing and planting of seed is time-sensitive and is impacted by weather conditions,our customers rely on MDA staff to provide inspections, schedule supervised mixes, and send out seed test results rapidly to enable their businesses to remain successful in the seedmarket. The mission of the Turf and Seed section is to provide the seed and turfgrass industries and consumers of Maryland with regulatory testing and certification programs that encouragethe production and use of high quality seed and turfgrass and that insure an orderly marketplace. Our vision is to achieve excellence in seed testing, field inspection, certification andregulat ory activities, utilizing a staff of knowledgeable and dedicated professionals to assist the industry and consumers of Maryland in the production and use of superior quality seedand turfgrass. Factors Af fecting T urf and Seed Activities The numbers of acres of turf and crop seed inspected, as well as the n umb er ofpounds o fseed mixed, have all been impact- ed by economic c onditions. The downturn in the building and construction industries has affected the Turf and Seed section's revenue due to a temporary decrease in demand for seed mixes used on highway and building projects, and for the seeding of turfgrass sod used on construction sites. 61| Office of Plant Industries and Pest Management | VGoal: Ensure that seed offered for sale is accurately labeled and in compliance with Maryland Seed Law inorder that the citizens of Maryland may rely on the accuracy of the labeling and thus be assured they are purchasing the quality of seed they desire. VObjective: Ensure that 90 percent of seed lots offered for sale in Maryland are labeled correctly. Performance Measures 2010 Actual Outcome: Percent of seed lots found 89.2 to be correctly labeled VGoal: T o ensure that service samples of seed submitted to the laboratory are completed in a timely manner. VObjective: Ensure that all service purity analyses will be completed, on average, within three days of receiptof seed sample and all service samples submitted forgermination testing will have been planted, on aver- age, within three days of sample receipt. Performance Measures 2010 Actual Quality: Average number of days 8.8 between receipt of service sample andcomple tion of purity analysis Quality: Average number of days 1.7 between receipt of service sample and plant ing f or germination tests Detection and Evaluation Surveys Bark Beetles \u2014In cooperation with the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Maryland Department of Agriculture (MDA), Plant Protection and Weed Management Section hasoperated an insect trapping network for the pine shoot beetle ( Tomicus piniperda ) for the past decade. Based on 2010 results, this introduced pest of Pinus from Europe has newly beendetected in Baltimore, Carroll, Harford, and Howard counties, which now join Garrett, Allegany, Washington, Frederick, and Montgomery counties under state and federal quarantines forpine shoot beetle. Since the initial U.S. detection in Ohio in 1992, this small bark beetle now occurs in 17 states including Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Virginia. The pine shoot beetle, a European bark beetle, was targeted in 2010 by USDAAPHIS funded survey conducted in 15 Maryland counties.There were 51 trap sites of which 19 were positive. The pineshoot beetle was first found in western Maryland in 1995.Pine shoot beetles are commonly found in the four westernMaryland c ount ies (A llegany, Frederick, Garrett and Washingt on). Southern pine beetle \u2014Since 1989, Maryland has participated in a multi-state SPB survey throughout the southern UnitedStates using pheromone-baited traps. Trap data indicated thatSPB numbers would continue to remain low in 2010, but populations usually build up to damaging levels on a 7-8 yearcycle. Populations have been below outbreak level since 1994. Three sites were detected in 2010\u2014two sites in Kent County, a first for this county for 34 acres, and one site in TalbotCounty. The 2010 Forest Damage Map does not have theTalbot County site as it was just recently confirmed. Gypsy Moth \u2014Egg mass surveys conducted in the fall of 2009 indicat ed damag ing inf estation levels in one county. In the spring of 2010, 144 acres were treated in the eastern shore areas of the state in Talbot County. Maryland experienced zero acres of defoliation. Surveys so far indicate that treatments will not needed on in 2011.The map below depicts all of the survey areas MDA plans to survey. However, man power restraints do not make this possible on a yearly basis. The plan is to survey each area atleast once every four years. Sirex noctillio \u2014MDA, Plant Protection and Weed Management Section placed 80 traps in 8 counties with no positives. Emerald Ash Borer \u2014MDA, Plant Protection and Weed Manag ementSection and the Forest Pest Management Section placed 2,600 purple traps in 21 counties and the City of Baltimore. There were 33 positive traps all within thequarantined areas of Charles and Prince George's counties. Hardwood Defoliators and other damage causing agents \u2014 In addition to gypsy moth caused damage the Beech Bark Disease, and roadside salt and chemicals caused damage to Maryland's forests. 62| Office of Plant Industries and Pest Management | Forest Pest Management Delimiting Sur veys and Mapping Aerial surveys were conducted to determine the extent of forest pest damage, especially by the gypsy moth. Over the course of this latest gypsy moth outbreak (2007-2010) gypsy moth defoliation totaled 88,036 acres and g ypsy moth mo rtality totaled 11,084 acres. 63| Office of Plant Industries and Pest Management | 2010 Gypsy Moth-Caused Host Mor tality fr om 2008 Gypsy Moth Defoliation Region # Defoliated Acres Surveyed # Survey Points #Dead Board Feet # Dead Cords Eastern Maryland 141 3 58,797 \u2014 Northeastern Maryland 300 11 581,410 190 Central Maryland 7,219 133 4,931,196 4,540 Western Maryland 88 15,648 240 7,524,894 10,146 Hemlock Monitoring Hemlock W oolly Adelgid (HW A) \u2014HWA remains the major threat to the health of eastern hemlock. Infested hemlocks occur in the metropolitan area between Baltimore andWashington and in natural stands from Harford to Garrett counties. As part of a mid-Atlantic multi-state survey, 13 plots have been set up in six counties to assess the HWA impact onhemlock stands. Comparing 1998 plot data and 2009-2010 plot data, the number of hemlocks with a vigor rating of healthy decreased 96 percent and the number of hemlocks still alive decreased by 24 percent. The potential for HWA biological control by the predatory beetle Laricobius nigrinus was evaluated in Frederick City watershed and in Rocky Gap State Park in Allegany County during 2004. Laricobius was recovered from Rocky Gap in the fall of 2005. Recoveries since then indicate that the beetle is now established at that site.Additional releases have been made at Rocky Gap in an effort to establish a field insectary so that beetles can be harvested for movement to other areas. In 2010, 200 beetles were collected from Rocky Gap and released at Savage River State Forest. The predatory beetle, Laricobius nigrinus , was recovered from Rocky Gap in 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2009. The beetle release site in the Rocky Gap gorge has been declared an established population after recoveries in 2007. The beetles have also been recovered froma release sit e at the F redrick City watershed. More beetle releases w ere made in 2007 at Rocky Gap, Hagerstown watershed, Pretty Boy Reservoir and Broad Creek Boy Scout Camp. In 2008, additional L. nigrinus releases were made at Rocky Gap, Broad Creek, Savage River State Forest, FrederickCity watershed and Potomac State Forest. In 2009, additional L. nigrinus releases were made at Rocky Gap. In 2010, additional releases were made at Laurel Run, Dry Run, Lostland Run, Big Run, Rocky Gap, Prettyboy Reservoir andBroad Creek. Since 2003, 11,943 L.nigrinus have been released in Maryland. Two other predatory beetle species, Scymnus sinuanodulus and Sasajiscymnus tsugae were released at several different sites, with no recoveries made.Hemlock Woolly Adelgid Suppression A joint MD A-DNR he mlock woolly adelgid (HWA) Task Force addressed the multidisciplinary needs of the HWA infestation. More than 50 hemlock stands were prioritized. The top 50 prioritized stands were selected as the sites where suppressionmight be attempted. Only publicly-owned sites would be partof this suppression project. So far in 2010, 3,771 hemlockshave had soil injection treatments for a total of 7,478 soil injection trees since 2005 more than doubling the number in one year. So far in 2010, 724 trees have been trunk injected fora total o f1,309 t rees since 2004 also more than doubling the numb er in one year. The HWAS soil treatments decreased HWA populations by 44 percent while the control hemlocks' HWA population increased by 34 percent. This year MDAstarted to survey all 50 top priority sites for the HWA. 64| Office of Plant Industries and Pest Management | 65| Office of Plant Industries and Pest Management | Hemlock Woolly Adelgid Suppression with Imidacloprid in Maryland CY2010 Treatment # Trees DBH (inches) Soil Injection 3,771 34,563 Trunk Injection 724 8,534 Total 4,495 43,097 Hemlock Woolly Adelgid Suppression with Imidacloprid in Maryland 2004-2010 Treatment # Trees DBH (inches) Soil Injection 1,309 16,719 Total 8,787 88,935 VGoal: T o prevent economic losses to forest and land- scape trees due to insect pests and diseases.

One tool that shows promise is therelease of biological control agents originating from the pest's country of origin that seek out and destroy their target. Since the release permit was approved by the USDA Animaland Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) in 2009, more than 38,700 parasitoids, one egg and two larval, have been released. Subsequent recovery of all three agents in thespring of 2010 indicates that they will overwinter in Maryland. Establishment will be confirmed if they are recovered in 2011. Native parasitoids are also being recovered at low levels indicating that over time they may also target to this new host. Continued releases andevaluation are planned. VFamous and H istoric Tree Program: Althoug h the majo rity ofMaryland-produced trees and shrubs are of high quality, nurseries and plant dealers in the State still face major challenges in the hig hly competitive retail sales market. Almost every new variety or cultivar that shows sales strength is quickly over-supplied in the marketplace,driving prices down. In addition, there are many skilledpersonnel in large commercial nurseries throughout thecountry who are able to produce identical items for pricesthat a smal l mid-A tlantic facility cannot match. One way to ensure Maryland growers receive top prices is to develop a \"value-added\" product that adds a distinction difficult or impossible for competitors to match. This concept isproducing promising results for an array of agriculturalcommo dities. VIn 2010, a central Maryland wholesale nursery teamed with an international forestry organization to produce a collection of ornamental and forest tree seedlings using a unique but clever value-added feature. All seedlings in the mail order catalogue have a connection to an historical event, site, or person in the United States. For example, the George Washington tulip poplar tree was produced fromseed gathered from a tree Washington planted himself in 1785 on his Mount Vernon estate. The Angel oak seedling is produced from acorns collected from a tree on John's Island, S.C. that is over 1,400 years old and thought to be the oldest living organism east of the Mississippi River. Tree species associated with James Madison, Abraham Lincoln,Robert E.Lee,Martin Luther King, Clara Barton, and Mark Twain are also offered. The Survivor elm selection isproduced from seed from a single American elm tree that withstood the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing attack thatkilled and injured hundreds. Initial year-end sales totals showed the two most popular trees sold through the program were the Washington, D.C. Tidal Basin cherry and theJohnny Appleseed apple. The historical connection of this plant material cannot be matched by outside competitors. VThe Plant Protection and Weed Management Section provided guidance and services to this nursery in the vitalareas of interstate shipping and adherence to exterior plant quarantine regulations. A domestic shipping matrix was developed, outlining all applicable plant quarantines andidentifing prohibited species. Pesticide treatments were recommended and witnessed on a monthly basis. Agricultural officials in other states were personally contacted and several agreements were formulated that resulted in market expansio n and incr eased sales o pportunities for the Maryland nursery. Monthly inspections to issue certificates were conducted throughout the year. Other modificationsto tree production methods at the nursery can lead to further interstate sales. In 2011, MDA will supervise thedestruction of volunteer Prunus within a one-mile radius ofthe nursery so that cherry selections can be shipped into the State of California. The Plant Protection and Weed Management Section recognizes the inherent benefits of asuccessful n ursery industry in the State and is uniquely positioned to provide vital services in the production of \"value-added\" plant material. VPine S hoot Beetle Quarantine: The pine shoot beetle, expanded its damage and its range within Maryland in 2010. Four Maryland counties were found to be newly positive for pine shoot beetle in 2010: Carroll, Baltimore,Harford and Howard. Because of the significant and rather sudden increase in range expansion, the number of growers under federal quarantine regulations also rose significantly.MDA staff acted quickly to distribute information to the nursery industry and to the cut Christmas tree growers regarding the quarantine regulations and took necessary actions to limit spread of the beetle both intra- and interstate. A website was established to inform the public about the pine shoot beetle program in Maryland,www .mda.stat e.md.us/plants-p ests/psb .php. 66| Office of Plant Industries and Pest Management | Plant Protection and Weed Management Apiar y Inspection The primary purpose of this program is to control honey bee diseases, mites,and p ests, in order to maintain healthy bees for the essential pollination of Maryland crops. Honey bees are responsible for the pollination of crops valued at more than$40 million. Maryland growers of fruit and vegetable cropsannually rent approximately 5,000 colonies to improve polli-nation. Beekeepers' colonies are essential to Maryland becausetwo par asitic mites have nearly eliminated feral colonies. American foulbrood is the most serious brood disease of honey bees and can destroy a colony in one year. The 22 colonies that inspectors found to have American foulbrood were destroyed to control the spread of this bacterial disease tohealthy colonies. The incidence of disease remains relatively low\u2014less than one percent of colonies inspected. Varroa and tracheal mite populations were very low in Maryland in 2010, but brood problems were attributed to varroa mite in the season. The varroa mite often has been found to be resistant to Apistan\u00ae, the primary product used to control this parasite. Four additional products are nowavailab le to control varroa. Africaniz ed honey bees arrive occasionally on cargo ships coming fr om South or Central America. Swarm traps for collecting and monitoring bees were placed at 35 sites at marine terminals and other shipping locations. No swarms were collected in 2010. MDA is working with two groups\u2014the Mid-Atlantic Apiculture Research and Extension Consortium(MAAREC) to provide information to the general public about emergency incidents, and the Apiary Inspectors ofAmerica (AIA) for information on the control of movement, other than through natural spread. The small hive beetle was detected in packaged bees and reported or detected in 21 counties this past year. Colonies are treated and monitored to ensure successful control of the beetles. There have been reports of larvae damage to established colonies. The small hive beetle is a pest mainly in storedequipment and in honey houses, although it can render stored honey in the hive unmarketable. Permits were issued for 3,315 honey bee colonies to move out of Maryland and 897 colonies to move into Maryland forpollination services. For the fifth year, Maryland beekeepers will send c olonies t o California for almond pollination. In December, 2,000 colonies were transported to California for this purpose, to return to Maryland in March of 2011. 67| Office of Plant Industries and Pest Management | VGoal: T o successfully safeguard the plant health and quality of plant resources in Maryland. VObjective: Continue to provide inspections and laboratory testing that ensure at least 97 percent ofplant lots meet plant certification standards and enhance the reputation and quality of plants produced in Maryland. Performance Measures 2010 Actual Outcome: Percent of plant lots meeting 95 certification standards Average number of days between 5request for certification and scheduled inspection and issuance of certificates VObjective: Continue to ensure Maryland honey bee colonies are free of disease, meet interstate certification requirements and are in sufficient supply to meet pollinat ion ne eds of crops valued at more than $40 million per year in Maryland.

Federally funded surveys included exotic wood borers, exotic grape pests, imported fire ant, giant hogweed, noxious weed/Khapra beetle, pine shoot beetle, emerald ash borer,and Sirex noctilio . Outreach and education is an important component of our activities. A total of 5,859 insect traps were deployed and monitored in 2010. Through the various types of surveys conducted, 20,536 samples were collected. Trapping techniques involved a wide range of devices, including purple prism and Lindgren funneltraps. Pheromones, food baiting and host volatile attractants are all employed for specific pests. The surveys target pests that are exotic to Maryland. Nine extensive surveys targeting 25 exotic pests that impact trees,stored products, field, fruit and vegetable crops, nursery stock,and nat ural areas were conducted. MDA conducted exotic wood borer surveys in six counties and 15 sites and for exotic field and vegetable pests at 25 vineyards in 11 counties in2010. No targ et pests were detected. A few pests, such as the e merald ash borer and imported fire ant required responses. With the loss of the pheromone and blacklight trap program for monitoring endemic agronomic pests, MD growers were unaware of unusually high corn earworm and fall armyworm activity, resulting in costly losseson vegetable crops such as sweet corn. The red imported fire ant ,Solenopsis invicta , a South American stinging insect, is occasionally shipped out of thesouthern United States, in spite of a federal domestic quarantinethat prohibits movement of a variety of commodities unlesstreated and/o r certified free of fire ants. This insect's ability to quickly colonize in a variety of habitats, and its aggressive foraging behavior, pose additional dangers if established in Maryland. Thirty-three isolated infestations have been eradi- cated in Maryland since 1989. Efforts in the spring to inspect trucks transporting tropical foliage plants from the quarantinedareas in the southern United States, work closely with officials in those states, and the brokers and recipients in Maryland, as well as survey and eradication efforts have had a positiveimpa ct on the incur sion of fire ant. Ninety four surveys in seven counties and Baltimore City at 84 sites in 2010 yielded seven positive sites. Not unexpected were the six detections in Ocean City and one in Baltimore associated with tropicalplants. The fire ant is being or has been eradicated from all positive sites.Nursery Inspection and Plant Quarantine The nursery and greenhouse industry continues to be a leading part of Maryland's agricultural economy, currently ranking second among commodities, with a total of approximately$960 million in farm income. Other horticultural products and services sold boosted total gross receipts to more than $1.96 billion. A primary goal of state plant protection andquarantine efforts is to facilitate the production, sale, and distribution of Maryland nursery stock. This is accomplished in large part by inspection and certification activities conductedon-site by MDA staff. Maryland law and reciprocal agreements with other states require that plant material at each producing nursery be inspected annually prior to its subsequent sale to other statesto ensure that materials are free of dangerously injurious plant pests. State phytosanitary certificates that assure specific compliance with established domestic quarantines were issued to 10 stat es.In 2010, federal phytosanitary certificates required to export Maryland nursery stock were issued to 10 foreign countries including Argentina, Spain, and Vietnam.A total of 150 federal and 99 state certificates were issued in2010, an increase of 128 percent from 2009. MDA staff continuedto pur sue further cooperative agreement opportunities and followed revised protocols that have streamlined and improved the preparation of Maryland nursery stock for saleand dist ribution to both foreign and domestic markets. Maryland Department of Agriculture staff inspected plant material at 367 Maryland locations to intercept dangerouslyinjurious o r exotic pests. The general health of Maryland- produced nursery stock was found to be excellent. Pest Survey The Cooperative Agricultural Pest Survey (CAPS) is a joint project between the MDA and the USDA APHIS, Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ). USDA recommends specificpests o fquarantine export significance as survey priorities and provides funding for these surveys. MDA adapts the appropriate survey methods and conducts the actual surveys. This cooper- ative program has provided necessary data used to certify Maryland products for export to many countries. CAPS surveys document the presence or absence of exotic pests in Maryland, support PPQ exotic pest survey activities,and provide state-specific data for exotic pests in the United States. If any of these species were to become established, they would pose a significant threat to our agricultural productionand ha ve a sig nificant impa ct on Maryland's ability to export agricultural commodities. Early detection of exotic pests 68| Office of Plant Industries and Pest Management |Eradication efforts undertaken since the 2006 rediscovery of the emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis ) (EAB) in Prince George's and Charles counties have been redirected due to the realization that removal of all ash host material within prescribed distances from known positive trees was not eliminating the pest. A new plan of action utilizing all available strategiesincluding quarantine enforcement and chemical and biological control are being undertaken to limit the spread of emerald ash borer. Systemic insecticides are being used to treat traptrees in the immediate vicinity of known populations in conjunction with the release and monitoring of three parasitic wasps that specifically target the eggs or larvae of the beetleand kill them. (See highlight). With material and assistance from USDA, seven sites with known infestations had 33,881 parasitoids released in 2010. Larvae and adult EAB were collected and provided for propa- gation of additional parasitoids. In 2010, urban and forest trees were selectively treated around known infestations andseveral heavily infested trees were removed. Surveillanceefforts increased with 2,601 purple prism traps monitored in 21 counties and Baltimore City. Other detection methods included girdled trap trees, destructive sampling where entiretrees were debarked, biosurveillance (using a native solitary ground wasp) and v isual surveys. Detections were only made from the area surrounding the known infested zone in Prince George's and C harles count ies but show the population is increasing and slowly expanding its range. For more information on the Maryland Emerald Ash Borer Project, please an exotic pest of pine trees that was first detected in New York in 2004 and is currently known to occur in limited areas of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Vermont. Concern has been raised because this native of Europe, Asia and northern Africahas the potential to cause significant mortality of pines, including loblolly. This insect has a novel life cycle that includes inserting a fungus, along with its egg, into a healthytree so that the y oung can f eed on wood fiber digested by the fungus. This fungus quickly kills the tree. Plant Protection and Weed Management staff surveyed Maryland's eight northern tier counties bordering Pennsylvania and 14 other high risk locations. Each of the counties had 10 traps which were serviced from June through October. No target specimens were collected. Giant hogweed \u2014see write up in Noxious Weed Management Section. 69| Office of Plant Industries and Pest Management | Pine Shoot Beetle (Tomicus piniperda ), a potentially severe pest of pine trees in North America, continues to plague growers of pine and pine products in Maryland, including those involved in the nursery, Christmas tree and timber industries. This European beetle was inadvertently introduced into the Great Lakes Region in 1992. Since that time, this pest has been found in 18 states. Its detection has resulted in a federal domestic quarantine to regulate the movement of pine nursery stock, cut pine Christmas trees, pine wreaths and garlands, and pine logs from areas where it is established. Tree-growing sites within the regulated area must be surveyed and found to be free of the beetle before regulated productscan be shipped to areas outside the quarantined area. MDAsurveys first detected the pine shoot beetle in 1995 in Allegany County. From that time through 2009, pine shoot beetle hadbeen detected in Garrett, Washington, Frederick and Montgomery counties. Each of those counties has been under state and federal quarantine restrictions since the initial detections. Over the past nine years, Garrett County has experienced at least a 10-fold increase in captured beetles. In 2010, based on survey detections, four new counties were added to the Maryland pine shoot beetle quarantine (see highlight).The remaining northern counties and pine timber producing counties on the Eastern Shore were also surveyed and no beetles were detected. The Plant Protection and Forest Pest Management staff surveys, outreach, inspections and certification made it possible forgrowers to confirm compliance with federal law and to continueshipping hig h qualit y pine trees and pine products. MDA staff, in cooperation with federal Plant Protection and Quarantine officers, continued to work with the nursery, Christmas tree, and lo gging industries in the quarantined counties in Maryland to distribute information relative to the quarantine and methods of compliance in order to minimize potentialrisks and to facilitate commerce and trade. Trapping and/or visual inspections were conducted at all nurseries and tree farms that requested or required certification of Christmastrees,pine n ursery stock, and pine products. For the first time, in 2010, not all farms in Maryland met the requirements for shipment of pine trees and pine products outside of the quarantined area within the state. At several farms within the area under quarantine, beetle activity and damage was at such a substantially high level that certification for movement outside of the federal quarantine was not possible. Fortunately,most o fthe aff ected growers ship the majority of their pine products within the quarantined area so were not affected to a large degree. In areas outside of the counties under quarantine in M aryland, MDA 's Plant Protection and Forest PestManagement staff surveys, inspections and certification made it possible for growers to confirm compliance with federal law and to continue shipping high quality pine trees and pine products. Diagnostic Laboratories The Plant Protection and Weed Management diagnostic labo- ratories provide testing and analyses that support departmentalprograms and provide answers to inquiries from outside the department and from the general public. During 2010, samples submitted to the laboratory were received from within MDA,University of Maryland Extension, nursery and landscape businesses, and the general public. Entomology Laboratory There were some interesting specimens submitted to the lab in 2010, including two separately caught Megarhyssa macrurus lunator wing span and a three-inch long ovipositor which is slowly drilled into a tree trunk to deposit an egg in its host lar va.Purseweb spiders ( Sphodros rufipes) were seen and p hotographed by four people in different areas of the state; stinkhorn fungi (several species) were also widely noted this year. Paralleling increasing media reports, samplesof bed bugs ( halys ) greatly increased year. scale ( Ceroplastes floridensis ) was f ound tw ice in nursery stock and several land planarians (Dolichoplana striata ), the \"long wandering flatworm,\" were found in containers, also shipped from the South. Neitherspecies is thought to survive our winters. In mid-March,moderate rabbit damage was noted 36\" above ground level on apple branches and young hollies, following February'srecord sno wfall. Plant Pathology Laboratory The mission of the Plant Pathology Laboratory is to evaluate plant samples for plant pathogens and diseases. General activities include: evaluating plant samples in support of theNursery Inspection Program to ensure that all plant material in Maryland intended for distribution or sale is disease free; diagnosing plant diseases submitted by other sections of MDA, other Maryland agencies, home gardeners, homeowners,consultants, and industry representatives; providing technical and diagnostic support for virus-free certification programs;supporting the C ooperative Agricultural Pest Survey program through laboratory assays for specific diseases; and supporting USDA APHIS and MDA regulatory functions through diagnost ic assa ys for pathogens of regulatory importance. 70| Office of Plant Industries and Pest Management |Between March and November, the lab processed 143 diseased samples submitted from six different sources: plant inspectors (33%), home growers (31%), commercial landscapers (12%), Plant Protection section (11%), Pesticide Regulation section (9%), and Forest Pest Management (4%). samples and abiotic disorders (4%). The Plant Pathology Laboratory conducted disease surveys for plum pox virus (PPV), grape virus surveys targeted Prunus spp in 10 commercial orchards in seven Maryland counties bordering Pennsylvania. Of the 2,939 samples processedand tested for PPV using the enzyme-linked immunosorbentassay (ELISA), none were positive to the virus. (b) Grape Survey: Ten vineyards in Cecil, Calvert, Dorchester, Queen Anne's, and Talbot counties were surveyed for grape Phytoplasma yellows, and brown rot diseases. Noplants w ere found to be infected with the two diseases. (c)Seventeen nurseries and plant distribution centers in eight Maryland counties were surveyed for Phytophthora ramorum . The surveys targeted all known host and associated P. ramorum host plants. A total of 427 plant, 39 water, and 18 soil samples were collected, processed,and t ested for P.ramor uminitially in ELISA. All ELISA- positive samples were sent to a USDA-appointed lab for confirmation by the more sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. All samples tested negative for P. ramorum in PCR test. The lab also received seven P. ramorum trace forward samples from Maryland-based nurseries that bought the samples from suspect Oregon nurseries. All seven traceforwards tested negative for P.ramor um. Four contractual workers hired for the plant pathology lab in 2010 were trained in disease surveys, sample collection, processing, running ELISA, and interpretation of results. Greenhouse Laboratory Plants were produced for integrated pest management and biological c ontrol programs that require food for insect colonies and plant mat erial for research. These included purple loosestrife ( Lythrum salicaria to and mile-a-min ute weed (Persicaria perfoliata ), colonies of the stem boring weevil, Rhinoncomimus latipes . A variety of native grasses were seeded and grown as part ofour continuing effort to establish a new native grass nursery and germplasm repository at the University of Maryland Western Maryland Research and Education Center in Keedysville. A collection of herbaceous perennials used for teaching and testing purposes by the Certified Professional Horticulturist (CPH) Program, in conjunction with theMaryland Nursery and Landscape Association, was maintained. Plant Certification The MDA continues to participate in the virus-free rose certification program with Angelica Nursery, maintaining onevariety of rose as certified stock plants in 2010. This variety was propagated by tissue culture, producing a total of 213 plants. Laboratory and greenhouse personnel participated in avisual inspection of all rose plants at the nursery, both in thespring and the fall, and submitted four leaf samples of stockplants to Agdia for testing in their rose screen for viruses.Visual surveys are conducted twice a year, and testing occursonce each year. The M aryland Ginseng Management Program protects American ginseng ( Panax quinquefolius ) by monitoring the harvest and by licensing diggers and dealers of wild, wild- simulated,woods-grown and cultivated ginseng. MDA conducts a management program in cooperation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) that follows established protocols and Convention on the International Trade inEndangered Species (CITES) regulations to ensure the continuedviability of this potentially threatened native resource and to protect it from over-harvest. Harvested ginseng is certified through the program to enable licensed dealers to sell this wild-harvested plant product in international markets. MDA also works with growers of wild-simulated and woods-grown ginseng to allow them to market and export their highly valued crops. The dried roots are highly prized, especially in China and Korea, for properties that putatively promote good health. In 2009-2010, the program licensed 11 ginseng dealersand 301 ginseng collectors in the state. During the 2009-2010 harvest and sales season, the certification program inspected, collected size and age data from, weighed, and certified 195.8 pounds of dry wild and wild-simulated ginseng root; 95.0 pounds of artificially propagated dry ginsengroot and 9.5 p ounds o fwild-simulated stratified ginseng seed. The harvest and certification numbers recovered somewhat as compared to 2008-2009 when the harvest and certification numbers were among the lowest in Maryland over the last twodecades. The increase in Maryland ginseng certified and sold likely reflects an increase in price of ginseng on the internationalmarket.Harvest and sales data w ere gathered and reports were 71| Office of Plant Industries and Pest Management |submitted in accordance with FWS requirements. The amount of ginseng cultivated, including woods-grown and wild-simulated designations in Maryland, and certified by the department, continues to remain high relative to the amount of wild ginseng harvested and certified in the state. This reflects both continuing interest in ginseng as an alternativecrop, and the ability of Maryland growers to produce high quality ginseng. In this way, harvest pressure on wild ginseng may be reduced, in turn allowing wild ginseng populations inMaryland to rebound. Responses to the annual questionnaires mailed to ginseng collectors and dealers at time of licensing indicate continuing concern and frustration by some that the incidence of out-ofseason poaching of wild ginseng in Maryland remains high.T o work toward remediation of this problem, the MarylandDepartment of Agriculture continued its cooperation with the Maryland Department of Natural Resources, providinginformation and support to enable more effective policing and prosecution of violators of the regulations and laws that protect Maryland ginseng. Another positive development to aid recovery of wild American g inseng p opulations in Maryland occurred in 2010. After a number of years of deliberation and study and over a year in process, the regulations regarding wild ginseng harvest in Maryland were changed. As of July 1, 2010, the harvest seasonfor wild American ginseng in Maryland is September 1-December 15. The new regulations delay the start of the harvest season from August 20 to September 1. This change effectively gives the ginseng fruit longer to ripen, on average, and insures a higher percentage viability of seed. The change also complies with changes highly recommended by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to not only bring all states with wild American ginseng populations into harmony in terms of parallel harvest season dates, but is also based on long term research that indicates the change as necessary to insure longterm existence of wild American ginseng in its native range. Weed Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Plant Protection and Weed Management Section entomologists and staff continued to work with the Maryland Department of Transportation, State Highway Administration (SHA) to conduct an IPM program to provide biological control ofcertain thistle sp ecies. The program has helped significantly to control musk thistle along highway areas that are inaccessible to mo wing and/or spraying equipment. MDA provided technical assistanc e with noxious weed problems on public land to various federal, county and state agencies, including the University of Maryland, the Department of Natural Resources, correctionalinstitutions, county road departments, State Highway Administration and the U.S. Department of the Interior. Weed IPM research activities were conducted at field plots at the MDA facility in Cheltenham, at the Western Maryland Research and Education Center in Keedysville, and along State Highway Administration rights of ways. These cooperativeresearch projects have been conducted over each of the past 10 years. IPM investigations continued to target the suppression of Cirsium and Carduus thistles. Over the past 10 years, research has been focused on the evaluation of organisms for potential biocontrol, testing herbicide formulation efficacy, and evaluating the use of competitive vegetation (includingnative grasses and forbs), in an effort to provide environmentally sound and cost-effective methods for suppression of noxious thistle sp ecies in Maryland. In early 2010, MDA and SHA finalized a new work plan and memorandum of understanding for research over the next two years. In April 2010, MDA entered into a new two year agreement with the Research Division of the Maryland State Highway Administration to continue to monitor the impacton Canada thistle o f the Canada thistle Cassida r ubiginosa ), track the incidence and spread of the disease causing apicalchlorosis o fCanada thistle, to develop a rearing protocol for the Galerucella spp. leaf beetle, an herbivore of purple loosestrife, (Lythrum salicaria ) and implement a release program for use of this biocontrol agent on populations of purple loosestrifeon State highway right of ways, and to develop a strategy forbiocontrol of mile-a-minute weed ( Persicar ia perfoliata ) on State highway right of ways that would include lab and green- house rearing and field release and monitoring of the weevil, Rhinoncomimus latipes leaf beetles, 8,500+ of which were field released. These figures represent the largest numbers ever reared in Maryland, andindicate the growing success of our rearing program at MDA.Releases w ere ma de alo ng the Anacostia and Patuxent river watersheds and at new sites in Prince George's County. Additional releases were made in Howard County. The MDA also developed and refined a rearing protocol for the mile-a-min ute weevil ( Rhinonc omim us lat ipes).Staff members visited the New Jersey Department of Agriculture, Phillip Alampi Beneficial Insects Lab in Trenton, N.J. early in the year to learn certain aspects of the rearing protocol for R. latipes . The group then built and modified infrastructure and equipment at the MDA PP&WM greenhouse and laboratoryfacilities and s uccessful ly reared 1,400+ adult weevils. Of 72| Office of Plant Industries and Pest Management |those reared, 380+ were field released at sites in five counties in Maryland. The releases in two of those counties, Frederick and Montgomery, were the first releases ever recorded for those counties. (In 2009, the first ever releases were made in Prince George's County.) These 380+ weevils were the first \"Maryland reared\" weevils released in the state. T o date,releases of the mile-a-minute weevil have been made in Howard, Prince George's, Montgomery, Frederick, and Harford counties. MDA entomologists also continued to partner with the University of Delaware in a regional mile-a-minute weed biological control program. In this program, the University of Delaware coordinates a supply of mile-a-minute weevils, provided by the New Jersey Department of Agriculture. The MDA entomologist coordinating the project in Maryland chooses and coordinates sites for release, makes the field releases, coordinates or performs the monitoring of the release sites and the impact of the weevils on mile-a-minute weed,and collects and collates data, which is then presented to theprimar y research coordinator for the regional project at the University of Delaware. Since 2007, over 12,000 adult R. latipes weevils have been released in Maryland through this cooperative project.Six thousand weevils were released in 2010 alone. Also par tnering w ith MD A in specific aspects of these biological control projects are: the Maryland Department of Natural Resources, the Maryland-National Capital Park and PlanningCommission, and the Howard County Department ofRecreation and Parks. Funding for the projects was, in part,derived from the Maryland Department of Transportation, State Highway Administration, Research Division. Additional funding for complimentary and parallel components of these projects was derived from grants with the U.S. Forest Service and from USDA APHIS. MDA was the primary coordinating and reporting agency and conducted the majority of the \"onthe ground\" work. A survey for the presence and effects of rose rosette disease was c ontinued in 2010. Rose r osette disease is a disease of the multiflora rose ( Rosa multiflora ), a problem weed in pastures, woodlands, and rights of ways in Maryland and many otherstates.The disease, which has become established in North America and is spread by natural means, reduces populations of this invasive rose species. Since the disease was first detected in Maryland in the 1990s, results of surveys conducted by MDA Plant Protection andWeed Management staff indicate that the disease is continuing to spread over a wide portion of Central and NorthernMaryland, and has b ecome locally established in SouthernMaryland and on Maryland's Eastern Shore. In 2010, a field experiment to test the relative susceptibility of various rose cultivars and native rose species to rose rosette disease was continued at the MDA facility in Cheltenham. This experiment, begun in 2002, is intended to provide valuable information needed to assess the effects of the disease on rose species otherthan R. multiflora , including native species and cultivars important to the landscape and nursery trade in Maryland. In 2010, after many attempts at inoculating healthy plants withthe disease, the first incidence of rose rosette disease in this field experiment was noted on a landscape cultivar of rose. Noxious Weed Management This program supports the control and eradication of designated noxious weeds in order to reduce their economicand aesthetic impact on farmers and landowners. Noxiousweeds (Johnsongrass, shattercane, thistles, and multiflora rose)cause losses in excess of $25 million annually to Marylandagriculture due to reduced quality and yields of crops and forages, increased control costs, and increased roadside and development property management cost. The MarylandGeneral Assembly enacted the first Nuisance Weed Law on Johnsongrass in 1969. In 1987, the Nuisance Weed Law was rewritten and renamed the Noxious Weed Law (Title 9,Subtitle 4, Agriculture Article, Annotated Code of Maryland). The Noxious Weed Law requires that a landowner, or a person who possesses and manages land, eradicate or control the noxious weeds on that land by using practices prescribed bythe department, including mowing, cultivating, or treatingwith an ap proved herbicide. The law prohibits the importation and transportation of these weeds in the State and prohibits the presence of viable noxious weed seed and rhizomes in seed, topsoil, mulch, nursery stock, on farm machinery, or any other article. The Noxious Weed Law also provides that the Maryland Department of Agriculture may enter into an agreement with a county or political subdivision to provide technical and financial assistance for initiating weed management and eradication programs. A weed control advisory committee has been established in each of 19 participating counties, with representatives fromfarming o rganizat ions, governmental agencies, local farmers and other property owners. Each committee provides advice or input into planning the noxious weed control program in that county. A county weed control coordinator, usuallyemployed on a part-time basis, determines the degree of noxious weed infestations within the county, locates uncontrolledinfestat ions,provides information on currently recommended control practices, and initiates agreements with landowners to 73| Office of Plant Industries and Pest Management |implement a control program. In many counties, the local weed control coordinator also performs spot-spraying on roadsides, in cooperation with the Maryland State Highway Administration, to help eliminate Johnsongrass or thistles and to control noxious weeds on private or public lands for a fee. In counties with no weed control coordinator, MDA WeedControl Program employees handle these duties. The weed control program provided no grant assistance to the 19 participating counties in 2009 and this was continued in2010. The county grant agreements have subsequently been rewritten as cooperative agreements. The county programs have had to rely on increased spray revenues or fee for servicesto offset the loss of the financial component. Spray revenues for all the county programs was in excess of a million dollars. The county programs are supervised by the state personnel as specified by agreement. Noxious weed advisory notices were mailed to 228 managers of property infested with a noxious weed. Generally these notices were effective in obtaining compliance. When necessary, MDA sent follow-up correspondence resulting in compliance. The Weed Control Program responds to citizens' requests for technical assistanc e in c ontrolling invasive, difficult to control, persistent weeds, such as phragmites, kudzu, mile-a-minute, tree of heaven, Japanese stilt grass, purple loosestrife, knotweed, as well as invasive bamboo. Giant ho Heracleum mantegazzianum ) is a f ederal noxious weed that was first detected in the State of Maryland in 2003 at 29 sites in Baltimore and Harford counties. In 2005,eight additional sites in Garrett County were added to this list,as was one additional site in 2007. No new sites were found in2008 or 2009. There are currently 10 sites in Garrett Countythat ha ve und ergone several years of eradication treatments and this year no new plants were detected. Only two sites needed treatment in Baltimore County this year and none in Harford County. An eradication effort is a multi-year effort. The Weed Control staff partnered with the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR) for the 11th year in providing a phragmites management program. Upon requestfrom landowners or managers, the Weed Control Program staff supplied technical and spraying assistance for control. The DNR provided 100 percent of the cost of the herbicide(Aquane et\u00ae) ap plied in the nine Eastern Shore counties for spraying phragmites. T otal spray revenue for phragmites control was more than $75,000 for treating approximately 320 a cres in 291 locations in 16 counties.In all counties, the Noxious Weed Control Program's spraying service was offered to landowners participating in the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) or Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP). It is thought that seed contamination at planting is responsible for the occurrence and spread of noxious weeds in these plantings. Due to thelikelihood of weed problems occurring on land in these programs, spraying services were offered for noxious weed control. Other Section Activities During 2010, MDA continued to take a leadership role in the Maryland Invasive Species Council (MISC), a forum forinformation exchange and consensus building among diverse interests in public and private agencies or organizations concerned with invasive species. Several PPWM staff members were directly involved with MISC and were able to assist other members or individuals with technical expertise, as well as partner with other agencies on grants to control invasive species. Through MISC, the MDA has been able to disseminateinformation on many of the serious pests cited in this report. The MISC website is www.mdinvasivesp.org. 74| Office of Plant Industries and Pest Management | VObjective: During 2012 conduct pest risk mitigation activities that satisfy stakeholder needs regarding noxious weeds.

This program was developed by the Maryland Nursery and Landscape Association (MNLA) to raise and improve the professional standards of Maryland's nursery, landscape, and garden center industries by giving special recognition to individuals who have shown a high level of competence in the principles and practices of these industries. Certification also allows this high level of attain-ment to be recognized by the gardening public. This voluntary program is available to persons wishing to demonstrate their horticultural proficiency. After meeting acombination of educational and work experience, and studying the written manual which is the heart of the program, applicants must pass a comprehensive examination in order to be certified. The examinations are composed of both written and practical elements that are set up, proctored, and graded by MDA staff. The actual certification is issued and maintained by MNLA.The Maryland Department of Agriculture's Office of Resource Conservation (RC) works closely withMaryland farmers to plan and implement conservation practices and programs that balance crop and livestock pro- duction with the need to protect natural resources. The officeprovides a range of educational, financial, technical assistance and regulatory programs to improve agricultural management and help Maryland meet its Chesapeake Bay restoration goals.Staff works with a number of local, state and federal agencies, while implementing policies established by the State Soil Conservation Committee. Four key areas-Program Planningand Development, Conservation Grants, the Nutrient Management Program and Conservation Operations comprise the Office of Resource Conservation. State Soil Conser vation Committee Established in 1938, the State Soil Conservation Committee (SSCC) consists of 11 members representing local soil conser-vation dist ricts (SCDs) and state and federal agricultural and natural resource agencies. The SSCC coordinates the activitiesof Maryland's 24 soil conservation districts and appoints SCD supervisors. SSCC also develops, reviews and refines policieson soil conservation and water quality issues, while advising the Secretary of Agriculture on these matters. Importantly, the Committee serves as a forum for all agencies involved inprotecting natural resources. In Fiscal Y ear 2010, the SSCC approved or recommended the following policy initiatives: VRevising the cover crop milestone goal from 460,000 acres planted annually to a more realistic 325,000 acres plantedannually by 2011 VNew soil conservation district cover crop enrollment goals necessary to achieve the 2011 milestone VGuidelines and eligibility standards for the 2010-2011 Winter Cover Crop Program VA review of its turf grass nutrient recommendations by the University of Maryland of as part of the larger effort to expand nutrient management measures in order to meet new T otal Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) requirements VCoordinating financial assistance programs provided by MDA and USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) In Fiscal Y ear 2010, the SSCC received the following briefings and t racked these initiatives: VMDA 's new data tracking system, called Conservation Tracker VMDA 's Fiscal Y ear 2011 budget and potential impacts on soil conservation district support VNew state and federal requirements for animal feeding operations, including Notice of Intent requirements, law- suits and zero discharge requirements for new operations VEfforts to develop a methodology and accounting mechanism to report voluntary best management practices (BMP s) installed VRevisions to Maryland's two-year water quality milestones which substitute additional BMPs for reduced cover crop acreage goals VBMP demonstration and research project on the use of an algal turfscrubber to treat drainage water 76| Office of Resource Conservation | Office of Resource Conservation VGoal: To minimiz e nutrient losses from agricultural operations to the Chesapeake Bay and waters of the State. VObjective: To provide financial and human resources through a combination of voluntary and regulatory programs t o imp rove the management of agricultural production in Maryland so as to reduce the potential for non-point source losses of nitrogen and phospho- rus from Maryland farms. Performance Measures 2010 Actual Outcome: Reduction in nitrogen 6,127,181* loading s to Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries (pounds) Outcome: Reduction in phosphorus loadings 441,500* to Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries (pounds) * This data has b een corrected since the Budget Book publication last year. Nitrogen reduction efficiency for cover crops changed from 4.88 pounds per acre to six pounds per acre. Nitrogen and phosphorusreduction efficiencies for manure transport changed from 68 poundsof nitrogen and 60 pounds of phosphorus per ton transported, to two pounds of nitrogen and 1.76 pounds of phosphorus per ton transported.Program Planning and Development The P rogram Planning and Development section is responsible for planning , developing and coordinating policy, programs, and public information on resource conservation issues and nonpoint source pollution. Programs and activities are coordinated among local soil conservation districts, federaland state agencies, and public and private agricultural andnatural resource organizations. The section provides staffingsupport to the State Soil Conservation Committee, Governor O'Malley's BayStat initiative and the Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP) Advisory Committee. Geographic Information Systems In Fiscal Y ear 2010, staff continued to provide technical assistance and spatial data to a range of program areas within MDA. GIS is a powerful software technology used for resourcemanag ement and d evelopment planning. The technology allows a vast amount of information to be linked to a geographic location. Data from many sources, including digitized and scanne d maps, aerial photography, soil surveys, global position- ing systems data and others are integrated and analyzed to create \"smart maps\" of a specific location. During the year, staff reprocessed the 2009 Maryland Cropland Data Layer (CDL) produced by the USDA 's NationalAgricult ural Stat istics S ervice (NASS). This data identifies farm fields by crop type and corresponding acreage estimates.In addition, GIS staff continued work on the Maryland Integrated Map (MDiMap), a statewide base map that allowsgovernment agencies and the public to access state, local and municipal government spatial data sets and GIS applications. One of the applications contained in MDiMap is AgPrint,which targets areas for preservation and establishes conservation priorities. MDA is working with the Maryland Department of Planning to develop a new application whichwill display selected best management practices (BMPs) such as cover crops and progress in achieving implementation goals outlined in Maryland's Watershed Implementation Plan torestore the Bay. MDA also coordinated efforts with the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR) to develop GIS protocols and tools for targeting potential ConservationReserve Enhancement Program (CREP) riparian buffer projectslocated within 35 feet of streams and drainage ditches. Informat ion and E ducation The Information and Education Program provides creative, editorial, design, and production services to all program areaswithin the Office of Resource Conservation. In addition, theprogram provides educational displays, brochures and othercollateral materials to soil conservation districts to assist withtheir ou treach efforts. In Fiscal Year 2010, annual reports on programs that benefit the B ay including the Maryland Agricultural Water Quality Cost-Shar e Program and the N utrient Management Program were produced for the general public and interested constituents. In addition, the spring and winter editions of the newsletter, Maryland Nutrient Management News ,were mailed to approx- imately 6,500 farmers and certified nutrient management consultants. In order to promote Maryland's 2010-2011 Cover Crop Program, a comprehensive communications programwas init iated which included news releases, direct mail, print advertising and outdoor advertising. In other areas, the Information and Education program worked with members of the CREP partnership to promotethe b enefits o festab lishing streamside buffers and wetlands through direct mail, fact sheets, posters and publicity place- ment.For youngsters ages 5-10, a range of educational activity books and conservation posters were updated and distributed to educators and visitors at public events. For homeowners, fact sheets and brochures from the popular Backyard Actions for A Cleaner Bay series were updated and distributed to the Master Gardeners. Major interactive educational exhibits were provided for 35 events including the 11-day Maryland State Fair,Maryland H ome and Garden Show and T owson Gardens Day. 77| Office of Resource Conservation | VGoal: T o maintain and support Maryland's role as a local, state and national leader in the areas of agricul- tural soil conservation, water quality and nutrientmanagement policy development in order to ensure programs that are economically, environmentally, technically and socially feasible. VObjective: T o provide guidance, policy recommendations and support to assure delivery and implementation ofsoil conservation district programs to attain state water quality goals, by addressing five priority issues and refining programs to result in observable change. Performance Measures 2010 Actual Output: Number of priority issues addressed 7 Outcome: Percent of program refinements 60 or recommendations resulting in observable changeConser vation Grants Established in 1984, the Maryland Agricultural Water Quality Cost-Shar e (MA CS) P rogram he lps farmers protect natural resources on their farms, adopt sustainable agricultural practices and comply with a growing list of federal, state and local environmental requirements. MACS provides farmers with conservation grants that cover up to 87.5 percent of the cost to install conservation measuresknown as best management practices (BMPs) on their farms to protect natural resources. Thirty practices were eligible forMACS grants in 2010. In Fiscal Y ear 2010, MACS provided Maryland farmers with $17.7 million in grants to install 1,800 capital and special projects on their farms. Maryland farmers contributedapproximat ely $950,000 toward the installation of the capital projects and will shoulder maintenance and upkeep expenses of the BMPs for years to come. Collectively, the projects willprevent an estimated 1.4 million pounds of nitrogen and 89,000 pounds of phosphorus from entering Maryland waterways each year. Cover crops were responsible for the bulk of the nitrogen savings (1.2 million pounds) and nearly half of the phosphorous savings (41,362 pounds).Protecting streams from sediment pollution is another important MACS goal. In Fiscal Y ear 2010, MACS helped farmers manage an estimated 17,000 tons of soil annually by cost-sharing erosion control practices such as grassed waterways, grade stabilization structures and diversions. Managing animal wasteto protect local waterways is a major Bay restoration goal. In Fiscal Y ear 2010, MACS helped farmers construct 45 animal waste storage structures that collectively will help manage561,000 tons of manure annually. Low Interest Loans for Agricultural Conservation (LILAC) help far mers bridge the cost-share gap by providing needed cash to get a project off the drawing board and in the ground. Guaranteed by the Maryland Water Quality Revolving Loan Fund, LILAC loans are typically offered at three to four percent below market rates. They are available at lending institutions statewide. In Fiscal Y ear 2010, MACS providedfarmers with $214,390 in LILAC loans to help pay for conservation tillage and manure handling equipment. 78| Office of Resource Conservation | Gover nor Mar tin O'Malley announces record cover crop sign up during the summer of 2010, along with new innovative remote sensing technology and the conservation tracker program.Cover Crop Program Cover crops are important to the health of the Chesapeake Bay and the productivity of Maryland's farmland. Small grains, such as wheat, rye or barley, are planted as cover crops in the fall to help farmers control soil erosion on their fields over the winter and reduce the amount of nutrients that endup in the Bay. During the 2009-2010 planting season a variety of factors\u2014 including a late harvest, low cover crop seed germination ratesand heavy fall rains\u2014resulted in unfavorable planting conditions. As a result, cover crop acreage was 13 percent lower than the previous year with Maryland farmers planting206,810 acres of cover crops statewide. MACS provided these farmers with $8.9 million in grants to help offset associated seed, labor and equipment costs. On a positive note, the cover crop signup for the 2010-2011 planting season was the largest in MACS history, with more than 506,000 acres enrolled. Manure Transport Program Excess animal manure can threaten the health of the Chesapeake Bay. Poultry and livestock farmers with high soil phosp horus levels or more manure than they can utilize properly may apply for grants to help cover the cost of hauling manure off their farms. Eligible farmers receive up to $20 perton to transp ort excess manure to alternative use facilities or other operations that can use the manure safely and in accordance with their nutrient management plans. Cost-share rates are 25 percent higher for farms located inDorchester, Somerset, Wicomico and Worcester counties on the East ern Shore. Increasing the amount of excess manure that is transported annually out of the Chesapeake Bay Watershed is one way the state plans to meet the Bay's new nutrient reduction goals.In FY 2010, Maryland's Manure Transport Program helped poultry producers ship 46,226 tons of poultry litter outside of the Chesapeake Bay Watershed. Cumulatively, Marylandfarmers transported 80,899 tons of manure to approved farmsand b usinesses b oth in and ou t ofthe wat ershed using $469,398 in state grants. Delmarva poultry companies provided matching funds to transport poultry litter. Otheranimal p roducers received up to 87.5 percent cost-share or a maximum of $7,500 per farm.Nutrient Management Cost-Share MACS provides grants to farmers who hire private, non-government consultants to develop or update nutrient management plans for their farms. The reimbursement rate is 87.5 percent of the cost of the plan, up to $3,000 per operation. Grants cover one nutrient management plan/updateper operator, per year. Due to budget reductions, funding for nutrient management services has diminished in recent years. In Fiscal Y ear 2010, MACS issued $63,213 in cost-share grantsto 53 farmers in 11 counties who hired private consultants to develop nutrient management plans covering 21,471 acres of farmland. Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP) CREP is a state-federal conservation partnership that pays landowners competitive land rental rates to take environmentally sensitive land out of production and install conservation practices that protect water quality and provide wildlife habitat. Rental contracts typically range from 10 to 15 years.In 2010, promotional efforts focused on re-enrolling the firstwave of landowners whose CREP contracts were set to expire. As of June 30, 2010, CREP participation stood at 69 percent of its enrollment target of 100,000 acres. Enrollment figures con-tinueto fluctuate as some contracts expire while others are renewed or new contracts are added. CREP figures prominently in Maryland's Watershed Implementation Plan and is among the state's two-year milest ones t o pla ce natural filters on private lands. MACS provides CREP landowners with cost-share grants to establish conservation practices on land that they have agreedto no lo nger till or graze. In FY 2010, MACS provided 65 landowners statewide with $224,681 in cost-share funds to install streamside buffers, conservation cover, wetlands, livestock crossings and animal fencing on land enrolled in CREP . Maryland also provides a $100 per acre signing incentive to farmers who enroll or re-enroll in the program.Funded by the Chesapeake Bay 2010 Trust Fund, MACS provided $405,000 in sign-up bonuses for 4,050 acres of land in FY 2010. 79| Office of Resource Conservation |80| Office of Resource Conservation | VGoal: Control and reduce agriculturally related water pollution through the implementation of best management practices (BMPs).

These science-based documents specify how much fertilizer, manure or other nutrient sources may be safely applied to individual crop fields in order to prevent excess nutrients from contaminating waterways.Nutrient management plans are required for all agricultural land use d to produce plants, food, feed, fiber, animals or other agricultural products. Non-agricultural nutrient applicators, including commercial lawn care companies, landscapers, golf course managers and public groundskeepers, are required by law to followUniversity of Maryland (UME) guidelines when applying nutrients to lawns, athletic fields or other landscapes. Both agricultural and non-agricultural nutrient applicators arerequired to maintain accurate records of soil test results and nutrient applications and make these records available toMDA if they are selected for audit. The Nutrient Management Program oversees enforcement activities, a certification and licensing program for consultantsand far mers,training and e ducation programs and an urban nutrient management program. Agricultural Enforcement Nutrient Management Plan Submissions : Maryland farmers are required to submit their initial nutrient management plans to MDA. As of June 30, 2010, 5,722 farmers had filed their initialnutrient management plans with MDA. The figure represents 99.9 percent of regulated farm operators and 99.9 percent of regulated acreage (1,324,302 acres). MDA enforcement specialists worked throughout the year to bring the compliance rate to 100 percent by tracking down missing plans and collecting $2,800 in fines and penalties. MDA is currently pursuing e nforcement actions against five remaining farmers who ha ve failed to submit initial nutrient management plans for 702 acres of farmland. Annual Implementation Reports: Famers are required to update their nutrient management plans at least every third year and submit Annual Implementation Reports (AIRs) to MDA describing their use of nutrients for the previous calendar year. AIRs allow MDA to verify farm information, identify changes in property farmed and document fertilizer and nutrient use.These reports are due to MDA by March 1 of each year. In April 2010, MDA issued 1,367 warning notices to farmers who failed to file their AIRs by the March 1 deadline, followedby 473 notices of pending fines. By June 30, 2010, approxi- mately 97.2 percent of regulated farmers had submitted their AIRs t o MD A.MDA is w orking to bring the remaining farmers into compliance. In FY 2010, MDA collected $9,000 in fines ag ainst 36 far mers who failed to submit their AIRs. On-Farm Audits and Inspections : MDA 's six nutrient management specialists c onduct on-farm audits and inspections to verify that nutrient management plans are current, records are in line w ith plans, and that farmers are using plans to properly manage nutrients. In FY 2010, MDA conducted 412 imple-mentation audits covering 168,117 acres. Specialists issued 167 81| Office of Resource Conservation | VGoal: T o help farmers obtain a nitrogen and phosphorus based nutrient management plan developed and written by a certified private consultant for the proper management and utilization of all nutrient sources.

A site visit is conducted as part of this review process. In FY 2010, MDA specialists reviewed 256 nutrient management plans developed by certified consultants and farmers. All plans reviewed complied with regulatory requirements. Eighty-onecommercial nutrient applicators were also inspected and found to be in compliance. In order to participate in MDA cost-share programs, farmers must be in good standing with the Nutrient ManagementProgram. In FY 2010, MDA specialists reviewed 113 nutrientmanagement plans for farmers seeking reimbursementthrough the Maryland Agricultural Water Quality Cost-Share(MACS) Program. All of these plans met regulatory requirements. An additional 22 nutrient management plans were reviewed as par t ofthe M aryland Department of the Environment's (MDE) cr oss compliance for issuing sewage sludge utilization (SSU) permits. The majority of plans written for SSU permits failed to me et MD A's standards. Major inadequacies included missing recommendations for phosphorus and potassium and improper use of the Phosphorus Site Index tool. MDA and MDE are working with sludge management companies to fixthe problems. Certification and Licensing Programs Consultant Certification : In FY 2010, MDA certified 52 new consultants who passed the Nutrient ManagementCertification Exam, bringing to 1,148 the number of individualswho have successfully completed the program. The figureincludes 380 c onsultants who are licensed by MDA and about 130 who are actively writing plans. MDA also funded 21 University of Maryland consultants in FY 2010, down from 28 p ositions funded in Fiscal Y ear 2009 due to state budget reductions. Farmer Training and Certification: Farmers can become certified by MDA to write nutrient management plans fortheir own operations through the Farmer Training and Certification Program. In FY 2010, MDA certified 23 farmers to write their own nutrient management plans. T o date, 325farmer/operators have been certified to develop nutrient management plans for properties that they own or manage.warnings to correct major violations and documented and issued timelines for minor violations to be corrected. The majority of the violations were due to expired nutrient management plans. By the end of the fiscal year, 99 of the 167 major violations had been corrected. MDA continues to work to bring all farmers into compliance. In FY 2010, MDA collected $1,150 in fines against four farmers who failed to take corrective actions. The remaining 64 farmers are in various stages of the enforcement process. 82| Office of Resource Conservation | 0% 20%40%60%80%100% Results of Initial On-Farm Audits and Follow-Up Initial Audit Follow-Up : In 2010, MDA and UME conducted 31 voucher training sessions attended by 634 individuals seeking to obtain or renew their vouchers. T o date, 5,828 vouchers have been issued. Nutrient Applicator Training for Non-Agricultural Applicators : MDA provides training to lawn care workers who apply nutrients to private lawns, golf courses, recreation fields and other public lands. During the year, 34 participants attendedtwo training sessions offered in English and Spanish. Continuing Education : In FY 2010, MDA and UME sponsored 37 education classes on nutrient management topics ranging from the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation to thePhosphorus Site Index. More than 500 individuals attendedthe training. MDA approved an additional 50 courses and field events sponsored by other recognized organizations.Approximately 874 individuals attended this training. Nutrient Management Exam Training: MDA offers a training course for individuals planning to take the Nutrient Management Certification Exam. In FY 2010, 51 individuals completed the two-day training course. Nutrient Management Training for Soil Conservation District Personnel : In FY 2010, MDA offered a special one-day training course to help prepare soil conservation district personnel toassist animal o perations with management plans required by MDE 's Confined Animal Feeding Operation (CAFO) permit. Fifty-four individuals attended the training. Urban and Other Non-Agricultural Nutrient Management Programs Approximately 700 businesses are regulated by MDA 's Urban Nutrient Management Program. Each year, roughly 10 percent of these operations are selected randomly for inspection. In FY2010, MDA reviewed the maintenance records of 24 golf courses, 32 lawn and landscape companies and three public lands maintenance facilities. The reviews resulted in 19 warn-ings against fi ve golf courses and 14 lawn and landscape com- panies. The most common compliance issues were lack of soil tests and over application of nutrients. Operations that failedtheir first inspection were given a deadline to make corrections and received a follow up inspection. As of June 30, 2010, 12 follow up inspections were conducted with satisfactory ratings. 83| Office of Resource Conservation | VGoal: T o minimize nutrient losses from agricultural operations and non-agricultural nutrient users to theChesapeake Bay and waters of the State. VObjective: T o ensure all eligible Maryland farmers have and implement their nutrient management plan developed by certified consultants, keep records pertaining to their plans, and file a copy of their plans with the MDA. T o have all operators update their plans as needed, based on the time frame(s) set by the plans.

T echnical Assistance In FY 2010, MDA funded 74 technical assistance positions in soil conservation districts statewide, down from 75 positionsthe previous year, and well short of the 110 positions specified by the Agricultural Stewardship Act of 2006. Notwithstanding, MDA field staff is essential in helping farmers protect natural resources and meet Chesapeake Bay restoration goals. MDA field technicians work directly with farmers to develop protective Soil Conservation and WaterQuality Plans (SCWQPs) for their farms. Unlike nutrient management plans, which deal specifically with fertilizer and manure applications, SCWQPs address a range of naturalresource concerns for the entire farming operation. Due totheir importance in identifying opportunities to install bestmanagement practices to protect natural resources, SCWQPsare a k ey feature of Maryland's Watershed Implementation Plan (WIP). They are also required by numerous federal and state programs including the Federal Food Security Act, theChesap eake and Atlantic Coastal Bays Critical Area Law, and MDE 's Animal Feeding Operation (MAFO) Permit. In FY 2010, technical staff working in soil conservation district offices statewide developed 938 new Soil Conservation and WaterQuality Plans to protect 53,038 acres of Maryland farmland.An additional 889 plans covering 80,044 acres were updated. Best management practices (BMPs) are conservation measures designed to control soil erosion, manage nutrients and protect water quality. They are featured in all SCWQPs. MDA field technicians work closely with famers to design BMPs and supervise their installation or construction. They also develop maintenance plans to keep them in good working order whilehelping far mers calculate costs to install BMPs and apply for state and federal cost-share and low interest loans. T echnicians assisted farmers with the installation of 863 highly-valued BayStat BMPs in FY 2010. Enforcement Maryland uses a progressive approach to handling cases of water pollution caused by agriculture that is based on the severity of the situation. Conditions that are likely to causepollution or that have resulted in inadvertent farm pollution require timely corrective action, whereas chronic or willful mismanag ement of farm resources is handled through a for- mal enforcement action. During the year MDA and MDE,worked jointly with soil conservation districts to assess farm management complaints and take action against polluters when necessary. \"Rapid response teams\" were developed to quickly focus existing resources on evaluating and resolving possible on-farm environmental issues. Emphasis is placed on voluntary corrective actions by farmers or landowners withassistance provided by local soil conservation districts or the University of Maryland Extension. In FY 2010, 72 agricultural complaints were received concerning sediment and erosion control issues, odors, manure and livestock concerns. Of this figure, 64 complaints were corrected or closed, six complaints are pending enforcement, two complaintsare open and one enforcement action was resolved involving a complaint that was handled during FY 2008-09. 84| Office of Resource Conservation | Type of Complaints FY 2010 ater Management Drainage ditches are commonplace on the Eastern Shore. A network of approximately 820 miles of ditches is maintained by 101 public drainage associations (PDAs) and four public watershed associations in Caroline, Queen Anne's Somerset, Wicomico and Worcester counties. T ogether, these ditchesdrain 183,000 acres of agricultural and developed land. MDA works with local PDAs to ensure that operation and maintenance plans for public drainage systems are in goodworking order and that best management practices are installed to protect water quality. During the fiscal year, two wetlands were restored in the Middle Branch PDA whichdrains into the Coastal Bays Watershed. These wetlands filter more than 2,000 acres of residential and agricultural stormwater runoff monthly. Twelve additional wetlands were restored to filter 2,900 acres of stormwater runoff near the Horsebridge PDA, which feeds the Pocomoke River. The Goodwill PDA, which also drains into the Pocomoke River,restored two additional wetlands to filter 3,000 acres ofresidential and agricultural stormwater runoff.Special Projects and Grants The Office of Resource Conservation actively manages 27 ongoing research and technical assistance grants totaling $6.6 million for special programs and demonstration projects designed to help dairy farmers, small-sized equine operations, poultry producers and other landowners improve pasture andmanure management, control soil erosion, manage nutrients, reduce runoff and safeguard water quality in streams, rivers and the Chesapeake Bay. In FY 2010, the program received several grants to assist in establishing a nutrient trading program for Maryland that creates a public marketplace for the sale and purchase ofnutrient credits (phosphorus and nitrogen). Conservation Tracker MDA piloted its new Conservation Tracker database system in local soil conservation district offices this year. ConservationTracker provides Governor O'Malley's BayStat program withaccurate information on BMPs in use on Maryland farms that have positive benefits for the Bay. It uses a geo-referenced profile of the location of BMPs installed on Maryland farmsand calculat es the n utrient reduction credits Maryland farmers receive for their efforts. The system highlights BMPs specified by Governor O'Malley's two year milestones by documentingthe b road array of water quality BMPs that have been installed on Maryland farms using federal and state grant funds. The data helps MDA target technical and financial resources toareas that can achieve the greatest water quality benefits.In the future, Conservation Tracker will be expanded toinclude additional BMPs that the farmers have installed without government assistance. Nutrient Trading The Maryland Nutrient Trading Program is a public, voluntary marketplace for buying and selling nutrient credits. When fully implemented, the program is expected to play a critical role in enhancing water quality in the Chesapeake Bay and itstributaries by creating incentives for private sector financing ofagricult ural practices to further reduce nutrient runoff and emissions. The Maryland trading platform is based on the World Resources Institute's NutrientNet suite of tools. Itincorporates both Chesapeake Bay Program models and the national Nutrient Trading T ool (or NTT) developed by USD A 's Natural Resources Conservation Service. Maryland's trading program currently provides nitrogen and phosphoruscredits but will eventually include sediment and carbon trad- ing. T o assist those interested in trading, MDA has establisheda website that c ontains a cr edit calculator, a marketplace, and a central registry. Whether credits are sold directly to a buyer or 85| Office of Resource Conservation | On-farm best management practices such as stream fencing, streamside buffers and watering troughs help farmers better manage farms and protectMaryland's streams, rivers and the Chesapeake Bay.through a third-party broker or aggregator, the online marketplace serves as a convenient and constantly updated location to assess trading activity and find potential trading partners. The web site can be accessed at www.mdnutrienttrading.com. In FY 2010: VHouse Bill 974 authorized MDA to establish an agricultural certification, verification, and registration program to support nutrient trading. VWeb site developed and available. VClose to 1,200 people attended regional outreach and informational meetings held around the state to introduce the nutrient trading program. VEight training workshops in Maryland and West Virginia, gave 126 participants hands-on experience in using theonline calculation tool. Maryland Envirothon MDA and so il conservation districts sponsor the Maryland Envirotho n,an outdoor natural resources competition for high school students interested in learning about natural resources and gaining a better understanding of today's complexenvironmental issues. Designed by soil conservationists,foresters, wildlife experts and other natural resource profes-sionals, the Maryland Envirothon challenges students to move beyond the classroom in order to solve real life environmental problems in a natural setting. Students compete at the local,state and nat ional le vels. A five-member group of Boy Scouts from Carroll County won this y ear's state competition and went on to place 5th among more than 270 teenagers from 45 U.S. states and 9 Canadian provinces at the 2010 Canon Envirothon held at California State University in Fresno August 1-6, 2010. The team was awarded $7,500 in Canon scholarships. The Maryland Envirothon is sponsored by the State Soil Conservation Committee and the Maryland Association ofSoil Conservation Districts. 86| Office of Resource Conservation | VGoal: T o improve the water quality and habitat of the Chesapeake Bay region by utilizing programs and staffresources to reduce nitrogen and phosphorus levels from agriculture that meet or exceed the new agricul- tural Tributary Strategies goal of 50 percent nitrogenand 60 percent phosphorus load reduction from pre- 1985 loads from agricultural sources by 2010. VObjective: T o develop and promote soil conservation and water quality plans and best management prac- tices to meet local water quality goals for nitrogen andphosphorus by increasing new and revised planning acres under the new Tributary Strategies to 80 percent (800,000 a cres) coverage by 2010 and environmentally friendly ditch maintenance to 25 miles of public drainage by the end of 2010.
