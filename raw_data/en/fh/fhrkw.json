Expert Reviews User Summarized Score What experts liked What experts didn't like Herb Garden Kit Rankings Herb Garden Kit Overview Herbs provide interesting flavors and compliment many different recipes. If you frequently cook with herbs, growing your own little herb garden can be a cost-effective way to go. This way, you don't have to buy a large bunch from the grocery store when you only need to use a few stalks. However, if you don't have a green thumb or a lot of gardening experience, then starting with an herb garden kit can help. An herb garden kit contains everything you need to start your very own herb garden. There are a number of different types of kits available. For example, for those who don't have a lot of outdoor gardening space, an indoor herb garden kit can be placed on a bright windowsill or somewhere else in your home where there is a lot of natural light. Outdoor herb garden kits come with biodegradable pots that can be plated directly in your garden bed. Depending on your climate, you can start the seeds indoors and then move them outdoors when the weather permits. And for those that don't get much natural light in their homes, an electronic herb garden kit is the answer. These kits offer all the bells and whistles, like LED growing lights and self-watering features. Whether you plant your herb garden indoors or outdoors, there are a few elements to consider. Herbs require 6-8 hours of direct sunlight. The light actually affects the flavor of the herbs too. The brighter the light, the stronger the flavor of the herbs. Temperature is also another thing you'll want to note. Herbs flourish in temperatures between 65 to 70 degrees Fahrenheit. Make sure your home isn't too cold for your indoor herb garden, and don't plant them outside until the weather permits. If it's too cold, your herbs will not be able to grow properly, and may die out. Buying Advice - When you're in the market for an herb garden kit, take a look at what is included inside. At the very least, you'll want to have a variety of seeds. Note which seeds are provided and whether those are ones you like to eat and cook with. Herb garden kits may come with cilantro, thyme, parsley, basil and oregano. For some shoppers, it may be important to search for organic or non-GMO seeds. - In addition to seeds, herb garden kits may include soil or potting soil discs, You may also get burlap grow bags which can be used in lieu of pots. Some kits include biodegradable pots instead. You'll also find plant markers, so you can clearly label which herbs you've planted in which pots. - If you're in the market for an electronic herb garden kit, you'll want to get one that has powerful LED grow lights that can last for several hours. Many of these types of kits also have a self-watering function, where you need to fill the water reservoir. - If you have young kids who are interested in gardening, consider getting an herb garden kit that doubles as an arts and crafts activity. You can find kits that come with paint and paintbrushes so kids can decorate their gardens with their artistic skills. Not only is this a great way to grow your own herbs, but kids can learn more about the gardening and growing process while having fun with paint. - When it comes to watering your herbs, be sure to not overwater. Herbs prefer infrequent and slow watering, otherwise, the soil becomes too moist. Ideally, you'll want to only water your herbs two or three times a week. Don't worry if the top of the soil looks dry. It's likely that the soil closer to the roots is wet, which is what's important. "}
