Affiliations Testimonials I have been a patient at Mitchell Center for Natural Healing for several years. Dr. Leah Mitchell and Glenn Soja have guided me through a sometimes complex journey to health with great skill and compassion. It seems whatever challenge I present, they have the answers to lead me as I've aged into my 70's. I'm not sure where my health would be without these two extraordinary and kind healers. They are truly two of my many blessings. A friend who is also a Doctor of Oriental Medicine recommended I see Glenn Soja when I was experiencing multiple dermatological issues at once. Glenn Soja listened patiently, astutely diagnosed my ailments, and charted an effective and swift treatment path. I found Glenn Soja to be thorough, compassionate, deeply knowledgeable, and generous with both his time and knowledge. I recommend Glenn Soja and the Mitchell Center for Natural Healing without reservation. I really don't know how I got so lucky to have Leah Mitchell and Glenn to count on with my health. I started with Dr. William Mitchell 25 years ago and was so happy when Leah and Glenn kept the practice and blossomed into a wonderful center for healing. I'm 63 years old and very active and healthy due to the care I have from both of these amazing caring humans. They are so helpful to find the right treatment, and solutions to health problems. They have been my primary care for years and that's probably why I am healthy staying away from western medicine. I am always happy to refer anyone to Mitchell Center for Natural Healing, you can trust you are in the best care. I came to Glenn with a sudden outbreak of eczema, which I had never had before and was very disturbing. I was in so much distress that I was willing to travel from the next state over to find someone I had confidence in. Glenn has been a lifesaver. Before, I was hardly getting any sleep with how itchy and crazy I felt. Within a few weeks of taking Chinese herbs, I started feeling better, and I was back to normal within months. Highly recommended! I have been seeing Leah Mitchell for health care since 2006, and I was a patient of her dad for years before that. I am pretty sure you can't find a kinder and more caring person to see to your health care needs. An important thing for me is \"bed-side manner\" and Leah is awesome considering I am not the best patient in the world in terms of following advice. I hate needles and she is the best at drawing blood of anyone I have ever had do it. She is caring, and listens. Highly recommended. I was referred to Glenn Soja by a trusted friend from the Natural Medicine world. I had heard that Chinese Herbs could be very effective in treating Crohn's disease, which I had recently been diagnosed with. My symptoms significantly improved within weeks of taking the herbs. They also made me feel a little happier and with more balanced energy. As a bonus, my psoriasis started to clear up as well! Glenn Soja is so easy to talk to (these subjects can be rather embarrassing!) and he truly listens. He is incredibly compassionate, knowledgeable, and thorough. I love that the herbs come in little sealed pouches, already made and easy to take. I found them easiest to drink at a cooler temperature, down the hatch, nose plugged. I would HIGHLY recommend Glenn Soja. I am taking a hiatus due to pregnancy but as soon as I can, I will be back to resume my treatment. I have been a patient of both Leah and Glenn for nearly 20 years, and they have successfully shepherded me through several of my health crises. They have kept me well informed of how I can avoid chronic conditions that could damage my health and longevity by incorporating the established science and latest developments in natural healing. They have worked closely as a team to address a certain number of my temporary ailments. And they understand the importance of allopathic medicine in screening for conditions that more readily affect the elderly, like with men's prostates and everyones' colons. And their offices are clean and modern, with plenty of free parking nearby. Most significantly, they have created a safe space where mutual respect and complete communication are honored. Traditional Chinese Medicine has been very effective for my psoriasis (otherwise known as torture!). I don't understand how it works, but given all the new science coming out about all the systems in our bodies operating on a microbial level, it is clear that there is a lot that Western medicine doesn't know. I previously used prescription steroid creams, but they were not as effective and the condition seemed to worsen. Glenn has specialized training in dermatological conditions.
