How to massage: Using your fingertip, press hard on the acupoint and hold for 30 seconds. Soreness is expected. Do it daily 1-2 times a day.

Joint or muscle pain Acupuncture / cupping Acupuncture -The insertion of extremely fine needles into the skin at specific acupoints promotes blood and Qi circulation, and triggers the body to release natural painkillers. Cupping - improves circulation of blood, Qi and lymph, flush out built-up toxins and waste, relieve muscle tension and ache and promotes the body's natural healing process. Both TCM treatments are to be done by a TCM physician for safety and efficacy. Apply ointment / pain-relief patch Need quick pain relief at home?

If you experience persistent heart palpitations and chest tightness even with light activities and no alternative diagnosis by a Western doctor can be found, acupressure alone is not sufficient.

It is usually administered at acupoints located at the pericardium and heart meridian.

Do take note that there are 2 types - Sweet apricot kernels ( Tian Xing Ren, also known as Nan Xing) and bitter apricot kernels ( Ku Xing Ren, also known as Bei Xing). While they are both good for treating cough, they have slight differences in function. Bitter apricot kernel: has a stronger anti-asthmatic effect. It also has a laxative effect. Due to its mild toxicity, it cannot be eaten raw, only upon cooking or roasting can they be consumed. Do not use more than 10g a day. Sweet apricot kernel: has a stronger nourishing effect on the lungs, which is good for people with dry cough. It has no toxicity. However, its cough-relieving effect is not as strong as the bitter apricot kernels, hence they are usually used in combination with the bitter ones.
