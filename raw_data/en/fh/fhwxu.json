Cortisol helps break down carbohydrates, fats, proteins in your body. It also controls blood pressure and affects how the immune system works. There are two adrenal glands in the body and are located near the kidneys. They work cooperatively with the hypothalamus and pituitary glands in the brain. Adrenal disorders can be categorized as primary, secondary, or tertiary: Risk Factors Disorders usually occur when the immune system attacks healthy adrenal glands. Other causes may include: Symptoms With Addison disease, a bluish-black color around the nipples, mouth, rectum, scrotum, vagina, or other places may occur. Diagnosis An examination from a physician will be required, but there are tests that can assist in diagnosis, including: Treatment Addison's disease can be deadly and is an extreme adrenal disorder. Treatment includes: Symptoms of Addison disease can be severe, and this acute adrenal event is called an Addisonian crisis. This can occur when your body is stressed, such as from dehydration, fever, illness, surgery, or if the proper medication is not being taken, such as corticosteroids. Lack of treatment can result in: Call your healthcare provider if: Get medical help right away if you have sudden severe symptoms or an Addisonian crisis. Disorders that impact the metabolism of calcium in the body include: What is excessive hair growth, or hirsutism? Hirsutism is excess hair growth on the body or face. For women, the hair may grow in areas uncommon for them. This includes the upper lip, chin, chest, and back. It is due to an excess of hormones called androgens. Although all women naturally produce some androgen, high amounts can cause hair growth. It's caused by an excess of male hormones called androgens. All women naturally produce small amounts of androgens. But high levels of this hormone can lead to hirsutism. Risk factors What are the symptoms of hirsutism? Symptoms can occur a bit differently in each person. They include darker or thicker hairs growing on parts of the body such as: The symptoms of hirsutism can look like other health conditions. See your healthcare provider for a diagnosis. How is hirsutism diagnosed? Your healthcare provider will ask about your symptoms and health history. They will give you a physical exam. You may also have blood tests to check for increased androgen levels. These tests can also check for other problems that may cause excess hair growth. How is hirsutism treated? Treatment depends on personal preference. Hair growth causes no physical harm. The decision to remove or reduce hair varies from person to person. Methods to remove or reduce unwanted hair include: Other medicines can reduce the hormones that cause hair growth. It can take 6 months or longer for you to see results from these medicines. This is because hair grows, rests falls out, and regrows in cycles that last for months. And not all hairs are in the same part of the cycle at the same time. Because of this, treatments that affect the hair you have now may need to be repeated over time. Medicines that can change hormones to affect hair growth include: Other factors that can lessen excess hair growth include: What is a fertility disorder? Fertility disorders are those conditions that cause a female to be unable to become pregnant, usually after one year of trying. Many times ovulation is disrupted or absent and monthly menstruation is irregular. During ovulation, hormones are released from the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland in the brain, which signals an egg to develop and be released from the ovary. A disorder will disrupt this process. Risk factors Cushing syndrome may also cause infertility, which is a disorder where very high levels of cortisol are being released in the body. Causes could be certain medications or other external factors. Symptoms might include weight gain, diabetes, high blood pressure, osteoporosis, muscle loss, fragile skin, extra facial hair in women, colored stretch marks on the torso, depression, confusion, or extra far on the upper body or a rounded face. There are other factors impacting fertility, including drug use, sexually transmitted diseases, medications, certain chronic conditions, endometriosis, or other problems with the reproductive system. Diagnosis Treatment What is hypertension? Blood pressure is the force of blood traveling through an artery. With each heartbeat, blood is pumped from the heart and into the blood vessels. Every time the heart beats, pressure is created inside arteries as the heart contracts and relaxes. High blood pressure occurs when the force inside the arteries is too high during the contraction or relaxation. Complications of high blood pressure include Risk Factors Symptoms Very high blood pressure may exhibit: Diagnosis There are four ratings of blood pressure: Treatment Lifestyle changes Medicine What is hypoglycemia? Hypoglycemia is when the blood sugar, or blood glucose, the level is too low. Glucose is the main source of fuel for the body with carbohydrates being the primary source of glucose. Hypoglycemia can be a complication of diabetes or another disorder or a sole condition within the body, but it is closely associated with diabetes. Causes Other causes of hypoglycemia are rare, but it could occur in early pregnancy, alcohol or substance abuse, after extreme exercise, during prolonged food fasting, or from a tumor. Symptoms Hypoglycemia can also occur during sleep. Some signs include: Diagnosis The ideal range of fasting morning blood sugar is 70 to 99 mg/dL (milligrams per deciliter). Blood sugar levels lower than 70 mg/dL are too low. Blood tests will determine blood sugar levels. It may be a complication of diabetes or an insulin reaction. Treatment To treat low blood sugar immediately, an item with concentrated sugar needs to be consumed: It may also be recommended to: Untreated hypoglycemia can cause fainting, and, in severe instances, can lead to a coma, seizures, or death. Prevention A diet of rice, potatoes, bread, cereal, fruit, and sweets will help prevent blood sugar levels to get too low, but there are a variety of ways: What is a metabolic disorder? Metabolic disorders are disorders that impact the distribution and absorption of certain nutrients like carbohydrates, fats, proteins in the body as a reaction following the regular metabolic process. Symptoms Symptoms are usually characterized as acute, progressive, late-onset, and permanent. Risk factors Types of disorders: What is a pituitary gland disorder? The pituitary gland is a gland at the base of the brain that produces a variety of hormones that impact different organs and parts of the body. This gland is often referred to as the master gland because it has control over most of the endocrine glands. When the pituitary gland is not functioning properly, various health conditions can arise. When not enough growth hormone is created, for example, stature is stunted in a child, while if not enough luteinizing hormone is created in women, it can cause issues with ovulation, menstruation, and fertility. Symptoms of a pituitary gland disorder Types of pituitary gland disorders What is Polycystic ovarian syndrome? Polycystic ovarian syndrome is a series of symptoms due to issues with women's hormones and affects the ovaries. In polycystic ovarian syndrome cysts that can develop on ovaries create a hormone called androgen, which is mostly found in men. Though naturally found in small amounts in women, when the level is too high, it causes issues with a woman's menstrual cycle and subsequent symptoms. Women with polycystic ovarian syndrome could develop other serious health concerns, including diabetes, high blood pressure, and uterine cancer. Risk factors Symptoms Diagnosis Treatment Types of puberty problems What is a sex development disorder? At birth, a child's genitalia is present. In certain cases, the gender-specific genitalia is not clear. Causes There are 46 chromosomes in each cell of the human body and are grouped into 23 pairs. The 23rd pair determines gender. Females have two X chromosomes, and males have one X and one Y chromosome. The gender of a developing baby is determined at conception. Around the 6th week of fetal development, a boy's genitalia begin to form. Risk factors Types of disorders Other disorders include: What is a thyroid disorder? The thyroid is a gland located in the upper chest or lower part of your neck and is an endocrine gland that produces hormones, which include thyroxine, triiodothyronine, and calcitonin. It helps maintain and control activity within the body, including how the body burns fat and calories. Disorders occur when the gland is not functioning properly. Disorders include: Diagnosis A medical provider will need to perform an exam, and blood tests may be needed, or ultrasound or scan. Treatment Treatment depends on the condition, but some may involve: What is thyroid cancer? The thyroid has two main types of cells: C cells and follicular cells. Cancer develops from the rapid growth of these cells. Tumors and nodules, or lumps, can grow. Not all are cancerous, but they can spread into nearby tissues and other parts of the body. Nodules are usually benign, or noncancerous, and can occur at any age but mostly in older adults. They made up of cysts filled with fluid. Some don't need to be treated, but many do as adverse symptoms develop. Types of thyroid cancer Anaplastic cancer is aggressive carcinoma and is rare. It may develop from existing cancer, and it may be referred to as undifferentiated because it does not resemble other normal thyroid cells. It can spread quickly and is difficult to treat. Differentiated cancer resembles normal thyroid tissue and usually develops from follicular cells. It is the most common type of thyroid cancer. Most differentiated cancer is papillary cancer that grows slowly and from one lobe of the thyroid gland. The lymph nodes in the neck usually are impacted if it spreads to that part of the body, and it can be treated and rarely causes death. Follicular cancer is a type of differentiated cancer that usually occurs where iodine is not found enough in someone's diet, while Hurthle cell cancer is a difficult differentiated form of cancer to treat. Medullary cancer occurs from c cells, which makes calcitonin, a hormone that aids in controlling calcium in the blood It can spread to various organs, including the liver and lungs, and it can be both an inherited cancer or can be sporadic and not tied to genetics. Other types of thyroid cancers include parathyroid cancers, which affect small glands attached to the thyroid. Risk factors Diagnosis A medical provider can help detect swelling or lumps or nodules, particularly in the neck. Other methods include: Stages of thyroid cancer Thyroid cancer is usually staged based on the size of a tumor, or (T), the spread to lymph nodes, or (N), and then spread to distant tissue, which is called metastasis, or (M). A table of the different stages along with other detailed information can be found [here](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/thyroid-cancer/detection-diagnosis-staging/staging.html).
