The Act also establishes the ACT Discrimination Commissioner at the Human Rights Office. In the first decade of self-government, the Discrimination Act becomes the primary vehicle for the protection of human rights in the ACT. The Office of the Youth Advocate ACT merges into the Community Advocate. Functions include advocacy, rights protection, investigation of complaints, guardianship, management of affairs, representation in court and monitoring of orders. 1994 The ACT Government appoints the first Victims of Crime Coordinator upon commencement of the Victims of Crime Act 1994 (VoC Act). 1994 The ACT becomes the first Australian jurisdiction to recognise the rights of people in de facto and caring relationships under the Domestic Relationships Act 1994 (VoC Act). 2002 Gallop report recommends establishing independent disability commissioner 2003 FEMAG report on review of oversight agencies recommendations new disability commissioner in merged Human Rights Commission 2004 The ACT becomes the first jurisdiction in Australia to enact a comprehensive Human Rights Act (HR Act). The HR Act protects a range of fundamental rights and freedoms drawn from the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. These include the right to life, the right to a fair trial, the right to privacy, and freedoms of expression, association and religion. It also establishes the Human Rights Commissioner in the existing ACT Human Rights Office The Vardon Report recommends an independent Commissioner for Children and Young People. 2005 The Office of the Community Advocate becomes the Public Advocate. 2006 November: The ACT Human Rights Office becomes the Human Rights Commission. The Commission is made up of the Human Rights and Discrimination Commissioner and the Health Services Commissioner. 2007 January: The new Children and Young People Commissioner; and Disability (and Community Services) Commissioner appointed. 2008 The Human Rights Act is amended to require all public authorities in the ACT to act in a way that is compatible with human rights, and to properly consider relevant rights in decision-making. These obligations are enforceable against public authorities through a direct right of action in the ACT Supreme Court. A proportionality test also clarified when human rights may be limited by s28 (2). 6 ACT Human Rights Commission1986 Self-Government begins in the ACT 2011 The VoC Act is amended to establish a Victims of Crime Commissioner in place of the Victims of Crime Coordinator. 2013 Under amendments to the HR Act, the right to education becomes the first economic, social and cultural right to be recognised in the ACT. 2014 The Births, Deaths and Marriages Registration Act 1997 is amended to improve legal recognition of sex and gender-diverse people; to introduce a third legal sex category; and to remove the requirement for persons to undergo surgery before changing their legal sex. 2016 February: The HR Act is amended to recognise that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people hold distinct cultural rights and must not be denied the right to maintain, protect and develop their culture. The Commission, the ACT Government and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Elected Body develop these amendments jointly. Separate amendments are also passed strengthening the existing right to education. The Discrimination Act is amended to provide safeguards against discrimination on the basis of a person's status as a victim of domestic or family violence; accommodation status; employment status; immigration status; and physical features. The amendments introduce intersex status as a stand-alone attribute for the first time. The amendments also allows people to complain about vilification on the grounds of disability, religion or intersex status. 2016 April: The Human Rights Commission is restructured to include the Public Advocate, the Victims of Crime Commissioner and Victim Support ACT. 2019 The Victims of Crime Commissioner begins work on ACT's first intermediary program. The program, due to commence in early 2020, will initially include child complainants in sexual offence matters and child witnesses in homicide matters. It will provide independent communication specialists, or intermediaries, to facilitate the provision of clear evidence by child witnesses. 7 Annual Report 2018-19Mr Shane Rattenbury MLA Minister for Justice and Community Safety Legislative Assembly for the ACT Canberra ACT 2601 Dear Minister,This Report has been prepared under section 7(2) of the Annual Reports (Government Agencies) Act 2004 and in accordance with the requirements under the Annual Report Directions. It has been prepared in conformity with other legislation applicable to the preparation of the annual report by the ACT Human Rights Commission (the Commission). We hereby certify that the attached Annual Report is an honest and accurate account and that all material information on the operations of the Commission during the period 1 July 2018 to 30 June 2019 has been included. We also certify that fraud prevention has been managed in accordance with Public Sector Management Standards Part 2. Section 13 of the Annual Reports (Government Agencies) Act 2004 requires that you cause a copy of the report to be laid before the Legislative Assembly within three months of the end of the financial year. Yours sincerely, Dr Helen Watchirs OAM President4 October 2019 ACT Human Rights Commissioners (from left), Discrimination, Health Services, Disability and Community Services Commissioner, Karen Toohey, Public Advocate and Children and Young People Commissioner, Jodie Griffiths-Cook, President and Human Rights Commissioner, Dr Helen Watchirs, and Victims of Crime Commissioner, Heidi Yates. SECTION A: Transmittal certificate 8 ACT Human Rights CommissionFrom the President and Human Rights Commissioner Dr Helen Watchirs OAM. I would like to thank all Commissioners and staff for their hard work and dedication over the year, demonstrating their commitment to the vision and values of the Commission: providing 50 formal comments on draft Cabinet Submissions, formal pieces of written legal advice or submissions 102 community engagement activities handling 1596 enquiries and 683 complaints assisting 1698 victims of crime with assistance and receiving 453 new applications under the victim services financial assistance scheme (FAS) advocating for, or otherwise monitoring, more than 1300 people brought to the attention of the Public Advocate. One of the Commission's most significant roles is oversighting the Alexander Maconochie Centre (AMC) adult prison under the Corrections Management Act 2007, along with other key agencies; and the Bimberi Youth Justice Centre (Bimberi) under the Children and Young People Act 2008 (CYP Act). In April 2019, the Commission released a report by Discrimination, Health, Disability and Community Services Commissioner, Karen Toohey, into a range of claims about the treatment of children and young people in Bimberi between 2014 and 2017. The human rights legal team assisted with research and investigative work. The review found that there was no evidence of systemic abuse in Bimberi, but improvements were identified that could be made to better address the needs of young people in detention. The report however did identify continuing issues with staffing levels, lockdowns and de-escalation and recommended that use of force guidelines and training materials be reviewed to ensure that staff are being given clear, consistent and practical guidance on the safest techniques for restraint when use of force is unavoidable. It also recommended amending the CYP Act in relation to the use of force and segregation. Significantly the Commission recommended that the ACT Government provide alternative settings for young people up to the age of 12 years, who are coming into contact with the criminal justice system. This builds on previous Commission recommendations in 2005 and 2011 that the age of criminal responsibility in the ACT be raised to at least 12 years. The Commission continued to host meetings of oversight agencies with responsibility for monitoring the AMC, with the Inspector of Corrective Services providing secretariat support. The Commission supports the ACT Government's initiative in developing human rights standards for the AMC, but agrees with the adverse findings of the Inspector in regard to the treatment of remandees and in particular women detainees. We look forward to the Inspector's jurisdiction extending to Bimberi in December 2019. In March 2019, together with the Australian Human Rights Commission, we hosted another ACT consultation roundtable about the implementation of the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture (OPCAT), in preparation for our additional international obligations coming into force in the future. 9 Annual Report 2018-19 Section A: Transmittal CertificateThe Commission finalised its operations protocol, which has been in draft form since the merger with the Public Advocate and the Victims of Crime Commissioner in 2016. We also refreshed our disability action plan in the context of the development of the ACT's first disability justice strategy. The Commission wrote to the ACT Government to implement this strategy, following the Australian Human Rights Commission's 2014 Report Equal Before the Law: Towards Disability Justice Strategies . Victims of Crime Commissioner Heidi Yates co-chairs the reference group for the disability justice strategy, and all Commissioners also participated as members of this important reference group. Human rights are increasingly embedded in our work, and cross-referrals of clients to provide multiple services between teams continues to grow. I am especially proud of the Commission's increasing reach into the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community and multicultural communities to provide culturally appropriate services. This has been achieved by having identified staff positions. Following the expiration of the Commission's reconciliation action plan (RAP), we have developed a cultural safety charter under the guidance of a reference group of strong leaders and service users from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. We define cultural safety as providing clients, staff and colleagues with a safe, nurturing and positive environment where people are respected, and cultural rights and spiritual values accepted by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island peoples are supported by the Commission's values, processes and policies. The charter contains five core values of respect, collaboration, integrity, accessibility and courage. It highlights our four priorities of: peoples' rights welcoming place engaging with trust and respect providing safe services. The Commission's cultural safety charter. OUR VALUES Respect Collaboration Integrity Accessibility Courage 1 Peoples' rights We encourage and accept Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples' right to self-identity and respect their cultural rights protected under s 27 (2) of the ACT Human Rights Act 2004 and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Cultural and religious rights are also protected under the Discrimination Act 1991 . We accept that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have the freedom to live well, and to live according to their values and beliefs. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander staff are supported to fulfil their cultural responsibilities and obligations. All staff are supported to undertake a process of reflection on their own cultural identity and any unconscious bias.2 Welcoming place Our welcome mat, in person, by phone or in community is a warm, comfortable and safe place. Our environment and space is accessible and available for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Our place values and respects Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples' cultural rights, and we recognise the importance of their ongoing connection to land, waterways and other resources.3 Engage with trust & respect We walk with people, take time to listen respectfully, provide consistent communication and follow up. Our engagement with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples is grounded in our legal commitment to the ACT Human Rights Act 2004. We will continue to build respectful relationships in partnership with community, based on mutual trust and learning.4 Provide safe services Safe service is defined by the people who receive the service, and is based on the experience of those accessing the service. Our service demonstrates privacy, discretion, compassion, integrity, is non-judgmental and without bias. We are responsive and flexible, with time and meeting places including outreach. We provide supportive warm referrals within the Human Rights Commission and to other services. Staff are committed to better understanding the impacts of direct, vicarious and intergenerational trauma, which informs our strengths -based service approach.CULTURAL SAFETY CHARTER CULTURAL SAFETY The Human Rights Commission provides our clients, staff and colleagues with a safe, nurturing and positive environment where Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples are respected. Cultural rights and spiritual values accepted by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples are supported by our values, processes and policies to ensure culturally safe services. The journey so far: there is so much more - we continue to learn and appreciate the experiences of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and acknowledge their culture - at 65,000 years, the oldest continuous living culture in the world.OUR PRIORITIESNgattai yeddung (Ngunnawal) Listen good 10 ACT Human Rights CommissionIt is important to note that safe services are defined by the people receiving the service, and are based on their experiences of the Commission's services, so we are committed to monitoring ongoing client satisfaction. The Commission celebrated the anniversary of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) on 13 September 2018. With the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Elected Body (ATSIEB), we co-hosted a screening of the film After the Apology at the National Museum of Australia. Larissa Behrendt's documentary tells the story of four Aboriginal grandmothers who campaigned to bring their grandchildren home from care and protection placements around Australia, using a dialogue of pride that emphasises the importance of investing in a family's connection to culture. UNDRIP has special significance in the ACT, because parts of articles 25 and 31 are reflected in s27 (2) of the Human Rights Act (HR Act). Since 2016 the HR Act has explicitly recognised Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultural rights. The Commission's Respecting Rights project, run by Karen Flick and previously Nat Brown, is designed to breathe life into these cultural rights in the community, both informing people about how to assert these rights; and informing public authorities about how to respect them in practice. In June 2019 the Commission made a submission to a review of child protection decisions, arguing that the lack of full review mechanisms under the broad discretionary framework makes the legislation incompatible with human rights. We recommend that external review be available for child protection decision-making both of the Community Services Directorate (CSD) and outsourced service providers, to uphold the rights of children, young people and their families.On International Human Rights Day on 10 December 2018 the Commission co-hosted a community forum celebrating the 70 th Anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) at the National Library of Australia. The UDHR70: Time to Act? Forum focussed on the need for a national human rights act to legally implement international human rights obligations and hold government to account. Our co-hosts for the event were the UN Information Centre, Amnesty International and Australian Lawyers for Human Rights. I was honoured to be asked to speak about the ACT's practical experience of implementing human rights legislation over 15 years, at two events in Sydney and Brisbane. I spoke about the need for local and national human rights legislation, and I especially welcomed the Queensland Human Rights Act 2019 . I look forward to the development of a practical and enforceable charter of rights for victims of crime, by amending the HR Act as well as the Victims of Crime Act 1994 (VoC Act). As highlighted in previous reports, the Commission recommends that access to justice would be enhanced by having the right to complain to the Commission about human rights breaches, in a similar way to discrimination matters which have free conciliation as a resolution process. The ACT Law Reform Advisory Council ceased to operate at the end of 2018 after a decade of impressive work, and we look forward to the Government's development of a replacement body. In the meantime we call for the Council's last report from October 2018, Canberra - Becoming a Restorative City , to be released publicly as it has relevant recommendations about enabling human rights complaint mechanisms. 11 Annual Report 2018-19 Section A: Transmittal CertificateFrom the Discrimination, Health Services, Disability and Community Services Commissioner Karen Toohey. My role as the Discrimination, Health Services, Disability and Community Services Commissioner enables me to ensure a strategic approach to themes and trends we see across these jurisdictions. We work to improve outcomes for the ACT community, particularly vulnerable groups which rely on our timely interventions to deal with issues that directly affect their quality of life and access to equality in the community. This covers a diverse range of issues from access to housing, access to and quality of health services in both the public and private sectors, equal access to education for students, care and protection concerns, standards of care in adult and youth detention facilities, and standards for care and service delivery for people with a disability. My work in this role also addresses the discrimination that groups within our community experience, while participating in public life, because of the range of attributes protected by the Discrimination Act including race, disability, gender, family and parental responsibilities. We work at both an individual and systemic level to identify and address concerns raised through contact with the community including complaints, training and education, participation in community events and forums, and direct engagement with key stakeholders. As a member of a range of consultative and oversight committees, I work to ensure the practical work and the individual experiences we deal with in complaint handling informs policy and practices across a broad range of settings that fall within my remit. Our own-motion investigations in the area of disability have looked at a range of service providers and the quality of services being provided, funding models and participation in community, as the transition to the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) continues and service delivery models in the ACT adapt to a new environment. In the area of health services, we have endeavoured to use own-motion investigation to work with health providers to improve processes and practices and highlight areas that need greater oversight and quality assurance such as security of health records, monitoring of the use of physical and chemical restraint and seclusion. Handling individual complaints made by community members is a significant part of the work my team undertakes. Over the year we have further consolidated and streamlined complaints processes with a greater focus on offering conciliation as a means of bringing parties together to try to resolve their concerns and contributing to the ACT Government's ongoing work on restorative justice. 12 ACT Human Rights CommissionSome notable achievements in our complaint handling this year included: handling a 35 per cent increase in complaints since 2016-17 receiving double the number of children and young people (CYP) complaints 88 per cent of people who completed a Commission survey at the closure of a complaint said the process was fair, accessible and understandable the number of Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander people accessing our process rose from nine in 2016-17 to 54 in 2018-19 releasing a major report in to Bimberi Youth Justice Centre undertaking a range of community engagement activities at libraries, community events and in collaboration with key stakeholders to raise awareness of our legislation and the complaint handling process providing training and information sessions with a range of organisations to build workplace capacity in understanding discrimination law and processes co-developing a range of community resources to help community access our services. I look forward to continuing this work in 2019-2020 to promote a safe, inclusive and diverse ACT community. Commission poster with information about making a discrimination complaint. We can help.

ARTWORK 'SPIRIT DREAMING' BY BC 191053 HRC Call Us Report 2018-19 Section A: Transmittal CertificateFrom the Victims of Crime Commissioner Heidi Yates. ACT Policing report that 3,711 violent offences occurred in the ACT in the 2018-19 financial year.1 It is likely these statistics represent only a proportion of violent offences committed in the ACT, with research indicating that many violent offences, particularly those relating to family violence and sexual assault, are never reported to police. 2 Crime can have devastating effects on a person's life including their safety, health, sense of self-worth, employment and relationships. Impacts can be life-long and often extend to a person's partner, children, parents, friends and support networks. As Victims of Crime Commissioner (VOCC), I am responsible for delivering a range of frontline services to help individuals and their families deal with the effects of crime. It is essential that all victims of crime can get the help they need, when they need it. To this end, a key focus of my first full year as VOCC has been improving access to our front-line services for vulnerable community members. This work has included: Successfully advocating for resources to employ two full-time, permanent Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander victim liaison officers. We are establishing a new Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander program within Victim Support ACT (VSACT) to provide a safe point of contact for community and to lead our culturally-responsive work with indigenous clients. In February, we re-allocated resources to trial a designated cultural liaison officer position. Our cultural liaison officer is working to strengthen VSACT's ties with diverse communities across Canberra and to ensure that our service model and service offerings meet the needs of clients from different cultural backgrounds. We are progressing practical initiatives such as ensuring all staff are comfortable using interpreters, increasing the number of counsellors and other providers who speak a range of languages, and providing outreach services at the Multicultural Hub in Civic. Driving stronger engagement with front-line workers in the disability sector, ensuring that they understand the services we can provide to their clients and our capacity to meet people at outreach locations across Canberra to provide confidential information and support. Strengthening our connections with LGBTIQ+ organisations to improve options for people from LGBTIQ+ communities who need to access expert, trauma-informed counselling to deal with the impacts of crime. As a result of the work above, the VSACT team has responded to growing requests for assistance, with a 30 per cent increase in the number of new clients registered for case coordination under the victim services' scheme (VSS) and a 16 per cent increase in FAS financial assistance scheme (FAS) applications. 14 ACT Human Rights CommissionAnother key aspect of my role as VOCC is to monitor the extent to which criminal justice agencies recognise and respect the central role of victims in the criminal justice process. Without the evidence of victims, we do not have a criminal justice system. Yet aspects of current process and practice continue to act as a barrier to people reporting crime, with many fearful that engagement with the criminal justice system will compound, rather than address, the harm perpetrated against them. I continue to work with my justice sector colleagues to advocate for reform of law and legal processes leading to a system that better promotes the safety and interests of people harmed by crime. For example, in July 2018, I wrote to over 800 VSACT clients to invite them to contribute their views to the ACT Government's consultation on a charter of rights for victims of crime. I commend the Government for getting out into the ACT community to raise awareness of the consultation and taking the time to meet face-to-face with victims to hear their views. I will continue to work closely with the Government over the coming months to support the introduction of a charter that will deliver practical, enforceable rights for victims. Throughout the year, I have also advocated strongly for the introduction of an intermediary program in the ACT to minimise trauma for vulnerable witnesses and ensure their best evidence is available to police and the courts. In October 2018, I invited interstate colleagues to Canberra to share their experience of the NSW and Victorian intermediary programs. The visit was an important opportunity to build understanding across the ACT of the role that witness intermediaries play in the criminal justice process. In June 2019, the ACT Government committed $5.8 million over four years to establish an intermediary program in the ACT, to be administered by our team. The funding will support the phased introduction of an intermediary scheme in certain offence matters, initially including child complainants in sexual offence matters and child witnesses in homicide matters. We look forward to working closely with our justice sector colleagues to deliver a program specific to the ACT's needs, for commencement in early 2020. Throughout the year, my team and I have worked to ensure that victims' perspectives are considered in a range of justice initiatives including the roll-out of restorative justice conferencing in sexual assault and family violence matters establishment of the ACT's Drug and Alcohol Court review of the ACT's consent laws development of an ACT parole time credit scheme for offenders ACT Corrective Services' development of a no contact list, which allows victims to opt-out of being contacted by AMC detainees. I also had the pleasure of co-chairing, with Dougie Herd, the reference group for the ACT's new disability justice strategy, which we hope will guide much-needed improvements in the way that the civil and criminal justice systems engage and respond to people with disability and their families. There is still a great deal of work to be done. I remain grateful for the support and commitment of my VSACT colleagues, my fellow Commissioners and the broader Commission as we work collaboratively to deliver better outcomes for people harmed by crime in the ACT. 15 Annual Report 2018-19 Section A: Transmittal CertificateFrom the Public Advocate and Children and Young People Commissioner Jodie Griffiths-Cook. As the ACT Public Advocate and Children and Young People Commissioner, I am privileged to bear witness to the strengths of and challenges for children, young people and adults in the ACT who, by the nature of their circumstances, are arguably some of our most vulnerable citizens. The consolidation of functions from my two statutory roles gives me unique insights into community and system dynamics that may lend themselves to increased vulnerability. It also increases the visibility of multi-dimensional issues that involve numerous service systems. The work my team and I do changes lives. Whether this be by supporting a child or young person to speak up about, and seek to resolve issues they have experienced; intervening in a court or tribunal to ensure a person's rights are appropriately upheld; or highlighting areas for improvement in those systems whose operations we monitor and oversight. Our work is underpinned by a solutions-focused approach that seeks to ensure improved outcomes for those we represent, whether we are tackling issues individually or systemically. By considering issues that are brought to my attention through a systemic lens and identifying underlying themes and trends, I am able to adopt a strategic approach to addressing them, including by identifying and advocating for innovative solutions that have proven successful in other jurisdictions. This past year saw us: successfully advocate for the introduction of the Safewards initiative in mental health inpatient units initiate capability development workshops to assist organisations to more effectively engage children and young people in policy development and service reform improve oversight of seclusion and restraint of children and young people in health settings increase our advocacy support for people involved in court proceedings for family and personal violence matters. This was in addition to my team providing public advocacy services for over 1300 children, young people and adults experiencing vulnerability; and direct individual advocacy for over 500 individuals. Many of the matters in which we intervened were complex and multi-faceted. However the outcomes that were achieved improved the safety and wellbeing of those for whom we acted, while also ensuring that their rights were upheld by the agencies involved in providing their care and support. We also provided a range of opportunities for children and young people to speak to us directly about issues impacting their lives. Their views contribute to the way we support them; and how we consider issues that are brought to our attention, including the way we respond to policy proposals. 16 ACT Human Rights CommissionNotably these opportunities are not limited to large- scale consultations but are also built into our everyday operations in a way that empowers children and young people to raise their concerns directly, knowing they will be acted upon and taken seriously. The range of work undertaken this past year could not have been achieved without the commitment and dedication of my staff who tirelessly engage in the pursuit of improved outcomes. I commend my team and I commend the strength of those we stand alongside and whose rights and interests we seek to uphold. I am proud to be part of this important work and look forward to furthering our achievements in the year to come. 17 Annual Report 2018-19B.1 Organisational overview The Commission promotes the human rights and welfare of all people living in the ACT. The Commission is an independent agency established in 2006 under the Human Rights Commission Act 2005 (HRC Act).

The Domestic Violence Project Coordinator's functions in relation to reducing the incidence of family violence include: monitoring and promoting compliance with the policies of ACT and Commonwealth governments assisting government and non-government agencies to provide services of the highest standard facilitating cooperation among agencies and organisations assisting in the development and implementation of policies and programs. 19 Annual Report 2018-19 Public Advocate and Children and Young People Commissioner The role of the Public Advocate and Children and Young People Commissioner (PACYPC) is to: advocate for children, young people and adults in the ACT community whose condition or situation makes them potentially vulnerable to abuse, exploitation or neglect monitor and foster the provision of services for persons experiencing vulnerability provide oversight in respect of the systems that support and respond to the needs of persons experiencing vulnerability engage with and listen to children and young people to ensure their voices are heard on issues that affect them improve services for all children and young people. Statutory public advocacy Statutory public advocacy exists to ensure that services and systems do what they are supposed to do in the way they are supposed to do it, and ideally, in a timely and responsive manner. Notably, statutory public advocacy refers to the legislative requirement for the PACYPC to undertake specific functions in accordance with provisions established by legislation. Statutory public advocacy is generally called upon when community advocacy responses have been unable to facilitate a solution and/or when the need for advocacy relates to a system for which the PACYPC has statutory responsibility. 20 ACT Human Rights CommissionACT Human Rights Commission Organisational chart Public AdvocacyDiscrimination Health Services Disability and Community ServicesChildren and Young People Engagement and ParticipationDiscrimination, Health Services and Disability and Community Services Commissioner Karen TooheyPublic Advocate and Children and Young People Commissioner Jodie Griffiths-CookVictims of Crime Commissioner Heidi Yates Intermediary ProgramVictim Advocacy Victim Services Scheme Financial Assistance SchemePresident and Human Rights Commissioner Dr Helen Watchirs OAM Human Rights Legal and PolicyCorporate Support ServicesCommunity Engagement 21 Annual Report 2018-19 Strategic plan 2017-2020 Commissioners and Commission staff continued to work together to implement our strategic plan 2017-2020 Operations protocol During the reporting period, the Commission finalised its first operations protocol as required under s18C of the HRC Act, and following a long consultation over a draft document. The protocol will guide Commissioners in fulfilling their statutory roles and providing quality services to the community over the coming three years. It is available on the Commission's website.Client services charter 2016-2019 The Commission continued to implement its client services charter 2016-2019. The charter is based on the Commission's commitment to human rights and belief that all people deserve to be treated with respect and dignity. It explains what the Commission does, what clients can expect from it, how it provides services and how to offer feedback to help improve its services. During the next reporting period, feedback will be sought from the community on improving the Charter. 3 22 ACT Human Rights CommissionB.2 Performance 2018-19 highlights 1596 ENQUIRIESIn 2018-19, the Human Rights Commission handled 683 COMPLAINTSnew ap plications under the victim services financial assistance schemeIn 2018-19 the Human Rights Commission received 453formal comments on draft Cabinet Submissions, formal pieces of written legal advice or submissions.In 2018-19, the Human Rights Commission provided 50 In 2018-19 , the Human Rights Commission advocated for and monitored people brought to the attention of the Public Advocate.1300In 2018-19 , the Human Rights Commission assisted 1698 victims of crime. 23 Annual Report 2018-19 Human Rights Commissioner Strategic priority 1: Make human rights relevant to everyone Working with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community Increase in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander clients In this reporting period, there was an increase in the number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander clients applying for FAS. Fifteen per cent of applications received in 2018-19 were from Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander applicants, up from 10 per cent in 2017-18. Similarly, the Discrimination, Health Services, Disability and Community Services Commissioner and her staff saw an increase in Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander community members utilising the complaint process. Complaint numbers continued to rise from 9 in 2016-2017, to 40 in 2017-2018, to 54 in 2018-2019. Complaints made by Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander people made up 8.6% of the total complaints received this reporting period. We attribute these increases to the work of our three Aboriginal staff members; the support provided to these staff members by the wider Commission; and outreach to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community, community leaders and key stakeholders including ATSIEB. These staff are: VSACT Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander victim liaison officers Tanya Keed and Brenton White Aboriginal liaison officer and cultural advisor, Karen Flick, from the human rights team. In this reporting period, Tanya Keed was instrumental in running a yarning circle. Through the yarning circle, Ms Keed gives Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander detainees and parolees the chance to yarn about important issues within a supportive group. Cultural safety charter to replace reconciliation action plan In late 2018, the Commission began work on a cultural safety charter to replace the Commission's third innovate reconciliation action plan 2015-2018 (RAP). The plan was developed by Aboriginal liaison officer and cultural advisor, Karen Flick. She engaged an external reference group which included Pat Anderson, chair of the Lowitja Institute; Diane Collins, strategy and policy officer from the ACT Ombudsman; Rod Little, National Congress co-chair; Nekol Stuart, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander engagement Red Cross; Ashley Johnson, community member; and Tamara Murray, community member. Prior to the development of the cultural safety charter, the Commission continued to implement its RAP, as part of its core work of improving the quality of services, and access to services; as well as protecting and promoting the human rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Respecting culture: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultural rights in the HR Act The HR Act explicitly recognises Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people's cultural rights. Section 27(2) of the HR Act was drawn from articles 25 and 31 of UNDRIP. UNDRIP is not a binding treaty but has significant persuasive power over government. Community outreach on cultural rights has included a new brochure, business card and factsheets. These materials have been well-received at Commission stalls throughout the year. They were also distributed to all ACT branch libraries and are available on a dedicated page on the Commission's website. 24 ACT Human Rights Commission Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultural rights Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples hold distinct cultural rights and must not be denied the right to maintain, control, protect and develop their culture, and to have their traditional connections with land, waters and resources recognised and valued. Nautilus by Lynnice KeenA cultural rights wallet card. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Elected Body The Commission worked closely with ATSIEB in 2018-2019. It reported to ATSIEB on its activities and gave evidence at an ATSIEB estimate-type hearing on 29 March 2019. To commemorate the 11th anniversary of UNDRIP, and raise awareness of section 27(2) of the HR Act, the Commission and ATSIEB co-hosted a screening of Larissa Behrendt's film After the Apology , at the National Museum of Australia theatre on 13 September 2018. Over 200 people attended. Commission President, Dr Helen Watchirs chaired a discussion panel with speakers Katrina Fanning, ATSIEB, Barb Causon, Our Booris, Our Way steering committee chair, Rod Little, National Congress co-chair and Jodie Griffiths-Cook, ACT Public Advocate and Children and Young People Commissioner. Visit to Ngunnawal Bush Healing Farm In February 2019, Commissioners and staff received a warm welcome to country and a tour of the Ngunnawal Bush Healing Farm, located outside Canberra, near Tharwa. Discussions with the staff at the Farm provided useful insights into the rehabilitation needs of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community, and opened the way for referrals to the Commission. Reconciliation week 2019 On 28 May 2019, the Commission hosted a stall at the ACT Government-sponsored Reconciliation in the Park event at Glebe Park, commemorating the ACT's second Reconciliation Day. It was a very cold day and members of the community appreciated receiving Commission-branded beanies. The event included live music, traditional dance, storytelling, bush tucker talks and other activities, with positive engagement from members of the community at the Commission's stall. Reconciliation in the Park 2019: (from left) Professor Peter Radoll from the University of Canberra, Dr Chris Bourke and Professor Tom Calma, University of Canberra Chancellor and Reconciliation Australia co-chair (Courtesy RiotACT). Australian Council of Human Rights Authorities The President and Human Rights Commissioner, Dr Helen Watchirs, and Discrimination Commissioner, Karen Toohey are members of the Australian Council of Human Rights Authorities (ACHRA). ACHRA comprises the state, territory and federal human rights, equal opportunity and anti-discrimination authorities. It meets regularly to discuss matters of mutual interest. The Council met in October 2018 and April 2019. During the reporting period, Dr Watchirs handed responsibility for chairing ACHRA over to Dr Niki Vincent, the South Australian Commissioner for Equal Opportunity. 25 Annual Report 2018-19 NAIDOC family day 2018 The Commission joined NAIDOC celebrations, hosting a stall at the NAIDOC family day at the University of Canberra on 9 July 2018. Staff organised colouring in and badge-making activities for children. The day featured entertainment and live performances from artists and musicians, with a range of arts, crafts and other family activities. Children at the Commission stall at NAIDOC family day in July 2018. Raising human rights awareness and impact As part of its commitment to leading and embedding systemic change within the ACT public sector and increasing awareness of human rights issues in the community, Commission staff delivered training and presentations on human rights and discrimination to a wide range of people and groups. Some of these training sessions and presentations were generic, while others were tailored to the specific work and needs of ACT public authorities and employees. (See Section N: Community Engagement and Support.) Strategic Priority 2: lead systemic change to address vulnerability Oversight of places of detention The Commission participates in several activities to provide oversight of the operations and conditions of ACT's detention facilities including Bimberi and the AMC. It convenes regular meetings of oversight agencies in in order to share information and discuss concerns, without the authorities from the detention facilities present. One involves agencies responsible for the AMC and the other for the Bimberi. Other AMC oversight agency representatives, including the ACT Ombudsman and Official Visitors; and on occasion, Prisoners Aid and Winnunga Nimmityjah Aboriginal Health and Community Services also attend. Secretarial support is provided by the Deputy Inspector of Correctional Services. The Commission attends regular meetings, convened by relevant directorates, with the AMC General Manager and the Bimberi Executive Branch Manager. The Commission maintained a close monitoring role for Bimberi throughout 2018-2019. Oversight functions performed by the PACYPC include reviewing segregation, strip searches, the use of force, lockdown, time-out and critical incidents; as well as advocating for individual Bimberi detainees. The Discrimination, Health Services, Disability and Community Services Commissioner, Karen Toohey, completed a Commission-initiated consideration of Bimberi in the reporting period. (See p31.) 26 ACT Human Rights CommissionReviewing Cabinet submissions and other human rights consultations The Commission reviewed law reform proposals and related policy changes for compatibility with the HR Act and other standards, principles and policies applicable to our work. The Commission provided formal comments on approximately 40 draft Cabinet submissions, from a much larger number which we reviewed. However, these submissions are Cabinet-in-Confidence and further information about them cannot be revealed, but human rights compatibility was achieved in draft legislation. Generally, directorates accepted the Commission's formal comments on submissions, particularly where we requested changes to draft and subordinate legislation and made changes to submissions, draft policy documents, draft or subordinate legislation. A number of ACT Government directorates also consulted the Commission directly and requested advice on the human rights compatibility of a range of policy and legislative proposals throughout the course of 2018-2019. While some of these consultations were also confidential, the following are summarised here: The Commission continues to work with the ACT Government to implement the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse and to ensure that any policy or legislative changes which are progressed as part of the implementation process are compatible with the HR Act. The Commission was consulted on the draft human rights standards for ACT Corrective Services, in conjunction with the new Inspector of Correctional Services. Various teams across the Commission continue to support the C ommunity Service Directorate's (CSD) senior practitioner in her new role, including participating in working groups and sitting on the restrictive practices oversight steering group. The Commission participated in the Auditor-General's audit report into recognition and implementation of obligations under the HR Act. The VOCC co-chaired the ACT Government's disability justice reference group, with all Commissioners sitting on the group. Advice to ACT Policing on the use of tasers and compliance with the HR Act. Comments on draft Transport Canberra and City Services Directorate body worn video procedure. Discussions with Justice and Community Safety Directorate (JACSD) on proposed unexplained wealth laws and introduction of parole time credit. Working with the ACT Government and the VOCC on the development of a charter of rights for victims. Advocacy on raising the age of criminal responsibility Since 2005, the Commission has consistently recommended that the minimum age of criminal responsibility should be raised to at least 12 years, in line with international human rights standards and rights protected in the HR Act. In 2007, the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child confirmed that 12-years-of-age should be the absolute minimum age for criminal responsibility, but also reflected that state parties should continue to increase it to a higher age level. The median age of criminal responsibility around the world is 14 years, based on the understanding that children younger than 14 years are not considered developmentally mature enough to be criminally liable. Increasing the minimum age of criminal responsibility would not abrogate the Government's responsibility to protect the community and to address situations where young children commit serious acts of violence or become involved in other criminal activity. It would, however, require a shift in focus to providing therapeutic support and assistance to these children and their families, to address the causes of this behaviour, which often reflect trauma or other complex needs. As the first jurisdiction in Australia to provide legislative protection for human rights, the ACT is in a strong position to provide leadership on this issue, as all Australian jurisdictions reflect upon the important lessons from the NT's Royal Commission into the Detention and Protection of Children. The PACYPC is a member of the Australia and New Zealand Children's Commissioners and Guardians (ANZCCG). In both of its two communiques in 2018-19, the ANZCCG called for the minimum age of criminal responsibility to ideally be raised to at least 14 years, and no lower than the internationally acceptable minimum age (currently 12 years). 27 Annual Report 2018-19 Human rights and policy submissions The Commission made submissions to various inquiries as follows. Court interventions The Human Rights Commissioner may, with the leave of the court, intervene in legal proceedings that involve the HR Act (s 36). During the reporting period, the Commissioner was notified of seven matters and intervened in two. The first was before the ACT Court of Appeal concerning the scope of police powers to arrest without a warrant for breach of bail. The Commissioner submitted that, using the ordinary principles of construction, including the interpretive obligation in s 30 of the HR Act, the power to arrest without warrant in s 56A of the Bail Act 1992 did not extend to a right for police to enter a person's home for the purpose of effecting the arrest. The Court of Appeal, however, dismissed the application of the HR Act because it considered that s 56A had a settled meaning. Based on its view of the purposes and legislative history of s 56A, the Court of Appeal concluded that s 56A carried with it a common law right for police to enter any place at any time to arrest someone who breached a bail condition. The matter was appealed to the High Court but was eventually settled. The government nevertheless moved to introduce legislative criteria to guide the use of the arrest power in s 56A, citing human rights reasons for introducing the amendments. The Commissioner also intervened in an action brought by a young person detained at Bimberi. The young person alleged breaches of her human rights at the Centre, including of her cultural rights (under s 27(2)). The matter involved the young person being segregated as well as having art materials and the Koori Times newspaper confiscated. The matter is ongoing. Review of child protection decisions In June 2019, a joint submission by all Commissioners provided significant feedback on the ACT Government's discussion paper Review of Child Protection Decisions in the ACT. The Commission considers that the broad discretionary framework under the CYP Act to make decisions about a child or young person's care, combined with a lack of appropriate mechanisms to challenge and remedy such decisions, is incompatible with the HR Act. On their own, existing internal merits reviews are not sufficient to meet the requirements of the HR Act. External merits reviews of child protection decisions made by Child and Youth Protection Services (CYPS), as well as by outsourced service providers, such as ACT Together, are necessary to uphold the rights of children, young people and their families. Several Commissioners also participated in the Our Booris, Our Way review of care and protection services. (See p55, Our Booris, Our Way. ) Mental Health Act review The Commission provided input into two reviews of provisions of the Mental Health Act 2015 (MH Act) regarding emergency detention/treatment and involuntary orders. In response to the latter review, the Commission noted that the intent of the legislation, i.e., for better consideration of mental health consumer's capacity and views, was not reflected in practice. Similarly, the Commission raised concerns about victims not receiving notification of ACT Civil and Administrative Tribunal (ACAT) decisions. Healthy prisons Various teams across the Commission collaborated in submissions to the Inspector of Custodial Services' Healthy Prisons Review . (See also p55 Health services in the AMC.) ACT Integrity Commission A submission was made to the select committee on an Independent Integrity Commission 2018, supporting the establishment of an independent integrity body to investigate, detect and prevent corruption in the public sector. The submission noted the human rights limitations of a scheme creating wide-ranging coercive powers. The submission concluded that many limitations would be reasonable if the provisions were carefully drafted with appropriate safeguards. 28 ACT Human Rights CommissionAdoption Act review dispensing with consent The President and PACYPC provided a joint submission to the ACT Government's discussion paper, Dispensing with Consent , concerning possible reforms to the Adoption Act 1993 to support more timely and appropriate adoption processes, facilitating permanent outcomes for children and young people. The submission highlighted human rights issues with the proposals; and that consent should only be dispensed with where the parent cannot consent; they have effectively waived their right to consent; or exceptional or special circumstances justify consent where it is in the best interests of the child or young people. Other comments and submissions Further, the Commission proactively commented on important human rights issues outside formal consultation and submissions processes. Examples of such comments include: Feedback to ACT Corrective Services on policies and procedures for the management and care of detainees. Discussed proposed new laws regarding the reporting of child sexual abuse and the seal of the confessional, with the Hon. Justice Julie Dodds-Streeton to inform her report to the ACT Government on how best to implement certain recommendations from the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse. Council of Attorneys-General discussion paper on tendency and coincidence evidence in sexual assault cases. Public comment on various issues via the media. (See Section N: Media and community engagement). Strategic Priority 3: enhance services and service delivery Law Reform Advisory Council In 2018, the President and Human Rights Commissioner, Dr Helen Watchirs, and VOCC Heidi Yates served as members of the Law Reform Advisory Council (LRAC) until the Council expired. During the reporting period, LRAC provided a copy of its report, Canberra - becoming a restorative city to the Attorney-General. The report has not yet been published by the ACT Government and this is of concern to the Commission. The report included two case studies, about child protection decisions and public housing, using a restorative framework. Human rights advice to MLAs Under a Parliamentary Agreement for the Ninth Assembly of the ACT, signed in October 2016, all Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) can seek independent formal advice from the Commission, including human rights assessments of non-executive bills, without requiring permission from or notification to the Attorney-General. To ensure transparency, any formal written advice from the Commission to MLAs is published on the Commission's website. In the reporting period, the Commission provided the advice to Mr Jeremy Hanson MLA on his Crimes (Anti-Consorting) Amendment Bill 2019. 29 Annual Report 2018-19 Discrimination, Health Services, Disability and Community Services Commissioner Strategic Priority 2: lead systemic change to address vulnerability Commission-initiated considerations A Commission-initiated consideration can be conducted if there is a concern about a systemic problem. Examples of this include where: a number of complaints or notifications about a particular practice or organisation are received a complaint is made anonymously the person does not have personal standing, capacity, involvement or authority to make a complaint the community raises an issue, such as in the media. In these circumstances, it is the Commissioner who becomes the complainant and matters are investigated as a complaint. In a Commission-initiated consideration, the Commissioner will work with organisations to resolve any issues identified during the investigation process. This may include updating policies or practices, undertaking staff training or recruitment, and making recommendations to improve service delivery or compliance with relevant standards. The Commissioner can make formal recommendations, and in those cases will seek evidence of compliance or will revisit the issues with the organisation after an agreed review period. In 2018-19, the Discrimination, Health Services, Disability and Community Services Commissioner began 12 new Commission-initiated considerations and closed 14. Table 1: Commission-initiated considerations. Jurisdiction Opened Closed Health 8 8 Discrimination - 1 Disability 3 4 Children and Young People 1 1 Total 12 14Methadone prescribing at the Alexander Maconochie Centre Mr Philip Moss's Report of the Independent Inquiry into the Treatment in Custody of Mr Steven Freeman: So Much Sadness in Our Lives (the Moss Report) recommended \"that the Health Services Commissioner (of the ACT Human Rights Commission) conduct an own-initiative investigation into the prescription of methadone to detainees at the AMC\". The Commissioner's report, completed in March 2018, made 16 recommendations, relating to: assessment for eligibility to the opioid replacement therapy (ORT) program monitoring of intoxication and overdose dosing procedures preventing and responding to diversion throughcare for detainees transitioning to the community needle and syringe exchange program. Many of these recommendations have been implemented. The commencement of a dedicated alcohol and other drugs nurse, and expansion of the use of iDose (automated methadone dosing) have been of particular value. These have standardised the assessment process for detainees wishing to access the ORT program at the AMC and reduced the number of medication errors associated with ORT. Despite the improvements noted, more can be done. While counselling and rehabilitation programs are available at the AMC, these do not appear to be immediately available to detainees newly inducted to the AMC. It also appears many detainees do not continue with ORT once released. As recommended in the Commission report, further support and aftercare appears to be required. 30 ACT Human Rights CommissionBimberi Youth Justice Centre In April 2019, the report on the Commission-initiated consideration into Bimberi was released. The report looked into a range of allegations and concerns about the treatment of young people at Bimberi in the period from 2014 to 2017. Over an 18-month period, the Commission met with young people held in Bimberi, Bimberi staff and management, parents and carers of young people who had been held in Bimberi, support and oversight staff and agencies including the Bimberi Official Visitors. The Commission also reviewed extensive information obtained from CSD and other relevant stakeholders, conducted physical inspections of the facility, reviewed and analysed data from registers of searches, use of force, segregation and complaints, and viewed CCTV footage and reports of numerous incidents. Overall, the Commission's investigations did not reveal widespread disregard for the human rights of young people at Bimberi, or the mistreatment of young people. Most young people interviewed spoke highly of most staff members at Bimberi. While the Commission did find evidence of some incidents of excessive or unjustified use of force by staff, the Commission was satisfied that Bimberi management had generally treated issues seriously, conducted reviews of all incidents, and taken appropriate action where misconduct has been established. The Commission considers that maintaining appropriate staffing levels and providing ongoing staff training is key to a functional and human rights compliant youth justice centre. Insufficient staffing contributed to a dramatic increase in lockdowns during the review period. This in turn resulted in young people's reduced access to education and programs, leading to frustration for young people, and increased risk of staff injury and burnout. The Commission made a number of targeted recommendations to address the key issues identified during the course of the Commission-initiated consideration. This includes recommendations in relation to: upgrading the security camera systems while still ensuring the privacy of young people is protected reducing reliance on restrictive practices such as use of force and segregation ensuring that the prohibition on using the prone restraint is clearly reflected in all training and guidance material ensuring accurate records are maintained of the total amount of time each day that a young person has access to exercise and to open air while in segregation ensuring that young people are provided with face-to-face educational support while in segregation introducing amendments to the CYP Act in relation to segregation and use of force reviewing staffing arrangements at Bimberi to develop and fully resource a long term staffing strategy recording operational lockdowns, code lockdowns and extended overnight lockdowns in a lockdown register which is subject to oversight ensuring training for staff reinforces the prohibition against the use of 'squat and cough' procedures during strip searching reviewing the dual use of the Coree Unit for induction and segregation reviewing the administration of medication practices reviewing the drug and alcohol services and programs, as well as rehabilitation services, currently available to young people at Bimberi and consider how more proactive support could be provided to young people while in detention to assist with rehabilitation from drug and alcohol dependence implementing a systematic program of throughcare developing a flexible therapeutic protection place or other suitable therapeutic placements in the community to better meet the needs of children and young people aged under 14 who engage in harmful conduct and come into contact with the youth justice system. The Government response to the report was released in June 2019 with all recommendations agreed or agreed to in principle. The Commissioner looks forward to working with CSD on the full implementation of the recommendations. These are being monitored through the Bimberi oversight group, which the Commissioner participates in. 31 Annual Report 2018-19 Commission staff spring out in support of the LGBTIQ community during the Canberra Fair Day at SpringOUT in November 2018. Mental health services for young people with disability The Commission initiated an investigation into mental health services provided to young people with a disability following the identification of patterns emerging from individual complaints. These patterns related to the use of restraint and seclusion for young people, the role of the child and adolescent mental health service and the access young people have to senior mental health clinicians. The service provider met with the Commission to discuss these issues and agreed to provide the Commission with a written response including the current action plan to improve mental health services for children and young people. The service also provided a summary of the strategies implemented over the past five years in the paediatric ward. The Commission was satisfied that the issues were being addressed, and will continue to seek periodic updates. Accommodation services for people with disability The Commission initiated two investigations into accommodation services for people with disability. In the first investigation, concerns were raised about bullying, understaffing, unnecessarily strict visitation rules, lack of advocacy and NDIS funds being used inappropriately by the disability accommodation service. The service provided a response that clarified the visitation rules, made changes to NDIS fund spending, staffing requirements and the development of person-centred plans. Commission staff attended the service to review documentation and discuss the concerns raised with staff and residents. The Commissioner was satisfied that a reasonable explanation was provided and a process was implemented to revisit the service to ensure sustainability of the implementation of those changes. In the second investigation, concerns were raised about the quality of care provided to residents at an accommodation service. The Commission sought further information from the service including the outcome of internal reviews. The internal reviews found that there were issues with file management, management of medication, staff training and regular audits. Commission staff visited the service to review the information provided and discuss the issues raised with staff, family members and residents. The Commission noted that there had been improvements since the investigation commenced and that the service was proactively reviewing and improving processes. The Commission was satisfied that the concerns had been satisfactorily dealt with, and requested to be kept informed of future follow-up of internal reviews. The Commissioner collaborates with the Official Visitors and the Human Services Registrar on issues raised about disability services to ensure ongoing review and monitoring of the quality of services being provided to ACT community members. 32 ACT Human Rights CommissionStrategic Priority 3: enhance services and service delivery In 2018-19, the Discrimination, Health Services, Disability and Community Services Commissioner received 1,596 enquiries and 683 complaints. In 2018-19, we: handled 170 more enquiries than 2017-18 received 60 more complaints than 2017-18 finalised 561 complaints, an increase from 81 per cent to 88 per cent recorded a 7 per cent increase in client satisfaction with the complaint process compared with 2017-18. In 2018-19 the Commissioner's team undertook a range of community engagement and training activities to ensure people were aware of the Commission's complaints process and of the individual and systemic outcomes that can be achieved through effective complaint handling. The team focused on ensuring the process is accessible to vulnerable community members and this is reflected in an increase in complaint numbers across all areas. The Commissioner and her staff worked actively with members of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community and this was reflected in an increase in community members utilising the complaint process. Complaints from people who identified as Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander has continued to rise. Complaints made by Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander people made up 8.6 per cent of the total complaints received this reporting period.

Conciliation is an informal and accessible process in which Commission staff help parties resolve a complaint. The conciliation process is co nfidential. Conciliation outcomes may include an apology or statement of regret, explanation of the services provided, acknowledgement of issues with service delivery, or changes to a service provider's policies and procedures to improve the quality of service delivery. Parties can negotiate financial outcomes to reimburse costs incurred, associated future costs, or to compensate economic and non-economic loss and/or damage. Table 4: all matters received in 2018-19.

I also think a [Commission] complaint made the hospital take us/ the complaint seriously.Followed up well and the officer was understanding and communicated well in a very complex matter. No need for litigation, resolved in a timely and cost effective manner.Complaint process enabled the organisation to improve services based on the feedback provided by the Commission.I was very satisfied with the highly professional support from the HRC. The main benefit is to be listened to, so the issues can be addressed, analysed and legitimised in such a way that an outcome is t ransparent... justice has been done... a great feeling. A fair and practical process, with great input from an impartial facilitator. The supportive environment created an opportunity for open and honest discussion in a confidential manner. The face-to-face discussion with the hospital was very valuable and was only able to be done because of the role of the Health Complaints Commissioner and the C ommission.The conciliation process was very professionally facilitated which made the whole experience easier. Able to resolve the complaint without the need for formal legal proceedings, conciliation was respectful and outcome was very good.Feedback from clients about complaints process 34 ACT Human Rights CommissionHigh satisfaction with complaint handling The Commission measures satisfaction with its complaint process by asking parties to complete an evaluation form when complaints are closed. The high level of client satisfaction with the Commission's complaint handling in 2018-19 reflects the ongoing effort to streamline the process and focus on early resolution of matters. Parties to complaints provided positive feedback about the benefits of the Commission's complaints process. Health services ACT community members can make a complaint to the Health Services Commissioner about any health service provided in the ACT, including public and private health services, individual practitioners and health services provided in settings such as aged care facilities, supported accommodation and schools. The Commission's health service complaint process provides parties a chance to resolve a complaint through informal alternative dispute resolution processes. The complaint handling team responded to 600 health service related enquiries and received 451 health service complaints. Of these complaints, 289 were made directly to the Health Services Commissioner, Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA) notified the Commissioner of 150 new matters and the ACT Veterinary Surgeons Board notified the Commissioner of 12 new matters. Figure 1: health service complaints 2015-2019. Of the 289 health complaints received by the Commission in 2018-2019, the majority of the primary issues raised in the complaints were about treatment. This includes inadequate treatment, care and/or consultation, incorrect or delayed diagnoses, delays in treatment, rough and painful treatment, inappropriate treatment, and unexpected outcomes to treatment. Communication issues were also a common cause for complaint to the Commission. Table 5: health complaint issues.

Health Directorate Number Total 147 Justice Health 51 Canberra Hospital 50 Mental Health ACT 23 Calvary (Public) Hospital (including Clare Holland House)15 Other (including ACT Ambulance Service) 3 Community Health 2 Dental 2 University of Canberra Public Hospital 1 The Commissioner received 64 complaints related to private sector organisations. Of these, 20 were in relation to a service provided by a general practice, 13 in relation to private hospitals, and 7 in relation to dental practices. The remaining related to other health services, including imaging, laser skin clinics, pharmacy, psychology and aged care facilities. Individual providers were named in 78 complaints: 55 were medical practitioners, seven were dental practitioners, five were psychologists and three were nurses/midwives. The remainder related to other professions involved in health service delivery, including pharmacists, physiotherapists and chiropractors. Working with the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency Complaints can be made about any registered health practitioner such as medical practitioners, dentists, nurses and midwives, chiropractors and psychologists. The process is managed under a co-regulatory model with the AHPRA and national boards of the fifteen registered health professions. Every health profession in the ACT that is part of the National Registration and Accreditation Scheme is represented by a national board. While the primary role of the boards is to protect the public, the boards are also responsible for registering practitioners and students for their professions, as well as other functions.AHPRA supports the national boards in their primary role of protecting the public and works with the Health Services Commissioner to deal with complaints about individual registered health practitioners. The Health Practitioner Regulation National Law (National Law) requires national boards and the Commissioner to jointly consider how to action complaints against registered health practitioners. The boards and the Commissioner jointly decide whether to investigate a practitioner, take regulatory action against a practitioner or close a complaint with no further action. While the complaint process requires joint consideration of matters with the Commissioner, only national boards can take regulatory action against individual health practitioners, such as imposing conditions, requiring a performance assessment or referral to a tribunal to deregister a practitioner. Practitioners can appeal reviewable decisions to ACAT. In November 2018, Paramedicine became a regulated profession under the National Registration and Accreditation Scheme (National Scheme). As with other registration boards, matters about paramedics will be managed under the co-regulatory model with the Health Services Commissioner, AHPRA and the boards. AHPRA can refer matters to the Health Services Commissioner if the matters are about issues outside AHPRA's jurisdiction, such as issues related to systemic concerns about a health service, rather than about the conduct of an individual registered practitioner. In 2018-19, AHPRA referred 11 matters to the Commission. The Commissioner can also refer matters to AHPRA, such as where a matter raises serious concerns that may warrant immediate regulatory action. The Commission referred nine matters to AHPRA. The Commissioner and AHPRA jointly considered 298 matters in 2018-19. Each matter may require multiple joint consideration decisions before it is finalised. The Commissioner jointly considered 410 decisions with AHPRA in 2018-19. Immediate action was taken against practitioners in 11 matters. Immediate action may include suspension of a practitioner's registration pending further investigation or a health assessment, or conditions imposed on the practitioner's registration including supervision or restrictions on prescribing certain medications. The Commissioner and the boards jointly decided health assessments were required in two matters in 2018-19. In 2018-19, the Commission closed 197 matters about individual registered practitioners. 36 ACT Human Rights CommissionACT Veterinary Surgeons Board The Commissioner also handles complaints about veterinarian services in the ACT under a co-regulatory model with the ACT Veterinary Surgeons Board. Twelve new veterinary matters were received and nine veterinary matters were closed in the reporting period. During 2018-19 the Commissioner worked with the ACT Veterinary Surgeons Board on the development and implementation of the V eterinary Practice Act 2018 which came into effect in December 2018. The Commissioner also worked with the Board on a complaints review committee and met with the Board to discuss how the commission's conciliation process may be better utilised in the resolution of veterinary complaints. The Commissioner will continue to work with the Board to ensure streamlined implementation of the co-regulatory model for managing complaints about veterinarians in the ACT.Table 7: health service complaints, individual practitioner, final outcome.

Conciliation is an informal and accessible process in which Commission staff help parties resolve a complaint. The conciliation process is con fidential. Conciliation outcomes may include an apology or statement of regret, explanation of the services provided, acknowledgement of issues with service delivery, or changes to a service provider's policies and procedures to improve the quality of service delivery. Parties can negotiate financial outcomes to reimburse costs incurred, associated medical costs, or to compensate economic and non-economic loss and/or damage.Health case studies Case studies assist the community to understand the types of issues that arise from complaints brought to the Commission and how those matters may be resolved. Complaints are generally dealt with on the basis there has been no admission of liability. Our role is to assist the parties where possible to resolve the matters. Cases following have been de-identified to ensure the privacy and confidentiality of the complaint handling process.Finalised health services complaints 226 health service complaints made directly to the Commissioner were closed in 2018-19. Table 8: finalised health services complaints.

The Commission liaised with ACQSC to ensure there was a coordinated approach to dealing with all of the issues raised. The ACQSC placed sanctions on the facility, and a clinical advisor was appointed. In response to the issues dealt with by the Commission, the facility also modified or developed new systems to improve residents' access to external health care providers. The facility also reviewed its advance care directive (ACD) process. All current ACDs were reviewed to ensure they were unambiguous and reflected the resident's wishes. CASE STUDYInadequate surgical follow up A woman complained about the treatment she received after surgery for a broken ankle. She claimed her treatment led to adverse health outcomes. She said she was not booked for relevant reviews and the review of post-operative images did not identify that she needed further treatment. The woman obtained a second opinion from a private orthopaedic specialist, who performed further surgery on her ankle. The Commission sought an independent clinical review of her care which confirmed that further treatment including additional surgery should have been by the hospital. The hospital and the woman participated in conciliation. The hospital agreed to provide an apology, reimbursement of costs and a review of the systems in place for outpatient care.CASE STUDYCommunication at time of adverse events A matter was referred to the Commissioner by the ACT Coroner in relation to the circumstances of a woman's death during a medical procedure. The woman's family also raised concerns about poor communication, overcrowding of the clinical area in which the procedure took place, a lack of availability of relevant equipment and poor support and assistance with mobility following the procedure. The family were also concerned about inadequate support and grief management from the hospital following her death. The hospital and the medical practitioner were invited to provide a response to the concerns raised and the Commissioner sought an independent clinical review in relation to the medical practitioner's conduct and performance. The Medical Board and the Commissioner found that while the outcome was tragic, the practitioner's conduct did not fall below reasonable standards for a practitioner in the circumstances. It was determined that relevant precautions were taken and although rare, the outcome was a known complication of the procedure. The hospital and the family attended a conciliation conference to try to resolve the matter. The parties were able to reach agreement about a number of outcomes including: linking the family with therapeutic services, using the complaint to inform training across relevant clinical teams and a review of current practices regarding medical and nursing students' participation in clinical procedures. 39 Annual Report 2018-19 National Code of Conduct for National Code of Conduct for Unregistered Health Care Workers The aim of the National Code of Conduct for Unregistered Health Care Workers is to protect the public by setting minimum standards of conduct and practice for all unregistered health care workers providing health services. The Code sets national standards against which disciplinary action can be taken and, if necessary, a prohibition order issued where a health care worker's continued practice presents a serious risk to public health and safety. The Health Services Commissioner continued to collaborate with Australian health complaint commissioners in the other states, in the Northern Territory, with ACT Health and the Victorian Department of Health and Human Services on implementing the Code in the ACT. The Commissioner continued to contribute to related activities, including developing a common framework for nationally consistent data collection with annual performance reports to the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) health council. ACT Health undertook public consultation on the Code in 2018 with a view to progressing the implementation of the Code in the ACT. CASE STUDYPharmacy dispensing errors A woman lodged a complaint about a pharmacy after they incorrectly dispensed medication to her that belonged to another consumer. She advised that she took the medication and suffered an adverse reaction. The Commission sought a statement from the pharmacist on duty and notified AHPRA. The parties attended a conciliation conference where they were able to reach agreement on a number of outcomes which resolved the complaint. The outcomes included an apology, changes in dispensing practice and financial compensation. The Board and the Commission jointly considered the matter and decided to take regulatory action against the pharmacist. CASE STUDYCo-ordination of health care A son lodged a complaint about the health care provided to his mother prior to her death. The issues included infection control, alleged delay in diagnosis, communication with family, transfer to palliative care and delay in patient transport. The parties attended a conciliation conference where explanations and apologies were offered to the son, and the parties agreed to resolve the matter. The health care provider undertook to provide further training to nursing staff about the specific issues giving rise to the complaint. The health care provider also committed to providing the son with an update on the progress of the implementation of the outcomes agreed to in conciliation. 40 ACT Human Rights CommissionDiscrimination In the discrimination jurisdiction, the Commissioner's role is to handle discrimination complaints, promote equality, examine systemic discrimination concerns and provide community education and information about rights under discrimination law. The Commissioner also handles sexual harassment, victimisation and vilification complaints and exemption a pplications. The Discrimination Act is very broad, covering many areas of public life (including employment, education, access to premises, accommodation, clubs and goods, services and facilities) with a wide range of protected attributes. The Commissioner works with community members, organisations and government to build awareness of the rights and obligations under discrimination law and participates in a range of community events, information sessions and committees to promote compliance with discrimination laws and a safe, inclusive and diverse community. In 2018-19 we collaborated with A Gender Agenda (AGA) to develop two resources for gender diverse employees and employers supporting staff transitioning in the workplace. These resources provides accessible, practical advice for employees and employers. They are available on the Commission's website. Discrimination complaints There were 406 discrimination related enquiries in 2018-19, up from 353 last year. The Commission also received 31 human rights related enquiries. While the Commission does not have the jurisdiction to handle human rights complaints, these enquiries often relate to equality rights which may be handled as a discrimination complaint or inform systemic, policy or litigation work. There were 166 discrimination complaints lodged with the Commission during the reporting period. The Commission has started to receive a small number of complaints about alleged discrimination on the basis of being subjected to family or domestic violence, accommodation status and immigration status which were added to the list of attributes protected under the legislation in 2017. The Commissioner continues to work with community groups and legal services to increase the understanding and awareness of these new attributes. A discrimination complaint can be made on more than one ground and made about more than one area of public life covered by the Discrimination Act. 41 Annual Report 2018-19 A joint Commission-AGA resource for employers. 42 ACT Human Rights CommissionTable 9: grounds in discrimination complaints.

Conciliated discrimination cases Case studies, such as the following, assist the community to understand the types of issues that arise in complaints brought to the Commission and how those matters may be resolved. Complaints are generally dealt with on the basis there has been no admission of liability. Our role is to assist the parties where possible to resolve matters. Cases below are de-identified to ensure the privacy and confidentiality of the complaint handling process.CASE STUDYAccommodation status discrimination A person alleged accommodation status discrimination, as they lost the home they shared with their partner, when their partner died. The person had not been listed on the tenancy agreement. They also alleged that they lost all of their possessions when the housing provider cleared the property. The matter was resolved in conciliation. The housing provided agreed to assist the person find new accommodation, to provide financial compensation and an apology to the person. The housing provider also reviewed its approach to residents who are not on tenancy agreements 45 Annual Report 2018-19 ACT Civil and Administrative Tribunal referralsCASE STUDYSchool adjustments for student with a disability A parent complained that their child's high school was not consistently following an agreed strategy to assist with the child's behaviour and that in one incident they were physically restrained by staff. The person said their child still felt scared at school because of that incident. The parent also complained that their child was teased and bullied at school for identifying as Aboriginal. The complaint was accepted as a children and young people service complaint, as well as a discrimination complaint on the grounds of race, disability and physical features. The complaint was resolved through early conciliation. The school agreed to organise a full learning assessment for the child, and to coordinate supports to maximise learning engagement and uphold cultural rights. This included strategies to minimise sensory disruptions, access to school counselling, and working with the Ngunnawal Bush Healing Farm for emotional and cultural wellbeing.CASE STUDYWorkplace discrimination A young woman lodged a complaint of disability discrimination, sexual harassment and victimisation against her former employer. The employer denied the allegations of disability discrimination and victimisation and claimed that the alleged sexual harassment was not in connection with the complainant's employment. The complaint resolved with an agreement that the employer would provide the woman with an apology, financial compensation of $7,000 and return property the employer still held. CASE STUDYDelays in housing repairs A person in a housing property alleged that significant repairs were required to their property and were not carried out for a number of years because they are Aboriginal. The state of the house was allegedly causing health issues for the residents. The matters resolved at conciliation with the housing provider agreeing to undertake the repairs.CASE STUDYRace discrimination in education A parent complained that their child who is Aboriginal has been subject to racism at school. The family were concerned about the manner in which the school had dealt with the issues of racism. The matter was resolved in conciliation. The school agreed to introduce Indigenous awareness training, review its policies and practices, improve complaint handling processes, improve anti-discrimination policies and provide ongoing support for the child. 46 ACT Human Rights CommissionIn the discrimination jurisdiction, the Commissioner's role is to consider and try to resolve complaints through conciliation. If a complaint is not resolved at conciliation, CASE STUDYReasonable adjustments in accommodation A mother made a complaint on behalf of her adult daughter with a disability. The mother said that her daughter requires ducted air-conditioning, but after moving to a new home this had not been provided. At conciliation the accommodation provider agreed to install ducted air-conditioning, provide disability awareness training for staff and review their policies around consultation with carers of people with disabilities and the provision of air-conditioning. CASE STUDYDisability adjustments in education A woman complained that she was refused reasonable adjustments for her disabilities by a tertiary education provider making it difficult for her to complete her course. The complaint was resolved at conciliation with the educator agreeing to an extension of time to complete required work, a change of supervisor and change of focus in her review topic.CASE STUDYDisability discrimination in employment A man alleged that he was discriminated against on the ground of his disability following an offer of employment which was subsequently withdrawn. The man believed he was able to do the job but the company told the man he needed to have surgery before they would employ him. After lodging the complaint the man received an offer of work from the company as a contractor but this did not progress. The man then alleged there was a connection between making the complaint and not receiving an offer. He re-lodged his complaint, adding an allegation of victimisation. The matter was subsequently resolved at conciliation through the payment of $7,000 in financial compensation.CASE STUDYRace discrimination accessing health services A woman alleged that a health clinic discriminated against her in the way they spoke to her on the basis of her Aboriginality. The complaint was conciliated with the respondent agreeing to provide Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultural awareness training to all clinic staff. The clinic also acknowledged that staff could have been more sensitive in the communication, apologised to the woman for any distress and developed new billing procedures to minimise the potential for future miscommunication. CASE STUDYRace and immigrant status a barrier to education A woman complained that her children's public school proposed to charge her an enrolment fee because of her visa status. The complaint was resolved through conciliation with the department agreeing to reconsider the request for a fee waiver and also take into account the financial circumstances of the family.CASE STUDYDisability a barrier to accessing housing A mother made a complaint on behalf of her son alleging disability discrimination due to him having spent a lengthy period being homeless despite being on the public housing list. The complaint was resolved at conciliation with agreement to provide suitable housing to the son. 47 Annual Report 2018-19 ACT Civil and Administrative Tribunal referrals In the discrimination jurisdiction, the Commissioner's role is to consider and try to resolve complaints through conciliation. If a complaint is not resolved at conciliation, the complainant can ask the Commission to refer the matter to ACAT for a decision about whether or not unlawful discrimination occurred. The Commission referred 19 complaints to ACAT in 2018-19. When a matter is referred to ACAT the parties may elect to try and resolve the matter through mediation at ACAT. There following decisions were made in the discrimination jurisdiction in ACAT in 2018-19. Cheluvappa v University of Canberra, November 2018 The applicant, a third year student enrolled in the Bachelor of Nursing degree at the University of Canberra, alleged that he was discriminated against by an incident that occurred while he was undertaking the 2017-18 summer intensive clinical placement at the National Capital Private Hospital. The applicant alleged that the incident involved a registered nurse making a false accusation about his conduct which resulted in the grade for this component of his degree as NX fail ACAT decided the respondent had discharged the onus on it and established that the applicant had no arguable case. The applicant's application of discrimination was dismissed. After referral of his complaint to ACAT, the applicant introduced claims of victimisation to his complaint. This claim was based on the allegation the respondent was not willing to participate in conciliation; and the respondent asking some of its personnel to not correspond or communicate with the applicant in relation to his claims before ACAT. ACAT formed the view at the hearing that these complaints of victimisation against the respondent and its legal representative were misconceived. ACAT also stated that the respondent was entitled to decline to participate in conciliation. ACAT dismissed the claims. Complainant v Education Directorate, January 2019 The applicant claimed that the Education Directorate (ED) declined to grant him an interview for a teaching position because he was an older candidate. He submitted that the discrimination may have been because of his age generally, but also, may have been motivated by the fact, as an older candidate, he was more experienced and ED's salary advancement rules would have entitled him to be paid a higher starting salary than a younger, less experienced candidate. ACAT considered submissions on whether the decision to not advance an individual's application for employment could amount to unfavourable treatment. ACAT decided it was satisfied that a failure to advance an applicant's application to interview can amount to unfavourable treatment under the Discrimination Act. However, ACAT was satisfied that the unfavourable treatment was not due to the applicant's age. ACAT accepted that although unfortunate for the applicant, the round of recruitment was competitive and that he was unsuccessful only because his experience did not match that sought by the respondent. The complaint was dismissed. Complainant v Transport Canberra and City Services, December 2019 The applicant alleged that she had been subject to discrimination, sexual harassment and victimisation in relation to her employment. The complainant also raised claims of race and age discrimination. ACAT noted that the applicant added additional grounds to her complaint during the proceedings; but that neither ground of discrimination had been raised in her complaint to the Commission. Therefore these were not matters that ACAT could consider. In relation to the allegations of age and race discrimination, ACAT did not believe that there was any causative link between the complainant's race or age and the alleged unfavourable treatment by the respondent. ACAT decided that it was satisfied that the three alleged events of sexual harassment do not constitute sexual harassment. ACAT was not satisfied that the respondent engaged in unlawful discrimination, sexual harassment or victimisation and the application was dismissed. 48 ACT Human Rights CommissionJohnston v Ainslie Football Club, October 2018 The applicant alleged disability discrimination when issued with an exclusion notice from clubs operated by the respondent at which he was a social member and a contractor who stocked vending machines. ACAT accepted the applicant's evidence that he has a disability including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), an acquired brain injury following a car accident and anxiety. However, ACAT noted that in the absence of more specific evidence, it was unable to find that the applicant's behaviours were \"symptoms or manifestations\" of his disability. ACAT found that the notice was not issued because of the applicant's disability and therefore the applicant was not discriminated against by the respondent. ACAT also found that the applicant was not victimised. ACAT considered the application of the exception in the Discrimination Act for acts done under statutory authority. It noted that the notice had been reviewed by the ACT Gambling and Racing Commission and had been revoked. ACAT found that, given the notice was revoked, issuing it was not an act done under statutory authority. It also noted that the defence for acts done under statutory authority should not be used to justify otherwise discriminatory acts in circumstances where the statute had not been complied with. Disability and community services The Disability and Community Services Commissioner has responsibility for handling complaints about services for older people, disability services and services for children and young people in the ACT. In 2018-19 the Commissioner continued a proactive community engagement program to raise the Commission's profile as a complaint handling body in these specific areas of service delivery, and to inform people of the Commissioner's role. This includes events in Seniors Week at local libraries, community information sessions about MyHealthRecord, participation on the Retirement Village Review Committee, community information sessions about complaint handling processes and working directly with key sector stakeholders to ensure information about the Commissioners functions are easily available to the community. One of the key challenges that people with disabilities face in the ACT is knowing how to speak up when health services don't meet expectations. In 2018-19, the Health Services, Disability and Community Services Commissioner collaborated with ACT's People with Disabilities (PWD) to produce a resource that supports people with a disability to self-advocate for higher-quality health services. Together, we mapped existing complaints and dispute resolution pathways into a one-page visual resource; and an easy English version of the resources. Both are available on PWD's website. The Commissioner continued to work with the Human Services Registrar and the National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) on transition to the NDIS and the establishment of the NDIS Quality and Safeguarding Commission (QSC) in the ACT. From 1 July 2019, complaints about NDIS providers occurring will be made to the new QSC. We will continue to handle non-NDIS disability service complaints. 49 Annual Report 2018-19 A health advocacy poster developed for people with a disability. 50 ACT Human Rights CommissionDisability services complaints During the 2018-19 period the Commission received 47 enquiries, and 21 new complaints: 19 complaints were about community sector providers two complaints were about government providers. the principal issues raised in the complaints were about accommodation support and home help the Commission closed 22 complaints relating to disability services. The table below shows the reason for closure for each co mplaint. Table 13: complaints relating to disability services. Closure reasonNumber of Complaints Total complaints closed 22 Commission given a reasonable explanation, no further action6 Complaint considered to Commission's satisfaction5 Complainant failed to take reasonable steps to resolve complaint3 Conciliation is unlikely to succeed 3 Complaint has otherwise been resolved 2 Complaint successfully conciliated 2 Made by someone who cannot complain under this Act1CASE STUDYInadequate communication by disability services provider A woman complained on behalf of her son about a disability service provider's case management, decision making and communication with the family. She also complained about the service's responses to her complaint. The Commission invited the parties to attend an early conciliation conference to discuss the issues of concern, where they reached agreement about resolving the complaint. The woman found the explanations provided by the service provider were satisfactory and helped clarify processes. The service provider also committed to changes in complaints handling that would address the concerns the woman raised and improve service delivery.CASE STUDYDiscontinuation of service contract A father said that his adult daughter received daily care services from a disability service provider. The provider discontinued the service contract with his daughter, and indicated they were no longer able to provide care services. The father complained about poor communication, last minute changes to staff, delays in pick-ups or drop offs and inconsistencies with scope of service provision. He also raised concerns about how the decision to terminate services was communicated and managed. The Commission facilitated resolution of the complaint by way of conciliation. The service provider offered a letter of apology to the man's daughter. The provider also committed to changes in communication and grievance processes. The service was due for an audit for accreditation by an external third party and committed to providing feedback to the father directly on any system improvements made in this process. 51 Annual Report 2018-19 National Disability Insurance Scheme The Commission continued to receive a small number of complaints against the NDIA. One of those complaints was referred to ACAT at the request of the complainant. The complainant alleged unlawful discrimination against the NDIA on the grounds of disability in the area of provision of goods and services. The ACT Attorney-General intervened in this matter. The Attorney-General argued that the Discrimination Act is capable of operating concurrently with the National Disability Insurance Scheme Act 2013 (Cth), and that the Commonwealth NDIS Act does not exempt the NDIA from protections against discrimination under the Discrimination Act. The matter is yet to be fully heard before ACAT. A question of law regarding jurisdiction has been referred by ACAT to the ACT Supreme Court. Complaints about services for older people The Commissioner's jurisdiction includes considering complaints about services for older people. Complaints may be about: organisations providing specialised services for older people and their carers such as retirement villages, personal and home-care services and respite care care support workers, such as people providing personal and home care assistance, home maintenance or transport community support organisations providing services, such as food services, advocacy or employment. In 2018-19, the Commission received 24 enquiries about services for older people and received two complaints. It should be noted that in some cases complaints from older people have been dealt with in other complaint jurisdictions, such as age discrimination complaints or health or disability services complaints. From 1 July 2019, the Commissioner will have a specific jurisdiction for complaints about retirement villages which will enable us to accept complaints, try to resolve them through conciliation, and, where resolution is not possible, the complainant can now make a direct application to have the matter considered and determined by ACAT. Complaints about services for children and young people The Disability and Community Services Commissioner deals with complaints about services for children and young people. Complaints may involve any service provided to children and young people, including education, sport, child protection, out of home care (OoHC), disability services such as respite or transport services, child-specific health services such as mental health services, and youth justice. During the reporting period, the Commission received 75 enquiries relating to services for children and young people. The Commission received 43 complaints about services provided to a child, young person or their carer. This is a significant increase from the 21 complaints received the previous year.

The grandparents were already approved carers for a step brother of the young girl, but were refused kinship care of their granddaughter. The Commission was advised that the decision-makers weighed the benefits of the child being cared for within her biological family against her attachment to her foster carers, given the length of time she had been in their care, and on review concluded that it was in her best interests to not disturb her attachment to her foster carers. The Commission was unable to resolve the complaint as all avenues of internal review had been exhausted by the grandparents, who considered that the only other option of pursuing the matter through the courts would be unlikely to provide a timely resolution for them.CASE STUDYPriority enrolment area A parent lodged a children and young people services complaint and accommodation status discrimination complaint on behalf of their child who had applied to enrol in a selective program at a school outside of their priority enrolment area (PEA). The child successfully passed the examination for the program, but was later informed he could not be enrolled as they resided outside the PEA. The parents subsequently leased a house in the PEA to allow their child to be enrolled in the selective program. At conciliation, the ED agreed to clarify information on the school's website to clearly communicate their position on accepting enrolments of students residing outside PEAs. The ED also undertook to seek feedback from affected ACT schools so that schools could raise any needs or concerns.CASE STUDYFinancial support for informal care arrangements The Commission received a complaint from a grandmother who had been caring for her four grandchildren. While the fulltime placement of the children with their grandmother was supported by government authorities, she was advised she was not eligible for any financial assistance in relation to caring for her grandchildren because there were no court orders in place. While the Commission understands there is no legislative barrier to the provision of financial and other support to children in informal care arrangements, the Commission was unable to resolve the complaint due to the agency maintaining its position that it would not provide financial support to the grandmother as there were no court orders in place and the grandmother did not wish to initiate court processes to address the issue formally. 53 Annual Report 2018-19 Submissions Submissions Minimising bullying and violence in schools The Commissioner provided a submission to the Standing Committee on Education, Employment and Youth Affairs on the complaints and other feedback the Commission receives in relation to bullying or occupational violence within ACT schools. The submission noted that the Commission has received a small number of complaints which raised issues of bullying in a school context, in addition to other related issues such as discrimination on the grounds of disability, physical features, and race. Complaints about bullying can also raise other related issues such as not being provided appropriate or adequate, reasonable adjustments for a disability and other elements of alleged unfair treatment of students. In the Commission's experience, parents generally raise concerns through our complaint processes where they are dissatisfied with the nature of the response provided by the school to the alleged bullying. This can be due to a slow response by the school; a transactional approach to a particular incident of bullying rather than considering a pattern of behaviour or investigating and dealing with the cause of the behaviour or conflict; insufficient weight given to the impact of bullying on a child due to factors such as race, colour, sexual orientation or disability that are attributes protected by discrimination law; and because of the particular barriers to achieving equality of treatment which those characteristics create. Complaints made to us by members of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community raise concerns that complaints about bullying on the grounds of race are not treated with the necessary gravity; and students are required to shake hands and make up. This does not address the source of the behaviour, can lead to repeated bullying at school and frustration on the part of the parents and family. Our experience is that while schools may have a well- developed anti-bullying policy or strategy, they do not necessarily highlight the specific issues that can arise for students who may experience bullying or like behaviours due to race, colour, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity and characteristics particularly protected by the Discrimination Act. It is also our experience from complaints we have received that students may be disciplined for responding to bullying or vilification on the basis of these personal characteristics, while the initial behaviour is not acknowledged or given equal weight which can be a significant concern for students and families. CASE STUDYSporting club disciplinary process A parent complained about a local sporting club's disciplinary process in response to their primary school-aged child being subject to a formal tribunal process and having their tribunal record published. The parent complained of inadequate supervision and umpiring which allowed verbal abuse and racist slurs towards their child to continue during the game. Although the national body for the sporting club declined to participate in a formal conciliation, they agreed to the Commission's facilitation of a discussion regarding the parents' concerns and their proposals for resolution. The national body advised that their tribunal guidelines had been reviewed to ensure that players under 14 years are not required to attend a tribunal hearing and can be represented by a parent or guardian; that tribunal results of players under 16 years would not be published; and that the local sporting body would increase their focus on umpire training and the application of existing rules to deal with abusive language. The national body also agreed to arrange a meeting between the parents and local officials to discuss the parents' concerns, particularly regarding players not being subject to racial and other abuse on-field. 54 ACT Human Rights CommissionOur Booris, Our Way review The Discrimination, Health Services, Disability and Community Services Commissioner provided a submission to the Our Booris, Our Way review of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children and young people in the child protection system in the ACT. This submission was informed by complaints made to the Commission in relation to CYPS (CSD); and by the responses received from CSD to those complaints. The submission focused on the following issues, with a view to reducing the number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in care: the provision of financial support for all kinship carers; the review of policy guidance provided to decision-makers; the provision of unconscious bias training and public authority obligations training; better accountability mechanisms for CYPS staff; increased review rights for CYPS decision-making; and funding for Aboriginal community controlled organisations to provide early support to families. The submission also considered some ways in which the experience and outcomes of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children and young people could be improved while they are in care, including: ensuring adequate resourcing to develop and implement cultural plans for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children and young people reviewing the numbers of long-term care and protection orders sought by CYPS where a child is under 5 years requiring OoHC providers to demonstrate compliance with s27(2) of the HR Act, including by providing housing and care that is culturally safe. It is vitally important that people and agencies involved in child protection understand their obligations with respect to human rights, rights to equality and non-discrimination and that decision making is scrutinised to ensure those factors do not contribute to less than optimal outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in the ACT. Inquiry into maternity services The Commissioner made a submission to the ACT Legislative Assembly inquiry into maternity services. The submission covered a range of issues raised in complaints and enquiries we receive. The Commissioner acknowledged the high standards of care provided in the ACT and the professional and caring services provided by the many people working in maternity services. The submission sought to contribute to the inquiry by highlighting issues that are relevant to a person's ability to resolve concerns about health services effectively and quickly through the Commission's conciliation service; and the limited access many people have to court due to potential costs and complexity of medical matters. The Commission's complaint handling process provides an avenue for quick, informal resolution for many matters, but the lack of incentive for some respondents to resolve complaints through conciliation can have the effect of forcing complainants to either abandon their claim or initiate court action. The Commissioner raised a concern that the strict privilege regime in the ACT that provides exceptional levels of confidentiality for a range of quality assurance committees is not reflected in other jurisdictions. The Commissioner also raised concerns about access to language and Auslan interpreters, communication and consent. A number of people have raised concerns with the Commissioner that some mothers have had child concern reports raised unnecessarily because they have a disability, or are from particular racial or cultural backgrounds. This process adds to the stress already associated with the birth of a child and reduces the mother's trust in the health service providers. Health services in the AMC The Commissioner made a submission to the Inspector of Custodial Services Healthy Prison Review . The submission highlighted concerns raised through complaints and enquiries about health services provided in the AMC including access to drug and alcohol programs, disability services and cultural issues that may disadvantage some within the AMC, based on race, gender and religion. 55 Annual Report 2018-19 Victims of Crime Commissioner Strategic Priority 2: Lead systemic change to address vulnerability Under section 11 of the VoC Act, the functions of the VOCC include: advocating for the interests of victims promoting reforms to meet the interests of victims encouraging and facilitating cooperation between agencies involved in the administration of justice with respect to victims advising the Minister for Justice on matters relating to the interests of victims. The VOCC is also appointed as the Domestic Violence Project Coordinator under the Domestic Violence Agencies Act 1986 and is responsible for facilitating cooperation between agencies providing health, crisis or welfare services to victims of family violence and people who perpetrate such violence. This work directly aligns with the Commission's strategic priority of leading systemic change to address vulnerability. Key projects undertaken by the VOCC to lead systemic change in 2018-2019 are outlined below. Victims' charter In August 2018, the VOCC led the Commission's response to the ACT Government's consultation on a charter of rights for victims of crime. The Commission's submission, available on our website , makes recommendations relating to the kinds of rights that should be included in a charter, the importance of a robust accountability framework and the need to ensure criminal justice agencies are resourced to deliver on their responsibilities. The VOCC continues working with Government to deliver a charter which upholds victim rights to information, support, privacy and a voice in the justice system. Intermediaries The Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse found that vulnerable witnesses with communication difficulties face significant barriers giving evidence about sexual assault. During the past year, the VOCC advocated strongly for the introduction of an intermediary program in the ACT to minimise trauma for vulnerable witnesses and ensure their best evidence is available to police and the courts. In June, the ACT Government committed $5.8 million over 4 years to establish an intermediary program in the ACT, to be administered by the VOCC. The funding will support the phased introduction of an intermediary scheme in certain offence matters, initially including child complainants in sexual offence matters and child witnesses in homicide matters Prior to that, in October 2018, the VOCC invited interstate colleagues to Canberra to share their experience of the NSW and Victorian intermediary programs. Attendees included District Court Judge Kate Traill, the NSW Commissioner for Victims Rights, Mahashini Krishna and representatives from NSW police, the NSW Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) and a NSW intermediary. Vicki Bahen, manager of Victoria's intermediary program also joined the discussion. The visiting team met with ACT ministers, presented at a forum for legal stakeholders and shared their experience with members of the judiciary at a meeting hosted by the ACT Chief Justice. The visit was an important opportunity to build understanding across the ACT of the role that witness intermediaries play in the criminal justice process. 56 ACT Human Rights CommissionHighlights: Victims of Crime Commissioner CULTURAL AWARENESS We are undertaking a range of cultural awareness training sessions so that our staff are better prepared to help people from diverse communities.MULTI-LINGUAL We are using technology so that our clients can access counselling in their own language.Cultural liaison officer This year we recruited a cultural liaison officer to help connect us with victims from Canberra's multicultural community. BETTER CONNECTED We are better connected to other front-line services to ensure assistance for our clients when needed. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander programCase coordinators worked with people to support their safety and provide access to counselling and other therapeutic supports. NAVIGATING THE CRIMINAL JU STICE SYST EM Clients were assisted to navigate the criminal justice system e.g. giving reports to police and giving evidence in court.Victim Services Team 1,698In 2018-19, the Victim Services Team helped people affected by crime. Volunteer program In 2018-19, our volunteers provided 259 hours of court support to 97 clients. Our volunteers provided 323 hours of help with the financial assistance scheme. Our volunteers also supported clients applying for family violence and personal protection orders. Our volunteers supported people through the criminal justice system, including: reporting to police attending court as witnesses completing victim impact statements. Financial assistance scheme 453 new applications received. 110 new payments made to help people in immediate need. 242 people received recognition payments to help them recover from crime.We help people recover from crime, recognising that everyone is different and may need different types of help. Our program has a team of three staff. We work to improve our clients' safety and their children's safety. We make sure that following a crime, our clients have the information and practical help they need when it comes to the justice system, including interacting with police, going to court and giving evidence. 57 Annual Report 2018-19 Presenters at an October 2018 intermediary legal stakeholder forum, program including Heidi Yates, ACT VOCC, (third from right). Family violence intervention program Commencing in 1998, the family violence intervention program (FVIP) was developed to coordinate the ACT's response to family violence incidents that come to the attention of police and proceed to prosecution. The FVIP aims to integrate the activities of key criminal justice agencies and stakeholders with a view to maximising victim safety. The VOCC chairs the FVIP coordinating committee which includes the following partner agencies: ACT Policing ACT DPP ACT Law Courts and Tribunal ACT Corrective Services Domestic Violence Crisis Service (DVCS) Legal Aid ACT Victim Support ACT (Secretariat) Canberra Rape Crisis Centre Coordinator-General for Family Safety JACS CYPS Health Directorate. During 2018-19, the work of the FVIP coordinating committee included: Undertaking a data collection exercise to identify the availability of in-person support to applicants for interim family violence orders. Exploring how new technology can better support the FVIP's weekly case-tracking of family violence matters. Streamlining information-flow to DVCS to ensure victims receive timely updates regarding court outcomes. Enhancing victim and first-responder awareness of the health risks associated with non-fatal strangulation through the development of resources for community and front-line workers. 58 ACT Human Rights CommissionAdvocacy for systemic change: submissions and board participation Other activities undertaken by the VOCC in 2018-19 to drive systemic change are listed below. Law reform and policy submissions The VOCC provided advice to the ACT Government on a broad range of issues including: The development of guidelines to support the roll-out of restorative justice processes to family violence and sexual offence matters. The development by ACT Corrective Services of a no contact list which allows victims to opt-out of being contacted by detainees at the AMC. The application of the ACT's spent convictions regime in the context of juvenile sexual offenders. Victim participation in the context of establishing the ACT's new Warrumbul Court which aims to provide culturally-appropriate sentencing options and reconnect young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Canberrans with their culture. Timely payment of victims' FAS awards under the old court-based FAS. Victim rights to consultation, in relation to the ACT Supreme Court's new approach to case conferencing.Boards and committees Domestic Violence Prevention Council: as a member of the Council, the VOCC contributed to the Council's ongoing work, including advocating for action regarding the needs of children and young people affected by family and domestic violence. The Council also established a long-awaited mechanism to ensure the views and experiences of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people can inform the Council's work. Victims Assistance Board: this year, the Board's work focused on the development of the charter of rights for victims of crime, including how the charter can improve agency responsiveness to the needs of people affected by crime. Sexual assault reform program (SARP): as a member of the SARP reference group, the VOCC provided advice regarding implementation of the criminal justice report recommendations from the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse. SARP also worked to improve processes and support for victims of sexual assault, including through VSACT's participation in monthly wraparound meetings to coordinate practical supports. Liquor Advisory Board: the VOCC's participation on the Board provides an important opportunity to advocate for the interests of victims of crime in the context of preventing and addressing alcohol-fuelled violence. National victims of crime working group: the group comprises representatives from each state and territory. In 2018-19, the group met to share expertise in the provision of front-line victim services and provided advice to COAG regarding nationally consistent guidelines to protect the rights of victims of terrorism. 59 Annual Report 2018-19 Strategic Priority 3: Enhance services and service delivery The Commission's vision is an inclusive community that respects and realises everyone's rights. One way we strive to achieve this is by delivering accessible services that empower and support people affected by crime. Crime can have crippling effects on a person's life including their health, their sense of security, their work and their relationships. These impacts often extend to a person's partner, children, parents, friends and support networks. VSACT front-line services aim to ensure that people whose lives are impacted by crime can access help quickly and sensitively. We work with police, prosecutors, community and government services to understand and respond to the needs of each client. VSACT's four frontline services for community members and their families are outlined below. Service one: victim services' scheme The victim services' team: provides eligible victims of crime with therapeutic interventions, such as counselling, to aid their recovery from the impacts of crime works with clients using a case coordination model to restore their health and well-being and work towards recovery provides advocacy and assistance in supporting clients to navigate the criminal justice system. The victim services' team includes the specialist Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander program; and a cultural liaison officer. These staff members work to ensure service is accessible and responsive to everyone in the Canberra community. Service two: financial assistance scheme FAS is designed to help victims, their families and carers recover from the impacts of violent crime. The scheme facilitates payments to eligible victims to meet emergency costs and pay for practical services and supports that aid recovery. The scheme can also makes recognition payments to victims in acknowledgment of the harm and trauma caused by violent offences. Service three: court support VSACT's court support program is delivered by highly skilled, trained volunteers who help victims of crime navigate the court system. Court support volunteers provide practical information and assistance to individuals attending the ACT Magistrates Court, the ACT Supreme Court and the ACT Civil and Administrative Tribunal. Service four: resolving concerns about the criminal justice system Under the VoC Act, the VOCC must try to resolve any concern raised by a victim about how they have been treated by a criminal justice agency such as ACT Policing, the ACT DPP or ACT Corrective Services. The Commissioner and her team work with individuals and their families to clarify concerns, gather information and resolve concerns quickly and informally. Further information about the work VSACT has undertaken in each of these four areas in the 2018-19 financial year follows. Further information about our services is also available on the VSACT website, which had a total of 53,823 page views in 2018-19. 60 ACT Human Rights CommissionVictim services scheme The victim services scheme (VSS) is established in part four of the VoC Act and operates in accordance with the Victims of Crime Regulation 2000 . VSACT recognises that the impact of crime varies widely. Our team works closely with a range of community and government agencies to ensure people affected by crime have a choice of supports and can access help in ways, and at times, that work for them. Many people who experience violent crime do not seek help immediately, perhaps only approaching a service like ours years after the event. This is particularly so in childhood sexual abuse matters. Importantly, no time limits apply to seeking help under the VSS. The victim services team provided 1698 victims of crime with assistance in 2018-19. This figure includes: provision of ongoing case coordination to 1,051 people including new clients, ongoing clients and past clients who have experienced another violent crime one-off assistance to 624 clients including advice, information and referral to another service. This year, the victim services team have implemented changes to our client service model to increase the timeliness and flexibility of our response. We have also sought to maximise client choice and control in relation to when and how we provide support. Our team is now working intensively with clients at the point of initial contact, ensuring they are aware of the different ways we can help and providing options for support via our cultural liaison officer and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander program. We work closely with partner agencies including through weekly FVIP case-tracking meetings and monthly sexual assault wraparound meetings to ensure family violence and sexual assault victims receive timely support. In the first quarter, the team closed a significant number of long-term files, with an assurance to clients that they could re-contact to request further support at any point. We then directed our resources to servicing a 30 per cent increase in new clients seeking case coordination. We are proud to report that this year, the victim services team has responded to 99.8 per cent of clients within 5 days of initial contact or referral. This timely offer of service resulted in a significant (43 per cent) reduction in the number of clients who declined our support upon initial contact. Whilst the overall increase in clients assisted this year appears to be small (up 4 per cent from 1,634 in 2017-18 to 1,698 in 2018-19) the 30 per cent increase in new clients registered for case coordination reflects a substantial increase in workload. When registering a new client, case coordinators work intensively with individuals to offer a range of service options and individualised support, ensuring people can access urgent assistance if required.CASE STUDYCounselling & court support for Maryam Maryam was referred to VSACT by police in mid- 2018 after being sexually assaulted by her ex-partner at a colleague's home. VSACT contacted Maryam to offer her a range of services. Maryam chose to access urgent crisis counselling to prepare emotionally for the challenges of the upcoming trial. The VSACT volunteer coordinator matched Maryam with an experienced court support volunteer, Chris, who met Maryam at court a week before the trial to walk her through a court orientation. Chris then supported Maryam at a meeting with the DPP and sat with Maryam for three days whilst she gave her evidence from a remote witness room. Chris also attended court with Maryam on the day the jury handed down their finding of guilt. VSACT ensured Maryam could access regular counselling appointments after each court appearance so she had therapeutic support throughout the court process. Prior to sentence, VSACT assisted Maryam to prepare a victim impact statement and liaised with the DPP on her behalf. Chris then attended the sentencing hearing with Maryam and supported her to read her victim impact statement from a remote witness room. A few months later, when Maryam felt she was ready, VSACT booked Maryam an appointment with a trained volunteer to complete a victims of crime FAS application. Once lodged, the FAS assessment team provided Maryam with regular updates about the status of her application before awarding her a recognition payment and reimbursement of the wages she lost when she took unpaid leave from work to attend court. Maryam continues to receive regular counselling through VSACT. 61 Annual Report 2018-19 Client testimonialsCASE STUDYFeeling safe after a crime Sarah contacted VSACT following an assault by her ex-partner at her home. Sarah spoke to a case coordinator about her safety concerns, should her ex-partner come back to the house. Sarah agreed that the case coordinator could speak to police about her safety. The case coordinator also made a referral to have Sarah's home assessed for security upgrades so that Sarah and her three-year-old daughter, Olivia, felt safer at home. Sarah did not feel she could remain in her home long-term and decided to apply for a Housing ACT property. She was supported through this process by her case coordinator, who provided a letter in support of Sarah being placed on the priority housing list. As part of her ongoing safety-planning, the case coordinator provided Sarah with a referral for legal advice. A court support volunteer subsequently attended court with Sarah when Legal Aid assisted her to apply for a family violence order. Sarah was worried about attending court on the day as she had no family support to care for Olivia. Her case coordinator assisted her to find emergency child care assistance from children services for her court dates. Sarah had concerns about feeling isolated after leaving the relationship and moving into her ACT Housing property. Her case coordinator supported her to link-in with her local child and family centre to start attending playgroup. This empowered Sarah to establish new networks for herself and her daughter, as well as receiving emotional and therapeutic support through counselling provided by VSACT.\"I wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for services like Victim Support ACT. The work that you do and the support that you provide is tremendous. It has helped me emotionally and physically knowing that you were right there through this with me.\" \"You really improved my day by giving me so much important information.\" 62 ACT Human Rights CommissionTable 17: victims of crime provided with assistance under VSS 2015-16 2016-17 2017-18 2018-19 9 Clients provided with case coordination services New clients registered for case coordination 374 327 404 524 Existing clients with new episodes of victimisation 51 24 6 6 Existing registered clients with ongoing service needs 508 413 630 521 Clients provided with information and/or referred to other services Advice, information or referral 239 479 429 544 Referral received; client declined service 160 151 140 80 Out of scope/inappropriate referral 45 19 25 23 Total 1377 1413 1634 1698 Clients unable to be contacted 138 193 207 186 Figure 2: sources of referral to VSACT. 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700ACT Policing and SupportlinkSelfFamilyDomestic violence crisis serviceDPPWraparound program - sexual offencesProfessionals & community organisations Referral sources Self-referral continues to be the primary way that victims of violent crime initially connect with our service.

Highlights: financial assistance scheme 26. . . . . . . 67 Annual Report 2018-19 Financial assistance scheme Completing its third year of operation, the victims of crime FAS is now an integral part of VSACT's work. 2018-19 was the third consecutive year of increased client demand. This reflects growing community awareness of the scheme, driven by our team's community outreach and strong stakeholder connections. The increase delivers on a key objective of the ACT Government's 2016 overhaul of the FAS: to increase accessibility and deliver assistance to more eligible victims in need. In 2018-19 community members lodged 453 new FAS applications. This is a 16 per cent increase in applications compared to the total number received in 2017-18 (392 applications) and a 319 per cent increase compared to 2016-17 (108 applications), the scheme's first year of operation. The community outreach work undertaken by VSACT's new Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander program has driven greater engagement with the scheme. Fifteen per cent of applications received in 2018-19 were from Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander applicants, up from 10 per cent in 2017-18. Applications from people with disabilities have also increased, up from 3 per cent in 2017-18 to 6 per cent of all applications.

Since then, he has undergone multiple surgeries to repair nerve damage to one of his arms and requires ongoing financial assistance to pay for monthly pain medications, doctor and specialist appointments. The injuries have had a significant impact on William and his family. He has not been able to return to work and has difficulties completing day-to-day activities like getting dressed, preparing dinner and driving a car. FAS continues to support William as he adjusts to the permanent changes in his life due to the assault. 68 ACT Human Rights CommissionImmediate needs payments Immediate need payments are intended to help victims of crime with urgent expenses as prescribed by the Victims of Crime (Financial Assistance) Regulation 2016. Applications can be made for assistance with the cost of cleaning a homicide scene, personal security (for example, changing locks or installing security screens), relocation for personal security (including removalists or storage units), emergency medical costs and related services that contribute to recovery. During 2018-19, there were 110 payments made to, or on behalf of, 69 applicants, totalling $127,774. Compared to 2017-8, this was a 134 per cent increase in the total number of payments made and a 92 per cent increase in the total number of applicants who received assistance to meet immediate needs.

FAS was designed to complement other victims of crime services and incorporate direct payments to providers as well as reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses after receipt of rebates, for example, from Medicare, private health funds or workers compensation. In 2018-19, there were 163 economic loss payments totalling $165,287. In comparison to 2017-18, this includes a 238 per cent increase in the overall amount paid for counselling or psychological support expenses and a 62 per cent increase in the overall amount paid to reimburse victims, their parent or carer for loss of actual earnings.

Payment amounts are prescribed by the Victims of Crime (Financial Assistance) Regulation 2016 and amounts can be increased to acknowledge the effects of serious injury, the circumstances in which the act of violence occurred or the vulnerability of the victim. There were 215 recognition payments made in 2018-19, totalling $892,512. Compared to 2017-18, this was a 95 per cent increase in the total number of payments made and a 108 per cent increase in the total amount paid made in the form of recognition payments.

Under the 1983 Act, victims could apply for recognition payments, known then as special assistance payments, where they had experienced certain sexual offences or had suffered an extremely serious injury. In 2016, the 1983 Act was repealed and replaced by the VoCFA . Section 203 protects the rights of victims to apply for recognition payments if they experienced certain sexual offences, or suffered an extremely serious injury, prior to 1 July 2016. There are two different recognition payments that can be made under Section 203. Certain sexual offences If an applicant was injured after 1 July 1983 and prior to 1 July 2016 due to a sexual offence listed in sections 51 to 62 of the Crimes Act 1900 , they can receive a recognition payment of up to $50,000. Of the total number of applications for a recognition payment received in 2018-19, 12 per cent related to sexual offences that occurred prior to 1 July 2016. In 2018-19, there were 27 recognition payments made under Section 203, totaling $1,349,275. 71 Annual Report 2018-19 Table 22: recognition payments under section 203 by offence type 2018-19.

There were no payments made in 2018-19 for extremely serious injury under section 203 of FAS Act. Funeral expenses A person is eligible to apply for a funeral expense payment if the person has paid, or is required to pay, the costs of a funeral for a primary victim who has died as a result of homicide. In 2018-19, four payments were made, totalling $23,291 for funeral assistance. In comparison, in 2017-18, four funeral assistance payments were made totalling $11,701. Review of Victims of Crime Commissioner's decisions Applicants can request an internal review of decisions made under FAS. In 2018-19, the VOCC undertook seven internal reviews, confirming four decisions and setting aside three decisions. Following internal review, applicants may apply to ACAT for external review of a decision. In 2018-19 there were two applications for external review. One application resolved at mediation and the other application was dismissed. Court support volunteer program VSACT's volunteer court support program is delivered by highly skilled, trained volunteers who help victims of crime navigate the court system. (See p67 for an overview of support provided by volunteers.) The program is administered in accordance with the VOCC functions under section 22(j) of the Victims of Crime Regulation 2000. Support provided by volunteers includes: Court orientation and familiarisation with court processes and court etiquette. Support at meetings with the ACT DPP and ACT Policing. Support when giving evidence in the courtroom and remote witness rooms and at sentencing hearings. Support to attend family violence and protection order return conferences and hearings. Help to complete FAS applications and to draft victim impact statements. Research and administrative support to the VOCC and the FAS team. CASE STUDYRecognising the harm of violent crime Linda was sexually assaulted as a child, resulting in serious psychological injuries including depression and anxiety. In the years following the assault, Linda required extensive counselling and periods of hospitalisation to manage her symptoms. Supported by her legal guardian, Linda provided a statement to the police about what happened to her. However the matter did not proceed to court. Linda received the maximum amount of FAS under section 203 of the FAS Act in recognition of the harm she experienced as a victim of violent crime 72 ACT Human Rights CommissionThe VSACT volunteer coordinator provides volunteers with tailored support and de-briefing. Volunteers also have the opportunity to participate in: Ongoing training: volunteers attended a range of training and information sessions in 2018-19 to further their understanding of the criminal justice system and better support clients. Volunteer quarterly meetings: these meetings provide an informal opportunity for volunteers to meet, debrief and share their experiences over lunch. Community engagement: volunteers continue to support the Commission to run stalls and outreach activities at major community events including 2018 NAIDOC family day and the 2019 National Multicultural Festival. Client feedback about volunteer support \"Thank you for the support the volunteer provided when I attended the Magistrate's Court for a family violence matter. The volunteer was a really calming influence and it meant so much to have someone with me while I waited, and who was patient with me and knowledgeable of the process/system. I understand she is a volunteer, which makes her contribution and help even more special, given she invested her own time to meet me, a complete stranger, and help. It really made a significant difference to me both going into court, during and after to have had their support.\" VSACT volunteers and staff.Volunteer profile: Vicky Newman Vicky Newman was already volunteering with Rowing ACT and Contact ACT when she saw an ad on a volunteer website about supporting victims of crime. The registered nurse, who had worked in accident and emergency and in public health and science research, said she wanted to do something which was different to her professional background. Five years later, she is still going strong as a VSACT volunteer. Vicky accompanies victims to court when they are giving evidence, seeking a protection order or a family violence order. Many of the cases involve sexual assault. She practices active listening and is ready to be a sounding board if people want to talk. \"That's completely up to them,\" she says. When victims are giving evidence, the support of a volunteer can be particularly invaluable. If victims are in the court's remote witness room, friends or family may not be allowed in the room, but a volunteer can often accompany them. Vicky says that sometimes, a victim's evidence might be confronting and they simply don't want friends or family to hear it. While working as a VSACT volunteer \"can be very emotional... it's not for everyone\", it's also rewarding. \"I really do feel as though I am doing something of value, and it's a privilege to be able to help someone in crisis.\" 73 Annual Report 2018-19 Raising concerns with the Victims of Crime Commissioner The VOCC has an obligation under the VoC Act to monitor and promote compliance with the Act's governing principles which state how victims should be treated in the administration of justice. The VOCC must also try to resolve any concern raised by a victim who believes they have been treated by a criminal justice agency in a way that breaches the principles. Under the VoC Act, the VOCC has broad information-gathering powers which require criminal justice agencies to provide her with information that is \"reasonably required\" for the VOCC to resolve a concern. In exercising these responsibilities, the VOCC: Assists people to assess and clarify problems they have experienced in their engagement with the criminal justice system and communicate these concerns directly to criminal justice agencies such as ACT Policing, the ACT DPP, ACT Courts and Corrective Services. Facilitates communication between victims and criminal justice agencies with the aim of resolving victim concerns. Recommends systemic improvements to the criminal justice system based on problems identified by victims. The VSACT team assists many clients to resolve minor concerns with criminal justice agencies in the course of providing case coordination, financial assistance, advice and information. During 2018-19, the VOCC also worked directly with over 60 clients who had concerns about breach of the governing principles in the context of matters including: Victim concerns about the impacts of court delays, including where victims have waited long periods before the handing down of judgements. Liaison with the ACT DPP to facilitate victim access to further information regarding sentencing decisions and lost opportunities to submit a victim impact statement. Advocacy where offenders continue to harass and threaten a victim while in custody. Advocacy to Housing ACT for housing options that will maximise victim safety. Advocacy for ex gratia payments where victims cannot otherwise access compensation or financial assistance. Liaison with media to maintain the privacy of victims. Liaison with courts regarding non-payment of reparation orders and clarification of enforcement processes for victims. Liaison with courts and the Public Trustee and Guardian (PTG) about administrative delays in funds being paid into trust in the context of FAS applications made under the old court-based scheme. Appearing in ACAT matters to communicate the views of victims where an offender has been found not guilty of a serious violent crime by way of mental impairment. 74 ACT Human Rights CommissionEnhancing service delivery across the community Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander program In February, the ACT Government announced its Building Communities Not Prisons project which aims to reduce reoffending, reduce the prison population, improve the lives of individuals involved in the criminal justice system and their families, and improve community safety. The project funded the employment of two additional staff to improve access and support for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who have been victims of crime. The VOCC used this funding to establish a permanent, specialist Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander program within VSACT. The program builds on the hard work of Tanya Keed, who has been leading VSACT's work with local community since September 2017. The three-person program team includes Aboriginal victim liaison officers, Tanya Keed and Brenton White, and victim support social worker, Barbara Knight. The team is working with individuals in a family and community context to improve safety and support healing. The team has undertaken extensive awareness-raising, community engagement and relationship building with the local Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community to raise the profile of VSACT's services. They also provide intensive case coordination and advocacy for individuals who are carrying the effects of crime-related trauma when navigating the justice process, including the criminal justice and child protection systems. On a day-to-day basis, the program uses a community outreach model to provide clients with advocacy, information, access to trauma counselling, help applying for financial assistance, facilitation of complaints to the Commission on related issues such as discrimination or health concerns and therapeutic group work in the form of yarning circles. In addition to their work in the community, the program team works as part of the Building Communities Not Prisons project in the AMC to support Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who have been subjected to violent crime. Research shows that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in corrective services facilities have often been subjected to violent crime, including domestic and sexual violence, as have many non-Indigenous people. Victimisation, particularly childhood abuse, can result in complex trauma, the effects of which can be central features of pathways into offending. Unaddressed trauma can also negatively impact a person's capacity to engage in rehabilitation programs and/or post-release support aimed at reducing recidivism. By responding to their experience of violence, the program team are assisting individuals to identify and recover from trauma, progress their rehabilitation, and reduce the likelihood of future contact with the criminal justice system. CASE STUDYBeginning to heal from violence & trauma Aaron is an Aboriginal man who has spent many years in and out of the AMC for a variety of offences. Aaron was subjected to violent crimes throughout his childhood for which he received little support. While Aaron tried to re-establish his life outside of prison, each time he left the AMC, he found it difficult to obtain employment and access culturally appropriate support services. Liaison officers from VSACT's new Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander program met regularly with Aaron in the AMC. The team organised ongoing counselling and support for Aaron which assisted him to identify and begin to heal from his own experiences of violence and trauma. Aaron participated in rehabilitation programs and when he last left the AMC, the team facilitated support for him from culturally appropriate services. Aaron has now been out of custody for several months. His work provides him with a sense of purpose and he is working to assist other Aboriginal men to integrate back into community after being in prison. 75 Annual Report 2018-19 Figure 6: VSS Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander clients 020406080100 Total Unspecied Male Female This year VSACT's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander program assisted 126 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander clients. Working with culturally and linguistically diverse communities Factors such as language barriers, limited social networks and uncertain migration status make some members of culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) communities more vulnerable to crime. In addition, members of these communities are often less likely to report crime and seek help to aid their safety and recovery. In March this year, VSACT employed its first cultural liaison officer (CLO), Zouheir Dalati, with the goal of making our services more accessible to members of CALD communities. The CLO provides a safe initial point of contact for clients from migrant, refugee and asylum seeker backgrounds and is working to raise awareness of, and trust in, VSACT services across CALD communities.Mr Dalati has undertaken extensive awareness raising, community engagement and relationship building with the ACT multicultural community to help VSACT facilitate appropriate services, programs and events. The CLO has also taken a lead role in creating a culturally-responsive work and client environment, providing staff and service providers with training to ensure we can better meet the needs of clients from diverse cultural backgrounds. The CLO undertakes weekly outreach, offering VSACT services at the multicultural hub and other locations across Canberra. The CLO is also working to increase client access to counsellors with diverse language skills. VSACT's counselling rooms now provide clients with the option of accessing counselling with interstate providers via audio-visual link where there isn't a local provider who speaks the client's preferred language, or the victim has privacy concerns about accessing a local counsellor. 76 ACT Human Rights Commission One of the staff from the Discrimination, Disability and Health Services Commissioner team paints the face of a young participant at an International Refugee Day afternoon tea in June 2019. Strategic Priority 4: Increasing community engagement The VOCC and the VSACT team take a strategic approach to our engagement with community and front-line services across the ACT. We aim to improve community awareness of our services and to hear from individuals and families about their experiences of the criminal justice system. VSACT also regularly engages with key community organisations to build efficient referral pathways for clients whose lives have been affected by crime. This year, we delivered presentations to agencies including: ACT Disability, Aged and Carer Advocacy Service ACT Council of Social Service Belconnen Community Service Beryl Women's Refuge Canberra Hospital Nurses CatholicCare CYPS Students at Daramalan College ACT DPP DVCS Legal Aid ACT Migrant and Refugee Settlement Service Multicultural Hub Northern Region Network Onelink Quest Solutions Relationships Australia. The VSACT team also participated in community events including the 2019 Multicultural Festival; ACT government market day for domestic violence support services; Reconciliation in the Park 2019; and sponsored the Stand against Family Violence soccer tournament coordinated by Canberra's African communities. 77 Annual Report 2018-19 Public Advocate and Children and Young People Commissioner PACYPC's oversight framework In accordance with the PAYPC's statutory responsibility, the PAYPC promotes a robust, preventative and comprehensive system of independent oversight for vulnerable groups in the ACT. Oversight of services and systems draws upon the various functions within our statutory remit to develop, maintain and improve our line-of-sight about the way in which these services and systems operate. OVERSIGHTINDIVIDUAL ADVOCACYSYSTEMIC ADVOCACY AND REVIEW INVESTIGATIONS AND REVIEWS INSPECTIONS AND VISITS COMPLIANCE MONITORINGSERVICE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPROVEMENTPARTICIPATION AND ENGAGEMENT 78 ACT Human Rights CommissionIndividual advocacy Wherever possible, the PACYPC undertakes individual advocacy with a forward focus to promote and ideally secure a response that upholds an individual's rights, promotes the development and implementation of appropriate protections/safeguards, and takes the views of the person into account in decision-making. Systemic advocacy and review Systemic advocacy is focussed on facilitating improvements to service delivery and/or encouraging the development of new programs or services to benefit particular client groups. Systemic review functions also include providing feedback on cabinet submissions, and providing or seeking advice (e.g. through consultation) for the purpose of influencing legislative change or policy reforms. Investigations and reviews The PACYPC may undertake an investigation or review as a component of broader inquiries into particular aspects of service delivery for an individual or systemically. This may include investigating individual or systemic concerns referred to, or identified by, the PACYPC; thematic reviews of a particular area of service provision across a sector or facility; or targeted reviews examining an individual's or group's particular experience of service provision. Inspections and visits Visits that involve attending facilities or organisations to meet with service users, and inspections that involve a systemic and more rigorous examination of facility administration and standards provide the PACYPC with a unique understanding of, and insight into the safety and wellbeing of the cohorts we represent. Visits can be announced or unannounced, both with benefits. Compliance monitoring The HRC Act, the CYP Act and the MH Act provide a legislative mandate for the PACYPC to undertake a compliance monitoring role with respect to services for the protection of children and young people, and for services provided to people experiencing mental health issues in the ACT. These functions seek to ensure government meets its statutory responsibilities. Complaints handling Although the PACYPC does not have legislated responsibility for complaints handling, referrals are often made across the Commission (for example, when the outcome being sought from a complaint may be better facilitated through public advocacy). The PACYPC can also support people to submit a complaint to the Discrimination, Health Services, Disability and Community Services Commissioner. Service development and improvement In performing its statutory oversight functions, the PACYPC's functions enable the identification of practices that may constitute human rights breaches, maltreatment and systemic abuse. This assists in evaluating the quality of supports and services, and the wellbeing of people accessing them. The PACYPC uses information gathered through preventative oversight mechanisms to inform service providers about issues they may not have known about, or had overlooked. Participation and engagement The PACYPC promotes the rights, interests and wellbeing of all people experiencing vulnerability by ensuring opportunities to genuinely seek and listen to the views of clients and stakeholders, and carefully considering these views to inform our work in meaningful and empowering ways. The PACYPC also promotes awareness in the ACT community about the importance of taking these views into account and the value that the contributions of service users can make to service delivery and policy reform. 79 Annual Report 2018-19 Strategic Priority 1: Make human rights relevant to everyone In 2018-19, the PACYPC actively sought opportunities through which to support enhanced understanding by community members about their rights and obligations under the HR Act, and about the role of the Commission. In addition to engaging regularly with community members and professionals about how ACT laws, policies, services and programs could be improved for children and young people, and with people whose condition or situation makes them potentially vulnerable to abuse, exploitation or neglect, the PACYPC collaborated with agencies to foster service improvement, consider policy reform, facilitate information sharing and promote practice improvements. The PACYPC facilitated or contributed to numerous discussions seeking to improve human rights outcomes for ACT citizens, including the Commission's UNDRIP anniversary film screening in September 2018. (See p121, UNDRIP anniversary.) At the request of community groups and other stakeholders, the PACYPC also undertook the targeted engagements described below, to raise awareness of human rights. Gold Creek Primary incursion On 10 August 2018, the PACYPC presented to year 6 students at Gold Creek Primary as part of their unit of learning about government systems, how these affect human rights and our responsibilities as global citizens. The presentation and facilitated discussion provided information about human rights within international, national and local contexts, including what happens when human rights are not upheld and how others can help. The session also provided an opportunity for the children to raise and discuss social justice matters of interest to them. Young women's march, Mother Teresa Primary School As part of an initiative generated and driven by two passionate young students, Maria and Chloe, the PACYPC participated in, and was invited to be the guest speaker for, a young women's march on 7 September 2018 to raise money for the One Girl charity supporting girls who don't have access to an education. In her speech, the PACYPC spoke about article 28 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, the right to education.Association of Independent Schools ACT leadership breakfast On 13 September 2018, the PACYPC was the guest speaker for the Association of Independent Schools of the ACT leadership breakfast. The PACYPC spoke about the leadership traits that are inherent in children and young people and what can be learnt about leadership from them. The address also recognised the important role that teachers play in enacting the right to education; the right of children and young people to be engaged about issues impacting their own lives; and information we gain by doing so. ACT Together foster and kinship carer appreciation event On 13 September 2018, the PACYPC presented the opening address at the ACT Together foster and kinship carer appreciation event recognising the important role that foster and kinship carers have in caring for and supporting the wellbeing of the children and young people in their care. In her speech, the PACYPC spoke about the importance of belonging and the right of children and young people to be protected and to participate in decision-making about their own lives. ACT Youth Assembly The PACYPC had a chance opportunity to provide an impromptu speech at the ACT Youth Assembly on 28 September 2018. The PACYPC reflected on the messages that had been presented by the young people in their closing remarks, in particular the points that were made about how we can better support civic participation by children and young people. In her address, the PACYPC noted that children and young people constitute approximately one quarter of the ACT population making the point that they therefore represent an important and significant stakeholder group, and have the right to have their views heard and acted upon. 80 ACT Human Rights CommissionRadford College Junior School children's rights interview On 12 October 2018, the PACYPC was interviewed by four young men from Radford College Junior School on the premise that imagination is more important than knowledge. The group was looking into how politicians use their imagination to influence the masses. The students asked a range of questions about imagination versus knowledge, while also querying the participation rights of children and how the PACYPC tries to get politicians to listen to children and young people. St Vincent de Paul's national youth advisory committee The PACYPC supported the St Vincent de Paul's national youth advisory committee (NYAC) to enhance their understanding of children's rights and advocacy practice as part of their advocacy masterclass series on 20 October 2018. The PACYPC began the session with a presentation about children's rights, particularly in respect of protection and participation, and also spoke more broadly about the role of the Commission and of the PACYPC. NYAC members were keenly interested in the PACYPC's work and, more specifically, on how they can more actively advocate for children and young people. Gold Creek Primary School social justice interviews On 25 October 2018, the PACYPC was interviewed by four children at Gold Creek Primary School about how the media influences the social issues including children's rights, childhood obesity and racial inequality. The children asked a range of questions about the rights and laws that are potentially relevant to their social issue. Blue Gum Preschool, children's and cultural rights On 29 October 2018, the PACYPC joined Blue Gum Preschool's 3-5 year old class as part of their community classroom initiative in which they were exploring civic participation. The PACYPC provided information about her role and also spoke with the children about children's rights and cultural rights. The children had many questions and were keenly engaged with the role they can play in supporting diversity within both their classroom community and the broader community. Senior Practitioner seminar series On 2 November 2018, as part of the ACT Senior Practitioner's seminar series, the PACYPC provided a presentation about children's rights as they relate to reducing and eliminating restrictive practice use in care and protection settings. In her presentation, the PACYPC highlighted the rights from the HR Act that are potentially engaged in respect of using restrictive practices with a child or young person. Supported decision- making in healthcare The PACYPC participated in a panel discussion on 23 November 2018 focused on the challenges surrounding the application of supported decision-making in healthcare settings, particularly given issues such as duty of care, dignity of risk and informed consent. Panel discussions canvassed considerations from the perspectives of rights, law, capacity and dignity. Commonwealth family law reform panel discussion On 26 November 2018, the PACYPC participated in a panel discussion exploring family law reform issues, with a particular focus on user-centred design. The PACYPC commented on the rights of children and young people to have their views heard, and the importance of ensuring that this right is supported through the review. In support of this, she also made the point that children and young people should be involved in policy reform directly and that their views should guide the direction of the reform insofar as it relates to how children and young people engage with family law processes. Occupational violence in schools panel discussion The PACYPC was invited to participate in a panel discussion as part of the Education Directorate's national occupational violence in schools workshop on 21 March 2019. In her comments, the PACYPC articulated the positive obligation to make reasonable adjustments to facilitate the right to education and the need to enact the right of children to additional protections by virtue of being a child. The PACYPC also supported the important role that restorative approaches can play to addressing and responding to occupational violence in schools, noting that any potential solutions will require whole-of-community engagement and action. 81 Annual Report 2018-19 Strategic Priority 2: Lead systemic change to address vulnerability Contributions to policy development and systemic reform Boards and committees In 2018-19, the PACYPC was a member of numerous boards and committees with responsibility for effecting policy development and/or systemic reform. The PACYPC's contribution to these discussions was focussed on ensuring appropriate regard for human rights and the furthering of systemic change that would lend itself to improved outcomes for persons experiencing vulnerability. The committees through which the PACYPC sought to facilitate these objectives follow: Chair, Children and Young People Oversight Agencies Group (CYPOAG) Co-chair, Blueprint for Youth Justice taskforce Bimberi Oversight Group Royal Commission Working Group Australian Guardianship and Administration Council (AGAC) Australian and New Zealand Children's Commissioners and Guardians (ANZCCG) Official Visitor's Board Children and Young People Death Review Committee Department of Defence Youth Safe Advisory Board Department of Defence Joint Cadet Executive Board AMC Oversight Agencies Group Family Matters Strategic Alliance National Coalition on Child Safety and Wellbeing Countering Violent Extremism Steering Committee Inter-Directorate Committee for Mental Health and Wellbeing Restrictive Practices Oversight Steering Group 1800Respect National Sector Advisory Group Disability Justice Reference Group Early Childhood Strategy Inter-Directorate Committee Meeting National 'Best Practice Child-Focussed Complaints Guide' forums Official Visitor Scheme Working Group Hoarding Case Management Group Local Drug Action Team Supported Decision-Making Group Integrated Service Response Program Governance Group AMC Oversight Group Elder Abuse Prevention Network Seclusion and Restraint Working Group Some notable areas of focus for the PACYPC throughout 2018-19 follow. Children and Young People Oversight Agencies Group CYPOAG includes the ACT Ombudsman, the Human Services Registrar, Legal Aid ACT, Official Visitors and Commission staff from the teams of the President and Human Rights Commissioner, the Discrimination, Health Services, Disability and Community Services Commissioner, and the PACYPC. The CYPOAG has continued to focus its activities on targeting systemic themes and trends emerging from joint discussions and analysis by the group's members, notably the opportunities and challenges associated with facilitating effective interventions and outcomes for children and young people in the ACT who have complex high-level needs. In 2018-19, information about engagement with, and service responses for, children and young people with complex high-level needs was used to inform a gap analysis of the current service system. The CYPOAG's exploration of effective intervention models for children and young people with complex high-level needs was also informed by the PACYPC undertaking site visits to relevant service offerings in New South Wales and Victoria. Australian and New Zealand Children's Commissioners and Guardians ANZCCG comprises national, state and territory children and young people commissioners, guardians and advocates. ANZCCG aims to promote and protect the safety, wellbeing and rights of children and young people in Australia and New Zealand. ANZCCG strives to ensure that the best interests of children and young people are considered in public policy and program development across Australia and New Zealand. 82 ACT Human Rights Commission Australian and New Zealand's Children's Commissioners and Guardians at their bi-annual meeting, held in May 2019 in Canberra. ANZCCG key priorities are: achieving better outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander and M\u00e3ori children and young people promoting children and young people's engagement and participation upholding the rights of children and young people in youth justice improving the safety of children and young people in organisations ending violence against children and young people promoting children and young people's safety and wellbeing. In May 2019, the PACYPC hosted the ANZCCG biannual meeting in Canberra. Ahead of the meeting, the PACYPC developed and distributed a survey for children and young people, asking their views on what the priorities for the ANZCCG should be. The PACYPC received 487 responses to the survey, of which nearly 75 per cent (364 survey respondents) were children and young people from the ACT. (See p126 ANZCCG survey.) ANZCCG members also attended a pre-screening of In My Blood It Runs , ahead of its Australian premiere at the Sydney Film Festival. The film, which told the story of 10-year-old Arrernte/Garrwa boy Dujuan, was both inspirational and thought-provoking, emphasising the challenges that underpin many of the ANZCCG's priorities. It also highlighted the importance and value of Indigenous-led solutions and self-determination. Australian Guardianship and Administration Council AGAC held a national conference in Canberra on 14-15 March 2019 with the theme of upholding rights, preventing abuse and promoting autonomy. The PACYPC was a member of the organising committee. The conference brought together international, national and local speakers and attendees from as far afield as Canada, Hong Kong, Korea and Singapore. The conference also showcased a raft of engaging presentations and panels on topics including: elder abuse supported decision-making the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) planning ahead - the impact, strengths and weaknesses of enduring instruments commentary on current guardianship and administration jurisdictions in Australia and proposals for reform the operation or observance of the UN Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities in guardianship and administration consent to medical treatment/end of life decision-making for people with impaired decision making ability. AGAC is also taking a lead role in a number of pieces of work advancing the Australian Law Reform Commission's (ALRC) elder abuse reform recommendations and in support of establishing a national plan to tackle the issue of elder abuse. In 2018-19, AGAC finalised an options paper for the Commonwealth Attorney-General's Department on facilitating national consistency in the laws concerning financial enduring powers of attorney throughout Australia and work on a national best practice resource for enduring appointments is well underway. In 2018-19, AGAC also finalised a report on best practice guidelines for maximising the participation of proposed represented persons in guardianship proceedings; and the national standards for financial managers. 83 Annual Report 2018-19 Systemic priorities Improved outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people In 2018-19, the PACYPC continued to prioritise improved cultural competency for agencies working with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children and young people. Cultural competency in care and protection The PACYPC continued to advocate both individually and systemically for improved practices in supporting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children, young people and families who come into contact with the care and protection system. For the second half of 2018, the PACYPC continued to facilitate meetings of key agencies supporting children and young people to promote opportunities and improvements in respect of the cultural competency of non-government service providers in the care and protection system. In 2018, this involved presentations and/or discussions about the following: justice reinvestment restorative practice family group conferencing Our Booris , Our Way youth circle sentencing (Warrumbul Court) Galambany Circle Sentencing reconciliation and its construction in Australian schools functional family therapy PCYC's services. In early 2019, meetings were discontinued in lieu of a developing a community of practice through which the group shares articles and resources useful to furthering practice development. This change has not been successful. In 2019-20, the PACYPC will explore how best to reinvigorate the focus on cultural awareness, competency and safety in relevant agencies.Improved outcomes for children and young people Child-safe, child-friendly organisations Advocating for child-safe, child-friendly organisations has remained a critical, ongoing priority issue for the PACYPC in 2018-19. While significant enhancements have been made in the ACT to improve the systems response to child neglect and abuse (including legislative reform, implementation of the Reportable Conduct Scheme, and the introduction of the National Redress Scheme), these are primarily justice responses. The PACYPC therefore commends the ACT Government's response to the Royal Commission's child safe standards recommendations and its investment in the employment of dedicated staff to scope the ACT environment and design the implementation strategy. The introduction and mainstream implementation of child safe principles/standards provides the foundation for a more preventative approach, recognising that participation by children and young people is, itself, a form of protection. The PACYPC is concerned to ensure that the evolution of child-safe practice in the ACT places equal emphasis on participation by children and young people, and on the development of child and youth-centric complaint processes. While there are existing resources for developing an institution's child safe practices, there are few resources to assist in developing child friendly practices. This will be the key focus of the PACYPC in supporting implementation of the Royal Commission's recommendations. To this end, in 2018-19, the PACYPC supported the ACT Government's exploration of sector readiness in respect of child safe standards by facilitating two stakeholder forums on 16-17 October 2018. The PACYPC also contributed to the development of a national practice guide centred on applying a children's rights framework to complaints handling. This work was led by the NSW Ombudsman, with the guide due for release in 2019-20. 84 ACT Human Rights CommissionIn 2018-19, the PACYPC also focused on building community capability and awareness in respect of child-safe, child-friendly practice and, particularly, child/youth participation. The PACYPC has held a series of capability development workshops with ACT Government staff. The workshops provided guidance for engaging children and young people in policy development and service reform, and responded to a number of the child safe standards/principles. They also promoted enhanced understanding about children's rights, enhanced capability for direct consultation with children and young people, and informed the development of child-safe and child-friendly approaches to engaging with children and young people. This work will continue in 2019-2020. Residential care environment assessment framework The PACYPC has a number of specific functions relevant to children and young people. Many of these responsibilities relate to the out of home care (OoHC) system in view of children and young people within this system representing some of the most vulnerable people in the ACT. Oversight of care and protection services includes monitoring residential care arrangements for children and young people. The PACYPC can visit any of the residential properties at any time to undertake inspections and assess the quality of care being provided to children and young people. Aligning with an interest in promoting the National Principles for Creating Child-Safe Organisations and the PACYPC's vision for a child-safe, child-friendly Canberra, the PACYPC has developed a residential environment assessment framework centred on the themes of children's rights, participation and empowerment. The PACYPC's consultation with children and young people in residential care in 2017-18 and the resultant report, It's Not What You Think It Is... - The Views of Children and Young People In Residential Care, which was published in October 2018, provide the basis of the framework. It is intended that the framework be used to conduct annual assessments of each residential care arrangement, with the outcomes of each assessment enabling increased understanding about the care being provided and whether there are any areas requiring enhancement or change. Drawing upon best practice guidelines, the outcome of each assessment will be fed back to ACT Together and to the children and young people residing in each property. The four governing principles for this framework are that it: is influenced directly by the views of children and young people living in residential care in the ACT aligns with the National Principles for Child Safe Organisations ensures appropriate performance of monitoring and oversights functions by the PACYPC is informed by a therapeutic trauma-informed approach. Blueprint for Youth Justice The pathways and supports available to children and young people who come into contact with the youth justice system is an ongoing priority for the PACYPC. The PACYPC continues to monitor the implementation of the Blueprint for Youth Justice in the ACT 2012-2022 , which adopts an evidence-based, trauma-informed and human rights compliant policy approach to youth justice in the ACT. In 2018-19, the PACYPC continued as co-chair of the Blueprint for Youth Justice Taskforce, which culminated in the Taskforce producing its final report for the ACT Government. The PACYPC acknowledges government and community progress in prevention and diversion of young people, although further work is needed to promote reintegration, ensure supports are in place for young people in the community, and to tackle recidivism. Local Drug Action Team initiative The PACYPC continued to work in collaboration and partnership with Directions ACT to establish a Local Drug Action Team (LDAT). Directions ACT are finalising the community action plan, which seeks to connect children and young people at risk of developing their own patterns of substance use with recreational, sports and capacity building programs to assist in preventing and reducing harm from alcohol and other drugs. The PACYPC will continue to support the project work associated with this initiative throughout the next reporting period. 85 Annual Report 2018-19 Learning from children and young people about domestic and family violence In partnership with the Family Safety Hub, the PACYPC is listening to the views and experiences of children and young people about domestic and family violence. We want to better understand children and young people's unique perspectives about what they need to be and feel safer, and how services can better respond to their needs. Insights gathered through this project will inform further work in the family safety team. The project began in 2018-19 with a literature review to ensure that the project doesn't duplicate what is already known. Work also commenced to co-design the project with young people, ensuring that it meets their needs and focusses on young people's priorities. An expert reference group was established to provide advice on all areas of the project. The reference group has a wealth of experience in family violence, children's experience of trauma, child-centred practice and research ethics, and will guide the project's design and implementation. Improved outcomes for people in contact with mental health/forensic mental health systems In response to issues identified in the course of undertaking monitoring functions, the PACYPC has intervened in numerous matters, both individually and systemically to improve systems and address concerns. Intervention by the PACYPC achieved a wide range of outcomes in 2018-19. Advocacy has addressed many issues including the need for more effective discharge planning for some consumers, improvements in activity programs in ACT's mental health facilities, and facilitating active participation by consumers and their families in their treatment, care and support both in the community and in inpatient units. The PACYPC is also actively advocating for a mobile library service to regularly visit mental health and forensic mental health inpatient units. This is currently being negotiated. As a result of concerns raised by the PACYPC, changes were made to restrictions put in place on people transferred to the Adult Mental Health Unit (AMHU) from the courts. Information packs about service provision in the AMHU were also provided to consumers on admission to AMHU, and the PACYPC continues to participate in the review process for seclusion and restraint. The PACYPC has also undertaken a collaborative venture with the Mental Health Consumer Network (MHCN), to improve uptake of the My Rights, My Decisions information kits, and has raised concerns about the lack of oversight of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) practices in the ACT's private mental health facilities. 86 ACT Human Rights CommissionSafewards project Safewards is an evidence-based clinical model developed in the UK to promote safer, less coercive practices in mental health care, and to reduce incidents of conflict involving consumers or staff. Safewards attempts to identify and address the causes of behaviours in mental health settings that may result in harm - such as violence, self-harm or absconding - and to reduce the likelihood of these behaviours occurring, thus increasing the safety of both staff and consumers. In 2016, the Victorian government supported the extension of Safewards to all public mental health services. The Victorian evaluation found Safewards was associated with significantly reduced seclusion events, and improvement was especially evident in adult and youth wards. In 2017, PACYPC staff attended a presentation on Safewards at the Embracing Change Through Innovation and Lived Experience Conference in Sydney, and subsequently began a project to explore bringing Safewards to the ACT. In July 2018, PACYPC staff engaged with key consumer groups in the ACT to seek representative views in relation to Safewards as a model of practice for reducing restrictive practices in inpatient units in Canberra. This was extremely well received and throughout 2018-19, the PACYPC worked together with the Mental Health Consumer Network (MHCN), Mental Health Community Coalition (MHCC), Carers ACT and the Discrimination, Health Services, Disability and Community Services Commissioner to advocate for the implementation of Safewards in the ACT. This collaboration sought leadership support from the ACT Government to introduce the Safewards initiative. In September 2018, the PACYPC met with Minister Shane Rattenbury to discuss the potential for the implementation of Safewards as a strategy to reduce the rates of seclusion, restraint and aggression in ACT mental health inpatient facilities. Safewards was subsequently consolidated by the Minister as part of ACT Health's new Nurses and Midwives: Towards a Safer Culture project. Further, it was decided that the initial implementation of the Dhulwa secure mental health unit (Dhulwa). The PACYPC is a member of Dhulwa's steering committee for the implementation of Safewards in their facility. In June this year, the PACYPC facilitated two forums to inform consumers, carers and ACT Health stakeholders about the benefits of implementing Safewards in mental health inpatient units. Associate Professor Bridget Hamilton from the University of Melbourne spoke at the forums, and two consumer academics provided a unique perspective about being an inpatient in a Safewards facility for mental health treatment. The Coordinator-General for Mental Health and Wellbeing, Dr Elizabeth Moore, and a project officer from Nurses and Midwives: Towards a Safer Culture also spoke at the forum. The PACYPC looks forward to the initiation of Safewards in the ACT and commends the ACT Government on its commitment to improving practice and promoting the rights dignity and safety of staff and consumers. 87 Annual Report 2018-19 My Rights, My Decisions The PACYPC collaborated with the MHCN to support their My Rights, My Decisions project, recognising it as a crucial source of mental health education for consumers. The toolkit at the centre of this project is made up of three important documents provided for by the MH Act and aimed at empowering consumers to record their views and wishes and have input into the management of their mental illness should they become unwell in the future. This is then uploaded to their electronic file for future reference. The My Rights, My Decisions education program brings together consumers, Legal Aid, and the PACYPC in a relaxed setting, providing consumers with the opportunity to ask questions and seek clarity about their legal and participation rights when navigating the My Rights, My Decisions documents. The PACYPC is further supporting this project by mailing My Rights, My Decisions information packs to consumers whose involuntary mental health orders have been revoked or allowed to expire. The PACYPC is uniquely placed to carry out this task as they receive notifications of all revocations of involuntary detention as part of their oversight functions. The mail out of these information packs provides consumers with the necessary information in a timely fashion, to promote their participation in decision-making in respect to their ongoing mental health treatment. Seclusion and restraint: young people in involuntary detention The PACYPC undertook a joint systemic project with the Discrimination, Health Services, Disability and Community Services Commissioner in response to concerns raised with the PACYPC about restraint and seclusion practices in the adolescent setting at the Canberra Hospital, where there appeared to be no clear guidelines or policy around these practices. The PACYPC noted that seclusions and restraints were occurring with no notification to the PACYPC as per legislative requirements. This intervention led to a child and adolescent mental health working group being formed for the purpose of ensuring a collaborative and co-ordinated approach to clinical practice, education and policy in the management of children and young people admitted involuntarily under the MH Act to the Canberra Hospital Paediatric Adolescent Unit. Policies, procedures and guidelines were subsequently developed to ensure the management of children and young people aligned with the MH Act. Education to staff was also delivered based on current evidence-based best practice. Current practices were reviewed to ensure the safety of staff, families, other patients, and consumers who are children and young people. The formulation of an action plan commenced in March 2019. The PACYPC is a member of a seclusion and restraint working group formed to provide expert advice to ACT Health's comprehensive care committee on processes and systems for promoting safety, reducing restrictive practice use, and reducing the risk of harm to patients where seclusion and/or restraint is clinically necessary and permitted under legislation. Improved outcomes for people with disability/complex needs Elder abuse The PACYPC is part of the ACT elder abuse prevention network and participated in meetings throughout 2018-19. Membership of this group enables the PACYPC to work in collaboration with other stakeholders in responding to elder abuse in a cohesive and integrated manner, and facilitates clearer pathways for the provision of necessary support, legal assistance and advocacy. During 2018-19, the PACYPC met with CSD's Office for Veterans and Seniors and a representative from JACS Legislation, Policy and Programs branch to discuss national reforms, responses to elder abuse in the ACT, and the role of different agencies. The PACYPC will continue to be actively involved in ongoing policy development and reforms occurring in relation to elder abuse to further facilitate a coordinated and integrated response. 88 ACT Human Rights CommissionCollaboration with the Public Trustee and Guardian and Office of Disability The PACYPC and the PTG meet monthly to discuss matters of joint concern, scope the potential for systemic projects, and to facilitate communication and referral pathways. This has been a particularly effective process when both agencies are working respectively on a matter involving a joint client. The PACYPC and PTG also attended some joint meetings with the Office of Disability, which enabled key concerns to be discussed, such as issues relating to the needs of clients with high and complex needs and the capacity of the NDIS to respond. The Office of Disability has been of assistance in liaison between the PACYPC and PTG, and the National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) in facilitating improved outcomes for people with intensive support needs. Management Assessment Panel The PACYPC coordinates the ACT Management Assessment Panel (MAP), a voluntary service that fosters the provision of services and facilities for people with complex and intensive support needs by coordinating case management and other service responses by relevant lead agencies. MAP is a service of last resort that exists to facilitate the coordination of case planning and service provision for people whose complex service needs are poorly coordinated or not adequately met. MAP accepts referrals for children, young people and adults with disability. (See also p109 Management Assessment Panel coordination.) The nature of cases referred to the MAP provide unique insights into the ways that the complex needs of some individuals can challenge service systems and their capacity to provide effective responses. The matters that were referred to 2018-19 included issues relating to a lack of suitable accommodation, poor or inadequate service/support coordination, and difficulties interacting with and negotiating service systems. Most individuals accessing MAP in this reporting period were NDIS participants, though one participant was an older person with an ACAT package of care. Proactive monitoring and oversight Children and young people Bimberi Youth Justice Centre In 2018-19, the PACYPC took the lead in advocating for and establishing a robust multi-agency oversight meeting for Bimberi. This involved liaison with relevant directorates, commissioners and inspectors involved in service delivery or who hold Bimberi oversight functions. There is now an agreed terms of reference and membership for this meeting, which is convened every two months and is chaired by the senior manager CSD. The group also includes the Bimberi director, the PACYPC, the Discrimination, Health Services, Disability and Community Serves Commissioner, Inspector of Correctional Services, ACT Ombudsman, Official Visitors, the operational director (custodial and community justice health services); and the director of student engagement. This forum provides an opportunity to encourage strong collaboration between Bimberi and the bodies tasked with oversight roles and functions. The focus of the meeting is on identifying systemic and thematic issues arising, or those that have the potential to arise. The aim is to facilitate continuous improvement in the delivery of services to young people in detention, including safeguarding their health, wellbeing, education and transition; and supporting their rehabilitation back into the community. This may also include joint projects and research possibilities. Responding to children and young people with complex high-needs The PACYPC remains concerned by the number of children and young people with extreme trauma behaviours or behaviours demonstrating a significant risk to themselves or others. The behaviours demonstrated by these children and young people are often extreme, suggesting serious issues requiring skilled intervention and treatment. The service response has been inadequate to meet these needs. Matters that have been brought to the PACYPC's attention suggest there are at least 10 children who currently meet this definition in the ACT. Importantly, this small group is inclusive of a number of children and young people who are currently not under the statutory responsibility of the Director-General, CSD or are under statutory responsibility, but are choosing not to live in their assigned placement/residence despite the associated risk. 89 Annual Report 2018-19 Notably, the PACYPC is aware of a number of young people who exhibit highly problematic and risk-taking behaviour including drug misuse and possible sexual exploitation, who are not receiving appropriate therapeutic care. The PACYPC brought the issue of service gaps to the attention of the CYPOAG in 2017-18. In response, the CYPOAG undertook a number of activities in 2018-19 to identify the current challenges and gaps in the ACT service system and explore options for an appropriate service response for children and young people with complex high-level needs. It is clear that there is controversy about the use of structured environments, particularly where discussion extends to the use of secure accommodation options. The PACYPC notes the divergent views people hold about whether the provision of therapeutic supports within such environments is appropriate for children and young people who have experienced significant abuse and complex trauma. Despite this, it seems that a small number of children and young people in recent years have been inappropriately confined in secure facilities such as Bimberi or adult mental health facilities without receiving the intensive therapeutic clinical support they required. The PACYPC is pleased to see that a more intensive therapeutic model is being utilised for one young person, and looks forward to this model being further developed and ideally that consideration is given to the appropriateness of implementing more flexible models for other children and young people with complex high-level needs.CASE STUDYYoung person with complex high-level needs Over the last 12 months there have been a number of well-documented cases relating to the absence of appropriate therapeutic placements for children and young people with complex high-level needs. These concerns arose in response to the experiences of young people who, in the absence of such placements, had been moved between secure facilities in both the adult mental health system and Bimberi. A bespoke arrangement, involving an intensive 3:1 staffing ratio, has now been put in place for one young person with complex high-level needs. The arrangement includes experienced staff familiar with supporting young people in youth detention as well as intensive psychological therapeutic input from the principal practitioner who guides and develops the therapeutic model and its delivery. This is a welcome advance in the area of therapeutic service delivery. It is hoped that it can be developed to respond to the larger cohort of young people with complex high-level needs. People with disability and complex needs In addition to participation in the Council on the Ageing (COTA) and Older Persons ACT Legal Service (OPALS) meetings, the PACYPC meets regularly with the Official Visitors for disability. Referrals to the PACYPC are instigated by both parties. The referrals made and the actions that follow generally involve a degree of complexity. The below case study provides an example of the PACYPC's intervention in such a matter. 90 ACT Human Rights CommissionPeople in contact with the mental health/forensic mental health systems Oversight mechanisms in mental health In providing oversight, the PACYPC seeks to remain abreast of developments in service delivery with a view to proactively identifying emerging themes or trends that may warrant further enquiry. To this end, the PACYPC and staff are involved in the following meetings: seclusion and restraint meetings at both AMHU and Dhulwa seclusion and restraint working group AMC oversight group AMHU long-stay patients meeting monthly meeting at the chief psychiatrist's office quarterly meetings with ACAT presidential members Mental Health Consumer Network quarterly meetings monthly individual care plan meetings at Dhulwa AMHU weekly consumer meetings. A number of issues were identified in 2018-19 that necessitated regular monitoring. Many of these issues were raised and addressed as service and system improvement matters. It is worth noting that most of these issues have been ongoing for many years. A longstanding issue for the ACT is that, being a small jurisdiction, there is a limited range of specialised units or teams addressing complex situations. For some people, specialised interstate facilities may provide appropriate treatment options though this can prove challenging. Access can be limited as they do not accept many interstate referrals. Alternatively, the travel required or being away from home for the specified time is not feasible for the consumer. The issue of highly specialised treatment particularly for young people with complex high-level needs is an issue that has been raised by the PACYPC as warranting further consideration in this jurisdiction. This will continue to be a focus for the PACYPC. Another issue identified in 2018-19 related to what appears to be the ongoing use of temporary staff, significant changes of clinicians, and inconsistency in treating teams within the inpatient facilities at the Canberra Hospital. Many consumers advised the PACYPC they had been being negatively impacted by changes within their clinical teams, with both consumers and family members raising concerns about the impact this has on treatment outcomes. CASE STUDYSupport needs for a young person The Official Visitor for disability referred a matter to the PACYPC where there was difficulty getting information from the parent of a young person. Given the complexity of the young person's support needs, the absence of information regarding the young person's condition and treatment recommendations presented a level of risk to both the young person and the service should an emergency situation arise, given that staff would be unlikely to know how best to respond. It was unclear why the parent seemed reluctant to provide information to the support staff. The PACYPC intervened by making some enquiries with the service concerned and sought consent from the parent to visit the young person. Once consent was provided, the PACYPC arranged a service visit, which included a discussion with staff supporting the young person to clarify the support needs and general diagnosis. The young person had no language to express his own views and did not sign, however the PACYPC observed the young person and the staff interaction with him, and formed the view that the young person was at ease with his support workers. The PACYPC also formed the view that staff the young person had the experience and skills to manage the relationship. The parent of the young person also engaged in discussion with the PACYPC and agreement was reached about providing a copy of the NDIS plan to the service to assist them in responding appropriately to the young person. Responding to matters such as these raises the profile of the role and the functions of the PACYPC among service users and service providers in disability and other sectors, and helps establish improved communication and referral pathways with those organisations. It also encourages people residing in or accessing those services to approach the PACYPC directly with concerns. 91 Annual Report 2018-19 Revolving door in mental health inpatient facilities An issue identified through the PACYPC's review of compliance documentation is that of the increasing number of revolving door occurrences in relation to the admission of mental health consumers in inpatient facilities. The PACYPC has received numerous concerns from family members claiming that their loved ones have been discharged before they are well enough, and they are subsequently readmitted in a further deteriorated mental state. The MH Act includes provisions relating to the flow of information to, and involvement of, carers in mental health treatment, care and support. Families reporting that they are not being included in these critical discussions about their loved ones continues to be of concern. The PACYPC is working actively to encourage and facilitate more effective communication between parties and the active involvement of carers in discharge planning. Hoarding and squalor case management group The PACYPC is a member of the hoarding case management group (HCMG), which facilitates an integrated and coordinated interagency approach to the management of complex hoarding and domestic squalor matters in this jurisdiction. The HCMG meets on a bimonthly basis and involves a number of ACT Government directorates and a community agency. On average, this group provides oversight for approximately six matters at any one time with a key agency taking the lead, implementing action plans and facilitating the multidisciplinary response for each matter. This model of practice is highly effective. During this reporting period, the PACYPC had leadership of three matters. In undertaking this role, the PACYPC has convened meetings with property owners, facilitated case conferences, met with legal practitioners, guardians, other advocacy agencies, community services and with family members and has attended tribunal or court hearings. The PACYPC has also attended properties when inspections are scheduled to provide support to the property owner. Due to comorbidity and the complexity of matters, the PACYPC provides this service from existing resourcing despite the intensity required in responding to such matters. To illustrate the intensity of advocacy provision, one case involving complex animal hoarding required the PACYPC to provide 57 episodes of advocacy in this reporting period alone, noting that this matter has been ongoing since the previous reporting period. Intensive, steady progress has been achieved in that matter. Complex hoarding and domestic squalor matters necessitate the development of effective collaboration and partnerships across government and with community agencies, who are often best placed to provide ongoing support services to property owners, particularly as follow-up can be long term. The PACYPC was supportive of, and provided input into, the implementation of the Hoarding Advocacy Support Services (HASS) trial, which was undertaken by Woden Community Services. This has been a positive initiative of the ACT Government and resulted in progress for matters before the HCMG. In addition, this service is often called upon by government agencies for consultation and advice about managing hoarding and squalor matters more generally. The PAYCPC advocates for such a service to be funded on an ongoing basis. CASE STUDYImproved treatment for distressed young man A young man with chronic treatment-resistant schizophrenia, living in supported accommodation, was admitted to AMHU with a deteriorating mental state. He had previously functioned well in the community but after a change of medication, his mental state became unstable. He was admitted to AMHU on three occasions in a short timeframe and each time was discharged fairly quickly back to his supported accommodation. The PACYPC investigated, after being contacted by a family member. PACYPC staff spoke with the young man's family, his case manager and the manager at his supported accommodation. All reported that the young man was currently unstable and distressed, and detailed a range of concerning behaviours. The PACYPC intervened and had him readmitted under a new treating team, and requested that his family be informed of all decisions about his care, treatment and support. The PACYPC also advocated for him to go on to the University of Canberra's Adult Mental Health Rehabilitation Unit (AMHRU) for mental health rehabilitation once his mental state was sufficiently stable. Currently his placement at AMHRU is being considered and the young man is improving.. 92 ACT Human Rights CommissionStrategic Priority 3: Enhance Services and Service Delivery Children and Young People Allegations of abuse in care (section 507 reports) When CYPS undertake an appraisal of an abuse in care allegation for a child or young person in OoHC, CSD's Director-General (DG) must inform the PACYPC. In 2018-19, the PACYPC received 78 notifications under section 507 of the CYP Act. The following should be noted in respect of these figures: One report was a re-referral from the previous reporting period. The PACYPC was requested by CYPS to set aside the original report due to additional information needing to be considered. The report to the PACYPC was subsequently resubmitted by the DG in the current reporting period. Another report was first notified to the PACYPC on 13 July 2018 and then notified again on 20 November 2018 (with additional information). Two other reports were also submitted twice. The actual number of section 507 reports in the current reporting period is 74. Table 23: s507 notifications to the PACYPC (2016-19) 3 months 18 0 13 0 35 1 3-6 months 35 3 40 3 39 10 7-9 months 10 1 6 0 0 0 10-12 months 0 0 9 0 0 0 13-24 months 0 0 5 0 0 0 > 2 years 0 0 1 1 0 0 Total 63 4 (6.35%) 74 4 (5.41%) 74 11 (14.86%)Of these, almost 15 per cent were substantiated in 2018-19, in contrast to 5 per cent in the previous reporting period. The substantiations involved children and young people in the following placements: two in residential care, three in foster care and six in kinship care. Eight of the substantiations were in relation to physical abuse while three were for neglect. The children and young people impacted were aged between three to 15 years. Further analysis of the section 507 information received by the PACYPC in 2018-19 indicates that: 61 per cent were in relation to children/young people in kinship placement, 26 per cent were in foster care and 12 per cent were in residential care. 93 Annual Report 2018-19 Table 24: placement type, section 507 concern 2017-18 and 2018-19 Care arrangements 2017-18 2018-19 Kinship 5% 1.35% While the number of allegations in residential care represents only 12 per cent of the total section 507 reports received by the PACYPC, it should be noted that this is significant given there have been, on average, only 30 children and young people in residential care each month. Even taking into account that 54 individual children and young people have accessed residential care in 2018-19 (with some care-leavers having exited, other new children and young people coming in and some short-stays), these figures remain of concern. The number of abuse in care notifications received in relation to children and young people in kinship placements remains significantly higher than that of the other out-of-home placement types. The information received in section 507 notifications does not allow the PACYPC to identify the factors that may be contributing to the higher notification rate for children and young people in kinship placements. However, information sought under section 879 of the CYP Act in response to concerns raised in care notifications to the PACYPC suggests that the consistency of assessment processes for kinship placements and the adequacy of post placement support may need to be looked into. PACYPC investigations (section 879 requests) Over this reporting period, the PACYPC continued to carry out additional investigations using information compelled from CYPS under section 879 of the CYP Act. The PACYPC made 72 section 879 requests in 2018-19. The primary area of further investigation related to concerns about abuse in care allegations, which constituted 46 per cent of further enquiries made by the PACYPC. In addition to these information requests, the PACYPC's concerns about the welfare of children and young people were sufficiently significant to warrant direct correspondence with the DG, CSD on two occasions and with the Executive Group Manager on one occasion. The PACYPC also wrote to the Chief Executive Officer, Heath Services on one occasion. This is a course of action not taken lightly and was indicative of the level of concern the PACYPC had over the safety and welfare of the young people in question. Table 25: reasons for the PACYPC undertaking further enquiries under section 879 Reason Number Percentage Abuse in care concerns following section 507 notification30 41.67% Bimberi, concerns raised following review of registers11 15.28% Concerns raised by community members in relation to the welfare of child/young person11 15.28% Lack of kinship support 5 6.94% Other 15 20.83% Total 72 100% In 2018-19, requests for further information under section 879 included the following concerns: allegations of children being abused in foster care, including possible sexual abuse lack of comprehensive kinship assessment for children who had been in placements for a significant period of time children being physically abused in OoHC inadequate response by CYPS to allegations of children being abused in care, including delayed interviews of children and failure to notify the AFP in a timely manner allegations about children being abused in residential care and lengthy time-periods for investigations whether children who appeared to have suffered injuries in OoHC received medical treatment young people under the age of 16 couch surfing without anyone exercising parental rights or authority. 94 ACT Human Rights CommissionYoung people at risk - abuse and persistent conflict with parents In 2018-19, community members contacted the PACYPC to raise the issue of young people under 16 years not living with anyone with parental responsibility and in circumstances where they were at risk of exploitation (including sexual exploitation). The PACYPC understands that in many of the individual matters, CYPS did not take action, believing that there was a parent 'willing and able' to provide care and protection. However, information provided to the PACYPC suggests that parents were unable to exert influence over where their children were residing despite some of these arrangements presenting situations of risk for the young people involved. Further, a number of young people advised the PACYPC that they were either fearful of abuse by their parents or had concerns that their parents were unable or unwilling to protect them from abuse, including sexual abuse. These, and other examples, suggest situations of persistent conflict between the young person and their parent/s. The PACYPC has been actively involved in the cases raised and PACYPC staff have met with senior officers from CYPS on a number of occasions to raise concerns about the vulnerability of these young people. Further, the PACYPC advised the DG, CSD of her concerns regarding the vulnerability of this cohort of young people, including that there appears to be an unwillingness by CYPS to take action when young people are viewed to be making their own decisions, even if these decisions leave them vulnerable to abuse and exploitation. The case study provided is one of a number of cases that have been brought to the attention of the PACYPC regarding young people under the age of 16 who are in conflict with their parents, or who believe themselves to be at risk in the care of their parents, and are couch surfing. It is not clear why the provisions in section 345 of the CYP Act are not being used to facilitate appropriate care and protection for this vulnerable group of young people. Further, these situations raise concerns about how many other young people are living outside of the parental home without appropriate supervision to protect them from predatory adults; and/or adequate support to respond to significant risk-taking behaviours.CASE STUDYYoung person at risk A young person was concerned that CYPS intended to return them to their mother's care. The young person contacted the PACYPC and disclosed a history of sexual abuse by persons known to their mother, indicating they felt so unsafe in their mother's care that they had chosen to stay with an adult couple with whom they were familiar. The PACYPC understands that the young person was provided with alcohol, and filmed while under the influence of alcohol, while staying with the couple. Initial action was taken by CYPS following this incident being reported to them. However, when the young person approached the PACYPC, the interim arrangement that had been set up for the young person did not appear to have resolved the situation from the young person's perspective, leaving them with ongoing concerns about their risk of abuse. Two months later, this same young person came to the PACYPC's attention after being admitted to hospital due to mental health concerns. Following discharge, it would appear the young person returned to the couple's home. Despite the risks and concerns identified and raised by the PACYPC, CYPS advised they would be closing the case, having made a determination that the young person had self-placed and that there was a parent 'willing and able' to care for her. The PACYPC is continuing to advocate in respect of this matter. 95 Annual Report 2018-19 Emergency action and court attendance (section 408 reports) The PACYPC continues to prioritise attendance at court for children and young people removed from their family's care under emergency action (EA). Over this reporting period, 91 children and young people were removed under EA, five EAs were revoked and one was not granted at court. The PACYPC attended court on 85 occasions in this reporting period: 47 times in relation to EAs, 20 in following up children's court matters, and 18 in relation to youth justice. Table 26: presenting concern associated with EA 2018-2019 Reasons for EA Number Physical abuse 33 Neglect 27 Mental health 24 Substance abuse 22 Family violence 7 Cumulative harm 5 Child/Family Conflict 5 Emotional abuse 3 Medical neglect 2 Sexual abuse 1 Parental with intellectual disability 1 EA revoked at court 5 Other 7Annual review reports The CYP Act requires the DG to prepare an annual review report (ARR) for a reviewable care and protection order at least once every 12 months while the order is in force, or if the order is in force for less than 12 months, when the order expires. Under s497 of the CYP Act, the DG must provide a copy of every ARR to the PACYPC. An ARR is an account of that child or young person's life over the preceding year and it forms an integral part of the child or young person's life story throughout their care journey. An ARR is therefore intended to provide an accurate and contemporary account of their life under the care of the DG. 96 ACT Human Rights Commission Demographics Of the 70 ARRs reviewed, 67 per cent of the reports were case managed and written by ACT Together, and 33 per cent were case managed and written by CYPS. 29 per cent of ARRs were for Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander children and young people and 17 per cent were from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds. 26 per cent of the ARRs related to children and young people in foster care arrangements; 66 per cent were in kinship care; 1 per cent were in residential care; 6 per cent were with a parent, in an informal care arrangement or had self-placed; and 1 per cent were in shared care arrangements. Findings The review process looked at a number of different dimensions relevant to the child-centric focus that underpins the quality framework. Some of the notable findings are as follows: 26 per cent (18 reports) contained comments that were assessed as potentially being inappropriate, disrespectful or inconsiderate if read by the child/young person when they reach adulthood 34 per cent (24 reports) demonstrated a need for improved language (e.g. needing to be non-judgmental, more child-focused, more strengths-based, etc.) 26 per cent (18 reports) suggested there had been no or little participation by the child or young person who was the subject of the report 86 per cent (60 reports) did not evidence the use of Viewpoint, a survey instrument designed to elicit the views of children and young people in care, to inform the ARR process. The majority (75 per cent) of case workers stated in the ARRs they actively sought the views of the child or young people by way of observations, home visits and consultations. However, 26 per cent did not with some of the reasons being that the child was too young or that the young person was disengaged from their caseworker. The involvement of the child/young person will be an ongoing focus point for the PACYPC in their review of ARRs. Annual Review Reports quality framework project In early 2018-19, CYPS and ACT Together agreed a process to bring all ARRs up to date by 30 June 2019. With this in mind, the PACYPC agreed to focus its compliance monitoring in 2018-19 on the quality of ARRs, emphasising the purpose of ARRs. ARRs are written to enable historical record-keeping for children and young people; and to support a child/young person's sense of identity. ARRs must be viewed as a document owned and written for the child or young person; and as a document that is accessible at any time, including into their adulthood. The focus on quality is to ensure an accurate and positive reframing of a child or young person's experience of care. Project methodology In 2018-19, the PAYPC developed a quality assurance framework to assess the quality of the ARR, and the process by which the document is written and reviewed. The three underlying principles of the framework are rights-based record keeping, child-safe principles and trauma informed practice. From the rights-based record-keeping perspective, there was a particular focus on seeking to determine the extent to which children and young people were involved in the ARR process, and on whether the language used in the ARRs was in keeping with a dignity-driven and strengths-based approach to the way information about the child or young person was presented. In 2018-19, the PACYPC trialled this framework using systemised random sampling to review 70 ARRs received between 1 July 2018 and January 2019. 97 Annual Report 2018-19 There were a number of categories that did not contain much detail or did not mention particular information. For example, none of the ARRs discussed seeking a young person's consent to forward the report onto significant others or providing the child or young person with the opportunity to review the ARR prior to being finalised. These activities may be occurring however it is not being articulated. If it is not occurring, then these are functions that need to be incorporated into the process in support of children's rights. There appears to be a need for more work on positive reframing and a reconsideration of what information should be incorporated into ARRs. For example, some of the issues that were identified included the use of professionalised language especially in respect of court orders and contact arrangements, the detailed information on DNA results and paternity tests, or the reasons being provided for a parent's inability to care for their child. The PACYPC will continue to use the ARR quality framework to monitor ARR compliance with an emphasis on the importance of using child-safe, child-friendly practices and review processes to ensure direct consultation with children and young people and their participation in matters relating to their time in care. The level of quality will be assessed with consideration for whether the child or young person was provided with opportunities, and supported, to provide input, review content and consider and decide what information and images should be shared/included, and how information about their lives will be presented. Annual review report timeframes The PACYPC reviewed 846 ARRs for legislative compliance in 2018-19. Compared to the last reporting period, there has been an improvement in the timeframes for reports received in under three months with a comparative increase of over 10 per cent. To catch up on the backlog of ARR reports, some reports received in 2018-19 covered a two-year period of a child's/young person's life. Although not in keeping with legislative compliance, this has enabled ACT Together to bring the reports for a number of children and young people up to date. It is hoped that, together with application of the ARR quality framework, this will bring improved meaning to ARRs for these children and young people into the future. Table 27: timeframes for receipt of ARRs in 2018-2019 Timeframe Bimberi Justice Centre In 2018-19, activity in relation to Bimberi accounted for 11 (17 per cent) of the PACYPC's further enquiries under section 879 of the CYP Act, as follows: Five related to the use of force. Four were in relation to the timeout register. One was in relation to what was considered to be an inadequate level of observation for a young person prior to a significant attempt at self-harm by strangulation. The final enquiry was to seek clarification on the circumstances that led to a young person being administered at five times the prescribed dosage of medication. The PACYPC undertook an extensive enquiry into this matter with both CSD and Forensic Health. A full account was included in the Commission's 2019 Bimberi report. 98 ACT Human Rights CommissionStrip searches There were no reported strip searches in the 2018-19 reporting period. This is in stark contrast to the 2016-17 period when there were 78 occasions of strip searches, and 51 instances in the 2017-18 period. Prior to 2018-19, children and young people in Bimberi were being routinely strip-searched during standard operations, despite no contraband having been found through these strip searches. It is therefore pleasing to note the practice shift that has occurred in 2018-19. Segregation In the 2018-19 reporting period, the PACYPC received two notifications of segregation in relation to two detainees and relating to the same incident. Segregation on these occasions was for a period of five days for both young people. This is a welcome shift from the previous reporting period in which there were 10 occasions of segregation. Use of lockdown In this reporting period, there were 22 records of the use of operational lockdown - i.e. when young people are locked in their cabins. This is in stark contrast to the 144 occasions reported in 2017-18. There were no reported lockdowns in the first five months of the reporting period. Although there was one reported occasion of lockdown in November 2018 and another two in January 2019, the remaining 19 occasions of lockdown occurred between March-June 2019. The PACYPC understood the staffing challenges that led to the 2017-18 levels of lockdown. The significant reduction in its use in this reporting period is a much welcome change.Timeout Unlike the use of segregation, timeout is not regulated by legislation under the CYP Act. The 2019 Bimberi review was satisfied that there was \"appropriate regulation around, record keeping and oversight occurring in relation to timeout\"; and noted a downward trend in the use of timeout from 2014 to 2017. However, log book data for the 2018-19 period raises concerns about the use of timeout. In this reporting period there were 396 uses of timeout. This exceeds the combined total for the three prior years (2015-17) and places this reporting year's figures on a par with the 2014 figures of 428. In response to the PACYPC's concerns about the length of time some young people were spending in timeout, further investigation into the use of timeout was undertaken in the 2018-19 reporting period, using section 879 of the CYP Act to obtain information. The following table highlights the longest period a young person spent in timeout in each month and in each unit within Bimberi. On one occasion, the timeout response was for over two hours. This raises the question of when timeout becomes segregation. The PACYPC will explore this issue further in 2019-20. 99 Annual Report 2018-19 Figure 7: Bimberi timeout register 020406080100120140160 Longest period in timeout (mins) NamadgiLongest period in In 2018-19, there were 131 instances of the use of force at Bimberi. The review of the registers indicated a spike in the use of force in October and November 2018 with the majority of instances relating to altercations between young people, and/or altercations between young people and staff. There was also a high number of instances where the use of force related to young people refusing to be secured in their rooms. Viewing of CCTV footage The PACYPC has reviewed CCTV footage on a number of incidents involving the use of force and has also made additional information requests under section 879 of the CYP Act in relation to some of these incidents. Unfortunately, the CCTV coverage at Bimberi has a number of blind spots and is limited in its coverage, which means that some incidents are unable to be adequately assessed. It is hoped that the upgrade in the surveillance system will address some of the gaps in the current CCTV coverage and allow for a clearer understanding of staff interaction with young people in Bimberi, specifically when force is being used on the young detainees. 100 ACT Human Rights CommissionIt is hoped that the upgrade in the surveillance system will In this reporting period, the PACYPC also became aware that protective clothing and shields were being utilised during some occasions associated with the use of force. Having reviewed some of the relevant CCTV footage, the PACYPC is concerned about how the use of these items fits in with a trauma-informed approach, particularly if used with younger detainees. The use of such clothing and shields is also contrary to recommendations from the NT's Royal Commission into the Detention and Protection of Children. The PACYPC will be making further enquiries about the considerations that are applied prior to their use and how trauma-informed practices are used after these incidents to support young people subjected to this form of intervention.Critical incidents In 2018-19, the PACYPC raised concerns about the inability to have timely access to critical incident reports to enable review, writing to CSD on 8 April 2019. On 8 April 2019, seventeen critical incident reports were unavailable to the PACYPC. One related to an incident that had occurred three months previously; six incidents had occurred 4-5 weeks previously; and one had occurred in the week prior. At the close of the reporting period, four reports from May 2019 and six from June 2019 had not been made available. This raises significant concerns given that it limits the ability of the PACYPC to provide robust oversight of this critical area of activity in Bimberi. It also limits the ability of PACYPC staff to provide timely advocacy and support for the young people involved should the incidents involve issues of human rights. For example, there was a significant incident on 9 March 2019, which involved a number of staff being stood down. However the PACYPC was not made aware of this incident until 1 April 2019, three weeks after the incident. Having reviewed the CCTV footage of the incident, the PACYPC was concerned about an incident that looked like it could have been significantly traumatising for the young person involved. Unfortunately, the delay in the PACYPC being notified compromised the PACYPC's ability to provide support and advocacy to the young person impacted by the incident who had exited Bimberi by the time the PACYPC was informed of the incident. Another area of significant concern highlighted by the PACYPC over this reporting period was the management and dispensing of medication. In October 2018, the PACYPC raised concerns about the administration of medication to a young man who received five times the prescribed dose. The incident involved a youth worker retrieving medication from the disposal bin to give to the young person. Due to serious concerns about what could potentially be significant health implications for this young person, and to determine if this was an isolated incident, the PACYPC wrote to both the Health Directorate and CSD to obtain further information about this incident and to enquire into how often medication was improperly administered or not administered to young detainees. The Health Directorate advised the PACYPC of 15 such occasions but CSD only had a record of one occasion. This raised further concerns about reporting disparity, though the PACYPC was informed that it was due to different recording processes. However as both agencies are responsible, at different times, for administering medication, it was concerning that they did not appear to CASE STUDY CCTV footage involving the use of force in Bimberi The PACYPC viewed an incident in which a young person was brought to the ground by Bimberi staff, and suffered an injury to their leg and elbow. While the response provided by the CYPS senior manager states that the use of force was warranted on this occasion, they acknowledge that the \"technique used during the use of force was not consistent with training practices\". The director of Bimberi notes in their record from reviewing the CCTV footage that \"the footage is unclear relating to what techniques were used\". On reviewing the footage, the PACYPC also raised concerns about what appeared to be a young person being swung by staff as a means to bring them to the ground. However the CCTV coverage limitations meant the PACYPC was unable to fully assess the circumstances as there was no way to obtain a completely unobstructed view of what occurred. 101 Annual Report 2018-19 have an agreed standard of reporting in this critical area. In addition to the incident that prompted the inquiry, the information provided to the PACYPC highlighted administrative errors including failure to provide medication as prescribed (e.g. providing a subsequent dosage before the required time interval had been reached) and failure to provide medication to a young person with psychosis and suicidal ideation for two days. Subsequent to the above incident involving the maladministration of medication in October 2018, it was of concern that other issues in relation to medication were identified in November 2018 and January 2019. On these two occasions, young people have been able to access medication intended for other young people in Bimberi. On one occasion, a young person was able to take another young person's medication from them and, on the other, take another young person's medication from the nurse's trolley without being noticed. On both occasions, the young detainees were able to consume this medication, which could have resulted in significant health consequences and required them to be closely monitored and woken up on a regular basis to ensure there were no ill effects. It is not clear from the information provided why these potentially life-threatening occurrences did not merit being categorised as category one incidents. Further, these incidents emphasised the PACYPC's concerns about the lack of supervision of young people during medication rounds, the lack of confidentiality associated with medication administration, and the associated safety issues for children and young people. The PACYPC is pleased to note that the inquiry into these matters has prompted a review of medication administration practices and that changes have been implemented. This issue will be closely monitored in 2019-20.Individual advocacy at Bimberi In this reporting period a number of young detainees requested meetings with the PACYPC to raise concerns regarding their treatment in Bimberi. The issues raised by young people included: being discriminated against due to gender identity; gender discrimination due to lack of programs for female detainees; not being respected by staff or being picked on by staff; and difficulties accessing health services. The Bimberi director agreed to meet with the PACYPC and the young detainees to discuss their concerns and the matters were mostly resolved to the satisfaction of the young people. The limited range of gender-specific programs for female detainees remained unresolved. In 2018, the PACYPC and the Official Visitor worked in collaboration to support and advocate for a young person who was being considered for transfer to the AMC. Following this intervention, it was agreed not to transfer the young person. However, the young person felt they were being treated to a different standard to other young people in the centre and raised these concerns with the PACYPC and the Official Visitor. The PACYPC worked closely with colleagues in other parts of the Commission on this issue. The young person has subsequently raised a human rights legal action in the Supreme Court. Transition from out of home care The PACYPC continues to be closely involved in monitoring transition from care plans for young people who are preparing to exiting care. To this end, the PACYPC participates in a multi-agency panel involving ACT Together, CSD and CREATE Foundation to review plans for this cohort of young people. Of concern, however, is that anecdotal information suggests that some young people are becoming homeless shortly after their transition from care, or find themselves couch surfing. A particular challenge for the PACYPC is that there is no statutory means by which we can receive or request information in this area without the young person's permission, and as these young people may be struggling with addiction or mental health difficulties they may not be aware that the PACYPC will continue to advocate for them should they wish us to do so. The PACYPC has recently created an information-sharing consent form to facilitate continued advocacy on behalf of young people exiting care and, in the next reporting period, will work in partnership with the CREATE Foundation to advocate for improvements in the adequacy of supports for young people after they have exited care. 102 ACT Human Rights Commission PACYPC Jodie Griffiths-Cook at the Create Foundation's Little Legends awards in October 2018. Operational oversight meetings with services for the protection of children and young people During this reporting period, the PACYPC continued to convene monthly meetings with CYPS, ACT Together, Uniting, Premier Youth Workers and the Official Visitors. These meetings have facilitated open discussion on concerns and enabled joint work in resolving matters. The PACYPC acknowledges, and appreciates, the commitment of agencies to working together in the interests of upholding the rights of children and young people, and responding to concerns regarding their physical and emotional wellbeing. Interview friends program The interview friends program has existed in the ACT for over 20 years and provides volunteer support to young people during police interviews, when no other parent, guardian, or other adult support person is able to undertake this function. Anglicare have operational responsibility for the interview friends program for young people in the ACT, with the PACYPC providing oversight and support to the service and assisting with ongoing recruitment and training of new interview friends. During this reporting period, the PACYPC met with Anglicare to review the program guidelines. This review also included Legal Aid ACT who provided feedback on areas of the guidelines that required review. A training course for interview friends will occur early in the next reporting period. ACT Policing have been approached to assist in the delivery of this training. 103 Annual Report 2018-19 Mental health and forensic mental health Under the MH Act, a key role for the PACYPC is consumer- focused monitoring and statutory oversight. This year the PACYPC has identified a number of systemic trends through the performance of individual advocacy functions, reviewing mental health documentation and processes, and responding to consumer identified issues. Issues emerging within mental health advocacy in 2018-19 included the need for more effective communication with family members and carers of people receiving mental health services; limitations in the effectiveness of responses for people with borderline personality disorder; challenges in accessing legal assistance and support for complex legal matters; parents with complex needs who are involved with child protection; young people with complex needs engaging with multiple service systems; access to NDIS supports for people with psychosocial disability; and a shortage of mental health professionals in the ACT. The issues experienced by people with psychosocial disability in accessing the NDIS has been a critical and continuing focus for the PACYPC this year. In addition to advocacy provided in response to ongoing access and service provision issues, multiple concerns were raised with the PACYPC about the inadequate skill level of staff employed to support consumers with complex needs in supported accommodation. This lack of expertise to manage complex mental health needs and behavioural issues can lead to the consumer either losing their accommodation or admission to a facility. There have been occasions where supported accommodation agencies have refused to work with complex consumers, and the only alternative has been long term admissions to mental health facilities. This lack of expertise impacts our most vulnerable consumers in the extreme, and requires attention.Notifications under mental health legislation The PACYPC receives notifications from mental health services, health care professionals, and ACAT under the MH Act. The PACYPC reviews and monitors this paperwork in relation to involuntary care, treatment and support. In the 2018-19 reporting year, there were 5705 notifications received for 1087 people, reflecting an increase of almost 5 per cent from the previous year. The number of notifications received has risen steadily over the past three years since the introduction of the MH Act. Notably, the average number of notifications per person has also increased. Table 28: number of notifications received by person 2016-18 Reporting periodNumber of notificationsNumber of people notifications received are reviewed with follow-up actions undertaken as required. Actions required from the review of the paper work include following up with consumers who are in hospital; following up with treating teams to request more information or to raise concerns from the notifications; and attending tribunal hearings. The PACYPC also attended meetings and made referrals to external agencies such as ACT Disability Aged Carer Advocacy Service (ADACAS) and Legal Aid. Notifications are reviewed for compliance with legislation and human rights, to identify individuals needing advocacy, and to analyse and identify emerging systemic trends. In 2018-19, some of the issues that were identified and/or in which the PACYPC intervened involved consumers who had experienced multiple admissions and discharges within short timeframes. (See: p92, Revolving door in mental health inpatient facilities). This was identified through both the PACYPC's review of compliance paperwork and by family members who contacted the PACYPC to express their concerns. 104 ACT Human Rights CommissionThis increase in the average number of notifications per person is matched by an increase in the number of occasions of advocacy per person (See: Table 29: individual mental health advocacy 2016-18) and reflects the increased complexity of matters brought to the attention of, and which require action by, the PACYPC. Individual mental health advocacy During 2018-19, the PACYPC provided 1111 occasions of individual advocacy for 343 children, young people and adults who had contact with mental health and/or forensic mental health services. This included the provision of individual advocacy for 277 adults with mental illness, 29 people involved with forensic mental health services and 37 young people experiencing mental health concerns. The reduction in numbers for young people requiring PA advocacy is likely to be due in some part to the new child and adolescent mental health service (CAMHS) outreach service. Table 29: individual mental health advocacy 2016-18 Reporting periodNumber of occasions of advocacyNumber of people for whom advocacy was providedAverage number of occasions of advocacy per person 2016-17 1331 553 2.41 2017-18 1282 461 2.78 2018-19 1111 343 3.19 The number of individuals for whom individual advocacy has been provided over recent years has gradually reduced for a number of reasons. While the PACYPC's increased focus on systemic advocacy has contributed in part to this reduction, the complexity of individual cases in which the PACYPC has been called to intervene and, by extension, the amount of work involved in such cases has also been a contributing factor. The following case study demonstrates the breadth of activity that is often warranted to achieve an outcome that upholds an individual's human rights and facilitates their ongoing health and wellbeing.CASE STUDYAppealing a psychiatric treatment order A consumer with a diagnosis of schitzotypal personality disorder first came to the PACYPC's attention when he was in AMHU. At the time, he was homeless and it was winter. He had no family, no income, no social network, and was living in a tent on a local mountain. The PACYPC advocated strongly for a community mental health team to become involved and to make immediate applications for both housing and the disability support pension (DSP). The PACYPC also wrote letters of support to ACT Housing. However, prior to securing housing, the community psychiatrist applied to ACAT for a psychiatric treatment order (PTO). Despite the consumer accepting his longstanding mental health diagnosis, being willing to take his prescribed medication, and actively engaging with his community mental health team, ACAT placed him on a six-month PTO. The perceived risk for the consumer was premised on historical information, with ACAT stating that the consumer was at risk of non-compliance based on his itinerant lifestyle, and also due to an alleged incident from ten years previous when he was living in a caravan park in another jurisdiction. The consumer had no criminal record. The consumer was devastated by the PTO and the PACYPC supported him to appeal this decision, arguing that the criteria for a PTO had not been met, and also informing ACAT that the consumer wanted to live in the ACT, wanted treatment, was waiting for the DSP and housing, and was therefore not at risk of absconding. Unfortunately, the decision was upheld. Four weeks after being discharged from AMHU, the consumer had both permanent ACT housing and the DSP. The PACYPC continued to work with the consumer, including by investigating the nature of the matters used by ACAT in their determination, and determining the facts of both these circumstances and other matters that were referenced in reports that were used as evidence in making the determination. 105 Annual Report 2018-19 Individual advocacy for people with high and complex needs As noted above, in 2018-19, individual advocacy by the PACYPC has targeted complex and high-needs consumers, where intervention by the PACYPC can produce an outcome that may not be achievable without the exercise of its statutory powers. Individual advocacy was also provided to assist people to understand involuntary mental health treatment provisions, and to support people to get legal representation and better understand complex legal matters. CASE STUDYBack to work and in stable housing A young man with bipolar disorder was referred to the PACYPC by a family member. The young man was couch surfing after losing his tenancy due to non-payment of his rent. He was in a manic phase of his illness and he was gambling and drinking. He had full-time employment but was taking a lot of time off and was at risk of losing his job. The PACYPC contacted his local community mental health team and asked that they re-open this matter and appoint him a case manager (CM). Once a CM was appointed the PACYPC requested they urgently apply for ACT Housing, indicating the PACYPC would provide a letter of support. The young man was in financial difficulties with multiple credit card and other debts. The PACYPC spoke with the young man and his family members about financial management for a short period, with the aim of seeking to have his credit card debts waived, and a payment plan for other debts set up. Concerns were raised about the banks allowing the young man, who was already heavily in debt and homeless, to be allowed increasingly more credit. Financial management was granted and the substantial credit card debt was investigated and subsequently waived. After only one month, the young man had an ACT Housing unit, and after six months the financial management order was revoked. The young man went back to work on a graduated return to work program, and the community mental health team were considering closing him to their service. At this point, the PACYPC again intervened and received assurance that the current CM would remain involved to monitor the situation. So far this young man continues to do well, is back at work part time, and is mentally stable and debt-free.CASE STUDYWhen the PTO came up for review, the PACYPC advocated strongly for the consumer to be granted voluntary status. The PACYPC presented information to ACAT in support of this including that the consumer had now secured housing, was on the DSP, was engaged in full time study, was engaging well with his community mental health team and was fully compliant with his care, treatment and support. The PACYPC also presented evidence to support the establishment of facts for things previously noted in the consumer's PTO report as being \"delusions of grandeur\". Further, the PACYPC presented evidence that disputed the finding of risk in relation to the historical matters previously considered by ACAT. In response, ACAT agreed there was no basis for the continuation of the PTO. The consumer is now flourishing and looking forward to finishing his current studies and working in the sector to help others. 106 ACT Human Rights CommissionACAT mental health hearings In 2018-19, the PACYPC continued to review all applications for mental health orders to determine those matters that would benefit from having the PACYPC attend a hearing to improve support for the person, ensure their voice was heard, and promote greater realisation of human rights and consumer rights under the MH Act. The PACYPC attended 230 hearings for 180 individuals. This continued high rate of attendance supports the PACYPC's aim of ensuring the legislative principles for mental health consumer rights are upheld. PACYPC participation results in consumers and their families having greater awareness of and participation in the process, as well as providing external scrutiny from outside of the mental health system. The need for further individual advocacy is also identified through these processes. Visits to mental health facilities In performing its oversight functions, the PACYPC continued its regular visits to ACT public mental health facilities. This included regular visits to the ACT's secure mental health facility Dhulwa and Dhulwa ECU, AMHU, Calvary Public Hospital's 2N, the AMC, the new University of Canberra AMHRU and the older persons mental health inpatient unit (OPMHIU). The PACYPC met with 187 individuals on 345 occasions during these visits. These visits enable some of the most vulnerable consumers to access PACYPC support and for the PACYPC to contribute to the ongoing development of mental health services through both individual advocacy and feedback to facilities. Table 30: visits to people in mental health facilities 2016-19 Reporting periodNumber of peopleNumber of Visits 2016-17 160 244 2017-18 174 367 2018-19 187 345 During these visits, the PACYPC meets with consumers to provide information, discuss concerns and address issues. In addition to visits with individuals, the PACYPC also attends these facilities to support consumers in case discussions, recovery-focused care planning meetings, and in discharge planning meetings. In reviewing activities at the various inpatient units and in seeking to understand the factors that contribute to changes in patient management, the PACYPC will often identify situations requiring additional advocacy support for consumers. The following case study demonstrates the key role played by the PACYPC in advocating for improved services and facilitating more effective outcomes. 107 Annual Report 2018-19 Disability and complex needs Advocacy provision The PACYPC provided advocacy for 55 individuals with complex disability support needs on 221 occasions in 2018-19. Advocacy targeted concerns including a lack of suitable accommodation, poor or inadequate support, inconsistent supports, and difficulties interacting with and negotiating systems such as the NDIS and aged care. Table 31: individual disability advocacy 2016-19 Reporting periodNumber of occasions of advocacyNumber of people for whom advocacy was providedAverage number of occasions of advocacy per person 2016-17 328 79 4.15 2017-18 279 64 4.36 2018-19 221 55 4.02 A high proportion of individuals referred for advocacy assistance were either NDIS participants or individuals engaged with aged care assessment teams. Where needed, advocacy support was provided to tackle concerns identified by the individuals, their family or by their support services. In 2018-19, the nature of some matters in which the PACYPC intervened were particularly difficult to resolve while others could not be resolved satisfactorily. For example, a number of matters were referred to the PACYPC due to significant risk factors for the person and the NDIS funding approach not covering risk. Despite the PACYPC providing a significant amount of advocacy in such matters and the clients having particularly high and complex needs, sometimes clients do not receive the level of funding support they need to live safely in the community. This is an issue of ongoing concern for the PACYPC. CASE STUDYFacilitating improved outcomes A consumer was brought to the AMHU from the Magistrates Court for a mental health assessment under S309 of Crimes Act 1900. He had been charged with assault. The consumer has chronic schizo-affective disorder, OCD, intellectual disability, and associated behavioural issues. He was usually stable on his medication, however there had been an abrupt change to the medication prescribed by his doctor and this was thought to be the trigger for the sudden onset of unmanageable aggressive behaviours. The consumer is a large and strong man, which makes management of aggressive episodes challenging for staff, and had resulted in many episodes of seclusion during his year-long stay in the AMHU. Many stakeholder and professional meetings were held over this time and various management options had been explored. Multiple accommodation options in the community had also been trialled. Unfortunately, most attempts only lasted a day or two before the consumer was brought back to the AMHU. Following the PACYPC's initial inquiries into patient management of the consumer, the PACYPC attended many meetings to discuss options for the consumer and was kept informed of the ongoing challenges. One of the things the PACYPC advocated strongly for was for the consumer to be admitted to Dhulwa where the staff/patient ratio is much higher, the environment is much calmer, and the staff and consumers are not constantly changing. Following continued advocacy, the PACYPC was pleased to see this occur and the consumer is now more settled, his medication is more effective and the episodes of seclusion are significantly less. It is anticipated that the consumer will be transitioned into supported accommodation with intensive supports in the not too distant future. 108 ACT Human Rights CommissionVisits to facilities providing services to adults and older persons with complex needs/disability To facilitate the provision of timely and responsive advocacy, the PACYPC visited the University of Canberra rehabilitation unit and the older persons mental health service monthly and on request throughout 2018-19. Both areas are provided with a schedule of planned visits for the year ahead and nursing staff are encouraged to remind consumers of impending visits. As part of the PACYPC's work in these facilities, the PACYPC may assist consumers at the point of discharge by making referrals to community advocacy services. The PACYPC will also attend mental health hearings in relation to Community Care Orders (CCOs) and ECT applications for individuals who are consumers of the above services. In 2018-19, the PACYPC intervened when it was identified that ACAT hearings held at these locations were not fully meeting the needs of the consumers due to issues with the video link, with one hearing having been held on the ward using only a normal telephone. The consumers concerned may be challenged with sensory impairments, as was the case where the husband of the consumer had a hearing impairment. ACAT have agreed that whenever possible they will hold the hearing in person. Management Assessment Panel coordination During 2018-19, MAP received fewer referrals than in 2017-18. Four clients were referred, including one who did not meet the MAP criteria. Eight conferences were convened for three MAP clients, and 38 occasions of advocacy were provided in this reporting period. Although the number of MAP clients was lower in 2018-19 than 2017-18, the matters heard demonstrated a high level of complexity with an average of 2.66 conferences required per client. Further, while there were fewer MAP conferences held than in the previous year, the PACYPC participated in case discussions and conferences with several individuals and agencies where the auspices of the MAP were not required. (See also p89 Management Assessment Panel.) CASE STUDYAdvocacy undertaken following a referral to MAP Through MAP intervention, an individual who was deemed to be at significant risk in the community was able to be supported to remain living in her own home. She was initially resistant to all recommendations from her treating physician and care team in relation to the management of her kidney failure. The coordination role of the MAP and the requirement for participants to feed back on the actions allocated to them resulted in actions being followed up within the timescales set. Knowing the requirement to take action and report back to the MAP placed a responsibility on participants to follow up in a timely manner. It also meant the care team had regular access to the renal consultant who was able to provide plain English guidance about the dialysis this person required. Through this process, the individual felt better supported due to having a patient and consistent care team. As a result, the recommendations for dialysis have been accepted. The individual has continued to attend dialysis and her renal specialist is now advising that a kidney transplant may be possible. MAP's success in facilitating a cohesive and cooperative support team has contributed to improving this individual's quality of life and potentially prolonging her life expectancy. 109 Annual Report 2018-19 ACT Care Coordinator The ACT Care Coordinator is responsible for coordinating the provision of treatment, care or support for a person with a mental disorder for whom a CCO applies and for a person for whom a forensic community care order (FCCO) is in force. CCOs and FCCOs are made by ACAT. Executive officer functions for the ACT Care Coordinator are undertaken by a PACYPC staff member. CCOs/FCCOs are made for people for whom guardianship is not sufficient and who have disturbances of behaviour associated with other disorders of the mind, such as: dementia intellectual disability acquired brain injury personality disorders degenerative neurological disorders. The majority of clients with CCOs have their care needs met by either mainstream services or the NDIS. Over time, care and support has changed in response to the introduction of NDIS and the changing role of Disability ACT. In the reporting period, ten people were subject to a CCO: four men and six women. Nine people were also subject to restriction orders during the reporting period. There were eight people for whom new CCOs were made. No FCCOs were made during this reporting period. Of the ten people subject to a CCO, two people had dementia and eight had complex and challenging behaviours. During this reporting period there has been a notable increase in individuals diagnosed with eating disorders for whom a CCO has been made. Of the ten individuals subject to CCOs in this reporting period, four individuals were placed on orders due to eating disorders. At various points in their treatment, all four individuals also required a restriction order in addition to the CCO to maintain them at a place of treatment and care. In the absence of a restriction order, it is likely they would have discharged themselves from the treatment facility and not received the necessary treatment to support recovery. Due to the complexity of eating disorders and non-compliance with treatment and recovery plans being common, interventions for these individuals are more frequent and complex than for some of the other disorders managed under CCOs. The level of activity required by the executive officer in respect of these matters reflects this.On 11 June 2019, the Commission advised ACT Health that, due to resourcing constraints, the PACYPC would not be able to continue providing executive officer functions for the ACT Care Coordinator. Following a transition period, executive officer functions will fully transfer to ACT Health as at 30 September 2019. Although the PACYPC will no longer hold the executive officer functions, there is still a legislative requirement for the PACYPC to be notified of CCOs. In 2019-20, the PACYPC will monitor the number of CCOs for which the presenting issue relates to eating disorders, and provide advocacy in these matters as required. Family and personal violence matters The Family Violence Act 2016 (FV Act) and Personal Violence Act 2016 (PV Act) allows young people and people with impaired decision-making to access support from the PACYPC in court proceedings. Under the legislation, the court may notify the PACYPC about such a matter. In 2018-19, the PACYPC was notified about 46 matters relating to 38 individuals. Of these, 5 were children or young people and 33 were adults identified as having either a mental illness, disability or mental health vulnerability. The PACYPC provided 69 episodes of advocacy in this reporting period. The provision of advocacy is increasing and the PACYPC will monitor this trend in the next reporting period. The PACYPC continued to build on processes established in the last reporting period to streamline referrals. There was a small decrease in the number of individuals referred to the PACYPC compared with previous years. A reason for this could be due to the court having discretion to notify the PAYCPC. While the number of individuals referred decreased, a higher percentage (55 per cent) of referrals received by the PACYPC required support and advocacy. 110 ACT Human Rights CommissionThe PACYPC reviewed documents sent by the court and identified if there was anyone involved in the person's life who could represent or assist them, such as a parent, litigation guardian or guardian. For children and young people, parents usually fulfil this role. The PACYPC contacted parents and, where needed, provided information and support to them. Provisions in the interim orders for young people allowed the PACYPC to contact those involved in the young person's care and discuss the matter, such as schools and mental health case workers. This allows the PACYPC to ensure there is full support for the young person. Of the five young people referred to the PACYPC, only three young people were provided direct advocacy by the PACYPC. However for one of these matters, this required intensive advocacy, with 21 episodes of advocacy provided. Of the referrals received by the PACYPC involving young people, two were family violence matters where the applicant is a parent and the respondent a child under the age of 18. This is an increase from previous years and is an area that the PACYPC will be monitoring closely in the future. Without further interrogation, it is difficult to determine if this is an actual increase in numbers or just an increase in referrals given that referrals to the PACYPC are at the court's discretion. Discussions with families involved in family violence matters with a young person suggest that there are limited services in the ACT to assist families to address issues before it turns into a police or court matter. This is particularly difficult for families who have little to no support in the ACT and are told to apply for family violence orders by the police, when they have called requesting assistance. For adults, the PACYPC reviewed documentation, where possible made contact with the person prior to the court date, and considered whether individual advocacy would be of assistance to the person to progress the matter. The PACYPC also assessed whether an application for guardianship or for a litigation guardian would be appropriate. In making these enquiries, the PACYPC sought to identify the least restrictive option that would uphold the person's rights. In 2018-19, 57 per cent of adults referred from the court were provided with advocacy assistance, including by the PACYPC attending court conferences.CASE STUDYPersonal protection order for a young person A personal protection order (PPO) involving a young person was referred to the PACYPC for assistance. The PACYPC was advised that the young person's parent had informed the court that they did not want to support the young person through the court process. The young person was the respondent, and the applicant was also under the age of 18. The PACYPC attended the matter in court to support the young person who did not have a parent in attendance. Through discussions, it became evident that it was a complex matter and that the applicant was also harassing the respondent. The young person was born in another country and moved to Australia with their family when they were younger, after spending their early years in a refugee camp. The PACYPC advocated for an adjournment for the young person to seek legal representation. The matter was adjourned for ten weeks. During that time the PACYC assisted the young person to obtain legal advice by advocating for legal representation and attending meetings with the lawyer. The PACYPC continued to support the young person in hearings and has been able to explain to the young person and their family their rights, particularly in relation to any discrimination and racism they may experience. The PACYPC also offered assistance to the young person to organise supports and referrals as needed. 111 Annual Report 2018-19 In a number of matters, the PACYPC was able to work closely with organisations already involved in the person's care. Mental health case workers and other service providers have attended court to support people in matters at the request of the PACYPC. Of the matters referred to the PACYPC, the key presenting issues were family conflicts (47 per cent overall, and 20 per cent being between a parent and an adult child) and neighbour disputes (20 per cent). 55 per cent of all individuals referred had a mental illness. In supporting improved outcomes for people experiencing vulnerability, the PACYPC attends the family violence inter-agency meeting. This provides an opportunity to work with other agencies in legal and judicial agencies to improve responses to violence experienced by vulnerable groups. 112 ACT Human Rights CommissionB.3 Scrutiny During 2018-2019, the following recommendations were relevant to the Commission: recommendations 4.7 and 4.8 from the ACT Legislative Assembly Standing Committee on Justice and Community Safety\u2014Report on Annual and Financial Reports 2017-2018 recommendations 97 and 98 from the Inquiry into Appropriation Bill 2018-19 and the Appropriation (OLA) Bill 2018-2019, Select Committee on Estimates.

The Committee recommends that a program for public consultation and input into the Victims of Crime Charter of Rights be developed and publicly promoted to ensure the community (especially victims and those affected by crime) are given the best opportunity to have input into drafting the final documentation. Agreed. The VOCC has made direct contact with victims who have received support from victim services in recent years to inform them of the consultation and offer support to individuals who wish to participate in the consultation. Complete. B.4 Risk management The Commission's risk register is a living document and is considered by Commissioners at their monthly meetings. During the reporting period, the Commission undertook a test exercise of its business continuity plan with an external consultant (Tigertail). The consultant found that the leadership responded very well to the scenario and its challenges. 113 Annual Report 2018-19 B.5 Internal audit JACSD's internal audit policies and procedures apply to the Commission. See the JACSD Annual Report 2018-2019. B.6 Fraud Prevention There were no reports or allegations of fraud directed at the Commission in 2018-2019. JACSD's fraud control policies and procedures applied to the Commission. Compliance is detailed in the JACSD Annual Report 2018-2019. B.7 Work health and safety The Commission was not issued with any improvement, prohibition or non-disturbance notices under Part 10 of the Work Safety Act 2011. During the reporting period the Commission operated according to JACSD work health and safety (WHS) policies and procedures. The Commission monitored and improved on WHS by including it as a standing agenda item at monthly Commissioner and staff meetings, reviewing, identifying and resolving potential hazards. B.8 Human resources management ACT Shared Services and JACSD' People and Workplace Strategy Branch assisted the Commission with recruitment in 2018-2019. The Commission independently manages staff retention, support and training. In 2018-2019 the Commission employed 62 staff, the overwhelming majority of them female.

The Commission actively encouraged staff to only print paper copies when necessary, use recycled paper and switch off computers and other electrical devices when not needed. The Commission is unable to report against energy consumption, transport, fuel and water use; or waste and greenhouse emissions generation. 117 Annual Report 2018-19SECTION C: Financial management reporting C.1 Financial management analysis See C.2 C.2 Financial statements In line with the Commission's governance and corporate support protocol with JACSD, its financial reporting is included in the JACSD Annual Report 2018-2019. C.3 Capital works The Commission undertook no activity related to capital works in 2018-2019. C.4 Asset management The JACSD asset management strategies applied to the Commission and are detailed in the JACSD' Annual Report 2018-2019.C.5 Government contracting The Commission entered into one contract with a suppliers of services, goods or works valued at more than $25,000 during the reporting period, procuring the Resolve, complaints and case management software for $540,028 GST inclusive. This is a much-needed upgrade, in order to ensure that the Commission reduces the administrative load of maintaining multiple systems; and allows for greater efficiency by being able to adjust business processes quickly. Procurement selection and management processes for all Commission contracts complied with the ACT Government Procurement Act 2001 , the ACT Government Procurement Regulation 2007 and subordinate guidelines and circulars throughout 2017-2018.

Three questions included in the evaluation form allow clients to provide feedback on whether the Commissions' process was fair, accessible and understandable. ii The Public Advocate surveys stakeholders using the online tool Survey Monkey. This online process has significantly increased the number of responses, while the additional anonymity it provides has allowed respondents to provide clearer feedback about the services provided than was previously available. iii Documentation refers primarily to compliance documents received from mental health services and the Office for Children, Youth and Family Support; and reports provided with individual requests or referrals for advocacy. iv Actioned refers to all initial contacts taken to directly communicate with people who are referred to the services. These include telephone calls, email and written correspondence. Explanation of Material Variances ( +/-10%) 1 The higher than target outcome is mainly due to high level of client satisfaction and more timely service. 2 The higher than target outcome for the percentage of complaints closed can be attributed to increased attention to early resolution and ongoing review and streamlining of administrative process. 3 The higher than target outcome is mainly due to a high level of activity conducted by the Human Rights Commission during the period, engaging with the community at a wide range of functions that enable the Commission to reach its client base effectively. The Commission has amended the full year target from 50 to 70 in 2019-20. 4 The lower than target outcome is mainly due to the complexity of individual matters, which required a greater level of activity for a smaller number of individuals. 120 ACT Human Rights CommissionSECTION N: Community engagement and support Strategic priority 4: increasing community engagement Human Rights Commissioner UNDRIP anniversary The Commission celebrates the UNDRIP anniversary annually, also promoting the HR Act, under which the rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander to maintain, control, protect and develop their culture and cultural ties is provided for by s27(2) of the HR Act. In 2018, UNDRIP was celebrated with a screening of the film After the Apology at the National Museum of Australia. (See p24, Working with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community.) Human rights day forum In 2018, International Human Rights Day (December 10) marked the 70th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR). The Commission hosted a forum at the National Library of Australia, chaired by Commission President Dr Helen Watchirs, with UNIC Director, Chris Woodthorpe. Former High Court judge, The Hon. Michael Kirby AC CMG, gave the keynote address. This was followed by a panel discussion with moderator, journalist Genevieve Jacobs, Frank Brennan SJ AO, CEO of Catholic Social Services Australia, Thomas Albrecht, UNHCR Regional Representative and Claire Mallinson, National Director, Amnesty International Australia. Over 220 people attended and an exit survey by attendees rated the event extremely positively. More than 70 per cent of attendees rated the event as excellent; 55 per cent said that the content was extremely engaging; more than 70 per cent said the speakers were extremely engaging; and 75 per cent said they would be likely to attend future events organised by the Commission. Human Rights Commissioner, Dr Helen Watchirs had an opinion piece published in the Canberra Times on the day. SBS TV and The Canberra Times also covered the event. Speakers at the International Human Rights Day forum in December 2018, (from left) Commission President, Dr Helen Watchirs, Justice Michael Kirby, CEO of Catholic Social Services Australia, Frank Brennan SJ AO, UNHCR Regional Representative, Thomas Albrecht, PACYPC Jodie Griffiths-Cook, UNIC Director, Chris Woodthorpe and (front) National Director, Amnesty International Australia Claire Mallinson. 121 Annual Report 2018-19 Media and community engagement Public awareness about the Commission's work and its advocacy on a number of issues was supported by an active media presence and communications policy. Media and outreach helped drive attendance at the Commission's public events. The Commission and individual Commissioners were quoted or interview in over 50 substantial media pieces, in outlets including ABC radio, TV and online, SBS, Canberra Times, WIN Canberra, Southern Cross Canberra, 2CC Canberra and community radio. They spoke about issues including: an Australian human rights charter the human rights compatibility of ACT legislation advocacy for the victims of crime the introduction of an intermediaries scheme in the ACT racism discrimination the rights of detainees and policies and procedures at both the AMC and Bimberi disability child protection issues, particularly in regard to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community health services.A new website was launched in June 2019. The revised site is easier to navigate, thus assisting clients and stakeholders to find the information they need more quickly. The Commission's Humanity newsletter was revamped with the first edition being published in June 2019. It will be published quarterly. Human rights training The Commission delivered tailored training sessions on the HRA to: ACT Corrections recruits (two sessions) ACT Ombudsman staff Bimberi youth workers. The Commission also delivered sessions to students and other community members, including: ACT Bar Association during their Continuing Professional Development program ACT Law Society as part of Law Week 2018 various presentations to community organisations on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples' cultural rights. In Law Week 2019, a panel from the Commission and Canberra Community Law discussed the impact of human rights legislation locally and nationally. From left, Helen Watchirs, Commission President; Parastou Hatami, program manager, Dhurrawang Aboriginal Human Rights Program; Naomi Gould, senior solicitor, Canberra Community Law; and Heidi Yates, VOCC. 122 ACT Human Rights CommissionDiscrimination, Health Services, Disability and Community Services Commissioner The Discrimination, Health Services, Disability and Community Services Commissioner's team works to ensure the ACT community is aware of the services it can access through the Commission and how the laws we administer can help them resolve issues or barriers they experience to equal participation in the ACT community. We participate in community events, provide training and information sessions to increase community awareness of our services. We engage with key community organisations and other stakeholders to ensure easy referral pathways and build community capacity to address individual and systemic issues using our services. This year, we participated in community information events with: ACT Disability, Aged and Carer Advocacy Service ACT Council of Social Service ACT Health ANU Council of the Ageing Seniors Week information sessions ACT Ombudsman Goodwin Capital Health Network Youth Justice Services ACT Libraries ACT Child & Family Centres Veterinary Practitioners Board Community Services Directorate Mental Health Consumer Council Digital Health Agency Health Care Consumers Association ACT School Sports Migrant and Refugee Settlement Service Multicultural Hub The Law Council. The team also participated in Commission-supported community events such as the 2019 Multicultural Festival, ACT Seniors Week, Mental Health Week, Spring Out and Reconciliation in the Park 2019. Victims of Crime Commissioner The VOCC and the VSACT team take a strategic approach to our engagement with community and front-line services across the ACT. We aim to improve community awareness of our services and to hear from individuals and families about their experiences of the criminal justice system. VSACT also regularly engages with key community organisations to build efficient referral pathways for clients whose lives have been affected by crime. This year, we delivered presentations to agencies including: ACT Disability, Aged and Carer Advocacy Service ACT Council of Social Service Belconnen Community Service Beryl Women's Refuge Canberra Hospital Nurses CatholicCare Child Youth Protection Services Students at Daramalan College DPP DVCS Legal Aid ACT Migrant and Refugee Settlement Service Multicultural Hub Northern Region Network Onelink Quest Solutions Relationships Australia. (See also Appendix A: Commissioner's presentations.) The VSACT team participated in Commission-supported community events such as the 2019 Multicultural Festival and Reconciliation in the Park 2019. Separately, the team sponsored the Stand against Family Violence soccer tournament coordinated by Canberra's African communities; and attended the ACT government market day for domestic violence support services. 123 Annual Report 2018-19 VSACT staff at the National Sorry Day bridge walk in May 2019, including VOCC Heidi Yates (second from right). 124 ACT Human Rights CommissionPublic Advocate, Children and Young People Commissioner Engagement with children and young people Approximately one quarter of all Canberrans are aged under 18 years so the importance of hearing what children and young people have to say should not be under-estimated. When engaging with children and young people, the PACYPC emphasises that they are the experts in their own lives. Children and young people should be recognised as capable contributors and impressive innovators, noting that we will only reap the benefits of their expertise if we value them and take the time to really hear what they are telling us. PACYPC Jodie Griffiths-Cook (left) at the Commission's stall at Namadgi School in March 2019, following the launch of the ACT Government agreement with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community. Consultations with children and young people ACT Year 7 health check On 28 March 2019, the PACYPC consulted with a group of Year 8 students to hear their views about the design and roll out of a proposed ACT Government health check for Year 7 students. The students gave valuable insights to consider for the implementation of the health check including about obtaining informed consent from students, the importance of safety and support during the check, the need for flexibility, and the type of information that should be provided to students prior to and after the check. The PACYPC is hoping to conduct further consultations with more Year 8 students and will be conducting an evaluation of the program after it has been established. Careers Xpo The Commission again participated in the ACT Careers Xpo in 2018. This event was an opportunity to provide young people with information about human rights and the services of the Commission; talk with young people about career pathways into a human rights organisation; and seek the views of young Canberrans. Thousands of young people stopped to chat, and 471 completed a short online survey. The survey asked for their thoughts about their future, careers, how well they cope with stress, what helps them deal with changes, whether they feel listened to, and whether there are any barriers concerning them about the future or their career. The majority of respondents (75 per cent) felt relatively positive about the future. Half had some idea about the career path they would like to take, and a further 41 per cent indicated they were definite about their career path. Most (65 per cent) also indicated that it was either important or very important for them to follow that career path. The things that young people value most in a career centre on doing something they enjoy and feeling they are contributing, although being financially independent was also a priority for over half of respondents. Most indicated they coped reasonably well with change, indicating that talking with friends/peers and parents/guardians, and doing things they enjoy helped them to do so. Most (93 per cent) also felt they were often or always listened to when talking about their future and career. 125 Annual Report 2018-19 Some responses indicated concerns about what might lie ahead: \"I don't feel like my career path has many mainstream options.\" \"I find it hard to get a good job idea.\" \"People expect us to know what we want to be and sometimes we can freak out and think that we will fail in life if we don't know what will happen.\" \"At this age, it is hard to find what it is you are passionate about.\" \"I want to travel but not sure how to fund it.\" \"It's scary growing up in a society with so many things like climate change and trump. It's hard to maintain optimism sometimes. The price of houses and things is also scary.\" Some expressed their thanks for being given the opportunity to provide their thoughts: \"Fantastic survey, so excited and so much to choose from.\" \"This was a very good survey.\" \"Good survey.\" Others expressed their thoughts about human rights: \"I strongly encourage you to support freedom of speech over limiting the speech of others.\" \"Human rights should be the same for everyone no matter the situation.\" Young people also contributed to a collaborative artwork of a tree which celebrated their views of the future. Each part of the tree reflected different questions: Leaves: What do you see yourself doing in the future? Trunk: What are some of the things that will help you get there? Roots: What supports keep you strong during times of change?Some young people articulated a broad range of career choices they were interested in pursuing. Others spoke about travelling, helping others and being happy. To help them get there, young people mentioned attending university, working hard, being healthy and support from family and friends. Family and positivity were mentioned in as factors that keep young people strong. The PACYPC is analysing the responses from the past three years of engaging with young people at the Careers Xpo and, together with information from the 2019 Careers Xpo, will generate a report. ANZCCG survey Ahead of the meeting of Australian and New Zealand Children's Commissioners and Guardians (ANZCCG) in Canberra in May, the PACYPC developed and disseminated a national survey of children and young people to obtain their views about the priorities for ANZCCG members. Given the timing of the meeting also coincided with a Federal election, the survey sought the views of children and young people about what the Australian government could do to make Australia better for children and young people. Although the survey was distributed nationally, an overwhelming proportion of responses were received by children and young people from the ACT. Overall, 487 responses were received, with 479 of these respondents indicating where they lived. Of the 479 respondents who indicated where they lived, 364 (74.74 per cent) lived in the ACT. Of the 364 ACT respondents, 361 indicated their age with 59.56 per cent (215) being aged 11-14 years and 23.27 per cent (84) aged 15-18 years. ANZCCG priorities All 364 ACT respondents answered the first question, indicating which of the existing ANZCCG priorities they considered to be most important: how to make things better for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children and young people ensuring decision makers listen to children and young people; and that the get to have a say how young people are treated in youth detention making sure organisations keep children and young people safe ending violence against children and young people getting people in the community to think about what they can do to keep children and young people safe and well. 126 ACT Human Rights CommissionKey themes 314 ACT respondents (86.26 per cent) provided a response to at least one of three open-text survey questions: What else do you think Commissioners and Guardians should work on to make life better for children and young people? (this followed a question where respondents were asked to indicate which of the current ANZCCG priorities they thought were important) This year there is going to be an election in Australia. What is one thing you want politicians to do to make Australia better for children and young people? Is there anything else you would like to tell your Commissioner or Guardian? For the ACT, the highest potential number of open-text responses that could have been provided was 1062. 776 open-text responses were received from ACT respondents. The categories that elicited the greatest number of responses over the three (3) open-text questions are as follows: Education and development (129 responses - 16.62 per cent) Health and wellbeing (114 responses - 14.69 per cent) Giving voice to children and young people (113 responses - 14.56 per cent) Safety and violence (101 responses - 13.02 per cent) Climate change (62 responses - 7.99 per cent) The remaining responses covered a broad range of issues including political process, activities and services, homelessness, employment and economics, immigration and refugees, discrimination, bullying, LGBTIQ+, transport, technology, the future, and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander issues. A full report of this survey consultation will be written in 2019-20.Children's Week awards In Children's Week each year, the PACYPC presents the Children and Young People Commissioner's Award to a child or young person whose contribution to their peers and/or community reflects strong social justice values. With many deserving nominees, the decision is always a difficult one. In 2018, the PACYPC presented her award to Lara Parkes. In response to her own illness, Lara became a strong advocate for Ronald McDonald House, championing her peers to raise awareness of, donate to, and volunteer for the organisation that supported Lara and her family when they needed it most.

This is being redeveloped as the Young Thinker initiative, which will be launched in late 2019 and will offer opportunities for children and young people to voice their thoughts and opinions to the PACYPC about issues of interest to them. These views will inform the PACYPC's ongoing work and advocacy.
