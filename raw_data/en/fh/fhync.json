Mix & Match Therapy Options Adjustments Adjustments combine chiropractic techniques, naturopathic techniques, and respiratory methods to adjust and align bones. This increases joint range of motion and nerve flow, reduces pain, facilitates alignment of the body, and improves posture and body mechanics. BioEnergetic Assessment A BioEnergetic Assessment (BEA) is an energetic (biofield) assessment of the body to assist in determining location and severity of blockages, energy leaks, stagnation, cords, entities, or build-up of energetic debris. **This therapy option can be done remotely. CranioSacral Therapy Craniosacral Therapy (CST) is a hands-on-therapy that releases restrictions and moves fluids in the nervous and lymphatic systems, aligns bone, muscles, tissues (organs), and the energetic body. CST improves the function of the nervous system, the immune system, reduces physical pain, unwinds tension and more. To learn about additional conditions and symptoms it can treat, visit the Upledger Institute [ [https://www.upledger.com/therapies/index.php](https://www.upledger.com/therapies/index.php) ] * Eligibility: A person should NOT receive CST if they have an active cancer diagnosis, during the first-trimester of pregnancy, and any person who has had a stroke or heart attack in the last 6 months. Fire Cupping Fire cupping involves the use of specialized glass cups and fire to create suction on the skin to enhance circulation, address muscular tension/issues, relieve pain, and extract toxins from the body. Additional benefits include: improved joint mobility, blood and lymph circulation, and opening areas of stagnation and compression. Cupping will likely leave pink, red, or purple circular marks on the area where cups have been placed (*). Some patients will feel sore or tired after a treatment. We encourage a foot bath post-cupping to draw mobilized toxins out of the body and to reduce their effect or chance of reabsorption. (*) If a patient has large, unaddressed build-up of stored physical and/or emotional toxins, there may be a more extreme reaction (deeper coloration, longer-lasting marks, vapors, minor blistering, minor bleeding, or other fluid extraction) when mobilization is initiated. Gemstone Meridian Therapy Gemstone Meridian Therapy (GMT) is the use of medical-grade gemstones on the body and throughout the energetic biofield, integrating intuition and acupuncture points for placement. GMT promotes energetic flow and mental/emotional stabilization, accentuates spiritual growth, and revitalizes physical body tissues. **This therapy option can be done remotely. Gua Sha & Herb-Infused Gua Sha Massage Gua Sha is a massage technique that utilizes a specialized tool to create a temporary trail of micro-bruising. It raises wei qi (benefits the immune system), relieves tight muscles, relieves muscle-tension-induced nausea and headaches, promotes relaxation of the nervous system, reduces muscle or joint pain and stiffness, improves posture, and increases range of motion. Herb-Infused Gua Sha Massage utilizes a CBD and herb-infused medicinal salve in place of standard massage oil to target chronic pain. Intuitive & Traditional Acupuncture Traditional Chinese Acupuncture is used to address specific symptoms and their cause(s) by balancing and healing the meridians (part of the body's energy system). At GEMC, we combine the traditional approach with our intuitive skills to provide an energetically-guided treatment. This treatment can decrease pain, smooth the flow of qi (energy), reduce heat in the meridians, balance a person's state of being (yin and yang), and facilitate reversal of health concern(s). Intuitive Body Work A specialized form of body-work which combines physical massage (hands and tools) with BioEnergetic medicine (reading, interpreting, and applying BioEnergy tools, such as GMT, Acupuncture and PH). Benefits include muscle and other soft tissue mobilization, opening/ releasing emotions and physically tight or tense areas, enhances flow of blood, nerves and meridians, and supports biofield health. Mayan Massage (MAM / MUM) Mayan Abdominal Massage, also known as Mayan Uterine Massage, is a therapeutic abdominal massage which can also facilitate healthy function and placement of the uterus. MAM benefits include improved bowel habits, prostate health, female fertility, and helps work through mental-emotional health concerns such as anxiety and PTSD. For mental-emotional concerns, MAM pairs very well with gemstone meridian therapy. MAM modifications include a \"full-body\" Mayan treatment. This includes the treatment described above, plus a lower leg and foot reflexology massage, and a body wrap (a gentle, light-pressured wrap, from head to feet). Medical Marijuana Certifications A Medical Marijuana (MMJ) Certification is a certificate necessary to obtain an MMJ card, which is valid for 2-years. An MMJ card is required to legally purchase medical marijuana (stronger doses and better quality for less money) at a dispensary in Arizona. For Arizona regulation details, see the Arizona Department of Health Services website ( [https://azdhs.gov/licensing/medical-marijuana/index.php](https://azdhs.gov/licensing/medical-marijuana/index.php) ) MMJ can assist with the alleviation of the following qualifying conditions: - Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) - Crohn's disease - Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) - Agitation of Alzheimer's disease Cancer Glaucoma Hepatitis C - Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) MMJ can also assist with the alleviation of the following qualifying conditions: - Chronic or debilitating disease/medical condition, or the treatment of a chronic or debilitating disease/medical conditions which cause: - Cachexia or wasting syndrome - Severe and chronic pain - Severe nausea - Seizures, including epilepsy characteristic - Severe or persistent muscle spasms, including those characteristic of multiple sclerosis What to Expect: Please contact GEMC for required documents, duration, pricing, and for further details. There are separate fees for AZ State and doctor visits. Muscle Testing An assessment technique to look at areas (physical, emotional/mental/subconscious and energetic) which may be contributing to a patient's health concerns. Based on a muscle's reflexive response, we can determine which treatment options (supplements, homeopathics, etc.) a patient may respond to best. It can be combined with labs and clinical findings to further support treatment details. **This therapy option can be done remotely. Pranic Healing Therapy Pranic Healing (PH) is an energy therapy in the Reiki family that directs the body's innate ability to heal itself. PH therapy cleanses, redirects, balances, and boosts a patient's prana (i.e. qi or life-energy). PH can address mental/emotional/physical symptoms, and spiritual concerns (e.g. revitalize the aura and release energetic cord attachments). It can also assist those struggling with giving and receiving love, feeling a connection to life, their purpose, or to a Higher Power. **This therapy option can be done remotely. Sovereignty Counseling (SC) Sovereignty Counseling (SC) (SC) is NOT like regular or traditional counseling. It utilizes a new approach to explore, restructure and empower core mental, emotional, spiritual, and physical patterns. Issues and trauma from a person's life-story create unhealthy patterns which lead to chronic conditions. SC facilitates breaking free from such toxic beliefs and destructive behaviors promoting optimal health and the enjoyment of a new and improved mindset. SC integrates other mind-body therapies/mental health techniques, including but not limited to: holographic imagery, memory work, breathing techniques, partswork, inner-child work, and guided-meditation. **This therapy option can be done remotely. Time with the Doctors This includes medical visits, lab result reviews, physical exams, supplement reviews, questions and clarifications. All first-time patients seeking medical care must complete an initial visit (80-minutes) and complete new patient paperwork prior to the visit. Please visit the \"For Patients\" tab for more information. Doctor visits range from 20 to 80 minutes and the following are some of the items that can be accomplished during that time: - Detailed look at immediate concerns - Relevant physical examination(s) - Short and long-term goal setting/ coaching - Tailored treatment plan (nutritional supplements, dietary recommendations, herbal pills and teas, homeopathics, home-care routines, other therapies, etc.) - Connecting patients to trusted specialists and other practitioners - Treatment plan modifications - Managing most pharmaceutical prescriptions and weaning off as applicable - Reviewing health and goal progress - Lab results **This therapy option can be done remotely, unless in-person physical exam is needed. Trigger Point Therapy Trigger points are knots or points of tightness where muscle fibers stick together, resulting in pain and/or stiffness, and accumulation of cellular waste and toxins which can reduce blood, lymphatic and nerve flow. Trigger Point Therapy (TPT) is the therapeutic release of such knots. In addition to correcting the issues listed above, it can also increase flexibility and range of motion, and improve muscular strength and endurance. Speciality Items Custom Homeopathic Box Homeopathic medicine functions with the human body because both use energetic frequencies. We can capture a person's energetic signal using a specialized device and use the signal to balance and revitalize the body's energy. This allows the body to return to a healthy, more vibrant state. Detox Laser A red-light, soft laser is applied over body tissues (full body, scars or specific area of the body) to move lymphatic fluid, neutralize toxins and heavy metals, and to promote healing. Grounding Salt Blocks Himalayan salt blocks are warmed and applied to the feet to help ground the patient, and further stabilize detox processes. It can be combined with gemstones to the feet and works best when done after a foot bath treatment. Ionic Detox Foot Baths An Ionic Foot Bath treatment is a gentle, warm foot bath to remove substances that can cause negative effects to the body. These include heavy metals, yeast, pollutants, pesticides, cellular wastes, and bi-products of medications. Benefits typically experienced are: improved sleep, energy, mental clarity, focus, supporting a healthy weight, and symptom/pain relief. IVs, Mini-IV's (\"pushes\"), and Injections GEMC has developed its own gem-essence-infused IV nutrients and uses them to create IV blends. Our carefully designed infusions address the most common symptoms and conditions that stress our systems. The doctors also make custom blends specific to a person's needs when therapeutically advised. GEMC offers four primary gem-essence-infused IV's: - Hydration IV: a bag of hydrating fluids for when the AZ weather dries you out. - Nerve Food: nervous system rejuvenation with B-vitamins, Folic Acid, and Magnesium for relaxation. - Immunity Cleanse Reboot: for faster recovery from illness and to support your body's ability to remove chronic inflammation, seasonal allergies and environmental toxins with key nutrients including vitamin C, glutathione and alpha-lipoic acid. - Feel Good: These minerals improve your lymphatic system, muscles, mood, mental health, and more. Includes calcium, zinc and magnesium. Injection therapy is also available when recommended, based on symptoms, a medical visit, and/or lab findings. Patch Phototherapy Patch Phototherapy consists of adhesive patches that are applied to the skin on acupuncture points or other specific points of the body. The patches utilize the latest phototherapy science and bridge with nanotechnologies to harness the body's natural self-healing mechanisms. Patch types include: anti-inflammatory, pain-alleviation, antioxidant/immune system boost, sleep support, energy boost and stem-cell health. "}
