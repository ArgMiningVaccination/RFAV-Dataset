So when six future physi - cians arrived in Traverse City in late June to begin their final two years of medical school, they were greeted with great enthusiasm and excite - ment. The six students comprise the inau - gural class of the seventh Michigan State University College of Human Medicine (MSU CHM) community clinical campus. It is the medical school's first new campus in 30 years, and joins physician-training pro - grams already in place at Munson, including Munson Medical Center's Family Practice Residency program. Munson Medical Center also currently serves as the base hospital for 10 MSU College of Osteopathic Medicine (COM) third- and fourth- year students. Additionally, the hos - pital hosts about 50 visiting students from other medical schools and MSU students whose clinical campus is elsewhere, but request to complete elective rotations at Munson. \"This is an exciting opportunity for hospitals in the Munson Healthcare System and physicians in northern Michigan to be actively involved in training the next generation of physi - cians, \" said Doug Deck, President and CEO of Munson Healthcare. Munson Healthcare Regional Foun - dation provided a $50,000 grant last year to help establish the new MSU CHM campus. This year's Centurion Drive provided local physicians with an opportunity to support Physician in Training Programs at Munson. During the coming year, the six students will complete eight-week rotations in family medicine, surgery, obstetrics, pediatrics, psychiatry, and internal medicine, working alongside local physicians in hospitals, clinics, and physician offices. Meet Our New Physicians in Training Her Heart is in Honduras During high school, Colleen Lane trav - eled to Honduras with a group de - livering funds to Hurricane Mitch victims. She's gone back to Honduras nine times to work in a pediatric AIDS hospice. \"Originally I thought I was more interested in the public policy side of things, \" she said. \"Then as I was working with physicians and nurses, I was increasingly frustrated that I didn't know enough to make the kind of difference I wanted to make. I decided I didn't want to be the person who arranged to have a doctor come a year from now - I wanted to be the doctor. \" Colleen's goal is to return to Hon - duras as a physician. \"The situation is getting better. They've turned our morgue into a computer room because the children aren't dying anymore, \" she said. Colleen was raised in Grand Rapids and has a bachelor's degree in Span - ish from Loyola University. She's delighted to be in Traverse City where she can interact with the local Span - ish-speaking population. \"I'm really excited about the week we will spend at the migrant clinic, \" she said. 2\"The caliber of these students is extremely high, and physicians here are eager to assist in their education.\" Daniel Webster, MD Community Assistant Dean 73'The Perfect Day' A native of Modesto, Calif., Brett Etchebarne is, in fact, already a doctor. Brett has a PhD in Animal Science from Michi - gan State. So what's he doing in a hospital for humans? \"It's hard to get into medical school, \" he said. \"I was trying to keep all my career options open. I grew up among almond orchards and cows, so I thought if I didn't get into medi - cal school, I could be a professor, do research, or go back home and work with animals. \" Brett earned bachelor's and master's degrees in biology from Stanford University, where he also recently worked as a National Institutes of Health Immunology Postdoctoral Fellow studying bone marrow trans - plantation histocompatibility diseas - es. He deferred medical school twice to undertake research projects, and then took six months off to backpack from Morocco to Fiji. \"I knew it would be a long time before I would have that kind of freedom again. \" Last summer he worked in a medi - cal clinic in Guatemala. \"It was pretty much paradise. I appreciate the tech - nology we have here, but it also made me realize you can solve problems without spending so much money. I think that's what medicine will come back to. My long-term goal is to do a month a year doing medical work someplace else. \" Brett wants to pursue primary care - either family practice, emergency medicine, or hospital medicine. Future Docs: 'There is Nothing More Rewarding than Helping People' \"There is nothing more rewarding than helping people, \" he said. \"Medi - cine offers the same challenges as research, only 15 times a day you get a new challenge. Y ou get to solve complex problems all day long. It's hard work, but it's interesting all the time and at the end of the day, you've helped people and you feel good. It's the perfect day. \" Coming Home The timing of the new medical cam - pus in Traverse City couldn't have been better for Anna Sleder . It meant she could come home. Anna gradu - ated from Traverse City West Senior High in 2001. Since then, she has earned a bachelor's degree in political science and health science from Kalamazoo College, and a master's degree in hu - man genetics from Tulane University in New Orleans, La. Two days after arriving at Tulane, Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast region. Anna joined the Red Cross, became certified in disaster assis - tance, and worked as a volunteer coordinator in Alabama and Missi- ssippi for a year. Anna ultimately wants to practice medicine in Traverse City. \"I always wanted to be a physician because the role allows an individual to be a car - ing member of the community unlike any other profession, \" she said. \"I always enjoyed studying the sciences and working with people, so a career in health is a natural fit. I am excited to realize that dream in my hometown, Traverse City.\" Anna Sleder, MSU CHM student On their first day of orientation, third year medical students practiced suturing pig knuckles - because Community Assistant Dean Dan Webster, MD, wanted to give them something \"fun\" to do. Being able to spend her final two years of medical school here was an unexpectedly pleasant bonus for Anna and her family. \"I am really happy to be back, \" she said. continued on page 44 continued from page 3 Hands On Medicine T ony Bozzio of Tahoe City, Calif. has a bachelor's de - gree in biology from the University of Utah. He spent two years with the Internal Medicine Department researching nicotine addiction and other lung problems as part of a lung health study that will soon be published. \"It was good experience to work with people, draw blood, do short physicals, and do pulmonary function tests, \" he said. But he doesn't intend to practice in pulmonology. Tony expects to become an orthopedic surgeon. \"My parents are both in health care - my dad is a physical therapist so I'm drawn to orthopedics. I like to do things that are more hands on. \" The Traverse City medical campus appealed to Tony because he loves outdoor recreation - especially skiing and bike riding. \"I couldn't be happier. It is so nice to be here and people seem to be so excited to have us here. They've taken great care of us. \" Keeping Options Open Maybe it was the \"Visible Man\" model kit he got for Christmas when he was six. Dan Learned of Paso Robles, Calif. can't remember a time when he didn't want to be a physician. \"I've always liked the science of it, \" he said. Dan's grandfathers were both anes -thesiologists. Surgery interests him, but he's keeping his options open as he explores specialties. After graduating from the University of California Irvine with bachelor's degrees in anthropology and bio- logical sciences, Dan took a year off while applying to medical schools. He worked as an EMT learning the ropes of pre-hospital care and emergency transportation. \"It helped me understand the coordination it takes to make health care the best it can be for the patient, \" he said. He also worked as an airline baggage handler so he could travel econo- mically to Europe, Mexico, the Caribbean, and make a fourth trip to a medical mission in Peru. Dan shares a passion for international travel and medical work with his fianc\u00e9e, Christina Pyo, also a third- year medical student in Traverse City. The two met in middle school and have walked parallel paths toward careers in medicine. Great One-on-One Learning Christina Pyo was first exposed to children who lack basic medical care while staying at a Mexican orphanage during a high school community outreach trip. \"Medicine is appealing because it offers such diverse options with diverse patient populations, \" she said. Last summer, she witnessed the over - whelming gratitude and reception received by physicians visiting Peru. \"That is our inspiration - we want to travel and practice medicine. It's really rewarding because so many people don't get the medical care we get. \" Christina holds a bachelor's degree in biological sciences from the University of California Davis. She attended State University of New Y ork Upstate Medical University in Syracuse before transferring to Michigan State University. She's extremely happy with her choice and the experiences she's having in Traverse City. \"I was a little worried because we are the first set of students, but Dr. Webster and Christy (LaVene, Community Administrator) are working really hard to make sure everything is on track for us, \" she said. \"The physicians here are really excited about teaching us and we have so much one-on-one interaction. It's really a good way to learn and it makes you want to be prepared every day. \" Need New Physicians STAT Becoming a physician takes at least 11 years of schooling. By next year, Michigan will have a shortage of 900 physicians; by 2020 the state will have a shortage of 6,000 physicians. 90% of Michigan physicians reside in 20 of the state's 83 counties. Michigan's physician workforce shortage is 50 percent higher than the national average. 36% of physicians are older than 55. Michigan State Medical SocietyFuture Docs: 'It's Really a Good Way to Learn' 5New Surgical Robot Joins Munson's Operating Room Team Breakthrough surgical technology is now being used at Munson Medical Center to perform select surgeries, saving some patients the inconve - nience and expense of traveling out of the area. Munson Medical Center has installed the da Vinci\u00ae robotic surgical system, which is becoming an important tool in prostate cancer surgery and hysterectomies. The da Vinci system is used in 95 percent of prostatectomies and 20 percent of hysterectomies in Michigan. There are 39 da Vinci systems in Michigan, but until now, none have been located north of Midland. \"When feasible, it is our goal to provide the most advanced care and to reduce residents' need to travel for health care, \" said Robert Sprunk, MD, Chair of the Munson Medical Center Board of Trustees. The system is particularly effective in selected cases that previously re - quired open surgery. Patients benefit from shorter hospital stays, less pain, less risk of infection, less blood loss, fewer transfusions, less scarring, faster recovery, and a quicker return to normal daily activities. How it Works Seated comfortably at a console a few feet away from the patient, the surgeon views a magnified, high- resolution 3D image of the operative field. As the surgeon manipulates controls, state-of-the-art robotic and computer technologies translate hand, wrist, and finger movements into precise micro-movements of miniaturized instruments on four A new tool: Patients express especially high satisfaction with their outcomes following surgery with da Vinci . An Investment in the Future In addition to advancing patient care, purchase of the $1.6 million da Vinci is expected to enhance recruitment of urologists and OB/GYN physicians in coming years. All urology fellows are now trained on da Vinci , making the technology a requirement for future recruitment in this specialty. Philanthropy plays an important role in Munson Healthcare's ability to keep current with advancing technology.

The system cannot be programmed or make decisions on its own. Every surgical maneuver is performed with direct input from the surgeon. Why it's Called da Vinci The system is named for Leonardo da Vinci, who drew the first plans for a robot. The da Vinci system simulates open surgery by providing surgeons with highly enhanced detail and precision. The artist used unparalleled anatomical accuracy and three-dimensional details to bring his masterpieces to life. What the surgeon seesExtending Special Thanks to Friends of the Foundation Desiree Worthington, President of the Munson Healthcare Regional Foundation and Paul Oliver Foundation, responds to recent questions about a new program offered by the Foundation. What are some of the benefits for members? When a member is a patient at Munson Medical Center, one of our staff will visit, share a care package, and wait with family. In addition, members receive invitations to donor appreciation events, lectures, and tours. Upon receiving their membership cards, a few of our members mentioned to us that it is comforting to know they can count on us until family members can arrive. But perhaps the most important benefit to members is the knowledge that their generosity has made a positive impact on the success of our health care system. I don't want to amend my will, is there a simple way to become a Friend of the Foundation member? Designating Munson Medical Center, Munson Hospice, or Paul Oliver to receive all or a portion of a qualified retirement plan through your estate is one of the easiest ways to become a member. Any 401k, 403b, IRA, or Roth IRA is eligible - and this can be accomplished with just a change of beneficiary. Please contact the Foundation at (231) 935-6482 for steps on how to make this happen. What if I intend to include Munson Healthcare in my will, but want to keep it confidential? Please be assured that we treat any information about your plans very confidentially. Some Heritage Circle members have chosen to remain anonymous. This means they aren't listed in our Focus newsletter or on our donor walls; however, they still may choose to receive the benefits of the Friend of the Foundation program. What can you tell me about the Friend of the Foundation Program? All gifts, no matter the size, are important in helping further our mission. Your chari - table support helps improve health care for all residents and visitors in our northern Michigan communities. The Foundation has developed several programs over the years to show appreciation to donors. One recently developed program, Friend of the Foundation , focuses on those who have generously gone \"above and beyond\" with a significant annual gift or through their estate plans. As a way of recognizing and thanking these extraordinary donors, Friend of the Foundation members receive some added attention from Foundation staff while accessing our health care system. Consider us a guide through what can sometimes feel like the maze of health care. How does it work? As with all our philanthropic activities, we conduct the Friend of the Foundation program in accordance with HIPAA regula - tions and Munson policies regarding the use of protected health information. Members are given a card, which lists a private phone number for the Foundation staff member on call. When called, usu - ally before a planned procedure or during an emergency, we will act as a member of your support team, as would a family friend. How can I qualify as a Friend of the Foundation member for 2009-10? This program is available to those who make a future gift commitment through their estate plan or charitable gift annuity (Heritage Circle members). It is also avail - able to any donor who gives an outright annual gift of $10,000 to Munson Medical Center, Paul Oliver Memorial Hospital, or Munson Hospice.Munson Healthcare hospitals depend on charitable support from our communities to succeed. Your donation helps provide award-winning care. Please feel free to use the attached envelope to make a gift with lasting impact. 67Providing outstanding emergency and diagnostic services in local communities is a long-standing goal of Munson Healthcare. Community members make that goal possible and successful by contributing to capital projects and by using services that are close to home. Community support continues to be key. A $2.4 million improvement project at Paul Oliver is being com - pleted in phases. Phase I, including a $750,000 digital mammography suite, is complete. Women in the Benzie County area now have access to technology that is available in only 15 percent of hospitals in the nation. Funds for the $1 million Phase II are currently being raised and will support hospital renovations, equip - ment and technology upgrades, and safety improvements. Specifically, the Emergency Department (ED)will be renovated to better triage and serve emergency patients. The hospital's acute care beds will be relocated to the ground floor, adjacent to the ED. This will allow for efficient care and staff monitoring of acute patients, as well as closer proximity to ambulanc - es for those transferring to Munson Medical Center. Only about five percent of ED patients transfer - the remainder receive the care they need at Paul Oliver. All donations to Paul Oliver Founda - tion are used for POMH projects. For more information, call (231) 352-2266 or (866) 927-6482.When someone you love is injured, the first question that usually races through your mind is \"where is the nearest emergency department?\" Just ask the McClears of Frankfort. Their eight-year-old grandson tum - bled off a skateboard and smacked his head while visiting during Memorial Day weekend. His parents quickly made the 10-minute drive to the Emergency Department at Paul Oli - ver Memorial Hospital in Frankfort. Concerned about internal bleeding, the emergency physician ordered a CT scan. Not too long ago, that would have meant a trip to Traverse City - and a delay in treatment. Since 2004, CT scans have been avail - able in Frankfort thanks to generous community support. The McClears were among those who contributed to the Paul Oliver Foundation's previous $1.2 million fundraising campaign for the purchase of a CT unit. \"This event made that contribution worth more than every penny donated, \" Honnie McClear said. Her grandson's CT scan was per - formed at POMH, transmitted to and read by a radiologist at Munson Medical Center, and results were returned within 30 minutes. The youngster had no internal bleeding. The stitches and staples required to treat his injuries were administered at POMH. Because it was a holiday weekend, the hospital also provided the family with enough antibiotics to use until they could have the child's prescription filled.

When he retired at age 52 from a lucrative career he enjoyed, he wanted a way to say \"thanks\" for his blessings and good life. He found it by becoming a volunteer ambassa - dor at Munson Medical Center. Every Wednesday, Brent takes up his post in Munson's renovated main lobby. He has a clear view of every - one who enters the hospital and can always spot a newcomer. He makes an extra effort to speak to anyone who looks confused or upset. \"We see people from all walks of life, and even though they are a diverse group, everybody is the same when they walk though the door - they're all concerned, \" he said. \"People are not here because they want to be here. They're not thinking like they normally would. We try to put them at ease. \" Brent is one of more than 400 active volunteers who help Munson Medi - cal Center maintain its high quality. During 2008, volunteers provided $1.16 million worth of time and service to the hospital. Whenever Brent thinks it may be helpful, he escorts patients or visitors to their destination. \"One lady wanted us to paint colored lines on the floor so she could find her way. She thought we should get the VFW to come in and paint the lines. I said, 'Tell you what - I'll be your interactive line and you can talk to me while we go' . \" Long before Brent became a Mun - son ambassador, he wanted to teach kindergarten. After earning a teach - ing degree from Eastern Michigan University, he was assigned to older students in an Ypsilanti school as a student teacher. Six months into the job, he realized he couldn't make enough money to support a family. He took a job with Shell Oil Compa - ny as a maintenance man and worked his way up in the company, eventu - ally becoming supervisor of surface operations. Brent worked for Shell for 29 years. When Shell sold its Michigan hold - ings in 2003, the company offered him a choice: he could work on an offshore platform in Louisiana, or he could re - tire with full benefits and an incentive package. It wasn't a difficult choice. Even though life has been good to him and he's grateful for his healthy family, on the rare day when he's feeling down, coming to Munson and witnessing the challenges and the joys he sees helps him put life into perspective.\"It's fulfilling, \" he said. \"It helps keep me grounded. \" As a group, Munson volunteers have partnered with Munson Healthcare Regional Foundation to donate more than $2 million to projects by raising funds through special events and the Munson Gift Shop. Volunteers also provide scholarships to area students preparing for medical careers. Brent Koltvedt: Volunteering at Munson Medical Center helps keep him \"grounded.\"Volunteer Puts Gratitude into Action \"Every year, volunteers are among the hospital's strongest backers with both their time and financial support, \" said Theresa Stachnik, Manager of Volun - teer Services. \"We greatly appreciate all they do. \" T o learn more about becoming a volunteer, contact Stachnik at (231) 935-7455.9Healing Kid's Creek: Project Begins in October A section of Kid's Creek that borders Munson Medical Center's campus will receive some intensive care in October. A restoration project will get under - way to improve the appearance and ecological health of Kid's Creek that runs along the hospital's main visitor parking lot on Elmwood and Sixth streets. \"This is our front yard - it's the first impression that people have of Munson Medical Center, \" said Steve Tongue, VP Facilities and Plant Engineering. \"We envision this as a park-like place where people will be able to get rid of some of the stresses involved with visiting and working in a hospital. \" Tongue and Munson President and CEO Ed Ness began discussing the project last summer while walking about the hospital grounds. Munson assembled experts from the Water - shed Center and the Grand Traverse Conservation District to plan the project. \"We thought we would just research other urban creek restoration projects and follow their Rendering by Mark Meyer, Munson Medical Center Facilities Design project, but community members and Munson employees also are invited to participate - either through hands-on work or monetary support. A lead gift of $60,000 has been pledged by a local family foundation, and naming opportunities are being developed for other donors who would like to honor or remember loved ones. Kid's Creek is on the State of Michi - gan's Impaired Waters list because sediment runoff and excess sand contribute to its poor water flow and reduced aquatic habitat. \"One of Munson's values is steward - ship, and that includes taking care of our environment, \" Ness said. \"This creek is a wonderful resource and I'm happy it's getting the attention it needs. When this project is done, it will provide a very inviting place for our visitors and employees to enjoy. \" T o learn more about the project and how you can help, contact Beth Karczewski, Foundation Leadership Giving Specialist, at (231) 935-7689. lead, but we found very little informa - tion, \" Tongue said. \"So we decided we would create the model. \" That model will be shared with the community during a public work - shop on Sept. 19 at the Boardman River Nature Center. \" A lot of people have streams running through their backyards and may be interested in learning how to do restoration and keep the watershed healthy, \" Tongue said. \"We will talk about urban watershed restoration and how the Munson project will go. \" Tongue also will meet in Septem - ber with local master gardeners and employees at Munson Medical Center and Munson Community Health Center to solicit their support. \"We will need about 200 volunteer hours during the first phase of the project in October, \" Tongue said. The project will create a buffer zone between the parking lot and the creek of non-ornamental plantings that will not require fertilizer or maintenance. Professional landscapers will com - plete portions of Munson's $110,000 10Wayne Lobdell credits his business success to two things: the example of his father's work ethic, and a ninth grade cheerleader who looked past his poor circumstances to see his potential. \"Terry taught me the importance of education - her support and example changed everything, \" he said. From the beginning, Wayne and Terry Lobdell have operated as a team. With Terry's encouragement, Wayne became the first member of his family to graduate from high school. Together, Terry and Wayne worked their way through Michigan State University. She became a teacher; he obtained a degree in hotel and restaurant management. The Lobdells chose to raise their three sons and daughter in Traverse City in 1972. \"Terry and I placed a lot of importance on where to raise our family, \" he said. Three elements were crucial - a good education sys - tem, good health care, and business development opportunity. \"We've been fortunate to live in a community that is so generous, \" he said. \"Once we reached the point that we were able to do so, we felt it was our responsibility to give back. We play a small part among the many people who have come before us in helping this community. \" Sons Jeff and Greg operate numerous restaurants in Traverse City and else - where. Wayne is a diversified business developer, and is currently Chairman of the Board of Hospitality Restaurant Group (HRG) and a General Partner of Renewable Energy Development (Red One). HRG owns Yum brand restaurants in Buffalo, Rochester, and Syracuse, N.Y . Red One develops natural gas wells on the property of Fort Knox in Kentucky. Wayne also has worked in money management with Lobdell Capital Partners, and works with venture capital investing. Wayne and Terry Lobdell 'Why We Give'Terry and Wayne now enjoy sum - mers in Traverse City and winters in Hillsboro Beach, Fla., where they also are involved in community philanthropy. The family's generous gift to North - western Michigan College resulted in \"Lobdell's, A Teaching Restaurant\" for the Great Lakes Culinary Insti - tute. Wayne and Terry also became members of Munson Healthcare Regional Foundation's Heritage Circle by including Munson Healthcare in their estate plans. All proceeds from Wayne's new memoir, \"Climb from the Cellar: How One Michigan Kid, Born in a Basement, Found His Way Up to the American Dream, \" is benefiting the Boys and Girls Club of America. \"I was fortunate enough to be born in this wonderful country, \" Wayne said. \"Making the choice to be part of this community provided the foundation for our modest success. The success we've had, my wife and I did together. We've tried to give a little bit back here and there. \" T o order Wayne's book online, visit bn.com, or it can be purchased locally at the Omelette Shoppes, Blue Tractor, North Peak, Bowers Harbor Inn, Caf\u00e9 Habana, or Boone's Prime Time Pub in Suttons Bay.

Donations have been designated to Munson Medical Center Immediate Needs, Munson Heart Center, Munson Hos - pice, and Pediatric Specialty Clinics. The Paul Oliver Community appeal seeks support for the hospital's renovation project for the Emergency Department and acute care bed replacement (see story on page 7).This year's Centurion Drive was multi-faceted, from the number of groups solicited to the variety of funds supported. The Munson Healthcare Employee Campaign, the Munson Community Campaign, the Paul Oliver Community Campaign, and the Physician Campaign were all separate components of the annual drive. Munson Healthcare Regional Foun - dation's 2009 Employee Centurion Drive was very successful, raising $99,608 through contributions from 575 employees. Despite challenging economic conditions, more employ - ees pitched in to help patients this year. \"When we compare it to 2008, we had an improvement in dollars raised and in participation, \" said Julie Friley, An - nual Giving and Stewardship Special - ist. \"This year, the need for financial support is greater than ever, and I'm impressed by the way Munson em - ployees stepped up to the challenge - this really is a caring community. \" Primarily a mail campaign, gifts also were accepted online - a method used by 60 percent of employees (see How to Give Online) .

Dawn Grumley died six years later at age 33. One of the things Alicia remembers clearly about that time was the assistance and love her family received from the community. \" At the time, my brothers and I attended Grand Traverse Area Catholic Schools, \" she said. \"Our family was overwhelmed by sup - port. People brought us meals. They offered to take my brothers to their sporting events. The community was so amazing to my family. \" Last May, Alicia and fellow mem - bers of the Glen Lake High School graduating class were challenged to complete individual senior projects. They could do anything they wanted, as long as it helped at least one per - son, took a minimum of 25 hours to complete, and stretched them beyond their comfort zone. After a lot of thought and discussion with her friends, she decided to do a walk-a-thon to benefit the Women's Cancer Fund. She solicited pledges from local businesses, friends, and parents.
