Full Story Fall 2011After School Special: The 2011 Alumni Show kicks off Friday, Oct. 14, with a reception and wine tasting from 5-7 p.m. The exhibition, which runs through Dec. 10, will showcase painting, sculpture, photography, video, installation and works on paper by University graduates who live as near as Albany and as far away as New Zealand.Planning for the show began last year with broad outreach to alumni. In response, hundreds of alumni artists submitted digital images of their current work for consideration. Those selected include Fulbright Scholars and Guggenheim Fellows. Their artwork has been exhibited all over the globe and is represented in collections that include the Museum of Modern Art and the Whitney Museum, as well as the University Art Museum collections. Many of the participants teach at colleges and universities throughout the United States. In addition to highlight- ing working alumni artists' individual accomplishments, noted Janet Riker, museum director, the exhibi-tion \"will highlight the strength of the art program at UAlbany and the impact of our alumni on the art world.\" Curator Ken Johnson, M.A.'78, a freelance critic whose reviews appear regularly in The New York Times, wrote an essay for the exhibition's 84-page catalogue. Johnson, author of Are You Experienced? How Psyche-delic Consciousness Transformed Modern Art (2011), will sign the book at the Alumni Weekend Fall Festival. He will also lecture and sign books Nov. 7 at 7 p.m. at the museum. The exhibition is made possible by a generous grant from the Alumni Association through the Grandma Moses Fund and supported by the Office of the President, the Office of the Provost, The University at Albany Foundation, the Ellsworth Kelly Foundation, University Auxil-iary Services (UAS), the College of Arts and Sciences, the Art Department, Shirley W.

Sandra Scolnik, M.F.A. '97 Collective on Tyvek and bathroom fansRukayatu \"Ruky\" Tijani was 5 when she learned about famed jurist Thurgood Marshall's work in the landmark Brown vs. T opeka Board of Educa- tion case. She has dreamed of becoming a lawyer ever since. That day drew closer last May 15 with the Honors College student's graduation summa cum laude from the University at Albany and her acceptance to law school at the University of California, Berkeley. Her divorced mom raised Tijani; her older brother T ommy; and her developmentally disabled brother Abraham, now 17, all alone. Losing T ommy, who had Down Syndrome and died while Tijani was still in high school, \"feeds my passion to succeed,\" said the Coney Island, N.Y, native. Although Tijani, a Resident Assistant, Project Excel mentor/tutor and library work-study at UAlbany, sometimes couldn't afford to go home for the holidays, she would send money to her mother, who lost her job. \"As a mentor and a tutor, it is important for me to tell students who are just going through dif-ficulties: 'I've been there. And I'm a victor, not a victim,'\" said Tijani, who plans a career in entertainment law, civil rights litigation and constitutional law.She finds a way to make things happen. Tijani once confided to her math professor, \"I have no money to afford the book for class, but if you loan me the textbook during your office hours, I'll get that A.\" She did. As campus coordinator for the Law School Admissions Council, Tijani presented workshops each semester about the law school admissions process and resources for students from disadvantaged backgrounds. She was vice president of Phenomenal Voices, a multicul-tural performing arts group, and served as public relations director for the Precizun step team. Tijani, who graduated with a 3.99 G.P .A. and a dual degree in political science and Africana stud - ies, ranked in the top 1 percent of the Class of 2011, won two Spellman awards and was a member of three national honor societies. She credits Makisha Brown and Chris Fernando of Project Excel (officially the TRIO Student Support Services program), as \"pivotal to my academic success. I became the person I am because of all the resources available to me at this University and all the people who truly believed I could be somebody, not because of my obstacles, but despite them.\" \"A Victor, not Carol Olechowski Congratulations to Robert J.

The award, presented by Sweden's Queen Silvia in a ceremony at Stock-holm City Hall, honored the researchers for their study of how and why criminals cease to offend at various turning points in their lives. Sampson is the Henry Ford II Professor of the Social Sciences at Harvard University and a visiting scholar at the Rus-sell Sage Foundation in New York. Laub, currently on leave from the University of Maryland, College Park, has served as director of the National Institute of Justice in Washington, D.C., since July 2010. U.S. Public Health Service Lt. Katrina Mosley, M.P .H.'06 (Spring 2010 UAlbany, \"Un-derstanding Public Health\"), who studied community health and behavioral science, is back home now in Georgia. Formerly stationed with the Food and Drug Administration's New Orleans District Office in Nashville, she moved to her hometown, Atlanta, to work at the FDA 's District Of-fice there, \"which covers North and South Carolina.\" In July 2010, during the Deepwater Hori-zon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, Mosley was deployed to Mobile, Ala., \"where I worked as a medical officer, assist-ing with the logistics of the beach clean-ups along the coast.\" Former volleyball stand- out Ashlee Reed, B.S.'06 (Spring 2007 UAlbany, \"T eam Player\") may be back in T ex-as, but she hasn't forgotten UAlbany. The Austin native, who earned a degree in hu-man biology and psychology, is now completing doctoral studies in physical therapy at Hardin-Simmons University. Reed describes the program as \"one of the most intense in the country, since we go year 'round and finish in two-and-a-half years. But I know it will be worth it!\" Being back in T exas is \"very different,\" but Reed feels right at home: The school's colors are purple and gold. \"There is also an Albany about 20 miles down the road,\" she adds, \"so when I hear on the news, 'In Albany today ...' it still throws me for a loop!\" Mark Schmidt Pernille Toftewww.albany.edu 7 School of Criminal Justice faculty member Frankie Y.

In Forty Acres and a Soggy Grave, released July 26, crime historian Stuart and her fianc\u00e9, John Quinn, travel to Virginia's Eastern Shore for a weekend \"that turns deadly.\" The other books in the series are Death's Favorite Child; A Dead Man's Honor; Old Murders; and You Should Have Died on Monday. Bailey, whose research currently focuses on crime, clothing and American culture, has also completed the first book in \"a new near-future police procedural series set in Albany.\"\"Jordan is a fascinating place to work and live,\" reports U.S. Foreign Service Officer Jeffrey Loree, B.A.'89 (Fall 2007 UAlbany, \"Diplo-matically Speaking - and Listening\"), a cultural attach\u00e9 at the U.S. Embassy in Amman since August 2010. \"Jordanians have a well-deserved reputation for hospitality in a region famous for it. Most have some facility with English, and it is hurting my already limited ability to com-municate in Arabic,\" jokes the Lewiston, N.Y., native, who majored in Chinese at UAlbany and also speaks Japanese, French and Indonesian. Loree's wife, art conservator Hiroko Kariya, is managing \"a wide range of archeological proj-ects\" in Egypt while the couple lives in Jordan. Mark McCarty In the 25 years since its founding, the State University of New York's Center for International Development (SUNY/CID) has had several homes within the SUNY System. But one constant has remained: its mission of \"Con-necting People and Ideas for Integrated Development.\" Based at the University at Albany's Rockefeller College of Public Affairs and Policy since 2007, SUNY/CID combines knowledge with the practice of government and policy-mak-ing to aid foreign countries in strengthening and developing their legislatures. SUNY, UAlbany and Rockefeller College resources; field offices on five continents; and links with donor agencies, local and national governments, institutions of higher learning, and other partners have enabled the cen-ter to merge projects with a government-focused research agenda. As a result, SUNY/CID has implemented more than $200 million in international development projects over the past quarter-century while forging strong relation-ships with legislative bodies around the globe. \"We've had a great impact,\" noted M. Monica Bartoszek, the center's outreach coordinator. \"We've developed a really solid reputation for the work that we do, legislative strengthening and other projects in Bolivia, Afghanistan, Lebanon, Haiti, Kenya, Uganda and many other countries.\" SUNY/CID training, Bartoszek said, is comprehensive, encompassing \"everything from HIV/AIDS education and computer training to learning how to organize public hearings for parliamentary committees.\" Projects range in duration from six months to 10 years. Through internships, UAlbany students like Emily Blakeslee, B.A.'11, participate in SUNY/CID's work. The Binghamton, N.Y., native credits the experience with \"inspiring me to pursue a career in the international non-profit field, specifically focusing on improving the lives and circumstances of women and children.\" Now studying for her M.P .A., Blakeslee, 21, began her internship in September 2010. In the year since, assigned to the home office in Albany, she has \"updated our Web site, Center for INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT Through CID, Emily Blakeslee, B.A.'11, has encountered \"many scholars\" who \"have taught me a great deal and have shared eye-opening firsthand perspectives on development work.\" 8 UAlbany Magazine Fall 2011~~ 25 YEARS OF ACHIEVEMENT ~~ Courtesy SUNY/CID reviewed financial reconciliations, done all types of research, helped coordinate travel plans, worked on document management and assisted with media outreach.

SUNY/CID Senior Associate Mark Baskin, a research professor at Rock-efeller College, has managed parlia-mentary strengthening projects in Iraq, Serbia and Jordan and contributed to projects in Afghanistan and Kenya. Baskin, a Fulbright Fellow in Yugo-slavia in the 1980s, had several other fellowships in the Balkans, and worked for the United Nations as a peacekeep- er in the 1990s and later at a peace- keeping training center in Canada. Attracted to SUNY/CID and Rock- efeller College because \"I thought they brilliantly lend a practical, pedagogical and academic approach to international development and diplomacy,\" he is cur - rently directing a comparative research project on constituency development funds (CDFs), \"policy tools that en- able Members of Parliament to play a role in assisting in service delivery in their constituencies in more than 20 countries, including Kenya, Uganda and Bangladesh.\"The 100-plus SUNY/CID projects implemented in Asia, Africa, Europe, Latin America and the Middle East over the years, ob-served Baskin, \"have dealt with strengthening the capacity of the legislature to serve as a constructive partner in government, economic development, en- vironmental projection, the strengthening of civil soci-ety, the deepening of rule of law and good government, among other things.\" At any given time, Baskin added, \"eight to 12 interns and student fellows help us with our work. They acquire ana-lytical tools and skills that help them establish careers in some aspects of international affairs, government and post-graduate studies, and in the private sector. Former interns have found jobs in Congress and in the executive branch of government.

UAlbany Unite - and the most successful student gift campaign ever. Rather than support one indi- vidual project, UAlbany Unite invited students from various campus organizations to submit videos documenting their groups' work. Donations were then solicited from students' families and friends and from alumni. The idea behind UAlbany Unite, explained UAlbany Vice President for University Development Fardin Sanai, was to provide \"a creative experience and also teach students about philanthropy first-hand.\" In addition to contributing to a cause, Sanai said, students \"were able to learn about the importance of support- ing and promoting their organizations, as well as the University.\" Through UAlbany Unite, donations from more than 600 students, parents, alumni, faculty and staff exceeded $17,000. Sponsorships from University Auxiliary Services (UAS), the Student Association (SA), the Alumni Associa- tion, The University at Albany Foun- dation and The Class of 2011 Book Drive doubled that amount, raising a total of more than $35,000 for the gift. Previously, the largest class gift was the $33,000 the Class of 2009 raised to support the Richard Bailey Memorial Scholarship Fund. During the 2011-12 academic year, participating UAlbany Unite student groups will use their funding to en-hance student life on campus and fur - ther their organizations' missions. The groups include L 'Chaim, Five Quad, Middle Earth, Hillel, the Univer - sity Equestrian T eam, the Ski and Snowboard Club, Women's Self Defense and Fitness (WSDF), Albany Student T elevision (ATV), Mixed Martial Arts, Women's Rugby, Albany Running Exchange, Albany Business Leaders Emerging (ABLE), The Sketchy Characters, and D.R.E.A.M.org.

What's Cookin'? www.albany.edu 11Butera's Tomato Magazine Fall 2011Several years ago, however, Lillien hit upon a unique way to conquer her \"obsession\" with food, maintain a healthy weight, follow a common-sense diet - and help other women to do the same. \"I have a knack for finding products that taste great but are low in calories and fat, and also ways to make homemade food that tastes super-fattening but isn't,\" she says. \"And I love to share my findings and ideas with people. One day, the idea to create sort of an umbrella diet brand from a regular person, as opposed to a doctor or a dietitian, popped into my brain. It needed to be fun and a little sassy, not boring. So Hungry Girl was born.\" Hungry Girl began in 2004 as a free e-mail that went out to fewer than 100 people each day under the head- ing \"Tips and T ricks ... for Hungry Chicks.\" In the years since, Lillien has continued to \"deliver the content in a very personal way,\" serving up to subscribers such artfully titled entree, side-dish snack suggesting low-calorie, low-fat substitutions for packaged foods. Currently, \"the e-mail reaches 1.1 million people daily. And that list has grown 100-percent organically - via word of mouth,\" she notes. As an undergraduate, Lillien planned for a career in entertainment and me- dia, despite having \"no connections in the field at all. I always felt I was a little entrepreneurial, though, and would one day start a business.\" She completed internships at an Albany television sta-tion and at Tutti Frutti, a Long Island \"teen fanzine\" that hired her as editor-in-chief right after gradua-tion. Lillien later worked for Nickel-odeon, then Warner Bros., before Lisa Lillien, B.A.'87 \"Hungry Girl\"What's Cookin'? I always loved food but had a weird relationship with it,\" confesses Lisa Lillien. Growing up on Long Island, N.Y., \"the child of a yo-yo dieter, I was always a little chubby and watching what I ate. In my teens and 20s, I went up and down about 15 pounds.\" At UAlbany, where she majored in communications and minored in business administration, \"I didn't gain the 'freshman 15,' but I definitely wasn't losing weight. I would eat Denny's Grand Slam breakfasts after going out to The Lamp Post - or pizza at 3 a.m. Not ideal!\"By Carol Olechowskiwww.albany.edu 1314 UAlbany Magazine Fall 2011 assuming the Hungry Girl persona full time several years ago. \"The growth of the brand\" has opened many doors for its creator. Lillien has writ-ten a New York Daily News column and five cookbooks (\"all New York Times best sellers - and three No. 1s!\"), including Hungry Girl 300 Under 300: 300 Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner Dishes Un-der 300 Calories. She hosts the \"Hungry Girl\" televi-sion program, airing on both Food Network and the Cooking Channel, and pro-duces \"weekly content\" for Yahoo!, WeightWatchers.com and Redbook magazine. In addition, the California-based Lillien makes personal appearances around the U.S. Her greatest challenge, Lillien finds, is \"juggling all the work. I do have a staff of about 12 people now who work with me on all things HG, but I work so many hours and don't like to say no, and so I have very little free time these days.\" Still, Lillien, who admits to having \"a really big ap-petite,\" always has time to whip up her favorite recipe: \"Lord of the Onion Rings.\" Lord of the Onion Rings Prep: 20 minutes ~ Cooking: 25 minutes Ingredients 1 large onion 1/2 cup Fiber One Original bran cereal1/4 tsp. garlic powder, or more to taste1/8 tsp. onion powder, or more to taste 1/8 tsp. salt, or more to taste black pepper, to taste Directions Preheat oven to 375o. Slice the ends off the onion and remove its outer layer. Cut onion into half-inch-wide slices and separate into rings. Set aside. Using a blender or food processor, grind cereal to a breadcrumb-like consistency. Season crumbs with the spices and transfer to a plate or bowl. Set aside. Pour egg substitute into a small bowl. Prepare a baking sheet (or two) with non-stick spray. Set aside. Using tongs or a fork, dip the onion rings into the egg substitute, shaking each one lightly to remove the excess. Coat each ring with the seasoned crumbs. Evenly place rings on the baking sheet(s). Bake until each ring is crispy outside and soft inside, about 20-25 minutes, carefully flipping rings midway through. Serve with mustard, if desired. Enjoy!

Makes one Important\" By Carol Olechowski As a UAlbany undergraduate, Jeffrey Bank majored in sociology and minored in political science, intending to become a lawyer. But the Long Island native opted for a much different career path. \"My next-door neighbor was a restaurant broker,\" Bank remembers. \"I was looking for a summer job and said, 'I'd love to come work for you in your office.'\" The neighbor suggested instead that Bank go to work in a restaurant. \"I worked the whole summer in three restaurants, learning the business. With no time to spend any money, by the end of the summer, I thought I was rich.\" The restaurant business, Bank decided, \"looked like a fun and interesting career. Why would I go to law school?\" Over the next 10 years, he ran three restaurants on Long Island, selling them to open Artie's Delicatessen in New York City in 1999. Bank, however, \"quickly got bored in a single restaurant.\" Alicart Restaurant Group, a New York-based firm \"offering an exciting and unique spectrum of dining concepts,\" was undergoing some internal changes just as he was looking for a fresh challenge. Bank joined the company and, in 2006, became CEO. Alicart Restaurant Group manages annual sales exceeding $70 million. Its flagship brand, Carmine's - \"NYC's Legendary Family Style Italian Restaurant\" - was established in 1990. Carmine's has two loca- tions in New York City and others in Atlantic City and Washington, D.C., and at the Atlantis in the Bahamas. For 16 Alicart Restaurant Groupyears, Alicart has also managed Virgil's Real BBQ, which is located in Times Square. A 650-seat Virgil's will open this coming November, also in the Atlantis in the Bahamas. Bank travels to the vari-ous restaurants in keeping with his com-mitment to provide \"high-quality dining experiences marked by delicious food, welcoming ambience, great value and superior service.\" One of the best parts of his job, Bank says, is interacting with Alicart's 1,200 employees and watching them grow: \"Some people have been here 21 years, since day one. You'll see someone who started out as a dishwasher and is now a chef, or a director of Operations who was a server years ago. People are promoted from within. I don't want a dishwasher or a host to think that will be his or her only job, but more a possible career path. We call it Alicart University. A lot of our employee growth is organic. \"We do also hire people from outside, and we 'Carminize' them, as well. New hires will succeed if they understand what's expected of them and we provide the right tools for them to do their jobs. It's all about communication. You need to know what's important to people. Everyone likes to make more money, but it's also about quality of life and having time for family and friends.\" Bank's \"great experience\" at Albany \"made me a more effective CEO. In Introduction to Theatre, we helped man- age productions and run a theatre. My Spanish-culture class was extremely interesting. My internship with the New York State Senate was a phenomenal opportunity; it gave me great insight into government and the budget process. The well-rounded liberal arts degree I received at Albany has been a very valuable tool in making me success-ful. Managing people is as important as managing 'the numbers.'\" Bank has continued the learning pro-cess. Early in his career, he discov-ered that \"knowing the business inside and out is the best way to manage it thoroughly. On my first day of work, over 25 years ago, I changed out of my suit and tie and into whites. I wound up washing dishes that day because two dishwashers called in sick. Later, if a waiter didn't come in, I waited tables. There's nothing better than practical experience.\" www.albany.edu 17 Alicart Restaurant GroupKen Denberg, Ph.D.'88 A His Own Amy Halloran, B.A.'90 18 UAlbany Magazine Fall 2011www.albany.edu 19The Cambridge, N.Y., resident has taught rhetoric and composition at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in T roy since 1998. Six years ago, he started teaching creative writing for undergraduates at UAlbany. He also works in the University in the High School program, which allows seniors to earn college credit. \"My position is to evalu-ate the teachers,\" said Denberg, noting that the secondary school students take rigorous, college-level courses. Denberg has lived in Washington County since 1985. The location served his summertime avocation for fly-fishing - Distinguished T eaching Professor Emeritus of English Eugene Garber has long been a fishing partner - and living rurally inspired him to \"use the land,\" as well. The property's Darwin Road address led Denberg to name it Natural Selection Farm. He planted 1,000 blueberry bushes there, along with 200 raspberry plants; the fruits are sold in fresh markets and to restaurants in the Saratoga area. The three-acre vineyard contains 700 vines. Businesses in Saratoga and Washington counties have been enthusiastic supporters of his winery. Denberg made and sold 500 bottles of wine last year. This year, he has 1,700 bottles and anticipates the same response. \"I didn't know you could get a wine this good in New York State,\" one restaurateur told him before ordering a case of Handsome Farmer Red, a dry, full-bod-ied blend of Marquette, St. Croix and Geneva Red grapes. Denberg also makes a blueberry wine and two white wines. \"A lot of people turn their noses up at New York State wine, but within the last five years, people are really learning how to make wine,\" Denberg explains. \"You need to understand how to read the wine as it's coming along. Once you grasp the concept that it's telling you something, you can have the wine analyzed to tell you what to add to it, and to the ground.\" Denberg links his agricultural endeavors to his nonfiction writing, and to reading the works of others, such as Wen-dell Berry, Michael Pollan and John McPhee. In 2005, he received a New York State Council on the Arts Award for his creative nonfiction. What's Cookin'? Ken Denberg, Ph.D.'88 A Vintage All His Own By Amy Halloran, B.A.'90 Writer and teacher Ken Denberg recently added \"vintner\" to his list of occupations.Mark McCarty Mark McCarty20 UAlbany Magazine Fall 2011 The Portland, Ore.-based Reinfeld still loves to cook. But these days, he's a renowned vegan chef, so the meatballs are made with tempeh, and vegetables stand in for the pasta. Vegans, says Reinfeld, \"enjoy fruits, vegetables, grains, seeds, nuts, herbs and spices. Veganism is essentially a vegetarian diet with no dairy or eggs. A strict vegan would not use animal prod-ucts - including leather and fur - at all.\" Reinfeld's \"love of travel and compassion for animals\" led him to veganism, a \"surprisingly easy\" lifestyle to embrace. \"Salads are vegan, so most of us have been eating vegan foods our whole lives. Salsa, guacamole and stir fry are also vegan. There are so many vegan products available that you can create world-class cuisine using only plants, and substituting tofu or tempeh for fish or chicken.\" Years ago, \"I ate lots of different things with- out really thinking about whether they were healthy,\" observes Reinfeld, admitting to a youthful fondness for fast food. \"I wouldn't say I was a picky eater.\" He later began to cultivate more conscientious eating habits. As a pre-law student majoring in philosophy and minoring in business, Reinfeld \"awakened to the joys of travel\" junior year while attending the London School of Eco-nomics. After returning to UAlbany, he applied to New York University for law school, then deferred enrollment for a year to continue his travels in Europe, Asia and the Middle East, absorbing what - and how - people of other cul-tures ate. He attended NYU for a semester but \"decided this wasn't for me. I got rid of most of what wouldn't fit in my car and headed west, not sure where I would land or what I would do.\" Reinfeld landed in San Diego and began his \"cooking career\" in the kitchen of a natural-foods store. Three years later, \"I branched off on my own and started the Blossoming Lotus as a personal chef/consulting service, teaching What's Cookin'? Mark Reinfeld, B.A.'89 Enlightened Chef By Carol learned to cook from the best: \"my mom and my grandfather, Benjamin Bimstein, a famed chef and ice-carver in New York City in the 1950s. I used to love to prepare meatballs and spaghetti,\" he remembers. Mark Reinfeld defines a few vegan food items: spelt: an ancient form of wheat many people find more digestible than whole-wheat flour quinoa: a South American grain - botanically a seed - high in protein and having a nutty flavor tempeh: a cultured soy product used as a meat replacement tamari: a wheat-free soy sauce that adds a rich, flavorful depth to dishes chia seed: a seed high in omega fatty acids and wonderful in pud- dings and other desserts nutritional yeast: a fortified yeast, high in protein and Vitamin B12, that provides a nutty, cheesy fla-vor and rounds out a vegan diet people to cook and providing meals for folks.\" The Blossoming Lotus name - later used for a restaurant Reinfeld opened on Kauai, Hawaii, then for the one he and business partner Bo Rinaldi currently own and operate in Portland - signifies \"evolving consciousness and is a symbol of enlightenment,\" explains Reinfeld. \"T o me, it means to offer an enlightened form of cuisine.\" His career is likewise blos- soming. For those eager to learn more about vegan cuisine, Reinfeld offers Internet cooking workshops and personal lessons for small groups. With Rinaldi, he published the best-selling Vegan Fusion World Cuisine, which \"had a foreword by Dr. Jane Goodall and went on to win nine na-tional awards, including a Gourmand Award for Best Vegetarian Cookbook in the U.S. Bo and I then wrote The Complete Idiot's Guide to Eating Raw with Jennifer Murray.\" Reinfeld, who teamed with Murray again for The 30 Minute Vegan and The 30 Minute Vegan's T aste of the East, is \"now working on my fifth book, The 30 Minute Vegan's T aste of Europe.\" Aside from enjoying wholesome, delicious dishes like Roasted Red Pep-per Hummus (recipe below), \"people who include more vegan foods in their diets often experience relief from such health problems as undiag-nosed allergies to dairy and other products,\" Reinfeld maintains. He once suf-fered from headaches and sore throats but noticed that both maladies \"pretty much disappeared once I became a vegan.\" As a bonus, \"I felt more energy and was able to maintain the weight I was in college.\" At the Blossoming Lotus, Reinfeld serves \"organic and locally grown foods whenever possible. There are so many vegan products - great-tasting cheeses, butters, meat replacements - on the market that it is fairly easy to 'veganize' any dish.\" Roasted Red Pepper Hummus (Courtesy Vegan Fusion World Cuisine)2 red bell peppers (1 cup), roasted 3 cups garbanzo beans, cooked and drained well 3/4 cup tahini, roasted to a creamy consistency 1/4 cup fresh-squeezed lemon juice 3 tablespoons wheat-free tamari or soy sauce 2 teaspoons cumin powder, toasted 1 1/2 teaspoons minced garlic 3/4 teaspoon sea salt, or to taste 3/4 teaspoon black pepper, ground to taste 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper1/2 teaspoon chipotle chile powder (optional) 1/2 teaspoon soy sauce, or to taste (optional) Place roasted pepper in food processor with lemon juice, soy sauce or tamari and olive oil; blend well.

T rimble, B.A.'72, now deceased, in downtown Albany in 1977. The name means \"greenhouse\" in French, and the restaurant is tucked among the capital's tall buildings, with a small greenhouse offering sunny seating and a courtyard allow-ing further access outdoors. La Serre serves continental fare and has private rooms, too, bringing the restaurant's capacity up to 200. While the T rimbles were studying at UAlbany, they worked at L 'Ecole, a little bistro within walking distance of campus. \"The place was very quaint, ahead of its time,\" Anne recalled. The T reffiletti family was in the wholesale grocers business, and Anne's father - whose hard work and example \"gave us a better education than any institution ever could\" - made sure his daughters were formally prepared for whatever line of work they chose. Anne earned an associ-ate's degree in business from the Junior College of Albany and spent a few months in San Francisco before returning to Albany for her bachelor's. She studied education. Geoffrey was an English major. Both of them loved taking film classes with Professor Arthur Lennig. After teaching, T rimble discovered she liked the restaurant business better. She and Geoffrey started La Serre with L 'Ecole's owner, Ken Nierenberg. Their partner left after a year, but La Serre has become an institution, serv-ing the Capitol and other Albany fixtures, including SUNY Central. Long before the wild success of his novel Ironweed, William Kennedy was Geoffrey's advisor. Over the years, the author has made La Serre a part of The New York State Writers Insti-tute, feting writers at dinners there. Relationships such as this, and other contacts made before and after the T rimbles' time at UAlbany, have con-tributed to the restaurant's success. La Serre is busiest during the legisla- tive session. Changes made to lobby-ing laws in the 1980s, T rimble said, permanently affected not only her establishment but the whole restau-rant industry, from produce vendors to valet-parking attendants. She sees the loss in terms that are not strictly financial: \"Politicians were more able to mingle and talk across the aisle\" years ago, T rimble observed. The restaurant business seems to run in T rimble's family. After working in finance, son John came to La Serre when his father passed away, five years ago. Daughter Nicole's restaurant, Porreca's, is in Lake George. Nephew Michael Carney, a star server at La Serre several years ago, continues to tend bar there. Over the years, La Serre has served hundreds of graduation parties. Many UAlbany students have been employed there, especially when The Wellington housed students downtown. What's Cookin'?

Mark McCarty24 UAlbany Magazine Fall 2011 As wife, mother, stepmom, biochemist and multi- tasker, Stephanie Blackwell wears many hats. Thirteen years ago, the Aurora Products Inc. (www. AuroraNatural.com) president and CEO/owner added another: \"entrepreneurial businesswoman.\" Blackwell, who had \"a very sheltered\" upbringing in Kingston, N.Y., never anticipated embracing that role. She earned her baccalaureate degree in science at Wells College, then enrolled at Albany - \"my first exposure to the 'real world'\" - to complete master's studies in chemistry. Professor of Chemistry Harry Frisch later helped Black- well find a job as a polymer chemist at Bell Laboratories in New Jersey. She worked there for two years before realizing \"I wasn't where I wanted to be\" and going into sales. Shortly afterward, she met Harvard M.B.A. Richard Blackwell; the couple married and had four children within six years. With \"three in diapers at the same time,\" the busy stay-at-home mom promised to \"do something for myself in the future.\" In 1998, Blackwell, by then divorced from her first hus- band and remarried (to George Bailey), kept that promise. Inspired by Americans' focus on health and fitness, she launched Aurora Products Inc., a line of all-natural foods, in a small warehouse in Bridgeport, Conn., with a staff of four and a credit card. T oday, in a bustling 75,000-square-foot facility in Stratford, Conn., more than 150 employees process and package container loads of dried fruit, nuts and other high-quality ingredients shipped in from all over the U.S. and the world. Aurora Products contain no artificial colors, flavorings or preservatives. Only natural sweeteners, such as fruit juice, are used in the preparation of granola, trail mixes and other healthy snacks. The product line can be found at major East Coast supermarket chains (such as Stop & Stop, Big Y, A&P and Hannaford); national warehouse Stephanie (Vogel) Blackwell, M.S.'76 Businesswoman Extraordinaire channels\" as T.J.Maxx, Marshall's, Christmas T ree Shops and Mohegan Sun). About half of Aurora's business consists of privately labeled packaged goods sold under retailers' own brand names. In addition to guaranteeing her customers fresh, wholesome products, Blackwell is working to sus-tain the environment. Much of Aurora's packaging is both manufactured from recycled materials and recyclable. Organic sunflower oil left over from the nut-roasting process \"is sold and re-used as fuel,\" she adds. Blackwell, who prefers that all her employees call her Stephanie, recognizes that people are key to Aurora's success. She gives back to her neigh-bors, supporting such Stratford-area initiatives as Habitat for Humanity and Sterling House, a community center. Some of her employees are hired through The Kennedy Center, a non-profit rehabilitation agency that supports more than 1,500 disabled and mentally challenged adults. Aurora is flourishing: Seasonal employees aid in handling holiday production. A move to an addi-tional 90,000-square-foot plant in nearby Milford is anticipated soon. The company, which ended its inaugural year with gross sales of $900,000, looks forward to finishing 2011 at close to $40 million in sales. Blackwell is gratified at Aurora's growth - and delighted that her children Matthew, Laura and Gregory are working with her now. As director of Operations, national marketing manager and customer service associate, respectively, they are bringing a fresh perspective to the business while learning to carry on their mom's commitment to product quality, her concern for the environment, and her loyalty to those who work for her and live in the surrounding community. Daughter Lindsay, a 2006 UAlbany graduate and Florida resident, is pursuing her own career interests.

Justin's and DeJohn's are restaurants that nearly face each other on Lark Street. Just down the street is Legends on Lark; Pearl Street Pub and the Dirty Martini Lounge are located farther downtown. DeJohn also oper - ates the concessions for The Armory a sports venue. By year's end, several other projects should be up and running, including a nightclub on the lower level of the Armory, and a pub on the Washington Street side of the building. Legends on Pearl and DeJohn's Ship Pub, in Latham, opened this fall. \"I think that managing classes and schoolwork taught me a lot about being able to run 10 restaurants,\" said DeJohn, pausing to chat in the busy, white-tableclothed dining room at Justin's. DeJohn, who majored in English, credits UAlbany, and his two years' active duty in the Marines, with giving him the tools to run his businesses. Many of these tools are social in nature: Don't demonize things you don't understand. If you fight everybody you don't agree with, you'll never get anything done. If you can under - stand what people are thinking, you can get them on your side. DeJohn's first job, at 15, was washing dishes at an inn in the Catskills. He worked in every position - except cook - while he got his associate's degree at Columbia-Greene Community College, and in more restaurants while he attended UAlbany. Following graduation, DeJohn served with the Marines. He was a technician at Verizon for 11 years, continuing to work for the company while running his first two restaurants. \"The biggest thing I learned is how to manage people and how to motivate them to do things they don't necessarily want to do. I learned that leadership from UAlbany, from the interaction between students and teachers,\" he said.

By sophomore year, I'd settled on an English major and an art minor. I still didn't have a career picked out, but I knew I wanted to write.\" T o that end, she took the sole journalism course UAlbany then offered and wrote for the ASP \"now and then.\" Later, \"I went straight from col- lege to graduate school at NYU Journalism, where I rode out the early-'90s reces- sion and earned a master's degree.\" Newman's first media positions ranged from an unpaid intern- ship at New York Magazine to \"some odd part-time, paying gigs - writing book- jacket copy for trashy romance novels, editing crossword puzzles, copy-editing for a financial weekly. My first full-time job was as associate editor for Traders Magazine, and I spent several years in financial journalism.\"In her current career, Newman most enjoys \"the op- portunity to taste such a vast array of spirits and cocktails - and to meet the people behind them, the distillers and bartenders. It still amazes me that I get paid to taste spirits and then write about what I think,\" marvels Newman, who blogs at karanewman.wordpress.com and also discusses wine and spirits regularly on radio and television and at seminars. Newman's first book, Spice & Ice, written while she was a columnist for Chile Pepper magazine, came about when \"I realized I had more great recipes and stories than I could ever shoehorn into the col-umn.\" Currently, the Manhattan resident is working on two others: The Secret Financial Life of Food, \"about agricultural commodities like pork bellies, but from a culinary perspective,\" and a cocktail cookbook for which she and her publisher will develop an app. Newman employs \"a pretty seasonal approach\" to recipe development. \"I'll start with whatever feels right for the season - lighter spirits for spring, for example - and then I'll think about the produce and herbs or spices that are available. After that, it's a matter of adding citrus, sweet-eners, and bitter elements that enhance and balance out the combination. And after that I think about presenta-tion - what kind of ice, glassware, garnishes to use.\" If a recipe doesn't work, \"I tweak it or scrap it. P .S., I usually don't have a shortage of recipe testers for cocktail ideas!\" observes Newman, who shares the following recipe with UAlbany readers.Kara Newman, B.A.'92 A Spirited Writer By Carol Olechowski Kara Newman launched her career by writing about one of her passions: food. \"After a couple of years, I realized that this was not just a hobby, and it began to consume more of my attention.

I use sociology every single day because I deal with people,\" said T olive, whose 60-seat restaurant is a Capital Region fixture. \"We've offered health insurance for 20 years,\" she added. \"We were one of the first restaurants to do that. I recognize that this is not just a business.\" The sense that the restaurant is a people-centered enter - prise, for both workers and customers, perhaps comes from T olive's thinking like a sociologist. Her minor in business administration turned out to be important, too. She uses basic accounting skills daily and marketing routinely. The market research she did door-to- door - including one survey for Cup-A-Soup - added to her understanding of people and business, too. El Loco began as a lunch cart at the Capitol building; after a season, T olive and her business (and romantic) partner looked for an indoor location. Using money she'd saved up to backpack around Europe, they opened the restaurant. \"I said I'd do it for a year,\" she laughed. When the year was up, her mate was gone, but she and the business stayed put. Eventually, she traveled around Europe with her daughters. When she celebrated El Loco's 20th anniversary, former staff came from all over - even Alaska. T olive is happiest \"when I bring people together. Whether it's bringing together people who are eating and having a good time, or whether it's my staff, the restaurant's a nexus, and I think that's my importance in life.\" Marcia Tolive, B.A. '81 Bringing People Together By Amy Halloran, B.A.'90What's Cookin'?

We wanted to have a business of our own, and it was something that we knew, so we find ourselves doing it,\" said Martin. There are four Butera's restaurants, located in Seaford, Woodbury, Sayville and Smithtown, N.Y. Each seats 90-95 people. After graduating from UAlbany with a degree in business, Mar - tin took a job with Federated Department Stores as database administrator. He got his master's in history at SUNY Stony Brook, thinking he wanted to teach, until the restaurant business lured him back. Laurie, who also majored in busi- ness administration, took a job with a precious-metals company following graduation, working \"with commodities and rare coins. I had a lot of customers,\" she recalled. \"It was a great job.\" The market was doing really well, but when the oppor - tunity arose, Laurie decided to open the restaurant with Martin and Gary. As a restaurant owner, Laurie noted, \"you really need to be proficient in accounting, finance, personal communications - pretty much everything.\" \"We all realized there's something to be said about making for yourself and doing your own thing,\" added Martin, who liked - and still likes - cooking. Martin and Gary are executive chefs. They wear whites and work on the line in the kitchens, preparing regional Italian dishes. Laurie manages the front of the house, where she sees lots of friends from UAlbany. They see a lot of alumni elsewhere, too. \"I never knew Albany was so close to the Island,\" quipped Martin. Many of the restaurant staff worked their way through high school, then college, with the Buteras accommodating sched-ules so employees could pri-oritize education. Connections with clientele allowed the couple to introduce staff to employers beyond the world of food. Such connections have served the Butera family well, too. A customer told a colleague at Good Housekeeping that they must have Butera's recipe for chicken meatballs. The recipe was made three times in the magazine's test kitchen, determined good enough to run and featured in the October 2004 issue. What's Cookin'?

Samuelsson is a chef known for his restaurants and cookbooks, and for promoting healthy eating. www.albany.edu 35Mike Tritchonis As a communication major at the University at Albany, Morris found that her minor in theatre helped break her out of her shell, allowing her to take on different roles. \"When you're in the restaurant business, or any business where you're dealing with clients, it helps to know that sometimes there's a persona you have to put on, and that's okay,\" said Morris. A class in mediation and arbitration was another good tool for Morris as her professional life evolved from waiting tables to her current high-profile post, thanks to her insatiable curiosity and a passion for food. While managing the front of the house for a restaurant with an open kitchen, she spent a lot of time surveying the dining room from the kitchen. Morris quizzed the chefs about what they were doing, and one of them suggested she attended the Culinary Institute of America. Once she graduated, she helped launch a res-taurant, then talked her way into doing special events for People magazine. Her lack of maga-zine experience was seen as a potential deficit, but, she told her interviewers: \"I've been running a restaurant where the kitchen could be on fire, and I'm out on the floor, looking at guests and saying, 'Hi; how are you?' Just doing the magic show every night.\" After four years at Time, Inc., Morris took a job in special events with New York Magazine. T wo years later, she directed special events at Gourmet, the definitive food magazine. After the magazine's surprising end, she joined Marcus Samuelsson Group, where she's arranged events that allowed her to meet President Obama and former President Clinton. \"I'm on the other side of it now,\" she said, ex- plaining that the events department was always part of marketing in the media world. \"While working at the magazine, I was constantly creat-ing and creating and executing sponsor opportunities, so there's a lot of crossover in that way. I know what sponsors are looking for. I know the lan-guage and the way things are approached.\" Her career is full of highlights. When the Dem- ocratic National Convention held a fundraising dinner at Red Rooster in March, Morris served President Obama his dinner. T wo months later, she met former President Clinton when the Clinton Foundation held an event there. One of her favorite events, however, was helping a mother prepare her son's graduation party. As \"amazing\" as the big-name events are, Morris noted, \"when you do an event for the everyday person who is so appreciative of everything, you feel really good at the end of the day.\" In the course of her career, Morris has waited tables, run restaurants and planned special events.What's Cookin'?36 UAlbany Magazine Fall 2011Great Danes defensive end Eddie Delaneywww.albany.edu 37 Might as well let the offensive line know. See if they can stop him. Good luck. They haven't thus far. \"One hand or two hands, it comes down to whether you can play,\" Delaney said. Since joining the UAlbany football program in 2007, Delaney's contributions have been steady and sig- nificant. As a freshman, he caught the attention of his coaches and teammates with his passion and perfor - mance on the scout team. Practices were his games, and his intensity was contagious. The following year, Delaney became a starter at left defensive end and made the All-Northeast Conference second team. Last season, he made the conference's first team after recording 41 tackles, includ- ing 4.5 for a loss. \"He has great quickness, tremendous strength, and an intense desire to excel,\" Ford said. \"Those things are more im- portant than playing with two hands.\" Delaney finished his undergraduate work last spring but has one season of eligibility left because he redshirted his freshman season. This year, he will take graduate courses in communications. He has had to overcome more than just playing with one hand. He's also a dia-betic who wears an insulin pump. At the start of his col-lege career, Delaney would often need to take a break to correct his blood-sugar levels, but he and medical staff have kept the situation under control. Delaney's close monitoring of his body has also helped him reshape it. When he arrived at UAlbany, he was just over 210 pounds. He expects to play his senior season at 250, the result of intense weight lifting. Delaney bench- presses 360 pounds by balancing half the weight against his arm. \"Watching him lift is quite a sight,\" Ford said. \"It is truly unbelievable.\" While he would like to play football as long as he can, mentioning a possible post-college ca- reer in Canada or the United Football League as possibilities, Delaney said he also is considering trying to build a career that combines his communica- tions degree and his expert workout- room knowledge into helping design equipment for people with disabilities. \"I'd love to share what I've learned, and some of my methods, with people throughout the world,\" Delaney said. They would hear that message from a person who has a history of success and inspiration.THE UNSTOPPABLE Eddie Delaney BY JEFF GOLD If Great Danes defensive end Eddie Delaney has a long-sleeved shirt in his locker, University at Albany Head Coach Bob Ford hasn't seen him put it on. All long sleeves would do is disguise the truth: Delaney was born without a left hand.UAlbany AthleticsAsk Geoff By Geoff Williams , University Archivist For me, until very recently, much of the art has been backdrop. I have given guided tours for alumni classes and outside groups of the historical art on the downtown campus for many years, and I thought it might be inter - esting to let a wider audience know about the downtown art - and to take a closer look at it myself. In researching this article, I came to realize that the art collections there are much more varied than I thought they were. There are two types of art representing two different periods of the University's history. The first, cre - ated from 1910 through the 1940s, is very traditional and celebrates classical, historical or literary themes. All of the early 20th-century art was purchased with funds from alumni or graduating classes, and most of it has been restored by alumni. The second, 81 items in all - far more than I had imagined - is art from the University's contemporary art collections, most installed during the last 10 years and representing student art works, and/or art given to or loaned to the University. These pieces repre - sent a conscious effort by the Univer - sity Art Museum to display works that would ordinarily be stored. Our earliest collections of art date from the construction of the Willett Street building in the 1880s. A prominent feature of that building was a massive stained-glass window depicting classical Greek and Roman themes related to education, and reputed to be the largest such window in the United States at the time. Located in the Assembly Hall of the State Normal School, which became the State Normal College in 1890, the window was paid for by the Alumni Association, designed by Ezra T readwell of Boston, and possibly completed by Tiffany & Co. Unfortunately, no color image of it exists. When the Willett Street build - ing burned in 1906, the Alumni Win - dow was completely destroyed, along with oil paintings of the school's early leaders. The only item saved from the fire was the plaster statue of Minerva, the Roman goddess of wisdom and UAlbany's symbol. (For more about Minerva, please see \"Ask Geoff\" in the Fall 2007 UAlbany, which is available online.) Graduating classes soon decided that a stained-glass window for the new audi - torium - the first floor of what is now Hawley Hall, or the Dewey Library - would be an ideal gift to the school. From 1910 through 1926, graduat - ing classes and student groups from the State Normal College, and after 1914, the New York State College for T eachers, donated funds to install in the auditorium stained-glass windows portraying classical Greek or Roman themes, and occasionally historical themes tied to the immediate past. The latter included the Class of 1920 gift, a window depicting the World War I cemetery at Flanders Field in Belgium, and the 1926 Spanish Club's gift memorializing Francesca Martinez, a beloved French and Spanish teacher who died in 1925. Between 1980 and The classical stained-glass window at right was lost in 1906 when the Willett Street building burned. The building is pictured above after the fire. Have you ever looked closely at the walls of UAlbany's downtown campus? Or are they just backdrops for studying or for moving from one room or building to another? 38 UAlbany Magazine Fall 20111986, the Hawley windows were restored by the Chapman Studio in Albany, which is credited with designing many of the windows originally. The classes of 1927, 1928, 1929, 1930, 1931, 1932, 1933, 1934 and 1952 paid for the restorations. Not to be outdone by State College for T eachers classes, Milne High School stu - dents embarked on their own campaign to beautify Milne Hall, which opened in1929. They raised funds to reproduce the 115-foot-long by 11-inch-high frieze of \"Alexander the Great's Entrance into Babylon\" around the top of the library in Milne 200. The frieze was copied from the one created for the Quirinal Palace in Rome by the Danish sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen and com - missioned by Napoleon in 1815 to celebrate his conquest of Italy. Milne students also deco - rated the walls of their library with the first murals on the downtown campus. During the early 1930s and '40s, at the suggestion of Milne School Principal John Sayles, the students commissioned Albany artist David Lithgow to create murals represent - ing the Leather Stocking T ales and the histories of Albany and the State Col - lege for T eachers. Others depict Albany as a trading post, the Anti-Rent riots of 1838, the Anti-Ratification riots of 1788, Governor Dongan signing the Albany Charter, the courtship of Alexander Hamilton and Elizabeth Schuyler, and the state office building near the Capitol, to name a few. The Lithgow series was incomplete, however; the planned mural of the Albany skyline on the north wall was never painted. All of the Milne 200 murals have just been restored by Milne alumni. These and other images of the murals and friezes can be seen online. An even larger set of murals graces Hawley Hall. In 1932, then-Gov. Franklin Roosevelt approved funds to transform the Hawley auditorium into a library for the State College for T eachers. Later, as president during the Depression, Roosevelt supported hiring artists with federal funds to create art in public spaces - and, for the first time, art on the downtown campus was not paid for by students or graduates. In the next \"Ask Geoff,\" I'll continue our look at the downtown campus as art gallery and provide an itinerary for a self-guided tour. In this 1940 shot of Hawley Library, several murals are partially visible. A stained-glass representation of Flanders Field, far right, is also displayed there. Milne School students raised funds for a frieze depicting \"Alexander the Great's Entrance into Babylon,\" top, and a mural portraying the arrival of Henry Hudson's Half Moon in Albany, bottom. www.albany.edu 39Gary Gold '70Judy Madnick '65, '6634 Dorothy Griffin celebrated her 97th birthday in July in good health, although she is very lame.

It was a treasured evening; the former classmates shared unusual historical tidbits about Firenze (Florence), fine food and wine at a special \"local\" restaurant, and gelato for dessert. Unfortunately, Harold's wife recently passed away. A memorial Mass for her in the village outside Florence where she spent her childhood drew about a hundred dear friends from Quarrata, Pistoia and Firenze.

It can provide you an assured lifetime income and, importantly, the proceeds can eventually provide a scholarship to a worthy student.

Here's how it works: 1) Y ou make a contribution to The University at Albany Foundation and receive a fixed income for one or two lives, with payments partially tax-free; 2) Y ou receive a charitable tax deduction for a portion of the gift; 3) Y ou direct how the proceeds will eventually be used - for a scholarship, award or other educational purpose.

Thanksgiving week, they went with their family on a cruise on the Rhine from Basel, Switzerland, to Amsterdam, The Volunteering on the Rise at UAlbany Volunteering is an important component of the UAlbany student culture. It's a tradition that doesn't end at graduation, though. From class-reunion planning, to mentoring students, to providing career assistance, thousands of alumni volunteers play a key role in the University's day-to-day life. Brian Fessler '06, '07 is chair of GOLD (Graduates of the Last Decade), which provides services specifically for recent grads, and is a member of the Alumni Association board. Fessler says volunteering has enabled him to make many new personal and professional connections while helping other alums stay connected with one another and their alma mater. He's committed to ensuring that current students have as productive an experience at UAlbany as he did. Michael Borys '78, '79, a vice president with Goldman Sachs, enjoys sharing his industry knowledge and experiences with students, helping them through the transition from college to the workforce. Borys says he enjoys keeping up with the progress at the University, as well as meeting and mentoring new students. Like Borys, Jane Hutchins '56 is a committed volunteer, although her focus is more on reunion planning. She finds that volunteering provides her with the rewarding feeling of having assisted someone, or a group, in a positive way. Brian Straughter, vice president for T urf Hotels, is a member of the UAlbany Foundation board. This past year, Straughter and his colleagues helped incoming freshmen move into their dorms. Having benefited from the participation of volunteer coaches as a child, he says it feels good to be on the other side of the equation now - giving back and being part of the important work the University does for the community. Volunteer opportunities with UAlbany can be local, regional - even virtual.

Carol Mardigan Carlson is a retired school Ever since he was \"old enough to pick up a pair of binoculars and scan the lake,\" Whitehall, N.Y., native Robert Bartholomew has been interested in \"Champ,\" the Lake Champlain monster. Early next year, with the publication of The Untold Story of Champ: An Unauthorized Biography of America's Loch Ness Monster (SUNY Press), which he describes as \"both a history and an expos\u00e9,\" Bartholomew will \"present the Champlain Monster like people have never seen him before.\" Bartholomew himself has never seen Champ, \"or 'Champy,' depending on where you live.\" However, \"I learned that there is a great deal of misinformation about Champ. The book separates fact from speculation. Also, virtually none of the 19th-century history of Champ has ever been published before. I believe that local residents deserve to know the full story.\" Bartholomew promises \"many surprises. It is a 'warts-and-all' biography that takes journalists to task for sloppy reporting over the years and examines the antics of modern-day Champ hunters: their egos, obsessions and behind-the-scenes squabbles. Also examined is whether the famous Mansi photo is a hoax.\" For The Untold Story of Champ, Bartholomew interviewed several people, including a retired SUNY Plattsburgh communications professor, Philip Reines, who began researching the monster in the mid-1960s. The book includes a preface by UAlba - ny journalism adjunct professor Ronald Kermani, \"a brilliant writer and a legend in Albany for his penetrating investigative reporting for the Times Union. He also had a sighting of Champ,\" notes Bartholomew, who earned a master's in sociology from UAlbany and recalls the University as \"an important part of my life.\" So, what is Champ? \"Local icon, environmental symbol, tourist draw, and per - haps a new or long-extinct species,\" muses Bartholomew, now a history teacher at Botany Downs Secondary College in South Auckland, New Zealand. \"Ultimately, the history of Champ reveals more about us than it does about him.\" Another book by Bartholomew, The Martians Have Landed! A History of Media- Driven Panics and Hoaxes (co-authored with Benjamin Radford), will be released by McFarland Publishing in October. - By Carol Olechowski Robert Bartholomew, M.A.'84 Champ's BiographerJamilah Bartholomewwww.albany.edu 49Alumni News & Notes superintendent.

The book documents the impact of these environmental changes on the region's bird population and discusses the recovery of the endangered Bald Eagle and the new confirmation of breeding by three species - the Common Merganser, the Ruddy Duck and the Double-crested Cormorant. www.albany.edu 5758 UAlbany Magazine Fall 2011Alumni News & Notes Deaths 1930s Dorothy James Olson '31, Dec. 27, 2009 Dorothy Gray Blizzard '32, April 11, 2011 Virginia Abajian Chalison '34, Feb. 6, 2006 Evelyn Anderson Darrow '35, June 24, 2005 Edith Estabrooks Wilson '35, Dec. 8, 2008 Ruth Duffy Logan '36, Aug. 20, 2010Evelyn O'Brien Rose '36, May 1, 2011Eunice Brooks '37, Nov. 13, 2010 Bertha Bond Emerson '38, Dec. 28, 2010 Eleanor Jones Clapp '39, May 4, 2011 Catharine Molony Fogarty '39, July 26, 2008 Clara 2, 2011 Mary Margaret Pappa Schwerzmann July 27, 2010 1940s Robert P .

Brophy, Jr. '49, Feb. 19, 2011 Vincent O'Leary, who served as the University at Albany's 15th president, passed away April 22, 2011, in Maryland. He was 86. A California native educated at San Francisco State College and the University of Washington, O'Leary was widely respected for his expertise in probation and parole. His career included service as as - sistant director of the National Crime Commission under President Lyndon Johnson; director of Research and Policy for the National Council on Crime and Delinquency; director of parole supervision for the State of T exas; and chief probation and parole officer for the State of Washington. O'Leary joined the University at Albany's School of Criminal Justice in 1968, later serving as dean. He became president of the University in 1977 and, for the next 13 years, oversaw remark- able growth in both programs and facilities. Ph.D. programs restored and created through the Nelson A. Rockefeller College of Public Affairs and Policy attained national recognition. The Univer - sity's School of Public Health, which observed its 25th anniversary this year, was founded in partnership with David Axelrod, M.D., then New York State's health commissioner. Under O'Leary's leadership, the University launched its first international exchange efforts; ex - panded student housing; planned for the construction of the athletics facility now known as SEFCU Arena and of the Science Library, both located on the uptown campus; and significantly increased the amount of external research funding its programs attracted. O'Leary advanced the University in other ways, as well, particularly with regard to improving diversity. Programs set in place to promote understanding and ease tensions also attracted more people of color to the ranks of faculty, students and staff. In The Improbable President, his 2004 memoir, O'Leary recounted his years at the helm of the University at Albany. After completing his tenure as president in 1990, O'Leary returned to the School of Criminal Justice faculty. He taught there until retiring to California with his wife, Lihua Yu O'Leary. O'Leary is survived by his wife; daughters Beth O'Leary and Cathy Goldwyn; stepchildren Lena, Eugene and Anna Sun; and 10 grandchildren. The family requests that gifts in Vin- cent O'Leary's name be made to the University he loved so much. Checks payable to The University at Albany Foundation may be directed to The Foundation's office at: Univer - sity at Albany, 1400 Washington Ave., UAB 226, Albany, NY 12222. A memorial service for former President O'Leary will be held at 10:30 a.m. Sunday, Oct. 16, in the SEFCU Arena's Hall of Fame Room.
