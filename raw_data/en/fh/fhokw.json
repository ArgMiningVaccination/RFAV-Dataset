From here, we will begin to lay a foundation for your wellness journey by developing an integrated herbal, nutritional, and lifestyle protocol to support you in addressing your wellness goals. After our initial intake consultation, you will receive written guidance via email within one week of our meeting that will include any lifestyle, herbal, nutritional, and dietary recommendations discussed. This protocol will include a custom herbal formula and/or tea blend I have prepared for you. Ongoing Support Appointments are 45 minute sessions offered 4-6 weeks after the initial intake consultation and throughout the course of a package to see how the herbs are working with you, to answer any questions, and to make any adjustments to your initial recommendation. Beyond our first ongoing support appointment, these sessions allow us to check in on your progress, discuss any questions you may have, and explore new concerns and needs your body expresses as you journey through our work together and as the seasons shift. Written Guidance / Herbal Protocols may include custom herbal tea blends, tinctures, and other preparations. This guidance may also include lifestyle changes, recipes, foods, movement, body work, meditation or reflection practices, and suggestions for how to integrate all practices and herbs into your routine. For each session, I devote roughly 3-5 hours to research related to everything discussed in our session to chose herbs and deliver suggestions that will best support you in your wellness journey. I charge $125 for Initial Intake Consultations (90 minutes), and $75 for Ongoing Support Appointments (45 minutes). For most clients, I tend to recommend one or more sessions beyond our Initial Intake Consultation to deliver the most comprehensive herbal care possible. Toward this end, I offer consultation packages with discounted pricing for purchasing multiple appoinments at once. For all new clients, start by booking an Initial Intake Consultation (below) and we will discuss the appropriate package for you at our first session.
