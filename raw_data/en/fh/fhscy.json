OCTOBER Children who require 2 doses should receive their first dose as soon as possible after vaccine becomes available to allow the second dose to be received by the end of October. For those requiring 1 dose, early vaccination (i.e., in July and August) is likely to be associated with suboptimal immunity before the end of the influenza season, particularly among older adults.

Mr. Jordan received his BBA from the Goizueta Business School at Emory University and his master's degree in journalism from the Grady College of Journalism at UGA. During the 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic, he served in CDC's Emergency Operations Center (EOC), where he helped draft, review and clear agency communications products, messages and guidance documents. He has years of experience as a project manager merging new technologies and art with public health education. During the 2009 pandemic, Mr. Jordan spearheaded the agency's use of YouTube as a platform for creating educational videos featuring CDC subject matter experts. One video was shown on the Daily Show with Jon Stewart. Mr. Jordan's influenza -related images and illustrations have been used in books, medical exhibits, museums and journal articles around the world. In 2018, he wrote and managed the creation of a graphic novel called the Junior Disease Detectives: Operation Outbreak, which educates youth about variant flu, careers in public and animal health, zoonotic and pandemic disease threats, and the real -life way CDC investigates disease outbreaks. The graphic novel was covered by CNN, Fortune, the Verge and the Atlanta Journal Constitution, among other outlets. Mr. Jordan continues to work on innovative projects that merge art and health education at CDC.

Children aged 6 months through 8 years who require 2 doses (see Children Aged 6 Months Through 8 Years) should receive their first dose as soon as possible after the vaccine becomes available to allow the second dose (which must be administered 4 weeks later) to be received by the end of October. For those requiring only 1 dose for the season, early vaccination (i.e., in July and August) is likely to be associated with suboptimal immunity before the end of the influenza season, particularly among older adults. Although vaccination by the end of October is recommended, vaccine administered in December or later, even if influenza activity has already begun, might be beneficial in the majority of influenza seasons.\" July-August: \"It might be too soon to get vaccinated, particularly if you are an adult 65 years of age or older. For a child needing two doses of vaccine, July -August administration of the first dose is ok. CDC recommends flu vaccination by the end of October. \" Beginning in September: \"CDC recommends flu vaccination by the end of October. While it's fine to get vaccinated in September, keep four things in mind: 1. Current flu levels are (low/rising/high); 2. It takes about two weeks after vaccination for protective antibodies to develop; 3. Immunity from vaccination wanes over time; and, 4. Flu activity most often peaks in February and can last as late as May. October \"Get vaccinated by the end of October.\" Beginning in November: \"CDC recommends vaccination continue as long a influenza viruses are circulating. Though the timing of flu season varies, significant flu activity can last as late as May.\" Vaccine Timing Messaging Throughout Flu Season Early December through February: (somewhat dependent on activity) \"It's not too late to get vaccinated. CDC recommends vaccination continue as long as influenza viruses are circulating. Though the timing of flu season varies, flu season most often peaks in December and February, but significant flu activity can last as late as May.\" March -May: Flu viruses are circulating at X levels nationally though activity varies by location. CDC recommends vaccination continue as long as influenza viruses are circulating. Check FluView Interactive for more information about flu activity in your state. Starting in June: \"Most flu vaccine expires by the end of June. If you haven't gotten vaccinated and plan a trip to the Southern Hemisphere, where their flu season is just beginning, or plan to travel in a relatively crowded setting where people from many parts of the country might be in close proximity, e.g., a cruise, get a flu vaccine at least two weeks before traveling.

Community vaccination programs should balance maximizing likelihood of persistence of vaccine - induced protection through the season with avoiding missed opportunities to vaccinate or vaccinating after onset of influenza circulation occurs. Efforts should be structured to optimize vaccination coverage before influenza activity in the community begins. Providers should offer influenza vaccine routinely, and organized vaccination campaigns should continue throughout the influenza season, including after influenza activity has begun in the community. Vaccine administered in December or later, even if influenza activity has already begun, might be beneficial in the majority of influenza seasons.https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/rr/rr6803a1.htm?s_cid=rr6803a1_w 2010 -20 Influenza Season MMWR -Aug 2019 American Pharmacists Association JAN DEC February Begin planning season plan based on CDC rec and other inputVaccine ordering (Jan -May) Offering vaccination (Aug -Apr/May) ordering (Feb -May) MMWR -Aug 2019Need clarity, consistency and understanding in regard to timing for vaccine administration Communication between members of immunization neighborhood Need to avoid finger pointing...
