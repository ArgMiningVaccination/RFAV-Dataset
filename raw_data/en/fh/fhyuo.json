Using these chemical-based cleaners can lead to long-term health issues, and the manufacturing and disposal of these products pollute the environment. Despite the consequences of [exposure to indoor air pollutants](https://www.bluepointenvironmental.com/indoor-air-quality-health-effects/), the U.S. government doesn't assess the safety of cleaning products or require manufacturers to list ingredients on their labels. This means that consumers are somewhat in the dark when it comes to choosing safe cleaning items. Thankfully, chemical-laden products aren't the only means to keep a home clean. Rather than purchasing costly, toxic cleaners, try making your own natural, non-toxic versions using ingredients that you likely already have in your kitchen. Making your own homemade cleaning solutions is better for your health, protects the environment, and is a great way to save money. What's in Your Cleaning Products? Warning! Toxic! Flammable! With labels like these it's clear that the use of conventional cleaning products is potentially damaging to our overall health and wellbeing at home. Below are some of the most harmful chemicals currently used in household cleaners. Dioxane This ingredient is a carcinogen found in many common laundry and dish detergents. Quaternary Ammonium Compounds Also known as Quats, this chemical is known to trigger asthma and is often found in spray cleaners and fabric softeners. Chlorine Bleach Bleach fumes can contain chlorine and chloroform, which have been connected to respiratory and neurological effects and cancer when inhaled. Fragrance The familiar ingredient known simply as \"fragrance\" may contain hundreds of different chemical compounds, including phthalates, an endocrine disruptor. Fragrances are known to trigger asthma, allergies, and other respiratory irritations. Diethylene Glycol Monomethyl Ether This ingredient is a solvent used in some degreasers and heavy-duty cleaners. This compound is actually banned for use in cleaners in the EU, as it's been linked to reproductive health effects. Luckily, none of these ingredients are necessary for keeping your home clean and sanitized. It's easy to make your own safe, non-toxic cleaning products using the natural ingredients listed below.
