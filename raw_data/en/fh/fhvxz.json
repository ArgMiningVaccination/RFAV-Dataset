According to a 2016 Mintel study, 86% of all British adults have suffered some form of gastrointestinal problem or ailment. We know that gut health is crucial all year round, but our digestive systems may need extra TLC over the winter to help combat the effects of festive season! Homeopathy is the best way to address the underlying problems of gut health, tackling day-to-day symptoms effectively and naturally. Whether your gut health is a recent issue or a chronic problem, a professional homeopath will be able to select the right homeopathic medicine for you. Homeopathic remedies can be effective at treating a range of issues, including stomach cramps, diarrhea, digestive problems and other disorders. Top 5 Homeopathic treatments for gut health Nux Vom This homeopathic remedy relieves nausea and cramps from indigestion, especially after excessive eating of rich foods or drinking of alcohol. There can be an (ineffectual) urge to pass a stool. Nux Vom helps with overindulgence, constipation and heartburn. Ars Alb This homeopathic medicine may be indicated if a person feels anxious, restless yet exhausted and feels worse from the smell and sight of food. Burning pain is felt in the stomach and oesophagus, which often feels better for warmth and sitting up. There can be nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. Drinking little sips of water can help reduce symptoms. Carbo Veg This homeopathic remedy helps relieve bloating and gas in the stomach, particularly when there is belching. For those who struggle with rich, fatty foods, Carbo Veg works to combat pain, heaviness and fullness in the stomach. Lycopodium This homeopathic medicine relieves discomfort and indigestion, with bloating around the waist and gas, especially after eating onions or garlic. Lycopodium helps to reduce uncomfortable and painful bloating in the lower stomach. Nat Carb This homeopathic remedy can be helpful to people who have trouble digesting and assimilating many foods and have to stay on restricted diets. Indigestion, heartburn and ulcers can occur if offending foods are eaten. Milk or dairy products can lead to flatulence or sputtery diarrhea that leaves an empty feeling in the stomach. Cravings for potatoes and sweets are common, as well as milk even though it makes these people sick, so they have learned to avoid it. Lifestyle changes Lifestyle changes and dietary modifications can also help your gut health. You may have already tried probiotics, upping your intake of fermented foods, such as live yogurt, kimchi, sauerkraut or kombucha, trying different diets such as plant based or keto, or exercise such as yoga. All of these can help to support a healthy gut. About Kiran Kiran Grover MA, LCHE, RSHom qualified from the Centre for Homeopathic Education (CHE) in 2007.
