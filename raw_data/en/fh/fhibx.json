Amici have a strong interest in the development of administrative and co pyright law in a manner that ena- bles simple an d unive rsal acce ss charge to re gu- lator y law. Amici agree with respondents that this C ourt should uphol d the El eventh Circuit ruling that the gov- ernment edicts exception to copyrightability e xtends to the entire Official Code of Georgia Annota ted. A s schol- ars o f federa l incorporation by referenc e of private standards , amici write separately to urge the Cour t to reaffirm the application of the government edicts do c- trine to all text that a government has adopted as the law. In particular, the governmen t edicts doc trine ap plies to all federa l regula tory text with the force of law, includ- ing lan guage that federa l agenci es have adopted from private drafters through incorporation by reference . SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT Federal regulatory law contains thousands o f \"incor- pora tions by reference\" of othe r materi als. Agencies have incorporated legal text ori ginally drafted b y private organizations ranging from the standards -focused Amer- ican Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) to indus- trial trade associ ations such as the Amer ican Pet roleum Institute (API). Recent examples i nclude rules address- ing food add itives, envir onme ntal safeguards for oil wells and pipelines, and child and infant product safety. Under current practices, pr ivately drafted materials are incor- porated only by re ference. T heir text doe s not ap pear in the Federal Register , the Code of Fede ral Reg ulatio ns, or the agency's website, although the incorporated mate- rial has the same force of law as regulat ory text appear- ing directly in th ose publications . 3 ASTM and other priva te stand ards draf ting o rgani- zations argue in amicus briefs submitted in this case that the Court should jettison the government edicts doctrine for incorporated -by-reference material because copy- right protection is needed for private standards devel- opment. Those amicus bri efs do n ot tell the whole story. Because the text of incorporated -by-reference m ate- rial does not appear in the Code of Federal Regul ations in the Federal Register, or on government websites, regulated entities and members of the public alike face substant ial cha llenge in acces sing the law. Standards made part of regulations through incorp oration by refe r- ence are difficult to find and expensive to read. Pieces of binding federal regulations are now scattered across numerous private, difficult -to-navigate we bsites ma n- aged by the standards develop ment organizations under claims of copyright. The private orga nizations reserve the right to choose the fee that must be paid to read the standards. A single standard can cost several hundred dollars. The priv ate orga nizations have also el iminated access t o some standards alt ogether. These barriers su b- stantially imped e regula ted entities and the public at large from knowing the law, with destructive conse- quences for fair notice and the public's ability to ci- pate i n core gover nment proc esses. quest ion whether standards drafting rgan iza- tions c an maintain a cop yright in particular text once it has been incorporated into the substance of federal law, enabling them to demand payment for access to the text or elimi nate such acce ss altog ether, is at issu e in pending litigation in the D istrict Court for the District of Colum- bia between Pu blic.Resource.Org, respondent here, and several pr ivate organizations. We agree with amicus ASTM that those issues should no t be add ressed by the 4 Court in this cas e, but r ather should be resolved in liti ga- tion directl y addressing them . At the same time, we urge the Court, as it r esolves whether the government edicts doctrine a pplies to the entire Official Code of Georgia Annot ated, to reject the implicatio ns of the Solicit or General's brief that a gov- ernment official must pen a standa rd for that standard to be a government edict. Instead, government adoption is the critical feature. A go vernment -adopted standard with the force of law is a government edict to which p ublic a c- cess is of v ital importance , whether that s tandard in- cludes only text penned by the government or also text incorporated by reference . Permitting private organiza- tions to a ssert co pyright over text with the fo rce of l aw threa tens that critical publ ic acces s. Amici do not dispute that pri vate standards can possess genuine value and be of public benefit, but a copyright -based regime is not the only means of rewarding private standards drafte rs when the government adopts text into binding federal regul ations. If th e Court reaches the issue, it should rea ffirm the application of the government edicts doctrine to all regu- lator y text with the force of law, no matter where it is located an d irres pective of whether a p rivate i ndividual has had a hand in dra fting it . ARGUMENT The current regime o f incorporated -by-reference le- gal text smacks of Erwin Griswold 's 1930s -era descri p- tion of At that time , thou sands of pages of new regulations , fres hly issued by New Deal agencies, were obscurely publis hed in \"separate p aper pamphlets\" or even on a \"single sheet of paper .\" Erwin Gr iswold, Gov- ernment in Ignorance of the Law \u2014A Plea for Better 5 Public ation of Executi ve Legis lation , 48 Harv. L . Rev. 198, 2 94 (1934); see Louis L. Jaffe , Judicial Control of Administrative Action 61 (1965) (some portions were \"here and there in t he desk drawers of NRA officials\"). These laws include d hundreds of \"industry\" codes draft- ed u nder the auspices of the Natio nal I ndustrial Recov- ery Act. See Mila Sohoni, Notice and the Ne w Deal , 62 Duke L.J. 1 169, 1179 (2013). The state of affairs resulted in an embarras sing co lloquy in Panama Refining Co. v. Ryan, 293 U.S. 388 (1935), when the \"go vernment attor- ney had to admit dur ing o ral argument that the [Petrol e- um Code] r egulation bein g challenged had been r evoked by the time the lawsuit [to enforce it] was filed\" \u2014a fact of whic h no one, including the governme nt attorneys, had been aware. Mary W hisner, A Manual \"To Inform Eve- ry Citiz en,\" 99 Law Lib r. J. 159, 160 (2007). In response, Congress passed the Federal Re gister Act , requiring the public prin ting a nd distribution of any fed eral agency \"regul ation, rule ... , or simi- lar instrument,\" along with other do cume nts. Pub. L. 74 - 220, 49 Stat. 500 , \u00a7\u00a7 3 -4 (1935 ); see 44 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1501 , et seq. Now, eight ce of fe deral agen ivate control of signif- icant portion s of agency reg ulations has turned the clock sharply back. For thousands of fe deral regulati ons with the force of law, chunks of fe deral regulatory text that were incorpo rated only by refe renc e are scattered across the I nternet and have even disappeared ou tright. Even worse, once the text is located, the private entities in con- trol of it may dema nd that the reader agree to burden- some cond itions or pay to gain acces s to it. 6 I. Without p ublic a cces s, incorporation by referenc e of private standards into the law undermines im- portant public intere sts. When this Court held in 1834 that judicial opi nions cannot be copyrighted, it d eclared: \"Whether le gislative acts, or judi cial con structions or decr ees, knowledge of them is essent ial to the safety of all. ... [T]he la w cannot and ou ght not to be made the prisoner ... of any individ- ual.\" Wheaton v. Peters , 33 U .S. 591, 620 -22 (1834). These principles apply no less to the text of federal regu- lations , regar dless of whether its terms are s tated direct- ly or embodied in an ind ustrial standar d referenced in a regulation, and regardless of who initially participated in its drafting.2 A. Copyrig ht-facilitated private control over federal regulat ory text im pairs p ublic ac- cess to the law. 1. Fede ral agencies currently draw upon sta ndards drafted by private organiza tions and incorp pri- vate standards tandards - focused me mbershi p organiz ations, such as the Ame rican National Standards I nstitute (ANSI) and ASTM , as well as industr ial trade associ ations such as API and the American Herb al Products Association. These organiza- tions draft voluntary s tandard s for a var iety of purposes that may or may not coincide with congressional goals embodied in reg ulato ry statute s. But language that agencies draw from th ese private standards defines the 2 As the Solicitor General's brief acknowledges (at 20 n.3) , au- thorized executive agency wo rks may be treated similarly to statu tes for purposes of copyright law, including the gover nmen t edicts doc- trine. 7 law in numerous a reas, including the substance of legal oblig ations to protect public health, safety , and the envi- ronment in connection with pipeline spills and expl osion s, nuclear power plant operation, and a wide variety of con- sumer products. E.g., 49 C .F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 195.3(b)(17) , ation hazardous liquids , requiring co mpliance with API Standard 620 (2008 ed ition, including three later addenda pipeline fracture control , requiring compliance with A PI Spec 5L (2013 edition) or Amer ican Society for Mechani- cal Eng ineers (ASME) (h)(2), (h)(3) (nuclear power re by ref- erence IEEE Standard 603 -1991 and \"the ; 10 C.F.R. \u00a7 50 .34 (f)(3)(v)(A)(1) (incorpora ting portions of 1980 edition of ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code S ection III Di- vision 2) ; 16 C.F.R. \u00a7 1234.2 (incorporating AS TM F2670-18 on infant bath tubs ). Agencies may incorporate an e ntire private standard, a select ed portion, or a portion of text that the agency then amends to suit its purposes. E.g., 46 C.F.R. \u00a7 53.01- 3 (\"[Mar ine h]eating uct- ed, i nspe cted ... in accordance with section IV of the ASME Bo iler and Pressure Vessel Code (i ncorporated by reference ; see 46 CFR 53.01 -1) as limited, modifi ed, or replaced by speci fic requirement s in this pa rt.\"). Once incorp orated by agencies into duly -promulg ated federal rules, this privately -drafted text indispu tably has the same effect as if it were drafted initially by government officials and printed di rectly into the Code of Federal Regulat ions. Cf. ASTM Amicus Br. at 11 (\"Rather than creating a new set o f rules ... legislatures and agencies 8 can r efer to an alr eady existing standard ... when draft- ing statutes and regulations.\"). ASTM's analogy to a schoo l requiring students to learn a song ly ric, ASTM Amic us Br. at 24 , is far afield . Rather, at issue her e are standa rds that, once adopted by federal regulators, ha ve the full force of law b ehind them. Statutory enforcement provisions, inclu ding those authorizing civil and criminal sanctions and injun ctive relief, extend to all duly promulgated regulations w ithou t excep tion for incorporated mat erial. E.g., 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 60120 (prescribing sanctions U.S.C. \u00a7 3318 (pr escribing p enal- ties for vi olations of r egulation s, including regulations issued un der 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 3306 with respect to marine boilers). Conserv more than twenty -five private o rgan- izations have supplied text that is incorporat ed into the Code of Fede ral Regulations only by refe rence. Seven different private standards organizati ons have each sup- plied incorporated -by-reference material for hundreds of federal regulations. See Emily Schleicher Bremer, In- corporation by Re ference in Federal Regulations , Re- port to the Administrative Con ference of the United States, at 9 (Oct. 19, 201 1), https://www.acus. gov/ report/incorporation -refere nce-report . Moreover, text that has been incor porated by reference itself often in- corporates by reference and requires compl iance with still other private s tandards. 2. Although incorporated -by-referen ce text has the same legal effect as any regu latory te xt, it cannot be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, the Federal Register, on government websites, or in the governmen t depository library system. Rather, when text from pri- vate standards develope rs is incorporated by reference 9 into federal rules , all that appears within t he federal rule is a numeric reference to the standard and the name of the organization. The agency i nstead allow s the incorpo- rated text to be left under the control o f the privat e drafting orga nization via organizational co pyright claims.3 Incorporated -by-reference regulatory text is often extraordinarily difficult to locate. Contrary to amicus ASTM's a ssertion, there is neither widespread nor ready access to these standards. Take the Consumer Prod uct Safety Commission's to y saf ety regulation, 16 C.F.R. \u00a7 1250.2. other provisions , that regulation incor- porates ASTM F963 -17, but only by reference. That standard includes multiple policy judgments aimed at safety, including a 65 -decibel limit on s ound -producing toys used c lose to t he ear, and requirement s regarding toy flammabi lity, toxic ingredients, and sharpness. The 3 Office of Mana gement and Budget (OMB) Circular A -119 i n- structs agencies that incorp orate by reference copyrighted material to \"work with the relevant standards developer to prom ote the availability of the materials ... whil e respect ing the c opyright own- er's interest in pr , Fed- eral Particip ation i n the Development and Use of Voluntary Consen- sus Standard s and in Conformity Assessment Activi ties, Circular A - 119, at 21 (Jan. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(1) requires publication of all agency rules in the Federal Register, but allows incorporation by refe rence of material that is \"reasonably , id. \u00a7 552(a)(1)(E). Alth ough the incorporation is subject to Office of the Federal Register approval , that Office exercises no oversight ov er the material's availability . See 1 C.F.R. \u00a7 51.5(a). While the issue is beyond the scope of this cas e, in corpor ation by referen ce of materials with substantial i mpediments to public ac cess, such as standards described in this brief , likely violates 5 U. S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(1)E) . 10 text of the standard, which now has the full force of law, can be accessed only by searching through ASTM's web- site, where it is f or sale at a price of $89. Both the search and the price a re daun ting obstacles for a parent or small toy maker subject to multiple federal rules. The standard itself incorporates more than fi fteen additional ASTM standards, one of which is noted as wit hdrawn, and sev- eral others th at would require further pu rchas e. For ex- ample , the 2011 version of ASTM F1313, \"Specification for Volatile -Nitrosamine Le vels Nipples on Pacifiers \" (which sets tole rance levels for this known an- imal carcinogen and whi ch is one element of the f ederal- ly-required ASTM F963 -17) costs $ 50.4 The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Admin- istration (PHMSA) safety regulations ai med at control- 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 192.112(b)(1)(ii) , re- quire complia nce with for Mec hanic al Engineers (ASME) standard B31 .8 (2007 edition), which costs $220.5 PHMSA re gulations also require pipeline operators to have pu blic safety notification programs, including for first responders a nd the local communit y in case of a pip eline sp ill explo liquids pipelines) . Both regulations incorpo- rate by reference the 2003 edition of API Standard RP 1162, \"Public Awareness Pr ograms f or Pipeline or nearby local government emer- gency response authority might well wish to know the 4 See https://www.astm.org /Standards/ F1313. htm. 5 ASME , legal oblig ations. That standard (now superseded by a second edition) presently costs $133.6 At times , AP I's list price for the incorporate d-by-referenc e versi on of RP 1162 has exceeded $1,000 . Peter Strauss, Private Standar ds Organizations and Public Law , 22 Wm. & Mary Bill of R ts. J. 497, 508, 5 35 n.255 (2013) .7 Under this regime of private control, standards with the force of law have also disappeared, al though agencies have not acted to repeal them. For example, c urrent Nu- clear Regulatory C ommi ssion safety requirements for nuclear power plant steel and co ncrete containment sys- tems incorporate po rtions of ASME standards that seem any price. See 10 C.F.R. \u00a7 50.34 (f)(3)(v)(A)(1) (incorpora ting portions of 1 980 edition of ASME B oiler and Pressur e Vessel Code Sectio n III Di- vision 2). ASME does not list the 1980 edition for sale, and it appears to be out of print.8 The 2017 edition of that 6 See API, Publications Store , API RP 1162 $ 120, AP I's cu rrent edition of the standard costs less than the superseded ve rsion that has been incorporat ed by refer- ence. See API, API Recommended 7 These examples not only evidence the access difficulti es but al- so hint at the mo nopoly potenti al resulting from an agency's decision to incorporate by reference . See Strauss, Private Standards Organ- izations , supra , at 509-10 (also discussing example of American Herbal Products Association pricing of \"must -have\" incorporated - by-reference standard, \"Herbs of Commerce,\" at while later, superseding was priced at $99.99 ). 8 See ASME, BPVC Section III -Rules (Footnote continued ) 12 section of standards is for sale at $560.9 Likewise, t he Food a nd D rug Adm inistration standar d for b ottled wa- ter \u00a7 165.110(a) (2)(iv). While the cur- rent edition is for sale at $850 and some former editions are available for $125 each, the edition incorporated by reference into the agency's regulation appears to be un a- vailable from the drafting organization .10 Some priv ate standards organizations, including ASTM and API, have elected to offer o nline \"read ing rooms\" for the parti cular standards that ha ve been in- corporated by rence into federal regulations. Alt- hough some orated material, i ncluding the toy safety standard , can be accessed in this way, onerous conditions a pply to obtain a ccess withou t charge . As ASTM acknowledges , access its rea ding room is \"read -only.\" ASTM Amicus Br . 26. But what ASTM does not make clear is that the webpage does not merel y bar dow nloading an entire standard , but blocks the text of the often -lengt hy standard s from being print- ed, saved, or cut and pasted in whole or in part . The ASTM reading room thus imped es all the ordinary ways in which a reader might engage legal text, i ncluding Amazon, Rules for Construction of Pressure Vessels/1 Construction -Pres sure -American -National -Stand ard/dp/9994291556 (stating that another section of the 1980 Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code is out of print) . 9 ASME, BPVC Section III-Rules for Construction of Nu clear Faci lity Comp onents, supra note 8. 10 quoting it in comments that can be shared with reg ulat- ing agencies or other co ncerned indivi duals. Moreover, the reading roo ms typically include o p- pressi ve click -through agreements as preconditions to seeing the incorporated standards. Before reading ASTM -drafted text with the force of law, for example, one must first pr ovide perso nal info rmation and then click \"AGREE\" to a lic ense . Under the terms of the li- cense , the licensee conced es that the mate rial is copy- right ed and promises not to \"t ransmit the content ... in any form ... or in any way exploit any of the mat erial ... without the ex press authorization of ASTM\" ; to indemni- fy ASTM for certain disputes; and ev en to agree that all disputes will be litiga ted in Pennsy lvania.11 These re- quirements f or acce ssing the law are remarkable in a demo cracy that prides itself on the rule o f law and o n the value of citizens' access to that law. API likewise r equires any indi vidual who wish es to read its standards that have been incorporated by refer- ence into fede ral regulations \u2014including its standard on pipeline o peration public awareness, RP 1162 \u2014to click on a l icense that warns that use of the standard is subject to similar limitations an d that \"API may pu rsue any remedy legally available to it if you fail t o compl y.\" It al- so requires the individual to agree to a District of Co- lumbia forum selection clause.12 The perso n must further agree that API may \"suspend or discontinue providing\" IBR standards \"with or wit hout cause and without no- tice.\" See Nina Mendelso n, Priv ate Control over Access 11 See ASTM , License Agreement, accessible after regi stering at https://www.astm.org/READ ING LIBRAR Y/VIEW/license.html . 14 to Public Law: The Federal Regulatory Use of Private Stan dards , 112 Mi ch.

For example , ASTM F1313 on pac- ifiers is reading room . Some organi- zations, including ASME, provide no o ption at all for ac- cess without charge . And although some federal agencies keep a paper copy of the standard for i nspect ion (but not copying), generally in a Washin gton, D.C. area head- quarters, even res idents of the D.C. area can face signifi- cant difficulties and this opportunity is useless, as a prac- tical matter, to indivi duals resi ding elsewher Hilzenr One Reporter's Runaround blic' Doc pur- chase is the only means of access . B. Obstacles to public access to stan dards in- corporated by reference hinder compliance with the law , public d iscu ssion of the law, and participation in governance. The difficulty of locating and the cost and cond itions of reading privately -controlled legal standards are signif- icant roadblocks to seeing the law. The o bstacles under- cut the due process -requir ed \"fa ir notice of conduct that is forbidden or required.\" FCC v. Fox Television St a- tions , 567 U.S. 23 9, 253 ( 2012). That standards may be \"technical and specialized,\" A STM Amicus Br. 6, under- scores the i mportance of access. Cf. Cheek v. Unit ed States, 498 U.S. 192, 205 (1991) (stating that \"in 'our complex tax system, uncertainty often arises even among taxpayers who earnestly wish to follow the law'\") (quo t- ing United St ates v. Bishop , 412 U.S. 346, 360 -61 (1973)). Thus, for example, s mall bu sinesses have repor ted that access difficulties impede their ability to know their 16 obligations. As the Modification and R eplacement Parts Association, an association of small supplier s of aircraft parts, stated in publicly -filed comments in an Office of the Federal Regi ster p roceeding, \"The burden of paying high costs simply to know the requirements of regula- tions may ... driv[e] small businesses and co mpetitors out of the market, or wor se endanger the safety of the flying public by making adherence to regula tions more difficult .\"15 Numerous other industry groups have made similar points.16 Likewise, the obstacles impede ac cess for local gov- ernments with responsibilities under federal law . For 15 gov/document? Ass'n, Comments , Proposed Rule- making f or Incorporation by Reference , at 1 (Dec. 30, 2013), https:/ /www.regulations. gov/document?D=OFR -2013 -0001-0019 (on behalf of 90% small business membership, stating acc ess costs \"can be significant for small businesses in a highly regulated environ- ment, such as the propane industry\"); Americ an Foundry Soci ety, Com ments , Incorporation by Reference (IBR) Notice , at 1 (June 1, can add several thousands of dollars of expenses per year to a small bu sines s, particularly manufac turers ....

For example, Vermont Leg al Aid has reported that the high costs of accessing rules that have been incorporated by reference impair s Medicare reci pients, particularly low - income seniors, from kno wing their rights and fili ng ef- fective appeals.18 The ba rriers to seeing l egal text als o frustrate the ability of citizens to make informed choices regarding wh ere to live, w hether to drink purified bot- tled water, or which toys or other products to buy for their children, as Consume r Reports has explained .19 Nonprofit organizations that advoc ate for cit izens have 17 N.Y.

These obstructions to seeing federal regulat ory law also corrode core governance mechanisms, i ncluding t he right of \"interested persons\" to petition agencies to change rules and to partic ipate in f ederal agency rule- making processes under the Administrative Procedure Act.21 The obstacles also impede public discu ssion of gov- ernment , which is critical to holding federal agencies ac- countable for its regulatory de cisions , inclu ding d ecisions to incorporat e private standards by reference . The goals of private standards may differ from the statutes that federal agencies are required to implement , and a p ri- vate standard need not meet any public process or con- sensus re quirement befo re an agency considers it fo r in- corporat ion by reference . Opportunities to participate in 20 See Public Citizen, et al., Comment s on NPRM, Incorporation by Reference , at 1 gov/docu ment?D=O -0031 (reportin g on profit, public interest organizations that \"free a ccess ... will strength en the capacity of organizations li ke ours to engage in rule- making processes, analyze issues, and work for solut ions to public policy challenges ... and strengt hen citizen participation in our de- mocracy\"). 21 The Administrative Procedure Act requires that \"inte rested persons\" be given an \"opportunity to participate\" in a rulemaking and to petition for amendment or a r epeal of a rule. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(c), (e). Although those issues are beyo nd the scope of this case, agency proposals to use, as well as final adoption of, incorporated -by- reference rules tha t are under priv ate control and subject to access restrictions also may violate section 553's critical public pa rticipation requirements and other laws governing the administrative state. 19 these priva te proce sses model s of some organiz ation s). With out fu ll access to federal regul atory text, the public cannot hold federal agencies a ccountable for t he content o f federal regulations, whether by discussing the regulat ions in their communities, petitioning the agency revision , wri ting thei r memb ers of Con- gress, or voting in the Presidential election. Cf. Globe New spaper Co. v. Superior Co urt for the Cty. of Norfolk , 457 U.S. 596, 604 (1982) (First Amendme nt requires open court records to protect the free discussion of go v- ernme nt affairs ); Leigh v .

No. 89-1497 at 2 (1966) (quoting Dr. Harold Cross). This Court has invali dated much smaller obstru ctions than those at issue here as inconsis tent with similar core 22 Some organizations express a laudable commitment to open- ness and balance, see AST M Amic us Br. at 2.

Draft standards often must be purchased from the o rganizatio n in or der to engage in any form of participation. See Mendelson, supra , at 780 -81. 20 principles of democratic government, such as the right to vote. Cf. Harper v. V a. State Bd. Of Elect ions, 383 U.S. 663, 666 -68 (1966) (invalida ting state $1.50 poll tax as ef- fective denial of right to vote); Lubin v. Panish, U .S. 709, 717-18 (1974) (stri king down $701 filing fee re- quirement for Cal ifornia election on equal pr otection grounds, given \" our tradition ... of hospitality toward all candidates without rega rd to their economic status\"). For many rules, moreover, budget c onstraints may be con- nected with substantive interests. For example, consu m- ers w ill likely have small er budgets than manufa cturers; families living near a pipeline will likely have smaller budgets than the pipeline operator. Requirements to pay to read the law can distinctively and s ystematically dis- advantage those interests. Finally , these obstructions are inconsistent with a centuries -long, constitutive American tradition of mean- ingful free access to our binding laws. That all citizens should be able to see the law is bedrock. In 1795, Con- gress provided for public printing of the la ws. See H.R. Journal, 3d Cong., 2d Sess. (describing Act of Mar. 3, 1795) . In the early 1800s, Co ngress provided free public access to federal statutes through a netw ork of state and territo rial libraries, followed by the cre ation of the Fede ral Depository Librar y Sy stem. Act of Dec. 23, 1817, res. 2, 3 Stat. 473; Act of Feb. 5, 1859, ch. 22, \u00a7 10, 11 Stat. 379, 381 . In the 1930s, Congress extended that access to f eder al regulations through t he Federal Register Act. See 44 U.S.C. \u00a7 1501 , et se q. Congress has further deepe ned the tr adition by requir ing the Go vern- ment Printing Office to make available universal online access to statutes and re gulation s. See 44 U.S.C. 21 \u00a7 4102(b ).23 Federal law also now req uires online pu blic access to a wide variety of government documents and materials , including nonbin ding agency guidance 5 U.S.C . \u00a7 552(a)(2) (reflecting an amend - ment made by the Electronic Freedom of I nformation of Act Amendments of 1996 ); E-Government Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-347, \u00a7\u00a7 206 , 207(f), 116 Stat. 2899, at 44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3501 note ). With the sole exception of legal obligations that are incorp orated by reference, all fed eral statutes and regulations are now freely available online and in the approximately 1,200 gover nmental depository libraries. at 764 -66. II. Private involvement in the drafting of l egal text does not imm unize it from the go vernment edicts doctrine. A. The government edicts doctrine bars th e as- sertion o f copyright when a go vernment adopts text as law. In regulating, federal agencies must de cide that gov- ernmental action is needed to address a problem and then, fo llowing appropriate administrative pr ocedure, promulgate the text that composes the co ntent o f binding regulatory law. When a n agency elect s to incorporate private text into the regul atory law, that text then be- comes the law. T he agency's decision \"convert s [its] terms into t he very stuff of legal obligation.\" Strauss , Private Standar ds Organizati ons, supra , at 513. The public's interest in kno wing its obligations and rights un- 23 44 U.S.C. \u00a7 4102(b) (2006) (capping r ecoverable costs as costs of dissemination\" and requi ring no -charge on line access in government depository libraries). The GPO does not char ge a fee for online access. 22 der the law, as well as in fully participating in our Repub- lic's go verning pr ocesses , because a pri- vate i ndividual has had a hand in drafting the text. In short, the adoption of text as havi ng legal force is su ffi- cient to make that text a gover nment edict and is thus sufficient for the government edicts doct rine to apply; a government official need not pen the standards. Below, t he Eleventh Circuit correctl y reasoned that the government edict s doctrine \"is dependent on wheth- er the work is the la w, or sufficiently like the law, so as to be deemed the product o f the di rect e xercise of sov ereign authority, and therefore attribu table to the constructive authorsh ip of the People.\" Pet. App. 25a; see also Banks v. Manchester, 128 U.S. 244, 253 (1888) ( stating that the \"work done by the judges constitut es exposition and in- terpret ation of the la w, which binding every citizen, is free for publication to all\") . The Fif th Circuit has like- wise reco gnized that, once incorporated into law, private code language \"enter[s] the public domain and [is] not subject to the copyrigh t holder 's excl usive pr F.3d 791, 793 th Cir. 2002) (en banc); see also Bl dg. Officials & Code Adm. v. Code Tech., Inc. , 628 F.2 d 730, 734 (1st Cir. 1980) (refu sing to enforce preliminary injun ction against p ublisher of s tate code that included text drawn from privately -drafted model building code). But see Practice Mgmt. Info. Corp. v. Am. Med. Ass'n , 121 F.3d 516, 518 (9th Cir. 1 997), , 133 F.3d 1140 (9th Cir. 1998) (pe rmitting AMA to r etain co pyright and control over sale of private standards despite adoption of them in Medic are and M edicaid regulations); CCC Info. Serv s. Inc. v. MacLean Hunter Mkt . Reports, Inc ., 44 F.3d 61, 67 (2d Cir. 1994) (permitting copyright owner to control Red Book aut omotive va lue data d espite state insurance statutes' reliance on them). 23 In an era wh ere gover nment officials increasingly outsource their work to the private sector, a ruling that the government edicts doctrine applie s only to law initial- ly penned by a gov ernment offic ial would effectively al- low private parties to control public access to the text of the law. Privately controlled legal ac cess could result when ever a regulator or legisl ature assembled the text of binding law by incorporating langu age from a publication created by any source, whether a standards organization, a private corpo ration, o r a law professor \u2014all of whom are regular participant s in rulemaking and lawmaking discu ssions. Adopt ing the argument of ASTM and other amici would thus enable pr ivate entities to wall of f signi f- icant portions of law from the public, with devastat ing results for fair notice, due process, and core governance processes. No statute requires such a result. The National Technology Transfer Act of 1995 encourage s agen cies to use \"technical s tandard s\" developed by \"voluntary con- sensus fied n othing in that Act indi- cates either Congress's endorsement of c urrent incorpo- ration by reference approach es or any aim to abandon the 185 -year -old govern ment edicts doctrine that the text of the law is not to be und er private control. Cf. Whitman v. American Trucking Ass'ns, 531 U.S. 457, 468 (2001) (Congress does not \"hide elephants in mouseholes\"). B. Copyright -facilitated sale of private i ncor- porated -by-reference standards is not the only r ecompense for private s tandards de- velopment . Standard s drafted by private organizations u ndoubt- edly possess significant value in a wide range of settings. Permitting private o rganizations to mai ntain copyrights 24 and, thus, sole control over a ccess to incor porated -by- reference te xt with the of law , howev er, is not per- mitted by the government edicts doctrine. It also is not the only means of r ewarding private organizations f or this work. First, it is not clear that the work of standards devel- opment org anizations would be negatively impacted by providing o pen access to the legal text that a federal agency has incorp orated by re ference. See Peter Strauss, Incorporating by Refe rence: Knowing the Law in the Electronic Age, 39 Winter Admin. & Reg. L. News 36 (2014) (reporting stat ement of head of National Fire Pro- tection Agency that NFPA had provided online access to standards \"with out appr eciable damage to a financial base heavil y dependent on sales of its standards\"). These organizations ge nerally do not ob ject to and even advo- cate for agency ut ilization of th eir standards as the bind- ing law. As one very recent example, API suggest ed in- corpor ation of one of its standard s in a recent Interior Department rulema king govern ing oil well blowout pre- venter systems in the Outer Co ntinenta l Shelf.24 Incor- poration by re ference can be a point of pride . See gener- ally Strauss, Private Standards O rganiz ations , supra , at 509-10 (discussing considerations that may offset any reduced market for standards that have been incorpo- rated into federal law). For example, ANSI adverti ses 24 See API, et al., Comment , Blowout Preventer Systems and Well Control Revisions, at 6, 2018 ), https://www.regulations. gov/document?D=BSEE -2018 -0002 -45174 (stating that \"considera- tion for incorporation by reference should be taken to ensure the U.S. OCS is operating to the la test API standa rd for well control systems \" and \"industry [also] requests that [the agency ] align the proposed changes to the Well Control Rule with the 21 -day testing interval outlined in API Standard 53\"). 25 that membership benefits include \" Influenc[ing] U.S. and ANSI Positio already d o pro- vide private drafting orga nizations with support. That support can include \"direct financial su pport (e.g., grants, memberships, and contra cts),\" as w ell as admin- istrative support and techn ical support, i ncluding the participation o f agency personnel. OMB , Circular A -119, supr a note 3 (\"What forms of support may my agency provide to standards deve lopme nt?\"). If a private organi- zation cient reward from an agen- cy's adoptio of text it had prepared, it could nego tiate with the regulating agency to pay it for the us e of its text, effe ctively contracting for the work. See Strauss, Private Standards Organizations , supra , at 515. If a private organization were not interested in negotia ting, the federal agency would fa ce a choice be twee n taking particular text, subje ct to any organization al right to compensation, or drafting its own d istinctive la nguage. See id . at 546; Emily Bremer, On the Cost of Private Standards in Public Law, 63 Kan. L. Rev. 279, 294 (2015) ( sugges ting that \"affected cop yright owners may have a v iable takings claim\"). In short, a public -private partnership in sta ndards development could take any of several paths . The g ov- ernment edicts doctrine and the imp ortant public policy considerations it serve s foreclose on ly one such path. The text of the b inding law may not be left under the private control represented by t he copyright regime. 26 CONCLUSION For the foregoing reason s and the reasons set forth in the br ief of respondent , the decision below should be affirmed .
