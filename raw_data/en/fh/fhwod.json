They can also be found in the vagina, cervix, and bladder, although less commonly than other locations in the pelvis.

Blood from these cells causes deposits to accumulate and form scar tissue, which can be very painful. Endometriosis affects 10 % - 20% of American women of childbearing age and is one of the main causes of infertility in women. One-third of women with endometriosis have no symptoms.
