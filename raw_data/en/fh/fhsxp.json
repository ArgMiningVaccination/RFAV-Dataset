It was designed to create optimal well-being in the Body, Mind and Spirit. Natural Force Healing utilizes a spectrum of healing vibrations or energies known as the Positive Universal Force Energies. Natural Force Healing measures the need of 12 specific levels of energy directed at sixteen specific contact points on the body. The need for each level is dependent upon precise reflex points. Each reflex and level of energy corresponds to a particular physical, mental/emotional, or spiritual issue that is being presented at the time of treatment. When applied through specific hand positions placed upon designated areas of the body, a peeling away of distortions accumulated over an Individual's life begins to happen. Not only will the individual experience physical changes, but they will report tremendous changes in their spiritual and mental-emotional health as well. The purpose of the hand positions is to allow the amplification of these specific force levels to accomplish in minutes clinically applicable changes in a human being physically, mentally, and spiritually. The Science of Natural Force Healing is based upon Vibration Therapy. Simply stated, all matter in the universe is comprised of molecules which are in constant motion, vibrating at different rates of vibration and frequencies. The density of matter is determined by the rate or frequency level of the vibrating molecules it contains. Different molecules vibrate at different rates. Every cell of the body has a specific normal vibratory rate. When this normal rate is maintained, the cells and thus the organs exhibit good health. The human body is thus made up of numerous vibrations that together vibrate within a specific range when we are in a state of health. "}
