For decades, scientists have observed an extraordinarily positive side effect among children who receive the measles vaccine: Deaths from measles plummet among vaccinated children, and so do deaths from unrelated diseases like pneumonia and diarrhea. The same result has been found as a consequence of live polio vaccine and bacille Calmette-Guerin, or BCG, vaccine for tuberculosis. When those vaccines are introduced to poor areas of the world, studies have shown, deaths from many other causes, not just the vaccine-targeted disease, go down...\" (Brink, 3/4). [STAT](https://www.statnews.com/2019/03/04/vaccines-no-association-autism-major-study/): It's old news that vaccines don't cause autism. But a major new study aims to refute skeptics again \"A massive new [study](https://annals.org/aim/article-abstract/2727726/measles-mumps-rubella-vaccination-autism-nationwide-cohort-study) from Denmark found no association between being vaccinated against measles, mumps, and rubella and developing autism. In science and public health circles, that issue has long since been considered settled ... But the size of this study \u2014 involving 657,461 Danish children born between 1999 and 2010 \u2014 should, in theory, bolster the argument that doctors and public health professionals still find themselves forced to make in the face of entrenched and growing resistance to vaccination in some quarters...\" (Branswell, 3/4).
