We present cardiovascular gross and histopathology findings from a 11-year-old MPS VII male, who expired after developing ventricular fibrillation following anesthesia induction. Gross anatomic observations were samples the carotid artery, hematoxylin-eosin, Verhoeff-Van Gieson, CD68, and trichrome stains. Gross heart findings include an enlarged, dilated heart, mitral valve prolapse with thick, Similar findings visualized aortic intimal plaques. We confirm that arterial plaques, elastin fragmentation, and activated CD68+ macrophage infiltration occur in human MPS VII, consistent with previously observed findings in murine and canine MPS VII. We also confirm ultrasonographically observed carotid intimal-medial thickening histopathologic vascular fibrointimal hyperplasia. MPS VII patients should be regularly monitored for cardiac disease, with methods such as Holter monitors and stress testing; MPS VII-directed treatments should effectively address cardiovascular disease.
