A plethora of online workout classes and Youtube fitness channels have made home workouts more convenient than ever. With just a yoga mat and a pair of dumbbells, you can get a full body workout right in the comfort of your own home. It was last year that my old yoga mat literally started to fall apart. After doing some research, I learned that most yoga mats are made of toxic materials like PVC and phthalates that are [endocrine disruptors](https://umbelorganics.com/endocrine-disrupting-chemicals/) and are also bad for the environment. I wrote a post on [non-toxic yoga mats and shared my favorite yoga mats](https://umbelorganics.com/non-toxic-yoga-mats/). But what about other workout equipment like fitness weights? Dumbbells can be made with toxic materials like phthalates and exercise balls can be made with PVC. Look below for the harmful chemicals that may be lurking in your fitness gear and what to avoid. We've got you covered if you're looking for non-toxic fitness mats, non-toxic dumbbells, non-toxic fitness rings and more. Harmful Chemicals To Avoid In Fitness Gear Phthalates- Phthalates are plasticizers that are added to everything from yoga mats to fitness weights to make the plastic used in the product more pliable. Phthalates are added to all sorts of common household items like cosmetics, containers for food and drinks and baby toys. Phthalates have been linked to a variety of health concerns, including [endocrine disruption](https://umbelorganics.com/endocrine-disrupting-chemicals/), [impacts to reproductive systems](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2706654/) and some [forms of cancer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30336412). BPA- Plastics used for yoga mats and fitness weights may contain this endocrine-disruptor. A [2018 study](https://doi.org/10.1210/js.2018-00151) linked BPA with significant changes in insulin response levels, and a [2019 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31310111) found a positive association between BPA and coronary heart disease. PVC- Exposure to PVC, aka Polyvinyl Chloride, is [associated with an increased risk of certain cancers](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/substances/vinyl-chloride). Toxic metals are used as stabilizers in [PVC](http://pvcinformation.org/assets/pdf/PbCdChildrenProducts.pdf), including lead, a neurotoxin, and cadmium, a carcinogen. Aside from the human health impacts, PVC is an environmental pollutant. During various stages of [PVC production and disposal](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/substances/vinyl-chloride), dioxins and mercury are released into our air, water and soil. [Dioxin](https://www.cehn.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/PVCandPthalates_Feb-2016.pdf) is a well-known carcinogen and can affect the reproductive, immune, endocrine and neurological systems. California Proposition 65 Warning Label You may see the California Proposition 65 warning label on some, if not most, fitness equipment. There are currently over [900 chemicals on this list](https://oehha.ca.gov/proposition-65/proposition-65-list), including some phthalates and formaldehyde. If your fitness gear does not include the California Proposition 65 warning label, this may be a good indication that your fitness gear does not contain harmful chemicals. I'm sharing a list of fitness gear that's perfect for your home gym and doesn't contain toxic chemicals like phthalates and PVC. When it comes to non-toxic yoga mats, dumbbells and fitness balls, you can work out knowing that you're not being exposed to harmful chemicals. Look below for the best non-toxic fitness gear that's perfect for your home gym. Have you noticed a Prop 65 warning on your fitness weights? That's because most fitness weights contain [Di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP)](https://www.p65warnings.ca.gov/fact-sheets/di2-ethylhexylphthalate-dehp), and may release small amounts over time. If you already have weights with this warning, wash your hands after every use. The weights below are made from materials like wood, chrome, cast iron and stainless steel, and don't come with warnings.

Bala also offers a [Bala Stretching Kit](https://bala.pxf.io/MXZRA2) that includes an Hourglass Silicone Roller, a Balance Block, a Fabric & Silicone Ban, and a fabric tote, which are all consciously designed for stretching, yoga, rehabilitation, and more.

Getting fit shouldn't expose you to harmful chemicals like [Poly Vinyl Chloride (PVC)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/TSP/ToxFAQs/ToxFAQsDetails.aspx?faqid=281&toxid=51), but your fitness bench most likely has a cushion cover made of PVC. PVC can leach [endocrine disruptors](https://umbelorganics.com/endocrine-disrupting-chemicals/) that can be absorbed by your skin (especially if you're wearing a sports bra with no shirt).
