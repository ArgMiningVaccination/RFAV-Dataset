His philosophy is that the body has an innate wisdom and the tools and services he provides support your neuro-somatic body to heal. Dante sees private clients, teaches classes in physical exercise, yoga, meditation, and qi gong, and performs monthly Sound Healing Concerts. Holistic practitioners such as Acupuncturists, Chiropractors, herbalists, and Ayurveda inspired him to teach preventative care measures. Dante's first impactful spiritual experience was when he worked with plant medicines at 19. Various visual experiences taught him the importance of staying centered during times of chaos. A few months later, he practiced Transcendental Meditation, which utterly changed his life. \"My vision for planet Earth is to see an autonomous holistic center fully operational in every town.
