In some European countries with lower levels of vaccine coverage, however, deaths from measles are still common and the disease is associated with significant morbidity. 1 In recent years adverse publicity surrounding the vaccine has depressed vaccine uptake in the United Kingdom. Parental attitude towards disease is known to be a powerful predictor of vaccine uptake. 2 Indeed, reports from the Health Education Authority tracking studies of parental attitudes to vaccination suggest that confidence in the safety of MMR vaccine has fallen in parallel with vaccine uptake, 3 and many parents now consider the vaccine to be a greater threat to their child's health than measles itself. Methods and Results An outbreak of measles among children from a predominantly un-immunised anthroposophical community in Gloucestershire provided an opportunity to explore parental views and study disease severity in this group. Anthroposophy is a spiritual movement that follows the teachings of Rudolf Steiner, an Austrian philosopher and scientist born in 1861. The term literally implies a wisdom about man, which is produced by the higher self in man and achieved through meditation and concentration. 4 Anthroposophical medicine advocates freedom of choice in health care and natural remedies. This type of medical practice is in favour of letting the body experience certain infections and is against the overuse of antibiotics, antipyretics and certain immunisations. Many adherents oppose the measles vaccine because they believe children gain physical and mental robustness from natural measles infection, when supported by appropriate nursing care. Indeed, as Hanratty et al note \"the avoidance of immunisation in these communities is more than a refusal to accept conventional medicine\". 5 A postal questionnaire was sent to notified cases of measles from the 1997/8...
