Gallatin and his cofounders envisioned a \"national university\" that would provide a \"rational and practical education for all.\" The result of the founders' foresight is today a university that is recognized both nationally and internationally as a leader in scholarship. NYU is one of only 60 universities in the nation to have member- ship in the distinguished Association of American Universities. Students come to NYU from all 50 states and from 145 foreign countries. New York University includes three degree- granting campuses: New York, United States; Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates; and Shanghai, China. In addition, the University has 11 global academic centers: Accra, Ghana; Prague, Czech Republic; Sydney, Australia; Tel Aviv, Israel; and Washington, DC, United States. Although overall the University is large, the divisions are small- to moderate-size units\u2014each with its own traditions, programs, and faculty. Enrollment in the undergraduate divisions at NYU ranges between 124 and 7,341, and the University offers over 9,000 courses and grants more than 25 different degrees. Classes vary in size, but the University strives to create a sense of community among students within and among the different disciplines. The founding of New York University in 1831 by a group of eminent private citizens marked a historic event in American education. In the early 19th century, the major emphasis in higher education was on the mastery of Greek and Latin, with little attention given to modern subjects. The founders of New York University intended to enlarge the scope of higher education to meet the needs of those aspiring to careers in business, industry, science, and the arts, as well as in law, medicine, and the ministry. The opening of the University of London in 1828 convinced New Yorkers that New York, too, should have a new university that fed off the energy and vibrancy of the city. 6 INTRODUCTION TO NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITY C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITY1832 College of Arts and Science cas.nyu.edu 1835 School of Law www.law.nyu.edu 1841 School of Medicine school.med.nyu.edu 1854 Polytechnic School of Engineering (January 2014) www.poly.edu 1865 College of Dentistry www.nyu.edu/dental (including the College of Nursing [1947], www.nyu.edu/nursing) 1886 Graduate School of Arts and Science www.gsas.nyu.edu1890 Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development steinhardt.nyu.edu 1900 Leonard N.

Bobst Library serves as a center for the NYU community's intellectual life. With 4.4 million print volumes, 146,000 serial subscriptions, 85,000 electronic journals, 900,000 e-books, 171,000 audio and video recordings, and 40,000 linear feet of special collections archival materials, the collections are uniquely strong in the performing arts, radical and labor history, and the history of New York and its avant- garde culture. The library's website, library.nyu.edu, received 2.4 million visits in 2011- 2012. Bobst Library offers approximately 2,500 seats for student study. The Avery Fisher Center for Music and Media, one of the world's largest academic media centers, has 134 carrels for audio listening and video viewing and three multimedia classrooms. The Digital Studio offers a constantly evolving, leading-edge resource for faculty and student projects and promotes and supports access to digital resources for teaching, learning, research, and arts events. The Data Service Studio provides expert staff and access to software, statistical computing, geographical infor- mation systems analysis, data collection resources, and data management services in support of quantitative research at NYU. The Fales Library, a special collection within Bobst Library, is home to the unparalleled Fales Collection of English and American Literature; the Marion Nestle Food Studies Collection, the country's largest trove of cookbooks, food writing, pamphlets, paper, and archives, dating from the 1790s; and the Downtown Collection, an extraordinary multimedia archive documenting the avant-garde New York art world since 1975. Bobst Library also houses the Tamiment Library, the country's leading repository of research materials in the history of left politics and labor. T wo fellowship programs bring scholars from around the world to Tamiment to explore the history of the Cold War and its wide-ranging impact on American institutions and to research academic freedom and promote public discussion of its history and role in our society. Tamiment's Robert F . Wagner Labor Archives contain, among other resources, the archives of the Jewish Labor Committee and of more than 200 New York City labor organizations. Beyond Bobst, the library of the renowned Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences focuses on research-level material in mathematics, computer science, and related fields. The Stephen Chan Library of Fine Arts at the Institute of Fine Arts (IFA) houses the rich collections that support the research and curricular needs of the institute's graduate programs in art history and archaeology. The Jack Brause Library at SCPS Midtown, the most comprehensive facility of its kind, serves the information needs of every sector of the real estate com-munity. The Library of the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World (ISAW) is a resource for advanced research and gradu-ate education in ancient civilizations from the western Mediterranean to China. The Bern Dibner Library serves NYU Poly. The libraries of NYU Abu Dhabi and NYU Shanghai provide access to all the resources in BobCat and are building their own collection of books and other print materi-als in support of the schools' developing curricula. Complementing the collections 7 INTRODUCTION TO NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITY C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYof the Division of Libraries are those of the libraries of NYU's School of Medicine, Dental Center, and School of Law. The NYU Division of Libraries continually enhances its student and faculty services and expands its research collections, responding to the extraordinary growth of the University's academic programs in recent years and to the rapid expansion of electronic information resources. Bobst Library's professional staff includes more than 33 subject specialists who select materials and work with faculty and graduate students in every field of study at NYU. The staff also includes specialists in undergraduate outreach, instructional services, preservation, electronic informa- tion, and digital information. The l arger c ampus New York University is an integral part of the metropolitan community of New York City\u2014the business, cultural, artistic, and financial center of the nation and the home of the United Nations. The city's extraor-dinary resources enrich both the academic programs and the experience of living at New York University. Professors whose extracurricular activities include service as editors for publishing houses and magazines; as advisers to city government, banks, school systems, and social agencies; and as consultants for museums and industrial corporations bring to teaching an experience of the world and a professional sophistication that are difficult to match. Students also, either through course work or in outside activities, tend to be involved in the vigorous and varied life of the city. Research for term papers in the humanities and social sciences may take them to such diverse places as the American Museum of Natural History, the Museum of Modern Art, a garment factory, a deteriorating neighborhood, or a foreign consulate. Students in science work with their professors on such problems of immediate importance for urban society as the pol- lution of waterways and the congestion of city streets. Business majors attend seminars in corporation boardrooms and intern as executive assistants in business and financial houses. The schools, courts, hospitals, settlement houses, theatres, playgrounds, and prisons of the greatest city in the world form a regular part of the educational scene for students of medicine, dentistry, education, social work, law, business and public administration, and the creative and performing arts. The chief center for undergraduate and graduate study is at Washington Square in Greenwich Village, long famous for its contributions to the fine arts, literature, and drama and its personalized, small- erscale, European style of living. New York University itself makes a significant contribution to the creative activity of the Village through the high concentration of faculty and students who reside within a few blocks of the University. University apartment buildings provide housing for over 2,100 members of the faculty and administration, and University student residence halls accommodate over 11,000 men and women. Many more faculty and students reside in private hous-ing in the area. a Private University Since its founding, New York University has been a private university. It operates under a board of trustees and derives its income from tuition, endowment, grants from private foundations and government, and gifts from friends, alumni, corporations, and other private philanthropic sources. The University is committed to a policy of equal treatment and opportunity in every aspect of its relations with its faculty, students, and staff members, without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender and/or gender identity or expression, marital or parental status, national origin, ethnicity, citizenship status, veteran or military status, age, disability, and any other legally protected basis.

John W. Draper invented modern photography, and the American Chemical Society was founded here. In the arts and culture, too, it can be argued that the College not only participated in but also generated much of the creative energy that has characterized Greenwich Village. The original University Building housed ateliers that were the forerunners of the current downtown art scene. And although Henry Wadsworth Longfellow was turned down for a teaching post, literature thrived, with University Building even featured in an 1861 novel by Theodore Winthrop. Finally, this neighborhood and this institution have had a long tradition of social and political activism\u2014from the Stonecutters Riot over the construction of the University's first building in 1834 to the tragic T riangle Shirtwaist Factory fire in 1911, a major event in U.S. labor history that took place in what is now the Brown Building. From its earliest days, then, the College on Washington Square has been at the cutting edge of intellectual, cultural, and social developments. In 1895, however, NYU's great chancellor, Henry McCracken, decided to reserve Washington Square for the professional schools, which had prolifer- ated under his leadership, and to move University College to a beautiful campus in the Bronx\u2014University Heights\u2014designed by Stanford White. The College's move to the Heights reflected McCracken's \"Ivy\" aspirations for the school and his successful effort to raise quality by attracting the best students nationally. Also relevant was the ascendant, non-urban collegiate ideal of a residential community, with fine teaching, extracurricular activities, fraternities, and intercollegiate athletics. A few years later, an undergraduate presence was restored downtown with the opening of a Collegiate Division (1903), soon to become Washington Square College (1913). This school had a more diverse student body, opening its doors to women, recent immigrants, commuters, and professional students. For over 60 years, undergraduate liberal arts education at NYU took place in two locations\u2014University College (and the Engineering School) at the Heights and the College on Washington Square, both offering excellent, but different, educational and social experiences. In the 1970s, the College underwent yet another major transformation. In response to financial pressures, the Heights campus was closed in 1973, and University College merged with Washington Square College. The new institution, which is now known simply as the College of Arts and Science, is the beneficiary of both traditions\u2014the Heights' residential and collegiate culture and the Square's progressive urban focus. At that time, a decision was also made to build aggressively for quality\u2014to recruit the very best faculty and students, to update and expand the physical plant, and to create distinguished programs both here and abroad. In recent years, the College has become recognized as a national leader for its efforts to reinvent a liberal arts education for the 21st century. With a challenging liberal arts foundation, the College Core Curriculum, at the center of the under-graduate experience, the College emphasizes student inquiry and research, offers unique opportunities for international and pre-professional study, and makes use of the city as a site for learning and service. A liberal arts education thus reconceived is not only personally enriching but also eminently practical in developing the skills and perspectives essential to assume a leadership role in the 21st century. As the new millennium proceeds, the College continues to build on its founders' goal of providing \"Useful Knowledge.\"The history of the College of Arts and Science begins with the founding of the University by a number of prominent New Yorkers, led by Albert Gallatin, a member of Jefferson's cabinet. Unlike other insti- tutions at the time, it was to be nonsectarian and to produce a different sort of elite citizen, not born to privilege but set apart for leadership by talent and effort. To that end, it provided a more practical education, what the 19th century called \"Useful knowledge.\"14 College Directory COLLEGE DIRECTORY C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYG.

Study of a foreign language 2. The Expository Writing Program 3. Foundations of Contemporary Culture (FCC)4. Foundations of Scientific Inquiry (FSI) Though structured and integrated, the Core Curriculum affords students flexibility in a number of ways. It permits the choice of different tracks in each component, the satisfaction of some courses by examination or Advanced Placement (or equivalent international) credit (foreign language, FSI), and the substitution of departmental courses (FSI, and certain requirements in FCC). Given this flexibility, students work individually with advisers to plan course schedules that take into account their past preparation, current interests, and longer-term goals. While there is no prescribed schedule of courses that will be appropriate for every student, the following broad guidelines should be kept in mind: Incoming freshmen should complete their Core courses by the end of sophomore year. This will leave them free in their junior and senior years to focus on their major and elective courses. Some science majors, engineering students, prehealth students, and students placed in the International Writing Workshop sequence may need to delay starting, and thus finishing, a component of the Core Curriculum for a semester or more. Students who study away may also need to delay completing their Core courses beyond the sophomore year. Students must complete Writing the Essay (EXPOS-UA 1) during their first year. Those placed into the Liberal Studies Writing or International Writing Workshop sequences must begin in their first semester and must register for their remaining writing course(s) in the semester(s) immediately following. In designing the College Core Curriculum, the faculty sought to ensure that all students would receive a broad exposure to the liberal arts early in their college careers. With this wide academic horizon, the Core Curriculum encourages students to discover new intellectual interests outside their intended areas of specialization and to pursue those interests with elective courses outside their majors in their later undergraduate years.Programdirector of the c ollege c ore curriculum Professor Semple director of the expository Writing Program To be announced director of Undergraduate Studies for the f oundations of contemporary culture Clinical Professor Renzi director of Undergraduate Studies for the f oundations of Scientific Inquiry Clinical Professor JordanThe Core Curriculum of the College of Arts and Science provides a foundational academic experience of general education in the liberal arts for undergraduates at NYU. Through a challenging array of courses, the College Core Curriculum heightens cultural awareness, hones critical reading skills, and promotes creative and logical thinking. It also gives students extensive practice writing and speaking English and proficiency in at least one other language. Rather than specifying a fixed canon of knowledge, Core courses focus on modes and methods of humanistic and scientific inquiry. In each case, students are free to pursue particular interests by choosing among a number of courses. Students examine our contemporary culture\u2014its origins and social structures, its modes of expression, and its inherent diversity and evolving patterns of thought. In other classes, they consider the place and importance of modern science\u2014its quantitative and analytical foundations, its processes of reasoning, and its relationship to technology and to our views of the natural world. By helping them to broaden their perspectives, gain new pathways for intellectual inquiry, and develop the skills, background, and social awareness to thrive in dynamic circumstances, the Core Curriculum seeks to prepare students for their later studies and to equip them well for lives as thinking individuals and members of society. www.core.cas.nyu.edu Silver Center 100 Washington Square East, Room 903 New York, NY 10003-6680 212-998-8119The College Core Curriculum18 COLLEGE CORE CURRICULUM COLLEGE CORE CURRICULUM C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYThe study of foreign languages is an integral part of a liberal arts education. It nurtures an awareness of the diversity of human culture and serves the practical need for language skills in fields such as govern-ment, business, and research. New York University is a particularly exciting setting for language study because of its location in a great cosmopolitan city, its international student body, its many renowned language programs and centers, and its numerous opportunities for study away. In addition to the foreign language courses offered for academic credit, the College offers opportunities for students of modern languages to practice their skills in real-world situations outside the classroom. NYU Speaking Freely is a free, noncredit program that allows students to practice their speaking and aural comprehension skills and to explore the linguistically diverse cultures of New York City. For more information about this popular program, con- tact the Office of the Associate Dean for Students, Silver Center, 100 Washington Square East, Room 909; 212-998-8140; speakingfreely.cas.nyu.edu. Increasingly, college graduates must be prepared to function in a global society. Apart from the inherent interest of learning about other cultures, many NYU students take the opportunity to study or travel abroad as preparation for their future careers.

Requirement To fulfill the foreign language component of the College Core Curriculum, students must show or attain proficiency in a foreign language through the intermediate level. Ordinarily, this is accomplished by the successful completion of two years of language study in the College, through the second semester of a regular intermediate-level language sequence. Some languages are also taught as intensive courses, allowing students to complete the equivalent of two years of study in a single year. After two years of college language study or the equivalent demonstrated proficiency, students should have gained a broad competence in a language, but true fluency of written or oral expression will not usually have been developed at this point. For this reason, all students are encouraged to continue their language study beyond the intermediate level. In particular, students studying modern languages will find it most beneficial to immerse themselves in the living culture of a language by studying, traveling, or working abroad. Likewise, students of all languages, whether ancient or modern, are encouraged to con- tinue their studies with elective courses in literature at the advanced level. Exemptions Students may fulfill the foreign language component of the College Core Curriculum by presenting out- standing scores on the SAT Subject Test or Advanced Placement Test (or equivalent international examina-tion) in certain foreign languages, or by passing a departmental proficiency examination. For further information on language placement and exemption, see \"placement examinations\" in the academic poli- cies section of this Bulletin. For Advanced Placement Test and international examination equivalencies, consult the chart in the admission section, also in this Bulletin. Students whose secondary schooling was in a language other than English and other than a language offered in the College, or who complete the International Writing Workshop I, II sequence (EXPOS-UA 4, 9), are exempt from the foreign language requirement. Also exempt are students in the dual-degree engineering program. Courses Listed below are courses covering the second semester of the intermediate level of language study. Intensive courses, which allow students to complete the equivalent of two years of study in a single year, are also listed where available. Completion of any of the following courses will fulfill the foreign language requirement. Please consult the individual departmental listings for information on prerequisite courses.

Not every language is offered at Columbia every semester. eXPo SITorY WrITINgIt is difficult to exaggerate the value of clear and effective writing. The Expository Writing Program at NYU assumes that writing is not merely a useful skill but also a way of learning and knowing. Its courses focus on the examination of evidence, the development of ideas, and the clear expression of those ideas in a variety of different kinds of essays. In these writing courses, students routinely move from exploration to argument as they read and make use of various texts\u2014written, visual, experiential\u2014to create a spectrum of persuasive essays. Examined texts become more complex, and the writing tasks more difficult, as students grapple with intrigu- ing questions that lead to richer ideas and more interesting forms of expression. The essays students write become more formal and argumentative as the semester's work progresses. For a complete description of the curriculum, see the Expository Writing Program section of this Bulletin.20 COLLEGE CORE CURRICULUM COLLEGE CORE CURRICULUM C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYThe Foundations of Contemporary Culture (FCC) sequence of the College Core Curriculum is a series of four coordinated courses in the humanities and social sciences. Within each of the four offerings, students are free to pursue their particular interests through their choice of individual classes. Overall, the structure of the FCC ensures that every student in the College gains a common core of skills and experien1d in this Bulletin, detailed descriptions of each year's course offerings may be found on the Core Curriculum website. Texts and Ideas Texts and Ideas introduces students to the ideals of liberal education and the central role of humanistic study in the liberal arts and fosters appreciation of the importance of humanistic learning for society at large. Students become acquainted with some of the literary and philosophical works that have been most influential in shaping the contemporary world and with significant instances in which the ideas in these works have been debated, developed, appropriated, or rejected. Texts and Ideas is not a survey but, rather, an exami- nation of how texts influence subsequent thinking, create traditions, and reflect societal ideals. Texts and Ideas thus aims to provide a richer understand-ing of how cultures are constructed, modified, and represented. cultures and c ontexts Cultures and Contexts prepares students for life in a globalized world by introducing them to the ways in which humans come to understand themselves as members of social, religious, national, and regional collectives and by fostering their appreciation of the dynamics of cultural interaction and influ-ence. Individual sections focus on specific social or cultural groups different from the dominant tradi- tions of contemporary North America. They share a common concern to examine the ways cultures have interacted, for example, through trade, coloniza- tion, immigration, religious dispersion, and media representation; how such groups define themselves against internal and external difference; and how the dominant perspective of Western modernity affects comprehension of the ways in which people outside that position understand, experience, and imagine their lives. Offerings include emergent traditions, diaspora formations, and societies understood as nationally, geographically, or culturally distinct from the domi-nant traditions of contemporary North America. Courses focusing on ancient civilizations are also included, as are courses that address contemporary challenges to traditional European conceptions of national identity Societies and the Social Sciences Over the past several centuries, enormous social transformations have taken place around the world. To understand the complexity of these phenomena, new methods have been developed to study societal structures and human behavior. Each of the courses under Societies and the Social Sciences begins from a particular disciplinary approach, social concern, or topic, in order to orient students to the characteristic methods of these social sciences. Students learn how issues are objectified for study, how data are collected and analyzed, and how new understanding is thereby achieved. Whether through an interdis-ciplinary approach, consideration of their historical development, or reflection on critical and positivistic debates, the courses help students both to appreciate the unique insights afforded by these methods and to recognize the limits of such inquiry. In this way, students move beyond the particular focus of the class to a broader understanding of methods and problems in the social sciences generally. expressive culture In Expressive Culture, students explore the complexities of artistic expression in various media: sounds, images, words, performance, or film. Each course introduces requisite historical, formal, and critical vocabularies; examines fundamental issues associated with interpretation of the arts making use of these media; and investigates the complex relations between artistic activity and other facets of social organization. The courses also make use, whenever possible, of the rich cultural resources of New York City.foUNda TIoNS of coNTemPorar Y cUlTUre21 COLLEGE CORE CURRICULUM COLLEGE CORE CURRICULUM C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYThe Foundations of Scientific Inquiry (FSI) compo- nent of the College Core Curriculum is a series of three coordinated courses in quantitative reasoning and the natural sciences. Together, these courses ensure that every student in the College gains a fundamental understanding of how mathematics and laboratory experimentation advance scientific investigation. While some students acquire this background through course work offered in the sci- ence majors and the prehealth track, FSI courses are especially designed to meet the needs of nonscience students. Within each of the three offerings, students are free to pursue their particular interests through their choice of individual classes. In addition to the information on the FSI provided in this Bulletin, detailed descriptions of each year's course offerings may be found on the Core Curriculum website. Quantitative reasoning Students in Quantitative Reasoning engage mathematical concepts in a variety of contexts in the natural or social sciences. All courses include a substantial amount of problem solving that requires both conceptual and computational work. Natural Science I Scientific knowledge has its basis in our natural curiosity about the world around us and our place in it. These courses approach the physical sciences with the intent of asking and trying to answer interesting questions, dealing with topics ranging from the origin of our universe and planet to how human activity affects our environment. Students consider the important roles played by laws of physics and chemistry in biology, earth and environmental sciences, astrophysics, and cosmol- ogy; they also develop an understanding of how the physical sciences inform the natural sciences generally. Mathematics is introduced in each course with frequent applications to the subject matter. Predictions that can be made only with the use of mathematics are clearly delineated, showing the powerful role it plays in our understanding of the universe. Wherever possible, the courses relate science to societal problems and develop a historical perspective. Natural Science II The complexity of the biological realm continues to fascinate and challenge modern scientists, who are currently engaged in such diverse pursuits as exploring the organization and function of the brain, reconstructing the origin of the human species, link- ing the multiplicity of interactions in ecosystems, and deciphering the influence of heredity on com- plex traits. The courses in Natural Science II take a nontraditional approach to the life sciences, with an emphasis on approaching science as a dynamic process of investigation and discovery. Each course selects a broad theme that is at the forefront of contemporary research, then uses specific questions and examples to introduce students to the method- ology of scientific inquiry, the critical evaluation of results, and the mathematical tools used to quantify scientific information.foUNda TIoNS of ScIeNTIfIc INQUIr Y22 CAS SEMINARS C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYwww.cas.nyu.edu/page/ug.honorsprograms Silver Center 100 Washington Square East, Room 908, New York, NY 10003-6688 Phone: 212-998-8110 director of c ollege honors To be announced freshman Seminars The freshman seminars (FS), required of all incoming students, aim to put first-year students into contact with leading thinkers (both distinguished faculty members and eminent visitors), to introduce them to important subjects, to challenge them intellectually through rigorous standards of analysis and oral and written argumenta-tion, and to prepare them to conduct their own research. To that end, the freshman seminars stress demanding readings and writing assignments that introduce students to an essential research skill\u2014such as a literature review, quantitative reasoning, critical use of primary sources, the identification of a research problem, critical analysis of texts, or confrontations with works of art. In addition to participating actively in class discussions, students are often expected to give oral presentations in class. A final paper will typically, though not always, have gone through one or more revisions, perhaps revised with the benefit of in-class comments. In other fresh-man seminars, the focus may be on individual or group projects. advanced h onors Seminars The advanced honors seminar (AHS) program extends the principles and approach of the freshman seminars to upper-level courses. These courses aim to put undergraduates into contact with leading thinkers (drawn not only from the College's faculty but also from NYU's professional schools and from among New York's professional, cultural, and governmental leaders), to introduce them to important subjects, to challenge them intellectually through demanding standards of analysis and oral and written argumentation, and to prepare them to conduct their own research (for example, a Dean's Undergraduate Research Fund grant or a senior honors thesis). In some instances, students may count an advanced honors seminar toward their major or minor, if the department considers this appropriate; in other cases, these seminars count as electives. Sophomores and juniors typically have priority in registering for advanced honors seminars; seniors may register if space permits. general Information Freshman and advanced honors seminars are offered in both the fall and spring terms, although most FS offer- ings are in the fall and most AHS offerings are in the spring. Seminars are capped at 16 to 18 students. The students from two freshman seminars are grouped together into an advising \"cohort\" of 32 to 36 students, who meet as a group with their CAS adviser several times during the freshman year. The selection of seminars changes from year to year. Students may find the most up-to-date offerings and descriptions at cas.nyu.edu/page/honorsprograms. College of Arts and Science Seminars The College of Arts and Science is one of the most diverse communities anywhere\u2014an exciting, sophisti-cated center in one of the most dynamic and cosmopolitan cities in the world. Our mission is to prepare students to be thought leaders and successful global citizens. We do this by creating unique academic opportunities for student and faculty engagement that emphasize research and scholarly communication. The College's freshman seminars (required of all first-year students) and advanced honors seminars (electives for sophomores, juniors, and\u2014if space permits\u2014seniors) place students in small classes with first-rate instructors to study topics that have the potential to change how we think and how we work. As such, they are ideal gateways for the intellectually stimulating discussions we aim to foster. They challenge students and faculty to engage intensively within and beyond their fields of study, and they inspire intel-lectual responsibility toward the scholarly community and the wider world. Program23 CAS SEMINARS C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYCOLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCE SEMINARS This is a sampling of recent seminars in the program. Except where noted, the seminars do not assume any specific course or background on the student's part. Language and Reality in 20th-Century Science and Literature FRSEM-UA 210 Ulfers. 4 points. Explores the possibility that there exists a common ground between the two cultures of science and the humanities and posits the hypothesis of a correla-tion between postclassical science (e.g., quantum theory) and \"postmodern\" literature and philosophy. Among the key notions examined are Heisenberg's \"uncertainty principle\" and the \"undecidability\" of deconstructive theory. The discussion of these notions and of their implications in literary works revolves around their effect on classical logic, the referential function of language, and the traditional goal of a complete explanation/description of reality. Readings include selections from literature and from non-technical texts on quantum and chaos theory. The Supreme Court and the Religion Clauses: Religion and State in America FRSEM-UA 218 Sexton. 4 points. Should members of the Native American church be allowed to smoke peyote at religious ceremonies? Can a public high school invite a rabbi to give a benediction and convocation at graduation? Should a state legislator rely on his or her religious convic-tions in forming a view about the legality of capital punishment or abortion? We divide these questions into three subject areas: religious liberty, separation of church and state, and the role of religion in public and political life. Focuses on how the Supreme Court has dealt with these areas and invites students to construct a new vision of the proper relationship among religion, state, and society in a 21st-century liberal constitutional democracy. First Amendment Freedom of Expression FRSEM-UA 235 Solomon. 4 points. Conflicts over freedom of speech erupt into public debate almost every week. A tobacco company sues a major television network for libel. Press disclosures threaten the fair-trial rights of criminal defendants. Although the First Amendment appears on its face to prohibit any governmental restrictions on speech, the Supreme Court in fact balances free and open expres-sion against other vital interests of society. We begin by examining the struggle against seditious libel (the crime of criticizing government or its officials) that was not won in this country until the landmark decision in New York Times v. Sullivan in 1964. We then examine such contemporary conflicts as political dissent that advocates overthrow of the government, prior restraints against publication, flag burning, obscenity and pornography, indecency in online services, and hate speech. Students read and analyze important decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court. School and Society: NYU in the Sixties and Seventies FRSEM-UA 255 T annenbaum. 4 points. The 1960s and 1970s brought profound changes in American society, changes mirrored in the history of the nation, academe, and New York University. It was a time that witnessed the struggle for civil rights, assassinations, war abroad and riots at home, and a youth-led revolution in music, dress, and values. Aims to develop an appreciation of those years by examining the events and the reactions as they affected campuses and students across America. Students prepare reports on different aspects of the era. In addition, through shared background reading, class members work on group projects. In both cases, and in the spirit of the times, the topics are self-chosen with the approval of the group and the seminar leader. Disease in History: Epidemics and Pandemics from Antiquity to the Present FRSEM-UA 265 Hull. 4 points. Focuses on the historical dimensions of several major epidemics that profoundly affected human societies in Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Americas. Students identify each epidemic and explore its causes, origins, means of transmission, efforts at contain- ment, and impacts on societies, particularly on their cultural development. They examine representations of the epidemic in the arts, media, and literature of the period, as well as assess the effects of each disease on demographics, religions, economies, and lifestyles. To what extent did an epidemic, or plague, accelerate or retard fundamental changes in human relationships within societies and between them, and the ways people viewed themselves and their universe? Literary Theory and Its Applications FRSEM-UA 355 Maynard. 4 points. Students read a selection of essays from major thinkers about literature, mainly from the latter half of the 20th century, to learn to consider different approaches to literature. Their final project discusses a work of literature using one or more of the freShmaN SemINarS24 CAS SEMINARS C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYCOLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCE SEMINARS conceptual approaches they have studied. Emphasis is placed on learning how to analyze theoretical problems and improvise in applying them to new situations. Recommended for students interested in any area of the humanities. The Art and Architecture of Papal Rome 1490- 1610: T wo Michelangelos\u2014Buonarroti and Merisi da Caravaggio FRSEM-UA 366 Walton. 4 points. Biographies and films about the lives of Michelangelo Buonarroti and Caravaggio provide the starting point for studying the lives and works of these wonderful artists and the remarkable papal patronage that made much of their work possible. The culture of Renaissance and Counter Reformation Rome and the history, art, and religion of this papal capital are examined and discussed in class, while masterpieces of painting and sculpture by the two artists provide the subjects for extensive student research and writing. The Writer in New York FRSEM-UA 367 Passaro. 4 points. Taking on the many images and expressions of the writer in New York over the past century and more, we approach the city as a kind of super-literary event, a vivid aesthetic and social organism that enlarges and tunes the artistic imagination and the writer's crucial powers of observation. We read pri-mary sources and secondary commentary to examine how a number of writers have negotiated\u2014and how the city has powerfully influenced\u2014the fragile construction of their literary art and their personal identities. Through the readings\u2014from Whitman to James, from Crane to Millay to Fitzgerald, from the Beats to the Downtown writers to recent web post- ings\u2014we strive to understand the New York writer's particular forms of misery and joy. Welcome to College: The Novel FRSEM-UA 371 Sternhell. 4 points. Starting college can be exhilarating\u2014and terrifying. A chance for intellectual enlightenment\u2014or intense loneliness. An escape from a stultifying small town of narrow-minded people\u2014or a riot of alcohol, sex, and drugs. We read a selection of college novels from different historical periods, ranging from F . Scott Fitzgerald's This Side of Paradise (about life at Princeton just before World War I) to Tom Wolfe's I Am Charlotte Simmons (about the corruption of a brilliant and innocent country girl at a contempo-rary Ivy League university). We discuss these novels from a variety of perspectives: literary, historical, and journalistic. In addition to presenting reports on the readings, students write about their own experiences as first-year students at NYU in several genres, including fiction and nonfiction. The Doctor's Dilemma: Being Both Correct and Right FRSEM-UA 379 Makover. 4 points. Dr. Saul Farber, former Dean of the NYU School of Medicine, frequently cautioned that an action or a conclusion might be correct, but would it be right? Ethics, laws, and religious and cultural beliefs intersect in every medical encounter and healthcare issue and affect patients' options and care. Issues to be studied and debated include: Should doctors help terminal patients die to relieve intractable suffering? Should doctors participate in executions or in the interrogation of terrorists? Do we want to know so much about our genetic makeup that we are faced with terribly difficult consequences of that knowl- edge? Who should pay for your healthcare? Students submit weekly essays and a long final paper. Suffering and Comfort: Explorations in Narrative Medicine and Other Sources FRSEM-UA 393 Shedlin. 4 points. Scientific advances create heretofore unimaginable opportunities, choices, and dilemmas for all of us as we try to cope with disease, human suffering, and the psychological consequences that are inevitable when illness and care needs create complexity in our lives. We focus on readings in narrative medicine and other sources, including film, newspaper and magazine articles, novels, poetry, and religious texts, and discuss the different ways individuals and cultures view these important dimensions of the human experience. Familiarizes students with the conceptual frameworks used by nurses, physicians, social workers, and clergy as they assist patients. America's Role in International Affairs since World War II FRSEM-UA 405 Sitrick. 4 points. To provide historical perspective, we first read George F . Kennan's classic book American Diplomacy, 1900-1950. Subsequent topics include the creation of the UN during the late 1940s and some of its more recent activities, including possible reform; the activities of the CIA; the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962; American involvement in Vietnam in the 1960s and early 1970s; America's long involve-ment in the Middle East, including its more than 25 CAS SEMINARS C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYCOLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCE SEMINARS sixty-year support for the State of Israel and the alleged influence of the \"Israel Lobby\" on U.S. for- eign policy; the current U.S. relationship with Iran; how the U.S. may have inflamed the insurgency in Iraq during the first few years of the war; the impe- rial presidency (comparing Arthur Schlesinger Jr.'s celebrated 1973 book on the subject with the actions of the Bush 43 administration); and the foreign policy challenges of the Obama administration. Branding: People, Places, Things FRSEM-UA 422 Lewis. 4 points. Brands can be magical, prosaic, living, or dead. And while companies manicure them it's up to us, the audience, to determine if they are successful. They live, breathe, grow, and sometimes (deservedly) die. Brands use a variety of rational and emotional tools to connect with us. Even the brand owners sometimes don't really know what the glue is that cements the relationships with their audiences. We analyze what makes brands tick: how they're created, and how time, technology, distribution, competitors, and consumers force them to change. We examine how branding has impacted politics and presidents. Finally, poses the question, how are we perceived? How do we create, change, and live up to our own brands? A marketing course for the rest of us. Wiseguys, Spies, and Private Eyes: Heroes and Villains in American Culture, Film, and Literature FRSEM-UA 449 Friedfeld. 4 points. Explores the ways in which specific American archetypes and themes are perceived and articu-lated\u2014from the rugged Old West individualist, to the persevering underdog who becomes a boxing champ, to the evolving perceptions of government, to the Cold War-era uncertainty that spawned a generation of literary and celluloid superspies. Examines representations of heroes and villains in modern American popular culture and how great films and novels in three particular genres\u2014detec- tive, gangster, spy\u2014influenced our understanding of these archetypes. Moves from the early influences of Hamlet and Macbeth to Sherlock Holmes, Raymond Chandler's Philip Marlowe, Mario Puzo's (and Francis Ford Coppola's) The Godfather, James Bond, and Batman. What is College For? FRSEM-UA 474 Jordan. 4 points. Why did you decide to attend college? To broaden your intellectual horizons and become a more open-minded person? To gain specialized knowledge in a specific subject? To achieve a more successful and financially rewarding career? To satisfy your parents? Or perhaps some combination of these reasons? We examine historical and contemporary discussions about the personal and societal goals of higher edu-cation. At the beginning of the twenty-first century, current models and practices of higher education are receiving increased scrutiny. Topics for discussion: Does higher education need to redefine its academic mission? Should everyone attend college? What is the impact of new technologies? How can students, professors, and administrators all contribute to creating a successful college environment? Gender, Sexuality, and the Law FRSEM-UA 480 Fischel. 4 points. In the family, the impact of sex/gender law is felt in marriage, divorce, and family planning. In the workplace, the Civil Rights Act and its progeny have broadened opportunities for women, but not unequivocally. Similarly, Title IX has contained discriminatory practices in education, but courts have checked its substantive reach. Criminal law treats crimes associated with sexuality, rape, domestic abuse, and prostitution in unique and perhaps troubling ways. Finally, in all these spheres, gender identity and sexual orientation have a complicated relationship to sex. Analyzes contemporary doctrinal, judicial, and legislative developments. The Cultural Nature of Language FRSEM-UA 496 Schieffelin. 4 points. Accents, pronouns, swearing, and spelling: how one uses language is never value-free. We examine language-using as a social practice and analyze how speakers and their language(s) are evaluated and regulated across a range of contexts and cultures. We look at popular attitudes toward language and the practices by which people regulate its use in the media (e.g., political correctness), in legal and educational institutions (e.g., \"English Only\"), and in multilingual cities (e.g., Barcelona, Montreal) in order to understand how ideas about language are often tied to issues of inclusion and exclusion. Critically explores issues of identity and authority. The New Worlds of Work and Care FRSEM-UA 500 Gerson. 4 points. The early 21st century represents a period of immense social change in both the public world of work and the private world of caring for others. New technologies have blurred the boundary between home and work. New economic opportunities and pressures have sent women into the workplace. The rise of the \"new economy\" has created jobs 26 COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCE SEMINARS CAS SEMINARS C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYwith more short-term flexibility, but less long-term security. And new options in intimate relationships have created more diverse and voluntary, but less predictable, family patterns. What are the major dilemmas created by these changes, and how are people coping with these dilemmas? And what can we do to enhance the opportunities and limit the insecurities of these new social arrangements? In Search of Lost Time FRSEM-UA 503 Clements. 4 points. We will read Proust (in translation) as he should be read: hedonistically\u2014with respect and admiration but also with delectation. A prodigious novel of more than 4,000 pages, In Search of Lost Time is one of modern literature's most challenging reads. Often said to be the first modern fiction, In Search of Lost Time is still unparalleled in how it combines finesse and wit with raw emotion, self-examination with social history, profound psychological acuity with a dazzling portrait of the French beau monde at the outset of modernity, and how it merges an audacious explosion of literary form with explora-tions of memory, desire, attachment, deception, lust, jealousy, ambition, and disappointment. The novel's vast, thrilling architecture cannot be understood until it has been read once in its entirety. We move at a brisk pace through the entire work (reading assignments average 350 pages per week). Into the Urban Wild: Nature Writing and the City FRSEM-UA 522 Parmiter. 4 points. We examine both the idea and the manifestation of little wildernesses in New York City, questioning the assumptions and the rhetoric we use when talking about the existence, construction, representation, cultivation, or manipulation of nature in our urban environment. We immerse ourselves in classics of American nature writing and then venture into the city, using our texts as lenses for reading such spaces as Central Park, the High Line, the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, and the American Natural History Museum. Left Brain, Right Brain, Whole Brain: Acts of Knowledge, Discovery, and Creation FRSEM-UA 531 Ellis. 4 points. In theory, \"left brains\"\u2014the analytical, logical, objective among us\u2014become engineers, biologists, and bankers, while \"right brains\"\u2014 intuitive, thoughtful, subjective\u2014are the painters, philosophers, and social workers of the world. In practice, in the science lab or in the artist's studio, these distinctions may be more porous than we pop- ularly believe. Draws on many disciplines to explore the interplay between reasoning, knowledge, belief, discovery, and creativity\u2014acts of mind common to all fields in the academy. We work towards the goal of \"understanding our understanding,\" as the artist Matthew Goulish phrases it, in order to exploit the twinned powers of rationality and creativity. Race and Culture in Brazil FRSEM-UA 536 Robbins. 4 points. Whether as an example of presumably more egalitar- ian race relations, or as a regional culture embodying an exceptional fusion of African, Indigenous, and European elements, Brazil is a model for under- standing heterogeneity and difference. And yet it is also a nation frequently cited for its incidence of violence and extreme economic inequality. We trace the history of race relations in the ongoing transformation of Brazilian culture, examining such key examples and events as slavery and the planta-tion economy, popular music, Carnival, populism, racial democracy, affirmative action, and urban and rural violence. Uses textual, musical, and cinematic sources. Facing Fascism: The Spanish Civil War and U.S. Culture FRSEM-UA 539 Prerequisites: AP credit in Spanish and in U.S. history. Fern\u00e1ndez. 4 points. The West is in the grip of the Great Depression, and liberal democracy is in crisis. On the rise: a spectrum of ideologies ranging from anarchism to fascism. July 1936: a right-wing military coup attempts to overthrow a democratically elected left-wing coali- tion government, and all eyes turn toward Spain. We focus on NYU's Abraham Lincoln Brigade Archives (ALBA), a vast collection of materials that chronicles the lives of the 2,800 Americans who, between 1936 and 1939, volunteered to fight fascism in Spain. We explore the place occupied by Spain and the Spanish Civil War in American culture from the 1930s forward and how journalists, writers, artists, and citizens reacted to the war in Spain. Each student completes a major research project based on the holdings of ALBA.27 COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCE SEMINARS CAS SEMINARS C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYadvaNced hoNorS SemINarSThis is a sampling of recent seminars in the program. Except where noted, the seminars do not assume any specific course or background on the student's part. The History of Disbelief AHSEM-UA 113 Stephens. 4 points. Takes up an extended history of atheism and doubt (in the context of a history of religion). Begins in Greece and then moves on to a brief discussion of anthropological perspectives on belief, before returning to Greece, to the Hebrews and Rome, to India and Baghdad, and then back to Europe during the Renaissance, the Scientific Revolution, the Enlightenment, and the romantic period. Time is spent in England and America in the 19th century, when disbelief was being tied to radical politics, before moving on to the connection between disbe- lief and realism, modernism and postmodernism. Metapatterns from Quarks to Culture AHSEM-UA 154 Cross-listed with Environmental Studies as ENVST-UA 254; counts toward the major in environmental studies. Volk. 4 points. Metapatterns are structural/functional patterns in systems, which occur across the levels of the universe as it built in a series of steps of \"combigenesis\" from quarks to culture (about 12 main-path steps, including the emergence of atoms, simplest cells, animal societies, agriculture, the state). Examining these steps, we explore themes such as binaries, borders, centers, alphabetic holarchies, complexity theory, networks, and positive and negative feed- backs. Topics for student projects may include the environment, music, language, biological or cultural evolution, or levels in politics. Political Cinema and Representation of the \"Other\" AHSEM-UA 170 Dotan. 4 points. In contemporary war, the \"other\" is viewed not only as an enemy to be fought but, often, as one to be eliminated. How do filmmakers fight against or, alternatively, reinforce, such deadly representations? We focus primarily on one of the world's most conflict-ridden regions\u2014the Middle East\u2014but also explore films from Soviet Russia, Nazi Germany, France and the United States. Examines how the \"other\" is constructed politically, aesthetically, and ethically. Designed for anyone interested in film- making and film criticism, in contemporary politics and history, especially those of the Middle East, in cinema of conflict and violence, and the ethical questions associated with them. The Spanish Inquisition AHSEM-UA 173 Identical to SPAN-UA 952. Dopico-Black. 4 points. The Spanish Inquisition has been used as shorthand to denote intolerance, persecution, fanaticism, and cruelty. While some elements of this reputation are well-earned, the history of the Inquisition is far more complex and interesting. We consider the origins of the Inquisition and its key role in nation building, as well as the various targets of inquisitorial suspicion or persecution from the late 15th through late 17th centuries (such as Jews, Protestants, Muslims, witches, and heretics). Readings include transcripts from Inquisitorial trials, edicts and proclamations, historical chronicles, novels, plays, an Inquisitor's manual, and a witch-hunting treatise. We also examine more contemporary reflections, such as the film adaptation of J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. Civil Rights and Civil Wrongs: The Fight for Equality in the United States AHSEM-UA 183 Identical to HIST-UA 830. Does not satisfy the advanced research seminar requirement for the history major. Baar. 4 points. When African-American men were given the vote through the 15th Amendment, the abolitionists felt their work was done. It would take another 50 years before women would be granted the right to vote. Because the fight for human rights does not exist in a vacuum, we examine the intersection of the three major American movements for African-American rights, women's rights, and gay rights, looking back over 160 years of history. We also consider how events in the United States and around the world informed and changed the dialogue on civil rights as so many fight even today to keep the conversation alive. 28 AFRICANA S TUDIES C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYmajor The Africana studies major comprises introductory, elective, and research components, which together make up a total of eleven 4-point courses (44 points), as listed below.

The curriculum comprises interdisciplinary and cross-cultural teaching and research in the histories, cultures, economies, politics, and languages and cultural practices of Africans in Africa, the Americas (North and South), the Caribbean, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and the Middle East. The program is administered from within the Department of Social and Cultural Analysis, and it maintains close relationships with community programming and research activities at NYU's Institute of African American Affairs and Africa House. Africana studies offers programs leading to B.A., B.A./M.A., and M.A. degrees, as well as a suite of joint M.A. programs with journalism, economics, and museum studies.director of a fricana Studies Associate Professor Blake www.africanastudies.as.nyu.edu 20 Cooper Square, 4th Floor New York, NY 10003-7112 MAJOR/MINOR IN Africana Studies29 AFRICANA S TUDIES ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYMAJOR/MINOR IN AFRICANA S TUDIES A note about language/linguistic competency: The type of rigorous intercultural study promoted within the Department of Social and Cultural Analysis requires students to recognize the complex modes of communica- tion at work both within and across different social groups. Studying the modern incarnation of these languages also reveals the cross-cultural and historical forces that have shaped them. The department therefore strongly encourages its students to develop advanced skills in Swahili, T wi, Yoruba, and/or any of the indigenous languages spoken in Africa, or creole languages (e.g., Haitian Creole) spoken throughout the African Diaspora. This can be achieved by any of the following means: taking elective courses in sociolinguistics; studying these languages beyond the minimum level required by the College of Arts and Science; pursuing community-based internship fieldwork necessitating the development and use of specific language skills; or undertaking study or research abroad, especially at the NYU Accra site, in contexts entailing the exercise of key language or linguistic capabilities. minor Five 4-point courses (20 points) are required for the minor in Africana studies. Students must take one of the following introductory courses: Approaches to Africana Studies (SCA-UA 101; offered periodically), or Cultures and Contexts: Africa (CORE-UA 505; offered every year), or Cultures and Contexts: The African Diaspora (CORE-UA 532; offered every year), or Cultures and Contexts: The Black Atlantic (CORE-UA 534; offered every year), plus four designated Africana studies elective courses. One Africana language course can count as an elective if taught by SCA faculty. honors Program Majors who have completed 48 points of graded work in CAS and have a 3.65 GPA or higher (both overall and in the major) are encouraged to register for Senior Honors Seminar (SCA-UA 92) in the fall semester of their senior year. Upon successful completion of the seminar requirements, students will be eligible to register for Senior Honors Thesis (SCA-UA 93) in the spring. Information about the honors program can be found at sca. as.nyu.edu/object/sca.related.honors. coUrSeS Introductory core Concepts in Social and Cultural Analysis SCA-UA 1 4 points. A gateway to all majors offered by the Department of Social and Cultural Analysis. Focuses on the core concepts that intersect the constituent programs of SCA: Africana studies, American studies, Asian/ Pacific/American studies, gender and sexuality stud-ies, Latino studies, and metropolitan studies. Surveys basic approaches to a range of significant analytical concepts (for example, property, work, technology, nature, popular culture, consumption, knowledge), each considered within a two-week unit. Approaches to Africana Studies SCA-UA 101 Cultures and Contexts: Africa (CORE-UA 505) or Cultures and Contexts: The African Diaspora (CORE-UA 532) or Cultures and Contexts: The Black Atlantic (CORE-UA 534) can substitute for this course. SCA-UA 101 is offered periodically; the Core courses are offered every year. 4 points. Introduces students to a variety of topics and meth- odologies associated with Africana studies as a field of academic inquiry, including the history of the field and its growth over the course of time. Specific topics may include the question of African retention in the Americas, the comparative study of slavery, the concept of creolization, an understanding of the black Atlantic, and the meaning of diasporic studies, as well as the use of history, sociology, linguistics, anthropology, literature, music, and the arts as ways in which the experiences of black peoples have been documented and transmitted. research core Strategies in Social and Cultural Analysis SCA-UA 20 Offered every year. 4 points. Introduces an array of social scientific research methods, both qualitative and quantitative. Topics range from ethnography to survey research to social statistics. Includes practical, hands-on application of the research methods.

Introduces students to the tools of cultural criti-cism and theory, with particular emphasis on black culture, urban environment, and black people's relationships to a variety of social and cultural institutions and practices. The latter may include the mass media, class and poverty, the police, urban development, education, music, art, and sports. The Black Essay SCA-UA 152 4 points. Examines the urban experience and black life and culture in New York through a series of writing assignments on African American neighborhoods, institutions, issues, and culture. Students are required to travel throughout the black community, conduct interviews, and do research for essays on the black experience in the city. They are introduced to the research and reporting techniques of journalism and given the chance to employ these techniques in their papers. The Black Body and the Lens SCA-UA 155 4 points. Explores the range of ideas and methods used by crit- ical thinkers in addressing the body in photography, video, music, and film. Central to our discussions is a focus on how the display of the black body affects how we see and interpret the world. Using a series of case studies, we consider the construction of beauty, gendered images, race, and hip-hop culture. The historical gaze has profoundly determined the visual construction of the black body in contemporary society. The interplay between the historical and the contemporary, between self-presentation and imposed representation, is fundamental to our discussions. The seminar centers the student within the contemporary world of image making with an emphasis on the black body. Final projects include an imaging project and/or a written essay. Black Feminism SCA-UA 156 4 points. Explores the production and practice of black feminist theory in 20th-century America. We examine the written work and the activism of African American women and look at the way that theory and practice historically intersect around questions of race and gender. Because this is a course 31 AFRICANA S TUDIES C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYMAJOR/MINOR IN AFRICANA S TUDIES on feminism, we also spend a good deal of time interrogating power and thinking about the ways in which systems of oppression both produce and block a black feminist consciousness. Hip Hop & Politics SCA-UA 157 4 points. In places ranging from the political theory of Adolph Reed to the comedy of Bill Cosby we find a critique of the \"hip hop generation\" so dismissive it might be a useful point of departure for further historical and theoretical inquiry. Besides realizing the worst fears of a previous generation who placed its hopes in the aspirations of 60s-era social movements, this new generation's fashion sensibilities, technological savvy, and strategies for commodifying blackness suggest a demographic now more concerned with the economics of globalization than the political economy of race. This course mixes a diverse set of readings with music and film to interrogate the specific generational tensions that structure popular and intellectual discourses concerning the \"hip-hop generation\" and the perceived demise of contempo-rary black politics. Race and Reproduction SCA-UA 158 4 points. Examines the connections between gender, racial ideology and history of medicine to consider the range of ways that reproduction\u2014medically, cultur-ally, and experientially\u2014produces and troubles racial ideology. In this course we will explore issues in the history of race and reproduction, focusing primarily (though not exclusively) on North American con- texts. Cross-cultural breadth will help us to consider the relationship between biological experiences (which are often portrayed as universal) and socio- cultural context. While questions about biology will be central to this history, we will also locate biology within a wider set of issues around social reproduc- tion and the practices of motherhood. Through our readings we will consider how different disciplinary orientations (social history, medical anthropology, feminist theory, art history, etc.) help us to illumi- nate and problematize the connections between technologies and politics of biology and difference. Language and Liberation: At Home in the Caribbean and Abroad SCA-UA 163 Identical to LING-UA 26. 4 points. Explores the linguistic and cultural transformations that took place in the Commonwealth Caribbean from 17th-century slavery and bond servitude to the present day. The focus is on the extent to which Caribbean people were given or demanded the freedom to create and maintain a postcolonial Caribbean identity. Discusses the sociohistorical conditions that led to the creation of new Caribbean languages called \"pidgins\" and \"creoles\" as the English language was transplanted from Britain to the Third World. The Postcolonial City SCA-UA 166 4 points. Cities have played an important role throughout African history and in various Afrodiasporic contexts: from the metropolises of ancient Egypt and the urban centers of well-known West African civili- zations (such as Ghana, Mali, and Songhai) to cities such as Port-au-Prince, Havana, and Georgetown in the Caribbean and the urban enclaves in the United States. In attending to the way actors constitute wealth and power\u2014in accounting for the way prox- imity structures interpersonal experiences\u2014we use ethnographic, sociological, historical, and literary texts to theorize the Afrodiasporic city. We explore the contours of these urban matrices through special attention to historical categories that prepare us to theorize the way Afrodiasporic populations have experienced and lived history (e.g., the precolonial, the colonial, and the postcolonial). As part of our mission, we consider the historical emergence of the Third World as not simply a broad rubric for African and Asian postcolonies, but instead, a project to reverse the course of European exploita-tion. Instead of proceeding strictly chronologically, students consider the Afrodiasporic urban experience thematically, through a diverse array of readings. T opics in Africana Studies SCA-UA 180 4 points. Explores specific issues dealing with the black urban experience, focusing on social and cultural institu- tions. Possible themes, which vary from semester to semester, include class and poverty, the police, urban development, education, sports, music, and art. T opics in Pan-Africanism SCA-UA 181 4 points. Deals with specific themes of Pan-Africanism and their impact on the modern world. Possible themes, which vary from semester to semester, include African unity, black rebellion, colonialism and racism, the African diaspora and culture, and rela- tionships between Pan-Africanism and movements such as nationalism, Marxism, and Afrocentricity.MAJOR/MINOR IN AFRICANA S TUDIES language c ourses Elementary Swahili I SCA-UA 121 4 points. Provides students with an elementary understanding of Swahili, a Bantu language with a rich oral and written tradition that is spoken by about 100 million people from Somalia to Mozambique and Zanzibar. After a short presentation of Swahili's history, codi- fication, and relation to other languages, students are drilled in phonetics and grammar. They are also introduced to poems, songs, and oral narratives. Elementary Swahili II SCA-UA 122 Prerequisite: Elementary Swahili I (SCA-UA 121) or permission of the instructor. 4 points. Expands on the basic knowledge of the pronuncia- tion, vocabulary, useful expressions, and fundamental grammatical features acquired in Swahili I. Allows essential communication skills to develop into conversational ability using simple and familiar situ-ations. Building on the early grasp of the language, students expand the range of conversational ability and understanding of various grammatical concepts associated with this agglutinative language. Intermediate Swahili I SCA-UA 123 Prerequisite: Elementary Swahili II (SCA-UA 122) or permission of the instructor. 4 points. Builds on the basic knowledge of the pronunciation, vocabulary, useful expressions, and fundamental grammatical features already attained at the intro- ductory level. Aims to strengthen reading, writing, and conversation skills by accessing a wide range of grammatical and literary knowledge of the language, its cultural context, and literary genre. Students are required to familiarize themselves with a novel and a play written in Kiswahili. Intermediate Swahili II SCA-UA 124 Prerequisite: Intermediate Swahili I (SCA-UA 123) or permission of the instructor. Offered every year. 4 points. Aims to enable students to communicate entirely in Kiswahili, to carry out bidirectional translation from Swahili to English and from English to Swahili, and to negotiate technical language. At this level, students would master the intricacies of Kiswahili grammar; acquire a wide range of Kiswahili fluently; understand Kiswahili poetry, idioms, and proverbs; and use idiomatic Kiswahili in creative writing and translation.related courses The following courses count as electives for Africana studies majors and minors.

The Center's teaching and research functions emphasize consid- erations such as the design of governing institutions, the development and distribution of human capital, and the means by which fundamental policy issues can be resolved or advanced through the promotion of efficient and effective solutions that are sensitive to political, economic, and social realities. The Center offers a number of undergraduate courses in political economy, in addition to a certificate program. certificate The Alexander Hamilton Center Certificate is a unique credential that demonstrates highly developed skills in political economy analysis. Students interested in careers and/or graduate study in policy will benefit from the rigorous training in analytical methodology provided by the certificate course work. Applications to the certificate program are rolling, although students typically apply in the spring of their junior year. (They may apply earlier if they have fulfilled the requirements.) The Center welcomes applica- tions from students of all majors. To be considered for admission to the program, students should have an overall GPA of at least 3.3. Students with lower GPAs will be considered if they have a strong recommen- dation from a faculty member affiliated with the Center. The prerequisites for admission are Quantitative Methods for Political Science (POL-UA 800), a course in microeconomics, and at least one Hamilton seminar. The certificate program consists of four Hamilton seminars, in addition to POL-UA 800. Hamilton seminars taken prior to starting the program will count toward the certificate requirements. Students must earn at least a B in each of the seminars and participate in the Alexander Hamilton Center Junior Researchers Conference in May of their senior year. (Note that only one internship may be counted toward the certificate.) Upon graduation from the College (September, January, or May), students are awarded one of two certifi- cates: the Gold Hamilton Certificate is awarded to students who graduate with at least a 3.7 GPA, and the Silver Hamilton Certificate is awarded to those who graduate with a GPA between 3.3 and 3.7.

The adviser for the minor is responsible for ensuring that each student's pro- gram of study remains coherent and logical, although there is considerable flexibility within the bounds of the requirements. Courses may be selected that deal with different periods and methodological approaches, as well as a variety of geographical areas that the requirements demand. Each student's course of study is designed on an individual basis, in accordance with his or her needs and interests. A number of CAS departments and programs, as well as institutes and centers, are directly involved in this program: anthropology, art history, classics, comparative literature, East Asian studies, English, Hebrew and Judaic studies, history, Irish studies, linguistics, Middle Eastern and Islamic studies, and the Alexander S. Onassis Program in Hellenic Studies. The minor consists of five 4-point courses, which are normally selected from the appropriate offerings of these departments and programs. All five of the courses selected must be offered by departments other than the student's major department, and no more than two may be taken in any one department. Students are furthermore expected to examine at least three different civilizations or cultures in completing this minor. Language courses may not be used to fulfill the requirements of this minor. If desired, students who choose this minor may complete, as a capstone experience, an independent study course, which is normally the fifth course taken for the minor. The adviser for the ancient studies minor may assist students in designing a project and in finding an appropriate faculty member to direct this independent study.adviser Clinical Associate Professor Roth (Art History/Hebrew and Judaic Studies)PROGRAM IN Ancient Studies41 ANIMAL S TUDIES C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYminor To complete a minor in animal studies, students must receive a grade of C (2.0) or better in four of the follow- ing 4-point courses (16 points): Animals and Society (ANST-UA 200/ENVST-UA 610/ SOC-UA 970) Animals in Art and Literature (ANST-UA 300) Ethics & Animals (ANST-UA 400) Animal Minds (ANST-UA 410) Food, Animals, and the Environment (ANST-UA 440/ENVST-UA 440) Animals and Public Policy (ANST-UA 500/ENVST-UA 630) Topics in Animal Studies (ANST-UA 600) Primate Behavior and Ecology (ANTH-UA 54) Comparative Biology of Living Primates (ANTH-UA 56) Prehistoric Art and Symbolic Evolution (ANTH-UA 212) Texts and Ideas: Topics\u2014Animal Humans (CORE-UA 400) Topics in Performance Studies: Animal Rites (DRLIT-UA 301) Animals, People, and Those in Between (ITPG-UT 2746) The Performing Animal (OART-UT 408) Performing Beyond the Human: Ecology, Animality, and Performance (THEA-UT 801) Introduction to Topics in Literary Theory: The Animal T urn (ENGL-GA 1957) To declare a minor in animal studies, contact the adviser for animal studies at animal.studies.advising@nyu.edu.ProgramfacUl TYcollegiate Professor; Professor of english and drama Chaudhuri (Environmental Studies/ Philosophy/Law)assistant Professor Jerolmack clinical assistantProfessor Jacquet (Environmental Studies)NYU's Animal Studies Initiative promotes and supports research and teaching in the emerging area of animal studies.

Explores the myriad and contradictory positions that animals occupy in society (e.g., as pets, pests, mascots, and food) and deconstructs the social origins of these seemingly natural categories. Takes a grounded look at what actually happens when humans and animals interact, 42 ANIMAL S TUDIES C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYMINOR IN ANIMAL S TUDIES which sheds new light on the nature of human and animal consciousness and troubles some of the assumptions we make about the necessary role of language and symbols in interaction. Fundamentally, students learn how the roles that animals take on in our lives, and the ways that we think about and relate to them, are inherently social processes that are patterned by geography, culture, class, gender, and so on. Central questions include: How do ideas about, and relationships to, animals vary across time and space? What roles do science, literature, and media representations play in shaping how we think about animals? How and why did pets become honorary members of the American family? Why are some animals, but not others, granted moral status and legal protection in society? How do humans and animals coordinate interaction without language? Animals in Art and Literature ANST-UA 300 Chaudhuri. 4 points. The anthropologist Claude Levi-Strauss said that animals featured so prominently in myth and ritual \"not because they are 'good to eat' but because they are 'good to think.'\" The history of art and literature suggests that they are also good to paint, to sculpt, to photograph, to film, and to write about. This course uses methodologies and perspectives offered by the emerging field of animal studies to explore how artists use the figure of the animal and the subject of animality in their work. Studies a range of contemporary representations of animals\u2014in fiction, poetry, film, and the visual arts\u2014with a view to understanding how the contemporary cultural imagination configures the ethics, politics, and aesthetics of the relationship between humans and other animals. Ethics & Animals ANST-UA 400 4 points. Examines the morality of our treatment of nonhu- man animals, beginning with the nature of moral rights and duties. What are rights, and where do they come from? How do we resolve conflicts among rights? Do animals have rights? Next, what are obligations, and where do they come from? What makes right actions right? Do we have special obligations to members of our own family, nation, or species? Is there a moral difference between killing and letting die? Do we have group obligations as well as individual obligations? We ask how these issues apply to our treatment of nonhuman animals. Are we justified in treating animals as property under the law? Are we justified in using animals for food, clothing, entertainment, research, or com- panionship? Finally, what are the ethics of animal advocacy? Here we consider abolition vs. regulation, incrementalism vs. absolutism, and legal reform vs. direct action. Animal Minds ANST-UA 410 4 points. How do animals experience the world, and how is their experience similar to and different from ours? We need to be able to answer this question for many practical and theoretical purposes, but there seem to be serious limits to our ability to answer it, for reasons that are partly scientific and partly philo- sophical. This course aims to examine the nature and limits of our understanding of animal minds from a primarily philosophical perspective. We begin with a survey of philosophy of mind and cognitive ethol- ogy. What is a mind, and who or what can have one? How can we learn about animal minds, and what are the main research methods that scientists use to study them? We then ask what, as far as we know, animal minds are like. How do animals perceive the world? Do they have memories? Self-awareness? Language? Rationality? Finally, the course considers the philosophical implications of answers to these questions. What, if anything, do they tell us about animal welfare, animal agency, and animal person- hood? And more generally, what can we learn from all this about the human/nonhuman divide, and about the nature, value, and meaning of human life? Food, Animals, and the Environment ANST-UA 440 Identical to ENVST-UA 440. Offered every spring. Schlottmann. 4 points. Students study human interaction with both food and animals and the environmental impacts and ethi- cal issues that arise from such interaction. Focuses on the moral standing of animals, animals as food, and the environmental impacts of agriculture, transporta- tion, and consumption. Surveys major thinkers in the field, including Michael Pollan, Peter Singer, Jim Mason, Wendell Berry, David Foster Wallace, Jonathan Safran Foer, and Martha Nussbaum. Students engage in collaborative research projects, with possible field trips to local agricultural sites. Animals and Public Policy ANST-UA 500 Identical to ENVST-UA 630. Offered every fall. Wolfson. 4 points. Provides an overview of public policy with respect to the somewhat contradictory treatment of animals by humans, with a focus on how public policy is 43 MINOR IN ANIMAL S TUDIES ANIMAL S TUDIES C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYcreated and how social change occurs. We consider what public policy consists of and what actors and factors play a role in the creation of public policy; how society views animals; the capacities of animals; how ethics relates to animal treatment; how animals are currently utilized by our society; and political and other efforts to improve or alter the current treatment of animals, including the influence of sci- ence, government, business and non-governmental organizations in defining and influencing animal-related policies. We focus on legislation, litigation, regulation, and ballot initiative and consumer campaigns and their effectiveness, as well as other strategies that relate to improving animal welfare. We also discuss the meaning of \"animal rights\" and the success and impact of the modern animal protec-tion movement.

Sociocultural anthropology is interdisciplinary in orientation, analyzing and synthesizing religious, artistic, economic, and political practices through the common medium of culture. T raditionally, cultural anthropology emphasized the study of small-scale societies (often termed \"exotic,\" indigenous, and/or nonliterate peoples). Contemporary sociocultural anthropology maintains such interests but increasingly applies its insights and methods to complex, urban, and industrialized societies and attends more closely to the production of culture. An emphasis of the department is the ethnographic study of cultural, social, and political processes that shape our lives and those of other people, especially as we are drawn together and influence one another in increasingly transnational and global interactions. Linguistic anthropology focuses on how language is interpreted and used in cultural contexts.

The department considers its greatest assets to be the various individual areas of faculty expertise: archaeological specialties such as medieval archaeology and European, Near Eastern, and South Asian prehistory; biological anthropol- ogy areas such as molecular primatology, primate behavioral ecology, and paleoanthropology; linguistic anthropology foci such as discourse analysis and language socialization; and sociocultural anthropology specialties such as the ethnography of North America, Africa, India, China, the Near and Middle East, the Caribbean, Latin America, Europe, Australia, and the South Pacific. Major theoretical emphasis is on the systems of thought and symbolic representation of the self and society; the relation between female and male domains of interaction; changing patterns of social organization and hierarchy within small-scale societies, urban settings, and bureaucratic institutions; medical anthropology; evolutionary approaches to the study of primate and human origins; religion; art; science studies; race and ethnicity; and the problem of ethnographic representation in film and other media. Departmental resources include an extensive film and video collection as well as teaching and research labs for archaeology, linguistic anthropology, and biological anthropology, which can be used for research by advanced undergraduates. A departmental colloquium series and an undergraduate student association welcome undergraduate participation. Formal and informal cooperative arrangements with museums, zoos, and other academic institutions in the greater New York area place at students' disposal a group of anthropological scholars, materials, and resources unparalleled in this country.45 DEPARTMENT OF ANTHROPOLOGY ANTHROPOLOGY C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYrealities.

Archaeological anthropology uses artifacts and other material remains to understand human culture. It attempts to breathe life into a material record that at first glance appears static and fragmentary. The research interests of anthropological archaeologists range from the earliest production of durable tools 2.6 million years ago to the refuse currently being generated by modern cities. All aspects of past human existence, including art, technology, religion, gender, economic and social organization, and food-getting strategies, are addressed by researchers in anthropological archaeology. Biological anthropology encompasses the study of human and nonhuman primate biological diversity and includes the anatomy, genetics, behavior, ecology, and evolution of humans and other primates. It is linked to the other subfields of anthropology by its commitment to the study of human biology, behavior, and evolution within the context of culture, society, and ecology. Close ties with the American Museum of Natural History and the Wildlife Conservation Society International at the Bronx Zoo facilitate the department's diverse research interests in biological anthropology. The department participates in the University's Hagop Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies, the Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies, the Center for Religion and Media, the Center for the Study of Human Origins, the Institute for Study of the Ancient World, the Program in Museum Studies, the Program in Culture and Media, and the Center for Media, Culture, and History. departmental objectives Anthropology courses contribute to undergraduate education in two ways. First, the scope of the discipline's interests effectively bridges the humanities, the social sciences, and the natural sciences. Anthropology asks basic questions concerning the origins and development of humans and their cultures and divergent systems of thought, belief, and social order. By systematically analyzing various cultural traditions\u2014contemporary as well as historically known\u2014anthropology raises critical questions concerning the bases of both world civilizations. An understanding of the distinctive way anthropology formulates and attempts to answer its basic questions is a necessary component of a comprehensive liberal education. Second, the department offers concentrated programs of study for the minor, major, or honors student. A minor usually emphasizes one of the four subdisciplines, although students are free to select courses from across the sub-fields. For the major, the department encourages study in all of the subdisciplines, because each supplements and complements the others in presenting humans as both biological and social beings. The honors program includes in-depth research and writing in one aspect of sociocultural, linguistic, archaeological, or biological anthropology, as well as the pursuit of additional advanced course work at the senior undergraduate or graduate level. The director of undergraduate studies (DUS) works closely with anthropology majors and minors in designing programs of study that integrate their individual goals with the offerings and intellectual goals of the department and complementary disciplines. Majors should meet with the DUS at least once per semester, typically just prior to registration for the next semester, to discuss their progress through the program, decide on future course work, and discuss post-graduation plans. The department prides itself on its graduate and undergraduate programs' integrated nature, which enables major, minor, and honors students to participate in a variety of challenging graduate courses and seminars. Additionally, an active Anthropology Undergraduate Student Association (AUSA) connects students to one another through events and an e-mail forum.46 DEPARTMENT OF ANTHROPOLOGY ANTHROPOLOGY C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYmajor The major in anthropology consists of nine 4-point courses (36 points), which include the following four required courses (16 points): Human Society and Culture (ANTH-UA 1) Human Evolution (ANTH-UA 2) Archaeology: Early Societies and Cultures (ANTH-UA 3) Anthropology of Language (ANTH-UA 17; offered only in the spring semester) The remaining elective courses for the major (five courses/20 points) may be selected from any subfield of anthropology. Students must take at least five courses from the Department of Anthropology at New York University in order to receive a major in anthropology from NYU, and a grade of at least C is required in every course to be counted toward the major. Students are not required to focus on any one of the subfields of anthropology represented in the department, but rather are free to choose elective courses that accommodate their interests as narrowly or broadly as they see fit, in consultation with the DUS. Internships approved by the DUS are encouraged, but internship credits may not be applied toward the major. Independent study courses, conducted under the supervision of a departmental faculty member, are also encouraged and can be applied toward the major. Majors should consult regularly with the DUS in order to take full advantage of the seminars and research opportunities open to them. Joint Majors with Classics and Linguistics In collaboration with the Department of Classics and the Department of Linguistics, the Department of Anthropology also offers two joint majors. Joint majors consist of 20 points (five 4-point courses) in anthropol-ogy and 20 points in the joint department. A grade of at least C is required in every course to be counted toward the joint major. Joint majors should consult regularly with the DUS in anthropology and the DUS in the joint department in order to take full advantage of the seminars and research opportunities open to them.

One anthropology course, Human Society and Culture (ANTH-UA 1), is required, along with four other anthropology electives chosen in consultation with the DUS of each department. T wenty points are required in classics. See classics section in this Bulletin for additional information. Joint anthropology-classics majors should also consult with Professor Rita Wright in the Department of Anthropology and the DUS in the Department of Classics for aid in developing their program of study. Joint major with the Department of Linguistics: The joint major in anthropology and linguistics emphasizes the complementary nature of anthropological and sociolinguistic approaches to language. Students are required to take five 4-point courses (20 points) each from the Department of Anthropology and the Department of Linguistics, and a grade of at least C is required in every course to be counted toward the joint major. Required courses in anthropology are Human Society and Culture (ANTH-UA 1), Anthropology of Language (ANTH-UA 17), either Cultural Symbols (ANTH-UA 48) or Language, Power, and Identity (ANTH-UA 16), and two other cultural or linguistic anthropology courses approved by the Department of Anthropology's DUS.

The fifth course in linguistics may be an additional course from the above list or another course that the depart-ment offers, chosen in consultation with the DUS in the Department of Linguistics. See linguistics section in this Bulletin for additional information. Joint anthropology-linguistics majors should also consult with Professor Bambi Schieffelin in the Department of Anthropology and Professor John Singler in the Department of Linguistics for aid in developing their program of study.DEPARTMENT OF ANTHROPOLOGY 47 ANTHROPOLOGY C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYGlobal Public Health/Anthropology Major The College of Arts and Science (CAS) and the Department of Anthropology offer students the opportunity to pursue a major that combines anthropology and global public health. Students pursuing this combined program will complete core and elective courses in both areas. The major provides interdisciplinary training that embraces the natural convergence of society, culture and health, and draws on the Department of Anthropology's strength in bridging the social sciences, natural sciences, and humanities. A major in global public health/anthropology prepares students to analyze various cultural traditions through the lens of health; to examine complex relationships within economic, political, cultural, physical, and biological environments; and to apply anthropological approaches to public health problems. The major is designed to prepare students for multidisciplinary careers in a variety of settings and/or for advanced academic training in public health, anthropology or other related fields. Students in this combined major are strongly advised to talk to an advisor in the Department of Anthropology to work out a course plan. The following are the fifteen courses (60 points) required for the major: Global public health requirements (seven courses/28 points): Health and Society in a Global Context (UGPH-GU 10) Biostatistics (UGPH-GU 20) Epidemiology (UGPH-GU 30) Health Policy (UGPH-GU 40) Environmental Health (UGPH-GU 50) GPH Internship (UGPH-GU 60) One semester of advanced foreign language (above intermediate II level) One semester of study away Anthropology core courses (three courses/12 points): Human Society and Culture (ANTH-UA 1) Medical Anthropology (ANTH-UA 35) Global Biocultures (ANTH-UA 320) Anthropology elective courses (three courses/12 points), chosen from: Human Evolution (ANTH-UA 2) Health & Disease in Human Evolution (ANTH-UA 55) Emerging Diseases (ANTH-UA 80) Human Ecology (ANTH-UA 90) Anthropology of Gender and Sexuality (ANTH-UA 112) Race, Difference, and Social Inequality (ANTH-UA 323) Introduction to Forensic Anthropology (ANTH-UA 326) Human Rights and Culture (ANTH-UA 331) Culture through Food (ANTH-UA 410) Major electives (two courses/8 points): T wo additional electives must be completed in the GPH program or anthropology, by advisement. For descriptions of GPH (UGPH-GU) courses, please see the global public health section of this Bulletin. minor The minor in anthropology consists of 16 points (any four 4-point courses) in the department. The \"principles\" courses Human Society and Culture (ANTH-UA 1), Human Evolution (ANTH-UA 2), and Archaeology: Early Societies and Cultures (ANTH-UA 3) are recommended as overviews of the discipline and as prerequisites for more advanced courses. Minors consult with the DUS to design a program that best accommodates their interests. A grade of at least C is required in every course to be counted toward the minor. Students must take at least two courses from the Department of Anthropology at New York University in order to receive a minor in anthropology from NYU.48 DEPARTMENT OF ANTHROPOLOGY ANTHROPOLOGY C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYhonors Program A degree in anthropology is awarded with honors to selected majors who apply for admission to the program through the DUS during their junior year.

Candidates for the honors program must complete a total of ten 4-point courses (40 points) in anthropology, including the two-semester research/thesis writing sequence, Honors Research I (ANTH-UA 950) and Honors Research II (ANTH-UA 951) taken in the senior year, plus at least one Special Seminar in Anthropology (ANTH-UA 800 or ANTH-UA 801) or a graduate course, typically taken in the junior or senior year. All of these courses count toward the major. In the fall semester of the senior year, all thesis writers from across departmental subdisciplines enroll in Honors Research I (ANTH-UA 950), a seminar course in which research methods are taught and individualized to fit each student's topic\u2014e.g., assembling a bibliography; constructing hypotheses; using secondary, primary, and occasionally original sources to generate data; and analyzing data. In the spring semester, all thesis writers enroll in Honors Research II (ANTH-UA 951), a seminar course in which students share their developing theses with the group. Honors candidates are strongly encouraged to formally present posters/papers at the Dean's Undergraduate Research Conference and within the department. Feedback will be offered at different stages by both faculty and student peers in the seminar. In both semesters, it is the responsibility of the thesis writer to consult with his or her departmental faculty mentor who is supervising the honors project and who will serve as the primary thesis reader.

Race, \"Difference,\" and Social Inequality ANTH-UA 323 Identical to SCA-UA 323. Prerequisite: Human Society and Culture (ANTH-UA 1) or permission of the instructor. Khan. 4 points. Human beings have always grappled with some notion of identity, asking questions about who they are, about who others distinguished from themselves are, and about the ways that perceived similarities and differences are meaningful and important (or not) in social relationships. Examines how historical, social, and cultural contexts shape the forms that identities take, looking in particular at ideas about race and racial identity. We work with two premises: (1) race must be understood in relation to other identity categories: gender, class, sexuality, ethnicity, and so on, and (2) race is expressed in both obvious and subtle ways; thus, racial identity is implicit as well as explicitly expressed. We also consider whether race must necessarily be understood as stigma; discuss nonfiction, fiction, and films; and may visit public exhibitions.

Also examines the forms of intervention that have been developed in the United States and globally for diminishing violence against women, including policing, prosecution, and punishment. Human Rights and Culture ANTH-UA 331 Prerequisite: Human Society and Culture (ANTH-UA 1) or permission of the instructor. Merry. 4 points. Offers an overview of the human rights system, looking at its basic elements and studying how it works. Focuses on the relationships between human rights and culture. Human rights campaigns frequently encounter resistance in the name of protecting cultural differences. This is particularly common with issues concerning women, children, and the family. Explores several issues that raise questions of human rights and culture, such as female genital cutting, honor killing, trafficking of persons, and indigenous peoples' rights to culture. Using these examples, considers how the human rights system deals with tensions between global standards and local ways of life. Examines the mean- ings of rights and of culture in these debates and shows the implications of adopting an anthropologi-cal analysis of these situations.

Drawing on ethnographic 55 DEPARTMENT OF ANTHROPOLOGY ANTHROPOLOGY C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYmaterial from a wide range of cultures, as well as fea- ture films and our own observations and interviews, we consider topics such as the material dimensions of food production, distribution, and consumption (e.g., how food scarcity or abundance shapes collec- tive possibilities, expectations, and values; the causes, consequences, forms, and myths of globalization) and the cultural meanings and social distinctions encoded in food practices (e.g., how food is used cross-culturally as a marker of social identity\u2014class, gender, and ethnicity\u2014and as a source of mean- ing\u2014nostalgia, anxiety, and so on). Formations of Indigeneity ANTH-UA 605 Formerly ANTH-UA 320. Prerequisite: Human Society and Culture (ANTH-UA 1) or equivalent. Offered every other year. 4 points. Through a case study of materials concerning indigenous people in Australia and North America, investigates the consequences (cultural, sociologi- cal, policy) of a development that has taken place throughout the world. Many of the peoples in whom anthropologists are interested\u2014those organized into small-scale, kinship-based societies\u2014are encapsu- lated as indigenous minorities within nation states dominated by other cultural traditions. Examines how the capacity and practices of these peoples, who some have characterized as \"Fourth World peoples,\" to reproduce themselves and their traditions on their own terms has been limited, undermined, co-opted and, on occasion, ironically reinforced.

Barbarian Europe ANTH-UA 217 Prerequisite: Archaeology: Early Societies and Cultures (ANTH-UA 3) or permission of the instructor. Crabtree. 4 points. Between the end of the Ice Age and the expansion of the Roman Empire, temperate Europe witnessed a series of social and economic transformations that represented a transition from a hunting and gather-ing way of life to urban chiefdoms. Along the way, these hunter-gatherers became agriculturalists and stockherders, learned to use metals, and developed social structures as complex as any found in Old World civilizations. Examines changes in later prehistoric Europe from about 8000 B.C.E. to the arrival of the Romans.African Archaeology ANTH-UA 218 Prerequisite: Archaeology: Early Societies and Cultures (ANTH-UA 3). 4 points. With the longest record of human occupation in the world and a landmass that represents more than one-fifth the habitable area of the globe, Africa plays a central role in our understanding of human evolution, the prehistory of our species, and the development of complex societies. Explores the expe- riences of ancient human populations in Africa using evidence drawn from archaeology as well as history, ethnography, linguistics, art history, geography, geology, paleontology, biology, and other disciplines. Focuses not only on the material evidence from across the continent and its interpretation, but also an understanding of the major questions, developing methods of inquiry and problem solving, and situat- ing the African data in the broader context of the archaeological evidence for the evolution of human behavioral diversity. The scope of the course spans hominin origins, the study of Stone Age foragers of the first 2.5 million years of human prehistory, and more recent periods characterized by food produc- tion, metallurgy, sedentism, and the development of complex societies (e.g., in Egypt, Mali, Zimbabwe, and the East African coast) with influence and contacts across and outside the continent. Discovering Archaeology in New York City ANTH-UA 225 Wright. 4 points. When based on archaeological remains from 10,000 years ago to the beginning of the 20th century, a different perspective on the city in time and space can emerge. Walking around its various boroughs, students learn that our modern landscape is vastly different from that of earlier eras. Along with our gains as a major cultural center, we assess some losses brought about by the destruction of aspects of the city's past. In particular, students consider the meaning of stewardship in the context of urban development.

There are two majors within the department. In the art history program, students at the introductory level examine works of art and architecture and learn the critical and historical bases for understanding and analyzing them. At the advanced level, majors and non-majors investigate style, iconog-raphy, patronage, social and political contexts, and other aspects of the arts in more specific geographical areas and periods. This advanced work, along with foreign language study, provides a solid foundation for those who plan to attend graduate school to prepare for careers in areas such as scholarship, teaching, museums, writing, and the art market. The urban design and architecture studies program offers an interdisciplinary analytic approach to these subjects. The program provides a broad humanistic perspective on cities' physical aspects, as well as pre-professional training for future architects, city planners, public administrators, and writers on urban problems. An internationally renowned faculty and a diverse group of students use the Grey Art Library and Study Center, which includes lecture and seminar rooms, offices, a reference library, computers, and study space.DEPARTMENT OF Art History60 ART HISTORY C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF ART HISTORY One 4-point advanced course in Renaissance or baroque art chosen from the following: ARTH-UA 301- 309, ARTH-UA 316, and ARTH-UA 350 One 4-point advanced course in modern art chosen from the following: At least one 4-point course in non-Western art 560, and ARTH-UA 570 One Advanced Seminar (ARTH-UA 800) to be taken during the junior or senior year. Students must have completed four art history courses before enrolling in an advanced seminar. T wo electives chosen from any courses other than those listed under the \"survey requirement\" above, either offered by the department or any approved course offered in another department or through an NYU Study Away site. Other proposed substitutions must be discussed with the director of undergraduate studies prior to election of the course in question. Major in classics and art history: For details of this interdepartmental major, refer to the description under classics in this Bulletin. With prior departmental approval, students can count two courses from any single NYU Study Away site toward this major and may count a total of three courses from more than one site. Urban d esign and a rchitecture Studies m ajor The requirement for the major is nine 4-point courses (36 points). Students work with the director to achieve career-oriented goals within the major. Course work includes the following: Survey requirement (two courses/8 points). Students take both: History of Architecture from Antiquity to the Present (ARTH-UA 601) Shaping the Urban Environment (ARTH-UA 661) A combination of core courses and cross-referenced courses, chosen from the following: ARTH-UA 104, ARTH-UA ARTH-UA one seminar chosen from ARTH-UA 670-679, ARTH-UA 681 minor in a rt history or Urban d esign and a rchitecture Studies The requirements are any four 4-point courses (16 points) in art history or urban design and architecture studies that do not overlap in material. The student may not receive credit for both History of Western Art I (ARTH-UA 1) and Ancient Art (ARTH-UA 3) or Medieval Art (ARTH-UA 4); or both History of Western Art II (ARTH-UA 2) and Renaissance and Baroque Art (ARTH-UA 5) or Modern Art (ARTH-UA 6), as their contents overlap. Introductory courses are prerequisites for advanced-level courses. Advanced-level courses are those that carry prerequisites, namely, courses listed above as satisfying the survey requirement for the art history major. Urban design and architecture studies minors may take four 4-point courses from URDS offerings. Note: Art history courses taken in the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development may not be double-counted for credit toward an art history minor. However, for Steinhardt students taking a minor in art history, the two-semester Steinhardt survey Art and Contemporary Culture is the prerequisite for advanced Renaissance, baroque, and modern courses. Art and Contemporary Culture II may only serve as the prerequisite for advanced modern courses. Studio a rt minor For many majors in art history and urban design and architecture studies, understanding the field can be enhanced by the experience of making art. It is valuable for these majors to be exposed to the materials and methods of the visual arts, to obtain information about technical processes, and to gain a direct hands-on appreciation of problems of form and meaning as they are approached and solved by artists. This minor is also of practical value for art history or urban design and architecture studies majors planning careers in museology, conservation, architecture, city planning, and landmark preservation.61 ART HISTORY C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF ART HISTORY The studio art minor requires 16 points chosen from courses offered by the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development, as summarized below. (Note: Courses at the 1000 level are only open to juniors and seniors.) Required core courses (12 points) include one introductory course each in drawing, painting, or print (4 points); sculpture or ceramics (4 points); and media (4 points). For an elective (4 points), select any introduc- tory course in the areas listed above that has not been used to satisfy a core requirement.

The independent study must also be approved by the director of undergraduate studies. Please request an independent study form from the departmental office in Silver Center, Room 303. graduation with h onors Students may graduate with departmental honors in art history or in urban design and architecture studies by successfully researching and writing a senior thesis. This represents the culmination of the work for the major and provides excellent preparation for graduate school. To be eligible for the honors program, students must have a GPA of 3.65 or higher at the conclusion of the junior year, both overall and in art history or in urban design and architecture studies. A student wishing to write an honors thesis must apply for admission to the program via the department NYU Classes site in early March of the junior year. For a complete description of all the honors thesis requirements, please visit our departmental NYU Classes site for honors-track students. Work toward the senior thesis consists of two 4-point honors courses (ARTH-UA 801 and ARTH-UA 804) focusing on research methods and writing, accompanied by regular meetings with the supervising professor. The completed thesis, at least 40 pages in length, is read by a committee of three faculty members, including the supervising professor. The committee meets with the student for a thesis defense at the end of the academic year. Satisfactory completion of the thesis, in the committee's judgment, earns an honors degree. These two honors courses may replace the two electives required for the major.62 ART HISTORY C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF ART HISTORY art history Survey c ourses No previous study is required for admission to the following courses (ARTH-UA 1 through 6).

The Enlightenment shaped the visual arts in two seemingly antithetical ways. On the one hand, the period's valorization of cool rationalism contributed to the rise of neoclassicism as a dominant style during the 18th century. The other course of Enlightenment thinking, exemplified by the writings of J. J. Rousseau, celebrated emotion as the purest form of intellectual as well as spiritual expression. Romanticism, with its emphasis on subjectivity and intense emotionalism, is as much a product 69 ART HISTORY C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF ART HISTORY of the Enlightenment as neoclassicism. Following on the heels of romanticism, realism has been alternately described as a rejection of romanticism and as an extension of it. Focusing on these three stylistic movements, examines how late 18th- and early 19th-century artists negotiated not just the aesthetic ideas of the Enlightenment but its political consequences as well.

Beginning by considering how impressionism refined and redirected the artistic aims of 19th-century real-ism, follows the development of progressive art to the brink of cubism and pure abstraction in the first years of the 20th century. Following impressionism and post-impressionism, close attention is paid to symbolism, aestheticism, art nouveau, the Arts and Crafts movement, fauvism, and expressionism. The aesthetic aims of these movements are analyzed in tandem with the social and cultural conditions that generated them.

The dada movement in the period during and after World War I is examined as a reaction to the apparent bankruptcy, cultural and artistic, of Western civilization. However, this nihil- istic impulse is followed by a \"return to order\" in the 1920s. Then examines the tensions in the multiple currents of surrealism: metamorphic, academic, and abject. Painting after World War II, from Pollock to Dubuffet, is analyzed as an extension and transfor-mation of prewar trends.

One of six programs in the Department of Social and Cultural Analysis (SCA), it provides an interdisciplinary approach to understanding the history and contemporary experiences of Asian/Pacific Americans in the Americas. The category of Asian/Pacific American includes people of East Asia, South Asia, Central Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Islands living in the United States, as well as in other parts of the Americas. The two main areas of concentration are urban studies and diaspora studies. Urban studies examines the formation of Asian/Pacific American communities in relation to the various cultural, social, and political institutions in urban settings, with special emphasis on the New York metropolitan area. Diaspora studies investigates the processes that enable Asian/Pacific American communities in the United States and the Americas to sustain ties with communities throughout the world. The analysis of cultural produc- tion\u2014social, political, and economical processes\u2014is a central theme, as is cross-cultural conflict and collaboration.

Included is a variety of genres (poetry, plays, fiction and nonfiction, literary/cultural criticism, and nontraditional forms) by writers from diverse ethnic backgrounds. Explores the ways in which the writers treat issues such as racial and ethnic identity, immigration and assimilation, gender, class, sexuality, nationalism, culture and community, history and memory, and art and political engagement. History and Literatures of the South Asian Diaspora SCA-UA 313 Identical to ENGL-UA 721, HIST-UA 326. Offered every year. 4 points. Introduction to the history of the South Asian diaspora in the United States. Highlights work on South Asian immigrant communities in the United States and the little-known history of South Asian immigrants on the east coast of the United States in the context of historical migration to the United States, Canada, and the Caribbean. Offers a multidisciplinary perspective and uses classic as well as new works on South Asians in the United States from history, anthropology, sociology, and cultural studies. Asian/Pacific/American Popular Culture SCA-UA 320 4 points. Examines the ways in which Asian/Pacific Americans have constituted and positioned their identities through various mediums of popular culture from the 1930s to the present. In particular, emphasizes popular institutions of representation, including music, theatre, fashion, television, and film, to examine the complex relationship between Asian/ Pacific American representational practices and their material experiences in sociopolitical locations. In addition, considers the multiple and differentiated interpretive strategies of Asian American consumers of popular culture. How are Asian/Pacific American consumption and reception practices constituted differently across lines of class, gender, and sexuality?80 ASIAN/P ACIFIC/ AMERICAN S TUDIES C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYMAJOR/MINOR IN A SIAN/P ACIFIC/ AMERICAN S TUDIES Filming Asian America: Documenting Community SCA-UA 361 4 points. Focuses specifically on the Asian American com-munities of New York and their histories. Presents filmmaking as a mode of community documenta- tion and filmmakers as historians. Students meet as theorists and field researchers. The first phase is largely historical and theoretical, while the latter mainly deals with hands-on filmmaking. Students document various aspects of Asian/Pacific American communities in New York\u2014sociocultural and political issues surrounding them, histories, personal stories, geodynamics of ethnic localities, domestic lives, professions, ethnic festivals and performances, etc. At the end of the course, students have made at least two collective documentaries (10 to 12 minutes each), which may be interrelated or on entirely different subjects. Multiethnic New York SCA-UA 363 4 points. As a global city, New York is one of the most ethnically and culturally diverse places in the world. In particular, the growth of migrant populations from Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean is driving the transformation of New York's economic, social, and political landscape. Explores the global socioeconomic conditions that facilitate and sustain these migrations and examines the cultural practices, imaginaries, and strategies of migrants as they become part of the city. Asian Americans & War SCA-UA 365 4 points. Examines Asian American history and contemporary culture using the theme of \"war\" as an organizing principle. It considers not only the sociopolitical effects of actual war\u2014between Asian nations, between the United States and Asian nations, and civil wars in Asia\u2014on immigration to the United States, but also the myriad meanings of war and their social and cultural implications for Asian Americans. It examines the ways in which wars have transformed Asian American social organization and influenced shifting alliances, multiple sense of belonging, and racial representations in the United States during World War II and Vietnam as well as the metaphorical presence of war in everyday life.The Constitution and People of Color SCA-UA 366 Offered every year. 4 points. Examines how the American legal system decided constitutional challenges affecting the empowerment of African, Latino, and Asian American communi- ties from the 19th century to the present. Topics include the denial of citizenship and naturalization to slaves and immigrants, government-sanctioned segregation, the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II, the prison industry, police brutality, post-9/11 detention issues, and voting rights. Course requirements include attendance at a community function involving constitutional issues, a midterm, and an interactive oral and written final project comparing a present-day issue affecting racial minorities in New York City and proposing measures to collectively address the issue. Reading Race and Representation SCA-UA 368 4 points. Much contemporary public discourse characterizes race as a problem that some individuals \"have,\" or, even, a \"card\" that some people \"play.\" It is rarely recognized as a structural or material dimension that comprises everyday experience and knowledge. We ask what it means to \"read\" race in objects, spaces, and events that for the most part do not seem to be \"about\" race per se. Addresses a series of such topics, which we consider from an interdisciplinary perspec-tive, engaging historical and legal texts, literature, and film, as well as scholarship from anthropology, sociology, and history. Over the course of the semester, we address concepts and themes related to U.S. ethnic studies and critical race theory, including citizenship, rights, segregation, whiteness, colonial-ism, labor, migration, and alienness. \"Chinatown\" and the American Imagination SCA-UA 370 Identical to IDSEM-UG 1229. 4 points. What is a \"Chinatown\"? The word alone evokes many images, sounds, smells, and tastes from many different sensibilities. For recent immigrants, it can be a home away from home; for \"outsiders,\" an exotic place for cheap eats; for male action-flick fans, Chow Yun-Fat (or Mark Wahlberg) in The Corruptor; and for you? (Fill in the blank.) We explore the nooks and crannies of Chinatown in the American imagination and in its New York real- time, non-virtual existence. How do we know what we know and do not know? What does Chinatown have to do with the formation of normative 81 ASIAN/P ACIFIC/ AMERICAN S TUDIES C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYMAJOR/MINOR IN A SIAN/P ACIFIC/ AMERICAN S TUDIES \"American\" identities? What are the possibilities (and limits) of crossing cultural divides? Class members individually and/or in groups research, experience, and document a chain of persons, places, and/or events, creating their own narrative \"tour\" of this place's meanings. Novels, history books, tourist guides, films, and pop culture supplement the primary \"text\" of New York's Chinatown. This is a collaborative, discussion-intensive, field-research- driven class. The Immigrant Imagination SCA-UA 371 4 points. Examines contemporary immigration through the lens of visual culture. Explores a variety of expressive forms produced by migrant subjects\u2014including film, photography, art, and fashion\u2014and considers how these work to narrate the experiences of travel and displacement; home and exile; leisure and labor. In doing so, students consider how these visual representations seek to express the conditions of contemporary immigration in ways that co-exist with and counter dominant depictions. We ask: How do visual practices\u2014from filmmaking to graffitiing\u2014operate within immigrant communities as a mode of story-telling or world-making? How have immigrants employed visual culture to narrate their cross-cultural movements, community-building efforts, political struggles, and cultural memories? T opics in A/P/A Studies SCA-UA 380 Offered every semester. 4 points. Specific topics vary from semester to semester. Former topics have included \"Yellow Peril\": Documenting and Understanding Xenophobia; T ransnational Feminism; Cultural Politics of Food; and Politics of Fashion in the Asian Diaspora. language c ourses Elementary Filipino I, II SCA-UA 321, 322 Offered every year. 4 points per term.

The major in biology is an integrated yet diverse program that builds a solid foundation in modern biology through course- work in molecular biology, cell biology, evolution, genetics, developmental biology, physiology, immunology, genomics, systems biology, computational biology, ecology, and environmental biology. From the very outset 84 BIOLOGY C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF BIOLOGY of their studies, students are exposed to modern concepts and state-of-the-art experimental and analytical methods. Upper-level courses emphasize foundational knowledge as well as laboratory skills, reasoning skills and quantitative skills. Advanced students may register for graduate-level courses, which are most often given in the specialized areas of faculty research. The department also offers a set of discrete minors in the life sciences, specifically in the areas of molecular and cell biology, genetics, genomics and bioinformatics, and environmental biology. Each minor is designed to hone skills in a particular contemporary area of biology and requires a laboratory experience. The minors permit students to create a course of study that will meet their unique academic and career goals. This program provides outstanding preparation for careers in research, academia, medicine, dentistry, and related fields. Graduates of the department have a remarkable record of success in acceptance into professional schools and in establishing notable careers in the biomedical sciences. Other courses offered by the department are designed to acquaint non-science majors with contemporary issues in biology. Such courses are often topical, addressing problems such as environmental pollution, limits of the earth, and human physiology. Outstanding and highly motivated students are offered special opportunities for honors work, independent study, summer laboratory research, internships, and other enhancements. Upper-level students may become involved in research projects in faculty laboratories through the many formal and informal opportunities afforded by the department. The department has a tradition of important research accomplishment and contains several specialized research and laboratory facilities that are integrated into the educational programs. These include undergraduate labs in molecular biology, cell biology, experimental physiology, genomics, bioinformat-ics, and ecological analysis. Field studies are carried out at a variety of regional sites. Department faculty are also affiliated with the NYU Center for Genomics and Systems Biology, the NYU Center for Developmental Genetics, NYU Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, the NYU School of Medicine, the NYU College of Dentistry, the American Museum of Natural History, the New York Botanical Garden, and Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. Students with questions about majoring in biology or minoring in a specific area of biology should visit the office of the Department of Biology. Those declaring a major in biology are assigned a faculty adviser from the department; students meet with that professor to design a program of study, determine course selections, and discuss career goals. The faculty adviser is also available to provide guidance concerning the many options and opportunities afforded by the department for curricular enhancement, including research experiences. major (Bachelor of a rts) The department offers two tracks. The standard biology track provides the major with a broad background in biology with the laboratory, quantitative, and reasoning skills needed for today's modern biology. The ecology track also provides students with a broad background in modern biology, but with a focus on ecological concepts, approaches, and analytical methods. In addition to these two tracks, students may pursue a major in global public health/science, with a concentra- tion in biology (see below). In each of the two tracks, sixteen courses (typically 70 points) completed with grades of C or higher (and a minimum GPA of 2.0 for all courses required by and taken as electives in the major) are required for the major. To permit the maximal choice of appropriate upper-level courses, we strongly recommend that students take Principles of Biology I and II (BIOL-UA 11, 12), General Chemistry I and II and Laboratories (CHEM-UA 125, 126), and mathematics in their freshman year. Then as sophomores, students in the standard track should take Molecular and Cell Biology I, II (BIOL-UA 21, 22), whereas students in the ecology track should take Molecular and Cell Biology I (BIOL-UA 21) and Fundamentals of Ecology (BIOL-UA 63). Programs of majors must be approved each term by a department adviser.85 BIOLOGY C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF BIOLOGY Biology Standard Track Biology core courses (four courses/16 points): Principles of Biology I and II (BIOL-UA 11, 12) NOTE: Biology majors are not required to register for the 1-credit Principles of Biology Lab (BIOL-UA 123).

If there are overlapping requirements with a major or another minor (as indicated below), students will need to take one or more additional courses. No more than two of the required courses for the business studies minor may also be used to satisfy requirements for a major or another minor. caS courses Introduction to Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 1; formerly Economic Principles I, 4 points) Introduction to Microeconomics (ECON-UA 2; formerly Economic Principles II, 4 points) Note on the economics requirement: Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, etc. credit in macroeco-nomics and/or microeconomics is not accepted toward the business minor. Students can either 1. take Introduction to Macroeconomics and Introduction to Microeconomics and forfeit their AP/IB/etc. credit, or 2. take the second-year courses Intermediate Microeconomics (ECON-UA 10) and Intermediate Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 12). The prerequisites for the intermediate-level courses (found in the economics section of this Bulletin) are strictly enforced. Calculus chosen from the following four options: Mathematics for Economics I (MATH-UA 211; 4 points) Calculus I (MATH-UA 121; 4 points) AP (or equivalent international) credit in calculus Calculus II (Polytechnic Institute of NYU, MA 1124; 4 points) Statistics chosen from the following four options (CAS students are advised to take their statistics credits in the College. Advanced Placement or equivalent international credit is not accepted): Statistics (ECON-UA 18; prerequisite: MATH-UA 121 or MATH-UA 211, 4 points); students not majoring in the economics policy track must also take Regression and Forecasting Models (ECON-UA 19; identical to STAT-UB 3, prerequisite: ECON-UA 18 2 Statistics (ECON-UA 20; prerequisite: MATH-UA 122 or MATH-UA 212, 4 points). This course is intended for students majoring in the economics theory track. A student who takes ECON-UA 20 but is not majoring in this track must also take Regression and Forecasting Models (ECON-UA 19; identical to STAT-UB 3, prerequisite: ECON-UA 18 or STAT-UB 1, 2 points) Statistics for Business Control (Stern, STAT-UB 1; prerequisite: MATH-UA 121, 4 points); students must also take Regression and Forecasting Models (Stern, STAT-UB 3; identical to ECON-UA 19, prerequisite: ECON-UA 18 or STAT-UB 1, 2 points)Program aNd coUrSeSA broad liberal arts education, which includes a general education component (the College Core Curriculum) and a major in a liberal arts discipline or interdisciplinary field, provides a solid foundation for many careers in business. The skills and perspectives of the liberal arts are practical as well as personally enriching. Liberal arts students can enhance their preparedness for business by also completing a small number of relevant courses. In consultation with the Undergraduate College of the Leonard N. Stern School of Business, the College of Arts and Science has identified a set of such courses, some offered by CAS and some offered by Stern. By completing the business studies minor, students acquire the core knowledge and quantitative skills that are invaluable assets for success in the business professions. Intended especially for students interested in the humanities, the minor in business studies is administered by the College of Arts and Science and is available to all students in the University. Students considering the minor should consult with the business studies adviser in the College Preprofessional Advising Office in the Silver Center, 100 Washington Square East, Room 901; 212-998-8160; cas.business@nyu.edu. www.business.cas.nyu.edu Silver Center 100 Washington Square East, Room 901, New York, NY 10003-6688 212-998-8160 MINOR IN Business Studies100 BUSINESS S TUDIES C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYMINOR IN BUSINESS S TUDIES Statistics for Business Control and Regression and Forecasting Models (Stern, STAT-UB 103; prerequisite: MATH-UA 121, 6 points). Notes on the statistics requirement: Students pursuing both the business minor and the policy track in the economics major will cover regression analysis in the required major course Topics in Econometrics (ECON-UA 380); therefore, they are not required to take an additional 2-point course in regression and forecasting for the Business minor. In addition, students pursuing both the business minor and the theory track in the economics major will cover regres- sion analysis in the required major course Introduction to Econometrics (ECON-UA 266); therefore, they are also not required to take an additional 2-point course in regression and forecasting for the business minor. However, economics majors who wish to take Foundations of Finance (FINC-UB 2) and/or Operations Management (OPMG-UB 1) for the business minor (see below) should note that these two courses have as their prerequisite a course in regression and forecasting. Therefore, they may only be taken after Topics in Econometrics or Introduction to Econometrics. Economics majors may, if they wish, take the 2-point regression course ECON-UA 19. This is not required for the economics major, but it allows economics students to take FINC-UB 2 and/or OPMG-UB 1 earlier in their undergraduate careers. Stern core courses Required of all minors: Principles of Financial Accounting (ACCT-UB 1; 4 points) One of the following core courses: Management and Organizations (MGMT-UB 1; 4 points) or Introduction to Marketing (MKTG-UB 1; 4 points) or Information Technology in Business and Society (INFO-UB 1; 4 points) or Operations Management (OPMG-UB 1; prerequisites: completion of the statistics requirement and a course in regression and forecasting, 4 points). Stern Additional Electives Students registered for the business studies minor must complete a minimum of six courses (at least four through CAS and two through Stern), unless there are overlapping requirements with a major or other minor. No more than two of the required courses for the business studies minor may also be used to satisfy requirements for a major or other minor. As a general rule, a student must take four non-overlapping courses to complete the business studies minor. (For example, Economics policy majors are required to take ECON-UA 1, 2, and 18 for both their major and this minor; with this overlap of three courses, they are therefore required to take one extra course from the list below, for a total of three courses in Stern.) Managerial Accounting ACCT-UB 4 Prerequisite: Principles of Financial Accounting (ACCT-UB 1). 4 points. Foundations of Finance FINC-UB 2 Prerequisites: Introduction to Microeconomics (ECON-UA 2) and statistics plus a course in regression and forecasting; corequisite: Principles of Financial Accounting (ACCT-UB 1). 4 points. Information T echnology in Business and Society INFO-UB 1 4 points. Management and Organizations MGMT-UB 1 4 points. Introduction to Marketing MKTG-UB 1 4 points. Operations Management OPMG-UB 1 Prerequisites: completion of the statistics requirement and a course in regression and forecasting. 4 points.MINOR IN BUSINESS S TUDIES general Information A minimum grade of C is required for all courses intended to count toward the minor, and the minimum overall GPA required in the minor is 2.0. AP (or equivalent international) credit is only accepted for calculus. No credit toward the minor can be granted for internships. All transfer credit must be evaluated by the Preprofessional Advising Center in order to determine its applicability toward the minor; submit course syllabi and transcripts to cas.business@nyu.edu. Note that students may not transfer in more than half of the CAS courses (i.e., two) and half of the Stern courses (i.e., one) to count towards the minor.CAS students should note that all courses taken in Stern for this minor will count toward the 16-point limit on course work in the other divisions of NYU. Students seeking additional non-CAS, non-liberal arts credits beyond the 16-point limit must file a petition with the Committee on Undergraduate Academic Standards in the Office of the Associate Dean for Students, Silver Center, Room 909B; 212-998-8140. 101 BUSINESS S TUDIES C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITY102 CHEMISTRY C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYdepartmental objectives Chemistry is the central natural science interfacing physics and mathematics with the life sciences. Knowledge of chemistry has always been fundamental to the investigation of the physical world, as well as to an in-depth understanding of living systems. Modern chemistry spans chemical physics, materials science, and molecular biology, merging the traditional divisions of analytical, organic, inorganic, and physical chemistry. Recently, the department has focused its growth on physical, biophysical, and bioorganic chemistry, exploiting interdisciplin- ary areas of theory, nanoscience and materials, and biological and biomedical chemistry. The department has a large and active theoretical group in the areas of chemical physics and biomolecular modeling. Graduates of the department find rewarding careers and achieve distinction in all phases of scientific life, from basic research to commercial product development. The late Gertrude Elion, a 1941 M.S. in Chemistry from New York University, shared the 1988 Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology for her research in pharmaceutical chemistry. Phil Baran (B.S. 1997), a professor at the Scripps Research Institute, was named a MacArthur Fellow for 2013. The department offers majors in chemistry and in biochemistry. A selection of elective advanced courses, undergraduate and graduate, can be combined to provide a broad, varied program of study in chemistry.

Professor John W. Draper, the first president of the society and chair of the department, was a remarkable polymath: chemist, physician, philosopher, historian, and pioneering photographer. The department has undertaken a major development plan, strengthening its faculty, instructional laborato- ries, course offerings, and research facilities in the areas of physical, biophysical, bioorganic, and biomedical chemistry, as well as in chemical biology, nanoscience, and materials sciences. Qualified undergraduates are strongly encouraged to participate in research as early as their sophomore year of study. The department houses state-of-the-art laboratory facilities for its undergraduate chemistry courses. Majoring in chemistry at NYU provides strong preparation for graduate study in chemistry and biochemistry; professional education in medicine, dentistry, or patent law; and careers in industrial or pharmaceutical chemistry and biotechnology.chair of the department Professor Ward director of Undergraduate Studies Professor k ahrwww.chemistry.as.nyu.edu Silver Center 100 Washington Square East, Room 1001, New York, NY 10003-6688 212-998-8400 DEPARTMENT OF Chemistry103 CHEMISTRY C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF CHEMISTRY schools of NYU. The programs of study in chemistry prepare students for graduate work toward the master's degree or the doctorate for careers in research, development, and teaching and/or for further study in areas such as medicine, dentistry, basic medical sciences, and allied health fields (including forensic science). In addition, both majors prepare students for alternative careers, especially when paired with a minor in economics or busi-ness studies: for example, patent law, technology investment, or management in the chemical industry. The department offers an honors track that satisfies the first-year chemistry sequence required both for majors and for the prehealth curriculum in medicine, dentistry, and basic medical sciences. Students need permission from the department to register for this honors course. Permission is based on several factors, including background in both mathematics and physics, performance in high school chemistry courses, and a placement examination. majors Students considering a major in chemistry or biochemistry are strongly urged to seek course advisement from the director of undergraduate studies as early in their academic careers as possible. Chemistry is a sequential subject with courses building on earlier courses. Delay in taking certain key prerequisite courses can make it impossible to complete a major in four years without summer attendance. A grade of C or better in chemistry and the other required courses is required for the fulfillment of the chem- istry or biochemistry major in the department. Students who do not have an average of 2.0 in departmentally required courses by the time they have completed 64 points in all courses will be asked to change their major. Core Courses for All Majors in Chemistry and Biochemistry The majors in chemistry or biochemistry build on a core of required courses in chemistry, physics, and math- ematics. The six required core courses (28 points) in chemistry are: General Chemistry I and Laboratory (CHEM-UA 125) General Chemistry II and Laboratory (CHEM-UA 126) Organic Chemistry I and Laboratory (CHEM-UA 225) Organic Chemistry II and Laboratory (CHEM-UA 226) Physical Chemistry: Quantum Mechanics and Spectroscopy (CHEM-UA 651) Physical Chemistry: Thermodynamics and Kinetics (CHEM-UA 652) The advanced and/or majors versions of the general and organic sequences\u2014CHEM-UA 127, CHEM-UA 128, CHEM-UA 227, and CHEM-UA 228 (see course descriptions)\u2014substitute for CHEM-UA 125, CHEM-UA 126, CHEM-UA 225, and CHEM-UA 226, respectively. In addition to these chemistry courses, the chemistry and biochemistry majors require four courses (18 points) in mathematics and physics: Calculus I (MATH-UA 121) Calculus II (MATH-UA 122) General Physics I (PHYS-UA 11) General Physics II (PHYS-UA 12) Calculus III (MATH-UA 123) and Linear Algebra (MATH-UA 140) are strongly recommended as prepara-tion for both Physical Chemistry: Quantum Mechanics and Spectroscopy (CHEM-UA 651) and Physical Chemistry: Thermodynamics and Kinetics (CHEM-UA 652), as well as for students interested in pursuing chemistry on the graduate level or who have an interest in theoretical chemistry. The following sequence covers the content of Calculus II and III (MATH-UA 122, 123) as well as Linear Algebra (MATH-UA 140) in two semesters, and carries a pre-requisite of Calculus I or equivalent: MATH-UA 221 Honors Calculus I: Accelerated Calculus with Linear Algebra MATH-UA 222 Honors Calculus II: Accelerated Calculus with Linear Algebra The core, described above, provides a basic background in chemistry. Students normally are required to com- plete the courses in general chemistry, organic chemistry, physics, and calculus prior to entry into CHEM-UA 651, 652 (physical chemistry) in the third year. Alternative programs are also possible. It is strongly advised, however, that an advanced-level chemistry course be taken in the third year of study, allowing at least three more 104 CHEMISTRY C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF CHEMISTRY semesters to complete all major requirements. Undergraduate specialization in organic, biochemical, physical, or theoretical chemistry may be accomplished through combinations of advanced elective undergraduate and graduate courses open to undergraduates. These courses should be chosen in consultation with the director of undergraduate studies. For students interested in preparation for careers in the chemical industry, several alternatives are available\u2014for example, pairing the major in chemistry with a minor in economics or business studies. Students interested in careers in medicine, dentistry, or basic medical sciences may wish to consider the major in biochemistry. Additional courses in biology may be desirable for such students. The appropriate preprofessional adviser should be consulted for details. The Department of Chemistry offers the following majors: Major in Chemistry, B.A. For students entering CAS in and after fall 2013: The minimum major requirements, in addition to the core courses cited above, are completion of the Physical Chemistry Laboratory course (CHEM-UA 661), Inorganic Chemistry (CHEM-UA 711), and two advanced chemistry elective courses for the B.A. degree. For students who entered CAS prior to fall 2013: The minimum major requirements, in addition to the core courses cited above, are completion of the Physical Chemistry Laboratory course (CHEM-UA 661), Inorganic Chemistry (CHEM-UA 711), and one advanced chemistry elective course for the B.A. degree. Major in Biochemistry For students entering CAS in and after fall 2013: The minimum requirements, in addition to the core courses cited above, are Biochemistry I and II (CHEM-UA 881, 882), Experimental Biochemistry and Laboratory (CHEM-UA 885), Advanced Biochemistry (CHEM-UA 890), and one advanced chemistry elective. Students in this major are reminded that these courses must be taken in the proper order. Careful course planning is required to ensure that this can be done within a normal four-year program. For students who entered CAS prior to fall 2013: The minimum requirements, in addition to the core courses cited above, are Biochemistry I and II (CHEM-UA 881, 882), Experimental Biochemistry and Laboratory (CHEM-UA 885), and Advanced Biochemistry (CHEM-UA 890). Biochemistry students are strongly encouraged to take Cellular and Molecular Biology I and II (BIOL-UA 21, 22) along with Biochemistry. This is especially important for those students wishing to enter graduate programs in biochemistry. In addition to these majors, the department offers several programs and options that may be of interest to students: Program in Chemistry and Engineering The College of Arts and Science offers a joint B.S/B.S. program with the NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering. For students interested in chemistry, the program leads to the B.S. degree from CAS and the B.S. degree in chemi- cal and biomolecular engineering from the NYU School of Engineering. Further information is available from the College Advising Center, Silver Center, 100 Washington Square East, Room 905; 212-998-8130. Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in Chemistry Students who complete the required core courses as outlined above, plus the Physical Chemistry Laboratory course (CHEM-UA 661); Inorganic Chemistry (CHEM-UA 711); three advanced electives in chemistry; at least two semesters of Advanced Independent Study and Research (CHEM-UA 997, 998) or Senior Honors in Chemistry (CHEM-UA 995, 996); and one course in Computer Science (at or above the level of CSCI-UA 2; CSCI-UA 101 preferred) will graduate with the degree of Bachelor of Science (B.S.) instead of the Bachelor of Arts (B.A.). Students should note that the B.S. program is very difficult to complete within a normal four-year academic program and that it confers no particular advantage to students in premedical or predental programs.

Only three of the four courses may also be used to satisfy the requirements of another department's major. No grade lower than C will count toward the minor, and an average of 2.0 or better in all chemistry courses is required. general Information Laboratory courses in chemistry: Due to the potential hazard of any chemical experimentation, safety goggles, laboratory coats, and other protective gear must be worn at all times in the laboratories (but cannot be worn outside the laboratory). Laboratory equipment loaned to students must be replaced if damaged or broken. Students who do not return borrowed laboratory equipment at the end of a course are charged an additional fee, and their grade may be recorded as incomplete and not released until \"checkout\" is completed. Research: The department endeavors to make research opportunities available during the summer and the academic year to well-qualified students at all levels. We strongly urge students who are interested in research to begin as early as freshman year. Students are encouraged to apply for the FAST and DURF grants awarded by the College. To participate in research in the department, students must both meet the prerequisites and register for the research courses Advanced Independent Study and Research (CHEM-UA 997, 998) or, if eligible, Senior Honors in Chemistry (CHEM-UA 995, 996). In either case, permission of the director of undergraduate studies is required before registering in these courses. honors Program The honors program in begins with Advanced General Chemistry I and Laboratory (CHEM-UA 127) and culminates with two semesters of Senior Honors in Chemistry (CHEM-UA 995, 996). Students may graduate with honors without having Advanced General Chemistry or Majors Organic Chemistry courses. However, by the time the student is in the sophomore year, he or she is encouraged to engage in experimental or theoretical research. Depending on the number of credits the student is registered for, the initial exposure to research may or may not be for credit. But there must be, at minimum, one semester of registered Advanced Independent Study and Research (CHEM-UA 997 or CHEM-UA 998) before entering the senior year and conducting senior honors research. Please contact Ms. Carol Hollingsworth, academic program administrator, or Professor Bart Kahr, director of undergraduate studies, for more detailed information. Candidates for a degree with honors in chemistry must have an overall GPA of 3.65 and a GPA of 3.65 in required courses for the chemistry or biochemistry degree. They must take two semesters of Senior Honors in Chemistry (CHEM-UA 995, 996). A senior thesis based on this work must be prepared, approved by the adviser, and presented in a seminar format during the spring term of the senior year. Students desiring entry into the honors program must obtain the approval of the director of undergraduate studies prior to the end of their junior year. coUrSeSThe following courses are lectures unless otherwise indicated.

Tier II consists of elective small lecture courses in the areas of film auteurs, genres, historical movements, national cinemas, television studies, and special topics. Tier III consists of large survey courses in American and international cinema (each having a two- semester sequence: fall, origins to 1960; spring, 1960 to present. Tier IV consists of small theory and practice courses (open only to cinema studies majors) in writing, film criticism, and forms of filmmaking. Majors are required to complete five courses (20 points) in Tier I: Expressive Culture: Film (CORE-UA 750) is the preferred gateway course for CAS students. Note: Introduction to Cinema Studies (CINE-UT 10) is only open to officially declared majors/minors.

Its approach to cinema focuses on the processes of understand- ing film and the moving image in its multiple cultural and interdisciplinary contexts. The undergraduate program treats the study of cinema both as an art form and as a form of mass culture. The study of film, as an art, is concerned with the relationships among film style, narrative form, and the material practices that shape the medium. The study of film as mass culture explores how film reflects societal values and processes of social change. The department offers courses in the history, theory, aesthetics, and criticism of film, as well as film genres and techniques. Certain film courses given in the College of Arts and Science (CAS) may also be approved for the major or minor. Most of the Tisch courses include extensive film screenings and are supplemented by a weekly cinematheque. Students have access to certain Moving Image Archiving and Preservation (MIAP) courses and the Orphans Symposium. Students also have access to extensive film and film-related resources in the department's George Amberg Study Center. The video collection in the Bobst Library's Avery Fisher Center for Music and Media provides additional resources. Finally, various New York City institutions make this an extraordinary environment for cinema studies.118 CINEMA S TUDIES C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF CINEMA S TUDIES Tier I: c ore c ourses Tier I courses are for cinema studies majors only and should be taken in sequence. Introduction to Cinema Studies CINE-UT 10 First semester of study. Allen. 4 points. Designed to introduce the basic methods and concepts of cinema studies to new majors. The first goal is to help students develop a range of analytical skills in the study of film. By the end of the semester, they are fluent in the basic vocabulary of film form, understand the social questions raised by dominant modes of cinematic representation, and grasp the mechanics of structuring a written argument about a film's meaning. The second goal is to familiarize students with some of the major critical approaches in the field (for example, narrative theory, feminism, cultural studies, and genre). To this end, readings and screenings also provide a brief introduction to some critical issues associated with particular modes of film production and criticism (such as documen- tary, narrative, and the avant-garde). Film History: Silent Cinema CINE-UT 15 Second semester of study. Dibbern. 4 points. Examines how the history of cinema has been stud- ied and written by taking the period of silent film advisement In order to declare the cinema studies major and/or be cleared for registration for the forthcoming semester, students must schedule an appointment with the departmental CAS liaison during the following periods: fall semester entrance/clearance, March 15 to April 15; spring semester entrance/clearance, October 15 to November 15. If a student does not meet with the department during these periods, he or she will be asked to declare during the next semester. Students must also have one year of residency at CAS prior to declaring the major; incoming freshmen and transfers are not eligible for immediate declaration upon entrance to the University. cinema Studies m inor A total of four 4-point courses (16 points) is required for the minor. The first course must be either Expressive Culture: Film (CORE-UA 750), recommended for CAS students, or Introduction to Cinema Studies (CINE-UT 10); the latter is only open to officially declared minors. An additional 12 points must be taken in cinema studies courses (CINE-UT), or in courses from elsewhere in the University and preapproved by the Department of Cinema Studies. Included in these 12 points must be one course on international cinema and one Tier II cinema studies course. CAS students may declare the minor on Albert. asian f ilm and m edia m inor A total of four 4-point courses (16 points) is required for the minor.

Greek History from the Bronze Age to Alexander CLASS-UA 242 Identical to HIST-UA 200. Offered every other year. 4 points. Until a few decades ago, Greek history began with Homer and dealt narrowly with the Greek world. Thanks to archaeology, the social sciences, and other historical tools, the chronological and geographical horizons have been pushed back. The history of the Greeks now starts in the third millennium B.C.E. and is connected to the civilization that lay to the 126 CLASSICS C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF CLASSICS east, rooted in Egypt and Mesopotamia.

Starting from the assumption that the study of single texts and cultures is enriched by a knowledge of surrounding texts and cultures, we view literature from a broad and inclusive perspective. We explore the intersections of literature with philosophy, politics, anthropology, history, and literary theory; we illuminate crucial comparisons suggested by drama, music, the visual arts, and modern media; and we examine works not ordinarily seen as literary, tracing their effect on cultural representa-tions of gender, race, and class. general Information The guidelines of our program allow students great flexibility in shaping a course of study suited to their own intellectual goals. While all majors must take four courses originating in the Department of Comparative Literature, our commitment to a global and interdisciplinary outlook means that the remaining six courses required for the major can be taken in other departments or even, by taking advantage of NYU study away opportunities, on other continents. All students planning to major in comparative literature register with the director of undergraduate studies, who works closely with them to develop a coherent sequence of courses suited to their individual interests. Periodical advising sessions with the director of undergraduate studies and a remarkably low student-faculty ratio help our students make the most of the wide range of possibilities that define the major.ProgramfacUl TYchair of the department Professor Lezra director of Undergraduate Studies Associate Professor v atulescu Professors emeriti Braithwaite, Chioles, Javitch, Reiss University Professor; literature and a fricana Studies DiawaraUniversity Professor; Professor of omparative literature and RonellProfessors Apter, Baer, Iampolski, Lezra, k.

In the spirit of our times, students delve into literature from all over the world and explore its intersections with other media and disciplines, such as cinema studies, art history, philosophy, politics, anthropology, history, and linguistics. Comparative literature departmental course offerings include classes in world literature and interdisciplinary studies that allow students to work intensively with a distinguished faculty of scholars in African, African American, Caribbean, Chinese, classical, European and Anglo-American, Latin American, Middle Eastern and Islamic, and Russian and Eastern European literary and cultural studies. At the same time, the major encourages students to take advantage of the rich offerings of courses in other NYU departments and/or study away sites.131 COMPARATIvE LITERATURE C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF C OMPARATIvE LITERATURE To take full advantage of the opportunities provided by comparative literature, students are encouraged to declare the major as early in their academic career as possible. In addition, please note that students planning to study away should consult and declare with the director of undergraduate studies well before their departure. A comparative literature major could lead to the advanced study of literature at the graduate level but could just as readily be a strong foundation for advanced degrees and/or careers in journalism, publishing, international relations, international law, cultural studies, medicine, philosophy, education, public policy, film and entertain-ment, and new media. major The major has two tracks, each consisting of ten 4-point courses (40 points) organized as follows: Track 1: literature This track requires: Four courses (16 points) originating in the Department of Comparative Literature. These four courses must be taught by a faculty member of the Department of Comparative Literature on the Washington Square campus; they cannot be cross-listed courses originating in another department. These four courses must include both of the following: Introduction to Comparative Literature (COLIT-UA 116) Junior Theory Seminar (COLIT-UA 200) Four courses (16 points) in a national literature department at the 100 level or above, conducted in the language of that literature. T wo courses (8 points) in a related cultural field or discipline. Fields could include history, art history, religion, philosophy, classics, politics, cinema studies, and so on, and could also be another foreign language or literary area. If the national literature department selected for specialization is English, these two courses must be in a foreign language. The choice of these courses will be made in consultation with the adviser to form a coherent intellectual field and a defined objective in the major. Track 2: literary and cultural Studies This track requires: Four courses (16 points) originating in the Department of Comparative Literature. These four courses must be taught by a faculty member of the Department of Comparative Literature on the Washington Square campus; they cannot be cross-listed courses originating in another department. These four courses must include both of the following: Introduction to Comparative Literature (COLIT-UA 116) Junior Theory Seminar (COLIT-UA 200) Four courses (16 points) in a related cultural field or discipline.

T wo courses (8 points) in a foreign literature department conducted in the language of that literature, normally at the 100 level or above. double major As a promoter of interdisciplinary work, the department encourages double majors between comparative litera-ture and other departments. The possibility of pursuing a double major should be discussed with the director of undergraduate studies. minor The Department of Comparative Literature welcomes minors. Requirements for a minor in comparative literature consist of four courses originating in the department (i.e., not cross-listed courses originating in other 132 COMPARATIvE LITERATURE C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF C OMPARATIvE LITERATURE departments), which must include Introduction to Comparative Literature (COLIT-UA 116), and reading knowledge of a foreign language. Internships The department offers its majors and minors elective credit for internships in publishing, at literary agencies, and at other professional offices. Please consult the internship section of our website and contact the director of undergraduate studies for more information. honors Program To graduate with honors in the major, a student must maintain at least a 3.65 average in the 10 courses required for the major, earn at least a 3.65 overall GPA in the College of Arts and Science, and write a senior honors thesis in his or her final year. At the end of the junior year, each honors student meets with the director of undergraduate studies for initial advisement and approval. Following this approval, a student may write the honors thesis by taking the Senior Seminar course (COLIT-UA 400) in the fall semester and then enrolling in a thesis writing independent study in the spring semester. This independent study will generally be conducted under the supervision of a faculty member of the Department of Comparative Literature whose area of academic expertise coincides with the focus of the honors thesis. To be awarded honors, a student must complete this two-course sequence and produce a quality senior thesis. The Senior Seminar (COLIT-UA 400) is an 11th course for the major, in addition to the four courses originating in the Department of Comparative Literature and the other six courses for the major.

The creative writing minor must be completed with a minimum grade point average of 2.0 (C). No credit toward the minor is granted for grades of C-minus or lower, although such grades will be computed into the grade point average of the minor, as well as into the overall grade point average. No course to be counted toward the minor may be taken on a pass/fail basis. The introductory workshop and summer intensives may be taken only once for credit. All other workshops may be taken up to three times for credit. T o declare the minor: Students in the College of Arts and Science may declare a creative writing minor by completing the minor declaration form on the program's website. Students in other NYU schools may declare their minors on Albert or as directed by their home schools. The program recommends that all creative writing minors contact the undergraduate programs manager in the semester prior to graduation to verify that their minor declaration is on record and that they have fulfilled (or have enrolled in) all of the appropriate courses for the minor. Course substitution policy: Students may petition to apply a maximum of one outside course toward the minor, either as the introductory prerequisite (equivalent to CRWRI-UA 815) or as an elective. An outside course is any creative writing course without a CRWRI-UA rubric. To petition to substitute an outside course, students must complete the course substitution petition form (available on the program's website) and provide the course syllabus (as described on the petition form). The undergraduate programs manager will review the submitted syllabus to verify course level and determine substitution eligibility. Students should petition for course substitution prior to registration. If the program approves a non-NYU course for substitution, it can be counted toward the minor if 1. The Office of the Associate Dean for Students in CAS has also approved the course credit for transfer, and 2. the student receives a grade of C or better. Fulfilling minor requirements while studying away: Students wishing to begin the creative writing minor while studying away at an NYU site should register for Creative Writing (CRWRI-UA 9815) or, if studying away in the summer, for one of the 8-point intensives offered in Paris and Florence (CRWRI-UA 9818, 9819, 9828, or 9829). These courses are not considered outside courses and will automatically be counted toward the creative writing minor. All other creative writing courses taken away require a petition for substitution and are subject to approval by the program. coUrSeS The minor in creative writing offers an introductory course in poetry and fiction, as well as upper-level courses that focus on specific elements of formal and experimental poetry, fiction, and creative nonfic- tion.

The focus is on visual regimes\u2014differing conventions and practices of seeing\u2014and on changing roles for what is now thought of as aesthetics; these visual regimes are then taken as a means of understanding fundamental transformations in structures of power, community, and subjectivity. Draws on a range of materials, from literature to landscape gardens, visual arts, architecture, and technologies, as well as on a diversity of disciplinary perspectives.161 EAST A SIAN S TUDIES C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF EAST A SIAN S TUDIES Approaches to Chinese Cinema EAST-UA 618 Button. 4 points. The development of the cinema in 20th-century China is inextricably linked to the emergence of the modern Chinese nation-state. As early as the 1920s, film became a vital and influential site of cultural production. This course emphasizes the thematic, cultural, and historical content of films, as well as formal issues of filmmaking techniques. All periods of Chinese film are explored, from the earliest Chinese cinema to contemporary fifth- and sixth- generation film, Hong Kong, and contemporary transnational Chinese cinema. Mass Culture: Japan EAST-UA 707 Looser. 4 points. Looks at transformations in the basic terms and conditions of mass culture in Japan, largely from the early 20th century to life in Japan today. It includes considerations of differing theoretical positions on mass culture, everyday life, and modernity in Japan. Materials taken up in the course include examples from cinema, animation, literature, and theatre, as well as new media and the fine arts. Although the focus is on Japan, a comparative perspective with the rest of Asia and with the West is retained throughout. Japanese Animation and New Media EAST-UA 708 Looser. 4 points. Looks at the terms and conditions of Japanese animation (primarily, though not exclusively, anime) as, in many ways, a new and unique mode of expression. Examines the ways in which anime might, or might not, shift earlier modes of expres- sion (both literary and animated): the prevalence of mythology in animation and the tension between mythology and ideology; the importance of genre; and the impact of \"old\" and \"new\" media on narra-tive structure and reception. Implications of these conditions for thinking about \"Japanese\" culture are also considered. T opics in Japanese Literature EAST-UA 719 4 points. Topics vary semester by semester. Readings in Chinese Philosophy and Culture EAST-UA 722 Formerly Introduction to the Civilization of Imperial China. Roberts. 4 points. Covers Chinese thought during the period ca. 500 B.C.E. to 280 C.E., starting from the era of Confucius (d. 479 B.C.E.) down to the unification of the realm in 206 B.C.E., the pre-imperial period that is also known as the warring states. During this time the main schools of Chinese philosophy (except Buddhism) were established. We begin with the Analects to establish the key elements of Confucius' ethical and political philosophy and to explore the implications of his main philosophical terms. We then proceed to examine his critics and followers: the utilitarian Mozi, the metaphysicians Laozi and Zhuangzi, and the legalist Han Feizi are the critics. Mencius elaborates the thought of Confucius, and Xunzi is both a follower and a critic. This brings us to the transition (ca. 200 B.C.E.) from the pre-imperial to the imperial periods. We end with two historical readings: Sima Qian's Record of the Historian (excerpts) and the novel The Three Kingdoms. The former addresses the moment of transition and the establishment of the Qin and Han dynasties; the latter chronicles the fall of the Han dynasty some four centuries later in 220 C.E. and the reconstitution of a unified realm in 280 C.E. Historical Epics of China and Japan EAST-UA 726 Roberts. 4 points. We compare two military epics of China and Japan, The Three Kingdoms and The T ale of the Heike; and then two romantic epics, The T ale of Genji and The Dream of Red Mansions. These four readings (of which The T ale of Genji alone was written by a woman) are thematically central to their respective cultures. The military epics raise crucial questions about the nature of dynastic rule and the qualifica- tions for kingship, about the relationship of the ruling dynasty to the territory and the people that it rules, and about how diplomatic and military strategies interact. The romantic epics deal with the intrigues of the royal court and the noble elite, the observations and roles of the female characters, and the problem of generational continuity. The course begins with two short readings: the Vietnamese national classic, T ale of Kieu, which is based on Chinese works, and the Chinese fantasy travelogue Monkey (abridged). Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism play a large role in these complex narratives, and due attention is given to how the ideals and doctrines of these three ways of thinking inform the motives and the fates of the characters and the larger design of the authors.

Compares a set of Chinese and Japanese pre-modern dramas, mainly as literature but also as performance, by exploring the contrasts and parallels of incident, character, plot design, and theme of the two theatri- cal traditions. Attention is given to the historical background of each work and to the social condi- tions and customs that each reflects. The cultural salience of each work is also considered. Where possible and appropriate, scenes or entire plays are screened for the class or assigned for viewing. 20th-Century Chinese Literature in Translation EAST-UA 731 Offered every year. 4 points. Explores the changing trends in literary writing and how it relates to the social and historical contexts of the period. Students study the literature to reflect on the culture and self-understanding of modern China. Japan Through Its Literature EAST-UA 734 No knowledge of Japanese required. Roberts. 4 points. Introduces undergraduate students to approximately 10 major Japanese literary works, starting with the 11th-century T ale of Genji, which became a national classic. We go on to read the Zen diary Essays in Idleness, texts of Noh plays, the Chushingura, and plays of Chikamatsu. In the second half of the course, we read a series of modern novels start-ing with Ukigumo (Japan's first modern novel), followed by The Broken Commandment, Sound of the Mountain, and The Waiting Years. Brief response papers to each reading are required, in addition to exams and a longer paper. Vietnam: Its History EAST-UA 737 Identical to HIST-UA 737. Offered every year. 4 points. Focuses on the American War in Vietnam\u2014its origins, its development, and the ways it was fought. It examines how and why American geopolitical and military strategies led to, and shaped, the course of the war. Historical accounts are regularly supple- mented with a reading of parts of the Pentagon Papers and an oral history of those involved in the Vietnam War as told from all sides. Begins by exam- ining Vietnamese cultural and national identity and the impact of French colonialism. We then examine in greater detail the following topics: the war from 1946-54 between the French and the Viet Minh; the early American OSS links with Ho Chi Minh and the reasons for the T ruman administration's deepen- ing commitments to the French; the policies of the Eisenhower administration\u2014from Dien Bien Phu and the Geneva Conference in 1954 to the decision to back Ngo Dien Diem; the deepening commit- ment of the Kennedy administration; the escalating war of the Johnson years; and the end of the war under Nixon and Ford. We conclude by discussing the legacies of the war and interpretations of them. Introduction to Buddhism EAST-UA 832 Identical to RELST-UA 832. 4 points. See description under religious studies.

Students with permission from the director of undergraduate studies may change from the policy concentration to the theory concentration, or vice versa; however, certain rules apply. In either case, no course may be taken for which the student does not have the appropriate prerequisites; this includes the mathematics prerequisites. Students are encouraged to review the Department of Economics website for more information about the eco- nomics major. Students should speak with an adviser in the department to help them plan their major. Advisers are located at 19 West Fourth Street, Rooms 836 and 837. A grade of C or better is required for a course to be counted toward the major in economics, as well as to satisfy the mathematics prerequisites. (No course for the major may be taken pass/fail.) If a student fails a course required for the major, the course must be retaken in the department; a course taken outside the University cannot be substituted for a failed course.

Berkley Term chair of economics and Business LudvigsonSilver Professors; Professors of economics Gale, Professor Paizisclinical assistant Professors Fan, Thaparglobal distinguished Professor LjungqvistThe Department of Economics prepares students to understand individual and group decision making, the structure of markets and economies, and the relationship between regions within the global economy. Although the department is large, its students enjoy an excellent student-faculty rapport. Many of the faculty members are associated with distinguished research institutions. By being able to study with faculty who are actively engaged in research, students learn not only about the fundamentals of economic theory but also how such theory is utilized. They have the opportunity to conduct research on their own. Honors students are required to write an honors thesis under direct faculty supervision. Students majoring in economics have many options open to them after graduation. The major prepares them for graduate school in economics, business management, or public administration. Preprofessional students will find that an economics major not only fosters the discipline medical or law school demands, but provides a solid foundation for these and other careers. Employers and professional schools appreciate the skills acquired by economics students and hire economics majors because they can think quantitatively, qualitatively, and analytically. Studying economics at New York University is especially rewarding because of its urban environment. Students often find career opportunities on Wall Street, at the United Nations, or in various corporate, financial, governmental, agency, and nonprofit institutional settings.164 ECONOMICS C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF ECONOMICS Students must pay close attention to the prerequisites for each course, as they are strictly enforced. Students who do not meet the minimum C requirement in a prerequisite course(s) will be de-enrolled at the beginning of each semester. A grade of P , I, or W does not count as satisfying the minimum grade requirement. T ransfer students should note that transfer credits for the major will be awarded on a case by case basis, and should consult the department's website for details. Given the sequential nature of the major, students are strongly advised to begin the major as early as possible. Ideally, six full semesters are required to complete the major. It is impossible for students to complete the economics major in fewer than five semesters. Beginning fall 2012, new requirements were set for both the policy concentration and the theory concentration in the economics major. Students who entered CAS prior to fall 2012 are grandfathered under the old rules (below). Advanced Standing Acceptable Advanced Placement (AP), A Level, International Baccalaureate (IB), or equivalent credits place students out of one or both of Introduction to Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 1) and Introduction to Microeconomics (ECON-UA 2)\u2014formerly Economics Principles I, II\u2014and also count towards the total number of courses required for the major or minor. For AP credits, a score of 4 or 5 is acceptable. For IB, the College accepts only High Level (HL) exams with a score of 6 or 7; for A Level examinations, CAS accepts a score of B or higher. For more information, or for any other credit by examination, students should consult the tables in the admissions section of this Bulletin or meet with a CAS adviser. Note that AP , A Level, IB, or equivalent credit in statistics is not acceptable for the economics major. In addi- tion, advanced standing credit in calculus does not substitute for either or both semesters of Mathematics for Economics I, II (MATH-UA 211, 212). Exit Exam The economics department requires that all economics majors take an exit exam before they graduate. No preparation is necessary for the exam, and the grade has no impact on a student's academic record. The exam takes only one hour. Students are contacted by the department in their senior year with logistical details. The results will be used by the department to evaluate the major. Policy c oncentration The policy concentration is intended for the student who is primarily interested in applying economic analysis to an understanding of economic problems and policies. The introductory and intermediate courses provide the student with a solid foundation of economic theory with an emphasis on economic applications. The elective courses allow students to focus on specific problems and topics that match their interests and career plans. The policy concentration corresponds most closely to the economics major that is offered by other leading col- leges and universities. Mathematics is used to build an understanding of economic theory. This concentration is particularly well suited for students planning careers in law, public policy, business, or any other field in which a thorough understanding of the economic way of thinking would be beneficial. Students in the policy concentra-tion can also pursue a Ph.D. in economics or finance if they supplement their course work with additional courses in mathematics. Requirements for Policy Concentration for Students Who Enter CAS Fall 2012 or Later At least ten courses (40 points) are to be taken in the Department of Economics for the policy concentration, as follows. Seven core courses are required: Introduction to Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 1; formerly Economic Principles I) Introduction to Microeconomics (ECON-UA 2; formerly Economic Principles II) Intermediate (ECON-UA 11) or Macroeconomics Statistics (ECON-UA 18) or Analytical Statistics (ECON-UA 20)165 ECONOMICS C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF ECONOMICS One course chosen from International Economics (ECON-UA 238), Urban Economics (ECON-UA 227), or Money and Banking (ECON-UA 231) Topics in Econometrics (ECON-UA 380) or Introduction to Econometrics (ECON-UA 266) Policy concentration majors must also take three electives in the department. Of these three electives, at most one can be numbered ECON-UA 200-299 and at least two must be numbered ECON-UA 300-399. A student may choose to take two out of the three courses International Economics (ECON-UA 238), Urban Economics (ECON-UA 227), or Money and Banking (ECON-UA 231). One of them will count towards the core course requirement (above), and the other will count towards the 200-level elective requirement. With permission, students in the policy track will be allowed to take courses from the theory track. Mathematics requirement: In addition to the ten ECON-UA courses noted above, policy concentration students are required to complete both Mathematics for Economics I and Mathematics for Economics II (MATH-UA 211, 212) with a C or better. These two mathematics courses are designed especially for economics majors and must be taken at NYU by all economics policy majors; Advanced Placement (or equivalent) credit in Calculus is not a substitute for them and does not allow a student to place ahead in the two-semester sequence. We strongly recommend that students take Introduction to Microeconomics (ECON-UA 2) and Mathematics for Economics I (MATH-UA 211) in the same semester to obtain the maximum benefit from these courses. Note that Mathematics for Economics I (MATH-UA 211) is a prerequisite for Mathematics for Economics II (MATH-UA 212). Prerequisites and restrictions: Algebra and Calculus (MATH-UA 9), or its equivalent, is required for both Introduction to Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 1) and Introduction to Microeconomics (ECON-UA 2). Introduction to Microeconomics (ECON-UA 2), Mathematics for Economics I (MATH-UA 211), and Mathematics for Economics II (MATH-UA 212) are all required for Intermediate Microeconomics (ECON-UA 10). Introduction to Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 1) and Intermediate Microeconomics are the prerequisites for Intermediate Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 12). Intermediate Microeconomics (ECON-UA 10), Intermediate Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 12), and Statistics (ECON-UA 18) are not open to seniors. Preparation for honors: Students considering honors in the major should speak to an economics adviser as soon as possible. Statistics is to be taken as early as possible. Senior-level courses (300 level and above) presume a knowledge of statistics. Requirements for Policy Concentration for Students Who Entered CAS before Fall 2012 At least ten courses are to be taken in the Department of Economics, as follows. Six core courses: Introduction to Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 1; formerly Economic Principles I) Introduction to Microeconomics (ECON-UA 2; formerly Economic Principles II) Intermediate Intermediate Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 12) Statistics (ECON-UA 18; 6 points prior to fall 2012; see note below) International Economics (ECON-UA 238) Plus four electives in the department. Of these four electives, at least two must be numbered ECON-UA 300-399. Note on statistics: As of fall 2012, Statistics (ECON-UA 18) is a 4-credit course and is no longer 6 points. This is because regression was removed from the syllabus for ECON-UA 18. Students who entered prior to fall 2012 and who did not take the 6-point ECON-UA 18 statistics requirement will take this course in its new 4-point version. The economics department will waive the 2-credit regres- sion requirement for economic policy students who entered CAS prior to fall 2012. These students need ten economics courses (at least 40 credits) for the economics major.166 ECONOMICS C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF ECONOMICS Mathematics requirement: Students grandfathered under the pre-fall-2012 economics policy major are required to take Calculus I (MATH-UA 121) or equivalent with a grade of C or better. Prerequisites and restrictions: Algebra and Calculus (MATH-UA 9), or its equivalent, is the prerequisite for the principles classes, Introduction to Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 1) and Introduction to Microeconomics (ECON-UA 2). Students intending to major in economics must have a strong working knowledge of algebra and introductory calculus. Furthermore, Calculus I (MATH-UA 121) is the prerequisite for both Intermediate Microeconomics (ECON-UA 10) and Intermediate Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 12). Both Economic Principles I (ECON-UA 1) and Economic Principles II (ECON-UA 2) are required for Intermediate Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 12). Theory concentration The theory concentration is intended for the student who wishes to begin the formal study of economic reason- ing with an emphasis on mastering the analytical tools. This concentration relies on a higher level of abstraction and focuses on techniques of economic analysis rather than on the understanding of specific economic problems or institutions. It is particularly well suited for students who intend to pursue a Ph.D. degree in economics or higher degrees in quantitative fields such as finance. Requirements for Theory Concentration for Students Who Enter CAS Fall 2012 or LaterAt least ten courses (40 points) are to be taken in the Department of Economics for the theory concentration, as follows. Six core courses are required: Introduction to Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 1; formerly Economic Principles I) Introduction to Microeconomics (ECON-UA 2; formerly Economic Principles II) Analytical Statistics (ECON-UA 20) Microeconomics (ECON-UA 11) Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 13) Introduction to Econometrics (ECON-UA 266) Theory concentration majors must also take four electives in the department. Of these four electives, at most two can be numbered ECON-UA 200-299 and at least two must be numbered ECON-UA 300-399. Mathematics requirement: In addition to the ten ECON-UA courses noted above, theory concentration students are required to complete both Mathematics for Economics I and Mathematics for Economics II (MATH-UA 211, 212) with a C or better. These two mathematics courses are designed especially for econom- ics majors and must be taken at NYU by all economics theory majors; Advanced Placement (or equivalent) credit in Calculus is not a substitute for them and does not allow a student to place ahead in the two-semester sequence. We strongly recommend that students take Introduction to Microeconomics (ECON-UA 2) and Mathematics for Economics I (MATH-UA 211) in the same semester to obtain the maximum benefit from these courses. Note that Mathematics for Economics I (MATH-UA 211) is a prerequisite for Mathematics for Economics II (MATH-UA 212). Theory concentration majors are not required to take Mathematics for Economics III (MATH-UA 213) (unless they are pursuing a joint major between economics and either computer science or mathematics; see below). They may take MATH-UA 213 as an elective, especially if they are interested in further coursework in mathematics. Prerequisites and restrictions: Microeconomics (ECON-UA 11), Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 13), and Analytical Statistics (ECON-UA 20) are not open to seniors. Students must observe all prerequisites for courses in the theory concentration, as they will be strictly enforced. Requirements for Theory Concentration for Students who Entered CAS before Fall 2012 At least 40 points (10 courses) are to be taken in the Department of Economics: Introduction to Economic 167 ECONOMICS C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF ECONOMICS Analysis (ECON-UA 5), Mathematics for Economists (ECON-UA 6), Analytical Statistics (ECON-UA 20), Microeconomics (ECON-UA 11), Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 13), and Introduction to Econometrics (ECON-UA 266), plus four economics electives. At least two of these electives must be courses numbered ECON-UA 300-399 and designated as theory classes. Students are strongly advised to pay close attention to the prerequisites for each course, as they will be strictly enforced. Furthermore, students must complete Calculus I (MATH-UA 121), Calculus II (MATH-UA 122), and Calculus III (MATH-UA 123). A grade of C or better is needed to pass both the economics and the mathematics requirements. Joint m ajor in e conomics and c omputer Science This is an interdisciplinary major (twenty-two courses/88 points) offered by the Department of Economics with the Department of Computer Science. Only those students that are following the theory track in economics are eligible to pursue this joint major. The major has requirements in three departments, including mathematics. A grade of C or better is necessary in all courses used to fulfill joint major requirements. Interested students should consult with the director of undergraduate studies in both departments for additional information. Requirements for the Joint Major in Economics and Computer Science for Students who Enter CAS Fall 2013 or later The economics requirements (nine courses/36 points) are as follows: Introduction to Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 1; formerly Economic Principles I) Introduction to Microeconomics formerly Economic Principles II) Microeconomics (ECON-UA 11) Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 13) Analytical Statistics (ECON-UA 20) Introduction to Econometrics (ECON-UA 266) T wo ECON-UA theory electives at the 300 level One additional ECON-UA elective The computer science requirements (nine courses/36 points) are as follows: Introduction to Computer Science (CSCI-UA 101) Data Structures (CSCI-UA 102) Computer Systems Organization (CSCI-UA 201) Operating Systems (CSCI-UA 202) Basic Algorithms (CSCI-UA 310) Plus four computer science electives at the 400 level.

A minor enables a student to acquire a useful understanding of economic concepts and analysis without the same degree of coverage as would be obtained in a major. A grade of C or better is required for a course to be counted toward the minor in economics.If a student fails a course required for the minor, the course must be retaken in the department; a course taken outside the University cannot be substituted for a failed course. No course for the minor may be taken as pass/fail. Policy Minor At least 24 points (six courses) are to be taken in the Department of Economics, including Introduction to Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 1; formerly Economic Principles I), Introduction to Microeconomics (ECON-UA 2; formerly Economic Principles II), Statistics (ECON-UA 18), International Economics (ECON-UA 238), and two additional 4-point courses numbered ECON-UA 200-299. All prerequisites will be strictly enforced, including mathematics prerequisites. Theory Minor Requirements for the theory minor for students who enter CAS fall 2012 or later: At least six courses (24 points) are to be taken in the Department of Economics, including Introduction to Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 1; formerly Economic Principles I),Introduction to Microeconomics (ECON-UA 2; formerly Economic Principles II), Analytical (ECON-UA 20), either Microeconomics (ECON-UA 11) or Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 13), and any other two electives in the theory sequence for which the student has the prerequisites.

The program is ideal for the student interested in science and engineering who is also eager for a liberal arts experience before entering an undergraduate engineering environment. Upon completion of this five-year program, students receive both a B.S. degree from the College of Arts and Science and a B.S. degree from the NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering. Students with this combination of degrees are likely to find excellent employment opportunities. The available dual degree combinations are as follows: B.S. in Biology/B.S. in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering B.S. in Chemistry/B.S. in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering B.S. in Computer Science/B.S. in Computer Engineering B.S. in Computer Science/B.S. in Electrical Engineering B.S. in Mathematics/B.S. in Civil Engineering B.S. in Mathematics/B.S. in Computer Engineering B.S. in Mathematics/B.S. in Electrical Engineering B.S. in Mathematics/B.S. in Mechanical Engineering B.S. in Physics/B.S. in Civil Engineering B.S. in Physics/B.S. in Computer Engineering B.S. in Physics/B.S. in Electrical Engineering B.S. in Physics/B.S. in Mechanical Engineering Students in the program complete all of the College Core Curriculum requirements, with the exception of the foreign language requirement, from which they are exempted. (Their required mathematics and science courses automatically satisfy the Core's foundations of scientific inquiry requirements.) There is usually some flexibility concerning the semester in which a given course can be taken, and students with Advanced Placement credit may be able to lighten some of their semester course loads and/or have room for more electives. Detailed programs of study for each of the curricula are available from Mr. Tyrell Davis, the adviser for all students in the various programs. He may be contacted at the College Advising Center, Silver Center, 100 Washington Square East, Room 905, 212-998-8130. Application materials for this dual degree program may be requested from New York University, Office of Undergraduate Admissions, 665 Broadway, 11th Floor, New York, NY 10012-2339.180 ENGINEERING C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDUAL -DEGREE PROGRAM IN ENGINEERING program after the first year is very difficult. Students must maintain satisfactory performance and must complete the required courses in a timely fashion to remain in the program. Their records are reviewed yearly by a faculty committee. The Program Students accepted into the program spend their first three years of study in the College of Arts and Science. In the first year at the College, the different curricula require many of the same foundational courses. This gives students time to consult with faculty in both CAS and the NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering before committing themselves to a particular science/engineering major combination. In the first three years of the program, students satisfy their College Core Curriculum requirements (except for- eign language) and also take some of the engineering courses in their field of interest. This is also when students select a major area from the CAS disciplines of biology, chemistry, computer science, mathematics, and physics. After an orientation program in the spring of the third year, the final two years of study are undertaken at the NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering in downtown Brooklyn, across the East River and a short subway ride from NYU's Greenwich Village campus. Here, students complete the remaining technical courses required for their engineering major. Programs in engineering available to students in the dual degree program include chemical and biomolecular engineering, civil engineering, computer engineering, electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering. Students may elect to withdraw from the dual degree program in engineering and complete only the College of Arts and Science Core and major requirements, thus earning one undergraduate degree from CAS. 181 ENGLISH C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYobjectives The department offers a full and varied curriculum in literary history, critical theory, dramatic literature, theatre history, and literary culture.

Examines how relationships with animals both reflect and shape social life, culture, and how people think about themselves. We explore the myriad and contradictory positions that animals occupy in society and deconstruct the social origins of these seemingly natural categories. We also take a grounded look at what actually happens when humans and animals interact, which sheds new light on the nature of human and animal consciousness. Central questions include: How do ideas about, and relationships to, animals vary across time and space? What roles do science, literature, and media representations play in shaping how we think about animals? Why are some animals, but not others, granted moral status and legal protection in society? Animals and Public Policy ENVST-UA 630 Identical to ANST-UA 500. No prerequisites. Offered in the fall. Wolfson. 4 points.

We also discuss the meaning of \"animal rights\" and the success and impact of the modern animal protection movement.200 EUROPEAN AND MEDITERRANEAN S TUDIES C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYProgramfacUl TY2014-2015 max Weber chair for german and european Studies To be appointed Professors Fleming (History), Schain (Politics), Wolff (History)associate Professor Shaw (European and Mediterranean Studies/Philosophy)assistant Professor Gross (History/European and Mediterranean Studies)director of the c enter Professor Wolffwww.cems.as.nyu.edu 285 Mercer Street, 7th Floor, New York, NY 10003-6653 212-998-3838 major With the help of the European and Mediterranean studies adviser, students prepare a preliminary program outline at the time they declare their major. Although there are no formal tracks, courses are normally organized around the interests of a student in one of two ways: an emphasis on contemporary European and Mediterranean societies\u2014their problems and policies; or an emphasis on contemporary European and Mediterranean cultures\u2014their ideas, values, and artistic and literary trends. The program enables students to organize their courses around a practical or theoretical problem in contempo- rary European society or culture that is applicable to one or several countries. A typical problem might include such subjects as the changing impact of politics on culture and social cleavages; changing patterns of religious expression in Europe; literary expression and changing society in Europe; the European approach to urban problems; migration and ethnicity in Europe; equality and inequality in Europe; and democratic transition in Europe. The problem, for which the tools of several academic disciplines should be applicable, will be the basis for the major research project. Ten 4-point courses (40 points) beyond the introductory level that deal with Europe and the Mediterranean are required: T wo courses in history T wo courses in culture (literature, philosophy, art history, or cinema) T wo courses in the social sciences (politics, anthropology, sociology, or economics) T wo additional courses in any of the three preceding categories One senior honors seminar in European studies One independent study during the final semester, in which students complete and earn a grade for the senior thesis The interdisciplinary senior honors seminar should be taken during the first semester of the senior year.CENTER FOR European and Mediterranean Studies The Center for European and Mediterranean Studies offers an interdisciplinary major and minor in European and Mediterranean studies focusing on contemporary patterns of politics, culture, and society, as well as on historical developments in Europe. Both the major and minor are designed for students seeking preprofessional training for careers in international business and finance, diplomacy, international law, and cultural organizations dealing with Europe. Although open to all students, the minor is especially suited to majors in European languages, history, or the social sciences. The center offers and supports a wide array of activities, including lectures, workshops, and conferences dealing with both Western and Eastern Europe. New York City, which is an international focus for diplomacy, finance, media, and cultural exchange, is an ideal setting for the center and enriches its programs.201 EUROPEAN AND MEDITERRANEAN S TUDIES C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYCENTER FOR EUROPEAN AND MEDITERRANEAN S TUDIES Majors are also required to complete at least one semester of study away. Students may petition the director of the center for exemption from this requirement. Majors in European and Mediterranean studies must have or attain advanced-level knowledge of a major European language other than English (such as French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, German, Greek, or Russian). To demonstrate this knowledge, students must successfully complete an advanced-level language course. The alternative to this is to pass the College of Arts and Science (CAS) proficiency exam prior to graduation. minor All students minoring in European and Mediterranean studies must demonstrate proficiency in at least one European language above the intermediate level (such as French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, or Greek). They must also take four 4-point courses (16 points) as follows: one course in European history; one course in European culture (literature, philosophy, art history, or cinema); one course in social sciences (politics, anthropology, sociology, or economics); and one additional course in any of the three preceding categories. All course programs must be designed in consultation with the center's undergraduate program adviser. B.a./m.a. Program This program offers qualifying majors in European and Mediterranean studies the opportunity to earn both the B.A. and the M.A. degrees at reduced tuition cost. By completing some of their graduate requirements while still undergraduates, students can finish the program in five years. In the graduate portion of the program, students can qualify for a scholarship that covers up to half of the tuition for the courses required for the M.A. European and Mediterranean studies majors may apply for admission to the program after they have completed at least 48 points in the College, but not more than 96 credits or six semesters. Students apply for admission to the B.A./M.A. program through the CAS Advising Center. Applications are reviewed by the Graduate Admission Committee of the Center for European and Mediterranean Studies, using the normal criteria for the M.A. program, except that applicants are not required to take the GRE. The committee bases its decision on students' undergraduate records and recommendations of NYU instructors. A working knowledge at an advanced level of a European language (other than English) is required to complete the program, and knowledge of a second European language is encouraged. Students must spend at least one semester in an approved academic program in Europe, normally during their junior year. Students are also required to write a senior honors thesis and a master's thesis or special project (see below) to earn the two degrees. The program requires a total of eighteen courses: ten undergraduate courses and eight graduate courses. For the first four years, students focus their work on a \"problem area\" that will eventually become the subject of their master's thesis, should they choose this option. The senior honors thesis is an integrative project within the problem area developed by the student and his or her adviser. It may be an expansion of a research paper written for an undergraduate course. The graduate portion of the degree comprises three tracks\u2014European politics and policy, European culture and society, and Mediterranean studies\u2014and students must choose one of these by the beginning of their fifth year. Of the eight graduate courses, two are required: a graduate research seminar in European and Mediterranean studies, as well as the introductory graduate course What Is Europe? (EURO-GA 2301). Students select six additional graduate courses in their chosen track. A 4-point internship, approved by the center, is recommended. Each student's program is organized with his or her adviser at the time that the student enters the program. The first draft of the thesis is developed in the Undergraduate Research Seminar (EURO-UA 300), taken in the fall semester of the fourth year. The master's thesis may be a revision of this project and is further developed in the graduate Research Seminar (EURO-GA 3000), taken in the spring semester of the fifth year. The M.A. thesis or special project will be defended at an oral examination during the spring semester of the fifth year.202 EUROPEAN AND MEDITERRANEAN S TUDIES C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYCENTER FOR EUROPEAN AND MEDITERRANEAN S TUDIES eUroSI m EUROSIM is an annual model European Union simulation designed to enhance students' classroom knowledge of the workings of a politically and economically integrated Europe. The simulation exercise models the legisla-tive procedure of the European Union from the introduction of a draft resolution by the European Commission to the acceptance (or rejection) of an amended document by the European Council. Each year, New York State colleges and universities send a delegation of undergraduate students to EUROSIM to represent one of the member states of the European Union and the European Commission. The legislation on which delegates work is focused on one main theme chosen for its relevance to current European issues. Students individually play the roles of real-life government ministers, members of the European Parliament, and members of the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions. EUROSIM is held in alternating years in the United States and in Europe. In addition, several European univer- sities send students to be part of their respective member-state delegations alongside the American students. In this way, U.S. students receive a \"home-grown\" perspective on the issues that they are debating. coUrSeS Global History of WWII: The Zenith and End of Empire EURO-UA 45 Identical to HIST-UA 45.

A list of the area designations of major and minor programs in the College of Arts and Science (CAS) may be found on the Core Curriculum website. CAS students can also satisfy Societies and the Social Sciences by completing an approved departmental course. For a current list of approved courses, consult the Core Curriculum website.The Foundations of Contemporary Culture (FCC) sequence of the College Core Curriculum seeks to provide students with the perspective and intellectual methods to comprehend the development of our human cultures. The four FCC courses introduce students to the modes of inquiry by which societies may be studied, social issues analyzed, and artistic activity explored. Together, they give undergraduates a broad methodological background on which to draw when later engaged in the more focused work of their major courses of study. As a result, students receive a richer education than any single major could provide. Through this core experience in humanistic and social-scientific inquiry the FCC framework allows students to enter into dialogue with one another despite differences in their course schedules, and in this way also encourages lifelong habits of intellectual curiosity and engagement. As they learn the sound employment of the academic approaches at the center of their FCC classes, students develop their abilities to read critically, think rigorously, and write effectively. By building these skills and an appreciation of the diversity of human experience, the FCC seeks to prepare students for their continued learning in and beyond college, for active participation in their communities, and for lives in a rapidly changing world. All FCC courses are taught by regular faculty, including some of the University's most distinguished profes- sors. In addition to two lectures a week, every FCC course includes weekly recitation sections, allowing for small-group discussion of the readings, close attention to students' written work, and personal concern for students' progress.208 FOUNDATIONS OF C ONTEMPORARY CULTURE C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYFOUNDATIONS OF C ONTEMPORARY CULTURE In addition to the information below, detailed descriptions of each year's course offerings may be found on the Core Curriculum website.

For Muslims, Islam is not simply a set of beliefs or observances, but also includes a history; its study is thus by nature historical, topical, and regional. The emphasis in the pre-modern period is first on the Quran and then on law, political theory, theology, and mysticism. For the more recent period, the stress is on the search for religious identity. Throughout, students are exposed to Islamic societies in the words of their own writings. Cultures and Contexts: Africa CORE-UA 505 Offered every other year. 4 points. Key concepts related to understanding sub-Saharan African cultures and societies, concentrating in particular on teaching students how to think critically and consult sources sensibly when studying non- Western cultures. Topics include problems in the interpretation of African literature, African history, gender issues, African thought and values, the impact of the slave trade and colonialism on African societies and culture. Among the readings are novels, current philosophical theory, and feminist interpretations of black and white accounts of African societies and the place of women in them. Issues are approached with the use of analyses from history, anthropology, sociology, literary theory, and philosophy. Cultures and Contexts: The Chinese and Japanese Traditions CORE-UA 506 Offered every other year. 4 points. Essential aspects of Asian culture\u2014Confucianism, Taoism, Buddhism, and Shintoism\u2014studied through careful reading of major works of phi- losophy and literature. A roughly equal division between Chinese and Japanese works is meant to give a basic understanding of the broad similarities and the less obvious, but all-important, differences among the cultures of Confucian Asia. One reading is a Vietnamese adaptation of a Chinese legend. The last two readings, modern novellas from Japan and China, show the reaction of the traditional cultures to the Western invasions. Cultures and Contexts: Japan\u2014A Cultural History CORE-UA 507 Offered every other year. 4 points. A consideration of the prehistory to Japan's modern- ist transformation through an analysis of key literary, religious, and artistic texts. Concentrates on the historical experiences that produced elements of a national culture before there was a nation and on the consciousness of being Japanese before there was a \"Japan.\" Examines how key cultural elements were used to make a modern nation-state.coUrSeS209 FOUNDATIONS OF C ONTEMPORARY CULTURE C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYFOUNDATIONS OF C ONTEMPORARY CULTURE Cultures and Contexts: The Caribbean CORE-UA 509 Offered every other year. 4 points. The Caribbean is where today's global economy began, some 500 years ago. Its sugar economy and history of slave labor and colonialism made it the site of massive transplantations of peoples and cultures from Africa for more than four centuries and from Asia since the mid-19th century, and of a sizable influx of peoples from Europe all along. Readings examine the history of the region's differ-ing forms of colonialism; the present postcolonial economic and political structures; anthropological material on family and community life, religious beliefs and practices, and gender roles and ideolo- gies; and ways in which national, community, and group identities are expressed today. Cultures and Contexts: Middle Eastern Societies CORE-UA 511 Offered every other year. 4 points. Questions examined in depth include the following: What variety of sources do people in the Middle East draw on to define their sense of who they are\u2014as members of particular households, regions, nations, or religious communities? How do women and men construct their gender identity? In what ways are village, town, and city lives being trans-formed? Do people of the Middle East experience their region's politics the way it is portrayed in the West? What are some of the causes of political repression, armed struggle, or terror? How did European colonialism reshape the lives of people in the region, and how do they today encounter the cultural and economic power of the United States and Europe? Readings are drawn from history, anthropology, political economy, and the contempo-rary literature of the region. Cultures and Contexts: China CORE-UA 512 Offered every other year. 4 points. Fundamental concepts and practices of Chinese society and culture, examined using primary sources in translation whenever possible. By studying the social, political, religious, ideological, ritual, economic, and cultural life of the Chinese, students gain a sense of the core values and issues of Chinese civilization and how these have affected and continue to have an impact on the way people think and live. Cultures and Contexts: Ancient Israel CORE-UA 514 Offered every semester. 4 points. The culture of the ancient Israelite societies of biblical times, covering the period from about 1200 B.C.E. to the conquests of Alexander the Great, in the fourth century B.C.E. Topics include the achievements of these societies in the areas of law and social organization, prophetic movements, Israelite religion, and ancient Hebrew literature. The Hebrew Bible preserves much of the creativity of the ancient Israelites, but archaeological excavations in Israel and neighboring lands, as well as the discovery of ancient writings in Hebrew and related languages, have added greatly to our knowledge of life as it was lived in biblical times. The civilizations of Egypt and Syria-Mesopotamia also shed light on Israelite cul- ture. Of particular interest is the early development of Israelite monotheism, which, in time, emerged as ancient Judaism, the mother religion of Christianity and Islam. Cultures and Contexts: Latin America CORE-UA 515 Offered every other year. 4 points. Explores the cultural, social, and political organiza- tion of indigenous people before the period of European colonization. Studies the dynamics of the colonial encounter, focusing on such themes as indigenous responses to European rule, the formation of \"Indian\" society, and the interaction of Europeans, Africans, and indigenous people. Considers postcolonial Latin America and its politi- cal culture, competing ideologies of economics and social development, and construction of collective identities based on region, race, ethnicity, gender, and class. Readings consist mostly of primary sources and allow students to hear diverse voices within Latin American society. Works by European conquerors, Inca and Aztec descendants in the colonial period, and African and creole slaves are studied. Novels, short stories, films, photographs, and music are also included. Cultures and Contexts: India CORE-UA 516 Offered every other year. 4 points. Considers the paradoxes of modern India: ancient religious ideas coexisting with material progress, hierarchical caste society with parliamentary democracy, and urban shantytowns with palatial high-rises. Integrates research on India's cultural values with social-scientific perspectives on their contemporary relevance. Examines problems such as protective discrimination for lower castes and cultural nationalism. Shows how democracy involves difficult choices among competing, often opposed, ancient and modern cultural values.210 FOUNDATIONS OF C ONTEMPORARY CULTURE C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYFOUNDATIONS OF C ONTEMPORARY CULTURE Cultures and Contexts: Contemporary Latino Cultures CORE-UA 529 Offered every year. 4 points. Examines the growth and development of \"Latino\" as a distinct category of identity out of the highly diverse populations of Latin American background in the United States, paying particular attention to the social processes shaping its emergence. Provides a detailed examination of the processes of cultural creation behind the rising growth of transnational cultures and identities worldwide, and of the forces that are fueling their development. Begins by explor- ing the immigration of Latin American peoples to U.S. cities, then turns to three case studies of emerging Latino communities, and ends by examin- ing contemporary issues involving Latinos in urban centers such as New York. Cultures and Contexts: The African Diaspora CORE-UA 532 Offered every year. 4 points. The dispersal of Africans to various parts of the world and over time, examining their experiences and those of their descendants. Regions of special interest include the Americas and the Islamic world, centering on questions of slavery and freedom while emphasizing the emergence of cultural forms and their relationship to both African and non-African influences. Cultures and Contexts: Indigenous Australia CORE-UA 536 Offered every other year. 4 points. The indigenous people of Australia have long been the subject of interest and imagination by outsiders for their cultural formulations of kinship, ritual, art, gender, and politics, and they have entered into representations as distinctively \"other\"\u2014whether in negative or positive formulations of the \"primitive.\" These representations\u2014in feature films about them such as Walkabout and Rabbit-Proof Fence, in New Age literature, or in museum exhibitions\u2014are now also in dialogue with their own forms of cultural production. At the same time, Aboriginal people have struggled to reproduce themselves and their traditions in their own terms, asserting their right to forms of cultural autonomy and self-determination. We explore the historical and geographical range of Aboriginal Australian forms of social being through ethnographic texts, art, novels, autobiographies, film, and other media, and consider the ways in which identity is being challenged and constructed.Cultures and Contexts: Modern Israel CORE-UA 537 Offered every year. 4 points. Despite its small size and population, Israel is a diverse, dynamic, and complex society. To understand its ethnic, religious, and political divisions, the different ethnic origins of the Jewish population over the last 150 years are examined, and the growing role of the Arab population (approaching 20 percent) in Israeli society is discussed. The special role of religion in the secular state, the development of Hebrew-speaking culture, the political system, the settlement movement and the peace movement, gender issues, and the role of the army in everyday life are all addressed, concluding with a survey of the debate on whether Israel is a Jewish state or a state of all its citizens. Although the controversial issues that keep Israel in the headlines are touched on, the focus is on the character of Israeli society and the impact on everyday life of living in the international limelight. Cultures and Contexts: Asian/Pacific/American Cultures CORE-UA 539 Offered every year. 4 points. Major issues in the historical and contemporary experiences of Asian Pacific Americans, includ- ing migration, modernization, racial formation, community-building, and political mobilization. Asian Pacific America encompasses a complex, diverse, and rapidly changing population of people. Particular attention is given to Asian Americans' use of cultural productions (films, literature, art, media, and popular culture) as an expression and reflection of their cultural identities, historical conditions, and political efforts. Cultures and Contexts: New World Encounters CORE-UA 541 Offered every year. 4 points. What was America before it was called America? How did indigenous cultures understand and docu-ment their first encounters with Europeans? We focus on peoples, events, and cultural expressions associated with the conquest and colonization of the Americas, concentrating on three key areas: central Mexico, home to several pre-Columbian societies, most nota- bly the Aztec Empire, and later the seat of Spanish power in northern Latin America (the Viceroyalty of New Spain); the central Andes, home of the Incas and later the site of Spanish power in southern Latin America (the Viceroyalty of Peru); and finally, early plantation societies of the Caribbean, where the violent history of enslaved Africans in the new world unfolded. On one hand, we explore how those subjugated by conquest and colonialism interpreted, 211 FOUNDATIONS OF C ONTEMPORARY CULTURE C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYFOUNDATIONS OF C ONTEMPORARY CULTURE resisted, and recorded their experience. On the other, we ask what new cultural forms emerged from these violent encounters, and consider their role in the foundation of \"Latin American\" cultures. Readings balance a range of primary documents and art created during the \"age of encounter,\" including maps, let- ters, paintings, and testimonials, along with historical and theoretical texts. Cultures and Contexts: Korea CORE-UA 543 Offered every other year. 4 points. A multi-disciplinary introduction to Korean society and culture, surveying Korean history from antiquity to the present though a wide range of primary sources from the past, including archaeological relics, written records, and works of art, as well as contemporary materials by Korean authors, directors, and other cultural producers. Considers the origins of Korean \"tradition,\" the formation and development of social relations, popular beliefs, and systems of thought that have shaped the Korean way of life, in order to locate their resonances and ramifications in modern Korea, particularly in cultural representations. Continues with Korea's \"transformation\" through its encounter with the West, its modern experiences and national struggle under colonial rule, social upheavals after liberation, and the Korean War. Concludes by tracing the enduring impacts of the unresolved past on contem-porary society, Korea \"today\" in terms of economic development and crisis, the democracy movement and its limitations, relations with North Korea and with the US, and sociocultural diversification in the age of globalization. To forge critical perspectives on Korean history, society, and culture, students are encouraged to situate these topics within the broader contexts of East Asia and the world. Cultures and Contexts: Spain CORE-UA 544 Offered every year. 4 points. What does Spanish culture look like? What are the different materials that Spanish artists and writers have chosen to articulate the often complex understandings they have of themselves, their nation(s), their relation to modernity (its opportuni-ties and challenges), and the broader international community? We approach Spanish culture critically by learning about specific works and the contexts within which they exist, focusing on the mid- nineteenth century through the late twentieth century, including fiction, poetry, film (fiction and documentary), painting, poster art, photography, performance, and architecture. Students actively engage in an informed analysis of cultural works from Spain in order to better understand and question the relation between cultural forms and questions of national identity, tradition, modernity, and authorship as they relate to the historical moment and location in which they are produced. Cultures and Contexts: Egypt of the Pharaohs CORE-UA 545 Offered every year. 4 points. The archaeology, literature, and art of ancient Egypt all offer insights into its culture. Subjects of special interest are ancient Egyptian religious experiences and ethics, as well as constructions of gender, class, and ethnicity. Settlements that are particularly well documented through both archaeological and textual remains\u2014such as Kahun and Deir el-Medina\u2014yield extensive information about the varieties of social experience in these societies. Lives differed tremendously based on gender, profession, and locality (both spatial and temporal). Likewise, we explore how Egyptians, regardless of social standing, attempted to alter their socio-political circumstances through avenues such as concerted political action, magic, revolt, or the construction of well-crafted satire. Primary sources include letters, wisdom literature, love poetry, ancient house plans, tomb scenes, and physical anthropology. Cultures and Contexts: Global Asia CORE-UA 546 Offered every other year. 4 points. Explores the expansive transformation of Asian cultures from ancient times to the present, focusing on networks of mobility, interaction, social order, and exchange that form the particularity of Asian cultures through entanglements with others. Beginning in the days of Alexander the Great and the formation of the Afro-Eurasian ecumene, follows the tracks of Buddhist, Confucian, Hindu, and Muslim expansion and then turns to the age of early modern landed empires, Ottoman-Safavid-Mughal-Ming/Ching, and their interactions with seaborne European expansion. Studies truly global formations of culture in the flow of goods, ideas, and people among world regions, during the age of modern empires and nationalism, including the rise of the nation as a cultural norm, capitalism in Asia, and Japanese expansion around the Pacific Rim. Concludes by considering cultural change attending globalization since the 1950s, focusing on entanglements of Asian cultures with the globalizing culture of the market, consumerism, and wage labor, and transnational labor migration, as well as Asian cultural spaces in and around New York City, including our nearby Chinatown.212 FOUNDATIONS OF C ONTEMPORARY CULTURE C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYFOUNDATIONS OF C ONTEMPORARY CULTURE Cultures and Contexts: Italy CORE-UA 554 Offered every year. 4 points. Italian culture seen through the lens of its most emblematic site and subject: Rome ancient and modern, mythical and historical, visual and verbal. Epitomizing the very notion of cultural perpetuity, Rome\u2014in its artifacts and images, its politics and its myths, its models of democracy and empire\u2014lurks at the heart of Italian identity. We examine the Eternal City in its aesthetic and historical specificity\u2014its importance as an actual place\u2014and also as an idea and an ideal, put to various political and cultural ends in the forma-tion of Italians' visions of themselves. We thus consider the enduring and shifting significance of Rome for Italian self-understanding, beginning with the founding and development of the city, through its various \"rebirths\" in the Renaissance, the Italian Risorgimento, and the Fascist regime, and also briefly consider the vitality of Rome and its histories/myths in other national traditions, political movements, and aesthetic programs, from France to the United States. Societies and the Social Sciences Note that the prerequisite for all Societies and the Social Sciences courses is completion of Texts and Ideas (CORE-UA 4XX) and Cultures and Contexts (CORE-UA 5XX), as well as completion of (or exemption from) Writing the Essay (EXPOS-UA 1), Writing II (WRI-UF 2002), or International Writing Workshop II (EXPOS-UA 9). Societies and the Social Sciences: T opics in Interdisciplinary Perspective CORE-UA 600 Offered occasionally. 4 points. Examines social phenomena that cross the boundar- ies among the various social-scientific disciplines. Topics vary each term and may include, for example, human migration, religion, fascism, or colonialism. By considering the methodologies appropriate to the study of these topics, students learn to appreciate the characteristic approaches of the social sciences, their power to help us understand such phenomena, and their limitations. expressive culture Note that the prerequisite for all Expressive Culture courses is completion of Texts and Ideas (CORE-UA 4XX) and Cultures and Contexts (CORE-UA 5XX), as well as completion of (or exemption from) Writing the Essay (EXPOS-UA 1), Writing II (WRI-UF 2002), or International Writing Workshop II (EXPOS-UA 9). Expressive Culture: Words CORE-UA 710 Offered occasionally. 4 points. What is literature or the literary? Is there a literary language that works differently from ordinary lan-guage? What is literary style and form? What is the position of the writer or artist in relation to society, and what is the function of the reader? Is literature a mirror of the world that it describes, an attempt to influence a reader's ideas or opinions, an expression of the identity of the writer, or none of these? Expressive Culture: The Graphic Novel CORE-UA 711 Offered every other year. 4 points. Examines the interplay between words and images in the graphic novel, a hybrid medium with a system of communication reminiscent of prose fiction, anima- tion, and film. What is the connection between text and art? How are internal psychology, time, and action conveyed in a static series of words and pictures? What can the graphic novel convey that other media cannot? Authors include Alan Moore, Art Spiegelman, Peter Milligan, Charles Burns, and Carla Speed McNeil. Expressive Culture: Images CORE-UA 720 Offered every year. 4 points. What is the place of art in an image-saturated world? We begin by considering the power and taboo of images and the ways in which individuals and institutions that constitute \"the art world\" classify some of these images as works of art; turn to explore the visual and conceptual challenges presented by major works of sculpture, architecture, and painting; and conclude with a selection of problems raised by art today. Students develop the vocabulary to both appreciate and question the artistic \"gestures\" of society in various places and times. Expressive Culture: Painting and Sculpture in New York Field Study CORE-UA 721 Offered every spring. 4 points. New York's public art collections contain important examples of painting and sculpture from almost every phase of the past, as well as some of the world's foremost works of contemporary art. Meets once a week for an extended period and combines on-campus lectures with group excursions to the museums or other locations where these works are exhibited.213 FOUNDATIONS OF C ONTEMPORARY CULTURE C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYFOUNDATIONS OF C ONTEMPORARY CULTURE Expressive Culture: Architecture in New York Field Study CORE-UA 722 Offered every fall. 4 points. New York's rich architectural heritage offers a unique opportunity for firsthand consideration of the concepts and styles of modern urban architecture, as well as its social, financial, and cultural contexts. Meets once a week for an extended period and combines on-campus lectures with group excursions to prominent buildings. Consideration is given both to individual buildings as examples of 19th- and 20th-century architecture, as well as to phenomena such as the development of the skyscraper and the adaptation of older buildings to new uses. Expressive Culture: Sounds CORE-UA 730 Offered every semester. 4 points. Our lives pulsate with patterns of sounds that we call music. We encounter these sounds in our homes, cars, stores, and exercise salons; they accompany us to the grocery store, the dentist's office, and the movies. Yet we rarely think consciously about what they mean. Through a series of specific case studies, we investigate the function and significance of music and the musician in human life. We raise basic questions about how music has been created, produced, perceived, and evaluated at diverse histori- cal moments, in a variety of geographical locations, and among different cultural groups. Through aural explorations and discussion of how these vivid worlds \"sound\" in time and space, we assess the value of music in human experience. Expressive Culture: Performance CORE-UA 740 Offered every other year. 4 points. Examines \"performance\" both as a practice and as a theoretical tool with which to understand today's world. The broad spectrum of live performance is explored by means of lectures, discussions, and field trips. Students look at theatre and dance, performance in everyday life, rituals, popular entertainments, and intercultural performance. On the theoretical level, students are to \"speech acts,\" \"restored behavior,\" \"ritual process,\" and \"play.\" Students see a broad variety of performances, such as Native American powwow, Indian Hindu ritual drama, off-Broadway theatre and dance, African American gospel, street performers, and courtroom trials.Expressive Culture: Film CORE-UA 750 Offered every semester. 4 points. Film is a medium that combines a number of arts. It lies at the intersection of art and technology and of art and mass culture, and at the boundaries of the national and the global. Film is also a medium that coincides with and contributes to the invention of modern life. By exploring the expressive and repre- sentational achievements of cinema in the context of modernity and mass culture, students learn the concepts to grasp the different ways in which films create meaning, achieve their emotional impact, and respond in complex ways to the historical contexts in which they are made. Expressive Culture: La Belle \u00c9poque CORE-UA 761 Offered every other year. 4 points. La Belle \u00c9poque, that period in the life of France's pre-World War I Third Republic (1871-1914) associated with extraordinary artistic achievement, saw Paris emerge as the undisputed Western capital of painting and sculpture; it also was the most important production site for new works of musical theatre and, arguably, literature. It was during these decades that Impressionism launched its assault on the academic establishment, only itself to be superseded by an ever-changing avant-garde associated first with the nabis, then with fauvism and cubism; that the operas of Bizet, Saint-Sa\u00ebns, and Massenet and the plays of Sardou and Rostand filled the world's theatres; and that the novels of Zola and stories of Maupassant were translated into dozens of languages. Finally, this was the society that gave birth to one of the greatest literary works of all time, Marcel Proust's Remembrances of Things Past, the first volume of which appeared just as the First World War was about to bring the Belle \u00c9poque to a violent end. Sources include reproductions of paintings, recordings of chamber music, opera and m\u00e9lodies, and several of the most significant novels of the period. 214 FOUNDATIONS OF SCIENTIFIC INQUIRY C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYProgramdirector of the c ollege c ore curriculum Professor Semple director of Undergraduate Studies for f oundations of Scientific Inquiry Clinical Professor Jordanwww.core.cas.nyu.edu Silver Center 100 Washington Square East, Room 903, New York, NY 10003-6688 212-998-8119 Foundations of Scientific Inquiry Prerequisites and Sequencing In the FSI sequence, students choose one course in Quantitative Reasoning (CORE-UA 1XX), followed by one in the physical sciences from the Natural Science I grouping (CORE-UA 2XX), and then one in the biological sciences from the Natural Science II grouping (CORE-UA 3XX).

Even more than their forebears, citizens of the 21st century will need competence and confidence in dealing with the approaches and findings of science if they are to make informed decisions on vital political, economic, and social issues. Rather than striving for encyclopedic coverage of facts, Foundations of Scientific Inquiry (FSI) courses in the College Core Curriculum stress the process of scientific reasoning and seek to illustrate the role of science and math-ematics in our understanding of the natural world. The objectives of the FSI sequence are to give students who will not be science majors a positive experience in scientific inquiry and to encourage learning about how science is done. The quantitative component of these courses emphasizes the critical role of math-ematics in the analysis of natural phenomena. The courses within FSI are organized into three groups: Quantitative Reasoning, Natural Science I, and Natural Science II. All lectures are taught by regular faculty, including some of the University's most distinguished professors, and each course includes a weekly workshop or related laboratory section.215 FOUNDATIONS OF SCIENTIFIC INQUIRY C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYFOUNDATIONS OF SCIENTIFIC INQUIRY Mathematics for Economics I (MATH-UA 211) Honors Calculus I (MATH-UA 221) Quantitative Methods in Political Science (POL-UA 800) Statistics for the Behavioral Sciences (PSYCH-UA 10) Biostatistics in Public Health (UGPH-GU 20) Natural Science I and II This sequence is satisfied by one of the following options: AP or equivalent credit for Biology (8 points), Chemistry (8 points), Physics B (10 points), or both Physics C-Mech (3 points) and Physics C-E&M (3 points) Completion of one of the following sequences: Natural Science I and II (CORE-UA 2XX and CORE-UA 3XX) General Chemistry I and Laboratory (CHEM-UA 125) and General Chemistry II and Laboratory (CHEM-UA 126) Advanced General Chemistry I and Laboratory (CHEM-UA 127) and Advanced General Chemistry II and Laboratory (CHEM-UA 128) General Physics I and II (PHYS-UA 11, 12) Physics I and II (PHYS-UA 91 and 93) and Introductory Experimental Physics I and II (PHYS-UA 71, 72) Natural Science I This requirement is satisfied by one of the following options: AP or equivalent credit for Physics C-Mech (3 points) or Physics C-E&M (3 points) AP credit for Environmental Science (4 points) Completion of one of the following: Natural Science I (CORE-UA 2XX) General Chemistry I and Laboratory (CHEM-UA 125) Advanced General Chemistry I and Laboratory (CHEM-UA 127) General Physics I (PHYS-UA 11) Physics I (PHYS-UA 91) and Introductory Experimental Physics I (PHYS-UA 71) Natural Science II This requirement is satisfied by one of the following options: Natural Science II (CORE-UA 3XX) Principles of Biology I (BIOL-UA 12) and Principles of Biology Laboratory (BIOL-UA 123) Human Evolution (ANTH-UA 2) coUrSeS In addition to the information listed below, detailed descriptions of each year's course offerings may be found on the Core Curriculum website.

Quantitative Reasoning: Great Ideas in Mathematics CORE-UA 110 Offered every year. Hanhart. 4 points. A variety of topics chosen from the following broad categories. A survey of pure mathematics: What do mathematicians do and what questions inspire them? Great works: What are some of the historically big ideas in the field? Who were the mathematicians that came up with them? Mathematics as a reflection of the world we live in: How does our understanding of the natural world affect mathematics (and vice versa)? Computations, proof, and mathematical reasoning: Quantitative skills are crucial for dealing with the sheer amount of information available in modern society. Mathematics as a liberal art: Historically, some of the greatest mathematicians have also been poets, artists, and philosophers. How is mathematics a natural result of humanity's interest in the nature of truth, beauty, and understanding?Natural Science I Note that the prerequisite for all Natural Science I courses is completion of (or exemption from) Quantitative Reasoning (CORE-UA 1XX). Natural Science I: Energy and the Environment CORE-UA 203 Offered every semester. Jerschow, Kallenbach,Walters. 4 points. Uses the principles of chemistry to analyze the envi- ronmental implications of energy usage and policy decisions concerning energy and the environment. Topics include the composition of the atmosphere, the ozone layer and its depletion, global warming and public policy, and acid rain. Finally, the basis of our need for energy, fossil fuels and their supplies, and the available alternatives are discussed. Natural Science I: Einstein's Universe CORE-UA 204 Offered every year. Adler, Brujic, Budick, Dvali, Sokal, Weiner. 4 points. Addresses the science and life of Einstein in the context of 20th-century physics, beginning with 19th-century ideas about light, space, and time to understand why Einstein's work was so innovative. Einstein's most influential ideas are contained in his theories of special relativity, which reformulated conceptions of space and time, and general relativity, which extended these ideas to gravitation. Both these theories are quantitatively explored, together with wide-ranging applications of these ideas, from the nuclear energy that powers the sun to black holes and the big bang theory of the birth of the universe. Natural Science I: Exploration of Light and Color CORE-UA 205 Offered every other year. Adler. 4 points. Color science is an interdisciplinary endeavor that incorporates both the physics and perception of light and color. This introduction to color and the related topics of light and optics includes their applica-tions to photography, art, natural phenomena, and technology. Topics include how color is described and measured (colorimetry); how light is produced; how atoms and molecules affect light; how the human retina detects light; and how lenses are used in cameras, telescopes, and microscopes. Our investigation necessarily touches on aspects such as the anatomy of the eye and aspects of human vision that influence how we see color. Laboratory projects include additive and subtractive color mixing, pin- hole photography, cow-eye dissection, colorimetric measurements, and color-classification schemes.217 FOUNDATIONS OF SCIENTIFIC INQUIRY C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYFOUNDATIONS OF SCIENTIFIC INQUIRY Natural Science I: From Quarks to Cosmos CORE-UA 209 Offered every year. Adler, Cranmer, Mincer, Modjaz, Weiner. 4 points. Modern science has provided us with some under-standing of age-old fundamental questions, while at the same time opening up many new areas of inves- tigation. How old is the universe? How did galaxies, stars, and planets form? What are the fundamental constituents of matter, and how do they combine to form the contents of the universe? We consider how measurements and chains of scientific reasoning have allowed us to reconstruct the Big Bang by measur- ing little wisps of light reaching the earth, to learn about subatomic particles by use of many-mile-long machines, and to combine the two to understand the universe as a whole from the subatomic particles of which it is composed. Natural Science I: How Things Work CORE-UA 214 Offered every year. Adler, Grier, Stein. 4 points. Do you know how electricity is generated? How instruments create music? What makes refrigerator magnets stick? For that matter, why ice skating is possible, how wheels use friction, and why someone can quickly remove a tablecloth without moving any dishes? All of the devices that define contemporary living are applications of basic scientific discoveries. The principles underlying these devices are fascinat-ing as well as useful and help to explain many of the features of the world around us. Covers basic principles of physics by examining selected devices such as CD and DVD players, microwave ovens, the basic electronic components of computers, lasers and LEDs, magnetic resonance imaging as used in medicine, and even nuclear weapons. Natural Science II Note that the prerequisite for all Natural Science II courses is completion of (or exemption from) Quantitative Reasoning (CORE-UA 1XX). Completion of (or exemption from) Natural Science I (CORE-UA 2XX) is recommended as a prerequisite. Natural Science II: Human Genetics CORE-UA 303 Offered every year. Blau, Rockman, Small. 4 points. We are currently witnessing a revolution in human genetics, where the ability to scrutinize and manipulate DNA has allowed scientists to gain unprecedented insight into the role of hered-ity. Begins with an overview of the principles of inheritance, where simple Mendelian genetics is contrasted with the interactions of genes and environment that influence complex physical or behavioral traits. Descending to the molecular level, we investigate how genetic information is encoded in DNA and examine the science and social impact of genetic technology, including topics such as cloning, genetic testing, and the human genome project. Concludes by studying how genes vary in populations and how geneticists are contributing to our understanding of human evolution and diversity. Natural Science II: Human Origins CORE-UA 305 Offered every year. Anton, Bailey, Disotell, Harrison. 4 points. The study of \"human origins\" is an interdisciplinary endeavor that involves a synthesis of research from a number of different areas of science. Introduces students to the various approaches and methods used by scientists to investigate the origins and evo- lutionary history of our own species. Topics include reconstructing evolutionary relationships using molecular and morphological data; the mitochon-drial Eve hypothesis; ancient DNA; human variation and natural selection; the use of stable isotopes to reconstruct dietary behavior in prehistoric humans; solving a 2,000-year-old murder mystery; the impor- tance of studies of chimpanzees for understanding human behavior; and the four-million-year-old fossil evidence for human evolution. Natural Science II: Brain and Behavior CORE-UA 306 Offered every semester. Fenton, Glimcher, Hawken, Kiorpes, Suzuki. 4 points. Begins with the basic elements that make up the nervous system and how electrical and chemical signals in the brain work to affect behavior. Examines how the brain learns and how it creates new behaviors, together with the brain mechanisms that are involved in sensory experience, movement, hunger and thirst, sexual behaviors, the experience of emotions, perception and cognition, and memory and the brain's plasticity. Other key topics include whether certain behavioral disorders like schizophre- nia and bipolar disorder can be accounted for by changes in the function of the brain and how drugs can alter behavior and brain function. Natural Science II: The Molecules of Life CORE-UA 310 Offered every year. Jordan, Kallenbach. 4 points. Our lives are increasingly influenced by the availabil-ity of new pharmaceuticals, ranging from drugs that 218 FOUNDATIONS OF SCIENTIFIC INQUIRY C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYFOUNDATIONS OF SCIENTIFIC INQUIRY lower cholesterol to those that influence behavior. Critical to the function of such biomolecules is their three-dimensional structure that endows them with a specific function. Examines the chemistry and biology of biomolecules that make up the molecular machinery of the cell. Begins with the principles of chemical binding, molecular structure, and acid-base properties that govern the structure and function of biomolecules. Applies these principles to study the varieties of protein architecture and how enzymes facilitate biochemical reactions. Concludes with an overview of molecular genetics and how recent information from the Human Genome Project is stimulating new approaches in diagnosing disease and designing drug treatments. Natural Science II: Lessons from the Biosphere CORE-UA 311 Offered every year. Volk. 4 points. Provides a foundation of knowledge about how earth's biosphere works. This includes the biggest ideas and findings about biology on the global scale\u2014the scale in which we live. Such knowledge is especially crucial today because we humans are perturbing so many systems within the biosphere. Major topics: (1) Evolution of Life: How did life come to be what it is today? (2) Life's Diversity: What is life like today on the global scale? (3) Cycles of Matter: How do life and the nonliving environ- ment interact? (4) The Human Guild: How are humans changing the biosphere, and how might we consider our future within the biosphere? Includes laboratory experiments and an exploration at the American Museum of Natural History. Natural Science II: Earth, Life, and Time CORE-UA 312 Offered every other year. Rampino. 4 points. Over the last four billion years, life on Earth has evolved in response to changes in the environment. At the same time, major innovations in the history of life have led to transformations of the Earth's physical environment. We examine the history of the intimate relationship between the Earth's changing environment and the evolution of life on the planet. This long-term historical perspective provides a context for understanding current environmental issues such as global warming, tropical deforestation, and loss of biodiversity.Natural Science II: The Brain: A User's Guide CORE-UA 313 Offered every year. Azmitia. 4 points. The human brain is the most complex organ. Despite the central position it has in nearly every aspect of our daily lives, it remains to many a mystery. How does it work? How can we care for it? How long will it function? We learn about the func-tions of the cortex in higher learning and memory, as well as discuss the basic work of the brain stem in regulating the internal environment of the body. The importance of nutrition on neurotransmitter synthesis, the function of sleep on memory and why we need so much of it, and the effects of alcohol and drugs on brain harmony and the meaning of addic- tion are covered. We look at brain development and the special needs of children, as well as brain aging and illness and the difficulty of helping. Laboratories provide hands-on experience in exploring the structure of the brain, as well as learning how to measure brain function. Natural Science II: Genomes and Diversity CORE-UA 314 Offered every other year. Siegal. 4 points. Millions of species of animals, plants, and microbes inhabit our planet. Genomics, the study of all the genes in an organism, is providing new insights into this amazing diversity of life. We begin with the fun- damentals of DNA, genes, and genomes. We then explore microbial diversity, with an emphasis on how genomics can reveal many aspects of organisms, from their ancient history to their physiological and ecological habits. We follow with examinations of animal and plant diversity, focusing on domesticated species, such as dogs and tomatoes, as examples of how genomic methods can be used to identify genes that underlie new or otherwise interesting traits. Genomics has also transformed the study of human diversity and human disease. We examine the use of DNA to trace human ancestry, as well as the use of genomics as a diagnostic tool in medicine. With the powerful new technologies to study genomes has come an increased power to manipulate them. We conclude by considering the societal implications of this ability to alter the genomes of crop plants, livestock, and, potentially, humans.219 FRENCH C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYmajor in f rench The prerequisite for admission to the program is a satisfactory knowledge of the French language.

No grade lower than a C counts toward this minor. Literature in Translation See the section on literature in translation in this Bulletin. Francophone Studies This minor is for students with an interest in French-language literature and culture outside of France (e.g., in Africa, the Caribbean, Canada, the U.S., or the Far East). This minor consists of four courses (16 points). Approaches to Francophone Literature (FREN-UA 145) is required; the three other courses must be taught in French and chosen in consultation with the director of undergraduate studies. With permission of the French department, a course taught in English can be counted toward this minor if the coursework is completed in French. Courses focusing on the literature or culture of France do not count toward this minor. No grade lower than a C counts toward this minor. Internships In addition to the basic requirements for the major, students also have the opportunity to participate in intern- ships sponsored by the Department of French. Recent internships have been completed at the French cultural services office, the French music office, and the French film office. For more information, please contact the undergraduate administrative aide. Internships and independent studies do not count toward the French major, except with special permission of the department. honors Program Eligibility A student must spend a minimum of three full semesters in residence at the College of Arts and Science. Attendance at NYU Paris counts toward such residence. The student must maintain an overall GPA of at least 3.65 and a major average of 3.65 or higher. Students who wish to pursue honors should apply to the depart- mental director of honors during their junior year. Requirements for Honors Completion of all major requirements (above). In addition to enrollment in a Senior Seminar (FREN-UA 991, 992), candidates for French honors must also enroll in Honors Thesis (FREN-UA 995), a 4-point course taken over both semesters of the senior year (2 points in the fall, 2 points in the spring). This Honors Thesis course sequence cannot count toward completion of the credit requirements for the French major. The honors thesis should be a work of scholarship and/or criticism in the field of French or Francophone literature or culture. The thesis is ordinarily written in French (25 pages minimum); exceptionally, students may petition to write it in English (40 to 60 pages). The seminar professor and the thesis adviser determine based on this work and an oral defense whether to recommend the student for an honors degree. A grade of at least A-minus is required for the award of honors in French.222 FRENCH C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF FRENCH accelerated B. a./m.a. Program in f rench or f rench Studies The Department of French and the Institute of French Studies offer qualified students the opportunity to earn the B.A. and M.A. degrees in a shortened period of study. While still undergraduates, students enrolled in the program may earn up to 12 points toward the M.A. by completing three graduate courses in the Department of French or at the Institute of French Studies. To earn advanced standing, these points may not be counted toward an undergraduate degree, and must be in excess of the 128 points required for the B.A. Under normal circumstances, this can be achieved by students who register for the maximum allowable number of points in their senior year. Earned in this manner, advanced standing has the additional advantage of enabling qualified students to start graduate work at an earlier stage and in the most cost-efficient way. Admission to the program is open to students who have completed between 48 and 96 credits with an overall GPA of at least 3.5 and a GPA of 3.5 or higher in the major. Application to the program can be made through the director of undergraduate studies in the Department of French. Final acceptance into the graduate sequence of the program is contingent on successful completion of the B.A., formal admission into the Graduate School of Arts and Science, and acceptance of the student's application. For more information on the B.A./M.A. in French studies, please consult www.ifs.as.nyu.edu/object/ifs.bama. facilities The University has two special facilities for students of French.

Examines how the famous Cairo Geniza documents illuminate Jewish economic life, and how the realities of economic life affected developments in the halakha. Also considers the organization and functions of the Jewish com- munity, with its foundations in the Geonic period. Through a discussion of the problem of adjudication we will address the large problem of how much autonomy the Jews actually had. Where relevant, comparisons will be drawn with the situation of the Jews in medieval Latin Europe. In addition to discussion of secondary readings, classes will focus on the close reading of seminal primary sources in English translation. Israeli Politics in Comparative Perspective HBRJD-UA 711 Offered every two years. 4 points. One of the most characteristic themes in Israeli politics is that of Israel's uniqueness, in its security needs, in its cultural and political identity, and in its relationship to the international community. This widespread perception of separateness readily contributes to and is at least partially constituted by the state's history of strategic insecurity and political isolation in the Middle East as well as its characteris- tic form of democratic governance. Objective (and a central methodological concern of political science) is to critically examine the assumption of Israel as a \"case apart\" and to degree to which Israel's \"unique\" characteristics may be understood as \"normal\" politics in the world at large. In doing so, we seek both to better understand the Israeli case and to explore diverse paths to conflict resolution. Attempts to address the growing interest in comparative analysis of Middle Eastern politics, with a focus on the State of Israel.SkIRBALL DEPARTMENT OF HEBREW AND JUDAIC S TUDIES 257 HEBREW AND JUDAIC S TUDIES C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYIsraeli T erritorial Politics: Between Security & Identity HBRJD-UA 712 Prerequisite: general knowledge of contemporary Israeli/Middle Eastern politics.

Is there a \"natural\" fit between the sexes and the pacifist or military impulse? This question has been at the core of the discourse about women and peace ever since its inception in the 19th-century European peace movements. This course traces the history of this debate, placing it within the general theoretical discussion over essentialism versus social and cultural constructivism (or, more commonly, \"nature\" versus \"nurture\"). Readings include fiction, poetry, and essays by activists and theorists alike, from Europe, America, and the Middle East. Independent Study HBRJD-UA 997, 998 Open to honors and nonhonors students.

Through a wide range of courses, students are exposed to a polyphony of viewpoints that help elucidate the historical and political experiences of Byzantine, Ottoman, and modern Greece; the ways in which Greece has borne its several pasts and translated them into the modern era; Greece and its relations to Western Europe, the Balkans, the Middle East, and Mediterranean cultures; and the distinguished literary and artistic traditions of a country that many regard as the birthplace of Western civilization, even as these traditions exhibit their multicultural contexts. NYU's Arts and Science summer program in Athens combines classroom study of the language, history, and culture of Greece with extracurricular activities and excursions that introduce students to all aspects of Greek life. The program offers a wide range of courses on such subjects as the Greek language, Greek literature and photogra- phy, Greek drama, Greek political history, the city of Athens, and the archaeology of Greece. Classes are held at the Al Andar Center, a three-story Bauhaus building located in the historical center of Athens. Activities include walking tours of Athens, visits to monuments and museums, and evening outings to dramatic and musical perfor- mances. Weekend excursions include trips to several Greek islands and to important historical and archaeological sites.

It is also a method of thinking characterized by its attention to the contexts in which people have lived and worked. By mastering this method of thinking, students of history gain invaluable skills and knowledge. They learn to analyze and interpret many different kinds of evidence (cultural, social, economic, and politi-cal) as well as to organize it into a coherent whole and present it clearly and with style in written or oral form. In doing so, students also learn to justify and question their own and others' conclusions, for history is always an argument about what actually happened. Indeed, rethinking and revising accepted historical conclusions is one of the most important\u2014and most interesting\u2014tasks of the historian. Notable among the department's areas of strength are American urban, social, labor, and ethnic history; medieval, early modern, and modern European history; Latin American history; sub-Saharan African his- tory; early and modern Asian History; and American and European women's history. The department also pays particular attention to the transnational and global aspects of the discipline. At the core of the undergraduate experience are Historical Interpretation (HIST-UA 101) and the capstone seminar. In Historical Interpretation 101, students learn about the practice of history through both lectures and an intense workshop experience. In the capstone seminar, usually taken in the senior year, students research and write an original paper (typically 20-25 pages). Through independent study and the honors program, students may find challenging opportunities for special concentrations and individual research. The internship program enables students to engage in supervised historical projects for credit. Many of the projects are at cultural institutions in New York and at the United Nations. The University's Elmer Holmes Bobst Library is rich in works of history, and students also utilize the collections of the New York Public Library, the historical societies and museums in New York City, and neighboring universities.DEPARTMENT OF History263 HISTORY C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF HISTORY major The major requires a minimum of nine 4-point courses (36 points) with a grade of C or better in each course. All majors must take Historical Interpretation (HIST-UA 101). The remaining eight courses are to be distributed among three fields of history\u2014U.S., European, and non-Western (Latin American, Near Eastern, African, and Asian)\u2014so that the student will complete at least two courses in each field. Students must also take one capstone seminar (HIST-UA 400-499; prerequisite: HIST-UA 101). One course must be in a period before 1800. No student may take more than three introductory courses (numbered below HIST-UA 100). Note that transfer students must take at least five history courses (20 points) in this department. Certain courses in the College Core Curriculum may also count toward the history major as introductory courses. These are Texts and Ideas and Cultures and Contexts, if they are taught by professors in the Department of History. Also, majoring in history exempts students from taking the Societies and the Social Sciences compo- nent of the Core Curriculum. T wo Liberal Studies courses, Social Foundations I and II, may count toward the major and fulfill the pre- 1800 and a European requirement. No other LS courses may count toward the major. These courses count as introductory. Global Public Health/History Major The global public health/history major provides a unique opportunity to unite the study of human experience in relation to particular times and places with the study of health of populations around the world. The major draws on the expertise of the CAS Department of History in providing students with the tools needed to ana- lyze and interpret many different kinds of evidence\u2014cultural, social, economic, and political\u2014and to organize them into a coherent whole, presented clearly in written or oral form. Students will study a variety of topics, such as environmental history, ethnicity, sexuality, epidemiology, health policy, gender, and social movements. NYU's global public health/history major provides a unique set of skills that may be applied in a variety of careers including law, teaching, public health, business, film, international affairs, and medicine and science. This major requires fifteen 4-point courses (60 points) with a grade of C or better, as follows.

Program264 HISTORY C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF HISTORY minor The minor requires at least four 4-point courses (16 points), of which three courses (12 points) must be taken in the Department of History. No more than 4 points may be taken in introductory-level courses. Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, and other advanced standing credit does not count toward the minor. Note: Students should consult the director of undergraduate studies for possible minor programs, course offer- ings, and course descriptions. A complete listing of history courses currently offered may be found in the current class schedule available on the department website. honors Program Students with strong academic records (a GPA of 3.65 in history and 3.65 overall) may apply to the director of undergraduate studies for admission to the history honors program. Students must be declared history majors or have already taken Historical Interpretation (HIST-UA 101) to apply for the program. This two-course, 8-point program affords qualified students the opportunity to work closely with faculty mem- bers and to conduct extensive research on a topic of their choice. The program is completed in two consecutive semesters. It is possible to take the history honors sequence beginning in either the fall or spring terms. The sequences run (1) spring to fall or (2) fall to spring, and this model accommodates students graduating in either December or May. The program consists of a small Honors Seminar (HIST-UA 994), followed by an individualized Honors T utorial (HIST-UA 996). The Honors Seminar (which satisfies the capstone seminar requirement for the major) is taken in the first semester of the sequence. In the seminar, students define a thesis topic of their choice, develop a bib-liography, read broadly in background works, and begin their research. A substantial part of the research, usually including a rough draft of the thesis, should be completed by the semester's end. The Honors T utorial, in which students work one-on-one with a faculty director, follows in the second semester of the sequence. The honors thesis varies in length from 40 to 70 pages, depending on the nature and scope of the subject. The completed thesis, approved for defense by the director, is defended before a committee consisting of the director and at least one additional faculty member. A grade of at least A-minus on the thesis is required for the award of honors in history. Students who receive a lower passing grade are simply awarded 8 points toward the major. Study a way The NYU history department encourages undergraduate history majors and minors to study away during the fall or spring semester of their junior year. Studying away at one of New York University's many international or domestic academic centers affords students the invaluable opportunity to pursue the discipline of history in an alternative academic and cultural setting. Studying away can help open doors to the discovery of unexpected areas of interest, as well as provide new insight about already established historical perspectives and research topics. Some courses offered by NYU for study away, as well as other approved programs outside NYU, may be eligible for inclusion into the history major. History majors should consult the director of undergraduate studies and the global programs administrator before making plans to study away. Some of the following designated courses are offered in other departments and are cross-listed with the Department of History, as indicated below. For the most up-to-date information on courses, please check the schedules on the department's website. required c ourse for h istory m ajors Historical Interpretation HIST-UA 101 Offered every semester. 4 points.

The myths and realities of the \"Golden Age of Piracy.\" The emergence of Spain as a political and economic superpower in the early sixteenth century bred waves of French, English, and Dutch interlopers, contraband slave traders, seaborne raiders, freebooters, and privateers eager to thwart her attempt at hegemony and expropriate her wealth. Their success gave rise to a multinational and cross-cultural underworld of violence and crime on the high seas that flourished nearly unchecked from the mid-seventeenth century until its suppression in the early decades of the eighteenth century.

Autobiographies and travel memoirs will occasion-ally provide additional questions about the quest for historical veracity. Should historians be skeptical of historical fiction? What might fictional histories be able to do that scholarly historical studies cannot? How trustworthy are travelogues and autobiography, or is that even a good question to ask about such writings? Authors of fiction whom we will read include Amin Maalouf, Tariq Ali, Orhan Pamuk, and Ivo Andric; and Sattareh Farman Farmaian.272 HISTORY C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF HISTORY Africa Since 1940 HIST-UA 567 Identical to SCA-UA 791.

Argues that the origin of some key conflicts in postcolonial Africa are to be found in the continent's past while others have grown out of the post-Cold War era. Environmental History of New York City HIST-UA 596 Offered every other year. Needham. 4 points. Investigates topics from the seventeenth century to the present. From the city's origins as a harbor city at the intersection of the Hudson River and the Atlantic, to the Manhattan bedrock that anchors modern skyscrapers, natural geography has determined urban possibility.

A vast and varied region stretching from the Great Plains to the Pacific Ocean, the West has both been characterized by its diversity and bound together by a shared regional identity and history. Beginning on the eve of European expansion in the 17th century, but concentrating on the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, focuses on the historical processes that have defined the West and its place within the United States. Debates over access to land, natural resource management, federal power, racial and ethnic diversity, and the public good are central to western history.

Indians, Empires, and Nations in North America HIST-UA 663 Offered every other year. Montoya, St. John. 4 points. A rapidly expanding and vibrant field, borderlands history focuses on the interactions of peoples, nations, and empires across the boundaries of Mexico, the United States, and Canada. Beginning with the earliest European claims to the continent, we explore recent writings on the interactions of Europeans and Native peoples as Spain, Britain, and France attempted to conquer North America. Also considers the transition from empires to nation-states in North America and explores how Mexico, the United States, and Canada worked to assert state power and create national space and citizens in the borderlands between nations. War Films and American History HIST-UA 665 Offered every other year. Sammons. 4 points. How visual representations of war in various media and genres have influenced, challenged, and, in some ways, transformed national identity and citizenship in the United States. War films do more than tell stories and entertain audiences. Films convey the social values and the mores of the period in which they are produced and address attitudes not only toward war, but also toward top-ics closely associated with war, such as the morality of fighting, the justness of war, the definition of heroism, and the responsibility of the individual to exhibit ethical behavior. U.S. History in Transnational and Global Perspective HIST-UA 667 Prerequisite: at least one college course in American history. Offered every year. Bender. 4 points. Reframes American history, placing major events into the context of transnational and global history and showing that we share more history with the rest of the world than notions of American \"exceptionalism\" allow.

Consumption and Consumer Culture in Comparative Perspective HIST-UA 671 Offered every other year. Nolan. 4 points. Readings range from the seventeenth to the twenti- eth century and focus primarily, but not exclusively, on Europe and the United States. Topics include the production and consumption of particular com- modities; middle-class and working-class consumer cultures in the nineteenth century; and mass produc- tion and mass consumption in the twentieth century. We examine protests and popular movements organized around issues of consumption; examine how products from the non-European world trans- formed European and American consumption; and how European, and especially American, patterns of consumption shaped consumption elsewhere. Reading and Writing Experimental History HIST-UA 672 Hodes. 4 points. Investigates and evaluates the ways in which scholars attempt to expand the boundaries of writing history. Focuses on the relationship between historical evidence and the writing of history in new ways; relation between scholar and subject; connections between history and speculation; use of 275 HISTORY C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF HISTORY unconventional voices; re-creation of past worlds and lives; and connections between history and storytelling.

Women, the Entertainment Industry, and the Blacklist Era HIST-UA 695 Offered every year. 4 points. One of the darker epochs of American history were the years most commonly known as the McCarthy era, although the senator from Wisconsin played only a small part in the investigations of the enter-tainment industry. History also chooses to remember only the men whenever discussions of this period are presented. Long forgotten, more accurately ignored, many women in entertainment were named and appeared before the various Un-American Activities Committees from 1938-1958. We examine an important piece of the American story through a new lens, giving a fascinating group of women their place in the history of this period. Sport and Film in American History HIST-UA 698 Offered every year. Sammons. 4 points. Investigates how a visual medium (film), subject to the conventions of drama and fiction, and a popular activity/institution (sport), often associated with frivolity, violence, and puerility, might be used as serious vehicles for conceptualizing and analyzing the past. Cold War in Asia HIST-UA 709 Identical to EAST-UA 552. Offered every fall semester. 4 points. Focuses on U.S. foreign policy in Asia since 1945. The ways U.S. global interests and concerns sought to shape Asian realities (and were shaped in turn by them) will be the touchstone for examining the Cold War in Asia.

The war is dealt with in two senses: its meaning for Japan's international history and its impact on the domestic landscape. Readings are drawn from both primary and secondary sources so that interpretative controversies as well as texts may be discussed. Six main themes: (1) the great debates over Japanese fascism and ultranationalism; (2) the China War; (3) the Pacific War; (4) the Coprosperity Sphere; (5) the atom bomb, surrender, and occupation; and (6) issues of public memory and war responsibility.

Course themes include Andean regional and cultural identity; ecology and peasant agriculture; native society and the Inca; colonialism, nationalism, and race; global commodity production (from silver to coca) and economic dependency; and Indian and working-class political struggles. The Peruvian novelist and ethnographer Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Arguedas is taken as an exemplary figure whose life, work, and death provide a focus connecting diverse elements in the course. Cuba: History and Revolution HIST-UA 755 Ferrer. 4 points. Cuba was one of the first territories colonized by Spain and among the last to secure its independence. It was among the last territories in the hemisphere to abolish slavery, yet home to the first black political party in the Americas. Its struggle for independence from Spain helped usher in an age of U.S. imperial- ism. It is the hemisphere's first and last socialist state. This brief description hints not only at the complexi- ties of Cuban history but also at its significance for international histories of nationalism and imperial-ism, race and slavery, the Cold War and socialist revolution. In-depth focus on the major themes that have shaped modern Cuban history in the 19th and 20th centuries: race and slavery, nationalism and imperialism, reform and revolution. Particular attention is paid to the revolution of 1959. Histories of the U.S.-Mexico Border HIST-UA 756 Offered periodically. St. John. 4 points. The border between the United States and Mexico is both a meeting ground and a dividing line between two nations, cultures, and people. It has been a site of conflict and coexistence from the time it was cre- ated until the present. In the media the border most often appears as a site of controversy, violence, and national control that is defined by U.S. and Mexican policies concerning trade, immigration, and national security. But the border is more than this; it is a place where individuals, families, and communities have made their lives. The history of the border then is found not only in the pages of government reports and statistics, but in the memories, songs, and stories of border people. History of the Caribbean HIST-UA 759 Offered every year. Ferrer. 4 points. The Antilles and the Guianas, from the arrival of Columbus to the present.

The program recognizes the changing nature of the contemporary political and economic environment and seeks to lay an interdisciplinary basis for understanding these changes. It provides students with an opportunity to study the complex web of transnational politics in an in-depth, interdisciplinary fashion. The breadth of courses is designed to match the breadth of knowledge and skills that the field requires. Fluency in a foreign language and a semester of study away are required of all majors to help ensure that they acquire a deeper understanding of a country's culture and institutions. In their junior or senior year, majors are also encouraged, though not required, to take advantage of the many internship opportunities that are available in New York City to students of international relations.280 INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYMAJOR IN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS Both external and internal transfer students should meet with the IR undergraduate student adviser (in the Department of Politics) to have their records reviewed and to receive a preliminary assessment of their prospects of being admitted to this major. major As this is an honors major, it is expected that students will maintain a GPA of 3.65 or better throughout their time as a major and complete an honors thesis in their senior year. All majors must complete a total of fourteen 4-point courses (56 points). They must complete four core courses, plus four courses in the international relations environment and two courses in a regional specialization. Students must also demonstrate proficiency in a foreign language (two courses past the intermediate level) and complete a semester in a study away program. Finally, students must complete the two-course senior honors sequence. Core Courses All international relations majors must take the following (advanced standing credits are not accepted): Introduction to Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 1) Introduction to Microeconomics (ECON-UA 2) International Politics (POL-UA 700) One course in statistics chosen from: Statistics (ECON-UA 18) Quantitative Methods in Political Science (POL-UA 800) Statistics for the Behavioral Sciences (PSYCH-UA 10) Statistics for Social Research (SOC-UA 302) International Relations Environment See under course offerings.

These courses are normally taken during the term away. Whether taken at Washington Square or away, both courses must be approved in advance by the program direc- tor or the undergraduate adviser for IR. Foreign Language Students satisfy this requirement by completing two courses beyond the intermediate level. It is recommended that the language be related to the regional specialization and/or the study away site (but not, for example, if the site is London), but it is not required. We encourage students who are already fluent in English and another language to study an additional language at the advanced level. If a student considers himself or herself fluent in a foreign language, he or she can 1) complete the requirement with a third language or 2) take two advanced courses (literature or advanced translation) in the foreign language of the student's fluency. In either case, the student would have to take the two courses past the intermediate level.

The study of Irish society and culture provides students with an understanding of Ireland's historical experience: its colonial past; its contribution to literature, both medieval and modern; its far-reaching effect in the modern world through its diaspora; and its dual language tradition and rival national narratives. The Irish studies minor at NYU offers an interdisciplinary program providing students with the oppor- tunity to study and pursue directed research in the history and culture of Ireland and Irish America, exploring such areas as literature, history, drama, politics, art, cinema studies, music, and the Irish language. A faculty of internationally renowned scholars is supplemented by the regular presence of promi- nent visiting professors. In addition to the program at Washington Square, the Arts and Science summer program in Dublin gives students the opportunity to study in Ireland. Through the generosity of Lewis L. and Loretta Brennan Glucksman, two landmark houses in Washington Mews were renovated to serve as the home for Ireland House. Since its official opening in 1993, Glucksman Ireland House has become one of the most vibrant centers of Irish and Irish American arts and learning in North America. It offers a lively array of programs that are free to students, including evening courses, public lectures, conferences, films, exhibits, and readings.284 IRISH S TUDIES C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYMINOR IN IRISH S TUDIES If accepted, B.A./M.A. candidates will take a graduate course, Irish Studies Seminar I, in the fall semester of their senior year.

We want to educate those who agree. Opportunities abound in the media world, but the opportunity to do compelling work that informs, engages\u2014and matters\u2014is what drives our faculty, motivates our students, and informs our entire approach. Great journalism has always come from the great cities of the globe, and there is no better place to learn the craft than the city of New York\u2014where power and wealth concentrate, news and culture originate, and daily events fascinate. The institute immerses students in the richness and vitality of the city, while attracting to campus many of the leaders and thinkers in the journalism profession. New York City is our laboratory\u2014and our inspira- tion. The very first lesson we offer students is this: Tap into it, with our help. Every day, students move outward from the classroom to the city, on assignments that take them all over town. The full-time faculty is itself of national stature in the journalism world. As writers, reporters, produc- ers, and critics, NYU professors continue to practice the journalism they teach and preach, holding the profession to its highest standards of public service. Course work begins with the basic skills of reporting, writing, and research, but simultaneously students are taught what journalism at its best can be\u2014and what it should accomplish in a free and democratic society. They are also encouraged to publish their work, with assignments, internships, and online projects geared to this end. Housed within the arts and sciences core of a leading university, the institute sees journalism as an essential strand in the liberal arts tradition and a critical factor in public culture. But we also recognize that news these days is a business. When our skilled graduates enter that business, they are prepared to improve and enliven it. Institute facilities include seven state-of-the-art newsrooms, broadcast production facilities, and an array of multimedia equipment, including video cameras, still cameras, digital recorders, and all that is necessary in a rapidly changing news environment.Arthur L.

Latino Politics in the U.S. SCA-UA 542 4 points. Examines the history, status, and political behavior of Latinos as a minority group in the U.S. politi-cal system. Historical analysis of Latino political incorporation, followed by examination of the various activities and efforts to gain political power and influence. Examines identity-based social move- ments of the 1960s and '70s, depictions of Latinos as a pan-ethnic voting bloc during the 1980s, and the politics of transnationalism, globalization, and immigration today. Utilizes case studies, historical and theoretical monographs, primary documents, and recent poll data surveying Latino political behavior and opinions. Latin Music from Rumba to Reggaeton SCA-UA 543 4 points. Studies the range of styles, movements and practices of U.S. Latin music in historical perspective. Looks closely at selected musical texts and practitioners but primary emphasis is on understanding the social contexts and cultural/political significance of chang- ing musical practices during the course of the 20th century and down to the present. To what extent do these instances of collective artistic taste reflect struggles to affirm ethnic and racial identities? What has been the historical relationship between these styles and the development of popular music in the United States? How are gender, racial, and class rela- tions reflected in and expressed through the music? Class Warfare SCA-UA 545 4 points. Examines how class conflict plays out in interna-tional and institutional settings or \"complexes\" of present-day society, such as neo-liberal politics, incarceration, educational apartheid, and mass deportation of immigrants.

A seminar on contemporary cultural production by Latina feminist artists. Close study of rigorous scholarship offering different theoretical /critical perspectives for interpreting cultural objects as social and political texts, and careful examination of film, fiction, poetry, visual, and performance art. Recurrent tropes and themes include: the border- lands as geographical and psychic boundary; the \"mestiza\" or \"mulata\" body as racism and educa- tion; revolution and political violence; the literature of exile; the figure of the Malinche/La Llorona as race traitor or victim; and the domestic/maquiladora worker as virgin or whore. Consideration of racial politics within post-nationalist movements for social justice. Globalization, Immigration, and Postcolonial Identity SCA-UA 560 4 points. Investigates why people migrate to the \"First World\" in general (and the U.S. specifically) through economic, sociological, anthropological, cultural, and literary readings. How is the \"First World,\" and particularly the U.S., implicated in migration from the \"Third\"? What compels people to migrate? Do efforts to \"develop\" the Third World, such as NAFTA, affect migration? How do waves of the globalization of labor and consumer markets effect U.S .culture? Are we currently paying the price for mistakes in foreign policies in the 1980s and economic policies of the 1990s? Revolutionary Culture of the Americas SCA-UA 561 4 points. Examines the U.S. both as a model for revolution and as a neocolonial power that became the object of revolutionary opposition. Considers shared political visions and intellectual exchanges among revolution- ary intellectuals in the U.S. and Latin America.

Examines the profound sociological and cultural implications of the growing Afro-Latino presence in light of recent theoretical work on race and diasporas. Overview of the historical background of African-descended peoples in the Spanish-speaking Americas and of the longstanding social experience of black Latinos in the United States. Considers migration patterns, community formation, and narrative accounts of Afro-Latino life and traditions of cultural expression. Special attention to Afro- Latino poetry and to the rich history of Afro-Latino music through the generations. Possible theoretical and political consequences of this increasingly self- conscious transnational identity formation. Nationalism and Development in U.S. Literature, 1850-1950 SCA-UA 568 4 points. Close reading of fiction foregrounding U.S. slavery, western expansion, industrialization, and imperialist adventure as modes of primitive accumulation that contributed to the foundation of the United States as a \"developed\" nation. Authors offer anti-imperialist, feminist, and minoritarian critiques of this history of U.S. national development. Postmodern Travel Fictions SCA-UA 572 4 points. A study of travel narratives by post-World War II authors/filmmakers of the Americas. Investigates the legacy of colonialism; the concept of \"freedom\" embodied in travel writing and the ideology of con- quest engraved in historical memory; the gendered dynamic of travel writing; and literary representation (and the perpetuation of) racialized myths about North and South America.

The requirements are as follows: One core course, chosen from: Law and Society (LWSOC-UA 1, section 001), cross-listed with politics (POL-UA 335) Law and Society (LWSOC-UA 1, section 002), cross-listed with sociology (SOC-UA 413) One course in Research Methods (SOC-UA 301, or another methods course with approval of law and society director) Three elective courses (see under course offerings for a list of approved electives). Students may petition the director to have other courses count toward the elective requirement. Students who declared a minor in law and society prior to fall 2013 are not required to take Research Methods (SOC-UA 301); they may take a fourth elective instead. Students who are majoring in sociology must take Research Methods for their major; they may also take a fourth elective instead. With special permission, exceptional students may be allowed, in their senior year and in consultation with the director, to substitute one of the following for one of the three elective courses: (1) an independent study culminating in a research paper or project, (2) an apprenticeship with a faculty member doing relevant research (with permission of faculty), or (3) a relevant graduate course (with permission of faculty). Courses applied to this minor cannot be double-counted toward a major or another minor. The pass/fail option is not acceptable for the law and society minor.Professor emeritus Heydebrand Professors Benton (History), Bruner (Psychology; Law), Garland (Sociology; Law), Gordon (History), Greenberg (Sociology), Haney (Sociology; Director, Law and Society), Harrington (Politics; Law), Harvey (Politics), Jost (Psychology), k ornhauser (Law), Lukes (Sociology), Merry (Anthropology; Law and Society), Myers (Anthropology), Persico (Economics; Law and Society), Schieffelin (Anthropology)associate Professors Dixon (Sociology), Fahmy (Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies), Rizzo (Economics), Solomon (Journalism)director Professor Lynne Haneywww. sociology.as.nyu.edu 295 Lafayette Street, 4th Floor, New York, NY 10012 Phone: 212-998-8340 A number of the liberal arts disciplines in the College of Arts and Science provide important perspectives on law and the legal profession. The law and society minor, administered by the Department of Sociology, offers undergraduates a meaningful cluster of these courses. The requirement of five courses allows this interdisciplinary minor to be substantial; the inclusion of a core course enhances its coherence. In addition, the minor gives capable and ambitious students attractive opportunities to pursue advanced or specialized study. While prelaw students may well wish to take it, this minor is not aimed specifically at them. Students wishing to declare this minor should see Jamie Lloyd, academic administrator for the Department of Sociology, 295 Lafayette Street, Room 4168.PROGRAM IN Law and Society core c ourses Law and Society LWSOC-UA 1.001 Identical to POL-UA 335.

These must include the following: One introductory course: either Language (LING-UA 1) or Language and Mind (LING-UA 3, formerly 28) Sound and Language (LING-UA 11) Grammatical Analysis (LING-UA 13) Phonological Analysis (LING-UA 12) Introduction to Semantics (LING-UA 4) One of the following: Language and Society (LING-UA 15); African American English I: Language and Culture (LING-UA 23); Language in Latin America (LING-UA 30); or Pidgin and Creole Languages (LING-UA 38) Three courses freely chosen from the offerings of the department It is highly recommended that majors and joint majors begin with the first three requirements above, since other courses have these as prerequisites or generally presuppose their content. Note that Sound and Language (LING-UA 11) is only taught in the fall; it is a prerequisite for Phonological Analysis (LING-UA 12), which is also required for the major.ProgramfacUl TYProfessor emerita Umeda Silver Professor; Professor Collins, Costello, Champollion, Gallagherglobal distinguished Professor f aculty Buchwald (Speech and Language Pathology and Audiology), Fine (Philosophy), Levi (Steinhardt), Marcus (Psychology), McElree (Psychology), Poeppel (Psychology), Schieffelin (Anthropology), Schiffer (Philosophy), v ouloumanos (Psychology)chair of the department Professor Barker director of Undergraduate Studies Professor SinglerLinguistics is the science of human language. It seeks to determine that which is necessary in human lan- guage, that which is possible, and that which is impossible. While linguists work to determine the unique qualities of individual languages, they are constantly searching for linguistic universals\u2014properties whose explanatory power reaches across languages. The discipline of linguistics is organized around syntax (the principles by which sentences are organized), morphology (the principles by which words are constructed), semantics (the study of meaning), phonetics (the study of speech sounds), phonology (the sound pat- terns of language), historical linguistics (the ways in which languages change over time), sociolinguistics (the interaction of language with society), psycholinguistics, and neurolinguistics (the representation of language in the brain). Current research by faculty members extends across the field, including topics in the interaction of syntax and semantics, phonetics and phonology, languages in contact, pidgin and creole languages, urban sociolinguistics, and computer analogies of syntactic processes.DEPARTMENT OF Linguistics316 LINGUISTICS C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF LINGUISTICS No grade lower than C (or course taken pass/fail) may be counted toward the major or toward a joint major. If any course is used to fulfill the major or minor requirements of any other department or program at NYU, it may not be used simultaneously to fulfill the requirements for any of the linguistics majors. All linguistics majors, joint majors, and combined majors must select and register for linguistics courses with the advice of the director of undergraduate studies in the linguistics department. Joint m ajors with a f oreign l anguage The Department of Linguistics offers joint majors with the Departments of French, German, Italian, and Spanish and Portuguese. The major with Spanish requires a total of ten 4-point courses (40 points); the majors with the other languages require a total of nine 4-point courses (36 points). The linguistics portion of the joint foreign language majors is satisfied by taking the following five courses (20 points): One introductory course: either Language (LING-UA 1) or Language and Mind (LING-UA 3, formerly 28) Sound and Language (LING-UA 11) Grammatical Analysis (LING-UA 13) A total of two additional courses from two different fields of linguistics, chosen from the following: Historical linguistics (LING-UA 14, LING-UA 17, Psycholinguistics (LING-UA 5, LING-UA 43, LING-UA 54) The foreign language portion of the joint major is satisfied as follows.

Students may apply one advanced conversation course toward the major. Note that Advanced Grammar and Composition (SPAN-UA 100) does not count toward the major; this course (or equivalent, or placement) is a prerequisite for entering the major. Joint m ajor in a nthropology and l inguistics The joint major in anthropology and linguistics emphasizes the complementary nature of anthropological and sociolinguistic approaches to language. Students are required to take 20 points (five 4-point courses) each from the Department of Anthropology and the Department of Linguistics. A grade of at least C is required in every course for it to be counted toward the joint major. Required courses in anthropology are: Human Society and Culture (ANTH-UA 1) Anthropology of Language (ANTH-UA 17) Either Cultural Symbols (ANTH-UA 48) or Language, Power, and Identity (ANTH-UA 16) T wo other cultural or linguistic anthropology courses approved by the director of undergraduate studies in the Department of Anthropology.

Joint m ajor in l anguage and m ind This major, intended as an introduction to cognitive science, is administered by the Departments of Linguistics, Philosophy, and Psychology. Ten courses (40 points) are required (four in linguistics, one in philosophy, four in psychology, and one additional course). The linguistics component consists of these four courses: Language and Mind (LING-UA 3, formerly 28) T wo courses chosen from the following:318 LINGUISTICS C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF LINGUISTICS Introduction to Semantics (LING-UA 4) Phonological Analysis (LING-UA 12) [Note that Sound and Language (LING-UA 11) is a prereq- uisite for Phonological Analysis and is only offered in the Fall Semester.] Grammatical Analysis (LING-UA 13) One course, chosen from the following: Introduction to Semantics (LING-UA 4) Psycholinguistics (LING-UA 5) Sound and Language (LING-UA 11) Computational Principles of Sentence Construction (LING-UA 24) Form, Meaning, and the Mind (LING-UA 31) Propositional Attitudes (LING-UA 35) Neural Bases of Language (LING-UA 43 or PSYCH-UA 300) Linguistics as Cognitive Science (LING-UA 48) Learning to Speak (LING-UA 54) Introduction to Morphology at an Advanced Level (LING-UA 55) The philosophy component is a choice of one of the following three courses: Minds and Machines (PHIL-UA 5) Logic (PHIL-UA 70) Philosophy of Language (PHIL-UA 85) The psychology component consists of four courses: Statistics for the Behavioral Sciences (PSYCH-UA 10) Cognition (PSYCH-UA 29) One course chosen from among the following: The Psychology of Language (PSYCH-UA 56) Language Acquisition and Cognitive Development (PSYCH-UA 300) Neural Bases of Language (PSYCH-UA 300) Speech: A Window into the Developing Mind (PSYCH-UA 300) One course chosen from among the following: Perception (PSYCH-UA 22) Introduction to Cognitive Neuroscience (PSYCH-UA 25) Laboratory in Perception (PSYCH-UA 44) Laboratory in Human Cognition (PSYCH-UA 46) The Psychology of Language (PSYCH-UA 56) Language Acquisition and Cognitive Development (PSYCH-UA 300) Neural Bases of Language (PSYCH-UA 300) Speech: A Window into the Developing Mind (PSYCH-UA 300) The tenth course will be an additional course from the lists above that has not already been taken to satisfy the departmental components. Joint majors should consult with the respective directors of undergraduate studies of the participating departments. minor Four courses (16 points) in linguistics with a grade of C or better in each course. Courses taken pass/fail do not count. If any course is used to fulfill the major or minor requirements in any other department or program at NYU, it may not be used simultaneously to fulfill the requirements for the linguistics minor. recommended Work outside the d epartment To meet standards currently set in the linguistics field, as well as graduate school admission requirements, students majoring in linguistics are advised to gain competence in the following areas during their undergraduate studies: (1) one or more foreign languages, (2) psychology, for issues of language and the mind, and anthropol- ogy, for issues of language and culture, (3) mathematics or logic, for an understanding of modern algebra and 319 LINGUISTICS C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF LINGUISTICS mathematical logic, (4) philosophy of language, and (5) one or more computer languages. Majors and minors should avail themselves of the NYU study away programs. Note that any course substitution or transfer credit toward a required course for the major must be confirmed by a letter from the director of undergraduate studies. honors in l inguistics The Department of Linguistics offers an honors track. The requirement for graduation with honors in linguistics is an honors thesis of 40 to 50 pages, typically the culmination of a year's work, and two advanced courses chosen with the honors thesis adviser. Students who are excelling in the linguistics major are highly encouraged to develop an honors project as early as the second semester of their sophomore year. It is expected that students who pursue honors work in the Department of Linguistics have sufficient preparation and background (i.e., high-level coursework) in a field of linguistics, which is not always the case for students in the joint majors with French, German, Italian, and Spanish. Admission to the honors program is by application in the second semester of junior year. To be eligible, a student must have a GPA of 3.65 overall as well as in linguistics. Applications are due to the director of undergraduate studies by April 15 and must include a one- to two-page description of the topic that the student wishes to investigate in the senior thesis. The student must identify a faculty member in the Department of Linguistics who has agreed to supervise the project, and the description of the thesis is written in consultation with this faculty adviser. The student will be notified by May 1 about acceptance into the honors program. If the student is accepted, the faculty member who has agreed to supervise the student's honors thesis will become the student's honors adviser, and the two advanced courses for honors will be chosen jointly by the student and the adviser. Joint honors The Department of Linguistics offers joint honors in all programs for which it offers joint majors: language and mind, anthropology and linguistics, French and linguistics, German and linguistics, Italian and linguistics, and Spanish and linguistics. For the requirements of joint honors in anthropology and linguistics, students should see Professor John Singler. For the requirements of joint honors in language and mind, students should follow the same procedure for honors in linguistics, except that their proposal should identify faculty members from two departments in the language and mind major (linguistics, philosophy, and psychology), and these two faculty members will be co-advisers. The thesis topic must reflect contributions to both disciplines. Students interested in pursuing joint honors in linguistics and French, German, Italian, or Spanish should consult with the director of undergraduate studies in linguistics, as well as in the language department, in or before the second semester of their junior year. coUrSeS Language LING-UA 1 Offered every semester. Baltin, Champollion, Collins, Gallagher, Gouskova, Szabolcsi. 4 points. Nature or nurture? Linguistics is a science that system- atically addresses this puzzle, and it offers a uniquely interesting support for the answer: both. Language is a social phenomenon, but human languages share elaborate and specific structural properties. The conventions of speech communities exist, exhibit variation, and change within the strict confines of universal grammar, part of our biological endowment. Universal grammar is discovered through the careful study of the structures of individual languages, by cross-linguistic investigations, and the investigation of the brain. In this way, linguistics mediates between cognitive science and social science. Introduces some fundamental properties of the sound system and of the structure and interpretation of words and sentences, set into this larger context.320 LINGUISTICS C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF LINGUISTICS Language and Mind LING-UA 3 Formerly LING-UA 28. Identical to PSYCH-UA 27. Offered every year. Adriaans, Baltin, Davidson, Marantz, Marcus, McElree, Murphy, Pylkkanen, Szabolcsi. 4 points. Introduces students to the field of cognitive science through an examination of language behavior. Begins with interactive discussions of how best to characterize and study the mind. These principles are then illustrated through an examination of research and theories related to language representation and use. Draws from research in both formal linguistics and psycholinguistics. Introduction to Semantics LING-UA 4 Prerequisite: Language (LING-UA 1), Language and Mind (LING-UA 3, formerly 28), or permission of the instructor. Offered every year. Barker, Szabolcsi. 4 points. Focuses on the compositional semantics of sentences. Introduces set theory, propositional logic, and predicate logic as tools and goes on to investigate the empirical linguistic issues of presup-positions, quantification, scope, and polarity. Points out parallelisms between the nominal and the verbal domains. Introduction to Psycholinguistics LING-UA 5 Offered occasionally. Davidson. 4 points. We easily recognize printed and spoken words, understand novel and complex sentences, and produce fluent speech thousands of times each day. It is also remarkable that children seem to learn the sounds and structures of their native languages with little effort. Psycholinguistics aims to understand the mental processes that underlie both the representa-tion and acquisition of language. Topics covered include language acquisition, speech perception, lexical representation and access, sentence produc-tion, and the relationship between phonology and orthography. Sound and Language LING-UA 11 Offered every fall. Davidson, Gallagher, Gouskova, Guy. 4 points. Introduction to phonetic and phonological theory at an elementary level. Topics include the descrip- tion and analysis of speech sounds, the anatomy and physiology of speech, speech acoustics, and phonological processes. Students develop skills to distinguish and produce sounds used in the languages of the world and to transcribe them using the International Phonetic Alphabet.Phonological Analysis LING-UA 12 Prerequisite: Sound and Language (LING-UA 11) or permission of the instructor. Offered at least every spring. Davidson, Gallagher, Gouskova. 4 points. Introduction to phonology, the area of linguistics that investigates how languages organize sounds into highly constrained systems. The fundamental questions include the following: What do the sound systems of all languages have in common? How can they differ from each other? What is the nature of phonological processes, and why do they occur? Students develop analytical skills by solving phonological problems based on data from a wide variety of languages. Grammatical Analysis LING-UA 13 Prerequisite: Language (LING-UA 1), Language and Mind (LING-UA 3, formerly 28), or permission of the instructor. Offered at least every fall. Baltin, Collins, Harves. 4 points. What determines the sequencing of words in a given language? How can we explain word-order variation within and across languages? Are there universal syntactic properties common to the grammar of all languages? Presents the motivation for the modern generative approach to the scientific study of lan- guage and systematically develops a model that will account for the most basic syntactic constructions of natural language. Skills in scientific argumentation and reasoning are developed by analyzing problems in the syntax of English and a number of other languages. Language Change LING-UA 14 Offered every other year. Costello. 4 points. Introduces students to the methods of genealogi- cal classification and subgrouping of languages. Examines patterns of replacement in phonology, morphology, and syntax. Focuses on internal and comparative phonological, morphological, and syntactic reconstruction. Considers phonological developments such as Grimm's, Grassmann's, and Verner's Laws, in detail. Language and Society LING-UA 15 Identical to SCA-UA 701. Offered every fall. Guy, Singler. 4 points. Considers contemporary issues in the interaction of language and society, particularly work on speech variation and social structure. Focuses on ways in which social factors affect language. Topics include 321 LINGUISTICS C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF LINGUISTICS language as a social and political entity; regional, social, and ethnic speech varieties; bilingualism; and pidgin and creole languages. Grammatical Analysis II LING-UA 16 Prerequisite: Grammatical Analysis (LING-UA 13). Offered every other year. Harves. 4 points. A continuation of Grammatical Analysis, offering an in-depth examination of various topics in syntax. Introduces students to primary literature in syntactic theory in order to further develop their critical reading and writing skills so that they may carry out an independent research project of their own. Topics will vary from year to year and may include (but are not limited to) binding theory, control, case theory, constraints on movement, antisymmetry, argument structure and applicatives, ellipsis, and derivation by phase. The Indo-European Family LING-UA 17 Offered occasionally. Costello. 4 points. Presents the phonological and morphological systems of Proto-Indo-European and considers the development thereof in the major branches of the Indo-European family of languages, in particular Indic, Hellenic, Slavic, Italic, and Germanic. Bilingualism LING-UA 18 Offered every fall. Vrzic. 4 points. Examines bilingualism and multilingualism in New York City and around the world, at the level of the individual and of society. Considers the social forces that favor or inhibit bilingualism, as well as the edu- cational consequences of bilingual education (and of monolingual education for bilingual children). Also examines the impact of bilingualism on the languages involved. Special attention is paid to code switching, the practice of using two languages in a single speech event, with particular reference to its psycholinguistic and sociolinguistic aspects. Sex, Gender, and Language LING-UA 21 Identical to SCA-UA 712. Offered every spring. Vasvari. 4 points. Examines gender from a multidisciplinary perspec-tive and in particular as a sociolinguistic variable in speech behavior. How do linguistic practices both reflect and shape our gender identity, and how do these reflect more global socio-cultural relationships between the sexes? Do women and men talk differ- ently? To what degree do these differences seem to be universal or variable across cultures? How does gen- dered language intersect with race and class-linked language? What impact does gendered language have on the power relationships in given societies? Also examines gendered voices\u2014and silences\u2014in folklore and in literature. African American English I: Language and Culture LING-UA 23 Identical to SCA-UA 799. Offered every other year. Blake. 4 points. Introduces the language behavior of African Americans. Discusses African American Vernacular English in terms of its linguistic and cultural distinc- tiveness, both intrasystemically and in comparison with other dialects of American English. Relates the English vernacular spoken by African Americans in urban settings to creole languages spoken on the South Carolina Sea Islands (Gullah), in the Caribbean, and in West Africa. Also approaches the subject from the perspective of the history of the expressive uses of African American Vernacular English, and the educational, attitudinal, and social implications connected with the language. Computational Principles of Sentence Construction LING-UA 24 Prerequisite: Language (LING-UA 1) or Language and Mind (LING-UA 3, formerly 28). Offered every year. Barker, Dougherty. 4 points. Introduces students to the basic computational tools available for formulating linguistic and psycholin-guistic models of competence and performance. Discusses classical problems in perception and description of verb-particle constructions, questions, passives, and garden-path sentences. Considers how parsers operate in structurally different languages such as Chinese and English. Students learn sufficient computer skills (Unix, Lisp, and Prolog) to run public domain programs that model a human being's language production and perception capacities. Students obtain hands-on experience with artificial intelligence and expert systems programs using symbolic logical-based computer languages. They may base their research on existing programs or write their own. Languages in Contact LING-UA 25 Prerequisite: Language (LING-UA 1), Language and Mind (LING-UA 3, formerly 28), or permission of the instructor. Offered occasionally. Singler. 4 points. Presents a typology of contact, organized both by the nature of the contact and by its linguistic consequences. We consider the impact that contact 322 LINGUISTICS C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF LINGUISTICS can have on existing languages, and we pay special attention to the kind of contact that gives rise to new languages and also to the kind that kills languages. Topics include borrowing, bilingualism, language maintenance and language shift, language birth and language death, code switching, diglossia, pidginization and creolization, new Englishes, and mixed languages. Language and Liberation: At Home in the Caribbean and Abroad LING-UA 26 Identical to SCA-UA 163. Offered every other year. Blake. 4 points. Explores the linguistic and cultural transformations that took place in the Commonwealth Caribbean from 17th-century slavery and bond servitude to the present day. Focus is on the extent to which Caribbean people were given or demanded the freedom to create and maintain a postcolonial Caribbean identity. We first discuss the socio- historical conditions that led to the creation of new Caribbean languages called \"pidgins\" and \"creoles\" as the English language was transplanted from Britain to the Third World. We then explore the relationship of the English-based creoles to the social, cultural, political, and literary/expressive aspects of the contexts in which they existed and in which they continue to exist today in the Caribbean as well as in Britain and the United States. Grammatical Diversity LING-UA 27 Prerequisite: Grammatical Analysis (LING-UA 13) or permission of the instructor. Offered every year. Collins, Kayne. 4 points. Introduces the syntax of languages quite different from English, from various parts of the world. Considers what they may have in common with English and with each other and how to characterize the ways in which they differ from English and from each other. Communication: Men, Minds, and Machines LING-UA 28 Formerly LING-UA 3. Offered every year. Dougherty. 4 points. Examines signs and symbols in the communication of humans, primates, birds, computers, automata, simulata, and more and discusses definitions of such concepts as sign, symbol, intelligence, artificial intel- ligence, mind, cognition, and meaning. Concerns the matter expressed by the symbol systems and the manner in which the matter is expressed: literally, abstractly, metaphorically, as a simile, by insinuation, and other methods.Morphology LING-UA 29 Offered occasionally. Collins. 4 points. An introduction to the study of the internal structure of words. The two main problems in morphology are (1) how to account for the surface variability of formatives (allomorphy) and (2) how to account for their combinatorial properties (morphosyntax). Beginning from the techniques and problems of structuralist morpheme analysis, two major approaches to allomorphy are introduced: the morpheme-based model and the word-based model. In morphosyntax, we concentrate on the question of to what extent morphological combination is a matter of syntax versus the lexicon. Emphasis is on constructing morphological hypotheses and linguis- tic argumentation. The assignments involve in-depth analyses of data from various languages. Language in Latin America LING-UA 30 Offered every other year. Guy. 4 points. Considers the dialectology of Latin America: how and why American varieties of Spanish and Portuguese differ from European varieties, as well as the distribution and nature of dialect differences in different regions of the Americas. Examines sociolin- guistic issues, such as class and ethnic differences in Spanish and Portuguese in the Americas, the origin and development of standard and nonstandard varieties, and the effects of contact with Amerindian and African languages. Considers Spanish- and Portuguese-based creoles and the question of prior creolization in the popular speech of Brazil, Cuba, and other areas with a substantial population of African descent. Other topics include bilingualism, code switching, language attitudes, the impact of contact with English, and the present status of indigenous languages. Form, Meaning, and the Mind LING-UA 31 Prerequisites: Introduction to Semantics (LING-UA 4) and Grammatical Analysis (LING-UA 13), or permission of the instructor. Offered every other year. Baltin. 4 points. Deals with the relationship between cognitive organization on the one hand and the interaction between syntax and semantics in natural language. Focuses on the debate within cognitive science as to whether or not the mind is modular (divided into distinct faculties, such as language, vision, and perhaps others). Discusses the relationship of this debate to the debate within linguistics as to whether or not syntax is an autonomous component of a grammar that feeds semantics but does not depend 323 LINGUISTICS C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF LINGUISTICS on semantics itself for its functioning. Examines works in cognitive science about modularity and works in linguistics that bear on the question of the autonomy of syntax. Writing Systems of the World LING-UA 33 Offered occasionally. Costello. 4 points. Discusses how various writing systems relate to lan- guage and questions whether writing affects language (and if so, how). The fundamental characteristics of writing are discussed: the communicative purpose of writing, the application of graphical marks on a durable surface, and the achievement of communica-tion by virtue of the marks' conventional relation to language. The evolution of writing is traced. Students compare the writing systems that evolved in Central America, China, Sumer, and Egypt\u2014and their descendants\u2014with respect to their relative advantages and disadvantages, from the points of view of acquisition, the representation of language, and the effective achievement of communication. Propositional Attitudes LING-UA 35 Prerequisite: Philosophy of Language (PHIL-UA 85), Introduction to Semantics (LING-UA 4), or permission of the instructor. Offered occasionally. Barker. 4 points. Advanced seminar. Investigates the nature of linguistic meaning through an examination of the semantics of sentences that report beliefs and other attitudes toward propositions, such as \"Galileo believed that the earth moves.\" Such sentences have arguably proven problematic for all theories of meaning. We read and discuss pertinent papers by linguists and philosophers; background lectures are given on related issues, such as the semantics of proper names, pronouns, and demonstratives. Indo-European Syntax LING-UA 36 Offered occasionally. Costello. 4 points. Students are introduced to the study of comparative (Proto-)Indo-European syntax. Methods of recon-structing a protosyntax are presented and compared. Deals with recent explanations concerning the origin and development of a number of parts of speech, including adverbs and prepositions, and syntactic constructions, including absolute, relative, and periphrastic verbal constructions (for example, the passive) in Proto-Indo-European and its descendant languages. Reanalysis and grammaticalization are addressed in some detail. Questions concerning the motivation of innovations and their implications for the overall evolution of language are discussed.The Syntax/Semantics Interface: Hungarian LING-UA 37 Prerequisite: Grammatical Analysis (LING-UA 13) or permission of the instructor. Introduction to Semantics (LING-UA 4) is recom-mended but not required. Offered occasionally. Szabolcsi. 4 points. Hungarian is known as a language that wears its semantics on its syntactic sleeve. Word order transparently identifies the topic and the focus of the sentence and disambiguates the scopes of operators such as \"always,\" \"not,\" and \"everyone.\" Studies Hungarian from the perspective of theoreti- cal linguistics and asks what this language tells us about how the syntax/semantics interface works in universal grammar. Reviews the fundamentals of Hungarian morphology and syntax and discusses current literature. Not a language course. Pidgin and Creole Languages LING-UA 38 Prerequisite: Language (LING-UA 1), Language and Mind (LING-UA 3, formerly 28), or permission of the instructor. Offered every other year. Singler. 4 points. Examines the pidginized and creolized languages of the world. Addresses three central questions: (1) how pidgins/creoles (P/Cs) come into being, (2) why P/Cs have the properties they do, and (3) why P/Cs\u2014regardless of the circumstances of their genesis\u2014share so many features. Examines P/Cs vis-a-vis other types of languages, considers the linguistic and social factors that contribute to the genesis of individual P/Cs, and investigates the linguistic characteristics of P/Cs. Geographic focus is on the Atlantic (creoles from the Caribbean and pidgins from West Africa), but pidgins/creoles from the Pacific are also discussed. Language in Use LING-UA 41 Offered occasionally. Guy. 4 points. Living languages change across time. This course examines language not from the standpoint of abstract structural description but from the perspec-tive of how it is actively used in a speech community. We consider theoretical issues, such as how to model diversity in language use, and methodological issues, such as how to study language change while it is under way. We study appropriate quantitative methods for investigating variation across linguistic contexts, speakers, settings, and time. 324 LINGUISTICS C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF LINGUISTICS Romance Syntax LING-UA 42 Prerequisite: Grammatical Analysis (LING-UA 13) or permission of the instructor. Offered occasionally. Kayne. 4 points. Introduces the syntax of Romance languages, primarily French, Italian, and Spanish, but also various Romance dialects. Considers what they have in common with each other (and with English) and how best to characterize the ways in which they differ from each other (and from English). Neural Bases of Language LING-UA 43 Identical to PSYCH-UA 300. Prerequisite: Language (LING-UA 1), Language and Mind (LING-UA 3, formerly 28), PSYCH-UA 25, PSYCH-UA 29, or permission of the instructor. Offered every year. Pylkkanen. 4 points. What are the brain bases of our ability to speak and understand language? Are some parts of the brain dedicated to language? What is it like to lose language? Provides a state-of-the-art survey of the cognitive neuroscience of language, a rapidly developing multidisciplinary field at the intersection of linguistics, psycholinguistics, and neuroscience. Lectures cover all aspects of language processing in the healthy brain, from early sensory perception to sentence-level semantic interpretation, as well as a range of neurological and development language disorders, including aphasias, dyslexia, and genetic language impairment. Field Methods LING-UA 44 Identical to LING-GA 44. Prerequisite: Sound and Language (LING-UA 11) and either Phonological Analysis (LING-UA 12) or Grammatical Analysis (LING-UA 13), or permission of the instructor. Offered every year. Collins, Gallagher, Gouskova, Singler. 4 points. A hands-on approach to learning linguistics. Every year, a different language is chosen to investigate. Students interview a native speaker of an unfamiliar language, usually a nonlinguist, to study all aspects of the language's grammar: phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics. They learn to evaluate and organize real, nonidealized linguistic data and to formulate generalizations that then serve as the basis for a research proposal. A unique opportunity to obtain a rich and complete set of data on a new topic of theoretical interest in any field of linguistics.Evolution of Intellectual Complexity LING-UA 45 Offered occasionally. Dougherty. 4 points. How do human perception, cognition, language, and communication relate to the abilities of animals, fossil records, anthropological and archaeological research, cave painting, and physiology? We broadly try to answer the following: What is a likely scenario for human evolution from animal origins? We argue (with Chomsky, Darwin, D'Arcy, Thompson, T uring, Lorenz, Gould) that evolution proceeds in large jumps (saltations) and that slow, gradual evolution via natural selection (per Pinker, Hauser, Fitch, Lieberman) cannot account for human cogni- tive evolution. Readings focus on original works by Darwin, Wallace, D'Arcy, Thompson, Freud, Chomsky, Galileo, and Pinker and include studies by zoologists, linguists, anthropologists, archaeolo- gists, and psychologists. African American English II: Language and Education LING-UA 46 Identical to SCA-UA 800. Offered occasionally. Blake. 4 points. African American English is a distinct dialect of American English that has influenced U.S. and world cultures, yet its speakers have faced well- documented educational challenges. Explores contemporary, social, linguistic, and educational issues that arise for speakers of African American English in the United States. Topics covered include a history of African American language behavior, politics, and policies around the language, teacher education, language attitudes, culture and cur- riculum, and controversies about African American English in the schools. The Language of America's Ethnic Minorities LING-UA 47 Offered every other year. Blake, Singler. 4 points. Examines the role of language in communities in the United States, specifically within African American, Asian American, Latino, and Native American populations. Explores the relationship of language to culture, race, and ethnicity. In particular, looks for similarities and differences across these communities and considers the role that language experiences play in current models of race and ethnicity.325 LINGUISTICS C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF LINGUISTICS Linguistics as Cognitive Science LING-UA 48 Identical to LING-GA 48. Prerequisite: permission of the instructor. Offered every year. Marantz. 4 points. Foundational questions for a science of linguistics are addressed both from within linguistics and from philosophy and psychology. Issues include the nature of the evidence for constructing grammars, the interpretation of grammatical rules as cognitive or neural operations, the significance of neo-behaviorist approaches to language and computational modeling for a cognitive theory of language, the connection between linguistics theory and genetics, and the importance of sociocultural and historical variation for understanding the nature of language. Students are expected to engage in debate over these issues, bringing to the table their own backgrounds in one of the relevant disciplines, as well as what they learn from the assigned readings. Guest speakers with complementary expertise join the primary instructor for several of the lectures. Endangered Languages LING-UA 50 Offered occasionally. Collins. 4 points. The languages of the world are dying off at an alarming rate. We attempt to answer the following questions during the semester: Why do languages die off? If a language dies, does a culture die with it? How is the structure of a language (phonology, morphology, syntax) affected by language death? Why should we care about language endangerment, and is there anything we can do about it? Each student \"adopts\" an endangered language and looks into it extensively during the course of the semester. A Cultural History of Computers, Robots, and Artificial Intelligence LING-UA 51 Offered every year. Dougherty. 4 points. Considers primary source material on the mind-body problem and on linguistic criteria for intelligence, starting with Galileo and Descartes and continuing up to the present day. Examines mechanical analogies of mind developed since 1500. Readings from Galileo, Descartes, Voltaire, Huxley, Darwin, on Chomsky's Cartesian linguistics and the claim that current ideas concerning mind, lan- guage, and intelligence parallel closely those of the Cartesians of the 17th century.Learning to Speak: The First- and Second-Language Acquisition of Sound LING-UA 54 Prerequisite: Sound and Language (LING-UA 11) or Phonological Analysis (LING-UA 12). Offered occasionally. Adriaans, Davidson. 4 points. Focuses on the acquisition of sound systems by first- and second-language learners. In some ways, these tasks are very similar, but they differ in other crucial aspects. We discuss scientific data from both first- and second-language acquisition of sound systems to understand how humans learn language both in infancy and adulthood. Presupposes an introduction to phonetics, phonology, and/or psycholinguistics. Introduction to Morphology at an Advanced Level LING-UA 55 Identical to LING-GA 1029. Prerequisites: Sound and Language (LING-UA 11) and Phonological Analysis (LING-UA 12). Offered every year. Marantz. 4 points. Examines the building blocks of words and sentences: the atomic units of word structure, their hierarchical and linear arrangement, and their phonological realization(s). Provides an introduction to fundamental issues in morphology, including allomorphy, morpheme order, paradigm structure, blocking, and cyclicity. The field of morphology currently embraces much of what goes on in lin-guistics as a whole; syntax, morphology, phonology, semantics, and variation all play an essential role, and their interactions are highlighted here. Introduction to English Grammar LING-UA 56 Offered occasionally. Collins. 4 points. No prior knowledge of linguistics is assumed. We survey the major areas of English grammar, including the following: parts of speech (verb, noun, adjective, preposition, adverb), participles, auxiliary verbs, count and noncount nouns, definite and indefinite articles, subjects, objects, predicates, types of clauses (declarative, interrogative, exclamative, imperative), passive versus active verbs, negation, and relative clauses. The course is of interest to students of English literature, English grammar, linguistics, computer science, philosophy, and psy- chology. Also useful to people thinking of going into language teaching and those interested in improving their writing through greater attention to English grammar. Note: This is not an English as a Second Language (ESL) course. Students are expected to be native speakers of English or to have a very high level of proficiency in English.326 LINGUISTICS C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF LINGUISTICS Etymology LING-UA 76 Identical to CLASS-UA 23 and MEDI-UA 76.

It is specifically designed for students wishing to work in more than one field of specializa- tion and to develop individualized programs of study around their own interests rather than those of a single departmental major. Individual advisement enables students to develop a coherent course of study that suits their needs and interests. Among the fields of concentration from which students may draw to develop their programs are (1) language and literature: classics, comparative literature, English, French, Hebrew and Judaic, Italian, Middle Eastern (Arabic), and Spanish and Portuguese, (2) art history, (3) history, (4) music, and (5) philosophy and religion. Other more specialized programs of study may be designed in consultation with the director of undergraduate studies. Available to majors and minors is the Marco Polo T ravel Award (granted to an outstanding student each year to allow her or him to travel abroad for research), as well as a field prize for outstanding work in the major. Many majors in the Program in Medieval and Renaissance Studies have gone on to graduate work in medieval studies, early modern studies, Celtic studies, archival and/or museum studies, religious studies, history, art ProgramfacUl TYwww.marc.as.nyu.edu 13 University Place, Room 219, New York, NY 10003-4573 Phone: 212-998-8698 director of the Program Associate Professor Rust Professors emeriti Bonfante (Classics), Carruthers (English), Claster (History), Donoghue (English), Gans (Chemistry), Hyman (Art History), Ivry (Hebrew and Judaic Studies), Javitch (Comparative Literature), P.

It focuses on the history, institutions, languages, literatures, thought, faith, art, and music of Europe, the Atlantic, and the Mediterranean world from the collapse of Roman authority to about 1700 C.E. It is during this important period\u2014which shaped and transmitted the classical heritage\u2014that the social, artistic, intellectual, and scientific culture of present-day Europe and the Middle East was formed. The curriculum in medieval and Renaissance studies links undergraduates with NYU's outstanding humani- ties faculty; with the superb libraries, museums, and collections in the New York area; and with musical and theatrical performances of works from this period that are given regularly in the city. It also enriches students' intellectual and artistic experience in College of Arts and Science programs away. Students design their own programs in consultation with the program director and faculty; they thus receive individualized attention from a center of excellence situated within the rich offerings of a great university and a vibrant city.PROGRAM IN Medieval and Renaissance Studies343 MEDIEv AL AND RENAISSANCE S TUDIES C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYPROGRAM IN MEDIEv AL AND RENAISSANCE S TUDIES history, English, foreign language literatures and cultures, and music.

In addition, students are expected to show proficiency through course work or examination in a classical language (Latin, ancient Greek, Arabic, or Hebrew) and in another foreign language appropriate to their field of concentration. Students who work in later periods and for whom knowledge of two modern foreign languages is advantageous may petition the director of undergraduate studies to substitute the ancient language requirement with a second modern foreign language. minor Five courses (20 points), of which at least two must be in a single field of concentration, one in each of two other fields of concentration, and an interdisciplinary seminar. Program a pproval and a dvisement The director meets with students to discuss their general educational and career aims, as well as the specific opportunities provided by the Program in Medieval and Renaissance Studies. All major and minor programs require the approval of the director of the program. honors Program To qualify for the honors program in medieval and Renaissance studies, students must maintain at least a 3.65 cumulative average and a 3.65 major average. The honors track is a yearlong 8-point program, during the course of which students write and orally defend an honors thesis. The thesis is an extended research paper written on a topic of the student's choice related to his or her course of study and directed by a faculty adviser. During the fall semester of their senior year, students who qualify for honors enroll in the Senior Honors Seminar (MEDI-UA 998), a colloquium for thesis writers; in the spring semester, they enroll in Honors Independent Study (MEDI-UA 999). The Senior Honors Seminar guides students through the research and writing of the thesis, covering such areas as choosing a topic, compiling a bibliography, conducting library and web-based research, properly documenting sources, and developing research and writing methods for graduate-level study. In Honors Independent Study, students complete their thesis projects under the supervision of a faculty mentor. Students interested in pursuing the honors program should consult with the director of the program by the second semester of their junior year. The requirements of the honors program are as follows: completion of all major requirements; successful completion of the honors seminar; completion of an honors thesis; and an oral presentation on the honors thesis and its bibliography. accelerated B. a./m.a. Program Qualifying students may apply to earn an accelerated B.A. in medieval and Renaissance studies and an M.A. in a related department. Interested students must consult with the director of the program. Requirements for the B.A./M.A. program are outlined in the pre-professional, accelerated, and specialized programs section of this Bulletin. Study a way The program prepares and encourages its students to complement their work in medieval and Renaissance stud- ies at one of NYU's academic centers in Florence, London, Madrid, Paris, and Prague, or at one of the Western European exchange universities.

T wo introductory courses\u2014may be taken in any order: Concepts in Social and Cultural Analysis (SCA-UA 1) Approaches to Metropolitan Studies (SCA-UA 601) Seven elective courses: Six designated metropolitan studies electives; Internship Fieldwork/Seminar (SCA-UA 40/SCA-UA 42) are no longer required but highly recommended and together can count as an elective One common elective; a list will be available each semester T wo research courses: Strategies in Social and Cultural Analysis (SCA-UA 20) Senior Research Seminar (SCA-UA 90) A note about language/linguistic competency: The type of rigorous intercultural study promoted within the Department of Social and Cultural Analysis requires students to recognize the complex modes of communica-tion at work both within and across different social groups. The department therefore strongly encourages its students to develop advanced skills in language and linguistics by any of the following means: taking elective courses in sociolinguistics; studying a language other than English beyond the minimum level required by the College of Arts and Science; studying languages especially germane to the department's fields of study; pursuing Metropolitan studies, part of the Department of Social and Cultural Analysis (SCA), is an interdisciplinary major focused on the study of cities and metropolitan regions in historical and contemporary perspective. Students use New York City and other global metropolitan centers as their laboratories for understanding the processes of urban and regional development, the major institutions of urban life, urban social move- ments, urban cultural dynamics, and the socio-environmental consequences of worldwide urbanization. The program draws on the expertise of a wide range of urban scholars within SCA and in complementary departments at NYU. In addition, faculty active in the city's government, community, and nonprofit agencies provide a unique resource for understanding the city. The major provides particularly valuable preparation for students interested in law, health, teaching, journalism, social work, architecture, city and regional planning, public policy, public administration, nonprofit administration, and community organization. An accelerated B.A./M.P .A. and B.A./M.U.P . arrangement exists with NYU's Robert F . Wagner Graduate School of Public Service.

It consists of two components: language study and non-language courses. Language Study To obtain the B.A. degree with a Middle Eastern and Islamic studies (MEIS) major, students must meet the College of Arts and Science (CAS) language requirement in Arabic, Hindi, Persian, T urkish, or Urdu. This means (1) studying one of these languages through at least the intermediate level (four semesters) at NYU, (2) demonstrating the completion of equivalent course work elsewhere, or (3) satisfying the CAS language require- ment by taking the CAS placement exam in one of these languages. Under exceptional circumstances, the director of undergraduate studies may exempt a student from having to fulfill the language requirement, in which case the student will be required to take ten MEIS non-language courses to complete the major. In any event, every student must always complete at least ten MEIS-approved courses to satisfy requirements for the major. Non-Language Course Requirements In addition to the language requirement, majors must successfully complete at least six MEIS courses distributed across distinct fields. The six MEIS courses are to be distributed as follows.Professors emeriti Chelkowski, Mcchesney, Mikhail, Peters Professors Ben-Dor Benite, Pearce, Peirce, Tawil-Souriwww.meis.as.nyu.edu South, New York, NY 10012-1073 Phone: 212-998-8880 chair of the department Professor Ben-Dor Benitedirector of Undergraduate Studies Associate Professor keshavarzianDEPARTMENT OF Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies The Department of Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies (MEIS) focuses on the past and present of a vast and culturally diverse region of the world that extends from North Africa to Central Asia and from the Mediterranean to the Indian Ocean. It adopts interdisciplinary and comparative approaches to Middle Eastern societies from antiquity to the present, with particular focus on the period after the emergence of Islam. A Middle Eastern and Islamic studies major offers students the opportunity to master one of the regional languages, including Arabic, Hindi, Persian, T urkish, Urdu, and ancient Egyptian. Students also acquire an interdisciplinary understanding of this pivotal area of the world by studying with the depart-ment's specialists in history, anthropology, political science, literature, law, religious studies, and language. In addition to the courses listed below, students are encouraged to select cross-listed courses in other departments and programs that complement the department's offerings, such as anthropology, art history, comparative literature, Hebrew and Judaic studies, history, politics, religious studies, and sociology.355 MIDDLE EASTERN AND ISLAMIC S TUDIES C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF MIDDLE EASTERN AND ISLAMIC S TUDIES T wo core courses: To ensure broad knowledge of issues in the discipline, all majors must take two \"core courses\" among their six non-language courses. It is recommended that students take these courses before they take seminars and topics courses. Core courses are as follows: MEIS-UA 690: The Emergence of the Modern Middle East (History) MEIS-UA 697: Palestine, Zionism, and Israel (History) MEIS-UA 711: Literature and Society in the Middle East (Literature) MEIS-UA 728: Women and Gender in Islam (Religion) MEIS-UA 750: Middle East Politics (Elective) The department may choose to designate additional courses as core courses and will announce them accordingly. Core courses must be taken at Washington Square and cannot be taken while studying away at an NYU global academic center. One topics/seminar course: Also, among the six non-language courses, all majors must take at least one advanced undergraduate seminar; MEIS often offers these under the \"topics\" rubric (e.g. MEIS-UA 688: Topics in Middle East History). Also, with the permission of the instructor, this requirement may be fulfilled with a graduate seminar. Distribution fields: All majors must take these six non-language courses (including the core and topics courses) in a manner that is distributed across departmental fields as follows: T wo courses from the MEIS history list One course from the MEIS literature list One course from the MEIS religion list T wo elective courses from the MEIS course list of the student's choice Note that all core courses cannot fit into specific distribution fields. Transfer credits: After consultation with the director of undergraduate studies, transfer students may be allowed to apply up to five transfer courses (20 points) toward the major. Please note that NYU Global courses (e.g. NYU Abu Dhabi) may be considered transfer credits and require departmental approval. minor Students who wish to minor in Middle Eastern and Islamic studies must complete either: four non-language courses (16 points), including one of the core courses listed above; the courses must be offered or cross-listed by MEIS and approved by the director of undergraduate studies or a MEIS adviser; or four courses (16 points) in Arabic, Persian, or T urkish, provided that these courses are not also used to satisfy the CAS foreign language requirement. After consultation with the director of undergraduate studies, transfer students may be allowed to apply up to two transfer courses (8 points) toward the minor. Please note that NYU Global courses (e.g. NYU Abu Dhabi) may be considered transfer credits and require departmental approval. Internships MEIS majors may, with permission of the director of undergraduate studies, pursue an internship for 2 or 4 points (MEIS-UA 980, 981). The application form is available in the MEIS Office. honors Program Eligibility Any student majoring in the department who has spent at least two full years in residence at the College of Arts and Science, who has completed at least 60 points of graded work in the College, and has a cumulative GPA of 3.65 and a major GPA of 3.65.356 MIDDLE EASTERN AND ISLAMIC S TUDIES C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF MIDDLE EASTERN AND ISLAMIC S TUDIES coUrSeS language c ourses Language placement examinations are held before the first week of the fall and spring semesters and on a regular basis during the academic year.

The major is equally ideal for students seeking careers requiring a solid liberal arts background and strong analytical and critical skills, and for students interested in humanistic fields in which sonic culture is a central element. The music major cultivates the ability to interpret and analyze music as both text and performance. As such, the major program of studies and our faculty's specializations offer superb foundations for further advanced studies in music and disciplines such as American studies, compara- tive literature, linguistic and cultural anthropology, Native American studies, popular culture, gender studies, Western and Central European culture and history, Slavic studies, Latin American and Latino studies, media studies, performance studies, and theatre. major The major in music requires a total of ten 4-point courses (40 points), designed to give the student a broad understanding of the various issues currently being discussed in musical thinking and research, as well as a theoretical background and the opportunity to compose for himself or herself. Qualified students can undertake advanced supervised research in their senior year, leading to a thesis and the award of a degree with honors.Professors emeriti Burrows, Chusid, Fennelly, Roesner Boorman, Hoffman, karchin associate Professors Mahon, Daughtry, Oliver La Rosaglobal distinguished Professor Moloney clinical associate Professor Mueller affiliated associates Bravo (NYU Abu Dhabi), k apchan (Performance Studies\u2014Tisch)chair of the department Associate Professor Samuels director of Undergraduate Studies Professor Boormanwww. music.as.nyu.edu Waverly Building 24 Waverly Place, Room 268, New York, NY 10003-6789 Phone: 212-998-8300 Since its establishment in 1923, the Department of Music at New York University has occupied a central position in American music scholarship. It has since grown into one of the country's most exciting, intellectually vibrant centers for the interdisciplinary study of music and sound. Undergraduate students in the department study, create, and perform music in an environment that combines the benefits of a well-rounded liberal arts education with the resources of a major research university. University resources include a large number of rehearsal and practice rooms, and the department has its own intimate, loftlike performance space that serves as a recording studio and as a venue for recitals and concerts. The department hosts the Washington Square Contemporary Music Society, the Collegium Musicum, and the Washington Square Harp and Shamrock Orchestra, the only Irish music ensemble in any university in the United States. The department's greatest asset, however, is its location in the heart of New York City, one of the world's great cultural centers. Many of our courses are structured around live performances at venues ranging from the city's top concert halls to its most obscure performance spaces. We also encourage our students to take advantage of our location by pursuing internships with New York City-based recording companies, music magazines, or major performing arts organizations. DEPARTMENT OF Music363 MUSIC C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF MUSIC The ten courses for the major are as follows: T wo required courses: Either Harmony and Counterpoint I or II (MUSIC-UA 201 or 202), offered every semester. Principles of Musical Analysis: Aural Perception (MUSIC-UA 209), typically offered in the fall. Five distribution requirements across the following areas: \"Sonic materials of music\": one course from offerings on studies of sound, or of a genre; possible courses could be on noise, on voice, or on the operatic aria. \"Creating music\": one course on composition, improvisation, performance practice (with a practical component), or performance of a particular repertoire. \"Music, histories, cultures\": two courses; many courses in musicology and ethnomusicology (the anthropology of music) fit into this category. \"Analytical and critical thinking\": one course in either of those areas; courses might be on musical philosophy, on gender or embodiment, or on an analytical issue. Electives: The remaining three courses are free electives in the department. Students may count up to four credits of performance classes (in the Steinhardt School's Department of Music and Performing Arts Professions or in our department's Collegium Musicum) toward the music major. Only courses with a grade of C or better can be counted toward the major. For instructions on how to declare the major, please visit the department's website. The department welcomes double majors. minor A total of four courses (16 points) is required for the music minor: One course on music theory chosen from among The Elements of Music (MUSIC-UA 20) or Harmony and Counterpoint I,II (MUSIC-UA 201, 202). One course on European music history (MUSIC-UA 101-104 or other appropriate course). One course on ethnomusicology or anthropology of music (MUSIC-UA 151, 153, 155, 182). One additional course numbered at or above the MUSIC-UA 100 level. Four points of performance (from our department or Steinhardt) may be used for this requirement. Only courses with a grade of C or better can be counted toward the minor. For instructions on how to declare the minor, please visit the department's website. honors Program Highly motivated students may take part in the department's honors program, which culminates during the senior year with an independent study supervised by a faculty member. Students must have a 3.65 GPA both in the major and overall to pursue honors. Students wishing to graduate with honors must take the depart-ment's Proseminar in Music (MUSIC-UA 200); they then register for a semester or more of Independent Study (MUSIC-UA 997 or 998) in which they complete a capstone project in musicology or music history, ethno- musicology, analysis, or composition. This might take the form of an analytical or historiographical study of a major work or group of works, the writing of a musical composition of substantial dimensions, or a biographical study of a composer, all under the guidance of a faculty member. A student wishing to pursue departmental honors should apply to the director of undergraduate studies. There are also three departmental prizes that the department awards to exceptional students. These are listed in the awards and prizes section of this Bulletin. Performance Students pursuing a major or minor in music, and indeed all students in the College of Arts and Science, are encouraged to participate in musical performance, lessons, and ensembles. We believe that the joys of making music, the dedication and study necessary to perform music, and the collective effort required of ensemble participants constitute an inimitable experience that should have a central place in a liberal arts education. Students can participate in the Collegium Musicum early music ensemble, the NYU Orchestra, and many of 364 MUSIC C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF MUSIC the lesson programs and ensembles associated with the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development's Department of Music and Performing Arts Professions. Students are also urged to attend concerts of the Washington Square Contemporary Music Society. In addition to participation in the various performance ensembles, the department encourages students to partake vigorously of the cultural life of New York City. Our students are entitled to discounted tickets to the Metropolitan Opera, the New York Philharmonic, concerts of the World Music Institute, concerts of the Kalavant Center for Indian Music and Dance, and many other music-presenting organizations. We work closely with and support the activities of cultural organizations such as the Center for T raditional Music and Dance, Music Before 1800, the Archives of Contemporary Music, and AfroPop Worldwide, among many others. A listing and description of music organizations at New York University is available from the department or the Center for Music Performance.

The four main branches are metaphysics (What is the ultimate nature of reality? What really exists and what is mere appearance?), epistemology (What, if anything, can be known and how?), logic (What are the principles of correct reasoning?), and ethics (What is moral value? And what moral values should we adopt?). Other, more specific branches of philosophy address questions concerning the nature of art, law, medicine, politics, religion, and the sciences. Everyone tends to have or assume answers to these questions. The aim of the department is to enable stu- dents to identify, clarify, and assess these answers, both ancient and modern. Philosophy prepares students for a more reflective life, for advanced studies in the subject, and for professions that emphasize analytic thinking and argumentation, such as law, business, and programming.DEPARTMENT OF Philosophy371 PHILOSOPHY C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF PHILOSOPHY All students should begin with one of the introductory courses. Satisfactory completion of any one course at the introductory level is a prerequisite for all of the other courses required for the major, except Logic. It is recom- mended that those considering a major also take Logic as soon as possible. No credit toward the major is awarded for a course with a grade lower than C. Joint m ajor in l anguage and m ind This major, intended as an introduction to cognitive science, is administered by the Departments of Linguistics, Philosophy, and Psychology.

For advisement, language and mind majors should consult with the directors of undergraduate studies of the participating departments. minor A minor in philosophy requires four 4-point courses (16 points) in the department. These four courses must include one (and only one) introductory course (PHIL-UA 1-5), and one course from each of the department's three groups of courses: Group 1: History of Philosophy Group 2: Ethics, Values, and Society Group 3: Logic, Epistemology, Metaphysics, Mind and Language No credit toward the minor is awarded for a course with a grade lower than C. Independent Study A student may register for an independent study course (PHIL-UA 301, 302; 2 or 4 points per term) if he or she obtains the consent of a faculty member who approves the study project and agrees to serve as adviser. The student must also obtain the approval of either the department chair or the director of undergraduate studies. The student may take no more than one such course in any given semester and no more than two such courses in total, unless granted special permission by either the department chair or the directors of undergraduate studies. honors Program Honors in philosophy will be awarded to majors who (1) have an overall GPA of 3.65 and an average in philoso- phy courses of 3.65 and (2) successfully complete the honors program. This program consists of the following three 4-point courses (12 points). (Note: of these courses, only the first two may be counted toward the ten courses required for the major.) The Junior Honors Proseminar (PHIL-UA 200) should be taken in the spring semester of junior year. It introduces students to core readings in some of the main areas of current philosophy and provides an intensive training in writing philosophy. Admission to this course usually requires a GPA, both overall and in philosophy courses, of at least 3.65, as well as the permission of the director of undergraduate studies. The department will try to make alternative arrangements for students who wish to participate in the honors program but who will be studying abroad in spring of their junior year. Next, the Senior Honors Seminar (PHIL-UA 201) should be taken in the fall semester of senior year. Students begin to develop their thesis projects, meeting weekly as a group under the direction of a faculty member to present and discuss their thesis arguments. Students also select, and begin to meet separately with, their indi-vidual thesis advisers\u2014faculty who work in the areas of students' thesis projects. Entry to this seminar depends on satisfactory completion of the Junior Honors Proseminar\u2014or on the special approval of the directors of undergraduate studies. It also usually requires a GPA of at least 3.65, both overall and in the philosophy major. Finally, Senior Honors Research (PHIL-UA 202) should be taken in the spring semester of senior year. The seminar no longer meets, but each student continues to meet separately with his or her individual thesis adviser, producing and discussing a series of rough drafts of the thesis. The final version must be submitted by a deadline to be determined, in April. It must be approved by the thesis adviser, as well as by a second faculty reader, for honors to be awarded. The student must also finish with a GPA of at least 3.65 both overall and in the major\u2014and here no exceptions will be made. In addition, the thesis advisers will meet after the decisions by the readers have been made and award some students highest or high honors, based on thesis quality and other factors (including GPA in philosophy courses).373 PHILOSOPHY C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF PHILOSOPHY course Prerequisites The department treats its course prerequisites seriously.

They provide good preparation for graduate school; indeed, many of our students go on to some of the world's best graduate programs. They develop a range of technical skills, most of which relate to the challenging intellectual problems of building quantitative theoretical models and making precise measurements of physically interesting phenomena. The programs are also designed to satisfy curiosity about the fundamental laws that govern every aspect of the world, from the interactions of subatomic particles to the origin and behavior of the entire universe. The programs are simultaneously very deep and very broad. Course work includes both theoretical subjects and experimental activity in laboratories. The programs are designed to give students flexibility in years three and four to pursue interdisciplinary activities, spend time abroad, or delve into greater depth in a subject or into original research.ProgramfacUl TYchair of the department Professor Gabadadze director of Undergraduate Studies Associate Professor Hogg Professors emeriti Bederson, Borowitz, Brown, Professors; Professors of Physics Professor Adlerwww.physics.as.nyu.edu Andre and Bella Meyer Hall of Physics 4 Washington Place, New York, NY 10003-6621 Phone: 212-998-7700 Physics is the most basic of the natural sciences. It is concerned with understanding the world on all scales of length, time, and energy. The methods of physics are diverse, but they share a common objective to develop and refine fundamental models that quantitatively explain observations and the results of experi- ments. The discoveries of physics rank among the most important achievements of human inquiry and have had an enormous impact on human culture and civilization. Members of the department conduct research in the fields of astrophysics, biophysics, cosmology, elementary particle physics, gravitation, hard and soft condensed matter physics, and statistical physics, carrying out experimental work in state-of-the art laboratories in the department and at such national and international facilities as the Large Hadron Collider at CERN and large astronomical observatories. The educational programs of the department are aimed at providing a range of courses to meet the needs of different student groups. For undergraduate physics majors, there is a rigorous core program, exposure to current frontiers, and opportunities for research. For science majors outside of physics, there are technical courses that emphasize the fundamental physical laws that underpin other sciences; and for nonscience majors, nontechnical courses introduce some of the most important concepts of physics and their impact on the contemporary world.DEPARTMENT OF Physics379 PHYSICS C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF PHYSICS The department is a collegial place where faculty and students get to know one another well. There are regular formal and informal seminars, as well as a thriving Society of Physics Students, and students and faculty often collaborate on original research problems. Many of the students participate in original research and coauthor scientific publications. For all of these reasons, and in addition to the rigor of the courses, students are extremely well prepared for a wide range of activities\u2014not just in scientific research, but also in professional and engineer- ing pursuits, or any area where abstract thinking and quantitative modeling of real systems are necessary and rewarded. Nonmajors For nonscience majors, there are nontechnical courses that introduce some of the concepts and events that are most important to understanding physics and its impact. For science majors outside of physics, there are technical courses that provide a breadth of ideas about the fundamental laws that underpin the other sciences. The department provides courses designed to meet the preprofessional goals of prehealth students and students in engineering disciplines Minors Students who are interested in obtaining significant exposure to the ideas of physics without committing to the major or without obtaining a comprehensive mathematical background can minor in physics or astronomy. majors Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) Program The major in physics consists of the following eighteen courses (53 to 55 points): Year 1: Calculus I (MATH-UA 121) Calculus II (MATH-UA 122) Physics I (PHYS-UA 91) and Introductory Experimental Physics I (PHYS-UA 71) (5 points together) Physics II (PHYS-UA 93) and Introductory Experimental Physics II (PHYS-UA 72) (5 points together) Year 2: Calculus III (MATH-UA 123) Physics III (PHYS-UA 95) and Intermediate Experimental Physics I (PHYS-UA 73) (5 points together) Classical and Quantum Waves (PHYS-UA 105) and Intermediate Experimental Physics II (PHYS-UA 74) (5 points together) Mathematical Physics (PHYS-UA 106) Years 3 and 4: Advanced Experimental Physics (PHYS-UA 112) Quantum Mechanics I (PHYS-UA 123) Electricity and Magnetism I (PHYS-UA 131) Thermal and Statistical Physics (PHYS-UA 140) T wo advanced physics electives (3 or 4 points each) Mathematics requirement: The calculus requirement is satisfied by taking either the Calculus I, II, III sequence (MATH-UA 121-123) or the sequence Honors Calculus I, II: Accelerated Calculus with Linear Algebra (MATH-UA 221, 222; 5 points per term). Potential physics majors should begin their calculus sequence in the fall semester of their freshman year. Variations may be constructed with the approval of the director of undergraduate studies. In addition, students are advised to take advanced mathematics courses\u2014such as Linear Algebra (MATH-UA 140)\u2014as they proceed in the major. Double major with physics: The major offers flexibility to complete the requirements for a second major in the College. Students may wish to combine a major in physics with a major in a field such as mathematics, computer science, chemistry, economics, or biology. Students should consult the director of undergraduate studies in their freshman year to outline a program that is best tailored to their needs.380 PHYSICS C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF PHYSICS Bachelor of Science (B.S.)

Emphasizes several different styles of laboratory experiments, but field experiments (and, briefly, survey experiments) are also discussed.coUrSeSPrelaw Although law schools do not require any particular major or course of study, political science is an especially use- ful field for students planning legal study and a career in law. For this reason, it is not surprising that, over the years, more law students have majored in this field than in any other. The Association of American Law Schools has suggested that the study of the political organization of societies; democratic processes of Western societies; freedom of individuals; and the art of peaceful, orderly adaptation to change are among the areas of importance in prelegal education. The association also suggests that students develop the power to think both creatively and analytically. We recommend that students interested in a prelaw course of study choose courses in consultation with the College of Arts and Science prelaw adviser in Silver Center, Room 901, 212-998-8160.388 POLITICS C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYWILF F AMILY DEPARTMENT OF POLITICS Undergraduate Field Seminar: Analytical Politics POL-UA 895 Prerequisites: cumulative GPA of 3.0 and four previous courses in politics or permission of the instructor.

Cognitive psychologists focus on perception, memory, attention, language, and thinking. Social psychologists determine how social beliefs, attitudes, and decisions are formed and maintained. Cognitive neuroscientists study features and functions in the brain as they relate to certain mental processes. Developmental psychologists seek to understand factors that affect and influence individuals across various ages. These many perspectives are reflected in undergraduate course offerings, all of which emphasize the scientific basis of psychology. In addition to its course offerings, the department encourages advanced undergraduates to become involved with the research of individual faculty through the Research Experiences and Methods course and the honors program. Highly qualified students are admitted to the honors program in their sophomore or junior year, take honors seminars, participate in primary research, and write an honors research thesis under close faculty supervision. NYU psychology majors graduate with an excellent academic foundation in psychology and are well prepared for graduate study in the field. Graduates are accepted by top programs throughout the country. Others go on to careers in law, business, medicine, and education.DEPARTMENT OF Psychology398 PSYCHOLOGY C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF PSYCHOLOGY major in Psychology Ten 4-point courses (40 points) are required: Introduction to Psychology (PSYCH-UA 1) Statistics for the Behavioral Sciences (PSYCH-UA 10) Data Analysis and Experimental Design (PSYCH-UA 11) T wo courses from Core A (psychology as a natural science) T wo courses from Core B (psychology as a social science) One laboratory course from Core C T wo advanced electives Note: Developmental Psychology (PSYCH-UA 34) can be selected by a student to count as either a Core A or Core B requirement (but not both). To declare a major in psychology, a grade of C or better must be earned in both Introduction to Psychology (PSYCH-UA 1) and Statistics for the Behavioral Sciences (PSYCH-UA 10). Credit toward the major is not given for courses completed with a grade of less than C. general recommendations The curriculum offers a variety of possible sequences of courses that proceed from introductory to advanced levels. It is best that Introduction to Psychology be taken first, preferably in the freshman year. Statistics for the Behavioral Sciences should be taken next, as it lays the methodological groundwork for the research to be discussed in the core courses. Statistics must be among the first four psychology courses taken, and Data Analysis and Experimental Design should be taken early on as well. Core A and B courses of greatest interest to the student should be taken as soon as possible as preparation for the relevant Core C laboratory course and advanced electives that follow. For instance, if a student expects to do graduate work in the area of perception, then the Core A course Perception should be taken in the sophomore year, so that Laboratory in Perception and Advanced Seminar in Perception can be taken later. In general, it is advisable that students complete their Core C laboratory course requirement before taking advanced courses, preferably by the spring of the junior year. Students interested in graduate training in psychology should become involved in research. Research Methods and Experience (PSYCH-UA 999) offers students the opportunity to participate in faculty research, providing students with a supervised research experience, as well as training in research presentation and criticism. This course is of great assistance to students in deciding about career directions and, because of the direct contact with faculty involved, can result in a letter of recommendation that graduate schools are likely to take very seriously. Pursuing an Interest in Clinical Psychology Students who are particularly interested in graduate work in clinical psychology are encouraged to include Personality (PSYCH-UA 30), Laboratory in Clinical Research (PSYCH-UA 43) or Laboratory in Psychopathology (PSYCH-UA 48), and Abnormal Psychology (PSYCH-UA 51, formerly PSYCH-UA 35) among their course selections. Developmental Psychology (PSYCH-UA 34) is also an appropriate choice. The department provides special advisement for students interested in graduate work in clinical areas of psychology and related fields. Contact the undergraduate program office for details. Pursuing an Interest in Experimental Psychology or Industrial and Organizational Psychology If a student plans to pursue a research career (particularly in Core A areas), in addition to the relevant courses in the major, courses in mathematics, chemistry, biology, physics, and computer science may be most useful.

This program prepares students for graduate-level work in psychology or related professional fields such as business, law, or medicine and provides them with experiences and skills that may be helpful in reaching their career objectives. Students must apply for admission to the honors program in their sophomore or junior year, with occasional exceptions for late transfer students. Admission is based on grades (a minimum overall and major GPA of 3.65) and the ability to benefit from a program that emphasizes independent research projects and seminars that focus on current research topics and issues. Honors students take the Honors Seminar sequence in either their junior or senior year: Honors Seminar I (PSYCH-UA 200) in the fall and Honors Seminar II (PSYCH-UA 201) in the spring. An honors research the- sis, usually based on an expansion of a research project ongoing in a faculty laboratory and serving as evidence of individual thought and creativity, is submitted for faculty approval near the end of the junior or senior year.

First, students study the theories and methods through which religion is analyzed today, including psychologi- cal, sociological, anthropological, philosophical, historical, legal, and literary approaches. They also approach the study of \"religion\" as a concept, which has itself been an intellectual object of inquiry and has played a key role in the development of the social and human sciences. Second, students learn empirically about religion in different times and places, either through historical or ethnographic study, using textual, visual, and audio sources. Third, students use religions, approached as lived practices, as a lens for examining other realms in social life, such as gender and sexuality, race, the nation-state, violence, memory, ethics, emotions, politics, economy, power, art, literature, and media. These realms, in turn, have an impact on religions. The Program in Religious Studies is closely affiliated with the Center for Religion and Media. It should be stressed that the program is oriented toward the academic analysis of religious phenomena and does not promote or endorse either religious belief itself or the views and practices of any particular religious tradition.406 RELIGIOUS S TUDIES C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYPROGRAM IN RELIGIOUS S TUDIES Theories and Methods in the Study of Religion RELST-UA 1 Offered in the fall. 4 points.

In the High Middle Ages and the Renaissance, they developed and evolved into languages that we recognize as the basis of (among others) modern Italian, French, Spanish, and Portuguese. The great works of literature produced in these centuries became the foundation of the national literatures of their respective cultures. The major in Romance languages in the College of Arts and Science is a nine-course major administered by the Departments of Italian, French, and Spanish and Portuguese. Students choose a combination of any two of these four languages, taking five courses in one and four in the other. Thus, majors in Romance languages are able to take advantage of the rich course offerings and resources of our world-renowned language departments and to learn from distinguished scholars in two fields. The major stresses competence in speaking and writing before moving into literary and cultural course- work. To improve students' facility with their two languages and promote cross-cultural understanding and exposure, study away at NYU Buenos Aires, Florence, Madrid, and Paris is encouraged. While they are at the Washington Square campus, students can take advantage of talks, exhibitions, films, and other events sponsored by the Departments of French, Italian, and Spanish and Portuguese and NYU's Maison Fran\u00e7aise, Casa Italiana, and King Juan Carlos I of Spain Center, as well as by cultural institutions in the City. A major in Romance languages is applicable to careers in international law and business, communications, education, fine arts, tourism, and diplomacy, and also complements majors in such fields as art history, cin- ema studies, comparative literature, history, international relations, linguistics, medieval and Renaissance studies, and music.MAJOR IN Romance Languages www.french.as.nyu.edu www.italian.as.nyu.edu www.spanish.as.nyu.edu 13-19 University Place, New York, NY 10003-4573 (French; Spanish and Portuguese) 24 West 12th Street, New York, NY 10011-8604 (Italian)411 ROMANCE LANGUAGES C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYMAJOR IN ROMANCE LANGUAGES Students must earn a C or better in all courses for the major.

All minors take the core course, Introduction to Science and Society (HIST-UA 94), and then choose three other courses from an approved list posted on the minor website (nyu.edu/science_and_society). Many courses in the minor fall into one of the following four clusters: technology, physics, biology/prehealth, and environmental sciences. Students are strongly encouraged, however, to be creative and challenge themselves to think in ways other than those that are strictly categorical. For example, a student interested in understanding the difference between the natural and the artificial might take the following three elective courses in addition to the required Introduction to Science and Society course: Philosophy of Biology; Humans, Machines, and Aesthetics; and Nature and Technology in Modern America. Students are also strongly encouraged to take courses in the various schools throughout NYU contributing to the minor. This will expose them to a plethora of diverse pedagogical experiences and greatly enhance co-learn- ing. All CAS students may apply 16 points taken in the other schools of NYU toward their degree. Students seeking to raise this limit so as to accommodate the course work of the minor in science and society must file a petition in the Office of the Associate Dean for Students, Silver Center, Room 909; 212-998-8140. core c ourse Introduction to Science and Society HIST-UA 94 Jackson. 4 points.

The minor analyzes how the techniques and methodologies of the humanities and social sciences can be used to illuminate both the context and content of science, technology, and medicine. Drawing upon history, philosophy, anthropology, and sociology, students investigate how culture and society frame\u2014and, indeed, are themselves framed by\u2014science, technology, and medicine. The current influence of scientific, technological, and medical issues on our lives is unprecedented, altering our notions of race, health, responsibility, ownership, ethics, esthetics, and indeed self. We are therefore obliged to understand these critical interactions with a view to understand, and intervene in, the world. The types of questions this minor poses include: How has gene patenting affected both the content and conduct of molecular biology, as well as intellectual property law? What is the relationship between the mathemati-cal descriptions that physicists employ and the nature of physical phenomena? What are the ethical and political issues involved in human embryonic stem cell research? How do machines shape esthetics? What, if anything, is the difference between a machine and a human? How does nature have a history? This minor serves as an enlightening complement to pre-health studies, pre-law studies relevant to intellec- tual property, biotechnology, and environmental and healthcare studies. It also provides a potent training to those interested in pursuing advanced degrees in the history, philosophy, sociology, or anthropology of science, technology, or medicine.director Professor Jackson, Gallatin/ Faculty of Arts and Science Steering c ommittee Associate Professor Appuhn, Faculty of Arts and Science Professor Jackson, Gallatin/ Faculty of Arts and Science Assistant Professor Mills, SteinhardtMINOR IN Science and Society coUrSeS420 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYMINOR IN SCIENCE AND SOCIETY elective c ourses college of arTS aNd ScIeNce anthropology Medical Anthropology ANTH-UA 35 4 points. computer Science Computers in Society CSCI-UA 1 4 points.

This major enables a small number of very capable and highly motivated students to pursue a plan of study that brings together courses from more than one CAS department or program. During their sophomore year, students compose their academic plan for the major in consultation with their two faculty advisers for their self-designed program of study as well as with the associate director of interschool programs and the director of college honors, who serves as the director of undergraduate studies. By spring of the sophomore year, the plan of study must be submitted to and approved by the College's honors committee. The self-designed honors major differs from the individualized major that the Gallatin School offers in several ways: These two NYU schools have distinct admissions criteria, general education curricula, and other requirements. This CAS major serves students who can realize their interdisciplinary goals within CAS (except for the 16 credits of non-CAS courses that CAS already permits), whereas Gallatin students draw heavily on courses from several NYU schools. This CAS major is an honors major, which has prerequisites for entry (e.g., 3.75 GPA; students must maintain a 3.65 GPA to remain in the major) and entails a heavy commitment to honors-level work, including independent research under faculty supervision. Freshmen and sophomores in CAS who are considering the self-designed honors major should contact the College Advising Center (Silver Center, Room 905, 212-998-8130) to schedule an initial advising appoint- ment with the associate director of interschool programs.423 SOCIAL AND CULTURAL ANALYSIS C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYmajor The major in social and cultural analysis comprises introductory, elective, and research components, which together make up a total of eleven 4-point courses (44 points), as outlined below. Students create a concentra- tion, in consultation with their adviser, from the six program areas within SCA: Africana studies, American studies, Asian/Pacific/American studies, gender and sexuality studies, Latino studies, and Metropolitan studies. T wo introductory courses\u2014may be taken in any order: Concepts in Social and Cultural Analysis (SCA-UA 1) One of the following introductory courses: Approaches to Africana Studies (SCA-UA 101) or Cultures and Contexts: Africa (CORE-UA 505) or Cultures and Contexts: The African Diaspora (CORE-UA 532) or Cultures and Contexts: The Black Atlantic (CORE-UA 534) Approaches to American Studies (SCA-UA 201) Approaches to the Asian/Pacific/American Experience (SCA-UA 301) or Cultures and Contexts: Asian/Pacific/American Cultures (CORE-UA 539) to Gender and Sexuality (SCA-UA 401)ProgramfacUl TYProfessor emerita Stacey erich maria r emarque Professor of literature Harper University Professor WillisSilver Professor; Professor of Spanish and Portuguese Pratt Professors Dash, D\u00e1vila, Dinshaw, Duggan, Flores, Molotch, Zaloom assistant Professors Ralph, Saranilliowww.sca.as.nyu.edu 20 Cooper Square, 4th Floor, New York, NY 10003-7112 Phone: 212-992-9650 chair of the department Professor Dinshawdirector of Undergraduate Studies Associate Professor Salda\u00f1aDEPARTMENT OF Social and Cultural Analysis The Department of Social and Cultural Analysis (SCA) is transdisciplinary, combining topics and methodologies from the humanities and social sciences. Its faculty and students work in a broad range of fields, analyzing the social and cultural relationships between individuals, groups, institutions, and govern- ments. In the department, a commitment to historical inquiry coexists with applied knowledge about such modern developments as intensified urbanization, transnational trade and exchange, migration of peoples, racial formation, and the nexus of gender and sexuality. SCA houses and integrates the activities of six interdisciplinary programs\u2014Africana studies, American studies, Asian/Pacific/American studies, gender and sexuality studies, Latino studies, and metropolitan studies\u2014along with the range of degrees and concentrations offered in these programs. In their teaching and research, SCA students and faculty are encouraged to make intersectional links between the areas of interest on which the programs focus. New York City is a crucible for the department's work, both in its community orientation and its connections to global networks. Study in SCA thus provides excellent background for careers in such fields as community organizing, legal advocacy, nonprofit administration, public policy, and urban and regional planning, among many others. SCA students can elect to major or minor in social and cultural analysis, or to major or minor in one of the six interdisciplinary programs listed above. For detailed information, see the entries for these individual programs in this Bulletin.424 SOCIAL AND CULTURAL ANALYSIS C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL AND CULTURAL ANALYSIS Approaches to Latino Studies (SCA-UA 501) or Cultures and Contexts: Contemporary Latino Cultures (CORE-UA 529) Approaches to Metropolitan Studies (SCA-UA 601) Seven elective courses: Six electives from the designated social and cultural analysis course list (must be taught by SCA faculty); Internship Fieldwork/Seminar (SCA-UA 40/SCA-UA 42) are no longer required but highly recom- mended and together can count as an elective One common SCA elective; a list will be available each semester T wo research courses: Strategies in Social and Cultural Analysis (SCA-UA 20) Senior Research Seminar (SCA-UA 90) A note about language/linguistic competency: The type of rigorous intercultural study promoted within the Department of Social and Cultural Analysis requires students to recognize the complex modes of communica- tion at work both within and across different social groups. The department therefore strongly encourages its students to develop advanced skills in language and linguistics by any of the following means: taking elective courses in sociolinguistics; studying a language other than English beyond the minimum level required by the College of Arts and Science (especially one germane to the department's fields of study); pursuing community- based internship fieldwork necessitating the development and use of specific language skills; or undertaking study or research abroad in contexts entailing the exercise of key language or linguistic capabilities. minor The minor in social and cultural analysis requires five courses (20 points): the introductory course Concepts in Social and Cultural Analysis (SCA-UA 1), plus four additional courses selected from the designated SCA course list (must be taught by SCA faculty). honors Program Majors who have completed 48 points of graded work in CAS and have a 3.65 GPA or higher (both overall and in the major) are encouraged to register for Senior Honors Seminar (SCA-UA 92) in the fall semester of their senior year. Upon successful completion of the seminar requirements, students will be eligible to register for Senior Honors Thesis (SCA-UA 93) in the spring. Information about the honors program can be found at sca.as.nyu.edu/object/sca.related.honors. Introductory core Concepts in Social and Cultural Analysis SCA-UA 1 4 points. A gateway to all majors offered by the Department of Social and Cultural Analysis.

Students intern at agencies dealing with a range of issues pertaining to their major and take a coreq-uisite seminar that enables them to focus the work experience in meaningful academic terms. The goals of the internship are threefold: (1) to allow students to apply the theory they have gained through course work, (2) to provide students with analytic tools, and (3) to assist students in exploring professional career paths. The internship is open to juniors and seniors and requires an application, an interview, and permission of the director of internships.

Students majoring in sociology must fulfill the following requirements: One introductory course chosen from the following: Introduction to Sociology (SOC-UA 1) Introduction to Sociology: Honors (SOC-UA 2) Great Books in Sociology (SOC-UA 3) Research Methods (SOC-UA 301) Statistics for Social Research (SOC-UA 302) Sociological Theory (SOC-UA 111) T wo advanced seminars chosen from: SOC-UA 934, 936, 937, 938. When offered, Research Practicum in Qualitative Methods (SOC-UA 801) may substitute for one of the seminars. Three SOC-UA electives Students must earn grades of C or better in their major courses. Of the nine courses required for the major, transfer students must take at least five (20 points) here in the College of Arts and Science. C. Wright Mills once defined sociology as the intersection of history and biography. That is, sociology studies the ways that social structures and interactions shape human experience. Sociologists seek to under- stand the full range of social institutions and practices, from the dynamics of couples and small groups to the shape of institutions such as the church, occupations, and the family to the functioning of communi- ties, cities, and whole societies. Sociological methods of research are diverse, ranging from the quantitative analysis of large surveys to qualitative approaches, such as in-depth interviewing, participant observation, and historical investigation. The Department of Sociology at NYU reflects the diversity of the discipline. The faculty includes experts in deviance, law, and crime; organizations, occupations, and work; politics, social protest, and social policy; education, inequality, and social mobility; culture, art, and mass media; urban community and the global city; and sex, gender, and the family. The department encourages students to study issues from a variety of perspectives and to develop a \"sociological imagination\" that enables them to analyze social arrange- ments and problems. Whether the goal is to become an informed citizen or an expert in a special field, the department offers the tools and knowledge to help students make sense of the world around them.DEPARTMENT OF Sociology429 SOCIOLOGY C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF SOCIOLOGY major in g lobal Public h ealth/Sociology Please see the section on global public health in this Bulletin. minor The Sociology minor consists of four 4-point courses (16 points): one introductory course (as above), plus three other courses in sociology.

Of the four courses required for the minor, transfer students must take at least two (8 points) here in the College of Arts and Science. honors Program Students with at least a 3.65 GPA both overall and in the major (or who have permission of the director of undergraduate studies) may elect to participate in our honors program. In the fall of their senior year, all honors students register for the first term of the Senior Honors Research Seminar (SOC-UA 950), in which they develop and structure their research projects. The faculty member teach- ing the course assists the students in finding substantive and methodological advisers among the faculty. Students complete their thesis in the spring semester of senior year. They register for the second term of the Senior Honors Research Seminar (SOC-UA 951) and work under the supervision of their selected adviser. One semester of the Honors Research Seminar sequence may substitute for one of the two advanced seminars required for the major. Honors students are also encouraged to take graduate courses when appropriate. These courses should stimulate and deepen understanding of sociology and enhance the quality of the final thesis. This should be done in consultation with their advisers.

These minors, which are open to all students in the College of Arts and Science, are either partly or wholly composed of courses from par- ticipating schools, such as the NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering; the Silver School of Social Work; the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development; the Stern School of Business; the Tisch School of the Arts; and the Wagner School of Public Service. Students interested in pursuing a cross-school minor are encouraged to view minor requirements and to contact a minor representative with any questions. Minor curricula and contact information can be found on the NYU cross-school minors website (www.nyu.edu/cross-school-minors). For additional advising support, CAS students can contact the associate director for interschool programs in the College, or schedule an appointment with the associate director through the College Advising Center (Silver Center, Room 905, 212-998-8130). With the exception of the cinema studies minor, all courses taken outside the College to complete cross- school minor requirements count toward the 16-point limit on course work in other divisions. Since many of these minors require 16 points of course work outside the College, students are strongly encouraged to develop their course of study in consultation with a CAS adviser. Courses taken within the College (with a \"UA\" suffix) to complete cross-school minor requirements will not count toward the 16-point limit. Students seeking additional non-CAS credits above the 16-point limit must file a petition in the Office of the Associate Dean for Students, Silver Center, Room 909; 212-998-8140. The minors offered by other NYU schools that are available to CAS students are listed on the NYU cross- school minors website (nyu.edu/cross-school-minors).

The prehealth program of study minimally requires completion of the fol-lowing courses: Principles of Biology I and II (BIOL-UA 11, BIOL-UA 12); Principles of Biology Laboratory (BIOL-UA 123), for students not majoring in biology; General Chemistry I and Laboratory (CHEM-UA 125); General Chemistry II and Laboratory (CHEM-UA 126); Organic Chemistry I and Laboratory (CHEM-UA 225); Organic Chemistry II and Laboratory (CHEM-UA 226); General Physics I and II (PHYS-UA 11, 12); Writing the Essay (EXPOS-UA 100), plus one elective in English or expository writing; Calculus I (MATH-UA 121) or its equivalent; and Biochemistry I (CHEM-UA 881). Preparation for specific entrance exams may warrant the completion of additional coursework in the social sciences, specifically in the areas of psychology and sociology. Some professional schools may recommend or require additional courses, such as statistics, genetics, or microbiology. While prehealth students should strive to earn the best grades possible, they must also keep in mind that schools of the health professions evaluate every aspect of a candidate's background when making admission decisions. Therefore, students are encouraged to pursue a major of heartfelt interest, to participate in extracurricular activities of their choosing, and to develop intellectual pursuits and hobbies outside their schoolwork. Additionally, all prehealth students are very strongly encouraged to obtain work experience, whether as a paid employee or volunteer, in the area they would like to pursue. This practical experience allows students to make an intelligent and informed decision about whether or not they should pursue a career in the health professions. Admissions committees will see that the applicant is dedicated enough to learn about a particular profession, and has been exposed to both its benefits and its challenges. The College's Preprofessional Advising Center (Silver Center, 100 Washington Square East, Room 901; 212-998-8160) has developed an extensive evaluation process that culminates in a letter gener- ated by the Committee on Evaluations to Schools of the Health Professions. Students preparing to apply to schools of the health professions participate in the committee interview process during the spring semester of their application year. Students are encouraged to keep in touch with preprofessional advising throughout their time at NYU so that they are aware of deadlines for the Committee process. Students considering a career in the health professions are strongly urged to discuss their intentions with an academic adviser as early as possible. There is no \"premed\" major at the College, and the designation will not appear on a student's transcript. Students complete the relevant prehealth courses in tandem with their major, College Core Curriculum, and minor (if any) requirements, and it is this parallel structure that allows students to start or stop their prehealth coursework without impacting the completion of their degree. While the Preprofessional Advising Center is located in the College of Arts and Science, preprofessional advisors frequently work with students from other NYU undergraduate divisions who wish to follow the prehealth curriculum. Very detailed information about the undergraduate experience as a prehealth student, about prerequisites for health professional schools, and about the committee interview and application process is available on the Preprofessional Advising Center website, http://prehealth.cas.nyu.edu. B.a./d.d.S. Program The B.A./D.D.S. program is a seven-year joint program between the College of Arts and Science and the College of Dentistry at New York University. It is designed for stu- dents who are certain that they would like to pursue a career in dentistry. Admission requirements include a minimum high school GPA of 3.5 and combined SAT scores of at least 1370. Students with a wide variety of intellectual pursuits and interests are encouraged to apply. Students are admitted to the program as incoming freshmen and engage in academic studies and cocurricular activities that will prepare them for the dental school curriculum. They spend the first three years of the program at the College of Arts and Science, where they complete the College Core Curriculum, the prehealth require-ments, and an abbreviated biology major, for a total of 104 points. Students must maintain a minimum overall GPA of 3.2, as well as a major GPA of at least 3.4; in addi- tion, grades of B or higher must be earned in all courses required for the abbreviated biology major. Students are also expected accelera Ted/JoINT Program IN Preheal Th 449 PREPROFESSIONAL, A CCELERATED , AND SPECIALIZED PROGRAMS C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYto participate in the program's cocurricular activities, which are designed to enhance their understanding of the dental profes- sion; these activities include special lectures, field trips, and cultural functions. During the fall of the third year, students in the B.A./D.D.S. program take the Dental Admission Test and make formal applica-tion to the College of Dentistry. Students enter the College of Dentistry in fall of the fourth year and must maintain matricula-tion in the College of Arts and Science during their first year of dental school. For the B.A. degree to be awarded, an official copy of the first-year dental school transcript and a statement from the College of Dentistry indicating promotion to the second year of dental studies is forwarded to the associate dean for advising and student services in the College of Arts and Science's Office of the Dean. BarBara aNd evaN cheSler Prela W Program The College endorses the position of the Association of American Law Schools that a single \"best\" preparation for law school cannot be recommended. As such, there is no prescribed prelaw curriculum, so prelaw students are free to choose from the wide variety of courses offered at the College of Arts and Science. Purpose of Prelaw Study While the College does not require prelaw students to follow a specific academic cur- riculum, it does advise enrolling in courses that require extensive reading, research, and writing. The College Core Curriculum is excellent preparation for prelaw students, as it offers a rigorous and multidisciplinary foundation for advanced study in the humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences. The honors programs offered by several departments provide opportunities to complete substantial writing projects during the junior and senior years. No matter which major a student chooses, law schools value a well-rounded liberal arts education, so students should select their electives wisely. For example, the precision of methodology and thought required of students in mathematics, computer science, logic, and the natural sciences will aid in the development of analytic skills, while a background in the behavioral sciences and the humanities (politics, economics, history, literature, philosophy, anthropol- ogy, and sociology) will offer a deeper understanding of human institutions and values, as well as opportunities for critical thinking and writing. advising The staff of the College's Preprofessional Advising Center (Silver Center, 100 Washington Square East, Room 901; 212-998-8160) can consult with students on general course selection, law school applications, and related issues. The office serves as a clearinghouse for dean's certifica- tion forms, required by a number of law schools as part of their admissions process. The Lawyer Alumni Mentoring Program (LAMP) offers CAS students an opportu-nity to apply for one-on-one mentoring with experienced attorneys who are alumni of the College. Students should visit http://prelaw.cas.nyu.edu for more information. other Prelaw- related a ctivities The New York University School of Law, conveniently located across the Square from the College, sponsors many events open to the University community. The school's proximity allows prelaw students to observe first-year law school classes and to meet and speak informally with students actively pursuing legal studies. The College and the Undergraduate Law Society also sponsor talks by guest speakers on law-related topics and field trips to courts and schools of law, and arrange for representatives from various law schools to visit the College for information sessions. In addition, the Wasserman Center administers sample Law School Admission Tests (LSAT) in the fall and spring of each year. accelera Ted aNd JoINT ProgramS leadINg T o gradU aTe or SPecIalIZed degreeS Joint B.S./B.S.

The program is ideal for the student interested in science and engineering who is also eager for a liberal arts experience before entering an undergraduate engineering environment. Upon completion of this five-year program, students receive both a B.S. degree from the College of Arts and Science and a B.S. degree from the NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering. Students are admitted to the program as incoming freshmen. See the section on engineering in this Bulletin for details. For more information, students may consult the academic adviser for the dual B.S./B.S. program in the College Advising Center (Silver Center, 100 Washington Square East, Room 905; 212-998-8130).accelerated Bachelor's/ master's Program ( caS and g SaS) The College of Arts and Science (CAS) and the Graduate School of Arts and Science (GSAS) offer students in many departments the opportunity to earn both the bachelor's and master's degrees in a shorter period of time and at less cost than is normally the case. Students may even be eligible to complete a master's degree in a department different than that of their undergraduate major. Qualifying students are typically accepted towards the end of the sophomore year or during the junior year.450 PREPROFESSIONAL, A CCELERATED , AND SPECIALIZED PROGRAMS C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYStudents in the program must satisfy all requirements of both the bachelor's and master's degrees; there is no double-count- ing of courses. In order to complete the program in five years, students are expected to complete at least a quarter of the gradu- ate courses required for the master's degree before earning the bachelor's. This would mean two graduate courses for a master's program consisting of eight courses, or three graduate courses for a program consisting of nine or more courses. If more credits, a significant thesis, or a capstone project is required for the master's, students can accelerate more rapidly by taking additional graduate courses before they complete the bachelor's degree. Students in CAS and Global Liberal Studies (GLS) may apply to the program once they have completed a minimum of three semesters toward the bachelor's degree (at least one semester in CAS is also required for transfer and transition students), and prior to their final two undergraduate semesters. To be eligible, students must have a minimum of two full semesters remaining in CAS or GLS during which they are still working towards completion of undergraduate requirements. Participating departments set minimum GPA require- ments for admission to and continuation in the program; neither may be below 3.5. Students admitted into the bachelor's/ master's program are eligible for a tuition scholarship covering 50% of the credits required for the master's portion of the program. The scholarship is provided upon completion of the bachelor's degree. It is calculated on the basis of (a) the remaining credits needed for the master's degree and (b) additional payments the student may have made in order to accelerate study while matriculated for the bachelor's degree (tuition for more than 18 points during a fall/spring semester due to graduate course enrollment, or for summer graduate courses). The tuition scholarship will remain available for twelve months from the start of the student's first term in GSAS. Beyond the 50% tuition scholarship, students may be eligible for additional forms of financial aid once they matriculate into GSAS. Application guidelines are available online at http://cas.nyu.edu/page/bachelorsmasters. For advising on this program, CAS or GLS students can contact the associate director for interschool programs in the College, or schedule an appointment with the associate director through the College Advising Center (Silver Center, Room 905, 212-998-8130). accelerated Bachelor's/ master's Teacher e ducation Programs (caS and Steinhardt) The College of Arts and Science (CAS) and the Steinhardt Department of Teaching and Learning offer several dual degree programs that allow CAS students in selected majors to complete both their B.A. and an M.A. in teacher education from the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development. Students admitted to one of the B.A./M.A. teacher education programs can, with careful planning, earn both degrees in a shortened time and at less cost than is normally the case. These dual degree programs combine the benefits of a broad liberal arts education at the undergraduate level with a profes- sional education at the graduate level. All programs qualify graduates for initial certi-fication as a teacher in grades 7 through 12 in most states around the country. At this time, CAS and Steinhardt offer the following dual degree teacher education programs: B.A. in biology/M.A. in clinically rich integrated science program (CRISP), grades 7-12 B.A. in chemistry/M.A. in clinically rich integrated science program (CRISP), grades 7-12 B.A. in English/M.A. in teaching English, grades 7-12 B.A. in history/M.A. in teaching history, grades 7-12 B.A. in mathematics/M.A. in teach-ing mathematics, grades 7-12 B.A. in physics/M.A. in clinically rich integrated science program (CRISP), grades 7-12 Students admitted to the bachelor's/master's teacher education track will, depending upon their CAS major, complete graduate credits in teacher education as regular electives during their junior or senior years. Students may view required courses for their particular track by visiting Steinhardt's accelerated B.A./M.A. teacher education program website and may receive additional guidance from Steinhardt's graduate student advisors (Roberto Martinez, roberto. martinez@nyu.edu, for biology, chemistry, mathematics, and physics; Khanh Le, khanh.le@nyu.edu, for English and social studies). Designated track courses may count toward both the B.A. and M.A. degrees. After graduation and pending admission to Steinhardt, students who have completed the teacher education track as undergraduates can finish the remaining credits required for the M.A. degree in one additional year of study. The application process for matriculated CAS students consists of two parts. Students first apply to the teacher educa- tion track in their major. To be eligible for consideration and admission to the track, a student must have an approved major (see above) and a cumulative GPA of at least 3.0. Students may apply to the track once they have completed a minimum of three semesters toward the bachelor's degree (at least one semester in CAS is also required for transfer and transition students), and prior to their final two under- graduate semesters. For formal admission to Steinhardt, CAS seniors must also submit the Steinhardt graduate application prior to graduating from CAS. Admission to the teacher education track does not guarantee admission to Steinhardt. Application guidelines are available online at http://cas.nyu.edu/page/bachelorsmasters. For initial advising, CAS students can contact the associate director for interschool programs in the College, or schedule an appointment with the associate director through the College Advising Center (Silver Center, Room 905, 212-998-8130). accelerated B. a./m.P.a. and B.a./m.U.P. Programs ( caS and Wagner) New York University offers students the opportunity to simultaneously pursue a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) from the College of Arts and Science and a Master of Public Administration (M.P .A.) or Master of Urban Planning (M.U.P .) from the Robert F . Wagner Graduate School of Public Service. Students admitted to the B.A./M.P .A. or B.A./M.U.P . program can, with careful planning, earn both degrees in a shortened time and at less cost than is normally the case. This program combines the benefits of a broad liberal arts education at the undergraduate level with a profes- sional education at the graduate level. CAS undergraduates in any major may apply to the B.A./M.P .A. track. Students choose between two pro- grams in Wagner\u2014either public and nonprofit policy and management, or health policy and management\u2014 and then further specialize within either program. CAS undergraduates in any one of six approved majors are eligible to apply to the B.A./M.U.P . track; the majors are economics, international relations, metropolitan studies, politics, sociology, and urban design and architecture. Students select an area of specialization within the urban planning program. Admission to the B.A./M.P .A. or B.A./M.U.P . track is open to CAS students who have completed at least three semesters in the College with a cumulative GPA of 3.0 or higher (at least one semester in CAS is required for transfer and transition students). For formal admission to Wagner, CAS seniors must also submit the Wagner graduate application prior to graduating from CAS; admission to the B.A./M.P .A. or B.A./M.U.P . track does not guarantee admission to Wagner. Application guidelines are available online at http://cas.nyu.edu/ page/bachelorsmasters. For initial advising, CAS students can contact the associate director for interschool programs in the College, or schedule an appointment with the associate director through the College Advising Center (Silver Center, Room 905, 212-998-8130).To gain maximal benefit from the combined degree program, participating students should aim to complete, while still under- graduates, 28 of the 60 points required for the M.P .A. or M.U.P . This advanced stand- ing can be earned by enrolling in approved courses at Wagner or by taking equivalent courses in CAS, a list of which may be obtained at the website above. Designated track courses may count towards both the undergraduate and graduate degrees. Courses are selected in consultation with the associate director for interschool programs or with the director of student services in Wagner. Metropolitan studies majors follow a course of study that allows them to take full advantage of the combined degree program. Interested students should speak with the director of undergraduate studies in metropolitan studies. 451 PREPROFESSIONAL, A CCELERATED , AND SPECIALIZED PROGRAMS C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYINTerNShIPS One defining characteristic of the New York University educational experience is the opportunity students have to apply their classroom learning to real-life experiences in a variety of professional and community-service settings. New York City provides such opportunities in abundance, and the College of Arts and Science and the University take full advantage of our location in the financial, cultural, scientific, and media capital of the world. Our alumni base, for example, encompasses every conceivable profession, and alumni give generously of their time to undergraduate students seeking experiential learning. A recent survey by the University's Wasserman Center for Career Development showed that 83 percent of graduating seniors in the College held a job or internship related to their field of interest during their undergraduate years. Many different types of opportunities are available to students; some are paid, some involve volunteerism on the part of a student, and some carry academic credit\u2014and all of these can be valuable. For the purpose of securing and making the most of such opportunities, students should consider the following criteria as a guide. For further information, contact the Wasserman Center for Career Development (133 East 13th Street, 2nd Floor; 212-998-4730). Career counselors are available by appointment at the Wasserman Center; appointments may also be made through the Wasserman Center to meet with a career counselor in the College offices (100 Washington Square East, 9th Floor). Paid Internships These are the most common form of intern- ship. Jobs related to a student's professional interests provide pay for the work that students are doing for the organization. Many companies and organizations provide part-time jobs that allow students to gain experience and to network in the field, while at the same time helping to alleviate the financial burden of being a college student. (Please note: Some for-profit companies ask students to volunteer, but allow it only if the student can earn academic credit. Many of these so-called internships do not relate directly to a student's academic work and are not worthy of academic credit in a discipline. In these cases, the company should consider provid-ing compensation for the work done by a student, thus making it a paid internship.) voluntary or c ommunity Service Certain organizations encourage students to work on a volunteer basis to gain experi-ence and to provide needed assistance to the organization. This type of arrangement is common, for example, in government and not-for-profit organizations. Such intern-ships are valued, sometimes even required, for admission to some professional schools, but the College awards no credit for them. credit-Bearing Internships A few departments offer academic intern- ships that directly advance a student's knowledge in the academic discipline and thus earn course credit. Such academic internships must be sponsored by an appropriate faculty member through an academic department and normally require close faculty supervision, significant research in addition to the practical work experience, a reporting of findings, and a formal assessment of the student's work. All such internships require permission of the department or program, and registration for them must be within the regular deadlines. Departments offering credit-bearing internships may restrict them to declared majors, since those students have the requisite background. Internship courses can be counted toward some majors but not toward others. Students should check rel- evant websites(and sections in this Bulletin) to learn more about the specific policies and procedures pertaining to credit-bearing internships in different CAS departments and programs. State Law and Credit-Bearing Internships Owing to recent changes in states' laws governing out-of-state entities and their right to award credit for certain educational experiences, including internships, within state boundaries (known as \"state autho-rization\"), CAS can only award credit for internships that take place in: Alaska Arizona California Connecticut District of Columbia (Washington, D.C.) Hawaii Idaho Illinois Indiana Louisiana Maine Michigan Montana Nebraska New Jersey New York North Dakota Pennsylvania South Carolina South Dakota Utah Virginia Wyoming The list above will be updated as NYU obtains authorization in other states.Independent Study In some departments, independent study that draws on the activity or environment of the internship may be a possibility. Like a credit-bearing internship, independent study requires a proposal by the student, careful guidance from a faculty member, and a body of work that can be evaluated for course credit. 452 PREPROFESSIONAL, A CCELERATED , AND SPECIALIZED PROGRAMS C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITY453 ARTS AND SCIENCE SUMMER AND WINTER PROGRAMS C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYArts and Science Summer and Winter Programs For information on all NYU summer programs, visit www.nyu.edu/summer.

Credit will be granted for most collegiate work completed with a grade of C or better within the last 10 years that satisfies degree requirements and that falls within the residency requirement, with the exception of certain courses of a voca- tional nature or courses not consistent with the educational objectives of the College. Within these provisions, applicants from regionally accredited colleges are eligible for admission. Except when specifically noted, the general procedures described for entering freshmen apply to all applicants seeking to transfer from other two-year or four-year regionally accredited institutions. T ransfer applicants must submit official credentials from all institutions attended, including secondary school transcripts. T ransfer applicants who took the SAT or ACT exams while in high school should submit their test results as part of their application.

All transfer applicants are encouraged to submit scores from two SAT Subject Tests if previously taken while in high school.within two to three weeks of receiving an admission offer. Students are then restricted from filing any new applications and are expected to withdraw any active applica-tions to other schools. Providing that a student has completed the CSS PROFILE online, the student will be provided with a financial aid estimate soon after the student is offered admission. Again, admitted stu- dents will have roughly two to three weeks to review their financial aid package before confirming their enrollment at NYU. The FAFSA becomes available on January 1st and should be completed by admitted Early Decision candidates after submitting an enrollment deposit. We believe that part of our commitment to Early Decision applicants is indeed to provide an early decision; for that reason, we typically either admit or deny Early Decision candidates. early d ecision and f inancial a id NYU uses the same methodology in providing financial aid for Early Decision candidates as we do in providing financial aid for Regular Decision candidates. Students are not offered more or less financial aid based on when they apply for admission. For Early Decision I candidates, we use information students share with us via the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE online to provide admitted students with an estimated financial aid package after December 15th. For Early Decision II candidates, we use this information to provide admitted students with an estimated financial aid package after February 15th. Students are then provided with their official financial aid award in late April, assuming students have completed their Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) by February 15th. Students will only be released from the Early Decision agreement if they believe their estimated financial aid package does not enable them to attend. Students must be aware that applying Early Decision will not enable them to compare financial aid packages from other universities. If comparing financial aid packages will be necessary for a student, the student should apply under our Regular Decision program. NYU will still reserve the majority of our admission offers for students applying for Regular Decision, so students should not feel pressure to apply Early Decision if finances are of concern. early d ecision a pplication Process 1.

It also offers the Advanced Workshop Program in English for students with substantial English proficiency but insufficient profi- ciency for undertaking a full-time academic program. Qualified students in this program can often combine English study with a part-time academic program. This combina- tion may constitute a full-time program of study. The institute also offers specialized courses in accent reduction, grammar, and American business English. Individuals who wish to obtain additional information about the American Language Institute are invited to visit the office of the American Language Institute weekdays throughout the year between the hours of 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. (Fridays until 5 p.m.). They may also visit the website; contact The American Language Institute, School of Continuing and Professional Studies, New York University, 7 East 12th Street, Suite 821, New York, NY 10003; telephone: 212-998-7040; fax: 212-995-4135; or e-mail: ali@nyu.edu.Application for Certificate of Eligibility (AFCOE) online will be included in the acceptance packet. Appropriate evidence of financial ability must be submitted with the AFCOE to the Office for International Students and Scholars in order for the appropriate visa document to be issued. If the applicant's studies are being financed by means of his or her own savings, parental support, outside private or government scholarships, or any combination of these, he or she must arrange to send official letters or similar certification as proof of such support. New students may wish to view the multimedia tutorial for new international students.468 ADMISSION C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYadvaNced ST aNdINg Credit may be awarded for satisfactory work completed at another accredited college or university. When a transfer applicant is admitted to the College, the applicant's records are examined carefully to determine how much, if any, advanced standing will be granted. Each individual course completed elsewhere is evaluated. In granting advanced standing, the following are considered: the content, complexity, and grading standards of courses taken elsewhere; individual grades and grade averages attained by the applicant; the suitability of courses taken elsewhere for the program of study chosen here; and the degree of preparation that completed courses provide for more advanced study here. Point credit toward the degree is given only for a grade of C or better and provided that the credit fits into the selected program of study and courses were completed within the past 10 years. Quarter hours will be converted to semester hours to determine the number of credits transferable to NYU. Credits based on semester hours will be transferred at face value to NYU. As with all other students, transfer students are required to fulfill the residency require-ment. All degree candidates are subject to the following residency requirement: They must complete at least 64 consecutive points of course work in residence at the College immediately preceding the date of graduation and are permitted to transfer a maximum of 64 credits to NYU. A tentative statement of advanced standing is provided to each transfer student upon notification of admission to the College. A final statement of advanced standing is provided during the student's first semester of matriculation. Requests for reevaluation of transfer credit must be made within the semester during which the final statement of advanced standing is received. Thereafter, a student's advanced standing credits may be changed only with the written permis-sion of the Office of the Dean.NYU J aNU arY Term New York University's January Term allows students more flexibility and new scheduling options. NYU students, visiting students, and international students have the opportunity to earn major/minor credit or explore a new interest. During this time, students can take advantage of intensive study at one of the foremost research and teaching universities in the United States, as well as have a chance to enjoy New York City during a bustling and exciting time of year. Oftentimes, the fall and spring semesters can be overly hectic for students, consider-ing a full-time course load, student club responsibilities, work, and internship commitments. This busy time doesn't always allow the freedom to explore a new academic interest or take advantage of the many cultural resources that originally drew them to New York City. January Term pro- vides an array of courses enabling students to earn academic credit (major, minor, or elective) in courses that are in high demand, to accelerate degree completion, and to concentrate on personal interests. Further information is available at www.nyu.edu/winter.NYU SPrINg IN NeW Y orK NYU Spring in New York offers col- lege students from other institutions an opportunity to earn college credit and to experience academic life at New York University. Spring in New York participants enroll in one of eight areas of study, in courses with NYU students and taught by NYU faculty.In addition to classroom learning, NYU Spring in New York students have access to the same opportunities and benefits as NYU students: library access, sports center access, and program office events, includ- ing ticket discounts for Broadway shows, concerts, and sporting events. They are also encouraged to participate in planned excursions around the city.The program is offered to students currently matriculated and in good standing at an accredited college or university (within the United States) with a competitive grade point average. Students must have at least sophomore standing in the academic year of participation.

This section provides information on both of these distinct but related topics.Tuition, Fees, and Financial Aid TUITIoN aNd feeS: 2013-2014 Following is the schedule of fees established by the Board of T rustees of New York University for the year 2013-2014. The Board of T rustees reserves the right to alter this schedule without notice. T uition, fees, and expenses may be expected to increase in subsequent years and will be listed in online updates to this Bulletin at bulletin.cas.nyu. edu. Students should also consult www.nyu. edu/bursar for this updated information. Note that the registration and services fee covers membership, dues, etc., to the student's class organization and entitles the student to membership in such University activities as are supported by this allocation and to receive regularly those University and College publications that are supported in whole or in part by the student activities fund. It also includes the University's health services, emergency and accident coverage, and technology fees. Note: Deposits may be required for labora- tory courses. Students should consult the respective departments for information. All fees are payable at the time of registra- tion. The Office of the Bursar is located at 25 West Fourth Street. Checks and drafts are to be drawn to the order of New York University for the exact amount of the tuition and fees required. In the case of overpayment, the balance is refunded on request by filing a refund application in the Office of the Bursar. A fee will be charged if payment is not made by the due date indicated on the student's statement.

This plan is avail-able to students who meet the following eligibility requirements: Matriculated and registered for 6 or more points Without a previously unsatisfactory University credit record Not in arrears (past due) for any University charge or loan The plan includes a nonrefundable applica- tion fee of $50, which is to be included with the initial payment on the payment due date. Interest at a rate of 1 percent per month on the unpaid balance will be assessed if payment is not made in full by the final installment due date. A late payment fee will be assessed on any late payments. A separate deferred payment plan applica- tion and agreement is required for each semester this plan is used. The deferred payment plan will be available at www.nyu.edu/bursar/forms in July for the fall semester and in December for the spring semester.

The plan is open to all NYU students with the exception of the SCPS noncredit division. This interest-free plan allows for all or a portion of a student's edu-cational expenses (including tuition, fees, room, and board) to be paid in monthly installments. The traditional University billing cycle consists of one large lump-sum payment due at the beginning of each semester. T uitionPay is a budget plan that enables a family to spread payments over the course of the academic year. By enrolling in this plan, you spread your fall semester tuition payments over a four-month period (June through September) and your spring semester tuition payment over another four-month period (November through February). With this plan, you budget the cost of your tuition and/or housing, after deducting any financial aid you will be receiving and/ or any payments you have made directly to NYU. A nonrefundable enrollment fee of $50 is required when applying for the fall/spring T uitionPay plan. You must enroll in both the fall and spring plans. Monthly state- ments will be mailed by T uitionPay, and all payments should be made directly to them. For additional information, contact T uitionPay at 800-635-0120 or visit www. nyu.edu/bursar. arrears Policy The University reserves the right to deny registration and withhold all information regarding the record of any student who is in arrears in the payment of tuition, fees, loans, or other charges (including charges for housing, dining, or other activities or services) for as long as any arrears remain. diploma a rrears Policy Diplomas of students in arrears will be held until their financial obligations to the University are fulfilled and they have been cleared by the Bursar. Graduates with a diploma hold may contact the Office of the Bursar at 212-998-2806 to clear arrears or to discuss their financial status at the University.475 TUITION, FEES, AND FINANCIAL AID C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYA student who, for any reason, finds it impossible to complete one or more courses for which he or she has registered should consult with an academic adviser. An official withdrawal must be filed either on Albert (through the first two weeks of the term only) or in writing on a completed change of program (drop/add) form with the Office of the University Registrar. (Note: An official withdrawal must be filed if a course has been canceled, and, in this case, the student is entitled to a refund of tuition and registration fees paid.) Withdrawal does not necessarily entitle the student to a refund of tuition paid or a cancellation of tuition still due. A refund of tuition will be made provided such withdrawal is filed within the scheduled refund period for the term. (See the follow-ing schedules.) Merely ceasing to attend a class does not constitute official withdrawal, nor does notification to the instructor. A stop payment of a check presented for tuition does not constitute withdrawal, nor does it reduce the indebtedness to the University. The nonreturnable registration fee and a penalty fee of $20 for a stopped payment must be charged in addition to any tuition not canceled. The date on which the change of program form is filed, not the last date of attendance in class, is considered the official date of the student's withdrawal. It is this date that serves as the basis for computing any refund granted the student. The processing of refunds takes approximately two weeks. There are two distinct refund schedules (see below): 1. For students withdrawing from some courses, but not all; and 2. For students withdrawing from all courses. Undergraduate r efund Schedule, Withdrawing from Some c ourses ( fall and Spring only) Courses dropped during the first two weeks of the term: 100% (100% of tuition and fees)*Courses dropped after the first two weeks of the term: NONE The above refund schedule is not applicable to students whose registration remains within the flat-fee range of 12 to 18 points per term. * Note: All fees (including school-related fees) are nonreturnable after the second calendar week of the semester. Undergraduate r efund Schedule, Withdrawing from a ll courses ( fall and Spring o nly) This schedule is based on the total applicable charge for tuition, excluding nonreturnable fees and deposits. Withdrawal on or before the official opening date of the term: 100% (100% of tuition and fees) Withdrawal on the second day after the official opening date of the term through the end of the first calendar week: 100% (100% of tuition only) Note: The first calendar week consists of the first seven (7) calendar days beginning with the official opening date of the term (not the first day of the class meeting). Withdrawal within the second calendar week of the term: 70% (tuition only) Withdrawal within the third calendar week of the term: 55% (tuition only) Withdrawal within the fourth calendar week of the term: 25% (tuition only) Withdrawal after completion of the fourth calendar week of the term: NONE Note: All fees (including school-related fees) are nonreturnable after the official first day of the semester. Note: A student may not withdraw from a class after the ninth week of the fall or spring semester or in the last two weeks of each six-week summer session. Exceptions to the published refund schedule may be appealed in writing to the refund committee in the College Advising Center (Silver Center, 100 Washington Square East, Room 905; 212-998-8130) and should be supported by appropriate documentation regarding the circumstances that warrant consideration of an exception. Exceptions are rarely granted. Students who withdraw should review the \"refunds\" page on the Office of the Bursar's website, www. nyu.edu/bursar. Federal regulations require adjustments reducing financial aid if a student with- draws even after the NYU refund period. Financial aid amounts will be adjusted for students who withdraw through the ninth week of the semester and have received any federal grants or loans. This adjustment may result in the student's bill not being fully paid. NYU will bill the student for this difference. The student will be responsible for payment of this bill before returning to NYU and will remain responsible for payment even if he or she does not return to NYU. For any semester a student receives any aid, that semester will be counted in the satisfac-tory academic progress standard. This may require the student to make up credits before receiving any further aid. Please review the \"satisfactory academic progress\" standard on the Office of Financial Aid website, so as not to jeopardize future semesters of aid. Tuition Insurance The College strongly advises students to purchase tuition insurance to protect their investment in the event of withdrawal from courses beyond the published refund schedule. This insurance can be very helpful when unexpected situations cause a student to withdraw. Exceptions to the University's refund policy are rarely granted for withdrawals after the fourth week of the semester. Please contact A. W. G. Dewar, Inc.

Students complete their initial registration through Albert, the University's web regis- tration system, at home.nyu.edu. Students also use Albert to make later adjustments to their schedule.continuing Students Students currently enrolled in the College register early for the following semester\u2014in November for the spring term and in April for the fall term. Students who are currently enrolled or on an official leave of absence receive notification of the date and time when they can register. Before registering, students plan a provisional schedule and put it in the \"shopping cart\" function of Albert. They also discuss their program and courses with their adviser, who then clears them for registration. At the appointed time or thereafter, students access Albert and enter their courses into the Student Information System (SIS). Students should complete registration by paying their tuition and fees. Online tuition statements and payment options are available through the Office of the Bursar. New Students Newly admitted students receive detailed instructions about orientation and registration, as well as the name and contact information of an adviser in the College Advising Center to assist in academic planning, course selection, and registration. T ransfer students with a declared major also have an opportunity to discuss their program with a faculty member in their chosen major department. For preregistration immunization requirements, please see \"immunization requirements\" in the academic policies section of this Bulletin. college a dvising c enter The College Advising Center (Silver Center, 100 Washington Square East, Room 905; 212-998-8130; advising.cas.nyu.edu) offers a wide range of services and programs designed to meet the needs of a diverse student body. The advisers serve as a basic source of information about the degree requirements, policies, and procedures of the College. Academic and career development workshops are sponsored or cosponsored to assist students in planning academic programs, choosing a major, and negotiating registration. In addition, vari- ous cocurricular educational opportunities, from informal faculty talks to seminars and lectures, are arranged through the center. Support programs are available for African American and Latino students; interna-tional students; undecided students; and freshmen, sophomores, juniors, and seniors. All first-year students participate in the College Cohort Program (CCP). The CCP begins with a virtual advising and registra-tion process during the early summer, including selection of a Freshman Seminar, which is required for all CAS first-year students. The Freshman Seminar selected determines placement in a small advising cohort. There is also an extensive academic orientation and introduction to the CCP during Welcome Week. During fall of the first year, cohorts come together every other week for a \"cohort meeting,\" where they work closely with their academic adviser and a college leader (an upperclass mentor) exploring topics which form a foundation for exploring and engaging in the variety of academic and cultural offerings at NYU, through NYC, and within the Global Network University. Students can meet as often as they would like with their advisers individually outside the context of the cohort meeting and are required to meet for individual advising appointments prior to registration for the following semester. Cohorts continue meet-ing on a monthly basis through the spring semester of the first year. The assigned CAS adviser remains available to students throughout their undergraduate experience, and serves as the primary source for academic advising until the student declares a major. Advising for students who are transferring to CAS from another college or university begins once the College is notified that they have accepted admission. Students receive a transfer orientation workbook electronically and are in direct contact with an academic adviser to interpret their transfer credit report, assist with course selection, and answer all questions about degree require-ments and registration. T ransfer students are also invited to a special orientation session which provides additional information needed to make a smooth transition into the College.

Advisers also meet individually with students who want to discuss concerns or questions they may be having about the University. The advisers serve as a liaison with other offices and can make referrals when appropriate. The College Advising Center is thus the best place for students to visit when they are unsure of where to go for help. The College Advising Center is open weekdays from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. (Thursdays until 6 p.m.). departmental advisement Students who have declared a major go to their major's department for their primary advisement.

The program is designed to help students finance, through scholarship assistance, up to 100 percent of their out-of-pocket tuition and fees associ- ated with education programs that may exceed the Post-9/11 GI Bill tuition benefit, which will only pay up to the highest public in-state undergraduate tuition. Beginning in the 2009-2010 academic year, NYU has provided funds toward the tuition of each qualifying veteran who was admitted as a full-time undergraduate, with the VA matching NYU's tuition contribution for each student. To be eligible for the Yellow Ribbon benefits, an individual must be entitled to the maximum post-9/11 benefit. An individual may be eligible for the Yellow Ribbon Enhancement if: He/She served an aggregate period of active duty after September 10, 2001, of at least 36 months. He/She was honorably discharged from active duty for a service- connected disability and had served 30 continuous days after September 10, 2001. He/She is a dependent eligible for transfer of entitlement under the Post-9/11 GI Bill based on a veteran's service under the eligibility criteria, as described on the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs website. The Department of Veterans Affairs is currently accepting applications for the Post-9/11 GI Bill. To qualify for the Yellow Ribbon Enhancement, you must apply to the VA. The VA will then determine your eligibility for the Post-9/11 GI Bill and issue you a Certificate of Eligibility. Note: You can apply using the VA Form 22-1990. The form includes the instruc- tions needed to begin the process. After you are issued your Certificate of Eligibility from the Department of Veterans Affairs, indicating that you qualify for the Yellow Ribbon Program, please contact Ms. Clara Fonteboa at clf1@nyu.edu or 212-998-4823. The Office of the University Registrar must certify to the Department of Veterans Affairs that the eligible person is enrolled as a full-time undergraduate student for the funds to be paid under the Yellow Ribbon Program.

Readmitted students must fulfill the requirements as listed in the College of Arts and Science Bulletin published during the year of their readmission, unless their readmission letter states otherwise. In very exceptional cases, a student may petition the Committee on Undergraduate Academic Standards for approval of a change in the requirements as stated in the Bulletin. The petition form may be obtained from the Office of the Associate Dean for Students, Silver Center, Room 909; 212-998-8140. Degrees are conferred in September, January, and May. The formal conferring of degrees by the president of the University takes place annually at Commencement in May. Major requirements, varying from depart-ment to department, are specified in the sections of this Bulletin devoted to the course listings of individual departments and programs. Generally, a little more than one-third of the total points are earned in the major concentration.Every student must complete a major with a cumulative grade point average in the major of at least 2.0. At least one-half of the courses (and in some departments, at least one-half of the points) used to complete the major must be taken in the College of Arts and Science. A student may not register for courses in the major outside of NYU. The student must be accepted as a major in the department and must review his or her program with a department adviser each term. Students go to the office of the department or program to declare a major and have it posted in the Student Information System (Albert). Students who have earned 64 or more points must declare a major. Those with fewer than 64 points are strongly encouraged to declare a major as early in their academic career as possible.482 DEGREE REQUIREMENTS C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYThe mINor regUla TIoNS PerT aININg T o Bo Th maJor aNd mINor TIme lImIT reSIdeNce reQUIremeNT TraNSfer STUdeNTSStudents may take a double (second) major. The same requirements, including the maintenance of a minimum grade point average of 2.0, apply to the second major as to the first. In some cases, courses may be applicable to both majors. Students must then obtain the written approval for the shared course(s) from the directors of undergraduate studies of both departments. The second major is declared in the same way as the first (see above). The minor requirements are found in the departmental sections of the Bulletin. The minor must be completed with a minimum grade point average of 2.0. The minor is declared at the office of the sponsoring department or program. No more than one minor can be completed outside of the College in the other divisions of NYU, as the limit on non-CAS credits is set at 16 points. The major and minor requirements to be followed are those stated in the departmen-tal sections of the Bulletin in effect during the semester of the student's first registra- tion in the College. No credit toward the major or minor is granted for grades of C-minus or lower, although such grades will be computed into the grade point average of the major or the minor, as well as into the overall grade point average. No course to be counted toward the major or minor may be taken on a pass/fail basis. (See \"pass/fail option\" under academic policies in this Bulletin.)T ransfer students from other colleges and universities must have the written approval of the director of undergraduate studies to count transfer courses toward the major or the minor. Once a student transfers to the College, all course work must be completed at NYU. (See also \"transfer students,\" below.) All requirements for a degree in the College must be met within a period of eight years from the date of matriculation. For transfer students and for students who are readmit-ted to the College, the length of time is proportionately reduced. T ransfer credit is not granted for courses taken more than 10 years before the student's matriculation in the College. Once a student enrolls in the College of Arts and Science (first year and/or transfer), all course work used to satisfy the 128-credit degree requirement must be completed at NYU. All students must complete their last 32 points while registered in the College of Arts and Science. In addition, students must be registered in the College during the semester immediately prior to graduation, unless officially approved for a leave of absence in that semester. One-half of the courses used to complete the major or the minor must be taken in the College. Any transfer courses to be applied toward major or minor requirements must be approved by the department.doUBle maJor T ransfer students must complete 64 points in the College of Arts and Science with a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.0 overall, in the required major, and in the optional minor. At least one-half of the courses used to complete the major and any minor must be courses offered by the College. Any transfer courses to be applied toward major or minor requirements must be approved by the department and may not exceed one-half of the required coursework for the major or minor. Courses in which a grade of C-minus or lower was obtained are not transferable. Grades earned from external transfer courses are not calculated in the NYU grade point average.483 ACADEMIC POLICIES C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYAcademic Policies academIc Program The programs and courses offered at the College of Arts and Science are designed for students who attend classes offered during the day on a full-time basis. A full-time schedule normally consists of 16 points per term, or 32 points per year, which enables a student to complete the entire program of 128 points in four years. Minimal full-time status entails completing at least 12 points per term, or 24 points per year. Students who wish to attend part time should obtain permission from the Office of the Associate Dean for Students, Silver Center, Room 909; 212-998-8140. Such status will be granted only when there is good and sufficient reason for part-time study. Failure to complete a minimum of 24 points per year jeopardizes a student's full-time status. Failure to complete 32 points per year may jeopardize a student's eligibility to receive financial aid; students should discuss their situation with the Office of Financial Aid in the Student Services Center, 25 West Fourth Street. Students in good academic standing may register for more than 18 points per term with the approval and clearance of their academic adviser. Students on academic probation, however, who wish to register for more than 18 points per term must obtain the prior approval of the Committee on Undergraduate Academic Standards, as must any other student wishing to register for more than 20 points. change of Program To make any changes in their program, including dropping or adding courses given in other divisions of the University, students must access Albert via NYUHome at home. nyu.edu or file a change of program (\"drop/ add\") form with the Office of the Registrar in the Student Services Center, 25 West Fourth Street. adding c ourses The deadline for the adding of a course or a section is the end of the second week of the semester. The deadline applies to any course added by a College of Arts and Science student and to any College of Arts and Science course added by students from other divisions. The adding of any course or section after the end of the second week is generally allowed only when the student is changing levels within a discipline\u2014for example, from a French or mathematics course to a higher- or lower-level course in the same discipline. The addition is permit- ted only with the written approval of both the instructor and a CAS dean. dropping and Withdrawing from courses Students are expected to maintain a full-time program as described above. Occasionally, they may withdraw from a course if, because of reasons beyond their control, they cannot continue. Courses dropped during the first three weeks of the term will not appear on the transcript. Those dropped from the beginning of the fourth week through the end of the ninth week of the term will be recorded with a grade of W. After the ninth week, no one may withdraw from a course. Students who are ill or have a serious personal problem should see, call, or write to an adviser in the College Advising Center, College of Arts and Science, New York University, Silver Center, 100 Washington Square East, Room 905, New York, NY 10003-6688; 212-998-8130. complete Withdrawals Students who wish to withdraw from all their courses must make an appointment for an interview with an adviser in the College Advising Center. A student who withdraws officially from all courses in a term may register for the following term. If the student is unable to attend the College during the term following the withdrawal, he or she should discuss a leave of absence from an adviser in the College Advising Center. For more information, see \"attendance,\" below. auditing Matriculated students in the College may audit (i.e., attend lectures without intending to receive credit) any course in the College with the consent of, and under the conditions established by, the instruc- tor and the department. Auditors may not preempt space required for registered students. Courses cannot be audited as a means of satisfying requirements for an incomplete grade or as a means of changing a previous grade. A student cannot register as an auditor, and audited courses will not appear on the student's official transcript. Special (nonde- gree) students may not audit courses. aTTeNdaNce Although the administration of the College does not supervise attendance of classes, it supports the standards imposed by instructors.Students who, in the judgment of the instructor, have not substantially met the requirements of the course or who have been excessively absent may be considered to have withdrawn unofficially and may be given the final grade of F . See \"withdrawing from courses,\" above. religious h olidays and attendance New York University, as a nonsectarian institution, adheres to the general policy of including in its official calendar only certain legal holidays. However, it has also long been University policy that members of any religious group may, without penalty, absent themselves from classes when compliance with their religious obligations requires it. In 1988, the University Senate affirmed this policy and passed a resolution that elaborated on it as follows: Students who anticipate being absent because of any religious observance should, whenever possible, notify faculty in advance of such anticipated absence. Whenever feasible, examinations and assignment deadlines should not be sched- uled on religious holidays. Any student absent from class because of religious beliefs shall not be penalized for any class, examination, or assignment deadline missed on that day or days. If examinations or assignment deadlines are scheduled, any student who is unable to attend class because of religious beliefs shall be given the opportunity to make up that day or days. No adverse or prejudicial effects shall result to any student who avails himself or herself of the above provisions. 484 ACADEMIC POLICIES C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYleave of aBSeNce general l eave If a student and an adviser agree that a leave of absence is the best way to proceed given the student's situation, the adviser will assist in the withdrawal from the semester and extended time for a leave of absence. A student needs to make an appointment with an adviser to discuss his or her par- ticular situation and review the terms of the leave of absence; please contact the College Advising Center, Silver Center, Room 905; 212-998-8130. A student may request a leave of absence for the fall/spring semester, and must make his or her request prior to the end of the third week of the semester he or she wishes to be on leave. A student who requests a leave after that deadline or who has been out of attendance without first being granted a leave must apply for readmission. Also note that leaves are not granted retroactively for past semesters. There are no leaves of absence for the summer and January terms, as enrollment during these terms is not required to maintain matriculation in the College. A student granted a leave does not have to make a formal application for readmission as long as he or she returns to the College within the agreed-upon time (a maximum of two semesters during a student's aca-demic career). Students who attend another college during the leave must petition to have the credits transferred after they have been approved to return to the College. Petitions may be obtained at the Office of the Associate Dean for Students, Silver Center, Room 909; 212-998-8140. Students are advised to inquire how the leave of absence may affect their scholarship and financial aid award and should contact the Office of Financial Aid at 25 West Fourth Street. If students are on probation when the leave is granted, they will return on probation. Students out of attendance who did not apply for a leave and who wish to return to the College must apply for readmission. (See the admission section of this Bulletin.) Psychological and m edical l eave If a student and a counselor or a physician agree that a psychological or medical leave of absence is the best way to proceed given the situation, the counselor or physician should make a recommendation to the associate dean for students at the College for the withdrawal from the semester and extended time for a leave of absence. A stu- dent needs to complete the leave of absence petition form, which can be obtained at the Office of the Associate Dean for Students, Silver Center, Room 909; 212-998-8140. Leave of absence petitions are accepted and reviewed on a rolling basis throughout the academic year. A certification of readiness to return to school from a leave of absence form should be completed by the counselor/therapist or physician, who needs to state clearly that the student is ready to return and that NYU is a suitable environment in which to continue his or her academic work. The student must also schedule an appointment with a counselor/therapist or physician at the NYU Student Health Center prior to receiving approval from the College to return. A student granted a leave does not have to make a formal application for readmission as long as he or she returns to the College within the agreed-upon time (a maximum of two semesters during a student's academic career). Students who attend another college during the leave must petition to have the credits transferred after they have been approved to return to the College. Petitions may be obtained at the Office of the Associate Dean for Students, Silver Center, Room 909; 212-998-8140. Students are advised to inquire how the leave of absence may affect their scholarship and financial aid award and should contact the Office of Financial Aid at 25 West Fourth Street. If students are on probation when the leave is granted, they will return on probation. Students out of attendance who did not apply for a leave and who wish to return to the College must apply for readmission. (See the admission section of this Bulletin.)485 ACADEMIC POLICIES C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYcredIT credit for a dvanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, a level, and o ther e xaminations The College participates in the Advanced Placement Program of the College Entrance Examination Board. Students who have taken Advanced Placement exams while in high school should have the Educational Testing Service in Princeton, N.J., forward their official scores to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions, 665 Broadway, 11th Floor, New York, NY 10012-2339. No credit is given for AP tests taken after the completion of high school. In most sub-jects, if the score received is 4 or 5, credit will be granted. The AP credit will be lost, however, if a student takes the equivalent course for credit in the College. For more information, see the \"advanced placement equivalencies\" chart in the admission sec-tion of this Bulletin. For information on IB, A Level, and the other international examinations for which CAS awards credit (minimum scores, course equivalencies, etc.), please see \"credit by examination\" and charts in the admis-sion section of this Bulletin. The maximum number of credits allowed toward the degree requirements of the College that are a result of any possible combination of nonresident special exami- nation programs (plus previous coursework, if applicable and approved) shall not exceed a total of 32. credit for c ourses in the c ollege To receive credit for a course, the student must register before attending, meet the requirements for attendance, and creditably complete all examinations and assignments prescribed by the instructor. For exceptional students, most departments also offer independent study. The College does not permit students to register as auditors. restrictions on r eceiving c redit (Including c ourse r epeat Policy) For students who matriculate in or are re-admitted to the College of Arts and Science in fall 2012 and thereafter: A student who has taken a course for credit or who has obtained a W in a course is permitted to repeat that course once. Students may not repeat more than two courses during their undergraduate careers. Students may not repeat courses in a designated sequence after taking more advanced courses. The departments deter- mine the sequencing of courses. Students with questions regarding the repetition of courses or course sequences must consult with the particular department offering the course. When a student repeats a course, no additional credit will be awarded. Both grades will be recorded and computed in the grade point average. (Students who entered CAS before fall 2012 should consult this section of the CAS Bulletin for the year they matriculated in the College to find the course repeat policy applicable to them.) A limited number of credits may be earned by those in the military services who take correspondence courses in colleges approved by the United States Armed Forces Institute. Students may not be registered at another university at the same time that they are registered in the College of Arts and Science. credit for c ourses at o ther Schools and d ivisions of New York University Courses may be taken in the New York University Graduate School of Arts and Science. 1000-level graduate courses may be taken as described in the departmental sections of this bulletin, and 2000-level graduate courses may be taken with written approval of the instructor. If graduate courses are applied toward the completion of requirements for the baccalaureate degree, no advanced credit is allowed for them in the Graduate School of Arts and Science. It is also possible for students to take courses in other undergraduate divisions of New York University and to have credits for these courses applied to the degree in the College. Students may take a total of 16 points in other divisions, including any courses for particular minors approved by the College. T ransfer students should note that credits for non-liberal-arts courses (e.g., business, applied art, speech) taken at another institution count as part of the 16 points. Students seeking additional non-liberal-arts credits beyond the 16-point limit must file a petition with the Committee on Undergraduate Academic Standards in the Office of the Associate Dean for Students, Silver Center, Room 909; 212-998-8140. Please note that restrictions apply. Courses in other divisions that duplicate the contents of a College of Arts and Science course do not count toward the College degree. For details, students must check with an adviser in the College Advising Center before registering for any courses in other divisions. If a course is not approved, students will not receive credit for it. Independent study or internship courses taken in other divisions of the University do not count toward the College degree. If such courses are taken at schools outside the University, the credit will not transfer to the College. Also excluded from credit toward the degree are any courses taken in the School of Continuing and Professional Studies once a student is registered in the College. Credit for online courses will not be counted toward the baccalaureate degree. Summer c redits Once admitted to the College, students must take all courses here, including those they need or wish to take during the summer. Exceptions are granted only rarely and only for good academic reasons. Requests for a waiver should be made by submitting a petition to the Committee on Undergraduate Academic Standards in the Office of the Associate Dean for Students, Silver Center, Room 909; 212-998-8140. Information about NYU summer course offerings is available during the preceding fall and spring terms, as is information about dormitory facilities available to students who usually commute. credit for Independent Study Most departments offer independent study courses for students with exceptional qualifications. In these courses, the work is 486 ACADEMIC POLICIES C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYplanned specifically for each student. Independent study courses allow the student to work independently with faculty supervision and counsel. The courses typically carry variable credit of 2 or 4 points each term. They are normally limited to upper-class majors but may be open to other well-qualified students. To register for independent study, a student must have written approval of the director of undergraduate studies of the department in which the course is offered. The result of the independent study course should be a paper or objective, tangible evidence of completion of the work. The individual departments may grant credit for not more than 8 points of independent study for work approved in advance. In general, students are not permitted to take more than 12 points of independent study and/ or internship, and no more than 8 points may be taken in any one department. Internships and/or independent study courses taken in other divisions of the University or at other universities do not count toward the College degree. More specific information can be found under the individual departmental sections. credit for Transfer Students Students are allowed to transfer up to 64 credits to the College. Credits based on semester hours are accepted from other institutions at face value and are not altered when they are transferred into the College. Quarter hours will be converted to semester hours to determine the number of credits transferable to the College of Arts and Science. Non-liberal-arts credits are not always transferable, and transfer credit is never awarded for independent study or internship courses. Only credits for course work taken with a grade of C or better will be transferred. Courses taken for a pass/fail grade will not transfer to the College.credit for Non-NYU Study a broad Credits based on semester hours (similar to schools in the United States) are accepted from institutions abroad at face value and are not altered when the credits transfer into the College. Often credits from institu- tions abroad must be adjusted or converted to correspond to the College's requirements for awarding credits. Approval to partici- pate in a non-NYU study abroad is only obtained by completing an academic pro- posal. The packet of information required to complete the proposal is available at the Office of the Associate Dean for Students, Silver Center, Room 909; 212-998-8140. When students receive approval to partici- pate in a non-NYU program abroad, the specific courses they will take are approved and the number of transfer credits they will receive are specified. eXamINa TIoNS aNd gradeS missed and m akeup examinations As noted under \"grades,\" below, a student who cannot take the final examination in a course at the regularly scheduled time may be given the grade of Incomplete. The student must discuss the reasons for missing the examination with the instructor and, in the case of illness, must submit a doctor's note to the instructor. The student must ask the instructor to give a grade of Incomplete. Incompletes are not awarded automati- cally. The time and place of any makeup examinations are set by the instructor or the department. Incomplete grades received because of a missed final examination must be removed within the semester following the one in which the Incomplete was received. In the case of students who are out of attendance, such grades must be removed within one year after the end of the course concerned. A grade of Incomplete that is not removed within this time limit becomes an F and is computed in the grade point average. (Regarding the removal of Incompletes received for missed work other than final examinations, see under \"grades\" and \"incompletes,\" below.) grades Students may obtain their final grades for each semester on Albert via NYUHome at home.nyu.edu. The parents or guardian of a student who is a minor (under 18 years of age) may, on a written request to the Office of the University Registrar, obtain the student's grades at any time. The following symbols indicating grades are used: A, B, C, D, P , F , and W. The fol- lowing symbol indicates incomplete work: I. Only grades of A, B, C, D, or F earned in any New York University course while matriculated in the College, or earned in any of the College's courses (courses suffixed by \"-UA\") while matriculated in another division of the University, are computed in the average. The following grades may be awarded: A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D+, D, F . In general, A indicates excellent work, B indicates good work, C indicates satisfac- tory work, and D indicates passable work and is the lowest passing grade. F indicates failure. The weights assigned in computing the grade point average are as follows: A = 4.0 A- = 3.7 B+ = 3.3 B = 3.0 B- = 2.7 C+ = 2.3 C = 2.0 C- = 1.7 D+ = 1.3 D = 1.0 F = 0.0 Computing the Grade Point Average The grade point average can be obtained by determining the total of all grade points earned (quality points) and dividing that figure by the total number of credit hours completed (quality hours). For example: A student who has completed 8 points of A (4.0), 4 points of B (3.0), and 4 points of C (2.0) has a grade point average of 3.25. This is obtained by adding 8 (points of A) x 4.0 (point value of A), 4 (points of B) x 3.0 (point value of B), and 487 ACADEMIC POLICIES C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITY4 (points of C) x 2.0 (point value of C), which totals 52 (the total of all grade points earned), and then by dividing 52 by 16 (the total number of credit hours completed). This gives the grade point average of 3.25. Policies on Assigned Grades Once a final grade has been submitted by the instructor and recorded on the tran- script, the final grade cannot be changed by turning in additional course work. To appeal an assigned grade, the student should first consult with the instructor who assigned the grade to discuss the grading requirements for the course and how the grade was determined. If the student is not satisfied with the outcome of the discussion and wishes to appeal the grade further, a formal written appeal should be submitted to the chair and/or director of undergradu-ate studies in the particular department. An independent review of the grade will be undertaken by the department. All of the student's work will be reviewed to clarify how the grade was determined and to ensure the grade is consistent with the academic guidelines and policies of the department. The decision of the depart- ment in matters related to a course grade is final. In the case of a course that has been repeated, for students who matriculated in CAS before fall 2012: only the second grade, whether higher or lower, is computed into the grade point average. The initial grade, however, remains on the transcript. In the case of a course that has been repeated, for students who matriculate in or are re-admitted to CAS in fall 2012 and thereafter: both grades will be recorded on the transcript and both grades will be computed in the grade point average. The grades for courses taken abroad in one of New York University's programs or at one of the exchange sites are recorded on the transcript and are also included in the grade point average. The grades for graduate and professional courses taken at other divisions in the University are included in the grade point average, provided that permission to enroll is obtained prior to registration for the courses.Not included in the undergraduate grade point average are grades for the first year of professional courses taken by those students in the three-year accelerated dental program and grades for work done at institutions other than New York University (except for exchange sites abroad). Grade of P The grade of P (Pass) indicates a passing grade (A, B, C, or D) in a course taken under the pass/fail option. It is also used to indicate nongraded courses. The grade of P is not computed in the average. The grade of F under the pass/fail option is computed in the average. For more information and procedures to obtain the pass/fail option, see the section \"pass/fail option,\" below. Grade of W The grade of W indicates an official with-drawal of the student from a course in good academic standing. Please see \"change of program\" and \"withdrawing from courses,\" above, for information on the regulations and procedures for withdrawing officially from courses. Grade of I The grade of I (Incomplete) is a temporary grade that indicates that the student has, for good reason, not completed all of the course work but that there is the possibil-ity that the student will eventually pass the course when all of the requirements have been completed. A student must ask the instructor for a grade of I, present documented evidence of illness or the equivalent, and clarify the remaining course requirements with the instructor. The incomplete grade is not awarded automatically. It is not used when there is no possibility that the student will eventu- ally pass the course. If the course work is not completed after the statutory time for making up incompletes has elapsed, the temporary grade of I shall become an F and will be computed in the student's grade point average. Incompletes All work missed in the fall term must be made up by the end of the following spring term. All work missed in the spring term or in a summer session must be made up by the end of the following fall term. Students who are out of attendance in the semester following the one in which the course was taken have one year to complete the work. Students should contact the College Advising Center (Silver Center, Room 905; 212-998-8130) for an extension of incomplete form, which must be approved by the instructor. Extensions of these time limits are rarely granted. Pass/ fail o ption Students may elect one pass/fail option each term, including the summer sessions, for a total of not more than 32 points during their college career. The pass/fail option is not acceptable for courses completed at other institutions. The choice must be made before the completion of the fifth week of the term (second week of a six-week summer ses-sion); after that time, the decision cannot be initiated or changed. No grade other than P or F will be recorded for those students choosing this option. P includes the grades of A, B, C, and D and is not counted in the average. F is counted in the average. The pass/fail option is not acceptable in the major, the minor, or any of the courses taken in fulfillment of the College Core Curriculum requirements. Students con- sidering the pass/fail option in their area of study or in required preprofessional courses should consult with their advisers about the effect of such grades on admission to graduate and professional schools. Students who change their majors may not be able to use courses taken under the pass/fail option to satisfy the requirements of their new majors. To declare the pass/fail option before the fifth week of the semester or second week of a six-week summer session, students must consult with an adviser in the College Advising Center, Silver Center, Room 905; 212-998-8130. Advisers submit the request on students' behalf. 488 ACADEMIC POLICIES C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYPlacemeNT eX amINa TIoNS, degree ProgreSS, aNd TraNScrIPTS Placement e xaminations in foreign languages Most entering students take a placement test prior to their first registration in the College. Students who took a foreign-lan- guage SAT Subject test while in high school are encouraged to present the score instead of or in addition to taking the College's test. (Please consult the table on SAT Subject exams and the College Core Curriculum in the admission section of this Bulletin.) Placement exams for the following languages are accessible online: Cantonese, French, German, Greek (modern), Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Latin, Mandarin (traditional and simplified), Portuguese, Russian, and Spanish. To take an exam, go to http://cas.nyu.edu/page/placementexams and follow the appropriate links. Online exams in these languages are for placement only, not exemption. Eligibility to take an in-person, paper exam for exemption from the CAS foreign language requirement is determined by a student's score on the online placement exam. Some languages do not have online placement exams and are tested on paper: Tagalog (given centrally in CAS); Gaelic (Irish), arranged through Ireland House; and Arabic, T urkish, Persian, Hindi, and Urdu, all arranged through the Department of Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies. These written exams result either in an exemption from the foreign language requirement (see \"foreign language\" under College Core Curriculum in this Bulletin) or in placement into the appropriate-level course. Whether online or written, these are read- ing examinations; students should choose to be tested in the language in which they have good reading skills. Placement into a lower-level course means that the student must continue his or her studies of that language (or begin a new language) until completion of the intermediate two level of that language. In some cases, adjustments in placement may be made during the first weeks of class. Students who place at a level below that which they have completed at another college will lose transfer credit if they repeat foreign language course work at the College of Arts and Science. A foreign language examination is required of all entering students with the follow- ing exceptions: students who will begin a language they have not previously studied; students whose entire secondary schooling was in a language other than English and other than those languages taught in the College; and foreign students who complete the sequence of required Expository Writing courses for international students. Students in these categories should contact the College Advising Center to verify that they have satisfied the foreign language requirement. Information on foreign language placement and exemption testing can be obtained from the Office of Academic Affairs, Silver Center, 100 Washington Square East, Room 908; 212-998-8110; http://cas.nyu.edu/page/placementexams.

It is called \"academic requirements\" and is accessed through the Student Center. The degree progress report is a Student Information System (SIS) accounting of completed and remaining degree requirements. Transcripts of r ecord Unofficial transcripts are available on Albert, NYU's Web-based registration and information system. Albert can be accessed via NYUHome.Students requiring a stamped and sealed copy of their New York University records should request an official copy of their University transcript from the Office of the University Registrar. Requests for official transcripts require the signature of the student/alumnus requesting the transcript, unless the student/alumnus has a valid NetID. Current students and graduates with a valid NYU NetID (able to access NYUHome/ Albert) who attended NYU in or after 1990 can request an official transcript from the Albert Student Center.

Graduates with a diploma hold may contact the Office of the Bursar at 212-998-2806 to clear arrears or to discuss their financial status at the University. diploma application Students may officially graduate in September, January, or May. The all-Uni-versity Commencement ceremony is held in May. The College holds a baccalaureate ceremony in May. Students must apply for graduation on Albert, and they must be enrolled for either course work, leave of absence, or maintenance of matriculation during their final semester. To graduate in a specific semester, students must apply for graduation within the application deadline period indicated on the calendar available at the Office of the University Registrar's web page. It is recom- mended that students apply for graduation no later than the beginning of the semester in which they plan to complete all program requirements. Students who do not success- fully complete all academic requirements by the end of that semester must reapply for graduation for the following cycle. academIc ST aNdard S aNd dIScIPlINe academic Standards The Committee on Undergraduate Academic Standards reviews student records throughout the academic year. All of its actions are based on the grades to date at the end of the term. Academic AlertStudents with cumulative grade point aver- ages of 2.0 to 2.25 will receive an academic alert letter reflecting the committee's specific recommendations for achieving an appropriate standard for academic performance.Academic Probation Any student whose record is deemed unsatisfactory will be placed on academic probation and will be so informed by letter. A record will be deemed unsatisfactory if, in any semester, the cumulative or semester grade point average falls below 2.0 or if it fails to show steady and substantial progress toward the degree. Steady and substantial progress toward the degree entails the completion, with satisfactory grades, of more than half of the courses (and points) for which a student registers in any semester. In addition, it entails satisfactory progress in the student's major.Failure to satisfy the conditions of probation will result in further academic sanctions and possibly dismissal from the College. The conditions usually require that the student (a) achieve a grade point average of at least 2.0 during the term he or she is on probation, (b) not receive any grade below a C or any grade of I, and (c) not withdraw from any course without securing the permission of the Committee on Undergraduate Academic Standards prior to the withdrawal. Students on academic probation are also required to have a special probation interview with an adviser in the College Advising Center to 490 ACADEMIC POLICIES C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYreceive registration clearance for the next semester. More specific requirements may be imposed. The Committee on Undergraduate Academic Standards may summon students with unsatisfactory records to discuss their problems and to determine whether and under what conditions they may continue in the College. In special circumstances, the committee may recommend to the dean that students may be granted or placed on leave for a period not to exceed two semesters. Students on academic probation may not engage in any extracurricular activities (except for departmental clubs) and may not hold office in these clubs without the approval of the Committee on Undergraduate Academic Standards. Students on academic probation should be aware that they are usually ineligible for financial aid. Academic Dismissal Students who are dismissed from the College for poor academic performance will be informed via e-mail two to three weeks after their most recent grades are posted for the enrolled semester. Students who have paid tuition for the next term at the time of dismissal will receive a full refund of tuition and fees. academic Integrity Community of the Mind The College is a \"community of the mind.\" Its students, faculty, and staff all share the goal of pursuing truth through free and open inquiry, and we support one another's endeavors in this regard. As in any commu- nity, membership comes with certain rights and responsibilities. Foremost among these is academic integrity. Cheating on an exam, falsifying data, or having someone else write a paper undermines others who are \"doing it on their own\"; it makes it difficult or impossible to assess fairly a student's interest, aptitude, and achievement; and it diminishes the cheater, depriving him or her of an education. Most important, academic dishonesty is a violation of the very principles upon which the academy is founded. For this reason, violations of these principles are treated with the utmost seriousness.College of Arts and Science Honor Code As a student in the College of Arts and Science at New York University, you belong to a community of scholars who value free and open inquiry. Honest assessment of ideas and their sources is the foundation of what we do. Our University is a community of mutual trust and respect in which personal preju-dice has no part in the critical evaluation of ideas. It is a place where differences of opinion can be subjected to deliberate and reasonable examination without animus. As scholars, it is therefore as a matter of honor and good repute that we each commit ourselves to assuring the integrity of our academic community and of the educational pursuits we undertake together. As a student in the College, I pledge that: I shall perform honestly all my academic obligations. I will not represent the words, works, or ideas of others as my own; will not cheat; and will not seek to mislead faculty or other academic officers in their evaluation of my course work or in any other academic affairs. I shall behave with decorum and civility, and with respectful regard for all members of the University\u2014fac-ulty, staff, and fellow students\u2014our guests, and members of our wider communities. I shall abide by the College and by the University rules of conduct and policies on academic integrity and by the special requirements of any individual course of study or other academic activity. I shall endeavor earnestly to uphold the values, standards, and ideals on which our University community depends and call on others to do so. Procedures and Sanctions The penalty for academic dishonesty is severe. The following are the procedures as approved by the Faculty of Arts and Science. 1. If a student cheats on an examina-tion or in laboratory work or engages in plagiarism, appropriate disciplinary action should be taken. The department can take the fol- lowing actions:a. The faculty member, with the approval of the director of undergraduate studies (direc- tor), may reduce the student's grade or give the student an F in the course. b. If after lowering the grade or assigning an F the department believes a more severe penalty (i.e., probation, suspension, expulsion) is warranted, it can refer the case to the dean or his or her representative (associate dean for students) for further action. 2. In all cases of either (a) or (b), the director shall inform the depart- ment chair of any action in writing and send copies of this letter to the dean and to the student. The letter shall include the nature of the offense, the penalty, and the right of the student to appeal such penalty. A copy of the letter shall be kept in a confidential chairman's file and not in the student's departmental file. The dean's office copy shall also be kept in a confidential file. (The professor and/or the director is encouraged to meet with the student and discuss the nature of the offense and the action taken.) 3. For cases involving a first offense at New York University, the dean shall send the student by e-mail and first- class mail a notice that a second offense will result in a one-semester suspension or a more severe penalty. (The student is also called in to discuss the offense and review the consequences of the disciplinary action.) 4. For cases involving a second offense, the dean shall proceed as follows: a. Upon receiving a second direc-tor's letter concerning a given student, the dean shall convene a three-member ad hoc committee, with no member being from the department involved, to examine the evidence. This ad hoc commit-tee shall consider if there are reasonable grounds to believe that cheating/plagiarism has occurred and if so, shall affirm 491 ACADEMIC POLICIES C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYthe suspension penalty. It shall report its conclusion to the dean within three business days. b. If the committee affirms the suspension, the dean shall send the student by registered mail the suspension letter within two business days of receiving the report. The letter shall advise the student of his or her right to appeal. The student shall have two business days from the letter's delivery to request an appeal of the sus- pension as provided in section 5 (below). The suspension shall ordinarily be stayed during the pendency of appeal. c. If the committee does not affirm the suspension, the report shall be kept on file for a one-year period. 5. The student in all cases has the right to appeal to the dean. In the event of an appeal, the dean shall elicit a written complaint from the faculty member and proceed as described above. Discipline Students are expected to familiarize themselves and to comply with the rules of conduct, academic regulations, and established practices of the University and the College of Arts and Science, as stated in the student disciplinary procedures and as outlined in the chapter \"University Policies and Procedures\" in the NYU Student's Guide. If, pursuant to such rules, regulations, or practices, the withdrawal of a student is required before the end of the term for which tuition has been paid, a refund will be made according to the standard schedule for refunds. Below is a summary of the offenses for which students may be subject to disciplinary charges by the Committee on Student Discipline: 1. False representation or forgery of academic documents 2. Deliberate destruction, theft, or unauthorized use of laboratory data, research materials, computer resources, or university property 3. Disruption of an academic event 4. Actual or threatened violence or harassment Depending on the seriousness of the offense, the following penalties may be imposed after a hearing by the Committee on Student Discipline: Censure Written reprimand for violation of a speci-fied regulation, including the possibility of more severe disciplinary sanction in the event of a subsequent violation of any University regulation within a period of time stated in the letter of reprimand. Disciplinary Probation Suspension of privileges or exclusion from participating in extra-curricular University activities as set forth by the Committee on Student Discipline for a specified period of time. Suspension Exclusion from classes, as well as suspen-sion of privileges and exclusion from other activities, as set forth in the notice of suspension for a definite period of time. A student who has been suspended and who is found \"not guilty\" shall be allowed full opportunity to make up whatever work was missed because of the suspension. Dismissal Termination of student status for an indefi- nite period. The conditions for readmission, if any are permitted, shall be stated by the committee in the order of dismissal. If, as a result of disciplinary action, the withdrawal of a student is required before the end of the term for which tuition has been paid, a refund will be made according to the standard schedule for refunds. Student Grievance Students in the College of Arts and Science are referred to the \"student grievance procedure\" applicable to all the schools of New York University as found in the NYU Student's Guide. The College adheres to all articles of the \"student grievance procedure\" as set forth in the \"University Policies and Procedures\" section of the NYU Student's Guide. UNIverSITY PolIcIeS aNd camPUS S afeTY University Policy on Patents Students offered research opportunities are reminded that inventions arising from participation in such research are governed by the University's \"statement of policy on patents,\" a copy of which may be found in the Faculty Handbook or obtained from the dean's office. Immunization requirements New York State Public Health Law (NYS PHL) 2165 requires all students registering for 6 or more credits in a degree-granting program to provide immunization docu- mentation for measles (rubeola), mumps, and rubella (German measles) prior to registration. Students born before January 1, 1957, are exempt. New students should PeTITIoNS The Faculty Committee on Undergraduate Academic Standards will consider petitions from students to waive requirements or modify policies and regulations of the College. Students should be aware that only very exceptional cases, supported by valid and documented reasons, will be consid- ered. After deliberation, the committee's decisions on such matters are final. Petition forms may be obtained in the Office of the Associate Dean for Students, Silver Center, Room 909; 212-998-8140.492 ACADEMIC POLICIES C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYcomplete the MMR section of the student health history form. Continuing students should complete and submit a student immunization record form. New York State Public Health Law (NYS PHL) 2167 requires that all students registered for 6 or more credits submit a meningitis response form as formal confirmation of their decision as to whether or not to be immunized with the meningo- coccal (meningitis) vaccine. New students should complete the meningitis response section of the student health history form. Continuing students should complete and submit a meningitis response form. Failure to comply with state immuniza- tion laws will prevent NYU students from registering for classes. In addition to these requirements, the NYU Student Health Center recommends that students also consider hepatitis B and varicella immunizations. Students should discuss immunization options with their primary care provider. campus Safety The Department of Public Safety is located at 14 Washington Place; telephone: 212- 998-2222; 212-998-2220 (TTY). New York University's annual campus security report includes statistics for the previous three years concerning reported crimes that occurred on campus, in certain off-campus buildings or property owned or controlled by NYU, and on public property within or immediately adjacent to the cam-pus. The report also includes institutional policies concerning campus security, such as policies concerning sexual assault, drugs, and alcohol. Students may obtain a copy of the current report by contacting Thomas Grace, Director of Judicial Affairs and Compliance, Office of the Vice President for Student Affairs (601 Kimmel Center: 212-998-4403), or Jay Zwicker, Crime Prevention Manager, Department of Public Safety (7 Washington Place: 212-998- 1451), or by visiting the following website: www.nyu.edu/public.safety/policies. New York University Weapons Policy New York University strictly prohibits the possession of all weapons, as described in local, state, and federal statutes, including, but not limited to, firearms, knives, and explosives, in and/or around any and all University facilities\u2014academic, residential, or others. This prohibition extends to all buildings\u2014whether owned, leased, or controlled by the University, regardless of whether the bearer or possessor is licensed to carry that weapon. The possession of any weapon has the potential of creating a dangerous situation for the bearer and others. The only exceptions to this policy are duly authorized law enforcement personnel who are performing official federal, state, or local business and instances in which the bearer of the weapon is licensed by an appropriate licensing authority and has received written permission from the executive vice president of the University. New York University Simulated firearm Policy New York University strictly prohibits simulated firearms in and/or around any and all University facilities\u2014academic, resi- dential, or other. This prohibition extends to all buildings\u2014whether owned, leased, or controlled by the University. The possession of a simulated firearm has the potential of creating a dangerous situation for the bearer and others. The only exceptions to this policy are instances in which (1) the bearer is in possession of written permission from a dean, associate dean, assistant dean, or department head and (2) such possession or use of simulated firearms is directly connected to a University- or school-related event (e.g., play, film production). Whenever an approved simulated firearm is transported from one location to another, it must be placed in a secure container in such a manner that it cannot be observed. Storage of approved simulated firearms shall be the responsibility of the Department of Public Safety in a location designated by the vice president for public safety. Under no circumstances, other than at a Public Safety storage area, may approved simulated firearms be stored in any University-owned, -leased, or -controlled facilities.493 HONORS AND A WARDS C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYHonors and Awards dean's h onors l ist A Dean's Honors List is compiled at the end of each academic year, in June. This is an honors roll of matriculated students who have achieved an average of 3.65 or higher for that academic year (September to May) in at least 28 graded points. To be listed, a student must not have any grades of Incomplete or N at the time when the list is compiled. Note that grade point averages are carried to two decimal places (but are not rounded off). honorary Societies in a rts and Science Any student seeking to join a departmental scholastic honorary society is required to maintain, as a minimum scholastic require-ment for election to membership, a general average of 3.50, as well as an average in the major subject of 3.50. Students should consult with departmental advisers in regard to the specific requirements for the various departmental honor societies. Phi Beta Kappa Phi Beta Kappa celebrates and advocates excellence in the liberal arts and sciences. The Phi Beta Kappa Society invites for induction the most outstanding arts and science students in America's leading colleges and universities. NYU's College of Arts and Science chapter, the Beta of New York, was established in 1858. In terms of seniority, it ranks as the 15th oldest chapter of the Society. Each April, the faculty members of the Beta chapter automatically review the academic performance of all students in the College for eligibility for election to Phi Beta Kappa. eligibility for g raduation With l atin h onors To be graduated with honors, a student must have at least 64 points earned in courses from CAS, GSAS and selected Tisch departments. All graded courses taken while enrolled either in the College or in another school of NYU will be used in computing the grade point average on which Latin honors are based, as long as the 64 point residency requirement is met. Pass grades are not counted; grades received in courses taken at other institutions are also not counted. The student must also have a clean record of conduct. Effective with the September 2008 graduat- ing class, the GPA cutoffs for each category are determined by the combined GPA distribution from the preceding academic year, all graduation moments included. The cutoff for summa cum laude is the GPA included within the top 5 percent of the previous year's graduating class. The cutoff for magna cum laude is the GPA included within the next 10 percent of the previous year's class. The cutoff for cum laude is the GPA included within the next 15 percent of the previous year's class. For example, the necessary GPA level for summa cum laude for students graduating in September 2008 will be based on the GPA cutoff for the top 5 percent of the combined graduates from September 2007, January 2008, and May 2008.departmental honors Students who have completed at least 64 points of graded work in the College may be awarded degrees with departmental hon- ors if they complete the designated honors sequence in a department and maintain the requisite grade point average. There are two levels: honors and high honors. Students seeking admission to and graduation with departmental honors are expected to have a minimum grade point average of 3.65, both overall and in the major. Departments may exercise some flexibility in admissions, as follows. In rare cases where a candidate for admission to a departmental honors program falls short of the expected minimum GPA, the director of undergraduate studies or the director of departmental honors may petition the director of college honors for an exception. In all cases, once admitted, students are expected to maintain the GPA at the stipulated level in order to graduate with departmental honors. Should there be an exceptional circumstance in which the stipulated GPA is not maintained, the director of college honors may be petitioned for an exception. If the case is compelling, the latter will inform the registrar's office of the waiver. Honors programs must, minimally, be a two-term (8-point) experience that includes a capstone research project. The capstone project, which typically culminates in a thesis, should reflect sustained original research over two semesters. The scope and length of a thesis will vary by discipline, but the thesis is typically 40 to 60 pages in length.hoNorSMatriculated students with superior aca-demic records are honored in various ways, such as by placement on the Dean's Honors List, election to honor societies, and admission to departmental honors programs. Additional information may be obtained from departmental advisers and from the College Advising Center, Silver Center, Room 905; 212-998-8130.494 HONORS AND A WARDS C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYAll students completing departmental hon- ors must make public presentations of their work, preferably at the CAS Undergraduate Research Conference (URC) held at the end of the academic year, or in a departmental forum (e.g., oral defenses or presentations) held in conjunction with the URC. Students with double majors in discrete, unrelated disciplines must complete honors programs in each major for which they seek honors. Students with double majors in interdisciplinary or related fields may, if the two departments concur, convene a joint honors committee to establish an interdis- ciplinary research program of course work that culminates in a single thesis. Similarly, in the case of joint majors, the relevant departments must work out an agreement on the requirements for honors and on the supervision and evaluation of students' theses or projects. Presidential h onors Scholars Membership in the Presidential Honors Scholars at the College of Arts and Science offers outstanding students the opportunity to receive special advising from College faculty and staff, to challenge themselves in honors courses and through independent research, to study away, to take advantage of New York City's cultural resources, and to develop leadership skills through community service. Scholars comprise a distinguished group of undergraduates; only the top 10 percent of the entering class are chosen, and students who apply for entry after they have matriculated must demonstrate not only superlative academic achievements but also a consistent record of leadership and service to the community. Freshmen appointed on the basis of their high school records participate in a Scholars Seminar. They meet regularly for lectures and discussions and participate in a wide variety of cocurricular activities. These include the Scholars Lecture Series, cultural events in the city, social events, and com-munity service projects. During the January intersession, freshman scholars travel with faculty mentors to Villa La Pietra in Florence, Italy. Sophomore scholars also participate in a study away spring break, choosing a destination that most closely relates to their academic or personal interests. During their junior or senior year, scholars spend an entire semester (or year) studying at one of NYU's programs or exchanges away. In their junior and senior years, they also enroll in the honors track of their chosen major. In addition, Presidential Honors Scholars are committed to volun-teering and serving in the community. Membership in the Scholars Program is renewable annually, depending on the quality of the scholar's academic records and his or her level of participation in the program. All scholars are expected to be full-time students and maintain a grade point average of at least 3.65. Students who are not designated as Presidential Honors Scholars for the freshman year are invited to apply for membership at the end of the spring semester. Further information is available from the Office of the Associate Dean for Students, Silver Center, Room 909 (212-998-8140) or from the Office of Undergraduate Admissions, 665 Broadway, 11th Floor (212-998-4540). martin l uther King, Jr., Scholars Program Since its inception in 1987, the Martin Luther King, Jr., Scholars Program has awarded over 400 need-based and merit scholarships to incoming freshmen at NYU. These students present records of outstand- ing academic achievement, leadership, and commitment to the principles of commu-nity service, humanitarianism, and social progress. MLK Scholars help to plan and participate in academic and cultural events that draw on the vast resources of New York University and New York City. They explore cultural diversity through domestic and international travel and take the lead in helping others through community service. Women in Science Program The Women in Science (WINS) Program selects and supports a core group of talented, motivated women from each entering class who are interested in a career path focused on science and math research. These women, WINS Scholars, will have the opportunity to participate in a program of study, research, and mentoring spe- cifically tailored to their chosen academic path. WINS Scholars are offered certain specialized courses and invitations to events with notable women in the science and math professions, as well as both a financial scholarship and a research stipend. Information is available from the College's Preprofessional Center (Silver Center, Room 901; 212-998-8160). lewis r udin c ity Scholars Rudin Scholars are outstanding entering freshmen selected from public and parochial high schools in all five boroughs of New York City. In addition to their scholarship, the scholars participate in academic and cultural activities in New York City. The program is named in honor of the late real estate developer Lewis Rudin, former presi- dent of the Association for a Better New York and an NYU alumnus and trustee. departmental a wards and Prizes Africana Studies Prize Presented for excellence in this field.

Bus trips are organized by various clubs (such as the Art History, History, and Classics Clubs) to museums and private collections in other cities. Clubs associated with the sciences visit research laboratories, hospitals, and industrial plants. Students may become members of the Choral Arts Society, the NYU Concert Band, the NYU Jazz Ensembles, the NYU Orchestra, the NYU Woodwind Ensembles, the NYU Chamber Music Society, and Collegium Musicum.

In addition to the satisfaction they receive in helping their neighbors, they also gain valuable work experience. Through NYU's Office of Civic Engagement, students volunteer with dozens of not-for-profit organizations throughout New York City. Community service provides an opportu- nity to address major social, health, hunger, and environmental issues. Through service, students enhance their leadership skills, find fulfillment in giving back something to the community, and build new relationships while learning more about themselves. Service Activities There are many ways to become involved in activities on and off campus. Students in the College collect canned goods, conduct toy drives, and distribute bag lunches to the homeless. They work in dropout- prevention programs that encourage high school students to stay in school. They renovate houses and make them livable again. Students in the Presidential Scholars Program participate in ongoing service projects such as the Dean's Service Honor Corps, the University Settlement House, the Door, and the Beacon House. Whether their involvement is with the sick, the poor, or those who simply need a helping hand, student volunteers give of themselves freely. And they all agree that they get back much more than they give.502 STUDENT A CTIvITIES, UNIvERSITY SER vICES, AND C OMMUNITY SER vICE C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYTo strengthen and further support community-service initiatives, the University sponsors a central Office of Civic Engagement.

For more informa- tion, see the Cross-School Minors section of this Bulletin. This Bulletin contains descriptions of the College's departments, programs, and courses. The first part of every course number iden- tifies the department or program offering or cross-listing the course (for example, ARTH for art history). This is always followed by a two-letter suffix. The suffix \"UA\" indicates undergraduate courses offered in the College; \"GA\" indicates a graduate course offered by the Graduate School of Arts and Science. The numeric identifier comes last (for example, a complete course rubric would be ARTH-UA 677). Graduate courses open to qualified under - graduates are designated by the departments. The departmental policy in this matter may be indicated either in this Bulletin or in the Graduate School of Arts and Science Bulletin; interested students are also advised to check directly with the relevant departments. *HEGIS: Higher Education General Information Survey Degree and Certificate Programs as registered by the New York State Education Department.
