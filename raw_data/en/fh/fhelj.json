These terms all mean the same thing. When you have a fracture, it's not just the bone that's affected. You'll also have injured some of the soft tissues around it. Soft tissues include the: - muscles - ligaments - tendons - nerves Recovery times A clavicle fracture can take between 6 to 12 weeks to heal. It's normal to have aches and discomfort beyond this. It's also common for the area to be more sensitive for several months afterwards. What can affect your recovery? There are some things that might affect your recovery. Smoking Smoking affects all your tissues and slows facture healing times. In some people, it can stop healing altogether. Stopping smoking as your fracture heals will help to ensure the best recovery. General health Some medical conditions, like diabetes, may slow down the healing process. Eating a healthy diet and keeping yourself active will help your recovery. Medication Some medications can slow down fracture healing. If you have concerns about your medication talk to a healthcare professional. Anti-inflammatory medication, like Ibuprofen or Naproxen, have been shown to delay healing. What to expect after a clavicle fracture It's common for a lump to form around the injured area at your collar bone as the healing takes place. In many cases this will remain after your clavicle has healed. You don't need to seek help for this unless there is a change to the lump. Following your X-ray and diagnosis, your fracture will be managed in a Poly Sling.

Swelling It's normal to have swelling near the fracture site. It often spreads down your arm. Swelling can sometimes last for months. The amount of swelling can also change depending on: - your position - your activity - the time of day It's important that swelling is managed well to help your recovery. How to reduce swelling To help reduce the swelling you should: - keep the other joints in your arm moving normally - find a balance between rest and activity - Use self massage to reduce swelling - gently use your fingertips to push the fluid towards your shoulder Bruising It's normal to have bruising after a fracture. Bruising can be widespread and may appear a long way from your fracture. It can be very purple to start with and may change colour as you recover.

The areas affected can be: - other soft tissues - nearby joints - areas that have been immobilised Pain can change from day to day and it doesn't always depend on what you're doing.

Driving You should contact your insurance provider before driving. Your injury may affect your insurance. Once you're out of your sling, you must be able to safely perform an emergency stop or manoeuvre. You should always be in full control of your vehicle. Work Your return to work will depend on the type of work you do and your employer. It may be possible to discuss a phased return to work or changed duties. You don't need to see a healthcare professional to return to work. Daily activities Keep doing any activities you're able to, and as your pain allows. Gradually increase what you do. Reduced flexibility and strength may make things more difficult to start with. This will get better as you slowly build up to all your usual activities. Mood Frustration or [low mood](/healthy-living/mental-wellbeing#low-mood-and-depression) after an injury is normal. As you get back to normal life this should get better.
