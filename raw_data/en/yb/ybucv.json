Dietary Supplements in Adults Taking Cardiovascular Drugs. C omparative Effectiveness Review No. 51. (Prepared by the University of Ottawa Evidence- based Practice Center under Contract No. HHSA 290-2007- 10059-I.) AHRQ Publication No. 12- EHC021-EF. Rockville, MD: Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. April 2012. www.effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/reports/final.cfm. iii Preface The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) conducts the Effective Health Care Program as part of its mission to organize knowledge and make it available to inform decisions about health care. As part of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, Congress directed AHRQ to conduct and support research on the comparative outcomes, clinical effectiveness, and appropriateness of pharmaceuticals, devices, and health care services to meet the needs of Medicare, Medicaid, and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). AHRQ has an established network of Evidence- based Practice Centers (EPCs) that produce Evidence Reports/Technology Assessments to assist public- and private-sector organizations in their efforts to improve the quality of health care. The EPCs now lend their expertise to the Effective Health Care Program by conducting Comparative Effectiveness Reviews (CERs) of medications, devices, and other relevant interventions, including strategies for how these items and services can best be organized, managed, and delivered. Systematic reviews are the building blocks underlying evidence- based practice; th ey focus attention on the strength and limits of evidence from research studies about the effectiveness and safety of a clinical intervention. In the context of developing recommendations for practice, systematic reviews are useful because they define the strengths and limits of the evidence, clarifying whether assertions about the value of the intervention are based on strong evidence from clinical studies. For more information about systematic reviews, see http://www.effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/reference /purpose.cfm. AHRQ expects that CERs will be helpful to health plans, providers, purchasers, government programs, and the health care system as a whole. In addition, AHRQ is committed to presenting information in different formats so that consumers who make decisions about their own and their family's health can benefit from the evidence. Transparency and stakeholder input are essential to the Effective Health Care Program. Please visit the Web site (www.effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov) to see draft research questions and reports or to join an email list to learn about new program products and opportunities for input. Comparative Effectiveness Reviews will be updated regularly. We welcome comments on this CER.

A substantial proportion of patients with cardiovascular diseases use dietary supplements in anticipation of benefit. This also poses risks of adverse events from supplement- drug interactions and nonadherence associated with polypharmacy. Objectives . For supplements commonly used by patient s with cardiovascular disease, w e examined benefits , harms, and effects on cardiovascular drug pharmacokinetics of coadministration of dietary supplements with cardiovascular drugs. We also sought e vidence regarding variability among subgroups, and of stat istical interactions between supplements and drugs. Data Sources . We searched MEDLINE \u00ae, Embase, the Cochrane Library, International Bibliographic Information on Dietary Supplements (IBIDS), and Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED), as well as gray literature, from inception to September 2011. Study Selection. Following a predefined protocol, two reviewers included experimental and observational studies comparing a supplement plus cardiovascular drug versus drug alone published in English or G erman; other languages were excluded due to concerns with study quality and applicability. Data Extraction. One reviewer extracted data into a standardized electronic form, assessed study risk of bias, graded the strength of the body of evidence, and rep orted its applicability. Study risk of bias and strength of evidence regarding gradable outcomes were independently verified, as was a random 10 percent subset of all data. Data Synthesis. Sixty -seven randomized controlled trials , two controlled clinical trials , and one observational study contributed evidence of limited validity in highly selected populations. Evidence was insufficient for all gradable clinical efficacy and harms outcomes (e.g., mortality, thrombotic events, serious a dverse events ) because there were few , small studies per supplement. One pragmatic trial in women showed no benefit from co administering vitamin E with aspirin on a composite cardiovascular outcome. Evidence for most intermediate outcomes of efficacy was insufficient or of low strength and suggested no effect. Notable findings were incremental improvement of triglyceridemia with omega-3 fatty acid supplementation , stabilization of international normalized ratio with vitamin K added to warfarin therapy, and improved high - density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL -C) with added garlic. Clinically nonsignificant or otherwise inconclusive changes were noted for pharmacokinetic outcomes. Limitations . The evidence base principally consisted of underpowered short- term studies in selected populations, generally with moderate risk of bias. vii Conclusions . Limitations of the evidence base precluded meaningful conclusions across most supplement-drug combinations. Low-strength e vidence indicates benefits of omega- 3 fatty acids, vitamin K, and garlic co administration on specific intermediate outcomes. Evidence regarding harms was inconclusive. Care providers and researchers should query supplement use to improve care and to facilitate research regarding drug -supplement interactions . viii Contents Executive Summary ................................................................................................................

Data Extraction Forms ES-1 Executive Summary Background The American Heart Association estimates that more than 81 million American adults (one - third of all adults) have at least one form of cardiovascular disease (CVD).1 CVD is broadly defined to include all the disorders of the arterial system , including the heart and coronary arteries, the arterial supply to the brain, and the peripheral arterial system. CVD manifests typically as hypertension , angina, myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure, stroke and transient ischemic attack s (TIAs), and intermittent claudication or blockage. While there has been progress in the control of CVD, it demands huge investment s from the health care system , and represents great burdens and lost opportunities for individuals, families, and society overall. In addition to lifestyle and dietary recommendations, frontline treatment for prevention and treatment of CVD is primarily pharmaceutical, with patients requiring , on average , 6.3 concomitant prescription drugs from, on average, 5.9 different drug classes for primary and secondary prophylaxis of the disease itself and management of associated comorbidities.2-4 Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) refers to preventive and therapeutic modalities not generally considered to be part of conventional medicine,5 including dietary supplements. CAM utilization has increased dramatically in North America over the past decades in both the general and CVD populations. 6,7 The National Health Interview Survey indicated that Americans spent a total of $34 billion out of pocket on CAM in 2007.8 Estimates suggest that approximately one -third to two-thirds of people suffering from heart failure or other cardiovascular disease use dietary supplementation and are thus placed at risk for potential adverse events from interactions with other pharmacologically active agents and nonadherence associated with polypharmacy. 7,9-13 With compromised physiology due to aging, the elderly are most vulnerable to the adverse events of any drug interaction. On the other hand, addition of a dietary supplement to conventional cardiovascular drugs may confer benefit . Evidence of both benefits and harms of adding a supplement to cardiovascular drugs has been reported. 6,14 Incorporation in clinical practice of knowledge regarding the impact of concomitant use of cardiovascular medications and dietary supplements requires access to reliable drug -supplement information, as well as physicians' commitment to documenting patients' supplement use.15,16 While a substantial amount of research and data is available describing drug -drug interactions in various populations, the evidence for drug-supplement interactions or simply add-on supplement effect is unclear , especially in the CVD populations. Objectives The objective of this C omparative Effectiveness Review was to systematically synthesize and grade the strength of evi dence of benefit s and harms of adding a dietary supplement to cardiovascular drugs routinely prescribed in outpatient settings. A related objective included assessment of whether the altered outcomes of efficacy and/or effectiveness and harms are a result of a simple add -on effect of a dietary supplement or more complex interactions with the cardiovascular drug. Supplement-drug interactions were examined by investigating evidence of statistical and pharmacokinetic interactions. These objectives were framed in the following K ey Questions. ES-2 In adults taking cardiovascular drugs, what are the effects of concomitant use of specific dietary supplements (when compared with cardiovascular drugs alone or cardiovascular drugs and a different dietary supplement[s]) on: Key Q uestion 1. Clinical cardiovascular effectiveness/efficacy outcomes (e.g., mortality and specific cardiovascular or cerebrovascular conditions such as myocardial infarction and stroke)? (a) Do the effect estimates of clinical cardiovascular outcomes vary by age, ethnicity, gender, or health status? (b) Is there a measurable interaction between cardiovascular drugs and dietary supplements for clinical cardiovascular outcomes? Key Question 2. Intermediate cardiovascular efficacy outcomes (e.g., l ipids, blood pressure, electrocardiographic measurements, serum markers, bleeding, and coagulation times)? (a) Do the effect estimates of intermediate cardiovascular outcomes vary by age, ethnicity, gender, or health status?

Clinical or intermediate harms outcomes (e.g., organ toxicity, serious adverse events, withdrawal due to adverse events)? (a) Do the effect estimates of harms outcomes vary by age, ethnicity, gender, or health status? (b) Is there a measurable interaction between cardiovascular drugs and dietary supplements for harms outcomes? Key Question 4. Pharmacokinetic outcomes (e.g., half life [t 1/2], area under the concentration curve [AUC]) of cardiovascular drugs of interest? (a) Do the effect estimates of pharmacokinetic outcomes vary by age, ethnicity, gender, or health status? (b) Is there a measurable interaction between cardiovascular drugs and dietary supplements for pharmacokinetic outcomes? Analytic Framework The expectation s behind using a dietary supplement with prescription cardiovascular drugs are improvement in the disease process (or its prevention) and reduction in harms related to cardiovascular drugs. These effects might come about through either an add- on effect of a supplement or its biological interaction with a cardiovascular drug. Benefits and harms are measured as outcomes that may be clinical outcomes , their proxy surrogates, or pharmacokinetic parameters . The analytic framework in Figure A depicts the causal pat hways forming the basis of the Key Questions. ES-3 Figure A.

Methods Input From Stakeholders Preliminary broad searches identified the necessity to focus this review, so we formulated the population, intervention, comparator, and outcome (PICO) analytic framework and Key Questions in consultation with the Key Informants during a topic refinement stage. The range of dietary supplements w as narrowed to include only those most commonly taken along with cardiovascular drugs and for which there was no recent review. A fifth K ey Question, regarding P450 isozyme activity and cellular drug transport mechanisms, was dropped. The Key Informants included clinicians (cardiologists, naturopathic doctors, clinical pharmacology specialist, and nutritionist), a patient/consumer advocate, and systematic review research methodologists. The public w ere invited to provide comments on the K ey Questions. During the review process, we followed an a priori research protocol developed with the clinical and methodological input of a Technical Expert Panel (TEP) of specialist clinicians and methodologists. The protocol followed the Effective Health Care Program's Methods Guide for Effectiveness and Comparative Effectiveness Reviews . 17 ES-4 Data Sources and Searches We searched the following electronic databases from inception to September 1, 2011: MEDLINE\u00ae, Embase, the Cochrane Library (CENTRAL, CDSR, DARE, and HTA), International Bibliographic Information on Dietary Supplements (IBIDS), and Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED). We developed peer- reviewed search strategies (shown in Appendix A of the full report ) using a broad range of controlled vocabulary to address the various synonyms assoc iated with this topic, as well as to cover any evolutionary gaps associated with the introduction of certain vocabulary terms. We also searched trial registries (e.g., ClinicalTrials.gov, Current Controlled Trials, Clinical Study Results, World Health Organization Clinical Trials), the Cambridge Scientific Abstracts Conference Papers Index, and Scopus. Results were refined using filters for systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), non-RCTs and observational studies, and safety. A more speci fic strategy related solely to herb-drug interactions was run in the same databases using only a systematic review filter. We also contacted TEP members and the Scientific Resource Center at the Agency for Healthcare R esearch and Quality. Study Selection Two reviewers screened titles, abstracts, and full- text reports , with conflicts resolved by consensus or third- party adjudication. A primary study was eligible if it : Was published in English or German. Examined a dietary supplement . A dietary supplement was defined as a vitamin, a mineral, an herb or other botanical, an amino acid, a dietary substance, or a concentrate metabolite, constituent, or extract intended to increase the total dietary intake made for ingestion in pill, capsule, tablet, powd er, or liquid form not represented for use as conventional food or as the sole item of a meal or diet) . Compared the effect of adding a dietary supplement to cardiovascular medication(s) to the same cardiovascular medication(s) or to another dietary supplement ( from the list above) added to the same cardiovascular medication(s). Evaluated use of a dietary supplement intended for ingestion as pill, capsule, tablet, powder, or liquid. The dietary supplements considered were coenzyme Q10, Echinacea , garlic, ginger, Gin ginseng, hawthorn, oral magnesium more than 250 mg /day), omega-3 fatty acids/ fish oils, red yeast rice extract, resveratrol, vitamin A, vitamin D with or without calcium, vitamin E, and vitamin K. This list was selected after extensive discussions with the TEP and reference to surveys of the general and cardiovascular populations in the Unites States.7,18-23 Included cardiovascular drugs that were commonly used in outpatient settings ( Table 1 of full report). Reported clinical or surrogate cardiovascular efficacy or harms, or pharmacokinetic outcomes, in any adult population. Was a randomized controlled trial, nonrandomized trial, or observational study with an independent concurrent or historical control group including at least five participants. For Key Question 4, studies employing participants as their own controls were also eli gible. (This was a post hoc decision in light of the relevance of this design for study of pharmacokinetic interaction s.) ES-5 Good-quality English language systematic reviews on the topic were also eligible . However, a systematic review could replace de novo synthesis of evidence only when the review was deemed to be current , obviating the need to update it. Studies included after full- text screening were removed from data synthesis because of one or more of the following reasons: Cardiovascular drug(s) were not taken by at least 80 percent of participants in RCTs. Including such studies would have severely limited the applicability of evidence. The study reported effect estimates that did not reflect a comparison of supplement plus drug(s) versus drug(s) alon e (or plus another supplement). No relevant outcome was reported in the study or the outcome data were not received from the authors of the studies. (A uthors were contacted for data clarification and additional outcome data when data were recognized to have been recorded but not reported in the published study\u2014for example, outcome data without a measure of dispersion.) The design of the study was lower in the hierarchy of evidence (i.e., nonrandomized experimental or observational study in the presence of h igher quality RCT evidence ) and did not meaningfully add to the evidence already included by being a longer term or pragmatic stu dy reporting conclusive results. Studies included cardiovascular drugs not marketed in the U nited States. Administration dose and/or frequency of the dietary supplement was not quantified. Data Extraction and Risk- of-Bias Assessment One reviewer extracted relevant data from each study and a second reviewer independently verified data for a 10 percent random sample of studies . Extraction items included general study characteristics (e.g., year of publication, study design); population characteristics (e.g., inclusion/exclusion criteria, age, race, level of activity , condition); intervention characteristics (e.g., dose, duration, details about comparators, level of care); and outcomes (i.e., clinical and surrogate outcomes of efficacy and harms, and pharmacokinetic outcomes) with their estimates. During the data extraction process, one reviewer with a clinical background rated study populations' 10- year coronary heart disease (CHD) risk according to the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP ATP III) guidelines. 24 We assessed study risk of bias according to outcome, using generic items for confounding and various types of bias (e.g., selection, performance, detection, and attrition bias ) separately for each study design. Selected items from the McMaster Quality Assessment Scale of Harms were also incorporated into the risk -of-bias assessment for harm -related outcomes . Certain criteria were specific to particular study designs; for example, allocation generation and concealment applied only to RCTs. 25 For gradable outcomes, one reviewer rated the overall risk of bias for the study as low, moderate, or high risk, and a second reviewer independently verified the assessment. Outcomes were rated as high risk of bias if there was an apparent and major flaw in the study that would invalidate results. Appendix C in the full report provides the detailed individual study data and risk-of- bias ratings. ES-6 Grading the Strength of the Body of Evidence and Applicability In principle, a body of evidence originating in randomized trials starts with a presumed high strength of evidence and is downgraded across the domains when there is important overall risk of bias for contributing studies, inconsistency in the direction of the intervention effect, indirectness of the outcome of interest (e.g., a surrogate outcome rather than a clinical health outcome), or imprecision in effect estimates of an extent that neither important benefit nor harm can be ruled out. For nonrandomized studies, the body of evidence starts with a presumed low strength of evidence but may be upgraded across certain domains. The strength of a body of evidence was graded based on the following four domains, per published guidance: overall risk of bias by outcome, consistency, directness, and precision.26 Gradable important outcomes for this review were identified a priori in consultation with the TEP (Table A). This was done because customarily only a subset of important outcomes that are more meaningful for decisionmaking concerning each specific Key Question are chosen .26 A methodologist and a content expert graded the strength of the body of evidence as \"high,\" \"moderate,\" \" low,\" or \"insufficient.\" From a larger list of outcomes of interest for each K ey Question (see the Methods section of the full report ).26,27 Table A. A priori outcomes for grading the strength of evidence Key Question Outcomes 1 Mortality (all -cause and vascular death) syndromes) ; cerebrovascular events (hemorrhagic/ischemic/unspecified stroke) ; quality of life ; hospitalization ; arrhythmia ; and clinical outcomes of peripheral arterial disease 2 Blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) ; lipid lipoprotein, and non-high -density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides) ; international normalized ratio for coumarin derivatives ; incidence of metabolic syndrome ; and change in 10 -year Framingham risk profile 3 Serious adverse events (composite outcome according to the Food and Drug Administration definition of serious adverse events );27 withdrawal due to adverse events ; clinical bleeding (intracranial, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, subretinal, etc.) ; renal dysfunction (e.g., proteinuria, elevated creatinine, need for transplant, glomerular filtration rate) ; hepatotoxicity (elevated enzymes or fulminant failure) ; and QT prolongation 4 Area under the plasma cardiovascular drug concentration-time curve (AUC), maximum drug concentration (C max), drug half -life (t1/2), and oral clearance The strength of evidence was graded insufficient when there was no evidence for an outcome, when the direction of the estimates w as inconsistent between studies without an identifiable cause, or when the body of evidence from the contributing study/studies was underpowered for the outcome of interest (imprecise estimate). W hen an effect estimate was associated with a confidence interval (CI) that was not only nonsignificant, but wide enough that the clinical action would differ if the upper versus the lower boundary of the CI represented the truth, we rated the effect as imprecise. This reflected our uncertainty regarding clinically important benefit or harm, or a clinically unimportant difference in effect estimates between the contrasting interventions. Following published guidance, we summarized the determinants of applicability of the body of evidence for outcomes with conclusive results.28 Studies that evaluated representative patient populations in usual or routine care conditions and lasting long enough to meaningfully measure health outcomes of both benefits and harms were considered pragmatic or effectiveness studies. In contrast, studi es examining intermediate efficacy outcomes in highly selected patients were considered efficacy studies.29 ES-7 Data Synthesis and Analysis All analyses compared the combination of dietary supplement plus cardiovascular drug with cardiovascular drug alone or plus placebo or plus another dietary supplement. Meta- analyses were carried out when there was clinical and methodological homogeneity. For pharmacokinetic outcomes, we followed the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance for analysis and interpretation of drug interaction studies\u2014that is , the zone of bioequivalence is recommended to be between the lower and upper bound of the 90 percent geometric mean ratio (GMR) , with a CI between 0.8 and 1.25. 30 We did not pool experimental and observational studies, but did pool parallel studies with valid crossover randomized trials. We did not consider precrossover data for synthesis except when it was judged that the treatment given to participants in a given crossover trial was not appropriate for the condition under consideration. 31,32 Similarly, we did not pool crossover trials that had not employed a sufficient washout period between the two treatment periods because of bias arising from carryover treatment effe cts. We did not meta -analyze observational studies because of the differences in adjustment for confounders and residual confounding. Meta-analysis was considered when studies were randomized trials that included similar populations, compared the same type of dietary supplement versus comparator treatment, and reported the same outcome measures in the same statistical format ( e.g., mean difference or GMR). Relative risk (RR) and post-treatment mean differences (MDs) were meta- analyzed using the DerSimonian and Laird random- effects model , 33 and Peto odds ratios were calculated when event rates were less than1 percent.32 For studies with zero events in some arms or sparse data overall, we pooled using the fixed- effects Mantel -Haenszel method without continuity correction.34 Studies with zero events in both arms were excluded from meta- analysis.32 Where applicable, we examined statistical heterogeneity by calculating the synergy index (detailed in the Methods section of the full report).35 The synergy index estimates the supplement- drug statistical interaction when the effect observed with the combination is of a magnitude that is greater than or less than would be anticipated in an additive model, knowing the independent effects of the supplement and drug. An S-index (ratio of effects measured to additive calculation) greater than 1 describes a positive interaction (synergism) , and an S-index less than 1 indicates a negative interaction (antagonism). Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using Cochran's Q ( = 0.10) and the I 2 statistic. Outcome results were considered to be inconclusive when the pooled estim ate or the single contributing study estimate had confidence intervals wide enough to incorporate both clinically important benefit and harm (i.e., type II error suggesting underpowered studies unable to precisely conclude benefit, harm , or no difference between treatments). Results were also considered to be inconclusive when studies could not be pooled\u2014for example , when similar outcomes were reported in different statistical formats in studies or study results pointed in opposite directions. When inconclusive results were associated with a gradable outcome, strength of evidence was deemed insufficient.

Note: Evidence was \"insufficient\" for all outcomes, so applicability is not presented . Abbreviations: ACE = angiotensin -converting enzyme; QID = 4 times daily (every 6 hours); TIA = transient ischemic attack ; TID = 3 times daily . ES-10 Twenty-one randomized controlled trials contributed evidence for Key Q uestion 1.36-56 No data were available from observational studies. Generally, across all combinations of dietary supplements and cardiovascular drugs, the strength of evidence of the gradable outcomes of comparative efficacy or effectiveness was graded insufficient . Type II error cou ld not be excluded due to the low statistical power of mostly short- term efficacy trials . In addition, strict inclusion criteria exclud ed patients with uncontrolled comorbidities and acute ischemic events. Coenzyme Q10 . Insufficient evidence was found for the effect of coenzyme Q10 co administered with angiotensin -converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on all- cause mortality and quality of life in 30 mostly male patients with left ventricular dysfunction over a 3-month period. 54 Adherence to simvastatin with or without supplement co administration was 98 percent during a 12 -week pilot study in 22 patients with previous statin -related myalgia.38 Ginkgo biloba. With no deaths observed, insufficient evidence for mortality was found for G. biloba coadministered with aspirin and/or pentoxyphilline during a 4-week underpowered study in 33 South Asians with previous ischemic stroke. 48 Magnesium . In a crossover trial of oral magnesium aspartate or placebo administered daily for 8 weeks to a selected group of 40 hypertensive patients with no comorbidities on therapeutic doses of beta-blockers, a single event of myocardial infarction was noted . 42 Omega -3 fatty acids. Insufficient evidence from underpowered efficacy studies addressed the outcomes of mort ality (in 50 healthy men) 36 and arrhythmia (in 122 highly selected dyslipidemic patients)40 when omega- 3 fatty acids were co administered with statins. In three short- term efficacy trials of omega -3 fatty acid and statin co administration , statin adherence as judged by pill count was found to be greater than 95 percent in both treatment groups.37,44,53 Insufficient evidence from single efficacy trials did not demonstrate a difference in the outcome of all- cause mortality when study cardiovascular drugs wer e aspirin (291 high- risk patients followed for 1 year with 9 deaths), warfarin (319 high-risk patients followed for 1 year with 5 deaths), and fenofibrate (unclear 10-year CHD risk in 167 participants with hypertriglyceridemia followed for 8 weeks with no deaths). 47,56 Insufficient evidence addressed the outcome of acute myocardial infarction in a 6 -month efficacy study of omega-3 fatty acids in addition to therapeutic doses of aspirin plus calcium channel antagonist following successful coronary angioplasty in 58 participants .51 Vitamin E . Insufficient evidence with sparse events of stroke and transient ischemic attack was provided by an efficacy trial of vitamin E plus aspirin versus aspirin alone in 100 highly selected patients with previous neurologic deficit. 49 Vitamin K . Insufficient evidence was found for m ortality and stroke. In one 6-month efficacy trial in 70 selected groups of patients with unstable international normalized ratios (INRs) anticoagulated with warfarin with coadministered vitamin K , no stroke and 1 death were observed. 41 Other supplement -cardiovascular drug combinations and outcomes . Three notable trials reported outcomes that were not a priori gradable outcome s. ES-11 One pragmatic trial in 19,934 women randomized to vitamin E plus aspirin versus aspirin alone for 10 years noted no significant differences for the composite outcome of nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and vascular death (RR, 0.95; 95 percent CI, 0.79 to 1.13).39 Although components of the composite outcome were gradable, it was not possible to discern if shifts in the incidence of stroke and heart attack might have been obscured in this composite outcome. Inconsistent evidence on rates of restenosis following successful coronary angioplasty, best explained by differences in study population, design, and treatment, was found with omega-3 fatty acids added to conventional antiplatelet therapy and calcium channel an tagonists.51,52 When 82 highly selected male patients took omega -3 fatty acids daily along with therapeutic doses of aspirin, dipyridamole, and calcium channel antagonists, significantly lower rates of restenosis (at least 50 percent reduction in diameter) were observed compared with the cardiovascular drug s alone (RR , 0.40; 95 percent CI , 0.20 to 0.82); however, the mean percentage reduction in luminal diameter was not significantly different between the two groups.52 No differences were noted in rates of restenosis when a similar but lower quality trial was conducted in 107 South Asians in India who were not taking dipyridamole.51 Underpowered studies addressed other outcomes that were not graded per the a priori protocol. These included exacerbation of congestive heart failure, number of patients undergoing cardiac procedures, graft occlusion, neurologic recovery score, coronary vasospasm, and number of angina attacks for various dietary supplement and cardiovascular drug combinations. Most studies were short- term efficacy trials. No data were identified for hospitalization or peripheral arterial disease for any supplement- cardiovascular drug(s) combination. No evidence on outcomes of clinical efficacy/effectiveness was found for Echinacea , garlic, ginger, ginseng, hawthorn, supplemental doses of niacin (not more than 250 mg /day), red yeast rice extract, resveratrol, vitamin A, or vitamin D (with or without calcium) supplementation coadministered with a cardiovascular drug. Key Question 1a . Do the effect estimates of clinical cardiovascular outcomes vary by ag e, ethnicity, gender, or health status? A paucity of studies of supplement-drug combinations for which data were available precluded exploration of heterogeneity in terms of preidentified subgroups or document ation of any dose- response effect. Key Question 1b. Is there a measurable interaction between cardiovascular drugs and dietary supplements for clinical cardiovascular outcomes? No study analyzed statistical interaction s between a supplement and a cardiovascular drug in terms of clinical outcomes. Key Question 2. Intermediate cardiovascular efficacy outcomes of cardiovascular drug(s) plus supplement versus drug (s) plus placebo, no supplement, or another supplement Evidence for Key Question 2 is shown in Table D.

No relevant observational study was identified. Study participants in most studies had mixed (low and/or moderate) or unclear CHD risk (27.1 percent and 37.3 percent, respectively). Study quality was variable. In the majority of RCTs, the generation of allocation sequence (78 percen t) and allocation concealment (93 percent) were unclear. In about 20 percent of studies, participants, health care providers, or outcome assessors were blinded to treatment allocation. This information was not clear for 56 percent of the studies. The major ity of evidence on intermediate outcomes was contributed by small underpowered RCTs whose statistically nonsignificant results with wide confidence intervals could rule out neither important benefits nor harms . Due to this imprecision, the strength of evidence for several gradable outcomes was rated insufficient (inconclusive results). When a significant effect was observed , we graded the strength of evidence to be low because of limitations in the internal validity of studies, surrogacy of outcomes, and generally poor to absent reproducibility among ES-15 studies in the direction of effect estimates (Table D). None of the studies reported outcomes evaluating incidence of metabolic syndrome, incidence of hypotension, carotid- intima media thickness, or change in 10- year Framingham risk profile. Coenzyme Q10 . Evidence was available from four RCTs with unclear CHD risk (49 Asians ith hypercholesterolemia57), mixed CHD risk (44 participants with statin -induced myalgia38), and high CHD risk (40 participants with diabetes and dyslipidemia58 and 30 participants with ischemic or idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy54). Overall, no significant differences (grade: insufficient; results inconclusive) were seen between the combination of coenzyme Q10 plus a cardiovascular drug versus drug alone in post- treatment levels of : (SBP) (fenofibrates ). Lowgrade evidence was avaiable from one trial indicating no significant difference in high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (H DL-C) for the combination of coenzyme Q10 plus fenofibrate versus fenofibrates alone. Echinacea . In one small study in 12 healthy male participants (low CHD risk) , 59 post-treatment levels of INR and platelet aggregation were not significant ly different in the combination of Echinacea plus warfarin than with warfarin alone. The results were inconclusive. Garlic . Four studies examined the effects of garlic in combination with warfarin (48 participants with unclear CHD risk 60 and 16 male s with low CHD risk61), nitrates (60 participants with high CHD risk62), and statins plus aspirin (19 participants with high CHD ri sk63). The effect of garlic plus warfarin versus warfarin alone on post- treatment lipid profile, blood pressure, INR, platelet aggregability, and platelet count was not significant (inconclusive; grade: insufficient)60,61 except for significant improvement of HDL -C levels for garlic plus warfarin versus warfarin alone (grade: low).60 In participants with coronary artery disease (high CHD risk), the combination of garlic plus nitrates62 significantly improved total cholesterol (MD, 28.20 mg/dL [95 percent CI, 48.30 to 8.10]) and HDL- but not triglyceride (MD, mg /dL [95 percent CI , 27.60 to 7.00]). The effects of garlic combined with statins plus aspirin63 on lipid profile, C- reactive protein , platelet count, and Agaston calcium score w ere not significantly different from those of statins plus aspirin in participants with coronary artery disease (Framingham risk >20 percent). Ginger . In one trial of 12 healthy male participants t here was no significant difference in post- treatment INR (inconclusive; grade: insufficient) or platelet aggregability between participants taking the combination of ginger plus warfarin versus warfarin alone . 64 Ginkgo biloba. Five RCTs investigated this in with (acetylsalicylic acid, 65,66 For G. biloba plus antiplatelet agents (104 participants in total, mixed CHD risk) ,65,66 the differences in clotting time, partial thromboplastin time, platelet count, lipid parameters, and blood pressure were not significant (results for lipids and blood pres sure inconclusive; grade: insufficient). The pooled results of two trials (24 participants with mixed CHD risk ,68 10 participants with low CHD risk67) indicated no significant differences in platelet aggregation and bleeding time between the G.biloba plus antiplatelet combination versus antiplatelet-only groups. Similarly , G. biloba (200 mg of G. biloba leaf, 9.6 mg of ginkgo flavonglycosides, 2.4 mg of ginkgolides and bilobalide three times/day) plus warfarin did not result in significantly different post-treatment levels of platelet aggregability or INR (result for INR inconclusive; grade: aggregability 34.08]) and bleeding time ( MD, 1.02 minutes [95 percent CI , 0.10 to 1.94]) were significantly better in the G. biloba plus cilostazol combination group than the cilostazol-only group. Ginseng . Three RCTs investigated various ginseng products in combination with warfarin. 69-71 The results from these studies for INR were conflicting (inconclusive; grade: insufficient). Two trials showed no significant difference (25 participants with high CHD risk , 69 12 males with low CHD risk71). One trial (20 participants with l ow CHD risk70) showed a significant difference , with lower peak INR and AUC of INR in the combination versus control group (MD , -0.19 [95 percent CI, -0.36 to -1.00 between the ginseng -warfarin combination and warfarin- only groups were not significant (results were inconclusive). Hawthorn. One small trial72 found no significant difference in an ECG measure (PR interval , which is measured from the beginning of the P wave to the beginning of the QRS complex) between participants receiving hawthorn plus digoxin and those receiving digoxin alone (results inconclusive) in 11 adults at low risk for CHD. Magnesium . Three RCTs investigated oral magnesium in combination with hydrochlorothiazide73,74 or beta-adrenergic antagonists42 in participants with hypertension. In two trials, SBP and DBP ( diastolic blood pressure) did not differ significantly between the magnesium hydrochlorothiazide combination versus hydrochlorothiazide-alone groups in the study with 18 participants with unclear CHD risk73 or the study with 21 participants with low/moderate CHD risk74 (inconclusive; grade: insufficient). Similarly, in another study,42 neither SBP nor DBP w as significantly different in 39 participants receiving the co mbination of magnesium plus beta-adrenergic antagonists versus those receiving beta-a drenergic antagonists alone. In one trial,73 post-treatment total cholesterol and triglyceride levels were not significantly different between the magnesium -hydrochlorothiazide combination versus hydrochlorothiazide- alone groups (inconclusive; grade: insufficient). Niac in (no more than 250 mg /day). One RCT in 28 participants with hyperlipoproteinemia (unclear CHD risk )75 investigated niacin in combination with propranolol. Post- treatment levels of triglycerides and total cholesterol were not significantly different between th e group receiving niacin plus propranolol and the groups receiving propranolol alone (inconclusive; grade: ES-17 insufficient). This study was judged to be at high risk of bias because groups were administered different dosages of propranolol (20 mg and 60 mg ). Omega -3 fatty acids. Twenty -four RCTs investigated the use of omega -3 fatty acids plus cardiovascular drugs (statins, ACE inhibitors, calcium channel blockers alone or with other cardiovascular drugs, fenofibr ates, niacin plus aspirin, aspirin, beta-block ers, or an anticoagulation agent) versus cardiovascular drugs alone. The effect on post-treatment triglyceride (TG) levels of adding the supplement to statins was modified according to baseline levels of triglycerides. Specifically, in participants with higher mean baseline levels of TG (greater than 200 mg/dL) there was a statistically significant pooled mean reduction in post- treatment TG levels in the combination arm (two trials, grade: low). 40,76 In contrast, the meta-analysis of four studies with participants with lower levels of TG at baseline (under 200 mg /dL) showed no significant difference between the groups (grade: insufficient). Pooled analyses for levels of HDL -C (seven trials), LDL -C (six trials), and total cholesterol ( six trials) showed no significant differences (grade: low) in participants with mixed or unclear CHD risk. The mean SBP was significantly lowered in the supplement-statin combination group (grade: low) in 22 participants with hyperlipemia. Evidence was inconclusive for the out comes of total cholesterol/HDL -C ratio, non- HDL-C, lipoprotein A, diastolic blood pressure, and bleeding time. Additionally , for nongradable outcomes such as C-reactive protein and blood coagulation parameters ( prothrombin partial thromboplastin time [aPTT], platelet aggregation) , there were no significant differences between combination and control groups. Trials of 43 elderly males undergoing angioplasty using omega- 3 fatty acids -statins combinations reported post- levels of non-HDL-C, total cholesterol/HDL -C ratio, and platelet count that were conflicting (opposite direction of effect estimates) and thus inconclusive (grade: insufficient). In trials using omega-3 fatty acids -ACE inhibitors combination treatment, there were no changes in blood pressure (no difference; grade: low), but significantly more participants experienced at least 50 percent reduction in proteinuria in favor of the combination treatment (RR, 4.00 [95 percent CI , 1.40 to 11.30] ). 77 In one trial using omega -3 fatty acids -fenofibrate combination treatment in participants with high triglyceride levels,56 the incidence of hypertension was not significantly different in the combination versus control group (RR, 0.98 [95 percent CI , 0.14 to 6.85]). In using omega- 3 fatty acids -calcium channel blockers combinations, there was no significant difference between the combination and control groups in post- treatment lipid profile (inconclusive; gr ade: insufficient) . Two other trials using aspirin in addition to calcium channel blockers found significant differences in triglycerides (grade: low) in favor of the combination treatment .51,52 These trials were not pooled because dipyridamole was an additional drug in one trial and not in another. In one underpowered trial (1 4 participants with atherogenic dyslipidemia , unclear CHD risk78), post-treatment lipid profile did not differ significantly between the combination of omega-3 fatty acids plus niacin and aspirin versus niacin and aspirin (inconclusive; grade: insufficient). In one trial (11 participants with unclear CHD risk) , treatment with 3 or 6 g/day omega-3 fatty acids plus warfarin versus warfarin resulted in no significant difference in post-treatment INR values between groups (no numeric data provided). ES-18 Vitamin E . Ten RCTs and one controlled clinical trial79 examined the use of vitamin E with antiplatelet agents (aspirin or ticlopidine) ,80 post-treatment total cholesterol and triglyceride levels were not significantly different between the groups receiving v itamin E-antiplatelet agent (aspirin or ticlopidine ) combination versus aspirin alone in with carotid atherosclerosis (inconclusive; grade: insufficient). Platelet aggregation was significantly decreased with vitamin E supplementation plus aspirin compared with aspirin alone ( MD, -1.70 per cm2 [95 percent CI, - 2.06 to -1.34]).49 The effect of vitamin E -furosemide combination on blood pressure was not significantly different from that of furosemide alone in 24 participants with essential hypertension (inconclusive; grade: insufficient).81 The vitamin E -nifedipine combination significantly lowered total cholesterol (MD , -35.96 mg HDL-C (inconclusive, grade: insufficient) or SBP (inconclusive, grade: insufficient) in 30 elderly subjects at high risk of CHD.82 There was no significant difference in lipid profile across trials using vitamin E -gemfibrozil or vitamin E-statins combinations when compared with the cardiovascular drug alone (inconclusive; grade: insufficient). (See pooled analyses for HDL -C, LDL-C, total cholesterol, and triglycerides.) Likewise, there was no significant difference in blood pressure (inconclusive; grade: insufficient) for v itamin E-gemfibrozil combination, and no significant difference in C- reactive protein, prothrombin time, and platelet count for vitamin E -statins combinations compared with cardiovascular drug(s) alone. Vitamin K . In one trial,41 percentage of time INR was in therapeutic range was improved in the group receiving vitamin K -coumarin derivative (warfarin) combination compared with warfarin alone. In addition, number of participants achieving stable INR was higher in combination than with warfarin alone. Overall evidence indicates that supplementation with vitamin K may improve the stability of anticoagulant therapy (grade: low) . Other supplements . No evidence was identified for effects of red yeast rice extract, resveratrol, vitamin A, or vitamin D in combination with cardiovascular drugs on intermediate outcomes. Key Question 2a. Do the effect estimates of intermediate cardiovascular outcomes vary by age, ethnicity, gender, or health status? Sparse evidence precl uded exploration of heterogeneity in the effect estimates for harms across preidentified subgroups. Key Question 2b . Is there a measurable interaction between cardiovascular drugs and dietary supplements for intermediate cardiovascular efficacy outcomes? Two studies contributed to the evidence regarding statistical interaction between cardiovascular drugs and dietary supplements for this section.44,78 One study assessed statistical interaction using general linear modeling .44 No significant interactions were observed between the combination of omega- 3 fatty acids and statins with regard to changes in lipid profile (HDL-ES-19 C, LDL-C, total cholesterol, triglycerides, non- HDL-C) in 52 obese men with dyslipidemia and insulin resistance (moderate/moderately high risk for CHD).44 Authors of another trial78 conducted a formal assess ment of statistical interaction using ANOVA (analysis of variance) and found that the decrease in triglyceride levels resulting from the combination of omega- 3 fatty acids plus niacin was more than twice the additive effect of either therap y alone in 29 participants with atherogenic dyslipidemia (unclear CHD risk). Key Question 3. Clinical or intermediate harms with cardiovascular drug(s) plus supplement versus drug(s) plus placebo, no supplement, or another supplement Evidence for Ke y Question 3 is shown in Table E. Table E. Evidence for the gradable harms outcomes \u2014Key Question 3 Outcome Measure Dietary Supplement + CV Drug(s) Insufficient strength of evidence Conclusion: Inconclusive (type II error or inconsistent direction of estimates) Serious adverse events Coenzyme Q10 (3-4 g/day) + Statins (2 g/day) + Warfarin ; Omega-3 (4 g/day ) + ASA + D ipyridamole + C alcium channel blockers ; Omega -3 fatty acids (4 g/day ) + Fenofibrate; Omega -3 fatty acids (3 or 6 g/day ) + Warfarin Vitamin E (400 IU/day) + ASA; Vitamin E (1350 IU/day) + Nifedipine Bleeding (major, minor, and undefined) Garlic (10 mL/day ) + Warfarin Ginkgo biloba Omega-3 (4 g/day ) + ASA + D ipyridamole + C alcium channel blockers ; Omega -3 fatty acids (mean 3 g/day ) + ASA + C lopidogrel ; Omega-3 fatty acids (3 or 6 g/day ) + Warfarin Vitamin E (400 IU/day) + ASA Vitamin K (5 mg/day) + Warfarin Renal dysfunction (abnormal glomerular filtration rate, urea nitrogen, serum potassium) Vitamin E (400 IU/day) + Statins ; Vitamin E (1350 IU/day) + QT interval Vitamin E ACE = angiotensin -converting enzyme; ASA acetylsalicylic a cid (aspirin) ; CV = cardiovascular. ES-20 A total of 58 studies contributed evidence for Key Question 3. One included study was a retrospective cohort study examining omega- 3 fatty acids and antiplatelet agents ; it had important limitations in design and reporting, as it was unclear regarding participant selection, confounding, and blinding of outcome assessors.88 The rest of the studies were RCTs, mostly of moderate risk of bias for the gradable outcomes of harms (serious adverse events, withdrawal due to adverse events, renal dysfunction, hepatotoxicity, QT interval, and bleeding). Most of these studies recruited a small number of participants and were underpowered for the outcomes of harm. Meta-analyses were possible for some omega-3 fatty acids studies . Other evidence could not be pooled because either there was a single study per outcome or zero events in both treatment arms. For all combinations of dietary supplement and cardiovascular drug, the strength of evidence for all gradable outcomes was insufficient due to inconsistent effect estimates across studies suggesting conflicting findings with no obvious explanation or statistically nonsignificant estimates with wide c onfidence intervals (Table E). Most crossover trials incorporated an adequate washout period, so carryover effect was not a major concern. Coenzyme Q10 . Five short-term (up to 12 weeks duration) small RCTs that included participants with mixed (moderate and high risk) /unclear 38,57,89 or high 54,58 CHD risk examined coenzyme Q10 plus statins, fenofibrate, ACE inhibitors, or, in one study, vitamin E added to statins. No statistically significant differences were observed for total adverse events,54,57 abnormalities in fasting blood glucose,57,58 However, the studies were underpowered to detect differences in these harms. One RCT of 32 participants with statin -induced myopathic symptoms89 found a significantly greater number of subjects with reduced myopathic pain (RR, 4.18 [95 percent CI , 1.50 to 11.46]) and lower pain severity scores on the Brief Pain Inventory (MD, -1.76 [95 percent CI , - 2.93 to -0.58]) and interference score (MD, -1.43 [95 percent CI , -2.76 to -0.10]) in group (coenzyme Q10 100 mg /day plus statins) versus vitamin E (400 IU/day) plus statin group. A small pilot RCT of 44 participants with self- reported myalgia unable to take adequate doses of statins38 did not find a significant difference in myalgia, using a visual analog scale, or in number of participants tolerating simvastatin (RR , 1.23 [95 -alone groups. Echinacea One small RCT of 12 healthy volunteers examined Echinacea plus a single dose of warfarin versus warfarin alone. No withdrawals due to adverse events or other adverse events were observed. 59 Garlic . Four small short- term RCTs examined garlic in combination with warfarin, nitrates, or statins plus aspirin in healthy males 61 or those with cardiovascular conditions.60,62,63 No significant between -group differences were observed across gradable and nongradable outcomes such as fasting blood glucose,60,62,63 anemia,60 and leukopenia.63 Wide confidence intervals for differences in bleeding and fasting blood glucose precluded drawing any meaningful conclusions. ES-21 Ginkgo biloba. Seven small RCTs examined nitrates, cilostazol clopidogrel, or ticlopidine.48,64-68,90 The subjects either were healthy volunteers,64,65,67,68,90 had experienced acute ischemic stroke,48 or had peripheral arterial disease.66 Two of these studies included only a single dose of cilostazol/clopidogrel67 or ticlopidine ,68 so their results should be interpreted with caution. Across all cardiovascular medications, nonsignificant results were observed for gradable outcomes (i.e., withdrawal due to adverse events, bleeding, renal dysfunction, hepatotoxicity, and serious adverse events). Nonsignificant results were also found for all other harms, such as total adverse events, 66,67,90 upset stomach,66 anemia,65,66 studies were underpowered to detect any differences in harms outcomes. Ginseng . Three RCTs examined the effects of Panax ginseng , American ginseng,70 and Korean ginseng71 plus warfarin versus warfarin alone. No statistically significant effects were observed in gradable outcomes (i.e., withdrawal due to adverse events, bleeding, renal dysfunction, and hepatotoxicity) or nongradable outcomes such as prothrombin time, total adverse events, headache, dizziness, indigestion, INR above 3.5, diarrhea, constipation, hematocrit, and anemia. 69 These trials were all small and underpowered. Hawthorn. One RCT examined hawthorn plus digoxin versus digoxin alone in eight healthy volunteers. 72 No statistically significant differences were observed in incidence of flatulence, nausea, insomnia, headache, and dizziness. Magnesium . Two small RCTs in hypertensive subjects examined the effects of magnesium plus hydrochlorothiazide or beta -adrenergic antagonists. 42,73 No statistically significant differences were observed for withdrawal due to adverse events,42,73 renal dysfunction,42,73 serious adverse events,42 abnormal ECG.73 Niacin (not more than 250 mg /day). One RCT of 20 subjects with hyperlipoproteinemia investigated the effects of niacin plus propranolol versus propranolol alone. 75 No statistically significant differences were found in nausea and flushing or in hypotension. This study was at high risk of bias because groups received different dosages of propranolol (20 mg in combination group and 60 mg in monotherapy group). Omega -3 fatty acids. Twenty -two studies (21 RCTs and 1 retrospective cohort study) examined omega-3 fatty acids plus s tatins, 36,37,40,53,91 -97 aspirin,47,52,78,98,99,99 aspirin and clopidogrel,88 aspirin calcium channel blockers,52 warfarin,47,55 ramipril and/or irbesartan,77 or fenofibrate .56 These studies were generally small and underpowered. They recruited healthy subjects , or subjects with CHD or risk factors for CHD. For omega- 3 fatty acids plus statins versus statins alone, meta -analyses yielded nonsignificant estimates for serious adverse events, withdrawal due to adverse events, elevated aspartate aminotransferase ( AST) and alanine aminotransferase ( ALT), total adve rse events, dyspepsia, headache, infection, and elevated creatine kinase (CK)/creatine phosphokinase ( CPK). However, a glucose in ES-22 the omega-3 fatty acids plus statin group was observed in one RCT.40 For omega- 3 fatty acid s in combination with other cardiovascular drugs, no significant differences were found in harms outcomes. Vitamin E . Ten RCTs examined vitamin E plus aspirin,39,49,100 nifedipine,82 furosemide,81 or statins.46,83,84,86,87 No statistically significant differences were observed for total adverse events,100 incidence of headache,100 gastrointestinal discomfort,100 incidence glycosylated hemoglobin,87 leukopenia,46 or anemia.46 These studies recruited subjects who were h ealthy, or who had CHD or risk factors for CHD. Sample sizes were generally small, except for one study that recruited over 9,000 women.39 Vitamin K . One RCT of 6 months duration examined the effects of vitamin K plus warfarin versus warfarin alone.41 No significant differences were found for bleeding41 or withdrawal due to adverse events.41 This study recruited 70 participants with indications for anticoagulant therapy. Other supplements . No evidence on clinical harms was identified for the effects of ginger, red yeast rice extract, r esveratrol, vitamin A, or vitamin D in combination with cardiovascular drugs. Key Question 3a. Do the effect estimates of clinical or intermediate harms vary by age, ethnicity, gender, or health status? Sparse evidence precluded exploration of heterogeneity in the effect estimates for harms across preidentified subgroups. Key Question 3b. Is there a measurable interaction between cardiovascular drugs and dietary supplements for harms outcomes? One RCT presented data that would allow examination of the interaction between vitamin E supplements and the cardiovascular medication aspirin. This RCT found no significant difference in the rates of adverse events (headache, gastrointestinal discomfort, and withdrawal due to adverse events) among treatment regimes.100 Key Question 4. Pharmacokinetic outcomes with cardiovascular drug(s) plus supplement versus drug(s) plus placebo, no supplement, or another supplement Evidence for Key Question 4 is shown in Table F. ES-23 Table F.

Twelve randomized controlled trials contributed evidence on pharmacokinetic outcomes.36,59,61,64,68,70 -72,90,93,95,101 No data were available from observational studies. Generally, these studies were open -label crossover RCTs of moderate risk of bias for the gradable outcomes, including between 8 and 50 healthy volunteers. Six studies investigated cardiovascular drug kinetics following a single dose.59,61,64,68,71,90 The clinical significance of the interaction was evaluated using the FDA guidance.30 According to this guidance, the statistical significance of interactions alone cannot determine the clinical significance of interactions . Interactions are deemed significant when the 90 percent confidence intervals of the geometric mean ratio (GMR) fall clearly outside of the default no -effect range of 0.80 to 1.25. It must be noted that the evidence of pharmacokinetic interactions may not translate into altered clinica l effectiveness or harms. Also, evidence originating in healthy young adults may ES-24 not be applicable to older CVD patients taking cardiovascular drugs due to possible differences in abilities to absorb, metabolize , and excrete drugs. Echinacea . Evidence of low strength demonstrated no clinically significant interactions between a mixture of 600 mg of Echinacea angustifolia root plus 675 mg of E. purpurea root given four times a day for a period of 2 weeks and a single dose of 25 mg warfarin. The 90 percent upper and lower bound of GMR for the individual warfarin pharmacokinetic parameters were within the 0.80 to 1.25 boundaries of bioequivalence (Table F ). 59 Garlic . Interactions of 7 .4 mg/day of allicin pretreatment for 2 weeks with a single dose of 25 mg warfarin are unclear . Low-strength evidence suggested no clinically relevant interactions for some pharmacokinetic outcomes , while for other important outcomes the strength of eviden ce was graded as insufficient. 61 Evidence from one garlic -statin trial demonstrated insufficient evidence for pharmacokinetic interactions between the supplement (3600 \u00b5g of allicin twice daily) and 20 mg single doses of both simvastatin and pravastatin.101 Interactions and bioequivale nce could not be clearly established . Ginger . Evidence of low strength demonstrated no clinically significant interactions between 7 - day pretreatment with ginger and a single 25 mg dose of warfarin.64 Ginkgo biloba. Evidence of low strength demonstrated no clinically significant interactions between 7 -day pretreatm ent with G. biloba and a single 25 mg dose of warfarin. 64 Low-strength evidence revealed no clinically significant interactions between single doses of G. biloba and ticlopidine.68 Insufficient evidence addressed interactions between 7 -day pretreatment with G. biloba and single doses of digoxin. While pharmacokinetic outcomes showed statistically nonsignificant changes , data were not reported as GMRs , so meaningful conclusions could not be drawn. 90 Ginseng . Panax ginseng ( Korean ginseng) co administe red with warfarin demonstrated no clinically significant interactions based on evidence of low strength. 71 In contrast, interactions of American ginseng ( P. quinquefolius 2 g/day from weeks 2 to 4) with warfarin were unclear. Low-strength evidence suggested no clinically relevant interactions for some pharmacokinetic outcomes, while for other important outcomes the strength of evidence was graded as insufficient. 70 Hawthorn. In a trial of hawthorne (84.3 mg/day of oligomeric procyanidines) added to digoxin for 21 days versus digoxin alone for 10 days, no significant differences in pharmacokinetic outcomes were observed between groups . As analyses evaluated mean differences instead of GMRs, we could not exclude type II error and graded the strength of evidence as insufficient for clinically significant interactions. 72 Omega -3 fatty acids. Three open -label randomized crossover studies in 24 to 50 healthy adult volunteers investigated interactions between omega -3 fatty acids an d various statins. 36,93,95 Each study compared statin fatty acids versus statin alone over a 14 -day period. Insufficient evidence for interactions with simvastatin precluded meaningful conclusions about interactions be cause ES-25 pharmacokinetic outcomes were analyzed as differences in arithmetic means , yielding nonsignificant results with potential for type II error.95 Interactions with rosuvastatin or atorvastatin were unclear because for some of the pharmacokinetic outcomes there was low - strength evidence suggesting no clinically relevant interactions, while for other important pharmacokinetic outcomes the strength of evidence was graded as insufficient .36,93 Other supplements . No studies were found examining pharmac okinetic interactions between a cardiovascular drug and coenzyme Q10, magnesium, niacin (no more than 250 mg /day), red yeast rice extract, resveratrol, vitamin A, vitamin D with or without calcium supplementation, vitamin E, or vitamin K. Key Question 4a . Do the effect estimates of pharmacokinetic outcomes vary by age, ethnicity, gender, or health status? A paucity of evidence for supplement-drug combinations precluded exploration of heterogeneity in terms of preidentified subgroups such as age and gender. Key Question 4b. Is there a measurable interaction between cardiovascular drugs and dietary supplements for pharmacokinetic outcomes? Statistical interaction data were not reported in any pharmacokinetic study. Discussion Patients with cardiovascular disease commonly take d ietary supplements along with prescription drugs, but this review uncovered a paucity of high-quality research into benefits and interactions of drugs co administered with some of the most common supplements. No trials were identified for most potential combinations, while those that were found were generally underpowered efficacy trials of short duration in highly selected populations. Clinical outcomes were reported in a s parse collection of inconclusive trials; therefor e, evidence on important gradable clinical outcomes was rated insufficient. Findings of note include inconsistent evidence of decrease in rates of coronary artery restenosis following successful angioplasty with coadministration of omega- 3 fatty acids in two trials with aspirin and other cardiovascular drugs. Also, evidence from a well- powered pragmatic trial in women showed no benefit of adding vitamin E to daily aspirin on the composite outcome of nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and vascular death; evidence on individual vascular events was not available. For most intermediate outcomes of efficacy , such as lipid profile, blood pressure, and INR , we found either insufficient evidence or evidence of low strength demonstrating no effect; however, evidence indicated that omega -3 fatty acids (2 to 4 g/day ) likely do not interfere with the efficacy of statin therapy or calcium channel blockers in the presence of antiplatelet agents , but may provide independent benefit in resolving hypertriglyceridemia. There is evidence of low strength that supplemental vitamin K (0.1 to 0.15 mg/day) may help to stabilize INR when given with warfarin. Also, garlic (4 to 10 g/day) may not interact negatively with nitrates and warfarin , and may confer independent benefit in improving HDL-C and total cholesterol. However, our confidence in the validity and reproducibility of these benefits on intermediate outcomes is low. Safety of intake of dietary supplements concomitant with prescription cardiovascular medications is largely unclear due to insufficient evidence. Evidence regarding benefit of ES-26 coenzyme Q10 in reducing myalgia in participants with statin -induced myopathic pain is based on two small RCTs and is inconclusive. One study found benefit of supplementation of coenzyme Q10 versus vitamin E added to sta tins, while another pilot study reported no significant differences between groups using simvastatin with or without coenzyme Q10 in myalgia and tolerance for statin therapy. Evidence of low strength demonstrated no clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions when Echinacea, ginger, or Ginkgo biloba were co administered with warfarin or when G. biloba was coadministered with ticlopidine. Insufficient or conflicting evidence addressed most other supplement-drug pharmacokinetic interactions. Without an adequate evidence base from the literature, variability in effects across clinically important subgroups (e.g., age, ethnicity, gender , and health status) could not be assessed. Limitations of our systematic review process include our restriction of the number of dietary supplements of interest to 16 of the most commonly used; this was necessary given limitations of resources and review time. Up to 30 percent of included studies were assessed to have potential for financial conflict of interest , and approximately 45 percent did not report funding information. Given the uncertainties involved in interpreting asymmetry tes ts for publication bias in most reviews, especially in the presence of heterogeneity in effect estimates, we did not plan to investigate publication bias in this review. 102,103 In fact, a recent recommendation is that tests for funnel plot asymmetry should be used only in a minority of meta- analyses that include at least 10 studies of unequal sizes per analysis without substantial heterogeneity in their effect sizes.104 We did not adopt other means of evaluating publication bias and selective outcome reporting, such as comparing publications with study protocol, because of time and resource limitations. Seemingly , another limitation could be the exclusion of indirect evidence of drug interactions derived from surrogate measures , such as alterations in probe drug metabolism, that highlight effects on enzymes involved in drug metabolism. As such evidence traditionally originates in healthy volunteers, the applicability of such evidence would have been as much of a concern as for the pharmacokinetic outcomes we examined , whose applicability was restricted to healthy volunteers with uncompromised drug metabolism. In order to make causal inferences possible for translation into practice, we also excluded combinations of multiple dietary supplements with cardiovascular drugs. For example, a given combination of multivitamins coadministered with a cardiovascular drug or drugs would be limited both in causal inference of supplement-drug(s) interactions and in applicability to the specific doses and combinations of vitamins employed as intervention in the study. Finally, we considered potential benefits, harm, or bioequivalence independently for pharmacokinetic outcomes, according to the FDA guidance. 30 In the absence of guidance regarding intermediate outcomes, we did not draw conclusions on the two sides of clinical decisionmaking, such as \"unknown benefit but harm is unlikely\" and \"unknown harm but bene fit is unlikely.\" Available evidence poorly addresses the safety and effectiveness of co administration of dietary supplements with cardiovascular drugs . Given the steady increase in the use of dietary supplements for self-care and the identified gaps in research, we make the following recommendations for future research . 1. First and foremost, future research with dietary supplements should involve substances for which the identity of the agents can be clearly ascertained and the chemical composition well characterized and , ideally, standardized. If the active ingredients or biologic activity of these substances is not known, then studies to characterize these variables, identify mechanisms of action , and describe safety should precede clinical ES-27 efficacy studies. According to the 2011-15 strategic plan of the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine ( NCCAM), clinical trials of dietary supplements will not be supported without documentation of biology and mechanism of action. 105 2. As extant literature is largely based on few small -size efficacy studies of limited internal validity examining intermediate outcomes, future supplement- cardiovascular drug interaction trials should focus on meaningful clinical outcomes, be appropriately powered and rigorously conducted and reported, and provide precise measurements of both clinical effectiveness and harms outcomes . 3. Most studies were conducted in specialty settings, excluded patients with comorbidities or uncontrolled comorbi dities, and did not include et hnic and racial minorities; prospective trials should be representative of the population taking cardiovascular drugs in terms of comorbidities, setting, and racial distribution. They should also collect data and undertake subgroup analysis for age, gender, race, comorbidities ( e.g., liver or renal compromise), and genotypic polymorphisms of the cytochrome P450 enzyme. 4. A substantial number of pharmacokinetic interaction studies did not report and analyze pharmacokinetic outcomes according to FDA guidance for bioequivalence studies. 30 Future experiments of drug interactions must evaluate pharmacokinetic outcomes as geometric mean ratios with predefined margins of bioequivalence. Future studies of drug interactions must report pharmacokinetic outcomes as geometric mean ratios. This would allow statistically allow statistically significant as well as nonsignificant outcomes to be interpreted in terms of clinical significance , using predefined margins of bioequivalence. 5. Given the dearth of studies examining interactions between specific supplements and cardiovascular drugs, future clinical trials and observational studies that explore the effect of cardiovascular drugs should additionally assess the use of dietary supplements and include this in the reporting of results. One way to facilitate this would be to consider inclusion of inquiry about dietary supplement use and other CAM care in reporting guidelines such as CONSORT (CONsolidated Standards of Reporting Trials). 6. Phase I trials of cardiovascular drugs should include older populations and, if possible, a pharmacokinetic assessment that includes dietary supplement usage. 7. As subgroups were underrepresented in existing studies, future studies investigating supplement-drug interactions should examine vulnerable subgroups such as the elderly, those with compromised renal and liver functions, and patients with multiple comorbidities . 8. When possible, comparative effectiveness studies should include a statistical analysis for supplement-drug interactions, and the trials should be powered accordingly. 9. Until well-powered experimental studies are conducted to examine dietary supplement - drug coadministration , evidence from well-conducted prospective observational studies should be sought. Observational studies compliant with STROBE (STrengthening the Reporting of OB servational studies in Epidemiology) guidelines should be powered appropriately to address predefined endpoints of both efficacy and safety in a naturalistic setting, where the population sampled is reflective of the population for wh ich these data would be meaningful . 106 10. Given the difficulty and resource- intensive nature of clinical trials, other sources of data should be considered to derive information regarding drug-dietary supplement interactions. Possibilities include synthesis of reports of adverse events made to both ES-28 FDA and the Pharmacovigilance program at Health Canada. In addition, electronic health record linkages between databases of dietary supplement use and cardiovascular drug prescription may also add to the sparse evidence o n supplement-cardiovascular drug interaction that currently exist s.

PMID: 18064739. 1 Introduction Vascular disease is a preventable condition that is the leading contributor to mortality in the United States107, and second place in Canada after cancer.108 Vascular disease includes peripheral vascular disease evident in hypertension; cardiovascular disease such as angina pectoris, myocardial infarction and heart failure; and cerebrovascular disease such as transient ischemic attack (TIA) and stroke. The American Heart Association estimates that more than 81 million American adults (one - third of all American adults) have at least one form of cardiovascular disease (CVD) , broadly defined to include all vascular disease. 1 While there has been progress in the control of CVD, it demands huge investments from the health care system and represents great burdens and lost opportunities for individuals, families and society overall. In addition to lifestyle and dietary recommendations, front line treatment for prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease is primarily pharmaceutical, with patients requiring on average 6.3 concomitant prescription drugs, from on average 5.9 different drug classes, for primary and secondary prevention of the disease itself and management of associated comorbidities. 2-4 The prescription drugs considered in this review are summarized in Table 1. Table 1. Cardiovascular drugs of interest Cardiovascular Drug Category Drug Class Drugs of Interest Beta 2 Table 1. Cardiovascular drugs of interest (continued) Cardiovascular Drug Category Drug Class Drugs of Interest Vasodilators more than 250 mg/day doses was considered to be a dietary supplement. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) refers to preventive and therapeutic modalities not generally considered to be part of conventional medicine,5 including dietary supplements. CAM utilization has increased dr amatically in North America over the past decades in both the general and cardiovascular disease populations.6,7 The National Health 3 Interview Survey (NHIS) indicated that a total of $34 billion in annual out-of-pocket expenditures was spent on CAM in 2007.8 Of this amount, 44 percent was spent on non- vitamin, non-mineral supplements.8 Estimates suggest that approximately one -third to nearly two-thirds of people suffering from heart failure or other cardiovascular disease use some form of dietary supplements, and are thus placed at risk for potential adverse events from interactions among pharmacologically active agents. 7,9-11 To further complicate the issue, dietary supplements in the US are not regulated in the same manner as drugs. According to the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, manufacturers of supplements are not held to the same st andards as manufacturers of prescription and over-the-counter drugs with respect to providing evidence of efficacy and safety prior to marketing. 109 Furthermore, dietary supplements are not required to obtain United States Food and D rug Administration (FDA) approval, nor are there any FDA regulations that require evidence of purity, quality or composition prior to marketing. These products are available in pharmacies, grocery stores, health food stores, and via the internet , and are often consumed by patients without the knowledge of their care providers under the mistaken impression that supplements are safe, or without adverse effects. The purported benefits of dietary supplements are widespread and largely unsubstantiated. Many supplements have been suggested to be beneficial in various forms of cardiovascular disease (i.e., coenzyme Q10, omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin E for cardioprotection, garlic for hypercholesterolemia, hawthorn for congestive heart failure) with varying levels of evidence supporting these claims . 110 The dietary supplements considered in this review, and the proposed mechanisms of action for selected supplements with purported cardiovascular benefits, are summarized in Table 2.

The following vitamin analog forms are considered pharmaceutical drugs and were therefore excluded: Analogs of vitamin A disease; A; LDL -C = low density lipoprotein cholesterol. People at risk of or suffering from cardiovascular disease often take dietary supplements alongside prescribed drugs. The use of supplements may complement standard care, or may have a detrimental effect on the pharmacodynamics or pharmacokinetics of standard care. Given the uncertainty, and potential for harm, we need to understand better the risks and benefits, or lack thereof, associated with concomitant usage. An example whereby the addition of a dietary supplement may confer benefit would be combining coenzyme Q10 with statin therapy. Amongst other actions, coenzyme Q10 has been 5 shown to lower cholesterol, specifically low-density lipoprotein cholesterol,6 and while not proven, it is plausible coenzyme Q10 r educes myalgia associated with statin therapy.111,112 Alternatively, the concomitant use of dietary supplements and cardiovascular drugs may lead to detrimental outcomes directly ( i.e., either clinical or surrogate outcomes) or indirectly. For example, key factors within coagulation pathways are directly affected by garlic, fish oil, fenugreek, saw palmetto, Ginkgo biloba and danshen, which all have been shown to inhibit blood coagulation.10,113-115 However, increased bleeding is a serious potential risk when these dietary supplements are coupled with common anticoagulants like aspirin, warfarin, or ticlopidine. Conversely other supplements, even a seemingly innocuous one like green tea extract, that contains vitamin K, may counteract the anticoagulant effects of certain drugs and thus limit their effectiveness . 116 Similarly, drug -dietary supplement interactions can negatively impact surrogate outcomes, as illustrated by metabolic enzyme induction. St. John's wort for example, taken often for the treatment of depression, is a potent inducer of the CYP3A4 enzyme. 117 This enzyme is involved in the oxidative metabolism of many synthetic drugs,114,115,118 -121 angiotensin receptor antagonists, and anticoagulants.10,114,116 Increasing the metabolism of any of these drugs with use of this popular herbal product could reduce their effectiveness and potentially result in serious clinical consequences. Conversely, if prescription medication dosage is adjusted in the context of regular ingestion of a CYP3A4 enzyme inhibitor, then supplement cessation may result in excessive drug levels with other serious clinical consequences. Concomitant use of dietary supplements and cardiovascul ar drugs may also affect clinically relevant outcomes indirectly. Risks for both non- adherence and interactions inevitably increase with the number of medications and supplements taken, and this is of greatest concern in the elderly. 12,13 In addition to concerns of polypharmac y, the elderly also experience physiological changes that make them more susceptible to interactions, as a consequence of alterations in metabolism and excretion, affecting both pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics. 122,123 The increasing morbidity that occurs within older populations suffering from CVD, in conjunction with greater potential for drug interactions, makes this subgroup particularly important to explore. Thus, understanding the potential for drug-supplement interactions and consequenc es of such interactions is essential for clinicians and patients when prescribing medications, or advising or deciding to add dietary supplements to current medication and supplement regimes. Incorporation in clinical practice of knowledge regarding the impact of concomitant use of cardiovascular disease medications and dietary supplements requires access to reliable drug - supplement information, as well as a commitment to documentation by clinicians. 15,16 As a consequence of U.S. drug regulatory policy, much more research and data are available describing drug-drug interactions than drug-supplement interactions. C omprehensive systematic review of interactions between dietary supplements and drugs specifically in patients taking prescription medications for cardiovascular disease is clearly needed. Recently published systematic reviews addressing aspects related to this topic are not com prehensive, or focus on different populations of interest. 115,119,121 This synthesis evaluates literature that addresses meaningful clinical outcomes, as well as important surrogate or intermediate outcomes, in the context of patients concurrently taking prescription drugs and dietary supplements for prevention and treatment o f CVD. The Key Questions examined in this review are as follows: 6 In adults taking cardiovascular drugs, what are the effects of concomitant use of specific dietary supplements (when compared to cardiovascular drugs alone or cardiovascular drugs and a different dietary supplement[s]) on: 1. clinical cardiovascular effectiveness/efficacy outcomes (e.g., mortality and specific cardiovascular or cerebrovascular conditions such as myocardial infarction [MI] and stroke)? (a) Do the effect estimates of clinical cardiovascular outcomes vary by age, ethnicity, gender, or health status? (b) Is there a measurable interaction between cardiovascular drugs and dietary supplements for clinical cardiovascular outcomes? 2. intermediate cardiovascular efficacy outcomes (e.g., lipi ds, blood pressure, electrocardiographic measurements, serum markers, bleeding, and coagulation times)? (a) Do the effect estimates of intermediate cardiovascular outcomes vary by age, ethnicity, gender, or health status? (b) Is there a measurable interaction betw een cardiovascular drugs and dietary supplements for intermediate cardiovascular outcomes? 3. clinical or intermediate harms outcomes (e.g., organ toxicity, serious adverse events, withdrawal due to adverse events)? (a) Do the effect estimates of harms outcomes v ary by age, ethnicity, gender, or health status? (b) Is there a measurable interaction between cardiovascular drugs and dietary supplements for harms outcomes? 4. pharmacokinetic outcomes (e.g., T1/2, area under the concentration curve [AUC]) of cardiovascular dr ugs of interest? (a) Do the effect estimates of pharmacokinetic outcomes vary by age, ethnicity, gender, or health status? (b) Is there a measurable interaction between cardiovascular drugs and dietary supplements for pharmacokinetic outcomes?7 Methods The methods for this Comparative Effectiveness Review follow the methods suggested in the Methods Reference Guide for Effectiveness and Comparative Effectiveness Reviews, Version 1.0 published by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ).17 Unless stated otherwise, all methods and analyses were determined a priori and documented in a research protocol that was publicly posted by AHRQ for comments. Screening of literature and inclusion/exclusion of studies were tracked and presented according to the PRISMA methodology. 124 Topic Development and Refinement This evidence report addresses several Key Questions regarding the effects of concomitant use of specific dietary supplements and cardiovascular drugs compared with cardiovascular drugs alone or with different dietary supplements. The original topic nomination was for a comparative effectiveness review (CER) of the risks and benefits for elderly patients taking cardiovascular medication concomitantly with herbal supplements. Discussions wer e held with Key Informants representing the FDA, the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) , and several other institutions on scope of the topic, research questions to be asked, and methodology of evidence synthesis to be adopted. The panel included clinicians (e.g., cardiologists, naturopathic doctors, a clinical pharmacology specialist, and a nutritionist), a patient (consumer), and systematic review research methodologists. As preliminary searching indicated scarce data in the elderly subgroup, it was decided with the Key Informants to broaden the review topic to the benefits and risks of dietary supplement use in adults taking drugs for prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease (CVD) . Subgroups of interest were added to a preliminary list of demographic and clinical categories that included those with renal dysfunction and genetic polymorphisms in CYP2D6, 2C9, and 2C19. Drug-functional food and drug-conventional food interactions were considered but it was decided that should be evaluated as a separate research project due to the size of such an undertaking . Five research Key Question s were finalized in the topic refinement process regarding the comparative efficacy, effectiveness, harms and pharmacokinetics of a dietary supplement co administered with a cardiovascular drug. Subquestions sought to investigate subgroup effects and evidence of specific drug -supplement statistical interaction. An indirect question enquired about evidence based on human studies that some of the most commonly used dietary supplements cause alterations in cytochrome P450 isozyme activity and in cellular drug transport mechanisms. All dietary supplements, according to the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA) definit ion, were of investigational interest. The dietary supplement was defined as one of the following substances: a vitamin; a mineral; an herb or other botanical; an amino acid ; a dietary substance for use by man to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake (e.g., enzymes or tissues from organs or glands); or a concentrate, metabolite, constituent or extract. 8 Furthermore, it must also conform to the following criterion: intended for ingestion in pill, capsule, tablet, powder or liquid form not represented for use as a conventional food or as the sole item of a meal or diet . AHRQ's Effective Health Care Program posted the proposed Key Questions for public comment on their Web site from August 16 through September 13, 2010. In response, the following five general comments were received: (1) the review scope should be restricted to the most common dietary supplements and cardiovascular drugs; ( 2) the review should focus on patient-oriented outcomes ; (3) the review should examine issues related to quality, dose and purity of the dietary supplements of interest; ( 4) the review should distinguish between regular and occasional users of dietary supplements; ( 5) the review should distinguish between nutrient and non-nutrient supplements. T he Evidence-based Practice Center (EPC), with input from Key Informants and the Technical Expert Panel (TEP) , reviewed and refined the Key Question s to ensure that the questions were specific and explicit about what information was being reviewed. Protocol and Project Scope Amendment The review according to the approved topic refinement document was proven to require resources beyond those allocated to the EPC center . The search of included data bases yielded more than 32,000 records; beyond expectations founded on targeted search during topic refinement. A random 10 percent title, abstract and full text screening was conducted to estimate the final size of the review and the projected number of included studies was beyond review resources . Several telephone and e- mail discussions were held with the TEP members and the Task Order Officer. Finally, three modifications were made as an amendment to the original research protocol based on the topic refinement document: Restrict to dietary supplements commonly used in adults and elderly taking cardiovascular medication for which current evidence on possible drug-supplement interaction is lacking . With input from the TEP, and surveys of the general and cardiovascular populations in the Unites States reported in literature, 7,18-23 the revised list of dietary supplements was arrived at as follows: A. dietary supplements commonly perceived to provide cardiovascul ar benefit, with a high probability of being used simultaneously with carotene; vitamin D ; vitamin E ;omega-3 fatty acids or fish oils; niacin ; and magnesium. B. other dietary supplements commonly used by the population using cardiovascular drugs, for which there is some reason to believe there may be an interaction with cardiovascular drugs: Echinacea; St. John's wort; red yeast rice; resver atrol; hawthorn; and vitamin K. C. supplements falling into categories A or B may be omitted from the list if there is already well understood interaction and a review would be redundant. On this basis, it was proposed that these be excluded: St . Johns wort ; therapeutic doses of niacin (greater than 250 mg /day); and magnesium as infusion or injection. Eliminate the indirect question enquiring about alterations in cytochrome P450 isozyme activity and in cellular drug transport mechanisms . Restrict foreign -language report inclusion to German only. 9 Language restriction was based on the fact that during the screening of the 10 percent random sample of a total of 32, 000 records, most commonly identified foreign languages were German (24 percent), Russian (16 percent ), and Chinese (44 percent), comprising 84 percent of reports in language other than English. Other languages included Norwegian (4 percent) , and Italian, Polish, Swedish, Dutch, and French ( 2 percent each). Because of uncertain applicability of Russian and Chinese language studies to the United States population and settings, the only foreign language considered to be eligible was German. The list of relevant dietary supplements, rationale for the above-mentioned project scope amendments, and other de tails, are presented in the Table 3 below. Table 3.

Development of the Analytic Framework The analytic framework depicts the causal pathways forming the basis of the Key Question s (Figure 1). The framework outlines the conceptual basis or expectations for adding a dietary supplement to prescribed cardiovascular drugs. Expectations include improvement in efficacy and reduction in harms related to cardiovascular drugs. Outcomes that represent these changes may be clinical, surrogate (proxy for clinical), or pharmacokinetic. Altered outcomes may be a result of an add-on effect of the dietary supplement and/or supplement-drug interaction. Drug interactions may be seen as biologic (i.e., pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic interactions reflected in alter ed clinical and surrogate outcomes of benefit and harms) or statistical. 125 Statistical interactions measure biologic interactions in terms of a product term added to a linear model. The Key Question s posed therefore examine whether outcomes of benefit and harms change with the addition of a dietary supplement. In addition, they examine pharmacokinetic and statistical interactions. In the context of the population of interest, the Key Question s are indicated along the corresponding arrows connecting treatment and outcomes of interest. The framework includes 10 seven sections. The first section represents the adult population, within which the target population is included. The remaining six sections are: (1) target population (adults taking cardiovascular drugs commonly used in the outpatient setting ); (2) treatment (dietary supplements); ( 3) intermediate outcomes/ biological effects (lipid levels, blood pressure, electrocardiogram measurements, other serum markers , and diagnostic tests ); (4) clinical outcomes (mortality, ischemic heart disease, arrhythmias, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral arterial disease, cardiovascular disease surgery and procedures, and quality of life ); (5) harms (allergic reactions, significant bleeding, and neurological and gastrointestinal adverse events ); and (6) pharmacokinet ic outcomes ( measures of drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion). Figure 1. Analytic framework Abbreviations: CVD = cardiovascular disease; ECG = electrocardiography; KQ = Key Question. Literature Search Strategy An experienced medical information specialist developed and tested the electronic search strategies by using a combination of controlled vocabulary and free text , in consultation with the team. An independent information specialist peer- reviewed the search strategies according to the PRESS checklist.126 To identify primary study reports (see Appendix A), we searched the following electronic databases: Ovid MEDLINE\u00ae In-Process and other Non-Indexed Citations, and Ovid MEDLINE\u00ae (1950 to Sept 1, 2011); Embase (1980 to Sept 1, 2011); Cochrane Library via the Wiley interface KQ2 a & b KQ4 a & b KQ3 a & b Adults Target population Adults taking cardiovascular drugs commonly used in outpatient settings Dietary supplements Harms Pharmacokinetic outcomes Intermediate outcomes/Biological effects Lipids ECG measurements Blood pressure Other diagnostic tests Other serum markers Clinical outcomes Mortality Peripheral vascular (arterial) disease Ischemic heart disease CVD surgery and procedures Arrhythmias Quality of life Other heart disease Others Nonfatal cerebrovascular disease KQ1 a & b 11 (Sept 1 2011) including Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects , and Health Technology Assessment Database and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ; International Bibliographic Information on Dietary Supplements (IBIDS) on October 26, 2010; and Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED) 1985 to September 1, 2011. We used controlled vocabulary (e.g., \"Dietary Supplements,\" \"Drugs, Chinese Herbal ,\" \"Phytotherapy\") and keywords (e.g., nutritional supplements, garlic, ginger) in combination with controlled vocabulary and keywords related to cardiovascular agents. A broad range of controlled vocabulary was used to address the various synonyms associated with this topic, as well as to cover any evolutionary gaps associated with the introduction of certain vocabulary terms. Results were refined using filters for systematic reviews, RCTs, non -RCTs and observational studies, and safety. A more specific strategy related solely to herb-drug interactions was run in the same databases using only a systematic review filter. To identify systematic reviews addressing research questions similar to the Key Question s outlined for this review, we used a slightly modified strategy from that indicated above, by including a systematic review filter (for MEDLINE and E mbase) and limiting the search of the Cochrane Library to the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, and the Health Technology Assessment Database (see Appendix Y). The identification of relevant systematic reviews addressing any one of the Key Questions would serve the purpose of replacing a de novo process involving primary synthesis with existing systematic reviews. We restricted our searches to human studies without imposing any language or date restrictions. We attempted to identify unpublished literature (including abstracts and conference proceedings) through searches of trial registries ( e.g., ClinicalTrials.gov, Current Controlled Trials, Clinical Study Results, World Health Organization Clinical Trials), the Cambridge Scientific Abstracts (CSA) Conference Papers Index, and Scopus. Additional references were identified by scanning bibliographies of relevant systematic reviews and clinical trials. We also contacted Technical Expert Panel (TEP) members. Through the Scientific Resource Center, we contacted the industry (see Appendix B for list of drug manufacturers contacted) for scientific information packets (SIPs) on drug-supplement interaction and requested: a current product label; randomized controlled trials, published or unpublished; and observational studies, published or unpublished . All identified citations were downloaded into a Reference Manager 12 127 database for duplicate removal and early analysis. The unique references were then uploaded into DistillerSR ,128 a review management Web application. Study Selection Process Description The reviewers involved in initial screening attended a screening training session and pilot tested the screening forms. Titles were screened by one reviewer; all exclusions were independently screened by a second reviewer. A similar process of screening was followed to screen abstracts of studies that passed the title screen. Two reviewers independently screened the full text of all included records. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus. 12 Eligibility Criteria for Systematic Reviews When available, topically relevant reviews were to be included to answer one or more of the Key Question s. As per the Cochrane Collaboration definition,129 a systematic review includes: a specific research question; a search strategy (e.g., sources such as electronic databases, period covered by the search); and methods used to assess the risk of bias of studies included in the review. Narrative reviews were excluded. We limited our review to those systematic reviews judged to be of \"Good\" quality (see below for how quality of a review was assessed). R easons for exclusion were noted. We planned to replace de novo evidence synthesis with good quality systematic review evidence only when it was deemed current , obviating the need to update. Eligibility Criteria for Primary Studies We aimed to include hypothesis- testing as opposed to hypothesis generating studies (case- reports and series). We thus included experimental and observational comparative studies (i.e., those with independent controls) evaluating the benefits or harms of concomitant dietary supplement use in adults taking cardiovascular medications versus no dietary supplement (or other dietary supplement). In a post hoc decision , we expanded the study design criteria to allow inclusion of single arm controlled before- after pharmacokinetic studies in which posttreatment values were compared with baseline values. This was because we considered such evidence as a reasonable comparison between drug -supplement and drug alone for pharmacokinetic outcomes when an adequate washout period was employed. T his review was limited to human studies with specific eligibility criteria presented in Table 4. Table 4. Study inclusion criteria Population KQs 1-4 Adult participants (the majority of participants 16 years of age or with subgroup data presented for adults) taking at least one specific cardiovascular drug or one specific class of cardiovascular drugs such as -adrenergic antagonists , antiarrhythmic drugs, anticoagulants, antilipemic agents, antiplatelet agents, channel antagonists, diuretic s, inotropic agents, renin- angiotensin-aldosterone system antagonists, and phosphodiesterase inhibitors, prostaclyclin derivates, endothelin anatagonsts, etc) The drugs were restricted to those commonly used in U.S. outpatient settings for treatment and prevention of cardiovascular disorders.

Report Characteristics KQs 1-4 No limits on publication year or status Publication language: Systematic reviews: limited to English Primary studies: limited to the English language or German Abbreviations: CVD = cardiovascular disease; KQ = Key Question . Data Extraction and Data Management Prior to data abstraction, we iteratively developed and pilot tested a standardized data extraction form. One reviewer extracted relevant data from each study and a second reviewer independently verified data from a 10 percent random sample of studies. In contrast with data pertaining to other Key Question s, where errors were few and sporadic (less than 0.5 percent) , we noted some missed harms outcomes ; therefore a second reviewer verified that all reported outcomes data of interest were extracted. Before this harms data verification was carried out, we clarified understanding of the reporting of harms. For example, we decided that when authors reported regular laboratory harms surveillance by testing for liver enzym es, glomerular filtration 15 rate, blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine, and then disclosed that no adverse events were identified, zero patients with events of raised levels of these enzymes should be extracted. Likewise a statement that no thrombotic ev ent was identified was extracted as zero patients with stroke, angina and myocardial infarction. We could not generate extractable harms data from reports stating for example, \"no significant adverse events were observed ,\" \"no adverse effects of clinical i mportance occurred ,\" or \"all remaining adverse events were mild in severity .\" We extracted all harms data, not merely those thought to be drug related . Discrepancies in data extractions were resolved through discussions or with a help of third reviewer. Data extractors were not blinded to study information. If a study was reported in multiple publications, we extracted data from the latest and/or most complete publication and supplemented it with data from companion publications, as appropriate. We sought additional information from authors, when necessary. Data were input into DistillerSR. 128 During the data extraction process, one reviewer with clinical background rated study populations' 10- year CHD risk as per Table 5 below, according to the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP, ATP III) guidelines.24 When all participants were h ealthy non-smokers, study level 10- year CHD risk was categorized as low. Table 5. Ten-year coronary heart disease risk strata used to categorize study participants Category Details High risk (10-year risk >20%) A Participants with established coronary heart disease, i.e., anyone or more of the following: coronary death, acute coronary syndromes, myocardial infarction, angina, heart failure, and coronary artery procedures (angioplasty or bypass surgery) B Participants with noncoronary form of atherosclerotic disease, i.e., anyone or more of the following: peripheral arterial disease, abdominal aortic aneurysm, and carotid artery disease (transient ischemic attacks or stroke of carotid origin or > 50% obstruction of a carotid artery) C Those diagnosed with diabetes or those reported in the paper as high risk according to NCEP ATP III criteria Moderate to moderately high risk (10-year risk <10% to maximum of 20%) Two or more of the following risk factors in >80% of participants: cigarette smoking, hypertension (BP 140/90 mmHg or on antihypertensive medication), low HDL -C (<40 mg/dL), family history of premature CHD (CHD in male first -degree relative <55 years; CHD in female first -degree relative <65 years), age (men 45 years; women 55 years) Low risk (0 -1 risk factors) Zero or just one of the above risk factors Mixed risk Participants clearly in more than one of the above categories Unclear risk Participants could be in one or a mix of the above categories Abbreviations: BP = blood pressure; CHD = coronary heart disease; HDL -C = high density lipoprotein-cholesterol ; NCEP ATP III = National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III. There was some additional attrition after studies were included during screening. Of the included studies, we extracted data when the following additional criteria were met: The dietary supplement was added to one or more cardiovascular drug(s) that were all taken by 100 percent or the majority (at least 80 percent) of participants in randomized controlled trials ; Nonrandomized controlled trials, or observational studies reported effect estimates reflective of a supplement plus drug(s) versus drug(s) alone comparison (or with another supplement); 16 Studies reported, or data could be obtained from authors, for at least one relevant outcome; The design of the study was lower in the hierarchy of evidence (i.e., nonrandomized experimental or observational study in presence of higher RCT evidence), and did not meaningfully add (by not being a longer- term or pragmatic study reporting conclusive results) to the already included evidence from a higher study design category; Studies were on a cardiovascular drug not marketed in the U.S.A.; Dosing of the die tary supplement was specified. Remaining studies were transparently eliminated from data synthesis with reasons. Extracted Data Elements The following elements were extracted: Study and report characteristics (first author, study design, study setting, duration of followup, year and language of publication, funding source, treatment sequence generation, treatment allocation concealment, use of blinding) Population characteristics (inclusion/exclusion criteria, number of enrolled and analyzed participants, age, gender, ethnicity/race, health status, comorbidities, baseline nutrient exposures and/or background diet, methods used to assess baseline nutrient exposures, specific cardiovascular drugs and drug classes, drug doses, dose regimens, duration of treatment, potential confounders such as blood pressure, concomitant medication, smoking, lipid levels, number and reasons for withdrawals or drop-outs) Intervention characteristics (name, brand, and country of manufacturer of a dietary supplement or extract, license/registration of the product in the country of manufacture, source from which a dietary supplement or extract was manufactured, method of authentication, dosage regimen and quantitative description, dose form, qualitative testing for authenticity of herbal species, purity assessment for contamination/substitution, standardization, storage conditions and length, methods and instruments for assessing nutrient-intake exposures including validation by using nutrient biomarkers) Control (comparator) interve ntion characteristics o Placebo - description/definition in placebo -controlled trials , duration of treatment, similarity of treatments ) o Other dietary supplement - same data as above Outcomes o Continuous measures (mean baseline and final values , within-treatment arm mean change, between -treatment arm mean difference, standard deviation, if reported means - the corresponding variance, standard error, 95 percent confidence interval) o Binary outcomes (number of participants with an event, risk of an event, odds of an event, risk ratio, odds ratio, hazard ratio, variance, standard error, 95 percent confidence interval, crude or adjusted measures of effect) o Definitions o Measurement method(s) o Timing of measurement o Data analysis details o Statistical test us ed 17 o Regression models (model type, covariates) For systematic reviews , we planned to extract data on the research question, search strategy, design of individual studies included in a review, risk of bias assessment methods, population characteristics (inclusion and exclusion criteria, type of cardiovascular drug intake), and treatment characteristics (name and type of dietary of supplement). Assessment of Study Risk of Bias and Quality of Systematic Reviews Risk of bias of individual studies was assessed according to outcomes. One reviewer assessed risk of bias of all individual primary studies (randomized trials, nonrandomized controlled trials, cohort, and case-control studies). The risk of bias for gradabl e outcomes was verified by two reviewers, while a random ten percent of risk of bias assessment was verified for other outcomes. Disagreements were resolved by discussions with a third team member. We used generic criteria to assess study risk of bias (Table 6). These criteria estimate risk of bias across five domains (selection bias, performance bias, attrition bias, detection bias, and other bias). The domains were tailored according to study design. For example, specific sub-domains such as randomization sequence generation were assessed only for randomized trials (parallel arm and crossover ). Crossover randomized trials were assessed with the following additional criteria: appropriateness of crossover design; washout period (the length of time had to be at least 3 times the half life of drug elimination); and the report of appropriate data analysis (i.e., based on within-subject differences). The subdomain of blinding (within the Performance Bias domain) of participants , healthcare providers, and outcome assessors to treatment allocation was assessed only for experimental designs (i.e. , randomized and non- randomized trials). We assessed the completeness of outcome data (i.e., attrition bias due to loss to followup or withdrawals) by comparing the number of participants who entered the study with the number of participants reported in outcome table(s). We then assessed whether there was complete followup of all participants, small lost to followup ( less than 20 percent) or differential lost to followup. Other forms of bias assessed included potential financial conflict of interest and selected criteria from the McMaster Quality Assessment Scale of Harms (McHarm) . 25 All domains had response options of \"Y es,\" \"No,\" or \"U nclear\" with allowance for justifications of such judgments. For each gradable outcome in a study we provided an overall risk of bias rating designated as high, moderate, or low ( Table 7). In order to be classified as high risk of bias, a study must have demonstrated some apparent and major flaw (within that study design category) that would invalidate results. 18 Table 6.

Abbreviation: RCT = randomized controlled trial. 19 Table 7. Overall risk of bias ratings Low risk of bias. These studies have the least bias and results are considered valid. Examples of characteristics of these studies include the following: a formal randomized controlled design; clear description of the population, setting, interventions, and comparison groups; appropriate measurement of outcomes; appropriate statistical and analytic methods and reporting; no reporting errors; low dropout rate; and clear reporting of dropouts. Moderate risk of bias. These studies are susceptible to some bias, but it is not sufficient to invalidate the results. They do not meet all the criteria required for a rating of low risk of bias because they have some deficiencies, but no flaw is likely to cause major bias. Study deficiency may be missing information, making it difficult to assess limitations and potential problems. High risk of bias. These studies have significant flaws that imply biases of various types that may invalidate the results. They have serious errors in design, analysis, or reporting; large amounts of missing information; or discrepancies in reporting. Methodological quality of included systematic reviews was assessed using the AMSTAR tool,131 which rates each systematic review with a \"Yes,\" \"No,\" \"Cannot answer, \" or \"Not applicable\" across the 11 domains . The overall assessment of quality for each systematic review was based on a reviewer's overall judgment given their responses to the individual AMSTAR items, and had three overall ratings: \"Good,\" \" Fair,\" or \"Poor.\" In general, \"Good\" quality systematic reviews were defined as those having few or no methodol ogical/reporting shortcomings (low risk of bias). \" Fair\" quality systematic reviews were defined as those having some methodological flaws although not sufficient to seriously bias or invalidate the review results. \"Poor\" quality systematic reviews were de fined as those having serious flaws sufficient to seriously bias or invalidate the review results, and were not eligible for inclusion in the evidence synthesis . An independent reviewer helped to resolve any discrepancies regarding the AMSTAR tool assessment between the reviewers. Grading the Strength of the Body of Evidence In principle, a body of evidence originating in randomized trials starts with a presumed high strength of evidence, and is downgraded across the domains when there is important overall risk of bias of contributing studies, inconsistency in direction of intervention effect, indirectness of the outcome of interest (e.g., a surrogate outcome, rather than a clinical health outcome) and imprecision in effect estimates of an extent that neither important benefit nor harm can be ruled out. For nonrandomized studies, the body of evidence starts with a presumed low strength of evidence but may be upgraded across certain domains. The strength of a body of evidence was graded based on the following four domains, per previously published guidance: overall risk of bias by outcome, consistency, directness, and precision. 26 A methodologist and a content expert graded the strength of the body of evidence as \"High,\" \"Moderate, \" \"Low,\" or \"Insufficient\" (Table 8). A third methodologist with clinical background adjudicated to resolve disagreements. Given the results we found, optional domains such as dose- response association and existence of confounders were not applicable in this comparative effectiveness review. Given the uncertainties involved in interpreting asymmetry tests for publication bias in most reviews, especially in presence of heterogeneity in effect estimates, we did not plan to investigate publication bias in this review. 102,103 The strength of evidence was graded insufficient when there was no evidence for an outcome, when direction of estimates were inconsistent between studies without an identifiable cause, or when the body of evidence from the contributing study /studies was underpowered for the outcome of interest (imprecise estimate). That is, when the effect estimate associated with 20 confidence intervals was not only nonsignificant, but wide enough such that the clinical action would differ if the upper versus the lower boundary of the CI represented the truth, we rated the estimate as imprecise , reflecting our uncertainty about clinically important benefit s, harms or clinically unimportant differences in effect estimates between the contrasting interventions. Customarily only a subset of important outcomes are chosen to grade the strength of evidence\u2014outcomes that are most meaningful for decision making given a specific Key Question.26 In consultation with the Technical Expert Panel (TEP), the review team chose the following outcomes for grading the strength of the body of evidence: Key Question 1. Mortality (all- cause and vascular events (hemorrhagic/ischemic/unspecified st roke), quality of life, hospitalization, arrhythmia, and clinical outcomes of peripheral arterial disease Key Question 2. Blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), lipid profile (low density lipoprotein, high density lipoprotein, and non-high density lipoprotein cholesterol; and triglycerides), international normalised ratio for coumarin derivatives, incidence of metabolic syndrome, and change in 10 -year Framingham risk profile. Key Question 3. Serious adverse events (composite outcome according to the Food and Drug Administration definition of serious adverse events), 27 withdrawal due to adverse events, clinical bleeding (intracranial, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, subretinal, etc.), renal dysfunction (e.g., proteinuria, elevated creatinine, need for transplant, glomerular filtration rate), hepatotoxicity (elevated enzymes or fulminant failure), and QT prolongation Key Question 4. Area under the plasma cardiovascular drug concentration -time curve (AUC), maximum drug concentration (C max), drug half- life(t1/2), and oral clearance. Table 8. Strength of evidence grade and definition26 Grade Definition High High confidence that the evidence reflects the true effect. Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect. Moderate Moderate confidence that the evidence reflects the true effect. Further research may change our confidence in the estimate of effect, and may change the estimate. Low Low confidence that the evide nce reflects the true effect. Further research is likely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect, and is likely to change the estimate. Insufficient Evidence is either unavailable or does not permit a conclusion. Applicability We followed previously published guidance, and summarized the population, intervention, comparator, outcome, timing and setting (PICOTS) to assess the applicability of the body of evidence for outcomes or categories of similar outcomes.28 We considered age, race/ethnicity and gender representation; strictness of exclusion criteria; 10 -year CHD risk; study setting; whether or not the cardiovascular drug(s) was administered in therapeutic doses ; frequency of monitoring of adherence; surrogacy of outcomes; and short versus long- term treatment duration as important aspects determining applicability. Applicability is reported for all conclusive results. When direction of effect was indeterminate ei ther because of lack of evidence or under powered evidence (with imprecise and nonsignificant data), applicability of evidence was not reported. Studies that evaluated representative patient populations in usual or routine care conditions lasting long enough to meaningfully measure health outcomes of both benefit and harm while comparing the intervention with standard of care were considered pragmatic or 21 effectiveness studies as opposed to efficacy studies examining intermediate efficacy outcomes in highly selected patients less likely to experience harms.29 Data Synthesis and Analysis All analyses compared the combination of dietary supplement plus cardiovascular drug with cardiovascular drug alone (or plus placebo or another dietary supplement). The decision to meta-analyze or qualitatively synthesize outcome specific evidence from primary studies depended upon the presence or absence of homogeneity in clinical and methodological characteristics across studies, and the statistical format of outcome reporting. For pharmacokinetic outcomes in Key Question 4, we followed the FDA guidance for analysis and interpretation of drug interaction studies. 30 Because data are usually skewed, the guidance recommends that the pharmacokinetic outcomes in drug interaction studies be reported, after log transformation, as geometric mean ratios (GMR) with their 90 percent confidence intervals (CI) based on a procedure termed the 'two one-sided test procedure.' A conservative margin of bioequivalence for most drug interactions is recommended to be between the lower and upper bound 90 percent GMR CI of 0.8 and 1.25. We refer to this as the zone of clinical nonsignificance. Meta-analysis was considered, or studies were considered suitable for pooling if they were randomized trials that included similar populations in terms of demog raphics, morbidity, and intake of cardiovascular drug(s) or classes of drugs (e.g., participants aged 65 years or younger, healthy or with diabetes or history of myocardial infarction, use of warfarin or nitrates), compared the same type of dietary supplem ent (e.g., niacin, oral magnesium, fish oil) versus comparator treatment (e.g., other dietary supplement, no treatment, placebo), and reported the same outcome measures in the same statistical format ( e.g., mean difference or geometric mean ratios [GMR]). Where risk of bias differed across studies, this was explored by sensitivity analyses. We did not plan to meta- analyze observational and experimental studies; however, we pooled parallel with crossover randomized studies. 32 We did not consider pre- crossover data for synthesis except when it was judged that the treatment given to participants in a given crossover trial was not appropriate for the condition under consideration.31,32 Similarly, we did not pool crossover trials that had not employed sufficient washout period between the two treatment periods because of bias arising from carryover treatment effects. We planned not to meta- analyze observational studies because of the differences in adjustment for confounders and residual confounding. We used a DerSimonian and Laird random- effects model to generate pooled estimates of relative risk (RR) if an outcome was measured on a dichotomous scale, and weighted between - group mean difference (for end points and within group changes), if an outcome was measured on a continuous scale. 33 The measure of variability of the pooled estimates was a 95 percent confidence interval. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using Cochran's Q (=0.10) and the I2 statistic. All analyses were performed using Comprehensive Meta Analysis version 2.2.057 (New Jersey, USA); StatsDirect Ltd. StatsDirect statistical software ,132 and R: A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing, Foundation for Statistical Computing.133 When studies failed to report summary statistics (e.g., mean score, standard deviation, standard error), we calculated the needed parameter s if individual participant data were provided. If a study reported only a standard error of the mean response, we converted it into a standard deviation. Trials were not meta -analyzed if the mean and standard deviation could not be ascertained. Trials wit h obvious between-group baseline imbalance in a continuous outcome 22 were not pooled unless the mean change from baseline and corresponding standard deviation for the compared study groups were reported. We used the Peto odds ratio method when event rates we re less than1 percent.32 For studies with zero events in some arms or sparse data overall, we pooled using the fixed effects Mantel - Haenszel method without continuity correction.34 Studies with zero events in both arms we re excluded from meta- analysis.32 Outcome results were considered inconclusive when the pooled estimate or the single contributing study estimate had confidence intervals wide enough to incorporate both important benefit and harm (i.e., type II error suggesting underpowered studies unable to precisely conclude benefit, harm or no difference between treatments). When studies could not be pooled, for example when similar outcomes were reported in different statistical formats, or study results pointed in opposite directions, results we re also labelled as inconclusive. When inconc lusive results were associated with a gradable outcome, strength of evidence was deemed insufficient. Exploration of heterogeneity was planned to examine clinical and methodological diversity, to answer subquestion (a) of the four Key Question s by carrying out subgroup and sensitivity analyses, and/or meta- regression if there was a sufficient number of studies (4 studies for each categorical subgroup variable, and 6 to10 for a continuous subgroup variable). 32 This was not carried out because o f a paucity of studies for each outcome. Prespecified clinical subgroups included: gender (male, female), ethnicity (including Hispanic, Asian, African American, and Native American), age (those age 65 years and above, and 80 years and above), baseline hea lth status (healthy volunteers, participants according to coronary heart disease risk category, participants at risk for cardiovascular disease, participants with known cardiovascular disease, participants with diabetes, participants with hepatic or renal dysfunction or end-stage renal disease, participants taking a cardiovascular drug for an indication other than cardiovascular disease), and genotypic polymorphisms (e.g., in CYP2D6, 2C9, 2C19). Sensitivity analyses were to be conducted to explore whether the effect estimates of dietary supplement treatment were influenced by methodological variables such as overall study risk of bias, adequacy of participant selection, important confounding, blinding of outcome assessors, purity/dose/stability of a dietary supplement, or duration of treatment or followup. Statistical interaction was to be investigated for all four Key Question s. To determine measureable interactions between cardiovascular drugs and dietary supplements, we followed the procedures described below: If a study explicitly examined interaction between cardiovascular drug and dietary supplement, then we extracted the study's findings along with the method for assessing interaction. When studies did not investigate statistical interaction between th e dietary supplement plus cardiovascular drug group and the cardiovascular drug alone group, we carried out test for interactions when data for at least four groups were reported. These groups had to be supplement plus cardiovascular drug group, supplement alone group, cardiovascular drug alone group, and a common comparator placebo or no treatment group. For studies that presented dichotomous data we calculated the synergy index (S). 35 Synergy Index (S) = 1 - RR11 1-RR01RR10 Where RR 11 is the relative risk for subjects exposed to cardiovascular drug and dietary supplement, and RR 01 and RR 10 are the relative risks for subjects exposed to cardiovascular drug 23 alone and dietary supplement alone respectively. An S- index greater than 1 descri bes a positive interaction (synergism) and an S-index less than 1 indicates a negative interaction (antagonism).For continuous outcomes, individual patient data were needed to have been modeled in a linear regression with an interaction term. Definitions Pharmacokinetic Measurements: Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion . Adapted from Rowland and Tozer 1995134 Pharmacokinetics The study of the mechanisms of absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination of an administered drug in the living organism Absorption Absorption can refer to any route of administration except intravenous administration (i.e., enteral, subcutaneous, transdermal). 1. Fractional bioavailability (F) : the fraction of a non-intravenously administered dose of a drug that reaches the systemic circulation ( unit: percent) 2. Time to maximum concentration (t max): the time at which the maximum plasma concentration of a drug occurs following administration of an extravascular dose (unit: minute or hour) 3. Maximum concentration (C max): the highest drug concentration in plasma after an extravascular dose (unit: \u00b5g mL-1) 4. The area under the plasma drug concentration- time curve (AUC 0-t): the measure of an exposure of plasma to a drug over a given time period. It is calculated as the area under the serum concentration-time curve which is based on multiple drug concentration measurements at various time points (unit: \u00b5g mL -1hour) Distribution Volume of distribution (Vd) is the apparent volume into which a drug distributes in the body at equilibrium. Alternatively, it is the volume of plasma at the drug concentration required to account for the entire drug in the body (unit: L/kg) Volume is not limited to plasma. For example, volume of distribution will exceed plasma volume or total body water volume for highly lipophylic drugs. Metabolism/Excretion 1. Clearance: the volume of plasma in the vascular compartment cleared of drug per unit time by the processes of metabolism and excretion (unit: mL/hour) 2. The elimination half -life (t1/2): the time required to reduce the plasma concentration of a drug or the total amount of drug in the body to one half of its initial value (unit: hour) 24 Results Screening and I nclusion of Records Overall, 33,224 records were identified by searches of databases after removing all duplicates . The PRISMA diagram in Figure 2 depicts the flow of retrieved records through the phases of screening and inclusion. A total of 169 English publication studies were included after title/abstract, and full text screening. None of the 68 German publications screened at full text level met the eligibility criteria. Eighty-nine studies were subsequently excluded from the data synthes is for the following reasons: Proportion of population taking cardiovascular drugs was less than 80 percent, preventing accurate analysis of interaction of supplement and cardiovascular drug (n= 72); No outcome of interest was reported (n=6)135-140 Cardiovascular drug was not used in U.S.A. (n=4)141-144 Dose of supplement was not reported (n=1)145 Outcome data were reported only for the first period crossover (n=1)146 A sequential study was not included in synthesis of evidence because higher quality randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence was available for the same pharmacokinetic outcome, for the same drug-supplement combination (n=1) 147 No response was received to a data request made to authors (n=1)148 High quality systematic review was of li mited utility because it was out of date. Inclusion would have necessitated a de novo process for the included studies; (n=1)149 (In two separate records). Observational study reported outcomes where higher level of evidence was available from RCT for the same outcomes (n=1)150 As a result, 80 reports were included in the evidence synthesis of this review and entered the quality assessment and data extraction. Among these, seven studies were reported in more than one publication, amounting to 18 records (Table 9) . We identified one of these records as the primary report of the stud y and other(s) as a companion; however, relevant data from all related reports were used in the evidence syntheses. With this approach, 70 primary studies were included and are referenced accordingly in this review (Table 9). One of the included studies wa s observational, 88 two were controlled clinical trials,62,79 and the remaining 66 studies were RCTs. Twenty two RCT studies contributed to meta- analyses and the remaining were included in the qualitative syntheses of evidence.36,37,40,44,53,67,68,73,74,76,77,83 -86,91,93-96,151,152 We contacted authors of two records requesting additional data or seeking data clarification.39,148 One of the authors,39 responded to our query and provided additional data which was incorporated in the evidence syntheses.

In adults taking cardiovascular drugs, what are the effects of concomitant use of specific dietary supplements (when compared to cardiovascular drugs alone or cardiovascular drugs and a different dietary supplement[s]) on clinical cardiovascular effectiveness/efficacy outcomes (e.g., mortality and specific cardiovascu lar or cerebrovascular conditions such as myocardial infarction [MI] and stroke)? a. Do the effect estimates of clinical cardiovascular outcomes vary by age, ethnicity, gender, or health status? b. Is there a measurable interaction between cardiovascular drugs and dietary supplements for clinical cardiovascular outcomes? Overview Twenty-one RCTs addressed Key Question 1.36-56 No relevant data were available from observational studies. No evidence on clinical outcomes was found for Echinacea , garlic, ginger, ginseng, hawthorn, niacin (not more than 250 mg /day), red yeast rice extract, resveratrol, vitamin A, and vitamin D with or without calcium supplementation (Table 10). There was insufficient evidence for the gradable outcomes of hospitalization and those related to peripheral arterial disease across all supplement-cardiovascular drug(s) combinations, due to lack of data. A paucity of studies for each supplement- drug combination of interest precluded exploration of heterogeneity in terms of pre -identified subgroups (K ey Question 1a). No study examined any statistical interaction between supplement and drug on clinical outcomes (K ey Question1b). Table 11 summarizes characteristics of included studies and Table 12 summarizes their risks of bias. Below we report results separately for each supplement and cardiovascular drug combination, by outcomes for which evidence was available. We then grade the evidence for the prestated gradable outcomes, and summarize the PICOTS determinants of applicability for conclusive results across all outcomes\u2014that is, when results were not impacted by the possibility of type II error. In all analyses, the intervention was administration of a dietary supplement along with one or more cardiovascular drug or class of drugs, while the comparator was administration of the drug or its class alone. Details of individual study characteristics, risk of bias and outcomes data are reported in Appendix C. 27 Table 10.

These outcomes were reported in one crossover randomized placebo- controlled trial with a duration of 3 months, in 30, mostly male patients with left ventricular dysfunction, at a specialty center . Coenzyme Q10 (33 mg three times daily ) plus maximally tolerated doses of angiotensin -converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors was compared with ACE inhibitors alone. The m ajority of patients (i.e., greater than 80 percent) were also taking digoxin, furosemide, hydralazine and/or nitrates. A single death in the placebo group was noted.54 No significant differences were noted in quality of life scores using the Minnesota \"Living with Heart Failure\" questionnaire (mean sum of all scores posttreatment 26.7\u00b117.9 versus 26.5\u00b118.7). It is not clear whether the statistical analysis incorporated within patient differences in order to fully utilize the robustness of this crossover design.

Type II error could not be excluded. Abbreviations: ACE = angiotensin converting enzyme; NA = not applicable. Coenzyme Q10 Plus Statins Versus Statins Alone Adherence. A 12-week pilot study of limited internal validity ( unclear adequacy of sequence generation, allocation concealment and blinding) assessed adherence to statins. A select group of patients with moderate to high 10 year coronary heart disease ( CHD) risk and self reported statin associated myalgia were included. The trial did not demonstrate any difference in rates of adherence to simvastatin (10 mg/day to 40 mg/day) between add -on coenzyme Q10 (200 mg/day) and in previous statin related myalgia . Adherence to simvastatin was 98 percent in both groups , but it is not clear how adherence was assessed .38 Ginkgo Biloba Ginkgo Biloba Plus Antiplatelets Versus Antiplatelets Alone and neurologic recovery score. These outcomes with G.biloba extract (40 mg every six hours) were investigated over 4 weeks in 62 South Asian patients with previous ischemic stroke, who were on regular aspirin and/or pentoxphilline.48 Trial limitations included 30 unclear allocation concealment, attrition bias , and potential imbala nce between groups in terms of the nature of neurologic deficits. The trial was clearly underpowered and of too short duration to detect differences in all -cause mortality and neurologic improvement in the modified Mathew's scale. There were no deaths and no significant differences in neurologic recovery score after one month of treatment. The mean relative change from baseline in linear transformed Mathew's scale averaged approximately 20 in both groups, and showed improvement over time (mean difference (M D)) 0.81 [95 percent confidence interval ( CI) -9.12, 10.74]). 48 Strength of evidence is summarized in Table 14.

Oral Magnesium Magnesium Plus Beta -Blockers Versus Beta -Blockers Alone nfarction . A single event of myocardial infarction was observed in a randomized crossover controlled trial of oral magnesium aspartate (365 mg daily) or placebo administered daily for 8 weeks to a selected group of 40 hypertensive patients with no comorbidities, on therapeutic doses of beta- blockers. The trial was underpowered to detect differences in clinical outcomes and lacked a clear description of several risk of bias items.42 Strength of evidence is summarized in Table 15. Table 15.

These outcomes were assessed in five trials. Zero mortality in one randomized crossover pharmacokinetic study of omega-3 (80 mg/day) versus atorvastatin monotherapy, over 14 days in 50 healthy nonsmoking adults provided insufficient evidence.36 In another study, a single case of supraventricul ar tachycardia (in the add -on 4 g/day omega- 3 fatty acid g roup) in an 8 -week efficacy trial in 256 highly selected dyslipidemic patients on statin therapy constituted insufficient evidence for the arrhythmia outcome.40 There was also one case of exacerbation of congestive heart failure in the add -on omega-3 fatty acid group.40 31 Rates of adherence to statin therapy were reported in three efficacy trials of 6 to 12 weeks duration in highly selected patient populations with dyslipidemia with or without add-on 4 to 9 g/day of omega -3 fatty acids. All studies had unclear risk of bias for adequacy of sequence generation and allocation c oncealment. Adherence to statin therapy was judged by pill count. No differences in statin adherence rates were noted between both groups - across all three studies, adherence rates in the two groups were equal to or greater than 95 percent. 37,44,53 Strength of evidence is summarized in Table 16. Omega-3 Fatty Acids/Fish Oils Plus Cardiovascular Drugs Versus Cardiovascular Drugs Alone Mortality, myocardial infarction, cardiovascular procedures, restenosis, coronary vasospasm, and graft occlusion. These outcomes were assessed with various cardiovascular drugs. Insufficient evidence f rom single efficacy trials with sparse events did not demonstrate a difference in the outcome of all -cause mortality when study cardiovascular drugs were either aspirin (291 high risk patients followed for 1 year, with nine deaths), warfarin (319 high risk patients followed for 1 year with 5 deaths), or fenofibrate (unclear 10 year CHD risk in 167 participants with hypertriglyceridemia followed for 8 weeks with no deaths) (Table 16) . 47,56 In a 6 month effi cacy study of omega-3 fatty acids daily (1.8 g eicosapentaenoic acid plus 1.2 g docosahexaenoic acid) in addition to therapeutic doses of aspirin plus calcium channel antagonist versus the latter two drugs alone, six cases of acute myocardial infarction were identified among 58 patients who had undergone successful coronary angioplasty (relative risk [RR] 1.70 [95 percent CI 0.32, 8.84]) (Table 16). 51 The same study reported non- significant differences among 26 patients requiring subsequent angioplasty ( RR 1.35 [95 percent CI 0.68, 2.70]) and four who underwent coronary artery bypass graft (RR 0.84 [95 percent CI 0.12, 5.78]).51 Table 16.

Rates of restenosis were investig ated with coronary angiography three to four months following successful angioplasty, in 82 highly selected male patients. Although it was not an a priori outcome for this review , we are reporting restenosis because of its clinical relevance.52 Restenosis was defined as 50 percent narrowing of the luminal diameter . Outcome assessors were blinded to treatment allocation. In this randomized trial, patients were treated either with a daily dose of 3.2 grams of eicosapentaenoic acid added to therapeutic doses of the combination of aspirin, dipyridamole, and calcium channel antagonists, or the latter three drugs in combination. Significantly lower rates of restenosis were observed in the treatment group (RR 0.40 [95 percent CI 0.20, 0.82]); however, the mean percentage reduction in luminal diameter was not significantly different between the two groups. These results conflict with a similar trial conducted in India in 107 patients , that found no significant difference in rates of early restenosis (RR 1.33 [95 percent CI, 0.76, 2.30] ). 51 Restenosi s rates were not significantly influenced by gender or age (p greater than 0.05 for interaction).51 Possible explanation s for these differing trial results, besides differences in patient populations, include that in the Indian trial patients were not treated with dipyridamole , and in the same trial followup angiography was only conducted in those with angina symptoms or a positive exercise test (unlike the previous ly discussed trial that undertook foll owup angiography in all patients), thereby potentially biasing the results by excluding healthier individuals. Coronary vasospasm induced by intracoronary acetylcholine was studied in 22 Japanese patients with variant angina randomized to 4 months treatment with therapeutic doses of diltiazem plus eicosapentaenoic acid (1.8 g/day), or diltiazem alone . Patients served as their own controls. Acetylcholine induced vasoconstriction, measured as percentage change in post nitrate coronary artery diameter compared to the baseline response, was significantly improved in th ose receivingomega-3 fatty acids but not in the control group. 50 The report was unclear as to how the randomization sequence was generated, allocation was concealed, and outcome assessors were blinded. Based on the reported data, our comparative analysis of posttreatment percentage change in coronary artery diameter following intracoronary acetylcholine injection showed nonsignificant differences between supplement plus diltiazem and diltiazem alone groups (percentage mean difference in spastic segment was -1.3 [95 percent CI-10.34, 7.74)] and segments was [95 percent CI -4.56, 6.36]) Coronary bypass graft occlusion rates were evaluated after one year , in 610 participants on either aspirin (300 mg /day) or warfarin (target prothrombin International Normalized Ratio [INR] 2.5-4.2), in conjunction with placebo oromega-3 fatty acids (4 g/day) plus -tocopherol (15 mg/day) as an anti-oxidant. 47 Graft occlusion was predefined as visualization of the lack of contrast flow on followup angiography. An important limitation of this randomized trial was its lack of clear reporting of adequate allocation concealment. No significant differences in graft occlusion rates were noted , but studies were underpowered to detect a difference (Table 17). 33 Table 17.

Vitamin E ( -Tocopherol) Vitamin E Plus Cardiovascular Drug Versus Cardiovascular Drug Alone Stroke, transient ischemic attacks, adherence, angina, myocardial infarction, and vascular death . These outcomes were assessed in five trials. In an efficacy trial, 100 highly selected patients with previous reversible or irreversible ischemic neurologic deficit and good performance status presenting to a university hospital we re randomized to vitamin E (0.4 g/day) plus aspirin (325 mg /day) versus aspirin alone for a period of two years. Nine patients experienced outcomes of stroke (seven ischemic, two hemorrhagic), and three experienced recurrent transient ischemic attack, precluding definitive conclusions (Table 18).49 Table 18.

In one pragmatic trial in 19 ,934 women randomized to vitamin E (600 IU/day) plus aspirin (100 mg/day) versus aspirin alone for 10 years, no significant differences were noted for the composite outcome of nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, CI 0.79, 1.13]).39 Data regarding the tot al number of participants randomized 34 into the two groups were obtained from the authors. Although components of the composite outcome were gradable, it was not possible to discern if shifts in incidence of stroke and heart attack might have been obscured i n this composite outcome. Two trials, each of one month duration, in a total of 60 highly selected Japanese patients with variant angina, were inconclusive for the mean number of angina attacks per patient following addition of vitamin E (400 mg /day) to therapeutic doses of diltiazem (MD -0.40 [95 percent CI - 0.88, 0.08]) (Figure 3). 43,45 Figure 3.

Insufficient evidence was found for m ortality and stroke. One 6 month efficacy trial in 70 selected patients with unstable INRs, anticoagulated with warfarin, reported no stroke and one death.41 During the 6 month study period, two of 35 patients failed to take their warfarin and the supplement on a single occasion.41 Strength of evidence is summarized in Table 19.

Do the effect estimates of clinical cardiovascular outcomes vary by age, ethnicity, gender, or health status? A paucity of studies of supplement-drug combinations for which data were available precluded exploration of heterogeneity in terms of pre-identified subgroups. 35 Key Question 1b. Is there a measurable interaction between cardiovascular drugs and dietary supplements for clinical cardiovascular outcomes? No study analyzed statistical interaction between a supplement and a cardiovascular drug on clinical outcomes. Main Points for Key Question 1: Clinical Outcomes For Key Question 1, we compared dietary supplement(s) co administered with cardiovascular drug(s), with the cardiovascular drug(s) alone, to investigate comparative clinical efficacy/effectiveness, subgroup effect s and statistical interactions. Twenty-one randomized controlled trials contributed evidence. For all predetermined gradable clinical outcomes for which evidence was found, the strength of evidence of comparative efficacy or effectiveness was graded insufficient because type II error could not be ex cluded due to the low power of studies. When compared with the specific cardiovascular drug alone, insufficient evidence was found for an effect of c oenzyme Q10 co administered with ACE inhibitors on all- cause mortality and quality of life; Ginkgo biloba plus aspirin and/or pentoxyphilline on and infarction; omega- 3 all- mortality and arrhythmia; omega-3 fatty acids -cause mortality; omega-3 fatty acids aspirin and calcium channel antagonist on acute myocardial infarction; vitamin E plus aspirin on stroke and transient ischemic attacks; and vitamin K plus warfarin derivative on all -cause mortality and stroke. No differences in adherence to statins were noted with co administration of coenzyme Q10, omega-3 fatty acids, and vitamin E, with adherence rates greater than 90 percent in both drug plus supplement and drug alone groups. Evidence supporting benefit of omega - 3 fatty acids added to conventional antiplatelet therapy and calcium channel antagonists on rates of restenosis following successful coronary angioplasty is conflicting. Underpowered studies addressed all other outcomes such as exacerbation of congestive heart failure, number of patients undergoing cardiac procedures, graft occlusion, neurologic recovery score, coronary vasospasm, and number of angina attacks in patients with variant angina for various dietary supplement and cardiovascular drug combinations Most studies were short- term efficacy trials, except for one pragmatic trial on 19,934 women randomized to vitamin E (600 IU/day) plus aspirin (100 mg /day) versus aspirin alone for 10 years. In this trial, no significant difference was noted for the composite outcome of nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and vascular death (RR 0.95, 95 percent CI, 0.79, 1.13). With no data, there was insufficient evidence for the outcomes of hospitalization and those related to peripheral arterial disease acr oss all supplement- cardiovascular drug(s) combinations. No evidence on clinical outcomes was found for Echinacea , garlic, ginger, ginseng, hawthorn, niacin (not more than 250 mg /day), red yeast rice extract, resveratrol, vitamin A, and vitamin D (with or without calcium supplementation) coadministered with a cardiovascular drug(s) 36 A paucity of studies of supplement-drug combinations for which data were available precluded exploration of heterogeneity in terms of pre-identified subgroups, or documentation of any dose-response effect . No study analyzed statistical interaction between a supplement and a cardiovascular drug on clinical outcomes. Key Question 2 . In adults taking cardiovascular drugs, what are the effects of concomitant use of specific dietary s upplements (when compared to cardiovascular drugs alone or cardiovascular drugs and a different dietary supplement[s]) on intermediate cardiovascular efficacy outcomes (e.g., lipids, blood pressure, electrocardiographic measurements, serum markers, bleeding, and coagulation times)? a. Do the effect estimates of intermediate cardiovascular outcomes vary by age, ethnicity, gender, or health status? b. Is there a measurable interaction between cardiovascular drugs and dietary supplements for intermediate cardi ovascular outcomes? Overview Fifty-eight RCTs and one controlled clinical trial addressed Key Question 2. The availability of evidence is summarized in Table 20. The dietary supplements used in the studies were the following: coenzyme Q10 (five studies),38,54,57,58,89 biloba (five studies),64-68 ginseng studies),46,49,79- 87 and vitamin K ( one study)41. No evidence was identified for effects of red yeast rice extract, resveratrol, vitamin A, or vitamin D in combination with cardiovascular drugs on intermediate outcomes. No study addressed the following outcomes: incidence of metabolic syndrome; incidence of hypotension; carotid- intima media thickness; or change in 10 -year Framingham risk profile. T wo studies examined statistical interaction. 44,78 One study used general linear modeling to assess interaction between fish/marine oils and atorvastatin on lipid parameters.44 The other study used ANOVA to assess interaction between omega-3 fatty acids and niacin plus aspirin on triglyceride levels. 78 No relevant data were available from observational studies . One systematic review reporting the effectiveness of concomitant administration of omega-3 fatty acids plus statins compared with statins alone on lipid profiles in participants requiring lipid lowering therapy 149 was not included for synthesis because it was determined to be out of date.

Assessment of risks of bias is summarized in Table 22. Among all RCTs the purity of supplement was the item most frequently reported, while underreporting of generation and concealment of allocation represented the greatest potential for bias. In all crossover trials the study design was deemed to be suitable for the studied condition and a majority were judged to be free of carryover effect. Table 22.

The trials were conducted in Australia,38,54,58 North America,89 and East Asia.57 The number of included participants across these trials ranged from 3054 to 49,57 and they received statins (atorvastatin, simvastatin),38,57 fenofibrate ,58 ACE inhibitors (specific agents not stated ), or vitamin E89 in addition to other cardiovascular drugs (digoxin, furosemide, hydralazine, nitrates, or statins).54 According to the National Cholesterol Education Program, Adult Treatment Panel III,165 the study participants were categorized as having a high,54,58 unclear,57,89 or mixed (moderate and high)38 risk for CHD. The duration of treatment across the studies ranged from 4 89 to 12 weeks.38,54,57,58 Generally, these studies were reported to be double-blind and had moderate risk of bias across the outcomes of interest. The washout period in the one crossover trial was adequate to minimize or avoid a carryover treatment effect. 54 Further details on study, participant, and treatment characteristics are presented in Appendix C . Summary of findings and strength of evidence data are presented in Table 23. No meta- analysis was possible for coenzyme Q10 studies because when more than one study reported a particular outcome,38,57,89 the treatment effect was either not reported,89 or it was reported as a median (interquartile range) change,38 so the study results were in a format that is unsuitable for statistical pooling. Coenzyme Q10 Plus Statins Versus -arm examined changes participants with unclear CHD risk.57 The 12-week mean CRP levels were not different between groups with add-on dietary supplement treatment (100 mg/d ay) versus the statin -only (10 mg/day) parallel -arm randomized trials examined HDL -C changes in participants with unclear or mixed CHD risk. 38,57 In one trial, mean HDL-C levels after 12 weeks of treatment were not significantly different for those receiving coenzyme Q10 (100 mg /day) plus statins (10 mg/day) versus those receiving only statins.57 Similarly, in the second trial (200 mg/d ay coenzyme Q10 ; 10-40 mg/d ay statins), there was no significant between -group difference for the median change in HDL -C.38 41 Low density lipoprotein -cholesterol , total cholesterol and triglycerides . Two trials in participants with mixed38 or unclear CHD risk investigated changes in LDL -C.57 Levels were not significantly different following treatment with coenzyme Q10 plus statins compared with plus statins alone after 12 weeks.38,57 Mean differences 57 and between -group difference for the median change 38 were not significant for LDL-C, total cholesterol, or triglycerides. Coenzyme Q10 Plus Statins Versus Vitamin E Plus Statins Lipid profile, low density lipo protein -cholesterol , total cholesterol and triglycerides . In one trial of 32 participants with unclear CHD risk , changes of LDL- C, TC, and TG levels were studied.89 Results from this RCT indicated no differences in lipid profile (total cholesterol, LDL - C, triglycerides) after 30 days of treatment with coenzyme Q10 (100 mg /day) plus statins or vitamin E (400 IU/day) plus statin groups in participants with statin induced myopathic pain (numeric data were not provided). 89 Coenzyme Q10 Plus ACE Inhibitors Versus ACE Inhibitors Alone Participants were also taking digoxin, furosemide, hydralazine, and nitrates . Ejection fraction . One randomized crossover trial reported ejection fraction in participants with heart failure (high CHD risk ). 54 The 12 week post treatment ejection fraction in the treatment (coenzyme Q10 [100 mg /day] plus ACE inhibitors) and control (ACE inhibitors alone ) groups were not signifi cantly different . Coenzyme Fenofibrate Lipid profiles and systolic blood pressure . One parallel arm randomized trial in participants with type II diabetes and high CHD risk reported changes in systolic blood pressure.58 The 12 week posttreatment mean levels in the treatment (200 mg/day coenzyme Q10 plus 200 mg/d ay fenofibrate) and control (fenofibrate alone) groups did not significantly differ for any of the outcomes assessed (HDL-C, LDL-C, total cholesterol, triglycerides , non-HDL-C, and systolic blood pressure). Applicability . Low grade evidence of no effect on HDL -C was found in a primarily (70 percent) male population, of m ean age 53 years, with high risk for cardiovascular disease. Treatment was over 12 weeks, with fenofibrate and with or without coenzyme Q10. 42 Table 23.

Garlic Four RCTs, including three parallel- arm trials,60,62,63 and one crossover trial61 examined cardiovascular drugs with and without garlic. The trials were conducted in Australia,61 North America,60,63 and Europe.62 The number of included participants across these trials ranged from 1261 to 60,62 and they received statins plus aspirin ,63 warfarin,60,61 or nitrates.62 According to the National Cholesterol Education Program, Adult Treatment Panel III,165 the study participants were categorized as having a high,62,63 unclear,60 or low 61 CHD risk. The duration of treatment across the studies r anged from one day61 to 12 months.63 The washout period in the one crossover trial was adequate to minimize or avoid a carryover treatment effect. Further details on study, participant, and treatment characteristics are presented in Appendix C. Strength of evidence is summarized in Table 25. Garlic Plus Warfarin Versus Warfarin Alone Two small RCTs, one parallel -group60 and one crossover61 trial, examined the effect of treating patients on warfarin with garlic extracts. Both studies concluded that supplementation with garlic in patients taking warfarin does not further affect INR, based on various measures including INR,60 or INRmax, AUC of INR , or the number of participants with an INR greater than 4 (no events in either arm).61 One study60 in 48 participants with prosthetic heart valves, or diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis, valvular heart disease, or atrial fibrillation assessed the effect s of aged garlic extract 44 (AGE) (10 mL/d ay) plus warfarin. No significant effects were seen for total cholesterol, LDL-C, or triglycerides. However , there was a statistically significant increase in HDL -C in the combination group. Neither b lood pressure, nor platelet count (data not shown) were significantly affected . One crossover study61 found no significant effect of pretreatment with garlic (4 g single dose) plus a single dose of warfarin (25 mg ) on platelet aggregation (using adenoside diphosphate, arachidonic acid, collagen and ristocetin; data not presented). Participants in this trial were 16 healthy male adults of known CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotype. All results for major review outcomes, aside from HDL-C, were considered to have insufficient strength of evidence (Table 25 ).The strength of evidence for HDL -C was initially rated as insufficient by one reviewer because the lower bound confidence interval of 0.19 mg /dL is not clinically meaningful. A second reviewer provided a rating of low because the estimate is statistically significant. Adjudication by a third reviewer led to a final rating of low. Garlic Plus Nitrates Versus Nitrates Alone One controlled clinical trial62 recruited 60 participants with coronary artery disease to receive either garlic oil ( 4 g/day) or placebo in addition to their prescribed nitrates (specific drugs and doses were not reported). Compared with placebo, administration of garlic was found to significantly decrease total serum cholesterol , and increase serum HDL -C.62 Serum triglycerides were also reduced but the comparison was not statistically significant. These results were considered to provide insufficient strength of evidence for triglycerides and low strength of evidence for HDL -C in favor of combination treatment (Table 25). Garlic Plus Statins and Aspirin Versus Statins and Aspirin Alone One small parallel group trial63 randomly allocated 23 participants with, or at high risk for coronary artery disease to receive AGE (4 mL ,305 g/L of extracted solids /day) or placebo in addition to their prescribed statins (10-40 mg/d ay) and aspirin (dose not specified) over a period of one year. Compared with placebo, administration of AGE was not found to have a significant effect on lipid parameters (total cholesterol (TC), TC/HDL -C, HDL-C, LDL-C, triglycerides), CRP, or platelet count. This study also examined two m easures of coronary artery calcification: volume calcium score (using i sotropic interpolation method) and Agatston calcium score ( multiplying the lesion area by a coefficient based on the peak density within plaque). The first measure was found to be lowered significantly by supplementation with garlic compared with placebo ( change in volume calcium score: -83.80 mm3 [95 percent CI -164.22, -3.38] ; volume calcium score per year: -14.7 mm3 [95 percent CI -28.93, -0.47]). No differences were found in the second measure. Strength of evidence was insufficient for LDL- C, HDL-C, and triglycerides ( Table 25). 45 Table 25 .

Garlic in addition to nitrates for 3 months was found to significantly improve total cholesterol and HDL-C compared with nitrates alone, in subjects with healed myocardial infarction with or without angina.62 Garlic in addition to statins plus aspirin for 12 months significantly lowered a measure of coronary artery calcification in subjects with known coronary artery disease.63 Ginger One crossover RCT compared a single dose of warfarin following seven days pre-treatment with ginger (3.6 g/day) with warfarin alone in 12 healthy male subjects ( Table 26).64 The study also included a warfarin plus G. biloba group (data for the comparison between warfarin plus ginger and warfarin plus Ginkgo is in the G. biloba section). The same study reported AUC of INR for the combination of ginger plus warfarin versus warfarin alone. 64 One of the two analyses of the data suggests a possible effect of unknown clinical significance. The mean difference in platelet aggregation was not statistically significant (MD 0.6 [95 percent CI -0.42, 1.62]) but the geometric mean ratio was statistically significant . Given the inconsistency in findings, s trength of evidence was graded a s insufficient for INR (Table 26 ). Table 26 .

One study included subjects taking an antic oagulant (warfarin64) and one study included subjects taking a (cilosta zol67). G. Biloba Plus Antiplatelet Agents Versus Antiplatelet Agents Alone Aspirin was administered with G. biloba in two studies, of young healthy males (240 mg /day G. biloba)65 or elderly subjects with peripheral arterial disease or risk factors for cardiovascular disease (300 mg/day G. biloba).66 Although platelet aggregation was reported in both studies, meta-analysis could not be performed because different post treatment effect estimates were reported (mean65 and mean change from baseline66). Both studies reported nonsignificant differences in platelet aggregation. N onsignificant differences were also reported in clotting time,66 bleeding time ,65 partial thromboplastin time,65 and platelet count.65 No changes were found in lipid parameters and blood pressure (reported qualitatively only).65 In two studies, single doses of a thienopyridine antiplatelet drug (clopidogrel67 or ticlopidine68) were administered with or without single doses of G. biloba( 80 mg/day). The pooled estimates for platelet aggregation were statistically nonsignificant ( Figures 4 and 5) , as was the pooled estimate for bleeding time ( Figure 6). There were no significant changes in clotting time, systolic blood pressure, or platelet count (reported qualitatively only).67 Strength of evidence was insufficient for blood pressure and lipid pr ofile (Table 27 ).

Biloba Plus Warfarin Versus Warfarin Alone One crossover RCT examined single dose warfarin (25 mg/day) following either no pretreatment or seven days pretreatment with G. biloba (12 g/day) or ginger (3.6 g/day ) in healthy subjects .64 Compared with warfarin alone, there was a statistically significant increase in platelet aggregation (GMR 1.14 [90 percent CI 1.08, 1.20] ). However, the difference in AUC of INR was not statistically significant. Compared with warfarin plus ginger, there were no statistically significant differences in platelet aggregation or AUC of INR . Strength of evidence G. biloba plus warfarin with warfarin alone or warfarin plus ginger was insufficient for INR (Table 27). G. Biloba Plus Cilostazol Versus Cilostazol Alone One crossover RCT examined single dose cilostazol (100 mg ) with or without single dose G. biloba (120 mg ) in healthy South Asian males.67 Bleeding time was slightly prolonged in the G. biloba plus cilostazol group.

Hawthorn In a randomized crossover trial, subjects were administered digoxin 0.25 mg /day for 10 days or digoxin 0.25 mg /day plus hawthorn 450 mg twice daily for 3 weeks .72 Subjects were tested with a standard 12- lead electrocardiogram for PR interval measurements. The difference between groups was statistically nonsignificant. Magnesium Three RCTs investigated the use of oral plus hydrochlorothiazide 73,74 and magnesium plus beta- adrenergic antagonists .42 Reported outcomes included total cholesterol, triglycerides, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure. 51 Magnesium Plus Hydrochlorothiazide Versus Hydrochlorothiazide Alone In an eight week trial of 18 elderly subjects with benign essential hypertension taking magnesium ( 365 mg/day), nonsignificant differences were found in total triglycerides, and supine systolic and diastolic blood pressure.73 Nonsignificant differences for systolic and diastolic blood pressure (supine and standing) were also reported in a seven week trial using magnesium (365 mg /day) in 21 subjects with mild to severe uncomplicated essential hypertension.74 These two studies were meta -analyzed for supine systolic and diastolic blood pressure and the pooled estimates were statistically nonsignificant (Figures 7 and 8).73,74 Strength of evidence was graded as insufficient for systolic and diastolic blood pressure and triglyceride level (Table 29).

Niacin (Not More Than 250 mg) One parallel -arm RCT described the use of niacin with propranolol in 16 subjects with Type II or Type IV hyperlipoproteinemia (Table 30).75 This study was rated as high risk of bias because groups were administered different dosages of propranolol (20 mg and 60 mg ). Effect estimates for total cholesterol and triglycerides were statistically nonsignif icant. Strength of evidence was insufficient for triglycerides (Table 30). 53 Table 30.

Generally, most of these studies were reported to be double blind and had a moderate risk of bias across the outcomes of interest. In crossover trials, the adequacy of washout period was not clear for one trial,37 there was a potential of carryover in one trial (i.e., the treatment effect depended on the order of drug randomization),99 and no washout period was employed for another trial.164 The washout period length reported for three other trials was deemed to be adequate.95-97 Summary of findings and strength of evidence data are presented in Table 31. Meta-analyses were performed for the following outcome measures : HDL-C, LDL-C, total cholesterol, and triglycerides (Figures 9 to 14). Omega-3 Fatty Acids/Fish Oils Plus Statins Versus Statins (CRP ) was assessed in one placebo- controlled parallel arm randomized trial in participants at mixed CHD risk.44 The six week posttreatment geometric mean CRP levels were not different between the omega-3 fatty acids (4 g/day) plus atorvastatin and in 37,40,44,53,91,92,94,96,97,151,163 In five studies,44,53,96,151,163 the mean endpoint differences in HDL - 54 C levels for participants with unclear or mixed CHD risk were not significantly different be tween the omega-3 fatty acids (2 to 10 g/day) combination and statins alone group. In one trial of participants at moderate CHD risk,40 the eight week posttreatment mean HDL -C level was significantly greater in the dietary supplement versus control group (MD 5.10 [95 percent CI 2.36, 7.83] ). A meta-analysis based on the results from seven studies (participants with unclear or mixed CHD risk),40,44,53,91,96,151,163 indicated that the mean HDL -C levels did not differ between the omega-3 fatty acids (2.0 to 10.0 g/day) combination and statins alone group (Figure 9). Results from the remaining four trials reporting mean change,92 percent change,97 or percent median change37,94 were not consistent. Specifically, one trial of participants with mixed CHD risk reported a significant difference in the five week posttreatment mean change in favor of the omega-3 fatty acids (2 g/day) combination (difference in mean change 2.32 [95 percent CI 0.18, 4.45]).92 Similarly, two other trials of participants with unclear94 and mixed37 CHD risk reported significantly greater ( i.e., improved) post treatment percent increase in median HDL -C levels at 6 weeks (difference7.2 percent, p 0.001),37 at eight weeks (difference of 2.4 percent, p less than 0.001)94 or at 16 weeks (difference of 6.3 percent, p less than 0.001)94 in favor of the die tary supplement intervention (4 g/day). In contrast, the percent change in HDL- C (from baseline) in one crossover trial of participants with mixed CHD risk was not significantly different betw een the dietary supplement ( 4 g/day) and control group at six weeks after the baseline (6.0 per cent versus 14.0 percent).97 Overall, results indicated no difference in posttreatment HDL -C levels between the dietary supplement and control interventions (Table 31). Figure 9. Posttreatment HDL-C levels in subjects taking statins with or without omega -3 fatty acids/fish oils (mg/dL) 55 Low density lipoprotein -C. Posttreatment levels of levels of LDL -C were reported in 10 randomized trials.37,40,44,53,91,92,94,96,97,151 In six trials,40,44,53,91,96,151 the mean endpoint differences in LDL-C levels for participants with unclear or mixed CHD risk were not significantly different between the dietary supplement (2.0 to 9.2 g/day ) and the control groups. Likewise, one trial found no significant difference in the mean change be tween the dietary supplement (2 g/day) and control groups (difference in mean change -5.84 mg/dL [95 percent CI -16.88, 5.20]).92 Our meta-analysis based on the results from 6 studies (participants with unclear or mixed CHD risk),40,44,53,91,96,151 indicated that the mean LDL -C levels did not differ between the intervention (2.0 to 9.2 g/day) and control groups (Figure 10). Two other trials of participants with unclear94 and mixed37 CHD risk reported that there was no significant difference in either posttreatment percent change in least squares mean (difference of 1.30 percent, p 0.43)37 or percent change in median (difference at 8 weeks 2.2 percent, p 0.24; at 16 weeks 0.3 percent, p 0.64)94 in LDL-C levels for the supplement( 4 g/day) versus control groups. The percent change in LDL -C (from baseline) in one crossover trial of participants at low CHD risk was not significantly different between the dietary supplement (6 g/day) and control group at six weeks (-39.0 percent versus -37.0 percent, p greater than 0.05).97 Figure10. Posttreatment LDL-C levels in subjects taking statins with or without omega -3 fatty acids/fish oils (mg/dL) Total c holesterol . Posttreatment levels of TC were reported for 11 trials.37,40,44,53,76,91,92,94,96,97,151 The pooled results based on our meta- analysis of six trials in participants with unclear or mixed CHD risk 40,44,53,91,96,151 showed that the mean total cholesterol levels did not differ significantly between the intervention (2 to 9 g/day) and control groups (Figure 11; pooled mean difference: - 3.86 [95 percent CI -10.69, 2.97]) 56 In two other trials,76,92 the mean endpoint/mean change differences in total cholesterol levels for participants with unclear or mixed CHD risk were not significantly different between the dietary supplement and the control groups. Similarly, one crossover trial97 using 6 g /day omega-3 fatty acids did not find a significant difference for mixed CH D risk participants in the post treatment total cholesterol percent change from baseline be tween the two treatment groups ( -31.0 versus -27.0, p greater than 0.05). In one trial of participants with unclear CHD risk,40 the 8 week posttreatment mean total cholesterol level was significantly improved in the dietary supplement ( 4 g/day) versus control group (mean difference: -9.60 [95 percent CI -17.05, -2.14]). Two other trials reported significantly greater reduction s in median total cholesterol percent change from baseline in the dietary supplement versus control groups for participants with mixed and unclear CHD risk (median percent change -2.7, p 0.006 37 and -5.8, p value less than 0.00194). One trial in participants with mixed CHD risk did not report numerical data.76 The wide confidence intervals around the pooled estimate rendered the results regarding posttreatment total cholesterol levels as inconclusive (Table 31). Figure 1. Posttreatment total cholesterol levels in subjects taking statins with or without omega -3 fatty acids/fish oils (mg/dL) Triglycerides . Posttreatment levels of TG were reported for 12 trials which included participants with unclear or mixed CHD risk .37,40,44,53,76,91,92,94,96,97,151,163 Initial pooling of six t rials reporting posttreatment mean triglyceride levels revealed some 63.53 percent; Chi-squared statistic 15.95; p 0.01).40,44,53,76,96,151 After careful examination of the study factors that could potentially explain this heterogeneity, we found that in two studies40,76 which were conducted in specialty clinics, 57 the participants' baseline triglycerides levels were on a verage higher than those in other studies, thereby resulting in a greater magnitude of the observed mean differences in favor of the dietary supplement intervention (-73.50 mg/dL40 and -91.23 mg/dL76). The meta-analysis of the two studies in participants with higher baseline levels of TG (greater than 200 mg/dL) resulted in a significant pooled estimate of mean difference in favor of adding the supplement to statins (I2 0 percent, Chi-squa red statistic 0.21) (Table 31). The meta-analysis based the remaining four studies in participants with lowe r baseline levels of TG (less than 200 mg /dL) showed a non- significant pooled mean difference (Figure 12) with no significant heterogeneity (I2 0 percent; Chi-squared statistic 0.08; p 0.99).44,53,96,151 acid supplements ranged from 4 to 9.2 g/day, and participants were at mixed (moderate/moderately high44, or low/moderate /high96) or unclear CHD risk. Information on clinical settings for these studies was not reported. Three trials reporting median37,94 or mean97 percent change from baseline in triglyceride levels showed significantly reduced (i.e., improved) levels for the dietary supplement versus control groups of participants with mixed (low/moderate/high) CHD risk, using omega -3 fatty acids (4 to 6 g/day) 37,97 or unclear CHD risk , using omega- 3 fatty acids (4 g/day).94 In contrast 4 month posttreatment median triglyceride levels were numerically similar between omega -3 fatty acids (2 g/day) plus statins versus statin alo ne group in participants with type II diabetes (97.4 mg/dL versus 106.2 mg /dL, p value was not reported) in one trial.91 The wide confidence intervals around the pooled estimate rendered the results with regards to posttreatment triglyceride levels between the dietary supplement and control interventions as inconclusive (Table 31). Figure 12. Posttreatment triglyceride levels in subjects taking statins with or without omega -3 fatty acids /fish oils (mg/dL) Non-HDL -C.Posttreatment levels of non- HDL-C were reported for five trials, in which participants had mixed or unclear CHD risk . 37,40,44,94,163 Dose of supplements used were 4 g/day in three trials,37,40,44,94 and 7.2 g/day in one trial.163 Of three trials reporting mean non- HDL-C levels,40,44,163 one trial in 254 participants with unclear CHD risk40 indicated significantly lower (i.e., improved) post treatment mean non- HDL-C in the dietary supplement group compared with the control group, whereas the remaining two trials (44 participants in both trials ) showed no 58 significant between -group mean difference.44,163 The pooling of results from the three trials40,44,163 revealed statistical heterogeneity across the effect estimates (I2 58.86 percent; Chi- squared statistic 4.96; p 0.08). There was no obvious explanation for this heterogeneity ; the participants across these trials were of either unclear or mixed CHD risk. These studies were not pooled. Trials reporting median percent change from baseline in non-HDL-C levels showed significantly greater (i.e., improved) reduction in non- HDL-C favoring the dietary supplement groups over the control groups in participants with unclear CHD risk94 and mixed CHD risk.37 The overall results regarding post treatment non-HDL-C levels between the treatment groups were determined to be inconclusive (Table 31). TC/HDL -C ratio. Posttreatment levels of the TC/HDL -C ratio were reported for four trials.37,40,94,163 Doses of supplement in these trials ranged from 4 to 7.2 g/day. Two trials in participants with unclear CHD risk 40,163 reporting post treatment mean TC/HDL ratio levels yielded discrepant results, one in favor of the dietary supplement group,40 and the other in favor of neither group.163 This discrepancy in the results for TC/HDL-C ratio may have been due to differences between participants' CHD risk across the studies. Based on the differences in CHD risk and the different directions of the effect estimates, it was decided not to pool these studies. Two other trials in participants with mixed37 or unclear CHD risk94 reported significant differences in post treatment percent change in least squares mean37 or percent change in median at eight weeks94 in the TC/HDL -C ratio, favoring the dietary supplement over the control intervention. The overall results regarding differences in posttreatment TC/HDL -C ratio levels between the treatment groups were inconcl usive (Table 31). Predefined thresholds of LDL -C and non- HDL -C. The proportion of participants reaching these thresholds was reported for one 16 week, parallel arm trial in participants with unclear CHD risk .94 At the end of the treatment, there was no difference in the proportion of participants reaching pre- defined targets of either LDL -C (below 160, 130, or 100 mg/d L, or HDL -C (below 190, 160, or 130 mg/dL ) between the supplement intervention ( omega-3 fatty acids 4 g/day) and control groups . Lipoprotein A . Posttreatment levels of lipoprotein A were reported for one trial. 96 In this crossover randomized trial, participants with familial hypercholesterolemia (mixed CHD risk) were treated over 4 weeks, for each treatment period. The difference in the 4 week post treatment mean lipoprotein A levels between the omega- 3 fatty acids (5.1 g/day) and control groups was not significant (Table 31). Blood p ressure. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels posttreatment were reported for four trials; three parallel arm91,92,151 and one crossover37 trial. In the first parallel arm trial92 participants with mixed CHD risk receiving omega-3 fatty acids (2 g/day) combined with statins (10 mg/day) for five weeks experienced significantly greater reductions in mean systolic blood pressure but not in diastolic blood pressure, compared with participants receiving statins alone. In two parallel arm trials with a treatment period of 1691 and 25 week s151 in participants with unclear CHD risk there was no significant d ifference in the blood pressure between the omega -3 59 fatty acids (2 g/day in one trial, and 4 or 8 g/day in the other trial) in combination with statins versus statins alone. Statistical test results for the comparison w ere not provided. In one crossover trial,37 participants with mixed CHD risk receiving omega-3 fatty acids (4 g/day) and statins (20 mg /day) experienced significantly greater median reductions from baseline in systolic and diastolic blood pressure compared with those receiving the control intervention. We were unable to perform a meta- analysis given the lack of data151 and the differences in effect measures, reported as reductions in median37 and mean levels.92 The overall results showed lower posttreatment systolic blood pressure levels for the combination of omega- 3 fatty acids and statins versus statins alone group (Table 31). Blood coagulation. This outcome was reported for a crossover randomized trial in healthy participants. 95 After 2 weeks of treatment, there was no difference between the groups of omega-3 fatty acids (4 g/day) in com bination with statins (80 mg/day) versus statins alone in the blood count was reported for three trials; one parallel arm76 and two crossover trials.95,97 Study participants in these trials had mixed CHD risk (healthy volunteers, and participants with combined or familial h yperlipidemia). The differences between posttreatment mean change76,95 or percent change 97 in platelet counts between baseline and two to six weeks between the omega-3 fatty acids (4 to 6 g/day) and control groups was not significant. Two trials76,95 reporting post treatment mean change in platelet count were not pooled because standard deviations were not reported for one study.95 Bleeding t ime. Posttreatment bleeding time was reported for a crossover randomized trial that included participants with mixed CHD risk (familial hyperlipidemia) . 97 There was no difference in percent change for bleeding time between the omega- 3 fatty acids (6 g/day) and the control groups following 6 weeks of treatment . Omega-3 Fatty Ac ids/Fish Oils Plus ACE Inhibitors Versus ACE Inhibitors Alone Triglycerides . Posttreatment levels were reported for two parallel arm trials in participants with unclear CHD risk (Table 31).77,152 In a 25 week trial 77 the difference in mean triglyceride levels between the omega-3 fatty acids (5 g/day) and control groups was not significant. In contrast, in a 6 week trial152 the mean triglyceride reduction signific antly favored the supplement (3 g /day) over the control group.152 These trials were not pooled due to differences in the reported effect measures. The overall results regarding post treatment triglyceride levels between the treatment groups were inconclusive. Blood Pressure. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels posttreatment were reported for two parallel arm trials in participants with unclear CHD risk , with supplementation with omega -3 fatty acids (3 to 5 g/day) 77,152 There was no significant between -group difference in either systolic blood pressure (mean difference 0 mm Hg77 and -1.00 mm Hg152) or diastolic blood pressure ( -1.40 mm Hg 77 and -2.00 mm Hg152). 60 The pooled analysis of these trials77,152 indicated that there was no difference in either systolic (Figure 13) or diastolic (Figure 14) blood pressure between the intervention and control groups. Figure 13. Posttreatment systolic blood pressure in subjects taking ACE inhibitors with or without omega-3 fatty acids/fish oils (mmHg) Figure 14. Posttreatment diastolic blood pressure in subjects taking ACE inhibitors with or without omega -3 fatty acids/fish oils (mmHg) Urinary p rotein . Posttreatment data excretion, and at least 50 percent reduction in proteinuria) was reported for one 25 week parallel arm trial in participants with unclear CHD risk.77 The participants in the omega- 3 fatty acids (3 g/day) plus ACE inhibitors (10 mg /day ramipril plus 300 mg /day irbersartan) combination group had significantly reduced (i.e., improved) mean urinary protein excretion compared with participants in the ACE inhibitor alone (367 mg/day versus 1353 mg /day). Similarly, the proportion of participants who achieved at least 50 percent reduction in proteinuria was significantly greater (i.e., improved) in the supplement versus control group (80 percent versus 20 percent). 61 Omega-3 Fatt y Acids/Fish Oils Plus Fenofibrate Versus Fenofibrate Alone One study56 contributed evidence (Table 31) . This was a parallel arm double blind placebo- controlled tria l in 167 participants in whom the treatment allocation concealment was unclear (moderate risk of bias). Participants had unclear CHD risk and received treatment for eight weeks (4 g/day omega -3 fatty acids plus 130 mg /day fenofibrate versus 4 g/day placebo plus 130 mg/day fenofibrate). The percent change from baseline to week 8 was not significantly different between participants in the dietary supplement and control groups for HDL -C, total cholesterol /HDL-C ratio), total cholesterol, non- HDL-C, or triglyce rides. In contrast, the percent change (i.e., reduction) from baseline in LDL- C levels was significantly greater in the dietary supplement versus control group. The incidence of hypertension was not significantly different between the two groups. The overa ll results of this study on levels of LDL-C, HDL -C, TC/HDL -C ratio, total cholesterol , and non- HDL-C median percent change ) were inconclusive. Omega-3 Fatty Acids/Fish Oils Plus Calcium Channel Blockers Versus Calcium Channel Blockers Alone One study50 contributed evidence (Table 31) . This 16 week parallel arm open label active treatment controlled trial was in 22 participants at high CHD risk (variant angina). T he supplement treatment (1. 8 g/day omega-3 fatty acids plus 90 to 120 mg/day diltiazem versus diltiazem) allocation concealment was unclear (moderate risk of bias) . The post treatment mean difference in total cholestero l, LDL-C, HDL-C, and triglycerides were not significantly different between participants in the dietary supplement and control groups. Due to wide confidence intervals, these results were inconclusive. Omega-3 Fatty Acids/Fish Oils Plus Aspirin and Calcium Channel Blockers Versus Aspirin and Calcium Channel Blockers Alone One study51 contributed evidence (Table 31) . This parallel arm single -blind (only assessors were blinded) active treatment (calcium channel blockers plus aspirin) controlled trial was in 107 participants for whom the randomization sequence was computer- generated and treatment allocation concealment was unclear (moderate risk of bias). Participants in this trial were at high CHD risk (pre -coronary angioplasty) and received their treatment for 6 weeks ( 3 g/day omega-3 plus calcium channel blockers and 150 mg /day aspirin versus calcium channel blockers and aspirin). The post treatment mean triglycerides was significantly lower ( i.e., improved) in the participants receiving the dietary supplement versus controls. The mean differences in total cholesterol , HDL-C, and LDL -C were not significantly different between the dietary supplement and control groups. The wide confidence intervals around these estimates rendered these results inconclusive (grade: insufficient). Omega-3 Fatty Acids/Fish Oils Plus Calcium Channel Blockers, Aspirin, and Dipyrida mole Versus Calcium Channel Blockers, Aspirin, and Dipyridamole One study52 contributed evidence (Table 31) . This para llel arm single -blind controlled trial was in 82 male participants for whom the randomization sequence was computer- generated and treatment allocation concealment was unclear (moderate risk of bias). All men in this trial were 62 at high CHD risk (post coronary angioplasty) and received their treatment for 12 weeks (3.2 g/day omega-3 plus calcium channel blockers,325 mg /day aspirin and 225 mg/day dipyridamole versus calcium channel blockers, aspirin and dipyridamole ). Although the post treatment mean LDL-C was significantly greater (i.e., worsened) in the participants receiving the dietary supplement versus controls, the mean triglyceride levels were significantly lower (i.e., improved) in the dietary supplement versus the control group. HDL -C, total cholesterol, and platelet count were not significantly different. The wide confidence intervals around these estimates rendered these results inconclusive (grade: insufficient). Omega-3 Fatty Acids/Fish Oils Plus Niacin (More Than 250 mg), and Aspirin Versus Niacin (More Than 250 mg), and Aspirin One study78 contributed evidence (Table 31) . This parallel arm placebo controlled active treatment (niacin plus aspirin) trial was in 14 participants for whom the randomization sequence and treatment allocation concealment were unclear (moderate risk of bias). The participants in this trial had unclear CHD risk (ath erogenic dyslipidemia) and received their treatment for 12 weeks (4 g/day omega-3 plus 500 to 3000 mg /day niacin plus 325 mg /day aspirin versus niacin and aspirin). The posttreatment mean differences in total cholesterol, HDL -C, LDL-C and triglycerides were not significantly different between the dietary supplement and control groups. Omega-3 Fatty Acids/Fish Oils Plus Aspirin Versus Aspirin Alone In two trials in healthy participants with low or mixed CHD risk , a single dose of aspirin (325 mg99 or 100 mg98) was administered following two to three weeks of omega- 3 fatty acids (8 to 10 g/day ) or placebo pre- treatment. Omega-3 Fatty Acids/Fish Beta -Adrenergic Antagonists A ntagonists Blood Pressure. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure change post treatment was reported for one trial.164 This double-blind crossover trial was in 25 participants with unclear CHD risk, on beta- blocker monotherapy who were randomized to receive omega- 3 fatty acids ( 4 g/day) or placebo for 6 weeks. No washout period was reported for this trial. The data for this study were not reported clearly, which precluded meaningful synthesis of the evidence. Omega-3 Fatty Acids/Fish Oils Plus Warfarin Versus Warfarin Alone One 4 week study55 contributed evidence. This was a parallel double blind (blinding status of participants, care providers, or study assessors was unclear), placebo- controlled trial in 11 participants with unclear CHD risk, for whom the randomization sequence and treatment allocation concealment were unclear (high risk of bias - there was a baseline between -group imbalance in gender and age).

Statin combinations were examined in populations with 22 to 100 percent males, with unclear to mixed CHD risk, and mean age ranging from 30 years to 63 years. ACE inhibitors were examined in populations with 40 to 85 percent males, with unclear or high CHD 67 risk, and mean age 40 years to 60 years. Calcium channel blockers plus aspirin plus dipyridamole were examined in a male population, with high CHD risk, and mean age 56 years. Trial duration ranged from 4 to 25 w eeks. Vitamin E Ten RCTs and one controlled clinical trial examined the use of Vitamin E with cardiovascular drugs. Subjects were concomitantly taking antiplatelet agents (aspirin or ticlopidine)49,80, furosemide 81, gemfibrozil79, nifedipine82, or statins.46,83-87 Vitamin E Plus Agents Versus Antiplatelet Agents Alone Two parallel -arm RCTs examined the effect of concomitant use of vitamin E and antiplatelet agents.49,80 In comparison with no treatm ent, 6 weeks of treatment with vitamin E (400 to 450 IU/day) was not found to effect total cholesterol in atherosclerotic plaque in 16 participants with high CHD risk taking aspirin or ticlop idine80. No changes in serum total choleste rol and triglyceride levels at followup were noted (reported qualitatively only). These results were potentially impacted by Type II error due to small sample size. Platelet aggregation was assessed in a trial comparing v itamin E (400 IU/day ) plus aspirin with aspirin alone in elderly, primarily white, subjects with transient ischemic attack , minor stroke, or residual neurologic deficits (unclear CHD risk). 49 Treatment was administered for 2 years. Platelet adhesion to collagen III was significantly decreased by v itamin E supplementation. Strength of evidence was insufficient for triglycerides (Table 32). Vitamin E Plus Furosemide Versus Furosemide Alone One small parallel -arm RCT of 24 participants examined the concomitant use of Vi tamin E and furosemide.81 Participants were randomized to receive either Vitamin E (600 mg/day) and furosemide (25 mg /day) or furosemide (25 mg /day) with placebo for 4 weeks. No signific ant differences were found in systolic and diastolic blood pressure. S trength of evidence for blood pressure was insufficient (Table 32 ). Vitamin E Plus Nifedipine Versus Nifedipine Alone One small crossover RCT in 30 participants at high CHD risk examined vitamin E (900 mg/day) plus nifedipine versus placebo plus nifedipine.82 Nifedipine long- acting formulation (average dose 88 plus/minus 11 mg /day) and Vitamin E were administered for four months. Supplementation with Vitamin E was found to significantly lower total serum cholestero l, LDL-C, and triglycerides . HDL-C was slightly r aised by administration of vitamin E, but the estimate was not statistically significant. There were no statistically significant differences in systolic and diastolic blood pressure. The strength of evidence was insufficient for systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and HDL- C. Strength of evidence for improvement in LDL- C and triglyceride levels with combina tion treatment was low (Table 32 ). Applicability. This study recruited elderly (mean age 73.8 plus/minus2.1 y ears), moderately obese subjects with stable effort angina and high CHD risk. 68 Vitamin E Plus Gemfibrozil Versus Gemfibrozil Alone The combination of vitamin E (600 mg /day) and gemfibrozil was assessed in one controlled clinical trial in 67 participants.79 Subjects were hyperlipidemic and were divided into young (mean age 29.5 plus/minus 4.9 years) and elderly (mean age 71.5 plus/minus 3.6 years) groups. No statistically significant effects were observed in lipid parameters or blood pressure. Effect estimates had very wide 95 percent confidence intervals, so this study was underpowered to detect statistically significant results. Strength of evidence for blood pressure and lipid parameters was insufficient (Table 32 ). Vitamin E Plus Statins Versus Statins A lone Six RCTs addressed combined use of vitamin E (400 to 1000 U/day ) and statins, including atorvastatin87, simvastatin83-86, and pravastatin46. All studies included subjects with hypercholesterolemia. In some studies, subjects also had additional conditions, such as diabetes87 and vascular disease.86 Lipid parameters were reported in all studies. Meta-analyses of total cholesterol, LDL -C, HDL-C, and triglycerides were undertaken for four trials.83-86 Two trials could not be meta- analyzed because different effect estimates were reported ( i.e., one trial reported serum lipid parameters in a qualitative manner only87 and one trial reported lipid parameters as percent change from baseline46). One study reported nonsignificant differences in cholesterol and triglyceride levels in non- HDL subfraction for combination vitamin E plus atorvastatin.87 Another study reported nonsignificant differences for percent change in baseline for total cholesterol, LDL -C, HDL-C, and triglycerides for combination vitamin E plus pravastatin.46 The four trials that were pooled involved administration of vitamin E with simvastatin (total sample size 106).83-86 Dosages of vitamin E and simvastatin ranged from 400 to 1000 U/day and 10 to 40 mg/day respectively. The pooled effect estimates for total cholesterol, LDL -C, HDL-C, and triglycerides were all statistically nonsignificant (Figures 15-18). Heterogeneity was minimal for all pooled estimates except for LDL-C (I 2 64.6 percent, p-value 0.04). The observed heterogeneity could not be explained by variation of doses of supplement or cardiovascular drug. The strength of evidence was insufficient for LDL -C, HDL-C, and triglycerides (Table 32). Other reported outcomes included C-reactive protein, prothrombin time, and platelet count. In a study of middle aged hypercholesterolemic subjects at low CHD risk, a statistically significant difference for C -reactive protein in favor of Vitamin E plus simvastatin was found (MD -0.40 mg/L (95 percent CI -0.66, -0.14]). 85 In another study of hypercholesterolemic subjects, no differences were found in prothrombin time and platelet count between Vitamin E plus pravastatin and pravastatin alone (reported qualitatively only). 69 Figure 15.

Vitamin K Vitamin K Plus Coumarin Derivatives Versus Coumarin Derivatives Alone One parallel -group RCT examined the effect of concomitant use of Vitamin K (5 mL volume per dose with concentration of 30 \u00b5g/mL vitamin K ) and warfarin.41 One cohort study was also identified that assessed whether vitamin K intake in subjects taking anticoagulants is associated with subtherapeutic INR.150 The results of this study have not been included in the evidence synthesis as it added no further insights to the existing randomized trial. The percentage of time that INR remained in the therapeutic range was reported (defined as INR within 0.5 of 2.0 to 3.0). Patients receiving Vitamin K stayed in the INR therapeutic range for a statistically significant longer percentage of time than patients who received warfarin alone. INR control was also examined in terms of the standard deviation of the INR 41 and the number of participants achieving improved INR control compared with six months prior to study. 41 Vitamin K was found to increase stability of anticoagulation treatment ( Table 33). Furthermore, the number of participants achieving stable INR was higher in combination with warfarin (RR 2.56 [95 percent CI 1.24, 5.28]). 41 Strength of evidence for the statistically significan t INR measures was low (Table 33 ). 73 Applicability. Participants with atrial fibrillation being anticoagul ated warfarin for thromboembolic prophylaxis, but with unstable INR control.41 The trial was of 6 months duration. Table 33.

Do the effect estimates of intermediate cardiovascular outcomes vary by age, ethnicity, gender, or health status? No studies for any supplement-drug combination of interest precluded exploration of heterogeneity in the effect estimates across preidentified subgroups for intermediate outcomes . Key Question 2b. Is there a measurable interaction between cardiovascular drugs and dietary supplements for intermediate cardiovascular outcomes? Two studies contributed to the evidence regarding statistical interaction between cardiovascular drugs and dietary supplem ents for this se ction.44,78 One study assessed statistical interaction using general linear modeling.44 No significant interactions were observed between the combination of omega- 3 fatty acids ( 4 g/day) and statins with regards to changes in lipid profile (HDL -C, LDL-C, total cholesterol, triglycerid es, non-HDL-C) in 52 obese men with dyslipidaemia and insulin resistance (moderate/moderately high risk for CHD).44 Authors of another trial78 conducted a formal assessment of statistical interaction using ANOVA and found that the decrease in triglyceride levels resulting from the combination of omega -3 fatty acids ( 4 74 g/day) and niacin was more than twice the additive effect of either therapies alone in 29 participants with atherogenic dyslipidemia (unclear CHD risk). Main Points for Key Question 2 \u2014Intermediate Outcomes We compared a dietary supplement co administered with a cardiovascular drug(s), with the cardiovascular drug(s) alone (or in conjunction with another supplement) to investigate comparative intermediate cardiovascular efficacy outcomes , subgroup effects and statistical interactions. Fifty-seven RCTs, two controlled clinical trials and no observational studies addressed this Key Quest ion. No study addressed the following outcomes: incidence of metabolic syndrome; carotid - intima media thickness ; and change in 10- year Framingham risk profile. Exploration of heterogeneity for pre identified subgroups ( e.g., males/females, ethnic groups, and the elderly) was not possible due to sparse data found for each supplement-drug combination of interest. No evidence was found for intermediate outcomes for the following supplements in combination with cardiovascular drugs: red yeast rice extract ; resveratrol ; vitamin A ; or vitamin D with or without calcium. Most evidence was from small, underpowered RCTs that provided inconclusive results. The strength of evidence for gradable outcomes was generally insufficient due to inconsistencies in the treatment effect direction and the wide confidence interval compatible to potential for both clinical benefits and harms. Low grade evidence indicated improvement in a few intermediate outcomes in the following dietary supplement plus cardiovascular drug versus cardiovascular drug alone: o HDL-C: garlic plus nitrates , fatty acids in addition to calcium channel blockers and aspirin, calcium channel blockers, statins plus aspirin and dipyridamole (in participants with mean baseline TG levels of 200 mg /dL or higher); vitamin E plus nifedipine; o LDL-C: vitamin plus nifedipine; o Systolic blood entage of time INR in therapeutic range , proportion of subjects achieving INR, proportion of subjects with stable INR): vitamin K plus anticoagulant (warfarin, coumarin derivatives) ; o time: Ginkgo Ginkgo biloba plus cilostazol; o with 50 percent or greater reduction): omega-3 fatty acids plus ACE inhibitors. Low grade evidence indicated no difference between omega -3 fatty acids plus statins compared with statins alone in the following measures: HDL-C, LDL-C, achieving LDL - C and pressure ; C-reactive protein; blood and bleeding time . Evidence was insufficient ( type II error could not be excluded due to the low power of studies) for the following supplement plus car diovascular drug combinations compared with the cardiovascular drug alone: 75 o lipid profile: coenzyme Q10 and plus niacin and aspirin;omega- 3 plus aspirin; vitamin E plus gemfibrozil, or statins ; o HDL-C: vitamin E plus nifedipine ;omega-3 fatty acids plus calcium channel blockers and aspirin , calcium channel blockers plus aspirin and dipyridamole ; o Triglycerides: niacin plus propranolol; garlic plus nitrates;omega-3 fatty acids plus ACE inhibitors; omega -3 fatty acids plus statins (in participants omega-3 fatty acids plus calcium channel blockers Blood pressure: garlic plus aspirin, or beta- blockers; vitamin E plus furosemide; vitamin E plus nifedipine; vitamin E plus gemfibrozil; o INR: Echinacea plus warfarin garlic omega -3 fatty acids plus warfarin . No statistical interaction was found for combination of omega -3 fatty acids plus statins for lipid parameters HDL-C, LDL-C, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and non-HDL-C. A positive interaction was found for the combination of omega -3 fatty acids plus niacin and aspirin for triglycerides. The decrease in triglycerides resulting from combination treatment was more than twice the additive effect of the therapies alone. Key Question 3 . In adults taking cardiovascular drugs, what are the effects of concomitant use of specific dietary supplements (when compared to cardiovascular drugs alone or cardiovascular drugs and a different dietary supplement(s]) on clinical or intermediate harms outcomes (e.g., organ toxicity, serious ad verse events, withdrawal due to adverse events) a. Do the effect estimates of harms outcomes vary by age, ethnicity, gender, or health status? b. Is there a measurable interaction between cardiovascular drugs and dietary supplements for harms outcomes? Overview A total of 58 unique studies were inclu ded for Key Question 3 (Table 34).39,44,46,47,49,51 - 53,55,56,78,81 -84,86,87,91,92,96,97,99,100 ,36-38,40-42,48,54,57 -69,71-77,88-90,93-95,98 One of the included studies was a retrospective cohort study,88 while the rest were RCTs. Summary characteristics of the study and population is shown in Table 35. One study examined the statistical interaction between vitamin E and aspirin 100 on harms. The characteristics of included studies are summarized in Table 34. Overall, the studies were generally of moderate risk of bias across all gradable harms , as summarized in Table 3 6. The harms outcomes examined across the included studies ranged from minor (e.g., flatulence) to serious (e.g., major bleeding). Although a higher proportion of the harms outcomes were 76 reported as continuous data rather than dichotomous data, the dichotomous outcomes were the focus of the present work, as these are the most suitable type of data for examining harms. A carryover effect was not a major concern in the crossover trials because most of the studies incorporated adequate washout periods in their design - well over five times the half -life of the drug supplement under investigation. However, a carryover effect may have influenced the results of 5 of the included crossover studies because it was not clearly reported, 37 the washout period was only one week ,99 or there was no washout period.42,75,86 Detailed study characteristics and data from each of the included studies are available in Appendix C. For each sup plement examined, we compared the different cardiovascular drug and supplement combination(s) versus the cardiovascular drug alone. For most supplement- cardiovascular drug related harms outcomes, data were either absent or too sparse with occasional events , precluding meaningful synthesis (Appendix C). Where subgroup analysis could be carried out, we report subgroup results as an additional consideration under the corresponding supplement. No data were found for the following supplements: red yeast rice, resveratrol, vitamin A, vitamin D (with or without calcium). Table 34.

Meta-analysis was not possible due to the low event rate across all of the harms outcomes. Coenzyme Q10 Plus Statins Versus Statins Alone Insufficient evidence was noted across all of the gradable clinical adverse events and organ toxicity outcomes for coenzyme Q10 plus statins versus statins alone, including serious adverse withdrawal due to adverse events,38,57 hepatoxicity (elevated alanine transaminase,38 or elevated aspartate aminotransferase38), and dysfunction (abnormal g lomerular filtration rate38) (Table 36 ). None of the included studies examined the gradable outcome bleeding. One RCT examined adverse events in general and zero events were observed.57 One small pilot RCT examined myalgia in 44 participants using visual Analogue Scale and did not find a statistically significant difference between coenzyme Q10 (200 mg/day) plus statins (simvastatin 10 statins alone (median 6.0 [inter quartile range 2.1, 8.8] vs. 2.3 [interquartile range 0.0, 12.8], p 0.63).38 Similarly, in this trial there was no statistically significant difference between coenzyme Q10 plus statin and statin alone groups in proportion patient s tolerating statin (16/22 versus 13/22, p 0.47; RR 1.23, 95 percent CI 0.80, 1.90). Note that this RCT38 was powered to detect a 9 mm difference in myalgia scores between treatment groups . Study designers assume d that less than 10 percent of patients would tolerate high dose simvastatin (40 mg/day) alone compared with 50 percent tolerating combined therapy , and that 50 percent of patients would tolerate lower dose simvastatin (10 mg/day or more) compared with greater than 90 percent tolerating combination therapy at the comparable simvastatin dose . Two RCTs examined fasting blood glucose as a continuous outcome; no differences were observed with 100 mg57 or 200 mg58 of coenzyme Q10 added to atorvastatin,57 or fenofibrate58 versus these cardiovascular drugs alone. Other continuous outcomes reported for the statins included myoglobin, 57 creatine kinase (CK), or were observed. Coenzyme Q10 Plus Statins Versus Vitamin E Plus Statins One small pilot RCT found a hig her frequency of decreased myopathic pain in the coenzyme Q10 (100 mg/day) plus statin group (16/18) versus the vitamin E (400 IU/day) plus statin group (3/14),and the relative risk ( RR) was 4.18 (95 percentCI1.50, 11.46).89 Similarly, significantly lower pain severity scores on the four pain intensity items of the Brief Pain Inventory Questionnaire,(MD -1.76 (95 percent CI -2.93, -0.58] ) and lower average pain interference scores on the seven items of the Questionnaire ( MD -1.43 (95 percent CI -2.76, -0.10] ) were observed in the coenzyme Q10 plus statins versus the vitamin E plus statins group. 89 No statistically significant differences were observed in phosphokinase levels. Participants in this trial used various type of statins in varying doses. Coenzyme Q10 Plus Fenofibrate Versus Fenofibrate Alone Insufficient evidence was noted across all of the gradable clinical adverse events and organ toxicity outcomes for coenzyme Q10 plus fenofibrate versus fenofibrate alone, including withdrawal due to adverse events, 58 elevated alanine transaminase,58 and elevated creatinine58 (Table 36 ). None of the included studies examined the gradable outcomes serious adverse events or bleeding. RCTs also reported abnormal electrocardiogram (EC G)58 and abnormal CK /CPK;58 zero events were observed. In another RCT, frequency of retinopathy was the same with 79 coenzyme plus fenofibrates (5/20) versus fenofibrate alone (6/20).58 One RCT examined fasting blood glucose as a continuous outcome; no differences were observed.58 Coenzyme Q10 Plus ACE Inhibitors Versus ACE Inhibitors Alone Insufficient evidence was noted across all of the gradable clinical adverse events and organ toxicity outcomes for coenzyme Q10 (33 mg three times daily ) plus ACE inhibitors versus ACE inhibitors alone, including hepatoxocity (elevated a lanine transaminase,54 aspartate aminotransferase54) and renal dysfunction (creatinine,54 blood urea nitrogen 54) (Table 37 ). None of the included studies examined the gradable outcomes serious adverse events, withdrawal due to adverse events or bleeding. One RCT also reported adverse events in general;54 zero events were observed. Table 37.

Echinacea A randomized open- label crossover trial in 12 healthy, non- smoking males with known CYP2C9 genotype reported zero total adverse events and withdrawal due to adverse events. The participants in this trial received a single dose of warfarin (25 mg/day) alone or after two weeks of pre-treatment with of 600 mg of Echinacea angustifolia roots plus 675 mg of E. purpurea root given four times a day59 Insufficient evidence was noted for the gradable outcome withdrawal due to adverse events (Table 38). Furthermore, this study did not report data on any of the other gradable outcomes (serious adverse events, bleed ing, renal dysfunction or hepatotoxicity). 59. Table 38.

Garlic Four RCTs examined garlic (4 to10 g/day) alone.60-63 The included patients ranged from healthy, non- smoking males 61 to individuals with cardiac conditions.60,62,63 The majority of studies were parallel RCTs (one crossover RCT 61) of moderate risk of bias. Meta- analysis was not p ossible due to the low event rate across all of the harms outcomes. Garlic Plus Warfarin Versus Warfarin Alone Insufficient evidence was available for the gradable harm bleeding for garlic (4 to 10 g/day) plus warfarin versus warf arin alone (Table 39 ).60,61 In one study, bleeding was defined as hemorrhage, epistaxis, hemoptysis, hematuria, bloody stools, he morrhage into organs, hemarthrosis, hematomas, or bruising.60 The other study simply indicated major bleeding 81 episodes.61 None of the included RCTs examined the gradable outcomes serious adverse events, withdrawal due to adverse events, renal dysfunction or hepatotoxicity. One RCT examined fasting blood glucose and anemia;60 no statistically significant effects were observed. Garlic Plus Nitrates Versus Nitrates Alone One RCT examined garlic (4 g/day) plus nitrates versus nitrates alone and did not report the results for any of the gradable harms.62 This RCT reported only one harm (fasting blood glucose as a continuous outcome) and found no statistically significant effects.62 Garlic Plus Statins/As pirin Versus Statins/Aspirin Alone Insufficient evidence was noted for the gradable outcomes renal dysfunction63 and hepatoxocity63 for garlic (4 mL/day ) plus statins/aspirin versus statins/aspirin alone (Table 39 ). This RCT63 also reported harms data related to leukopenia and fasting blood glucose; no statistically significant effects were observed. Table 39.

Abbreviation: NA = not applicable. Ginger No evidence of gradable outcomes was identified for this supplement. Mild diarrhea in 1/12 subjects was found in one RCT after two days of supplementation with ginger (3.6 g/day ) plus a single warfarin.64 RCTs examined /clopidogrel or ticlopidine versus these cardiovascular medications alone.48,64-68,90 Two of these studies included a single dose of a cardiovascular medication so their results should be interpreted with caution.67,68 The included patients ranged from those at risk for peripheral artery disease66 or stroke,48 to healthy adults65,90 and all 82 males.64,67,68 The majority of studies were crossover RCTs (two parallel RCTs 48,66) of moderate risk of bias. Meta-analysis was not possible due to the low event rate across all of the harms outcomes. Ginkgo Biloba Plus Aspirin Versus Aspirin Alone Insufficient evidence was noted across all of the gradable clinical adverse events and organ toxicity outcomes for G. biloba(240 mg /day,65, or 300 mg/day66) plus aspirin versus aspirin alone, including withdrawal due to adverse events,66 bleeding (nosebleeds and/or unusual bleeding),66 renal dysfunction,65 and hepatotoxicity65 (Table 40 ). None of the included studies examined the gradable outcome serious adverse events. No statistically significant differences were observed across the total adverse events (11/34 combination group versus 15/33 control group) and upset stomach (6/34 combination group versus 5/33 aspirin alone group) harms. 66 One RCT reported anemia and white blood cell count using continuous data but found no significant differences between the groups taking G. biloba plus aspirin group and aspirin alone. 65 Ginkgo Biloba Plus Aspirin and/or Pentoxiphylline Versus Aspirin and/or Pentoxiphylline Alone Insufficient evidence was noted for the gradable harm withdrawal due to adverse events for G. biloba(40 mg every 6 hours)plus aspirin and/or pentoxiphylline versus aspirin and/or pentoxiphylline alone48 (Table 40 ). This RCT reported 4/33 gastrointestinal events in the G. biloba plus aspirin and/or pentoxiphylline group compared with 3/29 events in the control group,48 which was not statistically significant. There was no report of any of the gradable outcomes serious adverse events, bleeding, renal dysfunction or hepatotoxicity. Ginkgo Biloba Plus Ticlopidine Versus Ticlopidine Alone Insufficient evidence was noted for the gradable harms renal dysfunction (raised c reatinine,68 or abnormal blood urea nitrogen68) and hepatotoxicity (elevated aspartate aminotransaminase,68 or elevated alkaline mg single dose ) plus ticlopidine versus ticlopidine alone (Table 40 ). The included RCTs did not examine any of the gradable outcomes serious adverse events, withdrawal due to adverse events or bleeding. One RCT examined the effects of G. biloba plus ticlopidin versus ticlopidin alone on hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and abnorma l ECG; zero observed. 68 Ginkgo Biloba Plus Warfarin Versus Warfarin Alone Insufficient evidence was noted for the gradable harms serious adverse events and withdrawal due to adverse events for G. biloba ( two tablets three times daily -each tablet with equivalent of 2 g of Ginkgo biloba leaf, 9.6 mg of ginkgo flavonglycosides, 2.4 mg of ginkgolides and bilobalide) plus warfarin versus warfarin alone (Table 40 ).64 This RCTs did not examine any of the other gradable harms, including bleeding, renal dysfunction, and hepatotoxicity. Furthermore, zero events were observed for constipation and no statistically significant differences were reported for diarrhea (0/12 combination group versus 1/12 control group). 64 Ginkgo Biloba Plus Digoxin Versus Digoxin Alone Insufficient evidence was noted for G. biloba(80 mg three times daily ) plus digoxin versus digoxin alone related to withdrawal due to adverse events (Table 40 ).90 However, no data were 83 available on the other gradable harms, including serious adverse events, bleeding, renal dysfunction, and hepatotoxicity. Furthermore, zero events were reported for adverse events and no statistically significant differences were noted for gastrointestinal adverse events (1/8 combination group versus 0/8 control group). 90 Ginkgo Biloba Plus Cilostazol/Clopidogrel Versus Cilostazol/Clopidogrel Alone Insufficient evidence was noted for Ginkgo biloba(120, and 240 mg /day) plus cilostazol/clopidogrel versus cilostazol/clopidogrel alone across all gradable outcomes, as none of these were reported.67 One RCT examined total adverse events; zero events were reported.67 Table 40.

Ginseng One parallel RCT examined the effects of 1. 5 g/day Panax ginseng( aqueous extract containing0.5 grams three times daily ) plus warfarin versus warfarin alone among patients who had experienced a stroke.69 Another parallel RCT examined the same comparison with 2 g/day American ginseng among healthy patients,70 while a crossover RCT examined the same comparison but with 3 g/day Korean ginseng among healthy non- smoking males.71 All three RCTs were of moderate risk of bias. Meta-analysis was not possible due to the low event rate across all of the harms outcomes. Insufficient evidence was noted across the gradable clinical adverse events, including withdrawal due to adverse events 71 and bleeding (no descr iption provided)69 (Table 41 ). None of the included RCTs examined the gradable outcome serious adverse events. Furthermore, insufficient evidence was noted for the organ toxicity outcomes (elevated creatinine,69 abnormal blood urea nitrogen,69 elevated aspartate aminotransaminase,69 and elevated alanine transaminase69), yet these were based on continuous data only (dichotomous data were not available). One RCT also exami ned prothrombin time, total adverse events, headache, dizziness, indigestion, INR above 3.5, diarrhea, and constipation;69 zero events were observed across all of these outcomes. Another RCT reported zero adverse events of clinical importance. 70 One RCT examined the outco mes hematocrit and anemia using continuous data;69 no statistically significant d ifferences were observed between intervention and control groups.

Furthermore, with sparse events, evidence was inconclusive for a difference between groups in flatulence, insomnia, headache, and dizziness. Magnesium One parallel RCT examined the effects of 4. 5 g/day oral magnesium plus hydrochlorthiazide versus hydrochlorthiazide alone,73 while another examined the same comparison with 15.78 mmol twice daily a mong hypertensive patients.74 In addition, one crossover RCT examined the effects of 365 mg/day oral mag nesium plus various beta adrenergic antagonists versus beta adrenergic antagonists alone among hypertensive patients.42 All three RCTs had moderate risk of bias. Meta-analysis was not possible due to the low event rate across all of the harms outcomes. Magnesium Plus Hydrochlorthiazide Versus Hydrochlorthiazide Alone Insufficient evidence was noted across all of the gradable clinical adverse events and organ toxicity outcomes for magnesium plus hydrochlorthiazide versus hydrochlorthiazide alone, including withdrawal due to adverse events73 and renal dysfunction (elevat ed creatinine 74) (Table 42). None of the included RCTs examined the gradable outcomes serious adverse events, bleeding or hepatotoxicity. One RCT examining hydrochlorthiazide observed zero events across diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, adverse events, hyperc alcemia, and fasting blood glucose harms.73 Furthermore, no statistically significant differences were observed for abnormal ECG (number of events not reported). 73 Magnesium Plus Beta Adrenergic Antagonists Versus Beta Adrenergic Antagonists Alone Insufficient evidence was noted for magnesium (365 mg /day) plus beta adrenergic antagonists versus beta adrenergic antagonists alone for the gradable harms serious adverse events,42 withdrawal due to adverse events,42 and renal dysfunction (abnormal serum potassium42) (Table 42 ). None of the studies reported the gradable outcomes bleeding or hepatotoxicity. 86 Table 42.

Niacin (Not More Than 250 mg) Harms were investigated among 20 patients with hyperlipoproteinemia in an open- label, randomized crossover trial of niacin mg /day) plus propranolol (20 mg /day) versus propranolol alone for 1 month.75 There was insufficient evidence for the gradable outcome withdrawals due to adverse events (Table 43 ).75 This study did not report gradable harms, such as serious adverse events, bleeding, renal dysfunction or hepatotoxicity. Furthermore, there were no statistically significant differences in nausea plus flushing ( zero events ) or hypotension plus asthenia (0/10 intervention group versus 1/10 control group). Table 43.

Omega- 3 Fatty Acids/Fish Oils Twenty-two studies (21 RCTs, and one retrospective cohort study) examined omega -3 fatty acids plus statins,36,37,40,53,92 -97 aspirin,47,52,78,98,99,99 aspirin and clopidogrel,88 aspirin in 87 combination dipyr idamole and calcium channel blockers ,52 warfarin,47,55 rampril,77 or fenofibrate,56. The included participants ranged from elderly patients with CHD,82 to adults with diabetes 87 or stroke,49 to healthy males 39 or adults.36,93,95,99 The majority of studies were parallel RCTs, yet there were 7 crossover RCTs,36,37,93,95- 97,99 and one retrospective cohort study.88 The majority were deemed as having moderate risk of bias, although two had low risk of bias 51,92 and one had high risk of bias.55 Meta-analysis was only possible for the statins; for all other cardiovascular medications, low event rates across all of the harms outcomes precluded pooling. Omega-3 Fatty Acids/Fish Oils Plus Statins Versus Statins Alone Eleven omega- 3 fatty versus alone.36,37,40,53,91 -97 One RCT had low risk of bias,92 while the rest were of moderate risk of bias, including the seven RCTs included in the meta- analyses.36,37,40,91,93 -96 Insufficient evidence was noted across all gradable outcomes, including serious adverse events meta- analysis (Figure 19 ), withdrawal due to adverse events meta -analysis (Figure 20), aminotransaminase meta- analysis (Figure 21), and alanine transaminase meta-analysis (Figure 22, Table 44). None of the included RCTs examined the gradable outcome bleeding. Meta-analysis was also possible for total adverse events (5 studies; RR 0.94 [95 percent CI 0.78, 1.12] Figure 23), dyspepsia (2 studies ; odds ratio [ OR] 1.61 [95 percent CI 0.46, studies; OR 0.76 [95 per cent CI 0.25, 2.30] Figure 25), constipation (2 studies; RR 0.94 [95 percent CI 0.63, 1.39] Figure 26), upper respiratory infection (2 studies; RR 1.33 [95 percent CI 0.34, 5.21] Figure 27), CK/CPK RR 1.50 [95 percent CI 0.43, 5.25] Figure 28); no statistically significant effects were observed. Results were consistently not statistically significant despite differences in low 36,93,95 versus moderate 37,40,94,96 CHD risk, and healthy patients 36,93,95 versus those with hyperlipidemia or dyslipidemia 37,40,94,96. We were unable to discern any effects of sex, ethnicity or age on the results, as these were not examined in the RCTs for which meta- analysis was deemed appropriate. RCTs also reported many other harms outcomes for which no statistically significant differences were observed , such as diarrhea (3/122 intervention versus 2/40 control).37 The RCTs also examined harms outcomes as continuous variables, such as leukopenia,97 anemia,97 red blood cell count,97 hematocrit,97 glycosylated hemoglobin,94 and fasting blood glucose;37,40,44,53,76,91,92,94 and one RCT found a statistically significant elevated fasting blood glucose in the omega -3 fatty acids plus statins versus statins alone group.40 88 Figure 19.

Bleeding in one study was defined as those episodes leading to deviation from the protocol (major and minor bleeding episodes: major bleeding defined as bleeding necessitating operat ion or blood transfusion; minor bleeding defined as all other episodes).47 The second study reported bleeding episodes of any type.99. None of the included RCTs examined the gradable outcomes serious adverse events, renal dysfunction or hepatotoxicity. No significant differences were observed across all harms, including constipation (1/12 intervention group versus 0/12 control group), 99 diarrhea (0/12 intervention group versus1/12 control group ),99 fishy taste (4/12 intervention group versus 0/12 control group),99 flatulence (0/12 intervention group versus 1/12 control group ),99 headache (1/12 intervention group versus 1/12 control group ),99 and nausea (3/12 intervention group versus 3/12 control group).99 One RCT reported leu kopenia as a continuous outcome, with no statistically significant differences observed.99 Omega-3 Fatty Acids/Fish Oils Plus Aspirin and Clopidogrel Versus Aspirin and Clopidogrel A lone One retrospective cohort study examined the effect of fish oils (mean dose 3 g/day plus/minus 1.25 g/day) in combination with aspirin and clopidogrel in 182 elderly subjects with coronary artery disease.88 An age and gender matched control group of subjects taking aspirin and clopidogrel alone was selected. Major and minor bleeding episodes were noted after a follow-up of 33 months. Major bleeding was defined as a decrease in hemoglobin of more than two grams, intracerebral hemorrhage, or any bleeding episode that required hospitalization. Minor bleeding was defined as epistaxis, abnormal bruising, and gastrointestinal bleeding that did not require hospitalization or lead to a decrease in hemoglobin of more than 2 g rams. No significant differences were found between interven tion and control groups. Strength of evidence for bleeding was insufficient (Table 44). Omega-3 Fatty Acids/Fish Oils Plus Aspirin, Dipyridamole, and Calcium Channel Blockers Versus Aspirin, Dipyridamole, and Calcium Channel Blockers One RCT also examined the effects of omega-3 fatty acids (eicosapentaenoic 3. 2 g/day) plus aspirin, dipyridamole, and calcium channel blockers versus aspirin, dipyridamole, and calcium channel blockers alone.52 Another RCT with a low risk of bias examined omega- 3 fatty acids ( 3 g/day) plus aspirin and calcium channel blockers versus aspirin and calcium channel blockers alone. 51 Insufficient evidence was noted for the gradable outcomes bleeding (described as bleeding complications)51,52 and withdrawal due to adverse events51 (Table 44). None of the included RCTs examined serious adverse events, renal dysfunction or hepatotoxicity. No statistically significant differences were observed re garding gastrointestinal events (7/43 intervention group versus 3/39 control group 94 Omega-3 Fatty Acids/Fish Oils Plus Warfarin Versus Warfarin Alone effects (3-6 g/day) plus warfarin versus warfarin alone.47,55 evidence was noted for the gradable outcomes bleeding 47,55 and withdrawals due to adverse events55 (Table 44). Bleeding in one study was defined as those episodes leading to deviation from the protocol (major and minor bleeding episodes: major bleeding defined as bleeding necessitating operat ion or blood transfusion; minor bleeding defined as all other episodes ).47 The other study reported major bleeding (defined as bleeding episodes causing death or requiring hospitalization, vitamin K, or blood transfusion) and minor bleeding (defined as any bleeding episode that did not qualify as a major bleed but that required a change in warfarin dosage or referral). 55 None of the included studies examined the gradable outcomes serious adverse events, renal dysfunction or hepatotoxicity. Furthermore, t hree patients with an unstable i nternational normalized ratio withdrew. Data were not reported by treatment groups.55 One of the RCTs reported gastrointestinal events, which did not differ significantly between groups (9/174 intervention versus 0/145 control ).47 Omega-3 Fatty Versus Ramipril and/or Irbesartan Alone One RCT with a moderate risk of bias examined the effect s of fish or marine oils (3 g/day)plus ramipril among patients at low risk of CHD.77 Insufficient evidence was noted for the gradable outcomes withdrawal due to adverse events, bleeding (erythrocyturia grade 3), and renal dysfunction (g lomerular filtration rate ) (Table 44). This RCT did not report the results for other gradable harms, such as serious adverse events and hepatotoxicity. Furthermore, zero events were observed for hyperc alcemia. Omega-3 Acids/Fish Oils Plus Fenofibrate Versus Fenofibrate Alone One RCT with a moderate risk of bias examined the effects of omega- 3 fatty acids (4 g/day)plus fenofibrate versus corn oil plus fenofibrate among patients with low CHD risk.56 Insufficien t evidence was noted for the gradable harms serious adverse events, withdrawal due to adverse events, and renal dysfunction (elevated creatinine) (Table 44 ). This RCT did not report results for the gradable harms bleeding or hepatotoxicity. Furthermore, no statistically significant differences were observed for constipation (1/84 intervention group versus 5/83 control group), diarrhea (4/84 intervention group versus 5/83 control group), flatulence (1/84 intervention group versus 3/83 control group), gastrointestinal adverse events (7/84 intervention group versus 5/83 control group) and nausea (5/84 intervention group versus 3/83 control group). 95 Table 44.

Vitamin E Ten RCTs examined vitamin E plus aspirin, statins, or furosemide versus these cardiovascular medications alone.39,46,49,81 -84,86,87,100 The included participants ranged from the elderly with CHD,82 to those with diabetes,87 or stroke,49 to healthy females.39 The majority of studies were parallel RCTs (with two c rossover RCTs 82,86) of moderate risk of bias. Meta- analysis was not possible due to the low event rate across all of the harms outcomes. Vitamin E Plus Aspirin Versus Aspirin Alone Three RCTs examined vitamin E plus aspirin versus aspirin alone.39,49,100 Insufficient evidence was noted for the gradable harms of bleeding (hemorrhagic events) after two years supplementation with vitamin E (400 IU/day) plus aspirin (325 mg /day) versus aspirin alone,49 and for withdrawals due to adverse events after 10 days of vitamin E supplementation (200 mg/day) plus low dose aspirin (80 mg /day) or aspirin alone100 (Table 45). None of the RCTs reported data related to the gradable harms serious adverse events, renal dysfunction or hepatotoxicity. No statistically significant differences were observed in the number of patients experiencing headache (28/121 intervention group versus 20/122 control group), gastrointestinal discomfort (14/121 intervention group versus 10/122 control group) or total adverse events (23/121 intervention group versus 24/122 control group) with 10 days of vitamin E supplementation (200 mg /day) plus low dose aspirin or aspirin alone. 100 One RCT examined the occurrence of cancer , and no statistically significant differences were observed (716/9966 intervention group versus 722/9968 control group)in a large sample of women (aged 45 years or older) supplemented with vitamin E (600 IU/day) plus low dose aspirin (100 mg /day) or aspirin alone over the period of 10 years . 39 98 Vitamin E Plus Nifedipine Versus Nifedipine Alone One crossover RCT examined the effects of vitamin E (900 mg/day) plus nifedipine versus nifedipine alone over four months in 30 elderly and moderately obese participants with stable effort angina. Insufficient evidence was noted across all of the gradable harms, including withdrawal due to adverse events, renal dysfunction, and hepatotoxicity (zero events we re observed).82 (Table 45) This RCT did not report on the gradable outcomes serious adverse events or bleeding. Furthermore, fasting plasma glucose was examined as a continuous outcome and no statistically significant difference was observed.82 Vitamin E Plus Furose mide Versus Furosemide Alone One parallel RCT examined the effects of vitamin E (600 mg/day) plus furosemide versus furosemide alone over 4 weeks in 24 hypertensive participants, and did not report the results of any of the gradable outcomes. Fasting blood glucose was reported as a continuous outcome; no statistically significant effect was observed. 81 Vitamin E Plus Statins Versus Statins Alone Five RCTs examined the effects of vitamin E plus statins versus statins alone in hypercholesterolemic or hyperlipidemic,46,83,84,86 or diabetic participants.87 In one trial very low dose of vitamin E was administered (100 IU/day) over three months46 in contrast to two other trials using higher doses (750 IU/day,87 and 1000 IU/day84)over six months. Insufficient evidence was noted across the gradable harms: organ toxicity (elevated alanine transaminase) with 100 IU/day vitamin E plus statins46 or 1000 IU/day vitamin E plus statins blood urea nitrogen (100 IU/day)46) , and QT intervals (measured as continuous var iable) with 400 IU/day over eight weeks83 (Table 45). None of the RCTs reported data on the gradable harms serious adverse events, withdrawal due to adverse events or bleeding. Furthermore, glycosylated hemoglobin, 87 leukopenia,46 and anemia,46 were examined as continuous outcomes and no statistically signifi cant difference was observed. Change in u rinary creatinine levels were not significantly different after 1 month supplementation with vitamin E (600 mg /day) plus statins versus 1 month statins treatment alone in one trial reporting this outcomes as a continuous variable.86 99 Table 45.

Key Question 3a. Do the effect estimates of harms outcomes vary by age, ethnicity, gender, or health status? A lack of evidence precluded exploration of heterogeneity in the effect estimates for harms across preidentified subgroups. Key Question 3b. Is there a measurable interaction between cardiovascular drugs and dietary supplements for harms outcomes? One RCT presented data that would allow examination of the interaction between vitamin E supplements and the cardiovascular medication aspirin. Participants in this study were 486 Norplant contraceptive implant receivers from five Asian centers. The main outcome of this study was vaginal bleeding, which is not discussed here (it was not an included outcome for the present review). This RCT found no significant difference in the rates of advers e events (headache, gastrointestinal discomfort, and withdrawal due to adverse events) among treatment regimes. 100 Main Points for Key Question 3 \u2014Harms Outcomes In this section we examined the evidence on harms outcomes, comparing dietary supplement(s) coadministered with cardiovascular drug(s), to cardiovascular drug(s) alone. 101 Fifty-seven RCTs and one retrospective cohort study contributed to the evidence. Overall, the studies were of moderate risk of bias across all harms, which ranged from minor (e.g., flatulence) to severe (e.g., l eukopenia, hemorrhaging). No evidence was identified for the effects of ginger, red yeast rice extract, resveratrol, vitamin A, or vitamin D in combination with cardiovascular drugs on clinical harms. No evidence for the following pre specified clinical harms were found: neurologic adverse events (e.g., neuropathy, seizure), and allergic reactions (anaphylaxis, skin, transient acute airway disease) . Sparse evidence precluded exploration of heterogeneity in the effect estimates for harms across preidentified subgroups. Meta-analysis was not possible due to the low event rate across all of the reported harms outcomes for all supplements examined except for omega- 3 fatty acids . A majority of the studies reported no events or no statistically significant diff erences across all harms and all supplements, including Echinacea, garlic, G. biloba, ginseng, hawthorn, oral magnesium, niacin (not more than 250 mg /day), omega-3 fatty acids , vitamin E, and vitamin K. For all gradable outcomes for which evidence was found, the strength of evidence was graded insufficient because type II error could not be excluded due to low power of studies to examine harms. Four RCTs examined the effects of coenzyme Q10 plus statins, fenofibrate or ACE- inhibitors versus these medications alone. The evidence for benefit of coenzyme Q10 in reducing myalgia, based on two small pilot studies, was inconclusive. One RCT found superior effect of coenzyme Q10 plus stain versus vitamin E plus statins in reducing myalgia. Another RCT found no significant difference in posttreatment myopathic pain between coenzyme Q10 plus statin and statin alone groups. Insufficient evidence was noted for meta- analyses for serious adverse events, withdrawal due to adverse events, and hepatic toxicity (abnormal levels of aminotransaminase , and alanine transaminase) for omega -3 fatty acids plus statins versus statins alone . No statistically significant effects were observed for meta-analyses of omega-3 fatty acids/statins for the following outcomes: dyspepsia, headache, constipation, upper respiratory tract infection, and creatine kinase. None of the other omega- 3 fatty acids RCTs found statistically significant results across all harms, except for one RCT that found a statistically significant elevated fasting blood glucose level. Six other RCTs did not observe a statistically significant difference for the blood glucose levels. Key Que stion 4 . In adults taking cardiovascular drugs, what are the effects of concomitant use of specific dietary supplements (when compared to cardiovascular drugs alone or cardiovascular drugs and a different dietary supplement[s]) on pharmacokinetic outcomes (e.g., half -life [t1/2], area under the concentration curve [AUC]) of cardiovascular drugs of interest? a. Do the effect estimates of pharmacokinetic outcomes vary by age, ethnicity, gender, or health status? 102 b. Is there a measurable interaction between cardiovascular drugs and dietary supplements for pharmacokinetic outcomes? Overview A total of 15 unique studies were screened in.36,59,61,64,68,70 -72,90,93,95,101,142,145,147 Three studies were removed from evidence synthesis because the dose of the dietary supplement was not reported,145 a cardiovascul ar drug was used that is not marketed in the United States,142 and finally a poorer study design sequential, single group before- after Ginkgo biloba and ticlopidine interaction study did not add to the available randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence.147 Thus, a total of 12 studies contributed evidence on exposure and pharmacokinetic outcomes (Table 47). Generally, these studies were open -label, crossover RCTs, of moderate risk of bias for outcomes of interest, and included between eight and 50 healthy volunteers (Table 48). Seven studies investigated cardiovascular drug kinetics following a single dose. 59,61,64,68,71,90,101 In keeping with the United States Food and Drug Admini stration guidance,30 seven studies reported pharmacokinetic outcomes potentially indicating cardiovascular drug interactions such as the area under the concentration curve (AUC) and maximum con centration (C max)as geometric mean ratios (dietary supplement plus cardiovascular drug: drug alone) with corresponding 90 percent confidence intervals.36,59,61,64,68,71,93 Others reported data as posttreatment means or median changes from baseline or geometric mean ratio with 95 percent confidence interval s. Carryover effects in these crossover trials was not a major concern because all study designs incorporated adequate washout periods, that were well over five times the half -lives of the drugs and supplements under investigation. Detailed study characteristics and data are tabulated in Appendix C . Statistical analyses were undertaken to compare the combination of dietary supplement plus cardiovascular drug with the cardiovascular drug alone. No evidence addressing Key Question 4 subquestions (a) or (b) was identified. No data were available on bioavailability and volume of distribution. No studies were found examining pharmacokinetic interactions between coenzyme Q10, magnesium, niacin ( not more than 250 mg/d ay), red yeast rice extract, resveratrol, vitamin A, vitamin D with or without calcium supplementation, vitamin E, or vitamin K , and a cardiovascular drug. 103 Table 47.

A randomized open-label crossover trial investigated exposure and pharmacokinetic interactions between a mixture of 600 mg of Echinacea angustifolia root plus 675 mg of E. purpurea root given four times a day for a period of two weeks, with a single dose o f 25 mg warfarin versus warfarin alone.59 Both S- and R- warfarin were reported, including AUC , Cmax, half-life, clearance and volume of distribution in 12 healthy males of known CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotype. The 90 percent CIs for the geometric means of all parameters were all within the bioequivalence range of 80 percent to 1 25 percent. Although not considered to be clinically significant, a statistically significant decrease in S-warfarin AUC , and increases in drug clearance and apparent volume of distribution were noted with co administration of the supplement (GMRs [90 1.18] respectively) .59 Strength of evidence is summarized in Table 49. Table 49.

GMRs of S- and R-warfarin AUC , Cmax , half-life and clearance for S - and R-warfarin were not statistic ally different; however, the 90 percent CIs went beyond the 0.8 to 1.25 clinical bioequivalence boundaries for C max of both S- and R- warfarin (GMR [90 percent 1.02 [0.8, 1.4]).61 Strength of evidence is summarized in Table 50. A crossover randomized t rial investigated changes in baseline statin pharmacokinetics coadministation with 3600\u00b5g of allicin given twice daily . The study randomized 10 healthy adults to single doses of simvastatin 20 mg and pravastatin 20 mg with a crossover after 24 hours.101 Subsequently all patients were administered garlic tab let additionally continuing 12000\u00b5g of gamma glutamylcysteine and 3800 \u00b5g of thiosulfinates for 21 days in the last 2 days randomized to single dose of one of the statins with a second crossover to the other. Hence, the investigation of change in statin pharmacokinetic with addition of garlic essentially originated in a nonrandomized before- after experimental study. Ninety-five percent geometric mean ratios of AUC0-24 h and half-life of statins were reported which included but went beyond the FDA specified m argins of bioequivalence based on 90 percent GMR. The difference in pre and postgarlic means in the outcomes of clearance, Cmax, and time to the maximum concentration (tmax) were not statistically significant, however, the data were not analyzed GMR with 90 percent CIs.

Statistically significant decreases in the t max were observed for both S- and R- significance of these findings is unclear. No interactions were noted for AUC , Cmax, half-life, clearance and volume of distribution; the GMR 90 percent CIs were not statistically significant, and were within the bioequivalence boundar ies of 80 percent to 125 per cent (Table 51 ). 64 Table 51.

Ginkgo Biloba Three studies examined pharmacokinetic interaction of Ginkgo biloba and specific cardiovascular drugs.64,68,90 All three studies were randomized crossover trials in healthy adults. In a study of 24 young healthy Korean males, single doses of ticlopidine (250 mg) were administered with or without G. biloba (80 mg).68 GMRs of AUC and Cmax of ticlopidine were not statistically different from unity, and were clinically nonsignificant (Appendix C ). Ticlopidine mean half- life and median t max were not significantly affected by coadministration with G. biloba.68 In eight healthy adults, digoxin mean AUC , Cmax, clearance, elimination rate constant, t max and half-life were not statistically different with 7 day treatment with G. biloba(240 mg/day) plus a single dose of 0.5 mg of oral digoxin on the last day, versus a single dose of 0.5 mg digoxin alone. 90 GMRs were not reported, or could be calculated in the absence of individual patient data; therefore, we could not rule out clinical interaction based on the predefined GMR margins of bioequivalence. 90 In 12 healthy male participants, no statistically or clinically significant differences were noted in geometric mean ratios of AUC , Cmax, half-life, clearance and volume of distribution of warfarin when administered as a 25 mg single dose with 7 day pre- treatment with Ginkgo biloba (12 g/day) or alone.64 However, there was significant reduction in t max of both S- and R- Based on the available data by group, we estimated that this decrease amounted to appr oximately 33 percent and 23 percent decreases in t max arithmetic means for S- and R- warfarin enantiomers respectively.64 Strength of evidence is summarized in Table 52. 107 Table 52.

Ginseng Interactions between American ginseng ( Panax quinquefolius , 2 g/day from weeks 2 to 4)and warfarin (5 mg/day for 3 consecutive days of weeks 1 and 4) given over 4 weeks were investigated in a parallel randomized double blind placebo controlled trial in 20 healthy volunteers.70 Compared with controls adm inistered warfarin alone, a statistically significant reduction in the warfarin AUC was noted when ginseng was co administered (between group difference in median change between week 4 and week 1-0.64 \u00b5g/mL per day [95 percent CI, - 1.25, -0.13]).70 The clinical significance of this finding is unclear because analysis was not based on geometric mean ratios. A second open-label randomized crossover trial in 12 healthy males of a single dose of 25 mg warfarin coadmin istered with a 7 day pretreatment with Korean ginseng (2 capsules 3 times a day, each capsule containing 0.5 g Panax ginseng root and 8.93 mg ginsenosides) or alone, found clinically interpretable results.71 The geometric mean ratios of S - and R-warfarin AUC , Cmax, half-life, clearance and vol ume of distribution were neither statistically nor clinically different, indicating no interaction. The GMR for t max of both S- and R-warfarins showed statistically nonsignificant results, but the lower and upper bounds of the 90 percent CI crossed the predefined bioequivalence boundaries (S- and R-warfarin respectively).71 Strength of evidence is summarized in Table 5 3. 108 Table 53.

Hawthorn Pharmacokinetic interactions between hawthorn( Craetagus oxycantha) and digoxin were investigated in eight healthy male volunteers in an open-label, randomized crossover trial of digoxin 0.25 mg /day for a 10 day period plus 900 mg/day of extract of hawthorn leaves with flowers standardized to 84.3 mg of oligomeric procyan idins for a 21 day period, versus digoxin alone for ten days.72 Using a paired analysis, the differences in means of AUC , Cmax, tmax, half- life, and clearance did not reach statistical significance.

Omega- 3 Fatty Acids/Fish Oils Three open -label randomized crossover studies in 24 to 50 healthy adult volunteers investigated interactions between omega-3 fatty acids and various statins.36,93,95 Each study compared statin (r osuvastatin 40 mg /day, 80 mg omega-3 fatty acids , with statin alone over a 14 day period. Due to the differences in first pass metabolism among various statins,166 we did not conduct meta- analysis of outcomes data. No statistically or clinically significant differences were noted for steady state AUC and C max GMRs for rosuvastatin, atorvastatin, 2-hydroxyatorvastatin, and 4- hydroxyatorvastatin. No statistically significant changes were observed in steady state - hydroxysimvastatin arithmetic means of AUC, C max, tmax, clearance and half -life.36,93,95 Strength of evidence is summarized in Table 5 5. 109 Table 55.

Applicability . Evidence of interaction affecting pharmacokinetic outcomes may not translate into altered clinical effectiveness or harms. Evidence originating in healthy young adults is not representative of older patients taking cardiovascular drugs. Metabolism of cardiovascular drugs may differ between the populations studied in these trials and CHD patients. Key Question 4a. Do the effect estimates of pharmacokinetic outcomes vary by age, ethnicity, gender, or health status? A paucity of evidence for supplement-drug combinations precluded exploration of heterogeneity in terms of preidentified subgroups such as age and gender. Key Question 4b. Is there a measurable interaction between cardiovascular drugs and dietary supplements for pharmacokinetic outcomes? Statistical interaction data were not reported in any pharmacokinetic study. Main Points for Key Question 4 \u2014Pharmacokinetic Outcomes In this section we examined the evidence on pharmacokinetics of cardiovascular drugs when coadministered with or without a dietary supplement. Clinical significance of interaction was evaluated using the FDA guidance. According to the guidance, a statistically significant interaction does not determine clinical significance of interactions unless the 90 percent confidence intervals of the geometric mean ratios fall outside of the defined no effect range of 0.80 to 1.25. Twelve randomized controlled trials contributed evidence on pharmacokinetic outcomes. All trials were conducted in small numbers of healthy participants. 110 No studies were found examining pharmacokinetic interactions between coenzyme Q10, magnesium, niacin ( not more than 250 mg/d ay), red yeast rice extract, resveratrol, vitamin A, vitamin D with or without calcium supplementation, vitamin E, or vitamin K , and a cardiovascular drug. No clinically significant interactions were noted when Echinacea , ginger, or Ginkgo biloba were warfarin , and when Ginkgo biloba was co administered with ticlopidine. The strength of evidence for these finding was graded as low because evidence was limited to single pharmacokinetic studies with moderate risk of bias. Available evidence was insufficient , precluding meaningful conclusions about interactions between garlic and and statins, between ginseng and , and omega-3 fatty acids and rosuvastatin or atorvastatin were unclear; for some of the pharmacokinetic outcomes there was low strength of evidence suggesting no clinically relevant interactions , and insufficient evidence for others. A paucity of studies of supplement-drug combinations for which data were available precluded exploration of heterogeneity in terms of pre identified subgroups such as age and gender. Statistical interaction was not investigated in any pharmacokinetic study. 111 Discussion Key Findings and Strength of Evidence Billions of dollars are spent annually in the United States on complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) , and a large portion of this expenditure is spent directly on dietary supplements.8 Given the high prevalence of cardiovascular disease and frequency of polypharmacy in this population, the risk of drug-supplement interactions deserves serious consideration primarily to avoid potential harm; either as a result of decreasing clinical effect of drugs, or increased toxicity. There is also a real possibility of drug interactions leading to synergistic effects and positive clinical outcomes. A more thorough understanding and knowledge of potential drug-supplement interactions is important to provide specific evidence-based recommendations that do not call for universal avoidance of all dietary supplements in conjunction with pharmaceutical treatments to treat or to prevent cardiovascular disease. Without such precision, recommendations may result in the avoidance of potentially beneficial supplements or more importantly might be more readily ignored, leading to greater likelihood for harm through negative interaction. This systematic review identifies a considerable knowledge gap regarding the impact of combining dietary supplements with cardiovascular drugs in patients with cardiovascular disease. We sought to identify the direct and indirect evidence for cardiovascular drug- dietary supplement interactions and their outcomes, and found 69 unique studies contributed evidence for synthesis. With few exceptions there is insufficient evidence to draw any strong conclusions on particular interactions between dietary supplements and cardiovascular drugs. In addition to an overall lack of evidence, the studies that were included were generally not powered to assess the clinically relevant outcomes we pre- identified as being most relevant . In addition, many of the studies had important methodological limitations or were poorly generalizable to the population of relevance. The strength of the evidence found was frequently compromised by poor allocation concealment and issues related to blinding, study reporting, and potential for conflict of interest. Evidence of direct impact (or lack thereof) on clinical outcomes such as heart attack or stroke is most useful for patients and providers. Twenty -two randomized controlled trials reported direct evidence of drug -supplement interactions on predetermined gradable clinical outcomes; however, most of the trials were grossly underpowered to demonstrate any real effect, and often were of moderate risk of bias, leading to insufficient grades for strength of evidence. We found evidence of impact on clinical outcomes from studies that evaluated two non -gradable outcomes. In one randomized controlled trial (RCT) postangiography restenosis rates were improved through consumption of 3.2 grams of eicosapentaenoic acid taken along with aspirin, dipyridamole, and calcium channel antagonists for a duration of six months. 52 This finding was not supported by a similar but lower quality trial in India.51 The second non- gradable clinical outcome of note came from a large long -term pragmatic trial in which 19,934 women were randomized to 600 IU of vitamin E plus 100 mg /day of aspirin versus aspirin taken alone for 10 years. In this trial, no significant differences occurred between groups in a composite outcome consisting of nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and vascular confidence interval (CI) 0.79, 1.13]). 39 Anticipating a paucity of evidence describing the influence of cardiovascu lar drug-dietary supplement interaction on meaningful clinical outcomes, we also sought indirect evidence of such interactions. Fifty- nine studies were identified that addressed intermediate cardiovascular 112 outcomes (blood pressure, lipid profile, Internati onal Normalized Ratio (INR), metabolic syndrome, change in 10-year Framingham risk profile, and QT prolongation) .Again, these were mostly underpowered studies of highly selected individuals, with considerable risk of study bias attributed to inadequate blinding, and allocation concealment. As a result, the most frequently graded strength of the evidence was \"insufficient,\" with a few outcomes graded as \"low\". In our review, we found some of the richest evidence on the combination of omega- 3 fatty acids with cardiovascular drugs. Out of a total of 24 RCTs that measured both gradable and non- gradable surrogate outcomes, 13 assessed the combination omega- 3 fatty acids with statins (atorvastatin, simvastatin, lovastatin). From pooled results of six trials40,44,53,96,151,163 and five trials40,44,53,96,151 respectively, no beneficial or harmful effect on HDL -C or LDL -C was found (low strength of evidence). While the evidence for total cholesterol and triglycerides was inconclusive (i.e., statistica lly non-significant pooled estimates with wide 95 percent confidence interval), there appeared to be some trend indicating possible improvement in these outcomes for patients taking omega-3 fatty acids with statins, which might not have reached the level o f statistical significance due to low power of the meta-analyses. Results regarding non- HDL-C and total cholesterol/HDL -C ratio were inconsistent across studies. In addition, there was evidence of low strength from one parallel arm RCT92 and one crossover RCT37 that systolic blood pressure was improved when statins were taken with omega-3 fatty acids. The addition of omega- 3 fatty acids to statins (only in participants with high baseline levels of TG) or the combination of aspirin and a calcium channel blocker with or without dipyridamole appears to reduce triglyceride levels but not HDL- C or LDL- C.40,51,52,76 It is likely that the triglyceride drop reflects the activity of omega -3 fatty acids alon e rather than a synergistic or additive effect in combination with antiplatelet agents and calcium channel blockers. The combination of omega- 3 fatty acids with ACE -inhibitors appears to have no significant effect on blood pressure and also demonstrates evidence consistent with omega-3 fatty acids having an independent benefit for triglyceride reduction. 152 In patients with biopsy proven IgA nephropathy, a s ingle 6-month duration RCT found that the inclusion of omega-3 fatty acids with renin -angiotensin system blockers reduced the degree of proteinuria in comparison to the cardiovascular drugs.77 In the only trial that assessed for pharmacodynamic interaction between warfarin and omega-3 fatty acids, there was no evidence of differences in coagulation based on INR; however this was a very small study (11 participants ) and neither data nor confidence intervals were provided to evaluate this further. 55 The inclusion of coenzyme Q10 with statin drugs seems to have no significant effect on any parameter of lipid profile predetermined to be a gradable out come (high - or low-density lipoprotein- cholesterol (HDL -C or LDL-C), triglycerides, and non- HDL-C). Only one study explored the effect of coenzyme Q10 with fenofibrate on cholesterol levels and hypertension.58 Although the trial failed to demonstrate any interaction, the RCT was underpowered to find any significant results. A similar situation applies to a small sized RCT comparing the combination of coenzyme Q10 with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor on ejection fraction among patients with heart failure. 54 One RCT of 60 patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) suggests that the combination of 4 g/day of garlic oil taken with nitrates has a positive effect on HDL-C levels compared with nitrates taken alone. 62 This result , while statistically significant, may not be clinically meaningful and likely does not reflect an interaction between the two agents so much as an isolated effect of garlic, since nitrates are not known to affect HDL- C. In a single RCT conducted in an elderly population (at least 65 years), platelet adhesion (a non-gradable outcome) decreased significantly through concomitant use of vitamin E with 113 aspirin.49 In another RCT, supplementation with vitamin E in patients taking nifedipine led to a significan t beneficial change in LDL -C (low strength of evidence).Again, we suspect this is an isolated effect of the dietary supplement rather than reflective of an interaction between vitamin E and nifedipine itself. Finally , supplementation with low doses of vitamin K (0.1 to 0.15 mg/day) in patients anticoagulated with warfarin appeared to provide stability to INR titration and increase time within the therapeutic range based one study in participants of unknown ethnicity.41 The stabilizing effect of vitamin K was independent of pre-specified subgroup status including gender (male/female) and age (younger or older than 65 years) in one of the studies where this was evaluated. 159 Outcomes related to harms associated with drug interactions between dietary supplement and cardiovascular drugs were reported in 57 unique studies, most of which were considered to be at moderate risk of bias. Gradable harms outcomes included serious adverse events, withdrawal due to adverse events, bleeding, renal dysfunction, and hepatotoxicity. Of the studies that assessed harms outcomes, reported adverse events ranged from mild (e.g., flatulence) to severe (e.g., leucopenia, major bleeding), but for all the gradable outcomes for which evidence was found, the strength of evidence was judged insufficient primarily due to a lack of power contributing to the possibility of a type II error. Furthermore , very few studies systematically screened for predefined adverse events. With respect to non-gradable harms outcomes, results on benefit of coenzyme Q10 in reducing statin induced myopathic pain were inconclusive. Two pilot trials with small sample sizes reported conflicting results regarding myopathic pain. One of these trials, 89 reported potential benefit of coenzyme (100 mg /day) added to statins (varying types and doses) compared with vitamin E added to statins. The other study,38 reported no significant differences in reduction of myalgia or number of participants tolerating statin between groups treated with combination of coenzyme Q10 (200 mg/day) or simvastatin (10 to 40 mg /day) alone. In one RCT significantly elevated fasting blood glucose occurred in the omega- 3 fatty acids plus statins group versus the statins alone group. 40 Finally, evidence for interactions between cardiovascular drugs and dietary supplements was sought from studies that assessed for direct changes in drug pharmacokinetics when combined with any of the supplements in question. Gradable pharmacokinetic outcomes included area under the concentration curve (AUC), maximum concentration (C max), clearance, and drug half - life. Eleven studies contributed pharmacokinetic evidence, all of which had moderate risk of bias. We found no clear evidence of drug-supplement pharmacokinetic interaction. Evidence was either low or insufficient to rule in or out clinically important pharmacokinetic interactions , or showed no clinically important interactions. The following findings were graded as having low strength of evidence. Coadministration of Echinacea with warfarin may reduce the AUC of warfarin with statistical significance, but warfarin was still within the range of clinical bioequivalence. Supplementation with Ginkgo biloba, garlic, Panax ginseng or ginger extracts in patients taking warfarin does not appear to change measurably any clinically relevant warfarin pharmacokinetics . American ginseng demonstrated a shift in AUC of warfarin; however the clinical significance of this shift is not clear. No pharmacokinetic interaction between G.biloba and ticlopidine was identified. Finally interactions omega-3 fatty acids and statins (rosuvastatin, simvastatin, and atorvastatin) are unclear - while for some important pharmacokinetic outcomes there was evidence of no clinically important interactions (low strength of evidence), others remained inconclusive (insufficient evidence). No studies examined pharmacokinetic interactions between coenzyme Q10, magnesium, niacin (up to 250 mg /day), 114 red yeast rice extract, resveratrol, vitamin A, vitamin D (with or without calcium supplementation), vitamin E, and vitamin K with any of the cardiovascular drugs. Clinical Context and Applicability of Evidence for Decisionmaking The purpose of this review was to synthesise the available evidence regarding the clinical significance of drug interactions between dietary supplements and cardiovascular drugs, in order to provide recommendations for medication management to care providers and patients. Ideally, any such recommendations would arise from the synthesis of studies that evaluate meaningful clinical outcomes in the context of relevant drug interactions. In the absence of studies that provide enough data to make strong recommendations we employed a search for a hierarchy of outcomes incl uding meaningful clinical outcomes (i.e., stroke, myocardial infarction), intermediate or surrogate outcomes (i.e., lipid profile, anticoagulation parameters), harms outcomes (i.e., bleeding, adverse drug effects) and finally, pharmacokinetic evidence of interaction (i.e., changes in AUC, drug clearance). Decision makers should be aware that when a strong recommendation cannot be supported by clinical outcome data, recommendations can still be made with intermediate, harms and pharmacokinetic outcomes but the strength of these recommendations cannot be considered to be equal. The correlation between surrogate and clinical outcomes relies on the clinical rationale that surrogate outcome measures truly predict the clinical outcome. Anticipating that the evidence linking drug interactions to clinical outcomes would be sparse, we were careful to ensure appropriate selection of intermediate, harms and pharmacokinetic outcomes by soliciting expert opinion and a strong clinical rationale for each chosen surrogate outcome. Our findings organised according to this hierarchy is provided in T able 56. Furthermore, interpretation of this report and assessment of its clinical relevance requires acknowledgment of some of the limitations of the data within. The reader must recognize that dietary supplements in the US are not regulated i n the same manner as prescription drugs. This has led to some fundamental barriers to conducting and interpreting clinical research with dietary supplements. M anufacturers of supplements are not held to the same standards as manufacturers of prescription and over-the-counter drugs with respect to providing evidence of efficacy and safety prior to marketing. 109 Dietary supplements do not require FDA approval, nor are there any FDA regulations that require evidence of purity, quality or composition prior to marketing. This has resulted in a lack of standardization of these products among manufacturer s and even among products from a single manufacturer. Products that claim to have standardized composition of active ingredients (if known) most often cannot claim standardization of biologic activity. Furthermore, postmarketing assessment of \"standardized\" herbal preparations often reveal that claims on the product label are not true. 167-170 These products are available in pharmacies, grocery stores, health food stores, and via the internet , and are s old by many different vendors. Lack of manufacturing regulations, and labelling standards may result in significant differences between products, unbeknownst to the consumer, that l imit the external validity of clinical trials. In addition to concerns over quality and quantity of active ingredients, concerns over purity can be troubling. Botanical products and herbal remedies can on oc casion be contaminated with heavy metals or interact with other medications. If present, this interference puts patients at risk for toxicity and interactions from other substances that otherwise would be attributed to the supplement. 170-173 Finally, there is little reliable , published information regarding the safety of dietary supplements. Until only recently, manufacturers of dietary supplements were not obliged 115 to report serious adverse events. This represents a gros s discrepancy compared with what is required of prescription drugs. Although, the FDA has recently taken steps to make serious adverse event reporting mandatory, most of the data in this report predates that mandate, and even since 2008 when the mandate wa s put in place, the FDA believes that adverse events are significantly underreported.174 Table 56.

Most of the studies included in this review that measured clinical outcomes provided inconclusive findings, primarily due to limitations in study design (underpowered), and risk of bias (allocation concealment, randomization). The weakness of the evidence itself , and its clinical rele vance is compounded by a general lack of evidence on dietary supplement- cardiovascular drug interactions in the literature overall. Ultimately this limited information makes it impossible to translate our findings into clear advice and tools for clinical d ecision- making. The limited evidence also did not permit an effective dose -response evaluation to distinguish dose thresholds at which interactions may result. Without an adequate evidence base from the literature, variability in effects across clinically important subgroups (i.e., stratified by age, ethnicity, gender or health status) could not be assessed. The evidence on clinical outcomes was generally inconclusive and applicability of inconclusivity was meaningless. The trials were generally efficacy st udies in highly selected cardiovascular populations lasting for a short period of observation, along with some single-dose studies in healthy individuals. Reported benefits or \"lack of harm\" from studies not powered to assess these outcomes , or those in healthy volunteers may not translate in to efficacy or safety in the elderly population with cardiovascular disease. As such we are unfortunately left with the unsatisfying yet fundamentally important call for more research with focused consideration and evaluation of dietary supplement-drug interaction in both clinical and observational studies. The limit of good clinical outcomes data on which to base recommendations, leads to predicting hypothetical interactions wherein indirect evidence is the most prevalent albeit least reliable information source. The study of pharmacokinetic outcomes and changes in these outcomes are best suited to address this area. However, evidence of pharmacokinetic alterations due to interaction may not translate into altered clinical effectiveness or harms even if well characterized. Pharmacokinetic studies are generally conducted in healthy volunteers and as such the evidence may not reflect the compromised physiologic processes of the elderly and the diseased. With relatively limited findings given its scope, the value in this review is that it points out the need for further consideration of the question of interactions and comparative effectiveness 117 for dietary supplements when considered in conjunction with cardiovascular drugs. Aside from further research in the area of dietary supplement -drug interactions, better documentation of supplement use by cardiovascular patients is critical to better define where interactions may result in clinically relevant sequelae. Review of O ther Systematic Reviews Recent systematic reviews related to the topic of dietary supplement -drug interactions do not address the same scope, are not comprehensive, or involve different populations of interest. Mills and colleagues published a systematic review in 2005 focused on the effect of natural health products on the metabolism of conventional medicines. 115 Their focus was not cardiovascular drugs or patients in particular, and they described the evidence for dietary supplement-drug interactions for any conventional drug category. The evidence in the review is compiled from 41 pharmacokinetic st udies. Mills' review identified a lack of evidence supporting any interaction between coenzyme Q10 and warfarin, Gin kgo biloba and warfarin, and G. biloba and digoxin. These finding are consist ent with those in our review. Both reviews identified a shift in AUC of INR when American ginseng was taken in conjunction with warfarin; however, we question the clinical significance of this finding. Also in 2005, Desai and colleagues published a review of interactions between dietary supplements and antiplatelet agents. 175 The review included both clinical trials and case reports. With respect to the dietary supplements considered in our review, Desai concluded that omega-3 fatty acids given in conjunction with aspirin led to comparatively significant reductions in ADP induced platelet aggregation, blood platelet count, thromboxane B2, and restenosis rates, and also led to a prolongation in bleeding time. The addition of vitamin E to aspirin led to comparatively significant redu ctions in platelet adhesion, ischemic stroke, recurrent episodes of TIA, and prolonged dental bleeding time. Unlike our review, the Desai review did not attempt to grade the outcomes extracted and while findings are largely consistent, the graded evaluation we completed did not allow the same confidence in conclusions regarding the interactions from these agents based on the directness and overall strength of evidence. In one of the more relevant reviews published by Izzo and colleagues in 2005, Pubmed was searched to Feb 2003 for drug interactions with cardiovascular drugs, and evidence was included from case reports (43 studies) and clinical trials (eight studies ). 116 This review did not systematically evaluate the quality of evidence, nor was there any grading of the strength of their recommendations. For example, drug interactions between Ginkgo, garlic, and ginseng were identified based on few or single case reports w hile our review found low or insufficient evidence of any interaction from trials of both direct and indirect evidence. In a 2009 review by Izzo and Ernst, the evidence was again extracted from case reports (41 studies) and clinical studies (17 studies ) but did not focus on drug interactions with cardiovascular drugs. 119 None of their 17 clinical studies provided evidence for dietary supplement-cardiovascular drugs within the scope of our review. Skalli and colleagues published a review in 2007, wherein the majority of evidence for supplement-drug interactions was generated from case reports, and there was no focus on cardiovascular drugs. 176 The authors identified interactions between warfarin and all of the following: ginger; Ginkgo biloba; garlic; and ginseng. This was again primarily from single case reports or case series. Our review found no evidence of such interactions from clinical trials providing direct or indirect evidence (insufficient or low levels of evidence). The reviewers also 118 suggest that G.biloba can counteract the effect of thiazide diuretics by increasing blood pressure (based on case report data).We found insufficient evidence to support this claim. The most recent systematic review on dietary supplement -drug interactions was published in 2010 by Kennedy and Seely, and examined herb- drug interactions identified from trials whereby herbal impact on hepatic metabolism via cytochrome P450 isoenzymes could be ascertained.121 In this review, the target population was not specific to cardiovascular patients or drugs, and the review evaluated indirect evidence limited to herbs metabolized via the cytochrome P450 system. While the information from this review provides an evaluation of primarily indirect data regarding possible pharmacokinetic interactions, the results do not overlap meaningfully with the findings from our review , which addresses only direct evidence for pharmacokinetic interaction. Limitations of the Review Limitations of our systematic review process include our restriction of the number of dietary supplements of interest to 16 of the most commonly used; this was necessary given limitations of resources and review time. Up to 30 percent of included studies were assessed to have the potential for financial conflict of interest and approximately 45 percent did not report funding information. Given t he uncertainties involved in interpreting asymmetry tests for publication bias in most reviews, especially in presence of heterogeneity in effect estimates, we did not plan to investigate publication bias in this review. 102,103 In fact, a recent recommendation is that tests for funnel plot asymmetry should be used only in a minority of meta- analyses including at least ten studies of unequal sizes per analysis without substantial heterogeneity in their effect sizes.104 However, other means of evaluating publication bias and selective outcome reporting exist, such as comparing publications with study protocol, which we did not adopt because of time and resource limitations . Seemingly, another limitation could be the exclusion of indirect evidence of drug interactions derived from surrogate measures such as alterations in probe drug metabolism, that highlight effects on enzymes involved in drug metabolism. 121 As such, evidence traditionally originates in healthy volunteers; applicability of such evidence would have been as much of a concern as for the pharmacokinetic outcom es we examined , the applicability of which was restricted to healthy volunteers with uncompromised drug metabolism. In order to make causal inferences possible for translation into practice, we also excluded combinations of multiple dietary supplements with cardiovascular drugs. For example, a given combination of multivitamins coadministered with a cardiovascular drug(s) would be limited both in causal inference of supplement -drug(s) interactions and applicability to the specific doses and combinations of vitamins employed as intervention in the study. Empiric evidence indicates that authors are more likely to report in an international English- language journal if results are positive, while publishing negative findings in German- language literature. 177 We restricted eligibility criteria to English and German language records. We are unsure as to the magnitude (if any) and direction of language bias introduced as a result of excluding Chinese language literature for several reasons . First, traditional Chinese, and Ayurvedic medications, which are often concoctions of many herbs, were not included in this review. Secondly, most reports of randomized controlled trials published in Chinese journals lack an adequate description of randomization, and many non-randomized controlled trials have been published as randomized controlled trials. 178 Thirdly, negative CAM findings are more likely to be published in mainstream medical journals (that is, English -language journals), while positive CAM findings are more likely to be published in CAM journals (which tend to be non-English-language journals). 179 Lastly, there is evidence that countries such as China, Japan, 119 Russia, and Taiwan publish more CAM studies with positive results than studies with negative results; this imbalance may reflect publication bias.180 Conclusions With limited data to discern evidence on dietary supplement- drug interactions, it is difficult to provide clear guidance to clinicians and patients regarding advice on the choices to be made in this area. Drug interactions that may result in positive or negative outcomes likely exist, and occur, but the evidence available and identified in this review is insufficient to provide clinical recommendations with confidence. The strength of evidence that we did find was low at best, with poor grading resulting from risks of bias, and small sample sizes greatly increasing the risk of type II error. In addition, the etiology for results are difficult to determine effectively as changes in a measured outcome could be due to either a real therapeutic effect that comes from the dietary supplement itself or be due to an interaction between the drug and the supplement in question. With these caveats in mind, and the fact that the most reliable data comes from indirect intermediate outcomes associated with clinical results, the following is a summary of the clearer indications of interactions from the evidence reviewed: Omega-3 fatty acids (2 to 4 g/day) from fish and/or supplements likely do not interfere with the efficacy of statin therapy or calcium channel blockers in presence of antiplatelet agents, and may provide independent benefit in resolving hypertriglyceridemia. Vitamin K (0.1 to 0.15 mg/day) may help to stabilize INR when given with warfarin. Garlic (4 to 10 g/day) may not interact negatively with nitrates and warfarin and may confer independent benefit in improving HDL and total cholesterol. Our confidence, however, in the validity and reproducibility of these findings is low. Limitations of the Evidence Base The literature search applied in this review was comprehensive in exploring multiple sources for human level evidence, yet despite this, there was a decided lack of relevant evidence. The available literature came primarily from small trials of highly selected patients and subjects that limited external validity. While there was data from which we can derive a sense of lack of interaction in many cases, the small size of the trials made it impossible to ascertain the potential for a true clinical interaction . Had the trials been adequately powered, evidence of harm or interaction may have been seen . The internal validity of most trials was compromised due to flawed designs, lack of appropriate allocation concealment, and risk of bias. There were very few examples where a formal assessment of statistical interaction was completed. One notable exception came from a trial whereby a decrease in triglyceride levels due to combination of omega- 3 fatty acids with niacin led to twice the additive effect of the each therapy alone, indicating the possibility for synergy through concurrent use. 78 In the absence of corroborating pharmacokinetic evidence or assessment for interaction, it is often impossible to d etermine whether a difference in outcome was due to a true pharmacological interaction, or due to more independent combined, or possibly counteracting therapeutic effects. As the goal of this synthesis work was not to complete a comparative effectiveness a nalysis of dietary supplement versus drugs for cardiovascular disease we did not formally assess for these comparative therapeutic effects. 120 In terms of the pharmacokinetic evidence assessing Key Question 4, most of the research was conducted on healthy young adults. Thus this level of evidence may not be applicable to older patients taking cardiovascular drugs due to possible differences in metabolism and the existence of comorbidities. One of the principal limitations of the trials we evaluated was the fa ct that they were very small and thus susceptible to type II error. A slimly reassuring corollary to this is that if there was a real and dramatic clinical impact due to an interaction then some clinical effect would likely have shown up despite being unde rpowered for smaller effect sizes. Of greater concern are possible interactions that could arise through polypharmacy of prescription drugs, a situation all too common, in particular for the elderly population. Future Research Recommendations Given the imp ortant gap in research in the area of dietary supplement -drug interactions there should be a strategic investment in building research capacity to address relevant questions. With the continued burden of cardiovascular disease in North America, this issue is not going to go away and will likely increase in magnitude if the public continues to increase their use of dietary supplements for self- care. A focused research strategy regarding dietary supplement -cardiovascular drugs could consider a number of recom mendations arising from this review: 1. First and foremost, future research with dietary supplements should involve substances for which the identity of the agents can be clearly ascertained and the chemical composition well characterized, and ideally standardized. If the active ingredients or biologic activity of these substances is not known then studies to characterize these variables, identify mechanisms of action and describe safety should precede clinical efficacy studies. According to the 2011-2015 stra tegic plan of the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM), clinical trials of dietary supplements will not be supported without documentation of biology and mechanism of action 105; 2. As extant literature is largely based on few small size efficacy studies of limited internal validity examining inter mediate outcomes, future supplement- cardiovascular drug interaction trials should focus on meaningful clinical outcomes, be appropriately powered and rigorously conducted and reported, and provide precise measurements of both clinical effectiveness and har ms outcomes; 3. Most studies were conducted in speciality settings, excluded patients with comorbidities, or uncontrolled comorbi dities, and did not include et hnic and racial minorities; prospective trials should be representative of the population taking cardiovascular drugs in terms of comorbidities, setting, and racial distribution. They should also collect data and undertake subgroup analysis for age, gender, race, comorbidities (e.g., liver or renal compromise), and genotypic polymorphisms of the cytochrome P450 enzyme; 4. A substantial number of pharmacokinetic interaction studies did not report and analyze pharmacokinetic outcomes as per Food and Drug Administration guidance for bioequivalence studies. 30 As such future experiments of drug interactions must evaluate pharmacokinetic outcomes as geometric mean ratios with predefined margins of bioequivalence. This would help in interpretation of statistically significant and nonsignificant outcomes in terms of clinical significance; 121 5. Given a dearth of studies examining interactions between specific supplements and cardiovascular drugs, future clinical trials and observational studies that explore the effect of cardiovascular drugs should additionally assess the use of dietary supplements, and include this in the reporting of results. One way to facilitate this would be to consider inclusion of inquiry for dietary supplement use and other CAM care in reporting guidelines such as CONSORT; 6. Phase I trials of cardio vascular drugs should include older populations, and if possible a pharmacokinetic assessment that includes dietary supplement usage; 7. As subgroups were underrepresented in existing studies, future studies investigating supplement-drug interactions should examine vulnerable subgroups such as the elderly, those with compromised renal and liver functions, and patients with multiple comorbidities; 8. Where possible, comparative effectiveness studies should include a statistical analysis for supplement drug interactions, and the trials should be powered accordingly; 9. Until well powered , experimental studies are conducted to examine dietary supplement - drug coadministration , evidence from well-conducted prospective observational studies should be sought. Observational studies compliant with STROBE guidelines should be powered appropriately to address predefined endpoints of both efficacy and safety in a naturalistic setting, where the population sampled is reflective of the population in whom this data would be meaningful; 106 and 10. Given the difficulty and resource intensive nature of clinical trials, other sources of data should be considered to derive information regarding drug-dietary supplement interactions. Possibilities include synthesis of reports of adverse events made to both FDA and the Pharmacovigilance program at Health Canada. In addition, electronic health record linkages between databases of dietary supplement use and cardiovascular dr ug prescription may also add to the sparse evidence of supplement-cardiovascular drug interaction that currently exist. 122 Reference s 1.
