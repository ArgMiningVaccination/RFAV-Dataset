The company has been engaged in developing detailed animal welfare standards applying them to a growing number of meat, egg, and dairy products in its stores since 2004. The following animal welfare standards for laying hens were developed after hundreds of farm visits and consultations with farmers, pullet growers, poultry geneticists, and animal welfare scientists . These standards are developed and periodically updated for each production system in which laying hens are raised for eggs sold or used at Whole Foods Market. The intention of these standards is not to imply that one production system is better than another, but rather that each system is unique and has different ways to achieve good animal welfare. All standards that apply to a production system must be met for the farm to receive certification. Standards that are criti cal to welfare of birds are identified with an asterisk following the standard number and has a more stringent corrective action process . Further stipulations: If any standard in this document conflicts with local, State, or national regulations of laws, please contact Whole Foods Market Quality Standards. If adhering to a standard as written might compromise the welfare of birds on farm, the producer should submit a Deviation Request to Whole Foods Market Quality Standar ds for a determination. A food safety certification must be in place for all packing facilities that do not fall under USDA scrutiny. WHOLE FOODS MARKET PROPRIETARY INFORMATION Version 10 .6, March 21, 202 3 2 Production Systems Birds must be able to move about freely in a housing environment with amen ities that support their natural behavior. Birds must have access to an outdoor area that is at least equivalent to the area of the house. Birds must have access to rangeland or grassland. Birds must be raised in an outdoor system that supports life on rangeland or grassland for their entire production cycle. Note s: Standards as written are required for all four production systems unless otherwise specified. Mobile housing has emerged as an option for both Pasture Raised and Outdoor Living systems. Farms with small permanent coops , housing approximately 500 birds are also more common and may qualify as Outdoor Living. Standards specific to mobile housing ar e so indicated .

Pasture Raised, Outdoor Living Rangeland or grassland environments as required in Standards 7.4 through 7.7 must be continuously maintained at all times of the year . 7.4: Rangeland composition To qualify as rangeland, there must be sufficient accessible areas of tall plants, bushes, and/or trees surrounding the house or coops that are plentiful enough to accommodate all the birds in the flock. See Vegetative Assessment Guide in Appendix VIII. 7.5: Grassland composition To qualify as grassland, the outdoor area must consist of a mixture of various naturally occurring or planted grasses, forbs, and legumes. 7.6: Grassland qualification from permanent housing 1. Pasture Raised To qualify as grassland, the area must average at least 50% rooted vegetative cover, measured across the outdoor area beginning at 50ft (15.2m) from the house and extending 500ft (152m) or to the fenceline, whichever is closer. 2. Outdoor Living To qualify as grassland, the area must average at least 75% rooted vegetative cover, measured across the outdoor area beginning at 50ft (15.2m) from the house and extending 500 ft (152m) or to the fence line, whichever is closer. Note : See Vegetative Asse ssment Guide in Appendix VIII. 7.7: Grassland qualification from mobile housing To qualify as grassland, the area must average at least 75% rooted vegetative cover, measured across the outdoor area beginning 25ft (7.6m) from the mobile unit and extending 500ft (152m) or to the fenceline, whichever is closer.

Outdoor Access There must be enough cover/shade to provide 25% of the number of birds in the flock with at least 0.4ft2 (0.04 m2) of effective cover/shade at all hours of the day. 2. Pasture Raised (permanent housing) There must be enough cover/shade to provide 50% of the number of birds in the flock with at least 0.4ft2 (0.04m2) of effective cover/shade at all hours of the day. 3. Pasture Raised (mobile housing) Outdoor Living (permanent or mobile housing) There must be enough cover/shade to provide all birds in the flock with at least 0.4ft2 (0.04m2) of effective cover/shade at all hours of the day. Note: Cover/shade is best provided using natural components of the environment. Tall plants that were previously considered weeds make excellent cover if allowed to grow. Bushes, woodlands, brushy areas, fallen trees, or piles of cut branches are the preferred environments for birds. Meeting this standard using artificial shade structures can be more expensive and more difficult to maintain. 7.11: Mobile housing component of cover and shade 1. Mobile units can be included as part of the cover/shade requirement providing: a. The floor of the mobile unit is at least 2ft (0.6m) above the ground. b.

WHOLE FOODS MARKET PROPRIETARY INFORMATION Version 10 .6, March 21, 202 3 19 Appendix I: Definitions Animal by -products Feed ingredients derived from the slaughter process . Aviary A multi -tiered environment for hens in permanent housing . Blinds Objects birds can hide behind, such as vertically placed boards, hay bales placed in the middle of the floor, etc. Blinds provide an area of limited visibility where birds can seek protection from aggressive flock mates. Cage A cage is any boxlike enclos ure of bars, slats or wires, or a brooding structure composed of drawers or compartments, within which birds are confined. Cover Because of their innate fear of overhead predators, chickens seek out areas where they can be under objects that make them fee l safe, whether indoors or out. In their native habitat, this would be bushes and low -growing trees and plants. Indoor cover: Low objects or installations birds can go under for protection. Note that the laying area of the nest is not considered cover . Outdoor cover: Natural vegetation, low objects, or structures that birds can go under for protection. Outdoor cover generally also provides shade. Depopulation Removal of a flock when birds have reached the end of production or wh en there has been a disease outbreak. Edible Foraging Material Chickens' natural behavior is to forage for food throughout the day. In modern production systems feed is provided in such a manner that their nutritional needs are met without the need to for age, but the behavior pattern is embedded in their DNA. One of the principal causes of feather pecking and cannibalization is the driving need to forage with nothing in their environment to satisfy that urge. Providing supplemental edible foraging material , separate from feed, that encourages foraging behavior helps mitigate negative behaviors . Edible foraging material can be provided in pans, scattered in litter , or can be hung in net slings. Examples of edible foraging materials are whole or sprouted grai ns, seeds, hay, vegetables, or insects. Hay bales are an excellent choice because they provide vegetative components the birds can eat and act as blinds behind which they can find shelter. Farm A farm is a contiguous property on which laying hens are raised. WHOLE FOODS MARKET PROPRIETARY INFORMATION Version 10 .6, March 21, 202 3 20 Farm plan A written outline of farm practices and protocols that both ensure consistency in farm operations and provide a guide for anyone who steps in to manage the farm, such as during family vacations or emergencies. Feather loss Different from feather pecking, feather loss is generally the response of large numbers of birds to stressors in their environment. Feed -related issues are the most common cause of feather loss. Feed can be ra ncid or spoiled, it can contain different ratios of components than normal, or the amount of feed can be inadequate. Sudden changes in lighting or air quality can also stimulate a spontaneous molt, as can other stressful conditions such as heat, cold, dise ase and lack of adequate amounts of water. Flock Birds that are housed together in a discrete group . In permanent housing, this can mean all birds in one house or the birds in part of a house if there is a partition between groups of birds. In mobile housing, this can mean all birds in one mobile house or birds in a group of mobile houses if they can use any of the mobile houses at will. Friable Dry and crumbly, a qualifier for functional litter and ground condition in areas outside the house. Hospital or sick pen A confined area where birds that are injured or ill can recover. If a bird's injury is severe or illness is non-recoverable , it must be euthanized. Integrated pr oduction Coordinated production of all stages of the life of the bird from the placement of chicks in the pullet house, transition to laying environment and extending through depopulation . Litter Organic material used on solid flooring to provide comfort as well as dust bathing and foraging opportunities for the birds . Fecal matter is not litter. Lux A unit of illumination that is used for defining the amount of ambient light in an area. Morbid The outward display of being unhealthy. Outdoor management plan Farm protocols and practices that result in continuously robust outdoor environments for the birds, including rotation protocols, inspection criteria and management of stocking rate, contamination, and cover and shade. WHOLE FOODS MARKET PROPRIETARY INFORMATION Version 10 .6, March 21, 202 3 21 Pasture environments Rangeland A type of pasture environment comprised of a variety of tall plants, forbs, shrubs, bushes, rocks, woodlands, orchards, etc. that attracts birds by providing cover, shade, and foraging. Rangeland vegetation must be visible t o birds from the door of the house and close enough to be accessible to the birds. Essential attributes of rangeland are overhead cover to encourage ranging and vegetative material that stimulates foraging. Trees, bushes, and tall plants are examples of overhead cover. Fallen branches, twigs and leaf litter are examples of productive and interesting foraging opportunities. A properly managed rangeland will also offer a variety of insect populations that attract birds to forage. Grassland A type of pastu re environment with rooted vegetative ground cover composed primarily of low growing grasses, legumes, and herbs. Vegetation can be growing or dormant, depending on the season, but must have intact roots. Perches Perches enable birds to wrap their feet around a rail and balance whether standing or roosting . Perches are elevated above the floor or platform. Sections of slats , even when raised above the floor level , do not qualify as perches. Production system The t ype of system the farm uses for raising laying hens. The production systems we accept are Cage -Free Plus, Outdoor Access, Pasture Raised, and Outdoor Living. Staging platform or rail A rail or platform in front of nests to provide birds with a place to st and as they wait for a nest and as they perform nesting rituals. Traceability Protocols and records that show the path of eggs fro m the farm to the carton at Whole Foods Market stores . Traceability protocols must ensure all eggs are from farms that have b een certified to meet Whole Foods Market Animal Welfare Standards for Laying Hens for the production system that is on the label. Traceability must also include compliance with the FDA Egg Rule or Whole Foods Market Food Safety Standards for Small Farms.
