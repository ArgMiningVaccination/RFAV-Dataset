Your participation in this research study is voluntary. It contains important inform ation about this study and what to expec t if you decide to participate. Please consider the information carefully. Feel free to ask questions before making your decision whether to participate. The purpose of the RECOV ER research study is to better under stand the long -term effect s of COVID - 19, and who is at greatest risk of having long -term effects. We will do this by studying people with, and without, a history of COVID- 19 over several years. If you take part, we wi ll ask you to complete questionnaire s, have brief medical exams , provide blood and urine for testing, and provide saliva , nasal swabs, blood, and stool for research . This study will last up to four years and will involve doing a questionnaire every 3 mon ths and coming for an in person v isit up to three tim es in the first year and once a year after that . You may be asked to have additional medical tests, explained later as Tier 2 and Tier 3 tests. At the first study visit, if you agree, you will : Complete a series of questions about who y ou are (such a s age, sex, or race), medical conditions that may affect the chances of having long -term effects of COVID -19, whether y ou have been vaccinated against COVID -19, and any symptoms you currently have. There will also be questions about your ment al health , soc ial de terminants of health, discrimination, di sability, and substance use. The questionnaire you are asked to complete will depend on whether you were diagnosed with COVID- 19 and when you were diagnosed. Have a brief medical exam. Allow us to collect samples of your blood, saliva, stool, nasal swab and urine. Some of the blood and urine will be sent to a clinical lab to run some laboratory tests. These tests are explained in more detail later in this consent form. Based on the res ults of the question naire and the tests, you may be asked to complete more tests. Consent Version: 07/22/2022 Page 2 of 23 HSPP Use Only: Consent form Medical v2021-09-07 At follow -up visits you will be asked to: Answer a shorter series of questions that will ask about how you are doing. We will ask you to do this at every three months Have a brie f medical ex am. T his will happen at six months and then yearly. Allow us to collect a nasal swab and blood every three months during the first year, and then yearly after that. You may be asked if we can repeat some of the tests you completed at the fir st visit. There are po ssible risks to taking part in this research. A complete list of all possible risks and discomforts related to this research is described in detail later in this consent form. Answering the questionnaires poses no physi cal risk but there may b e a risk that some of the questions may cause you emotional stress, and there is a small risk of breach of confidentiality. Most of the exam and tests like weight, height, and blood pressure measurements pose no risk. The risks of genetic tes ting a re dis cussed in detail later in this form. Having blood taken pose minimal risks like lightheadedness or feeling faint. Redness, pain, bruising, bleeding, or infec tion may occur at the site of a puncture during blood collection. During this study, yo u ma y have exposure to radiation from CT scans and X -rays, and if you have an MRI scan there may be risks with that too. You will not benefit personally from being in this st udy. However, we hope that in the future, other people might benefit from this study by im proving the understanding of how to meet the needs of COVID -19 patients and survivors mor e effectively. Taking part in this study is optional. If you decide not to participate, your decision will not interfere with your care, payment for your health care , or your eligibility for health care benefits. The University receives compensation from the sponsor of this study for the conduct of this study. If you h ave any questions, please discuss this with your study doctor.

MD University of Arizona, College of Medicine- Tucson Banner -University Medical Center - Tucson Tucson, AZ 85724 Joyce Lee- Iannotti , MD University of Arizona, College of Medicine- Phoenix Banner -University Medical Center - Phoenix Phoenix , AZ 85004 Eric Reiman, MD CEO, Banner Health Research Executive Director, Banner Alzheimer 's Institute Phoenix , AZ 85006 For questions or concerns about the study, please call the study team at 520 -621-8354 or email uahs- recover@arizona.edu . Why is this study being done ? This study is part of a research project paid for by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) called RECOVER (Researching CO VID to Enhance Recovery). We are d oing this stud y to u nderstand how COVID affects the body, and why some people who got COVID are still sick many months afte r being infected. This condition is called \"Long COVID\" or \"PASC,\" which stands for Post-Acute Sequelae of CoV-2. Sequelae mea ns a long -term e ffect of a n illness or injury. The people in this study will be 18 years or older. Both a dults who have had COVID and those who have not will be part of the study. How long will I be in this study? This st udy will last up to four years. During that time , you will answer survey questions every three months for up to four years and will have in -person visits up to three times in the first year and once a year after that . Consent Version: 07/22/2022 Page 4 of 23 HSPP Use Only: Consent form Medical v2021-09-07 How many people w ill take part in this study? Research ers plan t o include about 17,680 people at multiple sites across the United States. We hope to include about 909 people across Arizona. What will happen if I take part in t his study ? If you choose to take part i n the study, we will firs t ask you to sign this cons ent form before you d o any other parts of the study. We will ask you to either sign a paper version of this consent form , or we can use a computer, tablet or smart phone to sign the form electronically. T he study staff will help you with this. There are th ree types of study visits: Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3 Everyone who take s part in the study will complete the Tier 1 surveys and tests. O nly some participant s will be asked to do Tier 2 or Tier 3 surveys an d tests. This consen t form talk s about the surveys and tests for Tier 1 and Tier 2, and about the surveys and tests for Tier 3 that are low risk (very low chance of hurting you). By agreeing to be a part of this study, you are agreeing to do any of the low-risk tests that ar e approp riate for y ou. Some Tier 3 tests are higher risk , and we will separately ask your permission to do those tests later if we request that you to do them . Tier 1 surveys and tests for al l research participa nts Tier 1 Survey s can take place either in per son at the study office or at home . When you start the study, the surveys will take about 2 hours. After that, the surveys will take about 45 minutes . The number of questions you will be asked and the amount o f time the surveys will take depen ds on your answers to the questions. Consent Version: 07/22/2022 Page 5 of 23 HSPP Use Only: Consent form Medical v2021-09-07 At the first visit, we will ask you questions about you, your health, behaviors, medical problems, and medications. We will also ask some questions about your home, and the neighbo rhoo d you live in. In additi on, we wil l also ask ab out COVID related items including any testing , COVID vaccine status , and any related health problems you have had. We will look at your hospital records if you had to stay in the hospital because of COVID. If we can't access your hea lth record s, we will as k you some of these questions instead. Every three months after you start the study , we will ask you about how you are currently feeling, and about any new diagnoses ( illnesses ) your doct ors have found or new medicines you are takin g. While you ar e in th e study , we will check national registries (places where information about people acros s the country is kept) and your medical records to find out about your health and about any tests you have had outside the research study . Your me dical reco rds ma y be in cluded in the study to help the team fully understand your condition. If you have Long COVID when you start this study , we will let your primary care physician know that you are part of t his study . If you join the study while you ar e still in the h ospital, we will reach out to your doctors and nurses to learn about your treatment plans . Tier 1 tests At the first visit, we will do the tests listed below, numbered 1 through 5 . For people who ha d COVID - 19 we will do them again at 6 months after your infe ction , if you enroll in the s tudy before that time . If you are a participant who did not have COVI D-19, we will repeat the tests 6 months after your enrollment in the study. If your tests are normal at 6 mont hs, we won't do them a gain. If your tests are not normal, we may do th ese tests once a year for the rest o f the study or until they turn normal. If you agree, we will sometimes collect a total of 6 \u00bd tablespoons (95.5mL) of blo od. Some of the blood is fo r lab tests and some is for banking for future research. This will not happen at every v isit. This amount of blood is safe to collect, but you may choose to have the blood collected on two separate days. 1. Laboratory tests : We will draw ab out 3 (44 mL) tablespoons of blood from a vein in yo ur arm at each visit, and up to 21 tablesp oons (308 mL) over 4 years. The blood will be use d to check blood sugar tier s, cholesterol tiers, vitamins, protein tiers, h ormone tier s and other compoun ds found in the blo od. We will also collect urin e for a urinalysis test. See next page for the second set of blood that may be collected Consent Version: 07/22/2022 Page 6 of 23 HSPP Use Only: Consent form Medical v2021-09-07 2. Samples for future testi ng: We will also take samples to store for testing i n the future , explained in this table below. Sample s To be Collected When They will Be Collected How Much Will Be C ollected Each Time Blood 1st Visit, 3 months, 6 months, year 1, y ear 2, year 3 , year 4 51.5mL (ab out 3 \u00bd tablespoons) Urine 1st visit, year 2 10mL (about 2 teaspoons) Nasal Swab 1st Visit, 3 months, 6 months, year 1, y ear 2, year 3 , year 4 1 swab Stool 1st Visit, year 2 25mL (about 1 \u00bd tablespoons) 3. Exam (Check -up): We will meas ure your weight , height, waist, blood pressure , heart rate, and oxyg en tier. 4. 3 0 second sit -stand test: You will be asked to s it in a straight -back chair without arm rests, rise to a fu ll standing position, and sit back down. We will count how many time s you can do thi s in 30 seconds. 5. Ac tive Standing Tes t: This is a blo od p ressure test where we will measure your blood pressu re at different times while you are lying down and standing up. Tier 2 surveys and tests for some research participants About 1 in 3 of the people completing Tier 1 tests will be asked to do Tier 2 tests . Those with certain symptoms or findings in Tier 1 tests will be trigg ered t o have Tier 2 tests that are specific to their signs or symptoms . For example, if a person has an abnormal r esult on one of the lab tests they ma y be asked to have an addit ional t est. We will also choose some people without sym ptoms randomly (like b y flipping a coin) to do Tier 2 tests. You m ay be asked to complete these tests up to 4 times over the cours e of the study, but not more often than once a year. Tier 2 tests ma y inclu de the following : Blood tests Blood tests are done to follow up on fin dings in Tier 1. EKG An electrocar diogram is a test that records the e lectrical signal from your heart by plac ing electrodes on you r chest to record your hea rtbeat. 6 minute w alk te st We will see how far you can walk in 6 minutes. We will set -up cones in a long hallway and count how many laps you can do. Visio n Screening This vision test uses an eye chart o n the wall. You will be as ked to read the rows of le tters that get smal ler. Smell Test A smell te st uses c ards with smell strips on the m. We will activate a smell and ask you to ident ify it. There are 40 strips to smell . More tests on next page Consent Version: 07/22/2022 Page 7 of 23 HSPP Use Only: Consent form Medical v2021-09-07 Home sleep study The test measure s how you sleep using a monitor . This test is d one at hom e with a NOX T3 home sleep device . Examinations by a physician or other health care specialist These include testing your fee ling in your legs or ar tery function ; testing your vision (how well you can se e); examining your nose, throat and ears; checki ng your sense of smell; or testing ho w well you can do basic activitie s like walking or using your hands. Cognitive ( thinkin g) tests This tests your mem ory, attention , mood, and thinking . This takes about 20 minutes. Pulmonary function tests You will be asked to br eathe in dif ferent ways (f ast, slow, deep, shallow) through a plastic tube in your mouth to measure how wel l the lungs are work ing. Ultrasoun ds These tests use sound waves to get a picture of yo ur heart, kidneys or liver. CT scan of lungs CT scans use X rays to get a picture of y our lungs. Glucose Tolerance Test You will be as ked to drink a sugar y drink a nd we will col lect blo od samples to check yo ur blood glucose tiers. Tier 3 Tests About 1 in 5 people will be aske d to do some tier 3 tests. You would only do each Tier 3 test once. Below is a list of low risk Tier 3 tests. You will be asked to sign a separate consen t form t hat describes the proc edures and risks f or any Tier 3 test that has more than very low ( minimal) risk. Low risk Tier 3 tests may include the following: Blood tests Blood tests are done to follo w up on findings in Tier 1 or Tier 2. Sleep study This tes t measure s how you sle ep using a mon itor. This test is done overnight at the sleep cente r. Examinations These include testing your hearing and testing how your blood vesse ls work with a sensor on your finger Cogniti ve (thinking ) and mood tests Tier 3 ha s more detailed tests of memo ry, attention, mood and thinking than Tier 2. These ma y take 1-2 hours. Eye exam This includ es tests of your vision, eye pressure, and movement. We would use drops to dilate your e yes.

Consent Version: 07/22/2022 Page 8 of 23 HSPP Use Only: Consent form Medical v2021-09-07 What benefits can I expect from being in this study ? We do not expect for you to benefit directly from taking pa rt in this study, and w e also do not exp ect that your health will get bet ter from be ing a part of this study . Being part of the study may help you and your doctor better understand problems that are due to COVID. The results of the study will be important in hel ping patients, ca regivers, and par ents understand how COVID affects the body 's long - term reaction to COV ID. Can I be in t he study if I am pregnant or breast -feeding? Arizona sites are not part of the pregnancy cohort, so we are not enrolling pregnant people . What risks, side effects or discomfo rts can I expect from being in the study? Being in this study may involve some risks or discom forts from study proced ures. In addition t o the risks listed below, there may be risks that have not been seen before. You sho uld contact the Study Site Leader if you are c oncerned about anyt hing while you are a part of the study . Possible loss of privacy or confidentiality Whe n we share your inf orm ation and study samples, there is a small risk that people may get to see it who are not supp osed to. R esea rchers will do their best to protect yo ur privacy by keeping identifying information about who you are in a different place fro m the other informatio n you are giving us and any results. We will keep your study information and stud y sampl es as securely a s possible. Research ers using your informa tion and study samples must agree n ot to try to find out who you are. However, there is a small chance they may be able to find out who you are . The research team may communicate with you electr onica lly, such as o ver e mail or te xt me ssage. While the researchers will take steps to protect y our privacy and confidentia lity, te xt messages are not encrypted and not a secure mode of communication, and th ere is a risk that people may see the mess ages wh o are not supposed to. T he resea rchers will only send limited information in these messages. Whe n you use apps or softwar e made b y companies, su ch as wearable fitn ess trackers, wearable sleep monitors, or other mobile or web apps, there is a small risk t hat p eople outside the r esearch study m ay get to see your inf ormation who are not supposed to. Risk of surveys , office te sts and ultrasounds , inc luding: Surveys and t ests of thinking Physical examinations Tests of smelling, vision, hearing and sleep Blood tests Ultrasounds Consent Version: 07/22/2022 Page 9 of 23 HSPP Use Only: Consent form Medical v2021-09-07 Answeri ng the survey question s can t ake a long time. This may make you tired, uncomfortable, or frustrate d. You can stop or take a break i f you need to. The other tests listed are routine medical procedures with minimal risk . Risk of COVID nasal s wab (COVID test using liquid from your nose ) The nasal swab test may be uncom fortable and may cause a sma ll number of people to gag, cough or have a nosebleed . Risk of having blood taken Blood will be drawn through a needle pl aced into a vein in your a rm. Havi ng blood taken may be uncomfortable o r make you feel dizzy or faint (pass out) or lightheaded . Tell the staff right aw ay if you feel like you might pass out . Redness, pain, bruising, bleeding, or infection may also happe n where the need le goes in to the ski n during blood collection. Tests of how well you see ( Vision testing ) There is a very low ( minimal) risk from vision tests. The eye dro ps use d to dilate yo ur eyes (open the pupils to see in the eye) may sting. You may have glare an d blurry visio n for seve ral hours whil e your eyes are dilated. Some people are allergic to eye dro ps. Some people ha ve an increase in eye pres sure which would m ake yo ur eye red or painful that goes away with time . These problems will be treated if they occur. 6-minu te walk test and bre athing tests (pulmonary funct ion tests ) You may get tired, ligh theaded or dizzy during these tests . There is minim al medical risk fr om these tests. Sleep Study monitor ing at home The sleep study needs strap s around your ch est and abdo men, a small clip on your finger, sensors on your chest for heart monitoring (electroc ardiogram) and small plastic prongs in your nose . These may cause local skin irritation or allergies and can disrupt your sleep. The sleep study monitoring i n the sleep center wil l include 8 electrodes on your scalp an d chin and two electrodes on the l egs that may also cause local skin irritation or disrupt your sleep. Electrocardiogram (ECG) There is minimal medical risk from ECG. The sticky pads (electr odes) that are put on your chest c an some times cause discomf ort such as redness or itching. We may ne ed to shave your c hest befo re we put the pads on. Shaving may also bother the skin. Exercise testing The main risks of exercise testing are abnormal heart b eats (a rrhythmias), change in b lood pr essure (too high or to o low), heart attack (myocardial infar ction), muscle, bone, or joint injury, or death. However, these problems are very rare: they happen in less than 1 in every 5,000 to 10,000 tests, with death estimat ed at 1 in every 20,000 tests. You can stop the test at any time if you do not feel well. Consent Version: 07/22/2022 Page 10 of 23 HSPP Use Only: Consent form Medical v2021-09-07 Radiation Exposure from CT scan Your participation in this study may involve exposur e to radiation from CT scans. You may receive a chest CT in your first year and no more than one chest C T each su bsequent ye ar for up to four years. This exposure is not ne cessary for your medical care, is for research purposes on ly, and is necessa ry to obtain the desired research informa tion. Radiation has been shown to cause cancer from exposures that are signific antly highe r than th e additional radiatio n dose you will re ceive by participating in this st udy. According to the International Commiss ion on R adiological Protection (IC RP), th e increased risk of health effe cts, such as cancer, from radiat ion dose s of this amou nt is either too sm all to be observe d or nonexistent. The effective radiation dose you will receive in your firs t year from these research scans is approximately 6 milliSieverts mSv . A Sievert is a meas ure of the amount of ioni zing radiation. The total effective dose you will receive from all combined x -ray and CT scans is approximately 22 mSv. The organ receiving the highes t dose in this study is the thymus. The effective dose you will receive from your participation is comparable to 7 times the yearly dos e from natur al environmental radiation in the US (3.1 mSv) and withi n the limits of 50 mSV, which is set by the FDA for i ndividual s part icipating in basic research studies . Please inform your study tea m if you have been exposed to ra diation as a result of any o ther research studies or part of your clinical c are. If you pa rticipate in future studies that involve the use of r adiation, you s hould discuss it with the re searche rs performing those studies. CT Scan Dye Some of the CT scans in this study use dye in the veins ( \"cont rast\"). Some people are allergic to this dye; if you ar e, we w ill not do the study . For this reason, we will ask you about allergies to contrast or shell fish in ad vance. There is a potential risk the c ontrast dye m ay cause kidney damage , especially in peop le who alre ady have kidney problems or are dehydrated (have no t drunk enough water) . For this reason, we will check how your kidney s are working first an d will not do the test if your kidneys are not working right . Risks of Genetic Research It is po ssible that dur ing the stu dy, we may find out things about yo ur gene s. You can decide whether you want to be told about these things. T here can be a ris k in know ing these results. For example, in the future, researchers may loo k at the full set of genes in your body, inc luding look ing at the exact order of DNA. This is called whole genome sequencing. N ew information may be found that show that you have ge nes tha t make i t more likely that you will have certain health prob lems. Knowing this information can be stressful, lead t o worry and affect your relationship with y our family. There may also be benefits in knowing about genetic risks of disease; sometimes you ca n change your habits or have screening tests tha t will help you avoi d disease or treat a disease earlier. A Fede ral law, called the Genetic Information Nondis crimination Act (GINA), generally mak es it illegal for health insurance companies, group he alth pl ans, and most employers to d iscriminate against you Consent Version: 07/22/2022 Page 11 of 23 HSPP Use Only: Consent form Medical v2021-09-07 based on your ge netic information. Be aware t hat this Federal law does not protect you against genetic discrimination by companies that sell li fe insurance, disability insurance, or long -term care insuran ce. Group Ri sks Although we will not give researchers your name, we will give them basic informat ion such as your race, e thnic group, and sex. This informati on help s researchers learn whether th e factor s that lea d to health problems are the same in diffe rent g roups of people. It is possible that such findings coul d help people of the same race, ethni c group, or sex as you. H owever, they could also be used to s upport harmful stereotypes, stigmatiz e, or di scriminate against members of a socially defin ed gro up suc h as race or ethnicity . If you are Nativ e American and agree to participate in this study there may b e risks assoc iated with the research that impact your co mmunity. Health information, e specially genetic information, can be applied to m ore than j ust yo u. Genetic analysis may be able to provide information about a person's parents, siblings, c hildren, or others. Some g enetic research can produce new inf ormatio n about entire subpopulations and individual racial or ethnic groups. It is unkn own exactl y what the researchers will discover because this study invol ves unsp ecific future research. Risks may include legal, finan cial, social, or physical harm. Info rmation may be published that conflic ts with your communities' culture, traditions, cre ation stor ies, o r spiritual beliefs. What other choices do I have if I do not take part in this study ? This study does not provide tr eatment and the tests are being don e for r esearch purposes, not to provi de you with health care. You will have to seek treatme nt for COVID symptoms apart from being in this study. If you do no t take par t in this study, you can get any tests you need for COVID care from your own health care provid ers. Deciding not to be part o f the study will not affect your health care now or in the fu ture, how you pay for health care or if you can get health insurance . Your participation is vol untary. If you decide to take part in the study, you may leave the study at any time. No matter wha t decision you make, there will be no penalty to yo u and y ou wi ll not lose any of your usual benefits.
