As part of the scientic community working on novel vaccines, you are connected to a legacy that began with breakthroughs in the 18th century and continues to break the boundaries of precision medicine. Here is the story of vaccine science, a story that is still being written today.Vaccines are biologics, designed to induce an immune reaction when administered to the human body. Pathogens are killed/inactivated with heat, chemicals, or radiation before being administered to the body to provoke an immune response.They contain a simulated, inactivated, or attenuated form of a disease-causing pathogen, germ, part of a germ, or toxin in formulations that work with patients' natural immune systems to protect against future viruses and combat disease. Vaccine-originated immunity is one of the most eective ways to protect human life, yet viruses and disease-causing germs are always evolving, making the development and improvement of vaccines an ongoing and constant eort. Scholars believe an understanding of inoculations has existed for more than 2,000 years. What we know for sure is that major pandemics of smallpox, whooping cough, typhoid, and other infectious diseases across the 16th and 17th centuries led to a major surge in vaccine research from the 18th century onward. Thermo Fisher Scientic connects your viral vaccine workflow end-to-end with our trusted solutions and technology to design, develop, test, and produce your vaccine swiftly, eciently, and safely. Connect your vaccine research from discovery to commercialization and make your own mark on the story of vaccine development, with Thermo Fisher Scientic. thermosher.com/biotechvaccinesLIVE-ATTENUATED VACCINESA weakened form of the disease-causing germ is used to initiate a strong and long-term immune response within patients. TOXOID VACCINESDisease-causing toxins made by the germ are administered. This provokes an immune response to the toxins and parts of the germ that lead to disease.SUBUNIT, RECOMBINANT, POLYSACCHARIDE, AND CONJUGATE VACCINESA specic disease-causing piece of the germ like its protein, sugar, or capsid is separated out to create an immune response to that particular part. NUCLEIC ACID VACCINESDNA, plasmid, and mRNA vaccines result in the endogenous generation of viral proteins that mimic antigens produced during natural viral infection. A BRIEF HISTORY OF VACCINE ADVANCES 1853 Pasteur produces the rst rabies vaccine and introduced the term \"vaccination\" First inactive vaccine is successfully developed for diphtheria by Gaston RamonScientists discover new types pneumococcal, and meningococcal SARS-CoV-2 represents the biggest global challenge for vaccine development today Polio vaccine is invented by Jonas Salk and distributed worldwide 1923 1945 1952 1965 1970s 1995 The rst influenza vaccines are approved and produced for military use Vaccine developments include measles and smallpox, leading to the eradication of smallpox by 1980 Havrix, an inactive vaccine against hepatitis A virus, is developed and licensedEnglish doctor Edward Jenner observes milkmaids' immunity to smallpox if they already contracted cowpox 1796 Louis Pasteur produces the rst laboratory-developed vaccine to treat chicken cholera 1879 2016Measles is declared eliminated from the Americas; however, lower rates of vaccination lead to outbreaks years later 2020 1885 Vaccinations are made mandatory in the UK Target discovery Identify pathogen and conduct genetic/proteomic analysis to design vaccine. It is important to look for solutions that enable speed and accuracy and maximize throughput.Antigen identication and selection Synthesize, characterize, and optimize candidate antigens. Consider cost-eective and scalable solutions to accelerate transition from research to clinical trials and production. \u00a9 2020 Thermo Fisher Scientic Inc. All rights reserved.

Process and analytical development Identify materials, equipment, analytical methods, and process conditions that support scalable vaccine production. Consider whether you need standard or customized solutions to enable scale-up of processes.Clinical studies/trials Conduct patient testing to track success rates and help ensure vaccine safety, data integrity, and reproducibility. Look for partners who can provide rapid genotyping solutions for eective patient stratication, and who can oer global clinical trial support.Commercial production Consistent, reliable, contaminant-free development of a stable vaccine requires raw materials that meet regulatory requirements for cGMP production, and QA/QC testing.VACCINE DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES VIRAL VACCINE DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW Competitive biopharmaceutical industry Changes in the virus: genetic mutations and new strains can mean constant redevelopmentHarder to develop, standardize, and produce than other biologics New antigens require novel, complex cell substrates Vaccines have specic biochemical and biological propertiesScale-up, clinical study, trial, testing, and validation are arduous Early-phase success rate typically <10%High cost / high risk; initial outlay can exceed $1 billion over 12+ years VACCINE DEVELOPMENT MILESTONES Research and discovery Natural or synthetic antigens that could prevent or treat a disease are identied during basic lab research. These include virus-like particles, weakened viruses, bacteria, weakened bacterial toxins, or other pathogen-derived substances.Licensing 1-2 years If trials are successful, a biologics license is approved following factory inspections, labeling, and potency and purity tests by the issuing institution. Manufacture can now begin. Clinical studies/trials A proposed vaccine must be tested within the human body during Phase 1, 2, and 3 clinical trials to assess: Patient safety Immunogenicity Proposed dosage, schedule of immunizations, and method of delivery Side eects Ecacy of disease prevention, infection prevention, and antibodies producedPre-clinical studies A tissue or cell culture and animal testing phase assesses the safety and immunogenicity of a proposed vaccine. Possible human cell responses, safe dosage levels, and vaccine administration methods are also evaluated. Apply for approval After pre-clinical studies, an application will be made to regulatory bodies and the institutions responsible for authorizing clinical trials. 1 "}
