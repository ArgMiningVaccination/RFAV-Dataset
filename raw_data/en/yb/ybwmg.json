Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is an important complementary strategy for treating cancer in China. The mechanism is related to regulating the internal environment and remo deling the tumor immunosuppr essive microenvironment (TIM). Herein we illustrate how TIM is reformed and its protumor activi ty on promoting tumor cell proliferation, angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis, tumor invasion, and the oncogenicity of cancer stem cells. Furthermore we summarize the effects andmechanism of TCM on regulating TIM via enhancing antitumor immune responses (e.g., regulating the expression of MHCmolecules and Fas/FasL, attenuating cancerigenic ability of c and remolding immunosuppressive cells (e.g., reversingimmunephenotypesofTlymphocytesandtumorassociatedmacrophages,promotingdendriticcellsmature,restraining myeloid derived suppressor cells function, and regulating Th1/Th2 factors). We also reveal the bidirectional and multitargetingfunctions of TCM on regulating TIM. Hopefully, it provides new theoretical basis for TCM clinical practice in cancer treatment andprevention. 1. Introduction Chronic inflammation and immune suppression are the two core characteristics of the tumor microenvironment. It hasbeen proven that chronic inflammation plays an importantrole in tumorigenesis and development; for instance inflam-matory large intestine disease leads to colorectal cancer, H. Pylori infection breeds gastric cancer, and hepatitis B and C virus infection causes hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).However,immunecellsintumormicroenvironmentpromote tumor progression on the other hand: they constitute tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment (TIM) and alleviatetumorimmuneescapeandtumorigenesis.Harmfulstimulat- ingfactorssuchashypoxia,acidenvironment,hyperosmosis, and inflammatory cytokines in tumor microenvironmentfacilitate the formation of TIM. According to the theoryof tumor immunoediting, in TIM released tumor cellsand immunosuppressive factors remodel the phenotype of immunecells,whichdecreasesitsantitumorfunction;mean-while,remodeledimmunecells\"resculpture\"tumorcellsandmakethembecomeoflowimmunogenicityandmightfavorimmune escape of tumor cells [ 1,2]. Besides these, immune suppressive cells in TIM also bring out angiogenesis andlymphangiogenesis,playingavitalroleintumordevelopmentandmetastasis.Thus,TIMisconsideredasanoveltargetforcancertreatment. TraditionalChinesemedicine(TCM)isaveryimportant tumor treatment strategy in China [ 3]. It is accepted that TCMcanreducethetoxicityofchemotherapyandradiother-apy,enhancetheantitumoreffectofthesetherapies,alleviate tumor-inducedclinicalsymptomsandcancerpains,andpro- longthesurvivaltimeofpostoperationalandadvancedstagecancerpatients[ 4].ThoughtheeffectmechanismofTCMis not very clear, increasing data has shown that it may relate Hindawi Publishing Corporation BioMed Research International Volume 2015, Article 12 pages http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2015/2616202 BioMedResearchInternational withitsactiononregulatingtumorimmuneenvironment,the noveltargetaccordingtothetheoryofimmunoediting[ 5,6]. Inthispaper,wewillintroducetheformationandfunctionofTIMandsummarizerecentresearchesofTCMonregulatingit. Tumor Immunosuppressive Microenvironment Tumormicroenvironmentisacomplexcompound,including tumor cells, stromal cells, extracellular matrix, cellular fac-tors,andchemokines.Themicroenvironmentplaysapivotalrole in the process of cancer development and metastasis.Downregulating the immune function and combined withextracellularmatrixproteinsandmatrix-degradingenzymes,stromalcells(e.g.,angiogeniccells,immunecells,andtumorassociatedfibroblasts)andcellfactorstheyproducedencom-pass tumor cells and form the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment[ 7]. In TIM, tumor cells do not express classical MHC I molecules but express nonclassical MHC molecules, leading totheimmunosuppressionandtumorprogression[ 8].Mean- while, tumor cells express a variety of immunosuppressive factors, such as IL-10, IL-6, and TGF- ,r e v e r s i n gi m m u n e cellstoimmunosuppressivephenotypes,forexample,regula- toryTcells,regulatoryBcells,tumorassociatedmacrophages(TAMs), regulatory dendritic cells, and myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). These immunosuppressive cells interact with each other and increasingly proliferate andexpress immunosuppressive and protumor factors. More- over, they (IL-2, TNF- promote and vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF)as well, promoting angiogenesis and tumor invasion [ 9-12]. All these tumorigenesis responses give negative feedback toimmunocytes,breedingaviciouscirclefortumortreating. 3. Immune Suppressive Cells in TIM Promote Tumorigenesis and Progression 3.1. Promoting Tumor Cell Proliferation. Studies have proven the close relationship between TIM and tumorigenesis in different kinds of cancer diseases [ 13,14]. When turning to basic researches, Fritz et al. [ 15] found that macrophages produce IGF-1 which directly stimulates through Erk Munari etal. [16] demonstrated that gastric lymphoma-infiltrating macrophages highly produced APRIL, which was regardedas a novel cytokine crucial in sustaining B cell proliferationa n dc a u s i n gam u c o s aa s s o c i a t e dl y m p h o i dt i s s u eBc e l llymphoma proliferation. When coculturing with breast can-cercells,IL-4-activatedmacrophagetransportedmicroRNAsfrom itself to breast cancer cells, and one of microRNAs,miR-223,promotedtheinvasionofbreastcancercellsviatheMef2c--catenin pathway [ 17]. These studies conclude andinside provide evidences that immune suppressive cells in TIMpromotetumorcellsmultiplication. 3.2. Promoting Angiogenesis and Lymphangiogenesis. Tumor hematal and lymphatic vessels are important in tumor pro-gression and serve as paths and tubes for nutrients andmetabolites transportation, promoting tumor cells growthandmetastasis.TIMplaysavitalroleintheprocessofangio-genesis and lymphangiogenesis. In tumor hypoxic microen-vironment,tumorcells,tumorassociatedmacrophages,den-dritic cells, myeloid neutrophilcellssecreteavarietyofproangiogenesisandprolymphangio-genesis lymphatic in tumortissuesundercertainconditions[ 21].Thereby,TIMisdirectly involvedintheformationofvesselsintumors. 3.3.PromotingTumorInvasion. Theinvasiveabilityoftumor cells is the basis of tumor local invasion and distant metas- tasis, and prior to this is the remolding of the extracellularm a t r i x .T A M ,Th - 1 7c e l l s ,a n dD C si nT I Mp r o d u c eM M P sandTGF-todissolveextracellularcollagens,soastoremold the extracellular matrix. TAMs used both the mesenchy-mal mode requiring MMPs and the amoeboid migrationmode to infiltrate tumor cell spheroids and promote MMP-independent invasion by tumor cells [ 22]. Epithelial mes- enchymal transition (EMT) is the morphological changep r o c e s so ft u m o rc e l l si n v a s i o na n dm e t a s t a s i s[ 23]. TAMs could mediate EMT of tumor cells and promote the tumorprogressionthroughtheTLR4/IL-10signalingpathway[ 24]. By activating TGF-,E G F ,a n dH G Fs i g n a l i n gp a t h w a y , MDSCs induced EMT as well [ 25]. Hence, TIM makes it easier for tumor invasion via both affecting it straightly andmediatingEMT. 3.4. Promoting the Oncogenicity of Cancer Stem Cell. Cancer stem-like cell (CSC) is a hotspot of the tumor research inrecentyears.ItiswidelythoughtthatCSCisatumorigenesisand metastasis \"seed cell\" and the \"springhead\" of tumor immune escape. CSC has a continuous self-renewal and proliferationability,anditdifferentiatesincompletely,resist-ing radiation and chemotherapy and producing immunesuppressive factors. Losing normal exogenous apoptosissignaling pathways, CSC strongly shows the resistance toapoptosis functions [ 26,27]. Immune suppressive cells in TIM also participate in regulating CSC function. Yang etal. [28] found that TAMs mediate tumorigenesis through regulationofbreastCSCsandpromoteCSC-likephenotypesinmurinebreastcancercellsbyupregulatingtheirexpressionof Sox-2. TAM markers are associated with cancer stem cellmarker in oral squamous cell carcinoma [ 29]. MDSCs had similar features that triggered microRNA101 expression inBioMedResearchInternational 3 MMPs/VEGF/hypoxia Blood vessel Tumor cell B cell Mature DCLymphatic vessel Tumor stem-like cell Regulatory B cell Regulatory DCExtracellular matrix (ECM) Inflammatory T cell M1macrophage Figure1). The hypoxia environment brings TIM increasingly pro- ducing immune suppressive and angiogenesis factors (e.g.,I L - 6 ,I L - 1 0 ,T G F -, MMPs, and VEGF) and downregulating inflammatory cytokines such suppressive and causes progressionandmetastasis. 4. TCM Enhances Tumor Immune Responses 4.1. TCM Promotes Classic MHC Molecules Expression.MHC,alsocalledhumanleukocyteantigen(HLA)inhumantissues,istheimportantimmunologicalrecognitionmoleculein the process of tumor immune response. Classic MHCmolecule can be divided into two subgroups: MHC class I and MHC class II. MHC I have a vital role in presenting tumorantigenstoTcellreceptor.Afteridentifyingthetumorantigen peptide and MHC class I molecule, the cytotoxicT cell (CTL) is activated and launched a series of cytolysisreactionstokilltumorcells.MHCIIpresentstumorantigensto CD4 +T helper cells, leading to cellular mediated immune r e s p o n s e .H o w e v e r ,b o t hi m m u n ea n dm a l i g n a n tc e l l si nthe tumor microenvironment do not express typical MHCmolecules.TheydownregulateMHCclassIexpression,over-expressnonclassicalHLAsuchasHLA-G,HLA-E,andHLA-F,whichhavebeenrecentlyproventobecorrelatedwithpoorclinical outcome, and escape from T and NK cell-mediatedrecognition[ shown that TCM can upregulate MHC tion (ISD) (Radix Codonopsis, Poria,R h i z o m aA t r a c t y l o d i s H C molecules in the rat liver cancer tissue and found that ISD c o u l de n h a n c et h ee x p r e s s i o no fM H CIa n dM H CI Ia n d prolong the rat survival time. Besides the effects on tumor cells, TCM could also increase MHC expression in immunecells.Anoectochilus formosanus is a medicinal herb in Asia and extracts of A. formosanus havebeenreportedtopossess antitumoractivities.Kuanetal.[ 33]foundthat A.formosanus could stimulate the MHC II l b u s Fritillariae Cirrhosae) could upregulate the expression of MHC II of dendritic cells and improve the body function of antitumor immunological surveillance [ 34]. These results suggest that TCM could enhance tumor antigen-presentingabilitybyupregulatingclassicMHCexpressioninbothtumorandimmunecells. 4.2. TCM Induces Tumor Cells Apoptosis via Fas/FasL on cellular membranes. The activation of Fas/FasL path-way plays an important role in cell apoptosis. Physio- logically, cytotoxic T lymphocytes (Fas lowFasLhigh) express FasL and combine with the Fas expressed by target cells (FashighFasLlow),resultinginthetrimerizationandactivation of the Fas receptor, and then mediate target cells apoptosis.4 BioMedResearchInternational Unlikenormaltargetcells,tumorcellsexpressnonfunctional Fas or low quantity of Fas; meanwhile overexpression ofFasL promotes tumor cells immune escape by preventingthe combination with cytotoxic T cells and induces CTLapoptosis[ 35]. Our previous study showed that TCM herbal downregulate Fas expressioninTlymphocytesofgastriccancerpatients,which indicates YWKLF may inhibit cancer by inducing apoptosis [36]. Our subsequent studies established MGC-803 stomach cancercellmodelinvitroandshowedFasLmRNAinMGC-803 declined significantly after treatment by YWKL [ 37]. These mean YWKL may enhance cancer cells' sensitivity to immune response cells like CTL and lead to tumor cells apoptosisbyregulatingFas/FasLpathway. 4.3. TCM Attenuates Oncogenicity of CSCs. Cancer stem- like cells (CSCs) are a more malignant composition in tumor tissues inhibiting immune response. Researches have demonstrated CSCs take part in carcinogenesis and therapy resistance in kinds of tumors [ 38-41]. CSCs rarely express immune recognition molecules such as HLA-DR and cos- timulatorymoleculessuchasCD80andCD86.Furthermore, laboratoryresearchesshowCSCtumorsphereslowlyexpress Fas and highly express membrane complement regulatory proteins and FoxP3 [ 42]. All stem celldifferentiation and found Bufalin inhibited the proliferationand sphere formation of cancer stem cells. Zhang et al. [ 44] Further study revealed Huaier extract downregulated the Wnt/-catenin pathway, which is one o ft h ec r i t i c a lp a t h w a y sd e m o n s t r a t e dt om e d i a t et h es e l f -renewal of CSCs. Honokiol is an extract from that it canthwarttumorgrowth[ 45]. Ponnurangam et al. [46] found the ability of Honokiol to enhance the sensitivity of colon CSCs to ionizing radiation is by inhibiting the - secretase complex and the Notch signaling pathway. Thesefindings indicate that Chinese medicine may reduce CSCsandweakentumorimmuneresistanceaswell( Figure2). WhilebeingtreatedbyChinesemedicine,thepercentage of CSCs is decreased; Classic MHC and molecules areexpressed more on tumor cytomembranes, which lead totumor cells having lower malignant degree and easier to berecognizedandkilledbytheimmunesystem.Tumor and Regulates the Antitumor Functions of Immune Cells Immune cells show various functions and phenotypes and play multiple roles in antitumor immunity and protumori-genesis, which are determined and influenced by tumorimmune microenvironment. TCM herbs indicate a biphasicregulation on to enhance antitumorimmune responses: increasing phenotypicantitumor +CD8+), helper T cells (CD3+CD4+), and regulatory T cells(CD3+CD4+CD25+).CD4+TcellsproduceIL-2andIL- 15 which enhance the activation of CD8+T cells, maintain the activity of CTL, and also activate innate immune cells suchasnaturalkillcellsanddendriticcells.Meanwhile,part of CD4+T cells has the ability to kill tumor cells directly. CD8+Tcellsreleaseperforinandparticleenzymestokilland dissolvetumorcellsandleadtotargetcellsapoptosisthroughFas/FasL pathway. CD4 +CD25+Tc e l l( T r e g )i sa ni m m u n e regulating subtype which is regarded to play immunosup-pressive role in tumor microenvironment. Tregs produce quantity of immune suppressive factors, for example, IL-10 and TGF-, compete with response T cells for consuming IL-2, affect metabolism of other T cells, and downregulatethe stimulation of dendritic cells [ 48]. Thus, it is the key to regulating tumor immune microenvironment via enhancingantitumor efficacy of T cells and inhibiting Treg cell and itsfunction. It is notable that TCM may adjust immune function by targeting regulating immune cellsinTIM. andGanoderma ) is an antitumor compound prescription of TCM,whichhasbeenproveneffectiveintheclinicalresearch[49]. Recent study in Lewis lung carcinoma bearing mice model showed FYN's effect on Tregs. It was found that thenumbersofCD4 +CD25+regulatoryTcellsinspleen,thymus, and tumor were lower in the FYN group than in the modelgroup(<0.05).TheexpressionofFoxp3mRNAinspleen, thymus, and tumor was also significantly downregulated inthe FYN group [ 50]. There are other studies that showed main ingredients of FYN such as Astragaloside significantlyincreased IL-2 and IFN-secretion of M1/M2 occupy about 30%-50% of the totaltumor stroma cells. After being recruited to the tumormicroenvironment, TAMs differentiate into two polarizedphenotypes, that is, the classic activation polarization (M1phenotype) and the alternative activation polarization (M2phenotype). Induced by IFN- ,I L - 6 ,a n ds of o r t h ,M 1 macrophages display proinflammatory, antigen-presenting,and antitumor effects, through release of soluble enzyme,TNF, and IFN and activation of T cell immune responses to inhibit tumor cells. However, M2 macrophages, activatedby IL-10, IL-13, and so forth, have an immune regulatinga n ds u p p r e s s i v er o l ev i am u l t i p l ew a y st op r o m o t et u m o rprogression. Recent studies indicated TAMs tend to M2protumorphenotypethroughstimulatingtumorcellprolifer- ation,inhibitingtumorimmunemicroenvironment,promot- ing matrix remodeling, and accelerating angiogenesis andlymphangiogenesis [ 52,53]. Thus, TAMs are associated with tumorprogressionandmetastasis. Researchers reported TCM herbs could inhibit macrophages'inflammatoryeffect[ 54],andtherearecertain studies that showed switch the phenotype of TAMsfromM2toM1duringtumorprogression. Schisandra polysaccharide (SCPP11) is an extract ingredient from herb medicine Schisandra chinensis ,w h i c hh a sb e e nu s e di n TCM for centuries and proved to have antitumor activities.Recent study results showed that SCPP11 could increase the pinocyticactivityofperitonealmacrophagesinCTX-induced immunosuppression mice. Moreover, SCPP11 significantly increased immunoglobulin levels and cytokines levels in vivo and induced RAW264.7 cells (a monocyte/macrophagecelllineofmiceforinvitroexperiments)tosecretecytokines in vitro and RAW264.7 cells pretreated with SCPP11 significantly inhibited the proliferation of HepG-2 cells, viapromoting the expression of both iNOS protein and iNOSand TNF-mRNA [55]. These results showed that of macrophages. Otherresearchersfoundfiveextracts(UM01,QH11,BNQM,GNCC,andDCXC)of and MAPK signaling S180 IL-10and TGF-expression and raised the ratio of iNOS/Arg1 which represents the M1/M2 proportion. All the findingsaboveillustrateChinesemedicinalherbscouldinhibittumorcells cells (DCs) are professional antigen- presenting cells, which activate initial T cell by presentinganddeliveringantigensandmediateacquiredtumorimmunecytotoxicity.However,recentstudiesfoundasubsetofDCsin6 BioMedResearchInternational the tumor microenvironment inducing immunosuppression called regulatory DCs or tumor associated DCs (TADCs).TheseTADCshavealowabilitytopresentantigen,induceTcellsdifferentiatingtoTregsubtype,andconsequentlyimpair T cell-mediated tumor killing effects. Furthermore, TADCs lead to a decreasing ratio of Th cells and effective T cells apoptosisthroughawaysuchasreactiveoxygenspecies,the indoleamine 2, 3-2 oxidase (IDO), and releasing immune suppressive factors [ 59]. TADCs are also involved in tumor angiogenesis, tumor cell proliferation, and invasion [ 60]. Thus, we can see from above that DCs have a similar polar- izationlikemacrophages(M1/M2).Regulatingdendriticcells and enhancing their antigen-presenting function could be a possiblewayforTCMantitumoreffects. Zhang and Liu found that TCM with function of sup- plementing Pi and nourishing Shen could improve theinflammatory function of DCs in patients with chronichepatitis B [ 61]. Our laboratory group explored the possible influenceofTCMdrugFLPonregulatingDCsinperipheralblood, spleen, and tumor in mice with transplanted Lewislung cancer. We found that the percentages of DCs (perthousand) in tumor bearing mice were increased to 2.55 \u00b1 0.29 in peripheral blood and 2.70 \u00b10.63 in spleen (< 0.01) after FLP treatment [ 62]. Further studies showed FLP promotedDCsmaturity,reversedDCsregulatory(immuno-suppressive)phenotype,andincreasedDCsmembraneMHC II, CD80, CD83, CD86, and CD40 expression. FLP also p r o m o t e dt h eI L - 1 2s e c r e t i o no fD C sa n de n h a n c e dt h efunction of DC-LPAK tumor killing way [ 34,63]. These TCM Restrains Myeloid Derived Suppressor Cells (MDSCs). Myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are a special kind of cell population which play essential role in malignant tumor immune suppression. The main immuneinhibition effects of MDSCs reflect on suppressing T cells relatedimmuneresponsesandinducingTcellapoptosis,pro- motinginflammatorymediatedtumorrecurrenceandmetas- tasis. MDSCs a group of heterogeneous ingimmaturemacrophages,dendriticcells,andgranulocytes. Pathological stimulations like malignant tumor and inflam-mation block immature bone marrow cells differentiation into mature cells, leading to the expansion of MDSCs andc o n t r i b u t i n gt ot h en e g a t i v er e g u l a t i o no ft u m o ri m m u n eresponse. MDSCs facilitate angiogenesis by releasing VEGF, MMPs, TGF-, and so forth and inhibiting T cell-mediated tumor acquired immune responses with overexpression ofA r g 1 ,i N O S ,R o s ,a n ds of o rt h .Th ei n c r e a s i n gI L - 1 0p r o d u c -tivity of MDSCs restricts macrophages and DCs antitumorfunctionaswell[ 64]. Since 2007, we established the collaboration with the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Molecular Immunoregu-lation Laboratory and carried out series studies on theimmune regulation effect of TCM. The results showedTCM herbs Radix phenotype and pro-tumor functions [ 65]. Our recent studies found that the levels of MDSCs in breast cancer patient peripheral bloodare positively associated with tumor progression and SGJP enhanced and regulated inflammatoryfunctions of NKT cells, which were associated with MDSCs regulation [ 66]. These above were addressed by Jak-Stats signalpathwaysandindicatedTCMherbsaffectingMDSCs. 5.5. , INF-,a r el i n k e d toproinflammation,cytotoxicandcytophagicenhancement,and other antitumor functions, while Th2 factors, for exam- ple, yasu r essiv er oleint umo r immune microenvironment and promote tumor recurrence andmetastasis. Wei et al. [ 67,68]f o u n dt h a tT C Mh e r bRa d i xA s t r a g a l i (AG) and tetramethylpyrazine (TTMP) extracted from amedicinal herb Ligusticum chuanxiong could reverse pre- dominance of Th2 cytokines in lung cancer patients. AG enhanced the levels of Th1 cytokine (IFN- and IL-2) as well as its transcript factor (T-bet) expression in culture supernatant and reduced those of Th2 cytokines in cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of lung cancerpatients. TTMP could enhance supernatant concentration and gene expression levels of IFN- ,I L - 2 ,a n dT - b e tb u t reduce those of type 2 cytokines (e.g., IL-4, IL-10). These results demonstrated that AG and TTMP could reverse the type 2 dominant status, which might offer an alternativetherapeutic regime for lung cancer patients. Other stud- ies of TCM compound decoctions, containing Astragalus composition, showed and TNF- in vivo [69] .W a n ga n dC h e n[ 70] observed the expression of Th1/Th2 transcriptionfactors and cytokines in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC)during radiotherapy.

Concretely, inflammatory T cells and NKT cells increasingly proliferate in contrastto the reducing quantity of regulatory T cells and MDSCs.

Difference between TCM and Modern Western Medicine in Cancer Immunotherapy 6.1.TCMHasMultitargetandBidirectionalImmunoregulation Effect.B a s e do nt h ep r e l i m i n a r ys t u d i e s ,t h em u l t i t a r g e t function of TCM compound on regulating TIM is assignedto its multicomponents. First, the compound is usuallycomposed of more than one herb, and the herb oftenconsists of various ingredients and each ingredient alwayscontainsdifferentkindsofchemicals.Therearesomecertainchemicals extracted from TCM herbs that are found tohave immune regulating function: specifically, (G. lucidum ),which haslongbeenprescribedtopreventandtreatvarioushumandiseases, particularly in China, Japan, and Korea. Someresearches showed that GLPS had a potential role in cancertreatment;furtherstudiessuggestedthattheantitumoractiv-ities of GLPS are mediated by its immunoregulation effect.GLPS might act on immune-related cells as well as immune cells such as B lymphocytes, T lymphocytes, dendritic cells, macrophages, and natural killer cells [ 71].Solanum nigrum Linn., another effective TCM herb in cancer treatment, hasbeen proven to have antitumor activity by enhancing theCD4 immunoregulating role. Bae et al. [ 73]f o u n dt h a t , after oral administration of BST204, a purified ginseng dryextract containing ginsenosides such as Rg1 and Rh1, only the S epimers, S-Rh2 and S-Rg3, could be determined in rat plasma. Studies also found that the oral bioavailability ofginsenoside Rg1 is very low in rats and ginsenosides mightbe metabolized by intestinal microflora before absorptioninto blood [ 74,75]. These indicated that some ingredients in TCM herbs might be effective after being metabolizedor some of the chemicals inactive in vitro could play rolesin organisms after being metabolized. Continuing in depthstudies, metabolite of ginsenosides compound K was foundin suppressing the activation of the NF- Bp a t h w a ya n d metastatic prostate cancer combined with docetaxel and was more effective than its prototype [ 77]. TCM herbs such as ginsenghavebeenprovedtohaveimmuneenhancement,andit is a possible hypothesis that their metabolites modulateimmunemicroenvironments. As mentioned above, due to its complicated ingredients TCMcompoundhasamultitargeteffect.Itmightactdirectlyon various immune cells, while it can also play a rolethrough regulating immune factors in different immunesignalpathways[ 78].AnotherimportantfeatureofTCMisits bidirectional effect. For instance, Radix Astragali has effectsonbothneoplasms(immuneenhancement)andrheumatoidarthritis (immune suppression) [ 79,80]. In addition, TIM brings out abnormal expression of signal pathways andcytokines;meanwhiletheratiooffunction-oppositeimmunecell phenotypes such as M1/M2 macrophages is also imbal-ancedinTIM,whichiscalleddisharmonyaccordingtoTCMtheory. TCM always affect multiple targets, and they couldappropriately reverse an unbalanced state (immunologicderangementinTIM)toarelativeharmonystate. 6.2. Western Medicine Acts as Guided Missiles in Cancer Immunotherapy. The characteristic of Western medicine is focused on definite targets that means Western medicinehas specific targets relatively visualized and detectable, justlike a guided missile hit a target with a minimal error.These immunotherapies are guided into the following fields:(1) monoclonal antibodies against either tumor cells (beva-cizumab [ other targets vaccines; (3) immune cells adoptive treatment, suchas CIK [88]; (4) soluble tumor virus gene therapy [ 89], such as GC0070 and GL-ONC1. These indicate the convinced evidences and targets of Western medicine immunotherapy,but there are some problems and side effects, such as thedermatologiceventsassociatedwithcixutumumab[ 90]. To make up for deficiencies of Western medicine speci- ficity,itisfeasibletointroduceTCMinmodernimmunother-apies, such as the immune enhancement and side effectsremission [ 91,92]. Above all, it is benefit to patients that we combine the Western medicine (specificity) with TCM(multitarget and bidirectional regulating) in immunothera-pies, and there is a promising field waiting us to study andexplore. 7. Summary TCM plays an important role in cancer treatment in China via diversity ways ( Figure4). The formation and dynamic changesofTIMareamultifacetedprocessandareincluding multiple targets, different types of cells, and various signal pathways. Here we maintain that the TCM, both monomerand compound, has a certain effect on regulating TIM, and ways and points the TCM is affecting are diverse. More specifically, TCM herbs influenced not only tumor cells, but immune cells and cytokines as well as signal analysis of these TCM herbs, we c a ns e eR a d i xC o d o n o p s i s ,R a d i xG i n s e n g ,R a d i xA s t r a g a forth exist inkindsofTCMcompounddecoctions,whichhavedifferentrolesinregulatingTIM;thatistosaysomeofTCMherbsmayhave multiple effect on TIM.
