A related report is set out. Much of Public Law 100-418 is derived from H.R. 3, the predecessor bill vetoed by President Reagan on May 24, 1988, primarily because of the inclusion of a subtitle requiring employers to provide employees with notice of plant closings and mass layoffs; that subtitle has been separated from Public Law 100- 418 (s ee Pub.L. 100-379). The conference report to accompany H.R. 3 is to be 442a treated as the legislative history to accompany Public Law 100-418 (see section 2 of Public Law 100-418 for applicabilit y and exceptions). The conference report to accompany H.R. 3 (H.R. Rep. No. 100-576, Apr. 20, 1988) is set out. (CONSULT NOTE FOLLOWING TEXT FOR INFORMATION ABOUT OMITTED MATERIAL. EACH COMMITTEE REPORT IS A SEPARATE DOCUMENT ON WESTLAW.) HOUSE CONFERENCE REPORT NO. 100-576 April 20, 1988 * * * * * JOINT EXPLANATORY STATEMENT OF THE COMMITTEE OF CONFERENCE The managers on the part of the House and the Senate at the conference on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 3) to enhance the competitiveness of American industry, and for other purposes, submit the following joint statement to the House and the Senate in explanation of the effect of the action agreed upon by the managers and recommended in the accompanying conference report: The Senate amendment struck out all of the House bill after the enacting clause and inserted a substitute text. The House recedes from its disagreement to the amendment of the Senate with an amendment which is a substitute for the House bill and the Senate amendment. The differences between the House bill, the Senate amendment, and the substitute agreed to 443a in conference are noted below, except for clerical corrections, conforming changes made necessary by agreements reached by the conferees, and minor drafting and clarifying changes. The conferees agreed to the House and Senate provisions. 2. INFRINGEMENT LIABILITY (SEC. 1403 OF HOUSE BILL; SEC. 3302 OF SENATE AMENDMENT) Present law No provision. House bill Provides that using, selling or importing a product made in violation of a U.S. process patent is an act of patent-infringem ent. Limits remedies against mere users or retailers by requiring exhaustion of remedies against importers and non- retailer sellers. Liability is further limited by excluding products which have been materially changed by subsequent proces ses or if the product is a minor or nonessential component of another product. Senate bill Similar to House bill in that it provides that using, selling or import ing a product made in violation of a U.S. process pa tent is an act of patent- infringement. Limits reme dies against mere users (for non-commercial use) or retailers by requiring exhaustion of remedies against importers and non- retailer sellers. Liability is further limited by excluding products which have been materially 444a changed by subsequent proces ses or if the product is a trivial and nonessential component of another product. Conference agreement House recedes to the Senate on both \"non- commercial use\" and \"trivial and\" amendments. As to the former, the House recession implies that exhaustion of other remedies must occur before recourse is made against a non-commercial user. It should be noted that many of the \"products\" produced by patented pr ocesses are themselves \"used\" in the manufacture of another product which is introduced into comm erce. Consider a process patent held on a method for preparing a plasmid or other vector. The use of the plasmid or vector to insert a new gene into a living cell, instructing the cell to produce an important human protein (such as insulin or interferon) which will then be separated from the fermentation mash, purified, and packaged into single dosage forms, is a commercial use and is ineligible for the limited protection granted to non-commercial uses. The field of biotechnology is particularly susceptible to commercial \"users\" without sales. For example, a patent may cover a process for producing a microorganism using recombinant DNA technology. The microganism is then used to produce a pa rticular commercial end- product of great value. The bill's provisions limiting remedies against users are not intended to apply to such commercial uses. The Committee believes that without expeditious remedies against use-based infringement, merely stopping non-retail sale of the 445a microorganism after its entry into the country fails to prevent commercial use of the microorganism. In the biotechnology field it is well known that all living organisms contai n within them particular genetic sequences composed of unique structural characteristics. The patent ed process may be for the process of preparing a DNA molecule comprising a specific genetic sequence . A foreign manufacturer uses the patented proc ess to prepare the DNA molecule which is the product of the patented process. The foreign manufacturer inserts the DNA molecule into a plasmid or other vector and the plasmid or other vector containing the DNA molecule is, in turn, inserted into a host organism; for example, a bacterium. The plasmid-containing host organism still containing the specific genetic sequence expresses that sequence to produce the desired polypeptide. Even if a diff erent organism was created by this biotech procedure, if it would not have been possible or Requires the Secretary of Transportation to solicit the views of the Department of Commerce and the United States Trade Representative in addition to the Department of State before taking action on a complaint. Senate amendment Identical to House bill. Conference agreement House bill 4. Present law Does not require reports to Congressional Committees on actions taken on a complaint. 446a House bill Requires the Secretary of Transportation to report within 30 days of taking action on a complaint to the House Committee on Public Works and Transportation and the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation on what actions have been taken. Senate amendment Requires the same reports as the House bill, except that the Secretary does not have to report if the complaint is withdrawn before the 30th day.

No. 576, STATES ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY WASHINGTON, DC 20460 OFFICE OF PREVENTION, PESTICIDES AND TOXIC SUBSTANCES AUG 3 2005 Mr. Warren Stickle, President Chemical Produc ers & Distributors Association P.O. Box 25793 Alexandria, VA 22313 Dear Mr. Stickle: Thank you for your letter of July 11, expressing your concern about the potential impacts of the court's recent decision in FMC Corp. v. Control Solutions, Inc. I share your concern abo ut the potential impacts on EPA's Pesticide Program for the following program policy reasons. First, it must be stressed that the pesticide label is an important part of the federally approved registration that provides necessary information and directions to users regarding the pesticide and how the pesticide must be used . The label also is an important element in EPA's analysis of whether a pesticide can be used wi thout causing unreasonable adverse effects to human health and the environment. Accordingly, it is important for the protection of the environment and public health that products that are similar and ill tend ed for similar uses have clear and 481a consistent labeling. It ha s been the practice of the Office of Pesticide Programs since the enactment of FIFRA section 3(c)(7)(A) in 1978 to strongly encourage \"me-too\" product l abels to be identical or substantially similar to the labels of the products on which their registrations are based. When they are not, OPP may be unable to conclude that products meet the FIFRA section 3(c)(7)(A) standard for issuing \"me-too\" registrations. Thus, this is not merely a matter of convenience for OPP. Similar products need to communicate use instructions and warnings in a clear and cons istent fashion to ensure that the products are used appropriately. Conveying application in structions and safety messages for similar produc ts in different ways increases the likelihood th at the product will be misused. It also diminishes the Agency's ability to enforce pesticide labeling in a consistent manner and thus defeats the primary pu rpose of the labeling. For example, precautionary language on mosquito control products, which is intended to manage risks to aquatic life, has varied co nsiderably from product to product, causing confus ion' among users and enforcement personnel. The Agency recently issued a Pesticide Registration Notice (PR Notice 2005-1), which recommends consistent environmental hazard label statements. The recommended language will help achieve the objective of effective mosquito control while protecting water and aquatic life. Second, if the FMC v. CSI decision stands, EPA's Pesticide Program would likely be inundated with applications to amen d thousands of \"me-too\" labels as their registrants endeavor to avoid potential copyright infringement clai ms. It is difficult to 482a imagine how many differen t ways companies might come up with to convey the same information, and it is equally hard to imagine the amount of staff time that would be required to conduct a detailed review of each label. For example, there are over 650 2,4-D products, the majority of which are \"me-toos\". It is simply not reasonable to expect that each label could be sufficiently different from all others to avoid copyright infringement and yet ensure that users will not be confused. Users are bo und to be confused if all of the these products' labels convey their instructions for use in different ways. And, as you have pointed out, amendments to \"me-too\" labels are not subject to the payment of fees under the Pesticide Registration Improvement Act, but we are required by law to complete those reviews within 90 days. These applications would require us to devote significant resources to activities that are essentially administrative and do not enhance environmental protection. The result would be a major diversion of resources that would undermi ne our ability to protect human health and the environment. We are continuing to analyze the FMC decision as we keep abreast of pending litigation on this issue. We are grateful that you have shared your own analysis with us. Sincerely, /s/ Susan B. Hazen Principal Deputy Assistant Administrator 483a IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE MIDDLE DISTRICT OF NORTH CAROLINA BASF AGROCHEMICAL PRODUCTS B.V. et al. Plaintiffs, v. MAKHTESHIM AGAN OF NORTH AMERICA, INC., et al. Defendants. Civil Action No. 06-CV-536 DECLARATION OF LOIS ROSSI I, Lois Rossi, am over 18 years of age, and I am competent to be a witness in this proceeding. I give this Declaration based on my own personal knowledge or on a review of information contained in the records of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\" or\" Agency\") or supplied by current EPA employees under my supervision. 1. I currently serve as Director of the Registration Division in the Office of Pesticide Programs (\"OPP\") at the EPA, a position I have held since December 2003. My office is located at One Potomac Yard, 2777 S. Crystal Drive, Arlington, VA, 22202. 2. Before serving in my current role, I held numerous staff and managerial positions in OPP beginning in 1978, including serving as a Product Manager in the Registration Division. In both my role as Registration Division Director and as a Product Manager, I have overseen and been involved in the 484a process of approving pest icide produc t labeling pursuant to section 3 of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (\"FIFRA\"). Also, in my role as a Branch Chief in and Director of the Special Review and Reregistration Division, I was involved in generating and reviewing proposed label language for registered pesticides to miti gate risks identified in the FIFRA section 4 reregistration process. 3. A pesticide registration is an EPA permit that allows registrants to sell and distribute pesticides in the United States. The requirements for registering pesticides und er FIFRA are found in section 3 of that Act. Section 3(c)(5) requires the Agency to determine, among other things, that the pesticide, when used in accordance with widespread and commonly recognized practices, will not cause unreasonable adverse effects to human health and the environment and that pesticide product labeling complies with the provisions of FIFRA. 4. In evaluating pe sticide applications, the Agency requires all regist rants to submit, or offer compensation for, a significa nt body of toxicity and exposure data and to submit proposed labeling for pesticides for which they are seeking registration. EPA reviews the submitted da ta and conducts a risk assessment for each pesticide. EPA then uses that risk assessment, together with consideration of the benefits of the pesticide, to determine, consistent with the FIFRA standard, the appropriate terms and conditions for registration of that pesticide. 5. The EPA-approved labeling is an integral part of the federally approved registration. It is the primary means through which EPA establishes and enforces the terms of the registration and 485a regulates the use of the pesticide. Indeed, it is a violation of FIFRA to use a registered pesticide in a manner inconsistent with the EPA-approved labeling. A pesticide label sets forth the lawful conditions of use for a pesticide in order to ensure that the pesticide will not cause unreasonable adverse effects to human health and the environment. EPA must, therefore, carefully review product labeling to ensure that the directions are clear, cap able of being followed and enforceable, and that, when followed, product use will be consistent with the FIFRA standard. 6. Many components of the label are circumscribed by EPA regulations and policy; however, the majority of conditions for use of a pesticide are determined by EPA on a pesticide-by-pesticide basis. This is because of the enormous variety in the nature of pesticides, their use sites, and the pests they are designed to control. As part of this process, EPA reviews the considerable toxicity an d exposure data that are required to be submitted to EPA by all pesticide registrants. Evaluating thes e data and determining the appropriate conditions of us e to ensure the pesticide meets the FIFRA standard requires extensive EPA review and involvement and results, in most cases, in significant revisions to th e initial proposed label submitted by an applicant for registration. 7. Indeed, it is the development of the pesticide database. the revi ew of that data, the risk assessment, and the subsequent establishment of the conditions for use of the pesticide that involve the most significant use of registrant and Agency resources. The labeling instructions are simply the mechanism through which the EPA-approved conditions of use are expresse d. For example, if it is 486a necessary to ensure that a pesticide does not get into water because it may kill fish and other aquatic organisms, the Agency might require that a no-use buffer zone around lakes, rivers, and streams be imposed before approving a registration for the pesticide. It is the determination that a buffer is needed-and the size of that buffer- that will involve significant time and effort. Although it is critical that the label language putting that registration condition in place be as clear and understandable to users as possible, crafting the actual language is largely a mechanistic process of modifying similar language already found on hundreds of existing pesticide labels to fit the particular conditions of use for the pesticide. 8. Under FIFRA, an applicant may seek what is known as a \"me-too\" registration for pesticides where \"the pest icide and prop osed use are identical or substantially sim ilar or differ only in ways that would not signifi cantly increase the risk ofID1reasonable adverse effects on the environment.\" FIFRA \u00a7 3(c)(7)(A). This standard is different from the standard for registration of an original pesticide in that it only requires EPA to compare an applicant's product to existing pesticides\" and determine that the product is, in fact, a \"me-t oo\" version of an existing product and will not increa se the risk of unreasonable adverse effects to human health and the environment. The Agency determines that the pesticide meets this standard by verifying that the composition of the pesticide product is identical or substantially similar to the original product or differs only in ways that would not significantly increase the risk of unreasonable adverse effects to human health and the environment. Since the label is the means by which the Agency regulates the use of the pesticide, 487a the Agency determines that the proposed use of the pesticide meets the 3(c)(7)(A) standard by evaluating the me-too's proposed label to ensure that it is identical or substantially similar to the original product label or differs only in ways that would not significantly increase the risk of unreasonable adverse effects to human health and the environment. Congress passed this provision in 1978 to permit follow-on registrants to share e market with existing registrants under the same conditions that are imposed on existing registrants, based primarily on the similarity in composition and use of these pesticides and the assumpti on that such products generally would not increase the risk of unreasonable adverse effects on the environment 9. In addition, under section 3(c)(3) of FIFRA, the Agency is required to act expeditiously (i.e., within 90 days) on an application for a me-too pesticide that, as proposed , would be identical or substantially similar in composition and labeling to a currently registered pesticide identified in the application, or that would di ffer only in ways that would not significantly increase the risk of unreasonable adverse effects on the environment. 10. EPA has read sections 3(c)(7)(A) and 3(c)(3) as a congressional endorsement of the use and approval of labeling that is identical or substantially similar to labeling found on currently registered pesticides, and EPA has generally encouraged me-too applicants to use labeling that is either identical or substantially similar to the already-EPA-reviewed and approved use instructions and label warnings found on currently register ed products. Indeed, given the statutory language in both of these sections. EPA 488a has generally considered that the FIFRA \"me-too\" provisions envision that \"me-too\" labels will generally be identical or substantially similar labels and therefore not require consid erable agency resources to review. If however, me-too applicants are forced to find alternative means to express the EPA-approved conditions of use, it would require extensive EPA resources and time to discern whether the new language is in fact conveying the same necessary information to allow for the protection of human health and the environment. If the label does not convey the same necessary information. the product cannot be approved as-a me-too because FIFRA prohibits the Agency from approving products under section 3(c)(7)(A) that do not meet the \"me-too\" standard found in that section. 11. Most of the many thousands of me-too product labels on the market are in large respect either identical or substantially similar to the labels used by the original regist rants of the pesticide. Thus, if this court rules that Ma khteshim Agan's label is a violation of copyright, virtually any me-too label could be considered a copyright violation. To the extent me- too registrants are prohibit ed from using language that is substantially similar to labeling for the original pesticide, the practical result may be that the Agency will not be in a position to approve many products as me-toos becaus e they will not meet the section 3(c)(7)(A) standard. 12. I am familiar with the federal court decision issued last year, entitled FMC Corp. v. Control Solutions, Inc., and I believe that it ignores serious. potential impacts on EPA's pesticide program. For example, if that decision were followed 489a by this Court and others, EPA's pesticide program likely would be inundated wi th applications to amend several hundreds of me-too labe ls as their registrants endeavor to avoid potential copyright infringement claims. In fact, since the FMC decision was issued last year, my staff has informed me that it has received several dozen requests to amend labels to avoid potential copyright infringement actions. These applications have required . and will continue to require, the Agency to devote significant resources to activities that are essentially administrative and do not enhance environmental protection. EPA is in essence simply determining whe ther products that it has already approved as me-toos can continue to be registered as me-toos with altered labeling use instructions. The result is, and will continue to be, a major diversion of resources away from other important activities that would protect human health and the environment. 13. Moreover, it is difficult to imagine how many different ways companie s might devise to convey the same information without violating copyright. When EPA establishes a particular condition of use for a pesticide to prevent unreasonable adverse effects to human health and the environment, there are a very limited number of ways - if there is more than one - to express this condition on the label. It is hard to imagine that any of those alternatives ways would not be at least \"substantially similar\" to the original label and thus still potentially subject to copyright infringement actions. For example, there are over 650 2,4-D products, the majority of which are me-toos. It is simply not reasonable to expect that each label would be significantly different from all others to 490a avoid copyright infringement and yet ensure that users will not be confused. 14. There is a real concern that these copyright infringement actions complicate the Agency's ability to ensure protection of human health and the environment. It is important for pesticides that are similar and are inte nded to be used similarly to have clear and consistent labeling. The label is essential in ensuring that me- too products are used in the same manner as the original product. Conveying application instructions and safety messages for similar produc ts in different ways increases the likelihood th at the product will be misused. For example, my staff has informed me that some companies who have sought amendments of their labels to avoid copyright infringement claims have submitted labels in which language that was mandatory on the original label is paraphrased as discretionary. While the Agency would not be able to approve such a change in language under section 3(c)(7)(A), this example highlights the difficulty and confusion of registrants in trying to meet the FIFRA me-too standard and avoid potential copyright infringement actions. Differences in labeling similar products also diminish the Agency's ability to enforce pesticide labeling in a co nsistent manner and thus defeats one of the primary purposes of labeling. I hereby declare and affirm, subject to the penalties of perjury, that the foregoing statement is true and correct. /s/ Lois Rossi 491a IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF ARIZONA GOWAN CO., LLC and CANYON GROUP, LLC Plaintiffs, v.

This standard is different from the standard for registration of an original pesticide in that it only requires EPA to compare an applicant's product to existing pesticides\" and determine that the product is, in fact, a \"me-t oo\" version of an existing product and will not increa se the risk of unreasonable adverse effects to human health and the environment. The Agency determines that the pesticide meets this standard by verifying that the composition of the pesticide product is identical or substantially similar to the original product or differs only in ways that would not significantly increase the risk of unreasonable adverse effects to human health and the environment. Since the label is the means by which the Agency regulates the use of the pesticide, 497a the Agency determines that the proposed use of the pesticide meets the 3(c)(7)(A) standard by evaluating the me-too's proposed label to ensure that it is identical or substantially similar to the original product label or differs only in ways that would not significantly increase the risk of unreasonable adverse effects to human health and the environment. Congress passed this provision in 1978 to permit follow-on registrants to share e market with existing registrants under the same conditions that are imposed on existing registrants, based primarily on the similarity in compo sition and use of these pesticides and the assumpti on that such products generally would not increase the risk of unreasonable adverse effects on the environment 9. In addition, under section 3(c)(3) of FIFRA, the Agency is required to act expeditiously (i.e., within 90 days) on an application for a me-too pesticide that, as proposed , would be identical or substantially similar in composition and labeling to a currently registered pesticide identified in the application, or that would di ffer only in ways that would not significantly increase the risk of unreasonable adverse effects on the environment. 10. EPA has read sections 3(c)(7)(A) and 3(c)(3) as a congressional endorsement of the use and approval of labeling that is identical or substantially similar to labeling found on currently registered pesticides, and EPA has generally encouraged me-too applicants to use labeling that is either identical or substantially similar to the already-EPA-reviewed and approved use instructions and label warnings found on currently register ed products. Indeed, given the statutory language in both of these sections. EPA 498a has generally considered that the FIFRA \"me-too\" provisions envision that \"me-too\" labels will generally be identical or substantially similar labels and therefore not require consid erable agency resources to review. If however, me-too applicants are forced to find alternative means to express the EPA-approved conditions of use, it would require extensive EPA resources and time to discern whether the new language is in fact conveying the same necessary information to allow for the protection of human health and the environment. If the label does not convey the same necessary information. the product cannot be approved as-a me-too because FIFRA prohibits the Agency from approving products under section 3(c)(7)(A) that do not meet the \"me-too\" standard found in that section. 11. Most of the many thousands of me-too product labels on the market are in large respect either identical or substantially similar to the labels used by the original regist rants of the pesticide. Thus, if this court rules that Ma khteshim Agan's label is a violation of copyright, virtually any me-too label could be considered a copyright violation. To the extent me- too registrants are prohibit ed from using language that is substantially similar to labeling for the original pesticide, the practical result may be that the Agency will not be in a position to approve many products as me-toos becaus e they will not meet the section 3(c)(7)(A) standard. 12. I am familiar with the federal court decision issued last year, entitled FMC Corp. v. Control Solutions, Inc., and I believe that it ignores serious. potential impacts on EPA's pesticide program. For example, if that decision were followed 499a by this Court and others, EPA's pesticide program likely would be inundated wi th applications to amend several hundreds of me-too labe ls as their registrants endeavor to avoid potential copyright infringement claims. In fact, since the FMC decision was issued last year, my staff has informed me that it has received several dozen requests to amend labels to avoid potential copyright infringement actions. These applications have required . and will continue to require, the Agency to devote significant resources to activities that are essentially administrative and do not enhance environmental protection. EPA is in essence simply determining whe ther products that it has already approved as me-toos can continue to be registered as me-toos with altered labeling use instructions. The result is, and will continue to be, a major diversion of resources away from other important activities that would protect human health and the environment. 13. Moreover, it is difficult to imagine how many different ways companie s might devise to convey the same information without violating copyright. When EPA establishes a particular condition of use for a pesticide to prevent unreasonable adverse effects to human health and the environment, there are a very limited number of ways - if there is more than one - to express this condition on the label. It is hard to imagine that any of those alternatives ways would not be at least \"substantially similar\" to the original label and thus still potentially subject to copyright infringement actions. For example, there are over 650 2,4-D products, the majority of which are me-toos. It is simply not reasonable to expect that each label would be significantly different from all others to 500a avoid copyright infringement and yet ensure that users will not be confused. 14. There is a real concern that these copyright infringement actions complicate the Agency's ability to ensure protection of human health and the environment. It is important for pesticides that are similar and are intended to be used similarly to have clear and consistent labeling. The label is essential in ensuring that me- too products are used in the same manner as the original product. Conveying application instructions and safety messages for similar produc ts in different ways increases the likelihood th at the product will be misused. For example, my staff has informed me that some companies who have sought amendments of their labels to avoid copyright infringement claims have submitted labels in which language that was mandatory on the original label is paraphrased as discretionary. While the Agency would not be able to approve such a change in language under section 3(c)(7)(A), this example highlights the difficulty and confusion of registrants in trying to meet the FIFRA me-too standard and avoi d potential copyright infringement actions. Differences in labeling similar products also diminish the Agency's ability to enforce pesticide labeling in a co nsistent manner and thus defeats one of the primary purposes of labeling. I hereby declare and affirm, subject to the penalties of perjury, that the foregoing statement is true and correct. /s/ Lois Rossi 501a GROUP 11 FUNGICIDE Willowood Azoxystrobin 2.08SC Broad spectrum fungicide for control of plant diseases and for control of listed post-harvest diseases in banana and citrus and control of listed diseases on labeled turf sites.

PRODUCT INFORMATION Willowood Azoxystrobin 2.08SC is a broad spectrum, preventative fungicide with systemic and curative properties recommended for the control of many important plant diseases. Willowood Azoxystrobin 2.08SC may be applied as a foliar spray in alternating spray programs or in tank mixes with other registered crop protection products. All applications must be made according to the us e directions that follow. RESTRICTIONS Do not graze or feed clipping s from treated turf areas to animals. Do not use for disease control in food crops grown in greenhouses. Use for disease control in greenhouses for non-agricultural uses on grass, turf or ornamental plants (listed on this label) are permitted. 508a DO NOT spray Willowood Azoxystrobin 2.08SC where spray drift may reach apple trees. DO NOT spray when conditions favor drift beyond area intended for application. Conditions which may contribute to drift include thermal inversion, wind speed and direction, sprayer nozzle/pressure combinations, spray droplet size, etc. Contact your State extension agent for spray drift prevention guidelines in your area. DO NOT use spray equipment which has been previously used to apply Willowood Azoxystrobin 2.08SC to spray apple trees. Even trace amounts can cause unacceptable phytotoxic ity to certain apple and crabapple varieties. PRECAUTIONS Willowood Azoxystrobin 2.08SC is extremely phytotoxic to certai n apple varieties. AVOID SPRAY DRIFT. Extreme care must be used to prevent injury to apple trees (and apple fruit). AVOIDING SPRAY DRIFT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE APPLICATOR. Willowood Azoxystrobin 2.08SC may demonstrate some phytotoxic effects when mixed with products that are formulated as EC's. These effects are enhanced if applic ations are made under cool, cloudy conditions and these conditions remain for several days following applicatio n. In addition, adjuvants that contain some form of silicone have also contributed to phytotoxicity. 509a USE INSTRUCTIONS Application: Thorough coverage is necessary to provide good disease control. Make no more spray solution than is needed for application. Avoid spray overlap, as crop injury may occur. Adjuvants: When an adjuvant is to be used with this product, the use of an adjuvant that meets the standards of the Chemical Producers and Distributors Association (CPDA) adjuvant certification is recommended. Efficacy: Under certain conditions conducive to extended infection periods, use another registered fungicide for additional applications if maximum amount of Willowood Azoxystrobin 2.08SC has been used. If resistant isolates to Group 11 fungicides are present, efficacy can be re duced for certain diseases. The higher rates in the rate range and/or shorter spray intervals may be required under certain conditions of heavy infection pressure, with highly susceptible varieties, or when environmental conditions are cond ucive to disease. INTEGRATED PEST (DISEASE) MANAGEMENT Willowood Azoxystrobin 2.08 SC should be integrated into an overall disease and pest management strategy whenever the use of a fungicid e is required. Cultural practices known to reduce disease development should be followed. This should include selection of varieties with disease to lerance, removal of plant debris in which inoculums overwinters, and proper timing and placement of i rrigation. Consult your local agricultural authorities for additional IPM strategies established for your area. Willowood 510a Azoxystrobin 2.08SC may be used in State Agricultural Extension advisory (disease forecasting) programs which recommend application timing based on environmental factors favorable for disease development. Crop Tolerance: Plant tolerance has been found to be acceptable for all crops on the label, however, not all possible tank-mix combinations have been tested under all conditions. When possible, it is recommended to test the combinations on a small portion of the crop to ensure that a phytotoxic response will not occur as a result of application. See the PRECAUTIONS section for apple phytotoxicity information. RESISTANCE MANAGEMENT GROUP 11 FUNGICIDE Willowood Azoxystrobin 2.08SC (azoxystrobin) is a Group of action for Willowood Azoxystrobin 2.08SC is the inhibition of the Qol (quinone within the electron transport system [Group 11]. Fungal pathogens can develop resistance to products with the same mode of action when used repeatedly. Because resistance develop cannot be predicted, use of this product should conform to resistance management strategies established for the crop an d use area. Consult your local or State agricultural authorities for resistance management strategies th at are complementary to those in this label. Resistance management strategies may include alternating and/or tank-mixing with products having different modes of action or limiting the total number of applicatio ns per season. Syngenta encourages responsible resistance management to 511a ensure effective long-term control of the fungal diseases on this label. Follow the crop specific resistance management recommendations in the directions for use. If no resistance recommendation on number of applications is specified in the directions for use, follow the recommendations in the table below. If planned total number of fungicide applications per crop is: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 Recommended Solo Qol fungicide sprays 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 4 Recommended Qol fungicide sprays in mixture (tank-mix formulation) 1 2 2 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 5 6 In situations requiring multiple sprays, develop season long spray programs for Group 11 (Qol) fungicides. In crops where two sequential Group 11 fungicide applications ar e made, they should be alternated with two or more applications of a fungicide that is not \u00b7in Group 11. If more than 12 applications are made, observe the following guidelines: When using Qol fungicide as a solo product, the number of applications must be no more than 1/3 (33%) of the total number of fungicide applications per season. For Qol mixes in programs in which tank mixes or pre mixes of Qol with mixing partners of a 512a different mode of action are utilized, the number of Qol containing applications must be no more than Y. (50%) of the total number of fungicide applications per season. In programs in which applications of Qol are made with both solo products and mixtures, the number of Qol containing applications must be no more than Y. (50%) of the total number of fungicide applications per season. If Group 11 fungicide is app lied to the seed or soil, do not make another application with a Group 11 fungicide for at least 3 weeks. Rotational Crop Restrictions The following crops may be planted at the specified interval following application of this product. Crop Rotational Interval Buckwheat, millet Plant Back Interval 12 months All other crops with Azoxystrobin registered uses 0 days SOILBORNE/SEEDLING DISEASE CONTROL For those crops that have sp ecific use directions for soilborne disease control: Willowood Azoxystrobin 2.08SC can provide control of many soilborne diseases if applied early in the growing season. Specific applications for soilborne diseases include in-furrow applications and banded applications applied over the row, either shortly after plant emergence or during herbicide applications or cultivation. These applications will prov ide control of pre- or 513a postemergence damping off and diseases that infect plants at the soil-plant interface. The use of either type of application depends on the cultural practices in the region. In some locations, one type of application may prov ide better disease control that the other, depending on the timing of the disease epidemic. Seedling diseases are generally controlled by in-furrow applications while banded applications are more effective against soilborne diseases that develop later in the season. Consult your local expert to get some guidance re garding application type. Under cool, wet conditions, crop injury from soil directed applications can occur. BANDED Apply Willowood Azoxystrobin 2.08SC prior to infection as a directed spray to the soil, using single or multiple nozzle s, adjusted to provide thorough coverage of the lower stems and the soil surface surrounding the plants. Band width should be limited to 7 inches or less. Apply Willowood Azoxystrobin 2.08SC at a rate of 0.40-0.80 fl. oz. product (0.10-0.20 oz. a.i.)/1000 row feet. For banded applications on 22-inch rows, the maximum application rate is 0. 70 fl. oz./1000 row feet. These applications come into contact with the foliage and are counted as foliar applications when considering resistance management. They may be applied during cultivation or hilling operations to pr ovide soil incorporation. 514a IN-FURROW Apply Azoxystrobin 2.08SC as an in- furrow spray in 3-15 gallons of water at planting. Mount the spray nozzle so the spray is directed into the furrow just before the seeds are covered. Use the higher rate when the weather conditions are expected to be conducive for disease development, if the field has a history of Pythium problems, or if minimum/low till programs are in place.

The interaction of many equipment and weather related factors determine the potential for spray drift. AVOIDING SPRAY DRIFT AT THE APPLICATION SITE IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE APPLICATOR AND THE GROWER. ATTENTION Willowood Azoxystrobin 2.08SC is extremely phytotoxic to certai n apple varieties. AVOID SPRAY DRIFT. Extreme care must be used to prevent injury to apple trees (and apple fruit). DO NOT spray Willowood Azoxystrobin 2.08SC where spray drift may reach apple trees. DO NOT spray when conditions favor drift beyond area intended for application. Conditions which may contribute to drift include thermal inversion, wind speed and direction, sprayer nozzle/pressure combinations, spray droplet size, etc. Contact your State extension agent for spray drift prevention guidelines in your area. DO NOT use spray equipment which has been previously used to appl y Willowood Azoxystrobin 2.08SC to spray apple trees. Even trace amounts can cause unacceptable phytotoxic ity to certain apple and crabapple varieties. AVOIDING SPRAY DRIFT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE APPICATOR. Do not apply when weather conditions favor drift from treated areas to non-target aquatic habitat. 516a MIXING AND APPLICATION METHODS Spray Equipment Willowood Azoxystrobin 2.08SC may be applied with all types of spray equipment commonly used for making ground and aerial applications. Proper adjustments and calibration of spraying equipment to give good canopy penetration and coverage is essential for good disease control. Nozzles Equip sprayers with nozzles that provide accurate and uniform application. Nozzles should be the same size and uniformly spaced across the boom. Calibrate sprayer before use. It is suggested that s creens be used to protect the pump and to prevent nozzles from clogging. Screens placed on the suction side of the pump should be 16-mesh or coarser. Do not place a screen in the recirculation line. Use 50-mesh or coarser screens between the pump and boom, and where required, at the nozzles. Check nozzle manufacturer's recommendations. Pump Use a pump with capacity to: (1) Maintain 35-40 psi at nozzles 517a (2) Provide suffic ient agitation in tank to keep mixture in suspension - this requires recirculation of 10% of tank volume per minute. Use a jet agitator or liquid sparge tube for agitation. Do not air sparge. For more information on spray equipment and calibration, consult sprayer manufacturers and state recommendations. For specific local directions and spray schedules, consult the current state agricultural recommendations. Mixing Instructions Willowood Azoxystrobin 2.08SC is a suspension concentrate (SC) formulation. Prepare no more sp ray mixture than is required for the immediate operation. Thoroughly clean spray equipment before using this product. Agitate the spray solution before and during application. Rinse spray tank thoroughly with clean water after each day's use and dispose of pesticide rinsate by application to an already treated area. Willowood Azoxystrobin 2.08SC Alone (No Tank Mix) Add 1/2-2/3 of the required amount of water to the spray or mixing tank. With the agitator running, add Willowood Azoxystrobin 2.08SC to the tank. 518a Continue agitation while adding the remainder of the water. Begin application of the spray solution after Willowood Azoxystrobin 2.08SC has completely dispersed into the mix water. Maintain agitation until all of the mixture has been sprayed. Willowood Azoxystrobin 2.08SC + Tank usually compatible with all tank-mix partners listed on this label. To determine the physical compatibility of Willowood Azoxystrobin 2.08SC with other products, use a jar test. Using a quart jar, add the proportionate amounts of the products to 1 qt. of water. Add wettable powders and water dispersible granular products first, then liquid flowables, and emulsifiable concentrates last. After thoroughly mixing, let stand for at least 5 minutes. If the combination remains mixed or can be remixed readily, it is physically compatible. Once compatibil ity has been proven, use the same procedure for adding required ingredients to the spray tank. Willowood Azoxystrobin 2.08SC has demonstrated some phytotoxic effects when mixed with products that are formulated as emulsifiable concentrates (EC). These effects are enha nced if applications are made under cool, cloudy conditions and these conditions remain for several days following application. In addition, ad juvants that contain some form of silicone have also contributed to phytotoxicity. Mixing in the Spray Tank Add 1/2- 2/3 of the required amount of water to the spray or mixing tank. 519a With the agitator running, add the tank-mix partner(s) into the tank in the same order as described above. Allow the material to completely dissolve and disperse into the mix water. Continue agitation while adding the remainder of the water and Willowood Azoxystrobin 2.08SC to the spray tank. Allow Willowood Azoxystrobin 2.08SC to completely disperse. Spray the mixture with the agitator running. APPLICATION INSTRUCTIONS THROUGH IRRIGATION SYSTEMS (CHEMIGATION) Application Through Irrigation Systems (Chemigation) Use only on crops for which chemigation is specified on this label. Apply this product only through center pivot, solid set, hand move, or moving wheel irrigation systems. Do not apply this product through any other type of irrigation system. Crop injury, lack of effectiveness, or illegal pesticide residues in the crop can result from nonuniform distribution of treated water. Apply in 0.1-0.25 inches/acre. Excessive water may reduce efficacy. If you have questions about calibration, you should contact State Extension Service specialists, equipment ma nufacturers, or other experts. 520a Do not connect an irrigation system (including greenhouse systems) used for pesticide application to a public water system, unless the pesticide label-prescribed safety devices for public water systems are in place. A person knowledgeable of the chemigation system and responsible for its operation, or under the supervision of the responsible person, shall shut the system down and make necessary adjustments sh ould the need arise. Spray Preparation: Chemical tank and injector system should be thoroughly cleaned. Flush system with clean water. Drip Irrigation: Willowood Azoxystrobin 2.08SC may be applied through drip irrigation systems for soilborne disease control. The soil should have adequate moisture capacity prior to drip application. Terminate drip irrigation at fungicide depletion from the main feed supply tank or after 6 hours from start, whichever is shorter. For maximum efficacy, subsequent irrigation (water only) should be delayed for at least 24 hours following drip application. Sprinkler Irrigation Apply this product thro ugh sprinkler irrigation systems including center pivot, lateral move, end tow, side [wheel] roll, traveler, big gun, solid set, or hand move irrigation systems. Do not apply this product through any other type of irrigation system except as specified on this label. 521a Apply with center pivot or continuous-move equipment distributing Y, acre-inch or less during treatment. In general, use the least amount of water required for proper distribution and coverage. If stationary systems (solid set, handlines or wheel lines other than continuous-move) are used, this produc t should be injected into no more than the last 20-30 minutes of the set. Do not apply when winds are greater than 10- 15 mph to avoid drift or wind skips. Do not apply when wind speed favors drift beyond the area intended for treatment. Plant injury, lack of effectiveness, or illegal pesticide residues in the crop can result from nonuniform treated water. Thorough coverage of foliage is required for good control. Good agitation should be maintained during the entire application period. If you have questions about calibration you should contact State Extension Service specialist, equipment manufacturers or other experts. Operating Instructions 1) Do not apply when wind speed favors drift beyond the area intended for treatment. 2) The system must contain a functional check valve, vacuum relief valve, and low pressure drain appropriately loca ted on the irrigation 522a pipeline to prevent water-source contamination from backflow. 3) The pesticide injection pipeline must contain a functional, automatic, quick-closing check valve to prevent the flow of fluid back toward the injection pump. 4) The pesticide injection pipeline must also contain a functional, normally closed solenoid-operated valve located on the intake side of the injection pump and connected to the system interlock to prevent fluid from being withdrawn from the supply tank when the irrigation system is either automatically or manually shut down. 5) The system must contain functional interlocking controls to automatically shut off the pesticide injection pump when the water pump motor stops. 6) The irrigation line or water pump must include a functional pressure switch which will stop the water pump motor when the water pressure decreases to the point where pesticide distribution is adversely affected. 7) Systems must use a metering pump, such as a positive displacement injection pump (e.g., diaphragm pump) effectively designed and constructed of materials that are compatible with pesticides and capable of being fitted with a system interlock. 8) Allow sufficient time for pesticide to be flushed through all lines and all nozzles before turning off irrigation water. A person knowledgeable of the chemigation system and responsible for its 523a operation, or under the supervision of the responsible person, shall shut the system down and make necessary adjustments should the need arise. 9) Do not connect an irrigation system (including greenhouse systems) used for pesticide application to a public water system unless the pesticide label-prescribed safety devices for public water systems are in place. Center Pivot Irrigation Equipment Notes: (1) Use only with drive systems which provide uniform water distribution. (2) Do not use end guns when chemigating Willowood Azoxystrobin 2.08SC through center pivot systems because of nonuniform application. Determine the size of the area to be treated. Determine the time required to apply 1/8-1/2 inch of water over the area to be treated when the system and injection equipment are operated at normal pres sures as specified by the equipment manufactu rer. When applying Willowood Azoxystrobin 2.08SC through irrigation equipment, use the lowest obtainable water volume while maintaining uniform distribution. Run the system at 80-95% of the manufacturer's rated capacity. Using water, determine the injection pump output when operated at normal line pressure. Determine the amount of Willowood Azoxystrobin 2.08SC required to treat the area covered by the irrigation system. 524a Add the required amount of Willowood Azoxystrobin 2.08SC and sufficient water to meet the injection time requirements to the solution tank. Make sure the system is fully charged with water before starting injection of the Willowood Azoxystrobin 2.08SC solution. Time the injection to last at least as long as it takes to bring the system to full pressure. Maintain constant solution tank agitation during the injection period. Continue to operate the system until the Willowood Azoxystrobin 2.08SC solution has cleared the sprinkler head. Solid Set, Hand Move, and Moving Wheel Irrigation Equipment Determine the acreage covered by the sprinklers.

Specific Instructions fo r Public Water Systems 1. Public water system means a system for the provision to the pub lic of piped water for human consumption if such system has at least 15 service connections or regularly serves an average of at least 25 individuals daily at least 60 days out of the year. 2. Chemigation systems connected to public water systems must contain a functional reduced-pressure zone, back-flow preventer (RPZ) or the functional equivalent in the water supply line upstream from the point of pesticide introduction. As an option to the RPZ, the water from the public water system should be discharged into a reservoir tank prior to pesticide introduction . There shall be a complete physical break (air gap) between the outlet end of the fill pipe and the top or overflow rim of the rese rvoir tank of at least twice the inside diameter of the fill pipe. 3. The pesticide injection pipeline must contain a functional, automatic, quick-closing check valve to prevent the flow of fluid back toward the injection pump. 526a 4. The pesticide injection pipeline must contain a functional, normally closed, solenoid-operated valve located on the intake side of the injection pump and connected to the system interlock to prevent fluid from being withdrawn from the supply tank when the irrigation system is either automatically or manually shut down. 5. The system must contain functional interlocking controls to automatically shut off the pesticide injection pump when the water pump motor stops, or in cases where there is no water pump, when the water pressure decreases to the point where pesticide distribution is adversely affected. 6. Systems must use a metering pump, such as a positive displacement injection pump (e.g., diaphragm pump) effectively designed and constructed of materials that are compatible with pesticides and capable of being fitted with a system interlock. 7. Do not apply when wind speed favors drift beyond the area intended for treatment.

Integrated Pest (D isease) Management: Sound turf management resulting in healthy, vigorous turf is the foundation of a good IPM program. Cultural practices such as proper choice of turf variety, nutrient management, proper cutting height, thatch management, and proper watering, drainage, and moisture stress management should be integrated with the use of fungicides to increase turf vigor and reduce the susceptibility to disease. Immunoassay 652a detection kits and extension service diagnostic services can assist in the early and accurate identification of causal or ganisms and corresponding selection of the proper f ungicide when required. Resistance Management: Some turf disease pathogens are known to have developed resistance to products used repeatedly for their control. Willowood Azoxystrobin 2.08SC should be applied in a tank mix or alternation program with other registered fungicides that have a different mode of action and to which pathogen resistance has not developed. Do not apply more than two sequential Willowood Azoxystrobin 2.08SC applications for Pythium spp. control. For all other diseases when Pythium spp. Is not present, do not apply more than three sequential applications of Willowood Azoxystrobin 2.08SC.
