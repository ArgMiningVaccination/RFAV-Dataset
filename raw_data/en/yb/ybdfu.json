Materials and Methods: Obtaining potential therapeutic targets for diseases by bioinformatics methods based on GEO datasets. Network pharmacology methods were applied to search the TCMSP and HERB databases to obtain compounds and herbs acting on the targets and construct the network. Subsequently, the validation was conducted by molecular docking. Results: We constructed a target-compound-herb network containing 313 nodes and 1244 edges, which contains 5 core targets (ESR1, CDK2, TP53, odorifera T. Chen)). Molecular docking results showed good binding of the core compound to the target. Conclusions: TCM against IBC has great potential. This study provides a new approach for the combined treatment of IBC with Western and Chinese medicine. The core targets, compounds, and herbs can provide ideas for future experimental and clinical research on IBC.
