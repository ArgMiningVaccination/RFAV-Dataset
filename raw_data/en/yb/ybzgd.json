IL 139 iiirJOHN I. SFEKINS, JR.Superintendent of Schools ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The implementation of Career Education could only be pOSsible with the full support and encouragement of the South Portland Board of Education and John I. Seekins, Jr., Superintendent of Schools.Special thanks are extended to the members of the Career Education Ad- visory Committee for giving freely of their time in order to provide valuable assistance and practical recommendations for the three year project.A great deal of effort and interest has been given by the Elementary Curriculum Directors. Their contribution to the overall organization and structure will ensure the implementation and infusion of Career Education into the elementary school program.Much credit for the success of this guide belongs to the elementaryprincipals, teachers, and librarians.in South Portland whoAave demonstrated their enthusiasm, creativity, and adaptability in integrating career education into the elementary curriculum.'Special recognition is due those teachers who participated in the curriculum workshops and gave generously of their time and talents in the preparation of the guides, Career Education Awareness Program K - 6 and Car)ter.Eeucation Awareness Program K - 6 Revised 1976.. These people wereactively,involved in the preparation IMO it Of erniSfill II !IV$ 11111South Portland made a commitment in 1973 to,develop the concept of Career Education through-'out the school system.It soon became evident, tat if this conceptwere to be an integral part of, the.total elemen-,tary curriculum, some tool had to be prOvided asa guide for the classroom teacher. 1An informal needs assessment indicated that ,teachers and curriculum directors felt a need fora brief statement of philosophy, some means ofincorporating this concept into the existing cur-riculum and practical suggestions for the imple-mentation of these findings.The Elementary Career Education Coordinator,as the resource person, initiator, and coordinatorfor this project, reviewed and evaluated materialssubmitted from various so es; contacted resourcepersonsf and encouraged teachers to try some of the ac ivities and procedureswhich hb&proven successful in other situations.During the school year 1973-74 a workshop was conducted with 15 teachersrepresenting the various grade levels,:the elementary 'Curriculum directors,and the career education coordinator. 'They participate4 in qua developmentof a philosoOly, completed a review of,purriculum areas where the concept ofcareer education could be infused, and compiled activ ties which could providea means of implementation. The final editing was don by the administrationand curriculum directors.The guide was distributed to all teachers to stdy, to use, and to evaluate.It then became apparent that if continued growth and Jdevelopment of career edu-cation as a concept were to be assured, revisions ha4 to be made.During the school year of 1974-75, the Career E4ucationStaff expanded thethree original goals to eight. A career development,design for K - 12 which,hopefully, would help to ensure the realization of lese suggested goals wasrecommended to the supervisory staff.A second assessment.was made during this pariodi of time. A workshop con-ducted by the Career Education Coordinator was held in the spring,. The eleven 'teachers participating in this workshop were charged with the responsibility ofmaking revisions in Parts II, III, and IV of the guide.Aa result of the workshop three major changes in the guide evolved:-(1) all activities were designed to relate to and nurture a better understandingof the eight goals; (2) a process for collecting, recording, and retrieving vii141 informition regaraing community resoUrces was formulated by the elementarylibrarian, and (3) an index keyed to subject areas was developed.The reVised materials were again edited and the new handOooks were,distributed to classroom teachers for another round of study, use, andevaluation - the process of developing the concept thus becoming theprogram. 142 viii 4 - o PART I - OVERVIEWCareer Education: PhilosophyCareer Education in South Portland CAREER EDUCATION: PHILOSOPHY We believe: 4That the concept, Career Education, because of its concern with self aware- .ness,.the World of work and the value of work, can be'a catalyst for the South 'Portland Schools as they endeavor to develop effective, happy and well-adjusted , ,citizens now and in the future. *Our elementan- students should then have:the oppertunity'to honestly examine and discuss their owncharacteristics as they gradually develop realistic goalsfor dai.- living and.future well-being;the oppr-tunity to observe, discuss and opportunities offered in the irimediate area; -the oppertunity to grow in an understanding and,appreciationof each /erson's contribution as a worker in the school orthe community.ITeteachers should: provide a classroom atmosphere which is comfortable,. stimu..-lating and Conducive to the growth of interpersonal communi-,cation;provide many opportunities for exposure to the varied formeof employment found in the coMmunity;provide opportunities for students to develop a respect forthe basic skills as steppingstones in the'n chosen careers.The shonla: (be supportive and actOoly involvedin helping studentsbecome aware of skills and attitudes which lead to produc-tivity in the' world of work. 4 .,CAREER EDUCATION IN SOUTH PORTLAND 1Elementary The elementary component of career education is awareness. .From kinder-garten through grade six students become involved in aptivities designed tohelp them become aware of themselves as individuals; 4 velop an awareness ofthe world of work,,and\" gain an appreciation for the-value of work.Self awareness is developed through many discussions devoted to helpingstudents oecome aware. of their interests,,skills, feelings, and values. Ac-tivities are designed to help students put their findings into practice. Sdhoolexperiences offer many opportunities to'develoP tolerance, cooperation, and theHmeans for handling such emotions as fear(and,anger. Through practice in theuse of the decision.making process, the students learn the need for commitment;they also learn that sometimes they must live with the unpleasant results of a dedision.The scope of awareness broadens from the sell -o include workers in theJima, school, and community. Participation in field trips, mini-trips, class-room visitations,.arid interviews helps students learn about working conditions, tools needed in various trades, and the economic reafities facing the producer and the consumer.Since school is the child's world of work, it is here that he acOuires attitudes about the value of work and the relevance of education. The innersatisfaction of dompleting a task well and the feeling of'pride in accomplish-:ment are fadtors constantly emphasized by the feacher.The value of work.isalso stressed by many of the workers interviewed. Class discussions help the\"student to identify and aisess the contributions made by workers to society 111%'and the.personal satisfaction gained.4 .. :areer Education palft, a knowledge of theWorld of work and workersfbut of more importance.......= provides for an understanding.-of one s Self :and one's values as a basis for funure career planning. Secondary Nades seven through twelve progress from awareness techniques toprograms and activities which sequentially provlit an orientation to, exploration'of and preparation for the world of work.At the secondary level, the responsibility for implementing the career edu-cation concept lies with the guidance personnel and a nucleus of classroomteachers.Resource rpnters 4-o exr-nience receive.major emphasisat this level.Seniors are offered a semester elective in career preparation. Career testing,counseling, and job placement are services which are also made available to them.A simulated job interview with a business representative is the culminating ac-tivity which helps to bring the total program into focus.All teachers at elementary and secondary levels have an opportunity to par-ticipate in the Career Guidance Institute. This course gives the teacher a chanceto become-more knowledgeable about employees and.their specific responsibilitiesin the world of work. 146-5- Teacher teams have,done a good deal of researdh in the,areas of mathematici, English and social studies: As A result of the research and involvement in the above Mentioned activities, curriculum changes have been implemented in an endeavor to make school more relevant to students in meeting their career needs, Dropouts and graduates are encouraged to use the resource room and the ser- vices of the guidance staff, for career counseli g or as a placement service.' Community The school is actively seeking the cooperation of-the community in the imple- mentation of career education. Information about the concept is disseminated to the community through the media, and at civic and parent-teacher meetings.The Career Guidance Institute, a career education course, is offered annually to 41P school administrators, parents, business personnel, students and teachers.A free exchange of ideas from these groups is encouraged. An advisory board, also cOmposed of a cross section of education and community representatives, makes recommendations whj.ch help to shape educational policiett. Parents and business personS serve frequently as resources to the classroom teacher.Classes visit local industries and interview and shadow workers or have the opportunity to listen to visiting business personnel at their schools. Parents give their services as volunteer aides by teaching mini-courses in crafts, demon- strating skills, or chaperoning and chauffeuring groups on field trips.This .assistance from the parents and the.business community is invaluable to the school system. lk 147. -6- PART II - SEQUENTIAL PLAN K - 6The Career Development DesignObjectives, Activities, and EvaluatiVe TechniquesSelected Lesson Plans 40 148 4PART II. - SEQUENTIAL PLAN K This section presents activities to assist classroom teachers irymeeting 4the career development needs,of.elementary students.The list is not intendedto be an outline of a prescribed course of study.

In'1658, the region now occupied by Portland; SouthPortland, Cape Elizabeth, Westbrook, add -FalmOuth was incorporated into theState of Hassathusetts and named Falmouth.The earliest settlements in South Portland were at Purpoodock Point(SMVTI property)'and Long Creek. These settlers did not enjoy much peaceand quiet because of the.threatening troubles with the Indians during theFrench and Indian Wars. With-the coming of peace, the settlements grew andprospered.Cape Elizabeth, which included South Portland, Was established-as a district separate from Portland in' 1765..It was not until 1895 that South Portland was separated as a town fromCape Elizabeth: Tha partition was due largely to a disputer\u00f3ver the intro-duction of Sebago Lake water-to the city, causing increased taxation. In1898, South Portland received its,official city charter from the state. Economy region Atracted the adventurous men-who first came'for the excellentfishifi and fur trading opportimities in the area. With the coming of thefirst settlers, farming and,fishing were the main modes of employment. As thesettlements grewm. the people became more dependent on one another for neededgoods and services, which resulted in varied employment.The lumber industry formed the wellspring of ptosperity, employing many,men in the )arvesting, processing, and shipping of the forest products.Thetrade in lumber supported the West Indies trade -- resulting in the importationof sugar, molasses, and rum.The maritime trade flourished and during the War of 1812 privateeringbecame profitable. During the 1840's shipbuilding cane to be a very signifi-cant part of,the economy of South Portland, and many shipyards were in fulloperation building and repairing vessels. Many talents were employed in thisindustry as most of the work was done by hand. Lobstering and fishini continuedto be an important means of earning a living, and with the growing sophisticationof the people, various artisans found employment in their fields. An interestingsidelight of silversmithing was theemployment of workers fashioning not onlyarticles of beauty for the tab *- but enjoying a lively business in the crafting'of knee, shoe, and sleeve 1utons,for clothing.

LeisUre.and Re ationS. The people in former times had little time for leisure and in the be-ginning, their recreation was necessarily tied to their way of life and work.The first settlers found amusement and relaxation within thehome. Roads were .nothing but narrow'paths crisscrossing the woods, wolves were abundant; aprize of 40 shillings to anyone who shot a wolf, and homes were scattered andisolate&Church and town meetings provided occasions for meeting friends. Muchmerriment was present in spinning and quilting bees, barn raising and'harvesttimes.As free time increased, clubs and social- parties were formed usuallymeeting at a local tavernosleighing parties' organized in winter, fishing andbathing in the summer and visiting the islands were all popular forms ofrecreation.Theatricil entertiinments were-wholly unknown here before the revolution.It wasn't until late in the 1800's that the theater played an iMportant part.of the recreational scene when Free Street in Portland became known as theGreat White,Way. Until that.time therd was a steady stream of itinerant per -formeri, jugglers, minstrels; and such. Weekly lectures were also wellattenfled:With theadvent of the trolley line, Many people spent their Sundaysoying life at the tr011ey parks where swimming, bowling, and meeting'friends provided diversion. Education Education did not receive much 'attention until the late quarter of the19th century, when the town voted to establish its own public high school.Prior to 1765, students desiring formal education were sent to Portland toattend school, boarding in with friends or relatiVes In Portland. In 1765,the first gramear school was established in South (Portland, and four schoOldistricts dbre apportioned in 1771, but there was lonly/61e teacher appointed,who necessarily had to share his time between the districts and resulted in amoving grammar school; By 1875, there were fourteen school districts withinthe town, but schools were still inadequate.

A RESOURCE VISITORS There are times when taking ;Weldtrip can be like moying the mountain 'to Mohammed.Instead,'why not invite a resource Person into-the-classroom?The school is designed for teaching:and many presentations can be made betterin the convenience of the school rather than on location. Classroom visitsprovide a change and they offer the students opportunities to learn about thereal world through direct contact with members of the community.PreparationBefore inviting a resource person into the classroom, the teacher shouldexamine the curriculum and determine how a classroom visitor can best serve,its objectives.After selecting a guest presenter, the teacher should contact him/her todiscuss the classroom visit. The teacher will need to learn background infor-mation about the speaker and the nature of the presentation. The guest, inturn, should be advised about the :1ass and its understanding oUthe topic,the ob4ectives of -me visit, and the nole of-thespeaker. Questions whichhave been prepared by the students may be given to the visitor at thistime.,Attention should be given to the details of the visit. The date, allotted -time, end directions to.the school bLdlding and classroom should be made clear. 11The speaker's needs for a projector, table, maps, water soUrde, etc. should be310-172- determined.Following the interview', confirmation of all discussedshould be sent, in writing, to:the speaker.Pupil PlanningWhenever possible,the students should be allowed to sharein pladning for a classroom visitor. They may'assigt,in the selection of the epeaker, .helpin the prepAration of questions, welcome and introduce the speaker when she/hearrives, and express thanks after the presentation. Student involvement in the planning of follow-up activities is most beneficial.InterviewingInterest in the people who visit the classroom or are visited in theworld of work provides a meaningful opportunity to learn the tec1jiques ofinterviewing which are a part of the language program.The teacher can help the children to distinguish between,questions aboutthe work and questions about the worker. The first deals with information,and facts; the latter, with attitudes and feelings. Below are some sample questions which may be used in an interview:About the Work 1.What is'the m6e of 'your job? do? What tools do4you need? Whatmight you do in a typical day? Is the work dangerous?Monotonous? 3.What hours do you work? How many hours a week? What doesyour working place look like? 4.What kind of education is necessary for this kind of work?.Is there on-the-job training? Do you get more raises withformal education? 5.About how much money can someone earn at this kind of work?Is salary paid monthly or are there hourly wages? Are thereany commissions or tips? Is there a chance of getting a 10of money all at once, or losing money quick*?Are thereany fringe benefits and vacations? About the Worker 1.As you see itwhat are the acroaritages and disadvantages of-your job? 2., Is there anything abOut your job:that gives yoU a great'dealof satisfaction and priCle? 3.How do you occupy your self dOrirlg your free time? 4.If you had your. Choice of jobs 'What would.you choose to do? 5.How did.you get involved in yOUr present occupation^? 6.Would you recommend this kind of work for your children? 7.What was your opinion of this Xirld'of work before you gotinto it?Follow7Up'The type of activities which follow a claasroom presentation will dependupon the nature of the visit. Some follow-uP dctiviiies might include these: 1.Visit the site. 2.Prepare a bulletin board or diSPlay. 3.Write an experience chart. 4.Research related careers. .5.Dramatize related situations. 6.View films and filmstrips reldted topics. any skills most impoftant follow-up activity is 4n expression of preciation from the teacher and the children. \"?312-174- I., Names, addresses, and telephone numbers of resource persons are cataloguedin the elementar7 school libraries under below.'

Xi339 CURRICULUM REVISIONyROCESS.South Portland English Department The process of curriculum revision Of the South Portland school system 7'Project REVAMP - began in the 1973-74 school year with focus upon the secondarymathematics department. This three-year program of revision includes also theEnglish and social studies departments, one year being spent for special emphasisupon each.Infusion oE career education into the curricula of these major de-partments will expand into other areas as well. The following account describesthe process of curriculUT revision in the secondary English department of SouthPortland.Selection of staff wa.scthe first step. Curriculum coordinators were chosenby the administration from the secondary faculty, one teacher from the juniorhigh and one from the high school. These teachers, released for the year fromclas'sroom teaching, worked under the supervision of a director of career edu-cation (assistant superintendent of schools) and an assistant director of careereducation.The teachers selected as curriculum coordinators are experiencedclassroom teachers with some knowledge of this city's education system, thecharacter of$the community itself, and an avowed interest in meeting the needsof students regarding education and career.The staff's first major task early in September was the setting of objectivesfor the entire year. IA general these included a thorough review of the presutcurriculum, visits to various schools in and out of the South Portland system,the study of curriculum and career education materials, contacting parentt and:students, working with teachers, development of the year's career education 'program (workshops, acquisition of new materials, development of new courses).Each coordinator composed a process chart setting forth.monthly objectives forthe school,year. This calendar served as a guide for the major activities ofthe staff, and was amended continually. Although we experienced some real frus-.tration trying to plan an entire year's program at the very beginning of theyear, before we actually knew where we were going, we found that, once outlined,Our work for each month was more easily determihed and more efficientlycdom-plished.The vocess chart afso provides a step-by-step accotint of our year'swork.During the first weeks, a great many hours were spent in reading, studying,and ordering various materials to increase Our own background of knowledge and \\]understanding'of the concept of career education, its successe and failureselsewhere in the country. We found an overwhelming amount of iterature, somevery helpful and some very confusing. Our pursuit of information continuedthroughout the year.. Resources included curriculum guides from other schoolsand from other states, abstracts, microfiche, and other ERIC materials, profes-sional texts and journals, films and filmstrips, periodicals (Career EducationNews, Career Education Digest, newsletters) and publications of the NationalCouncil of Teachers of English. -Needs assessment was the most time-cOnsuming project of the entire year.We now'realize that this process could have been done lilloreily and finishedearlier had wp spent less time in search of an instrument already devised and ., L10 tested, and created dub own - which e/entually we had to.do. Weestudied theRight tp Read'assessment instrument, visited State LibrarY Augusta andthe University of Maine Portland-Gorhain CurriOuluMlibrary in searCh of _further'aSsessment materials, eXPlored through ERIC, and.spent mUch time trying to dis-cover what others had done before us. Finally we- followed the advice of our'ownelementary, coordinator: never mind what others have done. Write your own.Our needs assessment inVolved four areak.of research:. ,South Portland.teachers,parents, students, rici the cOmMunity. Meetings with at and senior high schools, con-.ducted by the qurriculum'coordinatorsand a fifty-item'questionnaire was preparedand distributed tO every secondary teacher. .-.The purpose of all this survey ofteachers was to ascertain Wbat is'actually being.taught and how, what skills are,needed, what duplication exists, and what-gaps in the curriculumneed to be filled-.Teachers received the quesonnaire October 1 and were asked to compilete it\"byOctober 15.They'were not required to sign their,name6, but department chairmenc,fere asked to collect every form so that the survey would represent the entireEnglish department. 45wers were tabulated and pomments compiled, and to teachers Odtober 31. 44uch helpful.infOr-mation was acquired in ffil5 survey and used in many ways throughout the year. Forexample, teachers expressed opinions regarding the kinds of meetings they preferred,the extent of,their interest in communiCating with teachtrs at levels.above andbelow theirown, and topics to be explored in workshops.,. Evening meetings with Parents were scheduled at the.junior and senior highschools.These meetino were attended.by the'Career EdUcation staff and Englishdepartment chairman, swerintendent, ahd principals. ,A slide presentation showingsome of South Portland'S.gai\"eer education activities was offered,ai.the juniorhigh schools, and at all metings free,discussion of the curriculum and its needswas encouraged. Parent5 had received notices of these meetings, and studentvolunteers helped with telephoning. Attendance was' much.smallerthan we hoped,but those parents who attended participatedwith interest and offered some- help-ful ideas.In additi9h to these specially planned parent meetings, career-edu-cation personnel were'a',/ailable in the Career Resource Center of eabh school atthe annual Open House for parentsStudent Opinion was sought through.questionnaires, classroom discussions,and guidance groups. senior surveys adthinigtered by the guidance department andfive-year surveys of graduates gave us some indication. of student needs andopinions.The 4ue4tionnaires were given to representative classes at each level,tabulated by the teachers, and the results stenciled and representative of the fifteen jobclusters, Were interyielded by the two secondary curriculum coordinators. Wefound the most.effective way to corOuct these interviews was to have one inter-viewer engaged in discussion with the employer while the other took notes, 'Weused a prepared outline Of topics, a copy of which was given to each employer,interviewed:This errIP1 oVer survey form gave direction to the interview andhelped us to obtain the Particular information we wanted. Without exception, .the business people ve interviewed were cooperlive, courteems, even eager totalk about ways in Which education and business can work together for the good 341 of Students and community alike. This same interest and spirit of cooperation., waS evidenced.by our Advisory Board, a.group -representing education, parents,Civic groups, labor, and buSiness.Local publ_shing houses provided useful information both through examinationof t1*.ir catalogs ..=-71 educatIonal materials and through tours showing job and'qrareelr p6ssibilitle,1- for students. Many commercial publications provided in-?. formation and resou=gs. Materials-from exhibits and workshops of state conven:ionl hy,the firms partio0oating in the by the South Portland schools.These weekly visits,= were'madeafter school; over a period of twenty.weeks, by interested teachers,, .studentS, and parents. The curriculur codrdinators also visited a number We.coected curriculumCguides, interviewed books, and made comparisons. Detailed reports of'all v.isits were written by the urriculum coordinators and copies_distributed,,to English teachers,.princ pa)s d interested administrative staff. ,.Another interesting community.contact Was theUniveesity. We found thatorllege instructorS .21rs poorly informed as to secondary curricula, practices,and objeCtives as are Secondary teachers regarding,the college program. Teachers\"at both IevelS expressqd interest in exchange visits to classes and any other .iposainv dommunication.that'.might improve the sequential element of,oeducation.We found a universal criticism -7 from elementary, to junior'high, to senior ir high, to college: there is mutual ignorance regarding:other levels, there isneedless duplication System.Visits-to,rcional yocational schools provided further information. Again,We found that secondary teachers, in the main, knew very little about.the oppor-tunities and programs 'offered by vocational institutions, whose faculties arevery-eager to be Nisited and to improve communication with the'comprehensiveschools who send their pupils for part-tiffie work/study. , We reeommend contacting any other department, organization, or staff thatmight be simultareouslii assessing needs- Often this information can be'shared,. .to the benefit o- both. -For example; bur assessment of curriculuM needs wasadded by surveys administered to various classes arid to,special groups by theguidance departments of our schoolb: Also, South Portland became involved last,year-with the Right to Read program, and the curriculum coordinators attendedmeetings and helped in tailoring the Right to Read needs'assessment instrument,many of whose Concerns were ours also.In December a summary of the most obvious educational needs of the Englishprogram 7of Splith Portland's secondary schools was coMpleted. Other recommenda-tions would be added later. The preliminary recoMmendations were presented tothe School Board on January 6 and approyed at that time. -3--3 4 2o+' ActUal revision of the curriculum was.not delayed until the needs assess-ment was tompleted: Obvioui needs became apparent long before December,/and webegan workingon our.sequential prograM, reviewing and ordering materials'frommany'sources, commercial and professional, field testing,whenever possible theclassroom activities and units that seemed appropriate, viewing films, studying'microfiche and curriculum guides from many states.- .rIndividual all durini the principiis, career education staff, and guidance Cdunselors ..participating.

LANGUAGE ARTS IN THE JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL Our syllabus consists of a program of five components'each havingparticular characteristics:READING AND LITERATURE, whichrecognizes that learning to improve reading skills is a continuousprocess.gives attention to the need for studyadjusts to all levels of ability.affords the opportunity for students to learn tru,Ihs about people.prizes the old but recognizes that much of the contemporary is good.provides for the reading of all types of literature: poetry, drama,biography, fiction and non-fiction.uses audio-visual materials which Brunet' terms \"devices for viclriousexperiences.\"WRITING, whichoffers/frequent practice in \"practical\"-writing but encourages personalwritinp.4 ..,stresses the value of writinp as related to other aspects of the Englishprogram.emphasizes. the process of writing.provides for experiences in descriptive and narrative writin.recognizes that audiences other than the teacher be'offered the student.stresses the mechanics of legible handwriting.

Ne'mustacquire a vivid sense of the beautiful and the morally good. Otherwisehe - with his specialized knowledge - more closely resembles.a welltrained dog than a harmoniously developed person.\" 9 SUGGESTED ACTIVITIES, FOR GROE SEVEN READING A stUdent gets a certain number of miles a map of the United State foreach type of book he reads. An index card is passed in listing the ch ers,'Plot, favorite incident and people for whom the book is recommended. Aestgrade of A is received for each trip across the country.After reading a stKy in class, students write questions to stump a panelof \"experts\" who volunteer to field questions in front of the class.When a student'has-read a short story, he selects an activity froffi a card.file of suggested,topics. This may be -a research topic from the career resource1room or a book from the library based on the material read, VOCABULARY.' -When doing vocabulary in reading, the students submit their own vocabularylists, without definitions. They should learn their individual words and thelist can be handed back as acwocabulary portion of a class test over content.3,WRITING Have the students wri.te.letters to one another and hee them actually putthem in the mail. Evaluations can be made when the,lettfrs are received. Theperson who gets the letter should bring it in for discussion, perhaps by thewriter and the reader in pairs. Of course, if.someone moves, the opportunityfor correspoRding should be seiz,/immediately.Each student has a folded piece of construction paper, kept in class anddecorated as he pleases. Several times a week, a suggested topic is mritten onthe board.Students may write on that topic or one of their own choice.Theteacher spot reads the journals and makes personal comments pertaining to thesubject matter, but not to spelling or grammar. This project helps one to getto know his students.Write autobiographies in a series of weekly installments (describe your firstmemory, your parents, your thoughts toward grammar school years). These areproofread but not graded. Ultimately they are editeeas One piece of writingby the author:Keep track of editorials and cartoons in the newspaper. They,can be.usedboth.for reading and grammar work and are obviously topical enough. Hem studentsfollow one comic strip for a week and write about it.

These can be reprod ced toresemble their appearance in the paper.-16-361 Publishes much as possible what students write. 41ti Take actual paragraphs the studentf have written and type three of them -a good one, a fair one and,a poor ane. Students read them aloud and have theclass rate them as good, fair or poor. Then the class takes a vote and noteshow the majority rated the writing. The teacher then offers opinions about thegrading.Give students the first line of a potential story and have them considerpossibilities in groups. Once enough stories have been told, have them composedon paper,QSAMPLE STORY SHEET 0ConLder these as the firt't.line of a story: 1.Walking carefully across the ice, Bill heard frightening soundsas he reached the middle of the pond.2.All,Alone, I looked for the bus, but it had left.3.As he opened the door, an alarm bell began to clang.Now, a good 'story answers all of a reader's questions. Thus, b4foreyou write, THINK. Ask yourself:.Where could this be happening?Who could be in this story?When'might this be happening?What kind of day is it?What time of day is it?,Are you going to have A surprise ending?If any,of these thoughts leads you to.ideas not liste&here, feelfree to write on them. GROUP ACTIVITIES Students form groups of two or three ana make,lists of spelling words usingnewspapers, magazines, *textbooks.

There is alKays a vocabulary exercisebased on words'in the story or words I have substituted.The stories maybe rewritten to be used for paragraphing, direct quotations, capitals,spelling, synonyms, finding the use of the word in that particular storyand, of course, solving the mystery. Once you get started, there are manyvariations. B.For reluctant maders, I select jokes in which two people are'conversingwith each other and write each person's dialogue on a card.The first tospeak'is numbered 1, the second 2. .When I have enough for a class, all ofthe l's are passed out, then all of the 2's. Someone with a 1 stands'andreads his part of the joke; the one with the corresponding 2 must recognizeit and read his part until the joke has been told. Most kids (any age)love jokes. C.Tricky parts of grammar are more fun if the rules are made into rhymes. \"You can make most nouns plural .'Without a scowl or a frown -The rule is simply th friends,Just add s to the not7.Unless it ends in a buzzing soundFrbm an sh, x, or z -/If it does, make another syllable,Oy adding es, you see.

Sometimes the refund is in the form of a check;,so they learn to handle that correctly.

Itthe greatest of the adVenture stories in the late 1800'and'Kidnapped by Stevenson. Kidnapped has a Jac,bithrilling adventures of David Balfour after he attemptwell is historical waswas stated that perhapsre Treasure Island tO0110bund and retells thecliim his inheritaned.1 ,HoWever, it is more significant than just a tale of adventure. The adventureis the background for the conflict of two distinct characters, David Balfour andAlan Breck.Both are politically as well as morally different, and this conflictcannot be fully realized by students until they know why Alan is as he is and whyDavid is the person he is. And this difference can best be explained by the his-torical events that have made these-characters what they are. Apd so the periodOf:English history from time of James I (late 1600's to mid 1790's) should bediicussed.The following terms, people, or events must be taught, mainly as events,people, or ideas that affected other people's attitudes and beliefs. 1.james I2.Charles I3.- Anne .Jacobite13.Clan14., Campbells15.Scottish dialect16.WhigPerhaps the list could extensive, but if students.can grasp the ideatsuggested bV thit list, they can really begin'to understand that the climax ofKidnapped is not entirely what happens externally to Alan and Davrd; but what happensinternally which is due mainly to their respective backgrounds. An example from the book.to.illustrate the dbed for historical knowledge isvery well brought out in chapter nine.2 It is in this chapter that Alan Breck andDavid Balfour meet and the contrast in age, character, background, and moral atti-tude is keenly observed. Because of lack of sone knowledge of just what the differ-ence, students begin to lose interest in this book at this point. I speak fromexperience.How does one present such historical knowledge tto students in order to makechapter nine:more meaningful? A lecture on the list previously mentioned is possi-ble.It doesn't sound as deadly dull as implied.Here the teacher is the key factor lAllec Ellis, A History of Children's Literature to\"1900.

Another approach isa library assignment (individually) to students whereby they art zesponsible forfipding out such information needed from the list. Reservk books will facilitate:their work.Class reports to share the acquired information would serve to aid,the whole.At 8th grade level this library work must be structured and a auggestedbibliography for Kidnapped is enclosed to enable teachers to do something of thiskind.Audio visual materials are not so readily available for junior'high for the)historical aspects of this book, but those that are relevant and, in some cases,available are listed.-aphy for Kidnapped and New York:J.

This novel is well written and has been noted for its merit. - In 1965 AcAlss Five Aprils receivedthe Follet Award and was runner-up for theNewberry Medal. The story is based on the Creighton family who live in Illinois.The stOry opens just as the Civil War is about to begin. The key figure isJethro Creighton who is too young to go to fight, but who begins to growintomanhood as the events of the time force him to. It is really in Chapter Two thatthe questions of the Civil War, the North vs. the South, the Rroblems and atti-tudes of its characters are made known.6 It is in this chapter that students,4n this particular book, begin to lose intere t as a result.In Chapter Two, a-cousin from Kentucky comes to visit the :re. hton family, and discussion andopinions of the Civil War, the rights of th North and South, and the reasons forcertajm attitudes are brought forth. Here h story must come in, for it helps toshape the earacters of the novel, and its knowledge will help students understandthe characters more fully.,In comparison with Johnny Tremain, perhaps a list of terms, people, events,or places mav be needed in an introductory lecture. Again, the teacher is thekey factor to success of the lecture method. It seems that most students knowmore about the Revolutionary period ir. American History than they do about theCivil War period by the time they reach the eighth grade. This conclusion isonly a result of my experience and observation.

There wassomething at the Fair for every 8th gradA, in South Portland those who plannedto go to a 4 year College,'those. who would4attend a junior college, vocationaltechnicaliiinstitute and riose who plannedifo join the world of work fresh out Of,secondary school. Hobbies and manufacturIng were also thought of and a goodgroup-of hobbyists were also invited to aisplay their works along with a repre-bentative from Junior Achievement.A total commitment by all people within the South Portland system was nec-essary,for the succesS of such a venture. This was displayed in many ways.Guidance counselors oversaw the whole Fair. They encouraged participationand inlolvement by teachers in their classes and pupils in guidance classes. Theyplanned a tho'rough detailed program booklet, name tags, had;pupils make posters,and decorate the building and gym.'

But, of course, themost impressive careers on exhibit were those in which simulation was involved:Dental.Technicians showed the cleaning compound used in'cleaning teeth.Some pupils volunteered to have their teeth cleaned.The hair 4tylist (Mansfield Beauty Academy of Maine) had students volun-teering to have their hair thinned, shaped, cut, trimmed (boys-as well as girls)and sove girls were given instruction on facial makeup, eye shadowing, mascara,'etc.The Culinary Arts Instructor and two of his top seniors showed pupils theart of cake decorating. The 8th graders seemed fascinated with what a tube oficing could create -- rose'petals, buds, leaves, etc.Preparing students for the big day was essential. Guidance counselots,career specialists, South Portland Career Education director and assistants,principals and teachers were all helpful -- giving suggestions and helping inthe planning.Guidance classes were used (2 or 3 periods) prior to the Fair tomotivate the pupils.

Cite words or actions which prove your -contentions.(Most students see Gessler as a man of ideals, and onewho refuses to compromise them. His starvation proves this. He is a.craftsman, a person devoted to doing a job well-. Occasionally somestudents will characterize Gessler as a foolish pereon. They see hisrefusal to advertise nonsense.

What seemed to be themost difficult part of the project was \"Hands-On,\" an experiment involving ninthgraders.The objective of this experiment was to familiarize all ninth grade ,,gtudents with the realities of various career fields.After much thought and many discarded ideas, we devised a very simple planwhich we called Project: Job'Shadowing. Under this plan, each student spentone complete day with a parent, friend, or relative, shadowing himitas he spenta day re ,on the job.If the hours we 4 P.M. io midnight, that was he shift thestudent observed. Because of the age of the students and insurance regulations,we stressed that'they must observe the work and not participate in the work.Our ninth grade English teachers team-taught the six week unit in our CareerResource Center. We also had the services of a full-time guidance secretaryavailable to'us.The PlanWeek 1:We introduced the six week Career Education unit and discussed jobsthe students had already had and were familiar with. A letter to parents and apermission form were distributed and explained. Various shadowing possibilitiesand alternatives were discussed. Week 2:Parents' reactions to the job shadowing idea were disaussed, andany problems regarding,the implementation of the shadowing experiences were re-solved.With the assistance of the English teachers, the fifteen occupationalclusters were reviewed, and attitude and conduct \"on the job\" were discussed.A diary for the job shadowing experience was distributed. The purpose of thisdiary was to introduce work-related concepts such as fringe,benefitS, unionaffiliation, and working conditions, and tds provide for feedback from the jobshadowing experiente.Week 3:Students spent one complete day (or more if the situaiion requiredit) on the job.Week 4:Students shared their experiences with their English classes\\,?usingtheir diary notes, and they completed evaluations of the project.Weeks 5 and 6: Counselors, using the experience of shadowing as a spring-board, encouraged students to relate their day on the job to their own plansfor a high school program of studies and future educational goals. Faculty,parents, and other participants were asked to evaluate the project. ResultsThe job shadowing prpject has been implemented twice with over 80% of theninth grade students partitipating on both occasions. Our students observed allshifts and under all conditions. One,flew to New York City with Air New England.436_91_ Others went all over the states of Maine, New Hamp4shire, and Massachusetts.Many 'firms and individuals offered to have several students shadow. ghree boysotaved right in our own building, shadowing the school painters. The list ofbusinesses and industries represented ranged from a sole proprietor retail storeto large corporations such' as New England Telephone and Fairchild Semiconductor.One student shadowed a crosaing.guard; another followed a union leader, travelingaround the state, holding meetings, and inspecting sites. One of the most popularjob.shadowing experiences was with the South Portland Police.As an additional bonus, 'this project cut across traditional sexist occupa-tional lines.Many girls went to work with their fathel,s and many boys withtheir mothers. One girl spent one day with both of her parents becauSe theyboth wanted \"equal time.\"The excitement and enthusiasm generated in the school was contagious, and 'during the fallow-up class periods, many lively accounts of job shadowing wereshared.This unit also served to introduce the ninth graders to methods of researchingjobs in the Career Apsource Center and to the guidance adSistant. Her responsi-bility was to coordinate and record parental responses, prepare lists orstudentsexcused from school each day4 and send out thank you letters to all teachers,parents, and others who cooperated in the project.EvaluationWe jelt that we had 200 ambassadorS of good Will going into our community.The 80% responses far exceeded our expectations. In addition, this project waseasy to organize and reproduce. In manpower hours, having students make theirown contacts was efficient and imaginative.They.often came up with original .ideas and contacts.Negative evaluations were primarily directed toward the fact that we generallysuggested that students shadow their own parents. Often the students were alreadyfamiliar with their parents' work or were not interested in their parents' jobs. The positive evaluations were many, from the closer bond felt betweeen parentand child to a far stronger understanding of the work world. Most students wantedto repeat the project - shadowing a job-related to their own interests or to com-pare two jobs. Ronaldqgdams\\Rachel PaquetteCynthia SanbornMahoney Junior High School -92- PHILOSOPHY The English Department aT. Scuth Portland High School has two major goals: 1.to equip students with theebasic skills of re ding, writing,and speaking so tnat they will become effective members inour society.A/)2.to heltstudents develop a greater sense of who they are andWhat their potential is.We want our students to be critical thinkerg, sensitive human beings, and-articulate speakers. We want cur students.to develop a respect for and a fa.-cility with the English language, the unifying force in our curriculum.Tosaccomplisb these goals the English partment offers six.skill coursesfor sophomores and a phase elective pro thg juniors and seniors. Intheir sophomore year students culminat a four.-year (grades 7-10) sequence ofskills and activities'in reading, writ ng, language, speaking and listening,and career exploration and values. .Sophomores do not elect their_cdurses.Junior high guidance counselors place sophomores in appropriate skill courses. 1. .Juniors and seniors select their courses based on their future,needs andInterests.Guidance counselors and English teachers counsel students before .4they select co rses. All students must take one of the five American Literature4\\courses, and11 students are strongly advised to take a writing course. .The rationale for our curriculum ii: 1.The English Department believes that students must takeresponsibility for their education. Students should haveproper counseling, but they should also have the oppor-tunity to make choices. Electives require an educationalcommitment from the student. 2.The English Decartment's role.is to offer a balanced program,one which meet5 the needs of all students. We know that allstudents need certain communication skills. ye also knowthat students .1.014Dare interested in their work ten& to per-form better than thgle who are not. We have proVided bothof thege factors, skills and interest, in our program.- 3.Courses are phased, not the students. The inherent flexi-bility of an elective system allows a student to avoid thec=strictions of a tracking system. Where appropriate wehave encouraged heterogeneous grouping.438 -93- All Courses basic English skills.Phase 2a coarse, created far students who need tO improve podrefine 14sie.-Englift skills but at a slower pace-their-in higher phased 'courses.Phase 3 - a course created for students who'have A command of.baaic English skills and who wodld like to advance'beyond these skillSat a moderate pacee:Phasa,4& couree for students who hive _..,. of basic English skills and who ars.160ktMtfor a stimulating academic experience condliCtedeitan advanced pace,,., THESE MEMBERS Op THE HIGH SCHOOL ENGLISH DEPARTMENT WROTE LOWINGCOURSE OUtLINES.

The senior English teachers were most'cooperative and were in-volved in the planning of this actiiity. A detailed plan was worked out betwOenthe Guidance and English Departmentsas Well asdetailed inforMation sheets, whichwere exchanged as the process evolved. _The four guidance counselors and guidance assistant foun4 themselves before :separate,Ehglish classes on the MChday morning following April vacaticm armedwith a \"Vhlued Clarification Packet.\", In this packet were ihcluded materialswhich the student would use in the two days of exercises eith the' cotihsolors.On :the COve,842 and\"Cc:gat of, priorities were li\u00e9ted 'and rated, .forced-decislon exercise 1444 used, a career awarenessf-cirm wts filled Out by .eachstudent, and a \"use:of leisure time\" form was-developed.,In the last sesSion-With, the couveiors, each student selected three repre7.sehtstivms by Whom he/she would like tOleginterviewed.- The interviewers *WOrepresentative of business, educat4on, AAR Services, Emplayment pcurity,Com-'mission and Apprenticeship, ProgpeSs. ,Each student was assured that he/she wouldreceive one of the ,three choicei.It was also pointed out thaS al/ seniors WOuldexperience at least two interviewing sessions Of 12'minptel each. reigity#0,many had thies interviews.) It was made clear to the,:stidesti that noemployers:Were coming here with job offers s that this was to be:pure* on.experiahce.in.562 Li17-1r,h 41int/viewing.It was also stated that if bY chance a'student impresped an em-Nwer.favorably that any.forthcoming future job offer would be up to theimpibyer.The English teacbers returnedotoo their role an the thit4d day and spent thehrieting and distussing with their students thekinterviewing process, the.selling of oneself, the \"how to\" of Seeking employment.' Also, thei began forialinstruction in the writing of a tesumit..' These were written by the student inhis/her own handwriting., AOrethe following Mondaf, ail senion4English classes met in the group gull-dance rool,where counselor showed them a professionally prepared don'ts\" of intecviewing.A discussion.and role playint ewer-cises'made this a meaningful sestion. While the teachers were conducting the above in-class program, the Guidance'4.personnel was involved in the monumental,task of juggling 321studdits with 467-interviewers. We strove to give each student at least one..interview of his/herChoice.Two-or three classes were scheduled during five regular school Reriods,with 'an average of 65-70 students per:perio#, .By a serfiessof crots-checrint,methods, we final/ted our schedules of interviews, prepOring a master sheet foteach interfyieWer and an ifidividuarsaledule card for each,interviewee. Theinterview assignments were given tothe students on the.day prior tothe interviews. The method of.scheduling was explaintd and final questions were tariswered.Where pospible, a fei changes were made,at thttime -'froM Offilbe PraCtice did muCh of the preliminary typing' and collating of materialsand firldd the senior, placement folders.The'card tables were borrowed frost, SLneighboring school;Akchairs were brought in by outs maintenance crew; and theKiy clu1 thember401a^fie job of setting up th'e tables and chairs according toa floor plan. 0May 7 dawnedas'another Vital spring day ond the sottLity within the school'sgymnasium was just as vibranf as the day.By 8:30 A.M. the interviewers had madetheir appearance and.were enjoying coffee and donuts which had.been prepared bythe HomeEconbmics students. At thii time, Asiistant ofCareer plucation Portladd, briefed the business people.The gym wasset upto,provids(46 interviewing stations with numbers correspbnding to thek appointment cards which each student had.- The interview .S'eSsionS' were divided into five 45 minuise sessions. ..As eachstudent entered,the aiea, he/she was provicte4 for those students,Who were mot ,being interviewed-at the.time.

A break of twentyminuted allowed the interviewers to enjoy an attimective buffet, again'Provided bYthe Home Economics students. The Key Clubbers were on the Scene to,remtive anreturn the borrowed chairs and tables as soon as the_activity ended. Within ahalf hour, the gym hid been restored to its original condition.Coverage was provided by a local TV station as well as two local newspapers.,This coverage was most positive, with the introductor Y Statement that \"SouthPortland does it again\" opening the local 6:00 P.M. news report..Immediately following the student involvement, on-the-spbt rap sessionswere conducted with the personnel people.Mr. Freise led the discussion andgathered input from the participants. The following day, a follow-Up form wasdistributed to all senior students. The redults of the follow-up indicated over-whelming suppbrt in all the phases of the lead-up and interviewing exercises,with recommendations to continue the program.for future classes. This was the most positive activity for the Career Education program 'to'date.The huge success of this activity is attributed to superior cooperation.Our local business and educational community, which was contacted by Mr. Freise,was most generous with time and efforts.Back up peoOle for possible cancellationswere available and filled in as needed. the gohool administration was helpful inhelping us coordinate classes to permit studtuts the time to participate. The.gym instructors relinquished the gym for the day and made alternate plans fortheir classes..The faculty and students made this one of the most exciting pro-grams of the year. Key words are\"000peration,\"'\"coordination\" and \"involvement.\"'lte-In conclusion, many fine things emerged from this process. The goal of pro-moting a meaningful, real life situation and providing the necessarY'PreParationfor the activity was achieved with much successMany students And interviewers ,made promising contacts, ancl, aa a result, some siudents-received offers for both -permanent and summer employment. As a resulti.of Senior Career Day, mostwseniorsare lessapprehensive about approaching interviews-for real job,openings. Theyunderstand themselves And their goals a little better, because they were providedthe opportunity to think about them.They will approach an interview knowingthat \"bUtterflies\" are.a natural part of facing a Strange situation, but securein knowing that personnel people are especially trained to.put a person at easeand that, if one comes to an intervieW prepared, there is nothing to fear. .564 -Andre HemondDirector of GuidanceSouth-yortiand High 0 .0ectUnIt,iilCourse . .......146 Anti-Hero in American Literature(11,12).,175;Historical Novels -yilabus CC ....'History of Our Schools.
