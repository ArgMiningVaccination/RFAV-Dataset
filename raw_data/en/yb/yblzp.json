UNDERSTANDING \"THE STORY\" As with all homeopathic case-taking, the need to understand the story of a person is vital where surgical trauma is impacting current states-of-health. When and how did it happen, what was the context in the lead up to i, what interventions did you receive, how did you you respond at the time and what changed after and since then? We soon learn that the insomnia occurred after an upsetting dental extraction, that the underactive thyroid coincided with a medicalised birth while the child with extreme separation anxiety regained consciousness post general anaesthetic, alone in an empty room four years previous. The homeopathic approach to these personal stories is through individualised treatment. While expressions of the psyche - fears, anxieties, detachment, feelings of helplessness and humiliation for instance help us to gain insight into what it is like for this person to be in the world holding these patterns, they are inseparable to what is taking place physically in the body. The stomach ulcers, thyroid imbalance or interstitial cystitis will speak the grief, anger or fear that the individual may be unable to articulate. The body will always express its experience through metaphor, namely the manifesting of signs and symptoms mentally, emotionally, physically. The homeopathic approach to addressing trauma is particularly helpful when someone is unaware that they have been affected. Afterall the very nature of shock engenders detachment, abuse is often buried, grief suppressed and for those who have experienced trauma at birth - \"not knowing\" of any other way. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF MEDICAL INTERVENTIONS Taking a person's \"case\" is a detailed process and one that pivots on the building of a timeline. How someone presents is the result of the sequence of events that have taken place throughout their lives, from a holistic lens there is no delineation between the trauma that happened at birth or the traumatic tonsillectomy at seven years old to what is presenting now. Again we need to adopt whole-person, holistic thinking when it comes to case-taking. A key aspect to understanding this is assessing the types of medical interventions that have been encountered from anaesthetics to steroids, MRI scans to lumbar punctures. The effects of radiation, magnetic imaging, lasers, medications, even the \"surgeon's knife\" will in themselves embed suppressive layers through the system that can directly block healing. In my practice I address these layers directly with tautopathic prescriptions namely using the drug, chemical or toxin in homeopathic potency from steroids to general anaesthetics, MRI to x-ray. Remedies can literally be made from any substance, through potentisation and dilution the most poisonous is transformed in to a medicine that can heal. Tautopathic prescribing is essentially healing the wound made by the arrow with the arrow itself. These are complex prescriptions which involve constitutional, miasmatic, organ supportive, tautopathic and trauma remedies seemingly the opposite to classical homeopathy yet often essential in moving an individual in to that elegant - one remedy and wait state-of-health. PRESCRIBING FOR ACUTE TRAUMA Homeopathy is well-known for the many remedies called for in first aid situations, working to help facilitate the healing of wounds, burns, bruises and broken bones. Home prescribers will be aware of the defining qualities that help determine the most appropriate prescription - Arnica the dull shock of a sledge hammer, Aconite the intensity of a pick-axe. Well chosen remedies prescribed in acute situations at the right times can avert trauma from embedding itself in to the system, however when a chronic pattern is established the comprehensive work of constitutional prescribing is required. THE EFFECTS OF TRAUMA ON THE PSYCHE Surgical trauma can establish profound disturbances in the psyche, the helplessness of being raced in to emergency after a car accident, the pain and inability to move while a team of medics attempt to save life. The grumbling appendix that has finally ruptured followed by a brutalising surgical experience that has left one unable to urinate properly. The oral surgery that has in someway reignited past trauma of abuse resulting in the individual being panicked and restless in the years since. Anxiety, feelings of powerlessness and humiliation are common patterns of distress and dis-ease resulting from trauma and often where medical interventions are a distinctive feature. Below you will find some keynotes of the main remedies that may be considered in such cases. WORKING WITH POTENCY Given the intensity and depth that trauma can reside in the system an understanding of homeopathic potencies is often key to successful prescribing.
