Period. End of story. If they want an extension, itshould be to build a closed loop system. They had years to prepare this, to work with thegovernment, the industry and the community to get this right and they were silent for the first3 years and then came out saying No pipe, no mill.

I feel NP has done their homework for this project and have presented the bestreplacement solution for Boat Harbour. Effluent has been pouring into the NorthumberlandStrait for 50 years with no harmful effects on the environment or the fishing industry. Now in2019, NP will be using the best technology available for bleach kraft pulp mills in the worldwhich will meet or excede provincial and federal guidelines for the environment.They havedone 28 studies for the Government with consultation from the Environment,TransportCanada,Fisheries and Oceans and many other departments. They crossed all the Is and Tsnecessary to be awarded an Environmental permit to procede with the construction andcompletion of the project to replace Boat Harbour. When completed there be safe guards inplace to protect the environment and to continue to let the forest industry and fishery industryco-exist like they have in the past. I hope you will grant this permit to build this treatmentplant as 12,000 jobs associated with the Mill are at risk as well as the economies of Pictou,Colchester, Cumberland Counties and the economy of our Province. The science is there toback this Mega project. Hopefully, calm and cool heads will look at this project which hasturned into such a contentious issue when there is no need for it. I have no doubt in my mindwhen your Department looks at all the scientific data and studies by NP it will be a no brainerto approve the permit.

Though a short extension on boat harbour may be needed to do this right From: To: Environment Assessment Web Account Subject: Proposed Project Comments Date: Thursday, February 07, 2019 12:09:17 PM Project: replacement_effluent_treatment_facility_project Comments: As a Pictou County Resident, a provincial tax payer, and most importantly, a father of three , I find it appalling that we are even contemplating allowing this Industry to dump toxic effluent into the Northumberland Strait in the hopes that dilution is a viable a solution.Northern Pulp continuously says the effluent is already going into the Strait, but fail tomention that that only happens after sitting for a month or more in a 300 acre tidal estuarywhich acts as a natural filter. The proof of Boat Harbours filtering ability lie in the sheer effortit will take to clean that environmental disaster up, and even after all that effort and money, itwill never be the same. There seems to be a lot of focus on the people that will be forced tomove away for work, however there also should be a focus on the young families who willchoose to move away, or never relocate here in the first place should this proposal be allowedto go through. There are many of us that are not interested in being poisoned for the sake ofAsia Pulp and Papers profit. Its time to think about the future, and dumping at minimum, 50-60 million liters per day of pulp waste into the Northumberland Strait, jeopardizing a moreprofitable fishing industry as well as severely limiting tourism and growth in the surroundingareas, is doing the exact opposite of that. As we move into the future there will be an evengreater focus on environmental sustainability. Nova Scotia should be looking to invest inbeing a leader in that area, not taking significant steps backward in time.

Let the science decide not peer pressure from the public on either side of theargument. There is a lot at stake here and I fear the decision will be based on whatever willgain the most votes. If the science displays the mill will produce an effluent that is better thanit currently is and it will meet all the current regulations and the new regulations coming downsoon it should be allowed to run. If the effluent is going to be worse than the current systemthen that\u00e2?Ts a different story. A lot of locals are uneducated and very determined to stop thisproject due to lack of knowledge and poor communication at all levels. We need a governmentthat will take an unbiased stance on this and think of the whole province. The governmentmust do the right thing and protect the environment and the economy.rely on the experts, dothe right thing. Keep this province working. Currently all political parties have been playingpolitics on this matter and not taking a side. A lot of forestry families need a government thatwill be straight up and honest. Families are leaving this province and many are making plansto leave. This is no time for games. If the science works approve the project and let thesefamilies know they have a future here in Nova Scotia.

From: To: Environment Assessment Web Account Subject: Feedback opposing the Northern Pulp Waste Proposal Date: Thursday, February 07, 2019 2:18:23 PM Attachments: ambient air study.pdf NS Department of Environment and Premier McNeil, I believe that the proposed effluent project SHOULD NOT be approved for the following reasons : 1. The proposed waste process is not better than the current waste process Some say, \"the effluent has been going out into the Strait for years anyway. \" This is only partially true. A study conducted in 2005 showed that healthy mussels deployed into the Pictou Harbour and exposed to mill effluent and untreated municipal sewage for 6 months had developed leukemia. Another study showed that the effluent had never been flushing properly with a large amount settling back into Pictou Harbour. Because the old system was never flushing properly, most of the effluent has been confined to the local shoreline and has been flowing back into Pictou Harbour,rather than into the Strait. This was a good thing for the Strait, but not for area residents, especially Pictou Landing First Nation. In Northern Pulp's proposed new system, waste water would go straight out from the new Abercrombie Point treatment facility into \"deeper waters. \"This could result in the pollutants affecting a far wider area because of \"improved flushing.\" Old Waste Process Northern Pulp's proposed new effluent treatment facility differs from the present facility in anumber of ways. In the present system, untreated effluent is piped from the mill to the north settling ponds at Boat Harbour, where it remains for 12 hours for primary treatment. It then movesto an aerated stabilization basin where effluent is placed in contact with micro-organisms. The effluent remains there for 8 days for secondary treatment. After 8 days, the effluent is discharged from the aeration basin at what is known as Point C, and treatment is considered finished. At point C, samples are taken for testing to determine whether the treated effluent meets regulations. After point C, the effluent enters the 300-acre Boat Harbour lagoon, also known as Boat Harbour Basin. Boat Harbour Basin was initially used as a stand-alone effluent treatment facility. In 1972, settling ponds and an aerated stabilization basin were constructed to meet stricter regulations for pulpeffluent treatment. Additional aeration and other upgrades were added from 1992-1996, as the federal government again adopted stricter regulations. The lagoon at Boat Harbour has not beenofficially part of the effluent treatment system since 1972. Official or not, treated effluent remains inthe lagoon for an additional 20-30 days. Further aeration, settling, cooling, volatilization and breakdown of materials takes place during that time. This is referred to as \"polishing\" or tertiary treatment. Natural springs and surface run off further dilute the effluent. According to Northern Pulp's figures, during the time in Boat Harbour Basin, total suspended solids (TSS) and biochemicaloxygen demand (BOD) decrease up to 30%, before the effluent flows out at the shore edge of theStrait at Point D. NOTE : Northern Pulp's effluent meets the regulations at Point C in the above process. Point C is also now a DEAD ZONE. Northern Pulp's own reports say that they release over 1000 kg (one metric ton) of suspended solids in their waste water each day. Test results have revealed the presence of dioxins, furans, chlorinated compounds, halogenated organic compounds and traces of heavy metals. Thesesubstances are known to have negative impacts to aquatic life. The study prepared for Northern Pulpby engineering consultants KSH Solutions Inc. clearly shows that there will be very little change in wastewater quality with the new AST facility The Proposed Waste Proposal In the proposed new Activated Sludge Treatment (AST) system on the mill site, effluent will move through a primary clarifier to an aeration basin using micro-organisms to break down pollutants, andthen to a secondary clarifier. The process will take less than 24 hours. Therefore it will not have the 300 acre lagoon to provide further aeration, settling, cooling,volatilization and breakdown of materials that takes place during that time. This is referred to as\"polishing\" or tertiary treatment. That is one of the main reasons why the proposed system is notbetter since it doesn't have the time like the old process to settle, cool down, become furtherdiluted etc. Northern Pulp states that effluent from the new system, including an added oxygen delignification system (confirmed from mill execs that it will not be ready for the proposed launch of the neweffluent system and does not have a timeline), will be similar to treated effluent leaving the presentsystem at point C, with some (unspecified) reduction in biochemical oxygen demand (BOD.) 2. Additional Air Quality Issues The new proposal also shows a plan to burn contaminated sludge in power boiler which raises newthreats to air quality. The waste sludge contains toxins which would be released through the stacks of the mill's power boiler. The proposal is to \"dewater the sludge prior to mixing it with bark and other woodwaste for combustion in the mill's power boiler.\" This is the same power boiler that is currently and repeatedly failing stack emissions tests. Problems with air quality from mill emissions have been documented for years. Lack of appropriate monitoring and enforcement already puts area residents at risk. Now, Northern Pulp is considering adding sludge containing toxins to the combustion mix, increasing health risks from NP's air emission Recently a group of scientists decided to measure the levels of VOCs (volatile organic compounds) in Pictou County with an ambient air monitor. They chose Granton as the location and they found that when the mill blew toward the monitoring station that the cancer risk thresholds for VOC levelswere exceeded. They also studied the seasonal wind directions and determined that the mill mostlyblew in other directions where no monitoring stations were ever located to measure VOC levels. Thestudy concludes by recommending that monitoring stations should be installed in higher populatedareas such as the town of Pictou where exposure is greater. But instead of installing more monitoring stations to measure VOC levels the Provincial Government removed the monitoringstation in Granton. The VOC monitoring station in Granton was decommissioned - An email response from NSE (Nova Scotia Environment) states \"Environment Canada decided to decommission the Granton VOC monitor in 2015 after they analyzed the 10 years of data anddetermined there were no pollutants of concern in the area\" - Yet this attached study iscontradictory to the findings of this ambient air study. According to the NPRI data on Environment Canada's website the VOC levels were not reduced since the installation of the new precipitator at Northern Pulp. The precipitator is designed to filter out visible particulate but does not lower the VOC levels. So Northern Pulp is still currently releasing cancer causing levels of VOCs and we can only assume this would become much worse once theywould begin to burn their dried up waste sludge in their already failing power boiler. The study shows that VOC levels (volatile organic compounds) in the air around Pictou County \"exceeded their respective cancer risk thresholds and are of primary health concern in terms ofpopulation risk. Results highlight associations with wind direction and the Granton NAPS site's ambient VOC concentrations in relation to location of the pulp mill\"But most importantly the study revealed that there are no monitoring stations located in many of the populated areas that are susceptible to the pollution coming from the mill - \"Findings suggest that Granton's NAPS site is not positioned to accurately represent ambient levels of toxidity in PC.\"And the study concludes that NSE should install the proper monitoring stations such as in Pictouwhere there is \"higher residential exposure\". This should also include places like New Glasgow, Trenton, Pictou Landing, Westville, Stellarton and other areas around the County where thepopulation is being exposed. Northern Pulp also doesn't have \"Continual Emissions Monitoring\" CEM on all of their stacks like other mills in Canada are required to do with live streaming to a website for everyone to see exactly what chemical compounds are being released and whether or not they are surpassing the riskthresholds. Since this study was done (and since the new precipitator was installed), the NPRI data on the Environment Canada's website shows very little change in the amounts of VOCs being emitted to thepresent day. AND for some reason the Granton VOC air monitoring station was decommissionedapproximately three years ago. From NPRI data - Northern Pulp's Self Reported VOC Levels from 2010-2016: 2010 - 118 2011 - 108 2012 - 143 2013 - 144 2014 - 140 2015 - 132 2016 - 136 See Volatile organic compounds http://ec.gc.ca/inrp-npri/donnees-data/index.cfm... In light of this new information about high cancer causing VOC levels coming from the mill, several monitoring stations would be required because readings from any one monitoring station will only detect pollutants from the mill if the wind happens to be blowing that way - the mill is the pointsource. An even better solution would be the mill having continuous air monitoring (CEM) on each of the three main stacks with set limits monitored by a third party and real time data made availableto the public. Another study in 2008 shows Pictou County had the highest rates of cancer in Nova Scotia with stillbirths and infant deaths amongst the highest in the province. 3. Bleach Chlorine Mills and the Impacts on Marine Life The molecular chlorine or chlorine-containing compounds currently used as bleaching agents by the pulp and paper sector react with materials released from wood during the pulping process, resultingin the formation of chlorinated organic compounds which are in part discharged into the aquaticenvironment via effluents. Canadian mills are estimated to use over 610 000 tonnes of chlorine annually to produce over 10 million tonnes of bleached pulp and to release over a million tonnes ofchlorinated organic compounds to the aquatic environment. The dioxins and furans are part of the bleaching process and are considered \"toxic\" under Sections 11(a) and 11(c) of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act and Ibelieve the Federal Government has more expertise and resources to asses this compared to the province. TSS and BOD are regulated under Sections 34 and 36 of the Fisheries Act which is aFederal act thus requiring Federal involvement. The chemical composition of bleached pulp mill effluents is variable and not wellcharacterized. Approximately 250 compounds have been identified in bleacheryeffluents but many more remain unidentified. Thus, substantial quantities of chlorinated organic compounds, both of known and of unknown composition, enterthe Canadian aquatic environment from bleached pulp mill discharges. Many of these chlorinated organic compounds are persistent and have been detectedin water, sediments and biota up to 1400 km from bleached pulp mills outfalls.Compounds with low chlorine substitution degrade within hours to days, whereashighly chlorinated organic compounds may persist from days to weeks or longer.Persistence may be longer in winter, especially under ice. Some chlorinated organiccompounds can be biologically degraded or transformed and transformation may leadto more persistent and bioaccumulative compounds. Chloroveratroles, for example, transformation products of chloroguaiacols which areunique to bleached pulp mill effluents, are capable of accumulating in fish up to 25 000times the concentration in water. Some other chlorinated organic compounds detected in biological tissues downstreamof bleached pulp mills reflect repeated or long-term exposure rather than highbioaccumulative potentials. Seventy-five percent of Canadian bleached pulp mills discharge effluents that areacutely lethal to fish, sometimes at concentrations as low as 3.2% effluent. A fewindividual chlorinated organic compounds in these effluents approach or surpassconcentrations that cause mortalities in aquatic organisms ranging from algae to fish. Seventy percent of Canadian freshwater bleached pulp mills discharge whole effluentthat, even upon dilution by the receiving waters, are at levels which cause chroniceffects. Chronic effects, such as reproductive anomalies, biochemical changes, andbehavioural alterations in aquatic organisms, have been observed in Canadian fieldstudies at 0.5 to 5 % whole effluent. Laboratory studies using individual chlorinated organic compounds that are commonly discharged from bleached pulp mills have demonstrated such chronic effects asdeformities, and embryo and larval mortalities in fish. These chronic effects includesignificant irreversible factors which jeopardize the continuance of the species and theintegrity of the ecosystem. Thus, the levels of whole effluents discharged fromCanadian bleached pulp mills to the aquatic environment and the resulting acute and chronic effects observed both in the field and in the laboratory combine to represent asignificant risk to the aquatic ecosystem. Supporters of piping the effluent into the Strait say waste water will be diluted in the larger body of water, so the effluent will not cause harm to the fisheries or the larger environment. But that's not accurate. Even diluted, the toxins can have serious effects on aquatic life and the overall environment. Levels may be low at any one moment, but cumulative impacts over the longer termwould have negative effects on aquatic life and the aquatic environment. In the case of NP's effluent, the volume of contaminants contained in the waste effluent is significant. Studies show that exposure even to low concentrations of heavy metals and other chemicals over time can disruptreproduction, weight gain, and food sources of aquatic life. Also, bioaccumulation of toxins including heavy metals in aquatic species is of great concern. Northern Pulp's proposal boasts about using an Activated Sludge Treatment (AST) effluent treatment system similar to the system used at Port Hawkesbury Paper for their treatment facility but it ignoresthe differences between the mills. Both mills produce pulp, but PHP is a thermomechanical pulp (TMP) mill, while NP is a chemical bleached kraft mill. Port Hawkesbury Paper uses peroxide bleach and thermo-mechanical refining (no chemicals) to break down the lignin in wood fiber to produce pulp. Northern Pulp uses chemicals to produce pulp,plus additional chemicals to bleach the pulp. Northern Pulp bleaches with chlorine dioxide (ECF), andwhile, switching to ECF was an improvement from an older method used pre-1997, it does noteliminate the presence of dioxins, furans or other toxins in the effluent. NOTE: Environment Canada has \"Effluents From Pulp Mills Using Bleaching\" listed as a toxic substance. This includes any mills still utilizing a chlorine or chlorine dioxide process. NP does nothave an oxygen delignification system as most other modern pulp mills do. Oxygen delignification aids in reducing chemical usage and environmental impact. In addition, many mills recycle water,while NP does not. A chemical-bleached kraft mill like Northern Pulp produces approximately 4 times more wastewater than Port Hawkesbury Paper. NP's waste water contains toxins that are not found in PHP's waste water, or in the waste water of most mills using AST systems that employ the use of oxygendelignification and recycle water. The new system proposed by Northern Pulp for treating effluent would use a multi-stage process to separate liquids and solids and then aerate. The wastewaterwould still contain toxic chemicals and traces of heavy metals which would accumulate at the 'pointsource' outflow location in the Strait. 4. The Northumberland Strait - Depth and Ice Scouring The Strait is shallow and ice scouring occurs in the Winter. This presents a huge risk for the effluent pipe to get damaged. The Stantec Receiving Water Report calls this out - The general information provided below was obtained from the Canadian Coast Guard on Ice Climatology and EnvironmentalConditions (CCG, 2012). Generally, or normally, the first ice formation in the Gulf of St. Lawrenceoccurs in the St. Lawrence River in early to mid-December and progressively moves to SaguenayRiver and then forms along the coast of New Brunswick and progressively moves eastward. In January, the ice concentrations have reached very closepack range in the Northumberland Strait. By the end of February, thin first-year ice may be found in the Northumberland Strait. It is emphasized, however, that ice conditions in the Northumberland Strait are highly variable and the ice covervaries considerably from year-toyear. There have been years when the entire Strait is frozen and totally ice-covered, while other years the Strait is relatively ice-free. It is quite possible for drift ice to be blown into the shore with winds outof the north. There is also the possibility of some ice-rafting along Nova Scotia's Northumberlandshore where ice sheets over-ride each other and stack-up along the shore. Fast ice (ice which forms and remains fast along the coast) for most coastal regions in the Gulf has limited extents as it formsin smaller bays and inlets which might be more typical and expected in Pictou Harbour (ENSR 1999). The 1999 ENSR report included a review of available ice data for the Pictou area including consultation with researchers and review of published literature. It was determined that quantitative data in Pictou Road and Pictou Harbour was unavailable, while ice in theNorthumberland Strait has been measured and studied extensively. Of particular interest were theevents of ice scouring as it is well known that pipelines, outfalls, diffusers, and submarine cables areat risk during ice scour events. It was reported (in ENSR, 1999) that Maritime Telephone and Telegraph (MT&T) performed an ice evaluation in support of an optical communication cable deployment across the NorthumberlandStrait. Based on MT&T's review, the estimated potential for damage to the cable from ice scour extended to water depths of 12 to 14 m. In 1991 their cable was trenched and buried to a selected depth (depth is unknown) and left on the surface of the sea bottom at greater depths. Unfortunately, the winter of 1991/1992 was severe and the cable was severed by ice keels at a water depth greater than 18 m towards the Woods Island, PEI side of the Northumberland Strait. Based on the above, substantial ice pile-up should be expected near shore of the Northumberland Strait and ice scour is possible and should be anticipated anywhere in Pictou Road and theNorthumberland Strait area. Available information suggests that there is a potential for damage to the pipe, outfall, and diffusers in the areas of Pictou Road out into the Northumberland Strait, basedon ENSR (1999) 5. The Northumberland Strait Cannot withstand Additional Pressures The Northumberland Strait Ecosystem Overview Report, prepared for DFO in 2007, documentsincreasing stresses on the Strait. \"Increased nutrient loading from land-based activities wasidentified as the most important MEQ [Marine Environment Quality] issue in the near shore areassuch as the estuaries, harbours, and bays. The principal sources of nutrients to the coastal areas ofthe Northumberland Strait are sewage, agricultural runoff, fish plant effluents, and pulp milleffluent.\" The Ecosystem Overview Report also states, \"In addition to individual impacts of the various elements identified as having an impact on the environment in the Northumberland Strait,there can be cumulative impacts that exceed the individual effects.\" Ocean stresses are increasing generally. Anoxic areas, where there is insufficient oxygen for marine life, are growing, and are expected to continue to do so due to global warming and other factors. The discharge of pulp effluent, with significant amounts of total suspended solids, biochemical oxygen demand, chemicaloxygen demand and contaminants including heavy metals and AOX, has to be evaluated in thecontext of cumulative impacts on an increasingly stressed ecosystem. The consequences will begreater now and in coming decades than they would have been 50 or 25 years ago in healthieroceans. 6. Weak Regulations Pulp and Paper Effluent Regulations (PPER) in Canada cover two matters; total suspended solids (TSS) and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD.) Even though total discharges of TSS and BOD in pulpand paper effluent decreased by approximately 90% and 97% respectively from 1970-2008, pulp milleffluents continue to have harmful impacts on fish, fish habitat and the environment. Information gathered through environmental effects monitoring (EEM) at all Canadian mills points to thedisturbing conclusion that although mills are meeting regulations and passing the PPER toxicity test,70% are having harmful effects on aquatic life and habitat, and 55% are having harmful effects onthe larger environment. This information led the federal department of Environment and Climate Change to undertake amodernization review of pulp and paper effluent regulations in 2017. \"Results from EEM studies and the changing realities of the pulp and paper industry indicate a need to modernize the PPER to improve environmental protection,\" the department states. If meeting regulations is not enough to prevent harm, neither is passing toxicity tests. Only one toxicity test is required under Canadian pulp and paper regulations. The required LC-50 test is for acute lethality. For this test, an effluent isconsidered acutely lethal if the treated effluent at 100% concentration kills more than 50% of theRainbow Trout exposed to it during a 96-hour period. Long-term effects, including impacts on reproduction or growth, cumulative impacts on fish habitat and the larger environment or accumulation of substances harmful for human consumption are not regulated under the PPER.Testing for environmental effects is required for information purposes. Only two mills in Canada test for and report impacts of effluent on the usability of fish resources by humans. Effluent from pulp and paper mills is regulated at the federal level principally by the Pulp and Paper Effluent Regulations (PPER), which form part of the Fisheries Act. The standards that applyto pulp effluent today were adopted in 1992 and have remained unchanged for 25 years. Highlytoxic dioxins and furans are regulated under a separate Act. 70% of pulp & paper mills are having harmful effects on aquatic life and habitat despite meeting current regulations . Long term impacts on reproduction and growth are not regulated under PPER. Federal regulations cover only a few of the recognized harmful substances in pulp mill effluent. For example, there are no federal regulations for AOX compounds, a component of pulp effluent in millsthat bleach with chlorine or a chlorine compound. AOX compounds are recognized as extremelytoxic. They are not easily broken down by bacteria and thus bioaccumulate in the environment. Yet they are not included in PPER regulations. Neither are phenols, toluene, chloroform or chemical oxygen demand (COD). For 25 yrs the regulations that apply to pulp effluent have remained unchanged. Provinces may go beyond Federal standards and adopt stricter regulations for effluent from pulp mills. British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario and Quebec have adopted stricter regulations. Nova Scotia does not have regulations, but sets limits through individual industrial approvals. The EU has more protectiveregulations than Canada does. 7. Effluent Make up Unknown Hot water is a hazard to marine environment. NP presently releases 80 to 90 million litres ofwastewater per day. This waste currently enters Boat Harbour at a temperature of approximately 40degrees . A cooling tower as proposed by NP for its new treatment facility should lower waste effluent temperature to 32-36 degrees C. This would represent a 20 to 28-degree C water shock to marine life, if this water entered a marine habitat. This thermal shock would kill any marine life within meters of the discharge point. This thermal loading should be contrary to the Fisheries Act. Yet this issue is not addressed in KSH's design proposal for a new facility. There is no plan to bringwastewater to within 1 to 5 degrees of the natural habitat. Further to this, Northern Pulp has been unable to release the exact composition of this proposed effluent. 8. Economics The Nova Scotia Economy exports $1.5 Billion dollars worth of Shellfish per year. Shellfish that are caught in the Strait are sold under the \"Atlantic Canadian\" brand. Contamination of even a few shellfish would destroy the excellent reputation Atlantic Canada has in regards to this resource. Theresults for Atlantic Canada would be catastrophic. Examples of similar situations would be: 1. In 2003, one case of mad cow disease was discovered in Alberta. The result, it collapsed the Canadian Beef market. 2. In 2018, a trace of GMO Wheat that came from Canada was discovered in Asia. The result, Asia declared they no longer would buy wheat from Canada until the issue was addressed. Besides the $2 Billion dollar Commercial Fishery in NS, The Northumberland Strait also employs a lot of people in Tourism. There are 3200 jobs in this industry along the Strait that generates $200 Million in revenue and brings in about $24 Million in Tax Revenue. In addition to those two industries, The NS Sportfishing industry is growing and more emphasis is being placed on attracting Fishers from outside our Province. This industry is currently worth $65 Million dollars to the economy, with the Strait bringing in a big piece of that. The Strait has 15 + rivers that come in off of the Strait that all have world class Atlantic Salmon, Brook Trout and BrownTrout. These species are considered in the top 5 in the world for Sport Fish. 9. Pictou Town Water Supply Although very little info has been released by Northern Pulp on this, the latest proposed route showthe effluent pipe going through the Pictou Town water supply. Should this pipe be compromised like it has multiple times with the current waste prices, the Pictou Town water supply would becomecontaminated. 10. Marine Protected Area The receiving water area is part of a Marine Protected Area and a scallop buffer zone. 11. Trust/History Northern Pulp has had over a dozen infractions since 2014 and 2 very large effluent spills that they did not report in a timely manner nor in an accurate manner per the Federal judge presiding over one of these spills 12. Federal Fishing Zone The receiving water area is part of a Federal fishing zone and shared by 3 Provinces. 13. Pictou Landing First Nations The Aboriginal rights of PLFN need to be considered. The new discharge location still has a direct affect on them and their livelihood, as it pertains to fishing. 14. Species at Risk and Species of Concern There are 'Species at Risk' that potentially will be negatively affected via this effluent pipe duringconstruction as well as at the outflow. They are listed on the DFO and NS websites. 15. Wild life Sanctuary The proposed discharge location is directly adjacent to Caribou-Munroe's Island Park; a bird andwildlife sanctuary. Thank you for this opportunity to provide my feedback. I look forward to the results of a thoroughreview. Sincerely, RESEARCH ARTICLE Pilot study investigating ambient air toxics emissions near a Canadian kraft pulp and paper facility in Pictou County,Nova Scotia Emma Hoffman1&Judith July 2017 #Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany 2017 Abstract Air toxics are airborne pollutants known or suspected to cause cancer or other serious health effects, in- cluding certain volatile organic compounds (VOCs), priori- tized by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). While several EPA-designated air toxics are monitored at a subset of Canadian National Air Pollution Surveillance (NAPS) sites, Canada has no specific Bair toxics ^control pri- orities. Although pulp and paper (P&P) mills are major indus- trial emitters of air pollutants, few studies quantified the spec- trum of air quality exposures. Moreover, most NAPS moni-toring sites are in urban centers; in contrast, rural NAPS sites are sparse with few exposure risk records. The objective of this pilot study was to investigate prioritized air toxic ambientVOC concentrations using NAPS hourly emissions data from a rural Pictou, Nova Scotia Kraft P&P town to document concentration levels, and to determine whether these concen-trations correlated with wind direction at the NAPS site (lo- cated southwest of the mill). Publicly accessible Environment and Climate Change Canada data (VOC concentrations[Granton NAPS ID: 31201] and local meteorological condi- tions [Caribou Point]) were examined using temporal (2006 - 2013) and spatial analytic methods. Results revealed severalVOCs (1,3-butadiene, benzene, and carbon tetrachloride) rou- tinely toxics-associated cancer and tetrachloroethylene were significantly higher ( p< 0.05) when prevailing wind direction blew from the northeast and the mill towards the NAPS site. Conversely,when prevailing winds originated from the southwest towards the mill, higher median VOC air toxics concentrations at theNAPS site, except carbon tetrachloride, were not observed. Despite study limitations, this is one of few investigations documenting elevated concentrations of certain VOCs airtoxics to be associated with P&P emissions in a community. Findings support the need for more research on the extent to which air toxics emissions exist in P&P towns and contributeto poor health in nearby communities.

Cancer risk Introduction Poor ambient air quality is an increasing global concern with recent revelations that 92% of the world 'sp o p u l a t i o ni se x - posed to air pollution levels above the World Health Organization (WHO) air quality guidelines (WHO 2006, 2016; Kelly and Fussell 2015). Ambient air pollution is wide- ly recognized and increasingly associated with a wide range of acute and chronic adverse health effects, including cancer,cardiovascular, respiratory, and mortality outcomes (IOM 2011; Villeneuve et al. 2013;E C C C 2015a ). The pathological mechanisms by which these toxic exposures exert their effects are not well understood. WHO highlights the need for re- search in order to better inform exposure-response relation- ships (WHO 2016).Responsible editor: Constantini Samara Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s11356-017-9719-5 ) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users. *Emma Hoffman emma.hoffman@dal.ca 1School for Resource and Environmental Studies, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada 2Department of Community Health and Epidemiology, Dalhousie Halifax, Sci Pollut Res (2017) 24:20685 -20698 DOI 10.1007/s11356-017-9719-5 Most air pollution surveillance activities are limited to mea- surement of respirable fine particulate matter 2.5m (PM 2.5), without regard to their specific chemical composition and criterion air contaminant (CAC) gases (i.e., nitrogen ox- ides [NO x] and ground-level ozone [O 3]). There is growing concern about the toxicity of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) (Cicolella 2008) and the consequences of long-term, low-dose exposure to these agents. VOCs are varied and wide-spread air pollutants (e.g., hydrocarbons, aromatics, and somechlorinated compounds) that are increasingly recognized as important precursors to PM 2.5and ground-level O 3formation through photochemical reactions (Ryerson et al. 2001). Atmospheric deposition of VOCs may contaminate other en-vironmental media (e.g., soils, sediments, and (ATSDR 2014a ; MacAskill et al. 2016). Many VOCs are included in the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Bair toxics ^ list.BAir toxics ^are defined as Bthose pollutants that cause or may cause cancer or other serious health effects [ ...]o ra d - verse environmental and ecological effects ^(EPA 2015a ). According to the Canadian Environmental Protection Act 1999 (CEPA), VOC releases are acknowledged as a health concern, but, due to their highly volatile properties, are chal- lenging to monitor and manage (CCME 2011). Although no specific Canadian legislative or regulatory tools address am-bient VOC levels, emissions are indirectly controlled through regulatory mitigation of PM 2.5and ground-level O 3under the Canadian Ambient Air Quality Standards (CAAQS). Under CEPA, it is mandatory for owners or facility operators, who meet reporting requirements, to self-report pollutant releasesto air, water, and land to Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) 's National Pollutant Release Inventory (NPRI) (ECCC 2014). While this provides a disincentive to those industries releasing these agents, there is less regulatorycontrol or routine monitoring of these agents in Canada which, in turn, limits scientific understanding of sources, exposures,and the effectiveness of current control measures across the country. Ambient air monitoring in the US is conducted in accordance with the Clean Air Act (CAA) (Clean Air Act 1970). CAA amendments identify 187 air toxics, which form the basis for EPA 's approach to regulating emissions (EPA 2015a ). Of these, EPA identified 30 air toxics that pose the greatest potential health threat in urban areas (EPA 2015b). Although many CEPA-toxic or equivalent agents are monitored by the National Air Pollution Surveillance (NAPS) network, it includes a selection (not all) of EPA 's list of prioritized air toxics, and the main criteria for air toxics monitoring in Canada has been their potential contribution to ambient PM and ground-level O 3(Galarneau et al. 2016 ). Consequently, there are gaps in understanding of air toxics concentrations across the NAPS network. Using the risk-based principles outlined in CAA, EPAdeveloped the National Air Toxics Assessment (NATA), a comprehensive evaluation tool that prioritizes efforts to regulate emissions of air toxics (EPA 2015c ). Such a rigorous initiative has yet to be implemented in Canada, where no federal guidelines exist for ambient air toxics. Despite economic benefits of the P&P industry, it generates large quantities of atmosphe ric and effluent emissions, resulting in environmental degradation (Hewitt et al. 2006; Hoffman et al. 2015; Hoffman et al. 2017). P&P mill emis- sions vary depending on the pulping method, wood species,and by the age and technology used (Soskolne and Sieswerda2010). P&P mills are industrial emitters of air toxics, although few investigations (e.g., the Nez Perce National Air ToxicsProgram, funded by EPA [STI 2009]) have characterized am- bient concentrations in nearby communities. Potential adverse health effects associated with expo- sure to air pollutants in the vicinity and downwind fromP&P facilities include respiratory disease, neurophysical symptoms, and higher risks of contracting lung cancer (Soto et al. 1991; Toren et al. 1996 ; Mirabelli and Wing 2006 ). Yet, few investigations reported adverse health effects from chronic community-level ambient exposuresto P&P mills emissions in Canada (Mirabelli and Wing 2006; Soskolne and Sieswerda 2010 ). While there have been a number of occupational epidemiological studies of P&P workers, these investigations have not been ex- tended to examine community exposures, due to re- search design challenges including ecological fallacy(i.e., inferences made about individuals deduced from the population) in community studies (Soskolne and Sieswerda 2010). Additionally, most of these studies focused on respiratory disease outcomes; there is a dearth of epidemiological studies of cardiovascular ef- fects or cancer effects in these communities. Decades-long concerns for perceived higher incidence and mortality rates for all-cause cancer, cardiovascular disease,chronic respiratory disease, and diabetes (Reid 1989; PCHA 2008;S t a t i s t i c sC a n a d a 2013) in PC, Nova Scotia, have gen- erated considerable community antipathy among residents to-wards a local P&P mill (Hoffman et al. 2015). This bleached kraft P&P mill ( Bthe mill ^) is located approximately 3 km south of the town of Pictou (population 3500) and producesapproximately 280,000 t of bleached kraft pulp annually fromsoftwood and hardwood chips (NP 2016b )( F i g . 1) and has been in production since 1967 (Ogden 1972). Public backlash gained momentum during 2014 due to the failure of the re-covery boiler electrostatic precipitator (i.e., particulate filtra- tion device). Environmental reporting by the mill, when compared against provincial and federal regulatory compliancestandards, contrasted to local perceptions of impacts. Most environmental monitoring reports indicated some20686 Environ Sci Pollut Res (2017) 24:20685 -20698level of compliance in atmospheric emissions, but when compliance targets were exceeded, there were inconsis-tent regulatory enforcement (Hoffman et al. 2015). The mill is required to report emissions to NPRI: conductthird-party stack testing, c ontinuous emission monitoring of total reduced sulfur (TRS), and ambient air monitor- ing for pollutants found in the Nova Scotia Air Quality Regulations pursuant to the Environment Act (NSE 2015). The mill' s air emission monitoring data are reviewed by provincial and federal regulators to ensurecompliance with applicable environmental permits and air quality objectives (ECCC 2014). Hoffman et al. (2015) provided detailed information on new and existing environmental policies that impose pollutionabatement in the P&P industry in Canada, particularly the PC mill (e.g., 2015 Industrial Approval). These are critical research gaps both in relation to community exposures to VOCs in P&P communitiesand in regard to adverse health effects resulting fromchronic exposure to P&P emissions which are a concerngiven the potential adverse health outcomes that VOCsand other P&P air emissions pose. This further justifies the need for more research to characterize air quality in this particular subset of industrial communities, whichhave often been neglected because of their remote locations. An intensive study of specific ambient air toxic emis- sions in PC has not been undertaken. The aim of this pilot study was to assess levels of PC community ex-posures to VOC air toxics emissions from 2006 to 2013, and to evaluate these data in relation to potential risks suggested by EPA air toxic guidelines. The mainobjective of this study was to determine whether wind direction correlated with p rioritized air toxic ambient VOC concentrations at a nearby NAPS site (Granton). As the Granton NAPS site is positioned southwest of the mill, it was hypothesized that prevailing winds (PW) from northerly and northeas terly directions would Fig. 1 Summer (2006 -2013) wind rose simulation using WRPlot View(blowing to direction) with the mill as the focal point ( 1), relative to communities (e.g., Pictou and Pictou Landing First Nation [PLFN]), NAPS discrete receptor sites, and other local point sourceemitters (e.g., tire manufacturing facility ( 2), coal-fired thermal electrical generating station ( 3)).

Materials and methods Spatial and temporal sampling Historical meteorological and NAPS data from the Granton NAPS site discrete receptor (ID: (i.e., speed and directionto the nearest 10\u00b0) were obtained from the closest EC meteorological station, Caribou Point (45.767\u00b0 N; 62.683\u00b0W), located ~10 km north of the mill (45.652\u00b0 N; 62.718\u00b0 W). Temporal data for ambient VOCs monitored at the Granton NAPS station were limited to 2006 to 2013. Nova Scotia Environment (NSE) operates both NAPS monitoring stations in PC: (i) downtown Pictou (ID:30901) located 3.5 km northeast of the mill and (ii)Granton (ID: 31201) located 2.5 km southwest of the mill (Fig. 1). The Pictou NAPS site routinely monitors NO, NO 2,N O x,O 3,P M 2.5, TRS (not VOCs), and wind characteristics, whereas th e Granton site monitors 36 VOC species. Multi-component VOC monitoring at NAPS sites are conducted using canister sampling andgas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) (CCME 2011). Sampling of 24 h (midnight to midnight) cumulative ambient air samples ( g/m 3)a r et a k e no na 1-in-6-day schedule by pumping ambient air into pres-surized stainless steel SUMMA\u00ae canisters and analyzed by an EC accredited Laboratory (CCME 2011; Galarneau et al. 2016). Statistical analyses Variation of meteorological conditions and VOC con- centrations were assessed by conducting a spatiotempo-ral analysis to characterize ambient air toxics emissions in PC from 2006 to 2013. Various analytical methods can be applied to concentration data to estimate sourceapportionments of air pollutants to provide additional insights into the source/receptor relationships to guide development of more effective air quality management strategies (Hopke 2016). However, given the limitations of having complete VOC data from only one NAPS monitoring station in the region, a full chemical mass balance analysis to identify and apportion sources of atmospheric contaminants were not conducted in thisstudy. Wind rose plots were generated with WRPlot View (\u00a9Lakes Environmental Software) to simulate seasonal andspatial variation of wind direction (\u00b0) frequency and wind speed (m/s) with the mill as the focal point. Although simpli- fied, wind rose models have proven utility for estimating spa-tial gradients for fate and transport of pollutants from emission sources (Gibson et al. 2013 ). Summer, when local people spend more time outdoors (and more vulnerable to outdoor pollution exposure), was a focus of this study (Figs. 1and2). This pilot study was conducted to determine whether ambient concentrations of VOCs exceeded their EPA-associated cancer and/or noncancer risk thresholds, to help identify potential human health concerns in PC. VOCs selected for analysis were based on EPA 'sl i s t of 30 urban air toxics (EPA 2015b)a n d National Air Toxics Trends Station Work Plan Template (EPA 2015d ). Health Canada and the province of Nova Scotia current-ly do not have specific guidelines for air toxics expo- sures. Therefore, EPA thresholds were considered a more acceptable standard for carcinogenic exposures inthis study. Cancer risk threshold refers to the probability of contracting cancer if exposed to a substance every day over the course of a lifetime (assumed to be70 years for the purposes of NATA risk characteriza- tion). Lower threshold values correspond with higher toxicity. Noncancer risk threshold is associated with ef- fects other than cancer, based on reference concentra- tions via the Bhazard quotient ^ratio (HQ; exposure di- vided by appropriate chronic or acute value) (EPA 2015c ). The HQ should not be interpreted as a proba- bility of adverse effects. Noncancer risk thresholds are typically higher compared to cancer risk thresholds, as lower concentrations can elicit a carcinogenic response, whereas other diseases are not triggered until higherexposure thresholds are reached. US and Canadian method detection limits (MDL) are provided (Health Canada 2010 ;E P A 2015d )( T a b l e 1). The mill is located approximately 40\u00b0 northeast of the Granton NAPS site. The selected PW range expect-ed to result in increased VOC concentrations at theNAPS site (\u00b140\u00b0 either side of the mill [80\u00b0 total]). A narrower range may be more accurate; however, due to the sample size of VOC samples, the selected rangecaptured more data. All other wind directions (AOWD) represent ranges outside PW (i.e., >80\u00b0, <360\u00b0). AOWD represent sampling days when no time PW blew from the selected range (i.e., 0 h). VOC concentrations for AOWD were compared to when PW were present for at least 1 h. Hourly meteorological data were compiled to corre- spond with ambient VOC sampling. Hourly wind direc-tion within defined PW range (i.e., 360\u00b0 -80\u00b0) was assigned a value of 1; AOWD were assigned a value of 0. Daily totals represented the proportion of time with PW (i.e., 1 -24 h) compared to AOWD. Daily20688 Environ Sci Pollut Res (2017) 24:20685 -20698totals corresponding to VOC sampling were VOC concentrations, which were predicted to correlate with higher VOC con-centrations. To test the effect of wind direction and season on ambient VOC concentrations, multivariateanalysis of variance (MANOVA) and univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA) were applied in \u00a9R. Due to right-skewed distributions for all VOCs, except for car-bon tetrachloride, statistical procedures were performed on both raw and log-transformation of VOC concentra- tions (Supplementary material Table S1). Box plots and histograms were used to compare VOC con- centrations with PW 1 h to AOWD on an annual and sea- sonal basis in relation to their respective cancer and noncancerrisk thresholds. See Supplementary material for histograms, and additional box-and-whisker plots illustrating VOCconcentrations , 8h ,12 h) (Figs. S2andS4). Box plots display the distribution of data based on a five- number summary: minimum, first quartile, median, third quar- tile, and maximum. The central rectangle ( Bbox^) spans the first to the third quartile (i.e., interquartile range [IQR]). The horizontal line segment within the box represents the median, and Bwhiskers ^above and below the box represent the mini- mum and maximum. Radar plots consist of a sequence of angular spokes, whose length extending from the center along a separate axis is proportional to the magnitude of the variable relative to the magnitude of the variable across all data points.Lines connect the data values for each spoke. Radar plots were used to display seasonal variation of median VOC concentra- tions for PW 1ha n dA O W D .O n e - t a i l e d ttests, assuming unequal variance, were performed to determine whether sea- sonal variation associated with increasing proportions of time Fig. 2 Seasonal (2006 -2013) wind rose simulations using WRPlot View (blowing to direction).

Quality control Standard procedures of the Meteorological Service of Canada have been developed in accordance with inter- nationally recommended procedures established by the World Meteorological Organization (ECCC 2013a). As part of the quality assurance and quality control (QA/ QC) program, observational meteorological data are sub- jected to a computer analysis or review to reveal possi-ble errors. EC and the operating agency are jointly re- sponsible for the NAPS network QA/QC program. Elements of the program include site selection, samplingsystem requirements, instrument calibration and refer- ence standard requirements, a nd inter-laboratory testing and performance audits. With few exceptions, analyzers are accorded with EPA designation as either a reference or equivalent method for ambient air monitoring (ECCC 2004). ECCC 's air quality laboratories use International Organization for Standardization requirements (i.e., ISO9001:2008 or ISO/IEC 17025:2005) (ECCC 2013b). Results and discussion Meteorological observations Wind rose simulations illustrate seasonal variability with respect to wind direction, with the mill as the focal point (Fig. 2). During summer, wind blew NNE(25.47%) and ENE (11.80%) directions (aggregate range15\u00b0-75\u00b0) towards Pictou and Pictou Landing First Nation (PLFN) (Figs. 1and 2). Wind blew less fre- quently towards S-NNW (aggregate range 165\u00b0 -345\u00b0) towards the Graton NAPS site. During winter, wind typically prevailed from the north; the highest frequency (21.99%) blowing ESE, followed by E (15.37%) direc-tions (aggregate range 75\u00b0 -135\u00b0) (Fig. 1). Spring and fall have meteorological characteristics that are similarto summer and winter and were considered transitionalperiods. Pictou, PLFN, Chance Harbour, Trenton and New Glasgow are communities close to the mill that are downwind of annual PW (range 15\u00b0 -165\u00b0). The Granton NAPS site correlates poorly with seasonal or annual wind directions (Fig. 2). VOC concentrations Carbon tetrachloride had the highest median concentration (0.5452 g/m 3) and vinyl chloride had the lowest (0.0014 g/m3)( F i g . 3). Carbon tetrachloride concentrations exceeded its EPA cancer risk threshold (0.1700 g/m3) for all samples, with maximum and minimum concentrations of 0.7047 and 0.2892 g/m3, respectively. Benzene concentra- tions exceeded its cancer risk threshold (0.1300 g/m3)f o r most samples, with maximum and minimum concentrationsof 1.889 and 0.0266 g/m 3, respectively. Concentrations of 1,3-butadiene concentrations occasionally exceeded its cancerrisk threshold (0.0300 g/m 3), with maximum and minimum concentrations of 0.1062 and 0 g/m3,r e s p e c t i v e l y( F i g .3 ). Consequently, 1,3-butadiene, benzene, and carbon tetrachlo-ride were air toxics of primary concern in terms of localTable 1 List of priority air toxics (i.e., VOCs), associated cancer/noncancer risk thresholds ( g/m3), P A 2015d risk threshold: the probability of contracting cancer over the course of a lifetime (assumed to be 70 years for the purposes of NATA risk characterization).

NATA and Health Canada 's MDLs are listed for comparison (Health Canada 2010;E are presented in Supplementary material (Fig. S5). ANOV A and MANOV A results revealed that 1,3-butadi- ene was significantly higher with the presence of PW 1h (p= 0.001and p= 0.01 for raw and log-transformed data, respectively). Tetrachloroethylene was also statistically higher with the presence of PW 1h(p< 0.01) for log-transformed data. Benzene approached significance with the presence ofPW1h( p= 0.07) for log-transformed data. Although not statistically significant, median concentrations of other VOCs,except carbon tetrachloride, were equal or marginally higher with presence of PW 1 h compared to AOWD. Season had a consistent significant effect on VOC concentrations, except chloroform and tetrachloroethylene (Supplementary material Fig.S2and Table S1). Box plots combined with radar graphs illustrate seasonal variation of VOC concentrations of primary concern (i.e., 1,3-butadiene, benzene, carbon tetrachloride) under PW 1 h and AOWD conditions (Figs. 4,5,a n d6 ). Median VOC concen- trations associated with PW 1 h and AOWD display parallel Fig. 4 Seasonal variation (2006 -2013) of [1,3-butadiene] ( g/m3) comparing AOWD to PW for at least 1 h on sampling days (i.e., 360\u00b0 80\u00b0), relative to associated cancer and noncancer risk thresholds.Minimum concentration is 0 g/m3or undetectable.

Minimum concentration for 1,3-butadiene and vinyl of 1,3-butadiene (Fig. 4)a n d benzene (Fig. 5) exhibit seasonal variation. Both have evi- dently higher concentrations during winter, with summer hav- ing overall lowest concentrations. In addition to exceeding cancer risk thresholds, ttest results revealed that 1,3-butadiene and benzene concentrations were significantly higher with the presence of PW 1 h compared to AOWD during at least two seasons, including spring and fall. Conversely, median carbontetrachloride concentrations showed little variation (Fig. 6). Regardless of season or wind direction, all carbon tetrachlo- ride samples exceeded its associated cancer risk. This pilot study presents findings of a secondary analysis of 8 years of air toxic VOC exposure data associated with ambi-ent air quality in a Canadian P&P town. Concentrations of three ambient outdoor air toxics routinely exceeded EPA airtoxics-associated cancer risk thresholds and are consequently of primary health concern in relation to population health risk in PC: 1,3-butadiene, benzene , and carbon tetrachloride. Exceedance in cancer risk thresholds for these air toxics is consistent in the literature (e.g., Morello-Frosch et al. 2000). The extent to which threshold exceedances of 1,3-butadiene adversely affect human health is poorly understood, with little toxicity information available to compare with cancer risk estimates (Morello-Frosch et al. 2000). With respect to ben- zene exposure, most monitoring data are associated with oc-cupational studies (ATSDR 2007a ), where long-term expo- sure can leukemia (ATSDR 2007b ). High exposure to carbon tetrachloride can cause liver, kidney, and centralnervous system damage (ATSDR 2005 ). Combinations of air toxics may have additive or synergistic adverse health ef-fects (Morello-Frosch et al. 2000 ). Therefore, exposure to mixed VOCs might pose health risks to facility employees and neighboring residents (An et al. 2014;H ee ta l .2015 ). Emission sources within the defined PW range, N to ENE of the Granton NAPS site, may be a causal factorfor the increase in VOC concentrations, except carbon tetrachloride. The largest point source emitter within thisrange is likely the mill; however, the origin(s) of VOCs are inconclusive. According to the mill' s most recent substance report submitted to NPRI in 2012, 143.18 t of VOCs were atmospherically emitted on-site (ECCC 2012). An estimated 3.195 t of benzene were released to the air from a stack higher than 50 m and 0.022 twere released within 50 m of the ground. Additionally, benzo(a)anthracene and of benzo(a)phenanthrene were emitted to the air (9.7 and 6.7 kg, respectively) anddeposited on-site (0.753 and 0.142 kg, respectively) (ECCC 2012). Although trichloroethylene, tetrachloro- ethylene, and carbon tetrachloride were not reported to have been released, they may become airborne through evaporation from P&P wastewater (Soskolne and Sieswerda 2010 ). Boat Harbour (the mill 's effluent treat- ment facility) may therefor e contribute to ambient con- centrations of VOCs. Collect ively, these emissions may have contributed to the ambient atmospheric levels of VOCs measured at the Granton NAPS site. While Fig. 5 Seasonal variation (2006 -2013) of [benzene] ( g/m3) comparing AOWD to PW for at least 1 h on sampling days (i.e., 360\u00b0 80\u00b0), relative to associated cancer and noncancer risk thresholds. Significant differences indicated ormation on pollutant re- leases, data are self-reported by facilities, with no audits to ensure accuracy. Consequently, data quality may becompromised. The major chlorinated hydrocarbon emitted into the air from bleached kraft pulp mills of concern is chloroform,which is produced by heating a mixture of chlorine and either chloromethane or methane (EPA 1985). Although chloroform is a recognized by-product of the chlorination process in the P&P industry, it has been suggested that up to 90% of total emission sources may be natural in origin and is widely dis- persed in marine environments (McCulloch 2003). As PC is located along the coast of the Northumberland Strait, marine environments may have contributed to the observed ambient chloroform concentrations (see Supplementary material ). Results implicate the mill as a source of air toxics (partic- ularly 1,3-butatdiene and tetrachloroethylene); however, otherlocal sources likely contribute to air toxics emissions. Area and mobile sources have been reported to largely contribute to concentrations of site is lo- cated near a highway and access roads, vehicle emissions mayhave contributed to the observed concentrations of these com-pounds. A coal-fired thermal generating station and a tire manufacturing facility (located 7 km E and 1.5 km S from the Granton NAPS site, respectively) may be other local pointsource emitters of VOCs (e.g., 1,3-butadiene is used to make synthetic rubber [ATSDR 2014b ]) (Fig. 1). According to the latest NPRI substance reports: the tire manufacturing facility released 220 t of atmospheric VOCs, whereas no VOC re- leases were reported by the t hermal generating station (ECCC 2015b ), despite that coal combustion is a significant contributor (Chagger et al. 1999). Direct links between 1,3- butdiene and vinyl chloride with P&P industries were not found in the literature. Major monitored pollutants at the mill include NO x, sulfur dioxide (SO 2), and total PM ([TPM] upper size limit of 100 m diameter) (NP 2016a). A 2013 study concluded that PM 2.5concentrations were highest (0.88 g/m3) downwind from the mill from using an AERMOD atmospheric dispersion model (Gibson et al. 2013), though this investigation used Halifax wind speed and direction meteorological data (130 km tothe south). Hoffman et al. (2015)r e p o r t e da na n a l y s i s of 2013 data showing that when Pictou is downwind of the mill, average 1 h ambient PM 2.5concentrations re- sult in a twofold increase (12.96 g/m3), compared to all other wind directions (5.73 g/m3), suggesting the mill is likely the primary contributor of ambient PM 2.5 in the community. Additionally, TRS, TPM, PM 2.5,a n d coarse particulate matter 10m( P M 10) emission exceedances at the mill during 2012 were two to three Fig. 6 Seasonal variation (2006 -2013) of [carbon tetrachloride] ( g/m3) comparing AOWD to PW for at least 1 h on sampling days (i.e., 360\u00b0 80\u00b0), relative to associated cancer and Pollut Res (2017) 24:20685 -20698 20693orders magnitude higher than five similar Canadian kraft P&P mills; however, VOC emissions were compa- rable (Hoffman et al. 2015). A comparable ambient air toxics monitoring study of a P&P community was conducted in the metropolitanLewiston, Idaho area and the Nez Perce Reservation (STI2009). Findings revealed that concentrations of formaldehyde a n da c e t a l d e h y d ew e r em u c hh i g h e rt h a ne x p e c t e dr e l a t i v et oLewiston 's size. Chloroform, tetrachloroethylene, and trichlo- roethylene were highest at monitoring sites nearest the mill, which presumably contributed at least 50% to pollutant con- centrations (STI 2009). However, due to insufficient informa- tion on local concentrations of anthropogenic and biogenic VOCs, it was inconclusive whether the mill was a causal factor. Recent (2009- 2013) measurements of ambient CEPA- toxic or equivalent agents monitored at NAPS sites re-vealed that 11 air toxics, including benzene, chloroform,trichloroethylene, and tetrachloroethylene exceeded am- bient air quality guidelines set by respective Canadian jurisdictions (Galarneau et al. 2016). An additional 16 air toxics approached guidelines. Although these guide- lines are not necessarily enforceable, CEPA outlines provisions for toxic compounds and are thus subject to risk management actions. Air toxics 'contribution to poor health on a regional and national scale has not been thoroughly investigated; therefore, calls into ques- tion the effectiveness of current toxic substance manage- ment in Canada. Nova Scotia is known as the Btail pipe of North America,^ due to being within the trajectory of long- range transport of emissions from transboundary sourcesalong the Eastern Seaboard, plus central and eastern Canada (NSE 2014). Background levels of air pollution that originate from resuspension and natural sources has been found to be major contributors to concentrations of carbon tetrachloride and benzene (Morello-Frosch et al. 2000). Background levels, in combination to carbon tet-rachloride 's capacity to persist in the atmosphere for a least a year, may explain why observed concentrationsare consistently above its associated cancer risk thresh-old at the Granton NAPS site, regardless of wind direction. Atmosphere circulation plays a complex role in dis- persion, transformation, and removal of pollutants. Thedispersion of pollutants from source emitters (e.g., smokestacks) is affected by crosswind mixing in bothhorizontal and vertical directions. Meteorological vari- ables, including wind speed, wind direction, tempera- ture, humidity, precipitation (process of removal), andatmospheric pressure are the main drivers of variation in pollutant concentrations and dispersion (Bates and Caton 2002 ). Furthermore, gravitational settling isimportant for pollutants with larger molecular weights (Oliver 2008); heavier particles settle or deposit closer to emission sources (Walker et al. 2003a, 2003b ). Gravitational settling may also explain the high concen-trations of carbon tetrachloride. Topography and coastal conditions can affect wind charac- teristics (e.g., direction, speed) and the behavior of pollutanttransport. A sea breeze that is trapped under descending warmer air from land can exaggerate conditions at coastalzones, a phenomenon known as coastal inversion (Bates and Caton 2002). In addition, turbulent winds along the coast may influence wind characteristics at the Caribou Point meteoro- logical station, and the fate and transport of pollutants. Such coastal conditions, in combination with transboundary air pol- lution, may be occurrences that coastal areas experience inNova Scotia, including PC. Seasonal variabilitySeasonal variability exists for both meteorological conditions and VOC concentrations. Variations in meteorological condi-tions, the nature and intens ity of emissions from nearby sources, and photochemical activity are factors that couldhave led to the observed seasonal variability of outdoorVOC levels (Al-Khulaifi et al. 2014 ). Of the three VOCs considered particular concern in this study, 1,3-butdaieneand benzene exhibited the highest concentrations during win-ter. Photochemical reactions involved with ground-level O 3 formation are catalyzed by ultraviolet radiation and tempera-ture. Therefore, peak ground-level O 3levels typically occur during warm days with sufficient sunlight exposure; thus, people are more vulnerable to exposure during summer. The opposite is true during winter, when available light is dimin- ished, and temperatures are colder (ATSDR 2014b ). Demographic behavior and technological improve- ments that aim to mitigate emissions (e.g., smokestackprecipitator installation in 2015) also need to be consid- ered when evaluating pollutant concentrations. For in-stance, households in the Atlantic provinces are heated primarily with oil, electrici ty, and wood or wood pellets (Statistics Canada 2011); therefore, as residential heating increases during winter, biogenic VOCs (e.g., benzene[ATSDR 2007a ], 1,3-butadiene [ATSDR 2014b]) burning may have contributed to higher concen- trations of these compounds observed in this study. As the mill operates on a 24/7 schedule (ECCC 2012 ), atmospheric VOC emissions were assumed consistent throughout the year. ImplicationsLocation of ambient air quality monitoring stations has a di- rect impact on the observed concentrations of pollutants20694 Environ Sci Pollut Res (2017) 24:20685 -20698(Craig et al. 2008). Based on the time series and spatial anal- yses, wind direction appears to play a key role in the Granton NAPS site 's ability to monitor ambient VOCs from the mill. PW1 h from the selected range (360\u00b0 -80\u00b0) typically result- ed in equal or higher VOC concentrations for all compounds,except carbon tetrachloride, compared to AOWD (Figs. 4,5, and6;Supplementary material ), suggesting that the mill is likely a causal factor. Furthermore, as there is a higher fre-quency of northerly winds blowing towards the south duringwinter (Fig. 2), the Granton NAPS site is more likely to cap- ture ambient pollutants from the mill 's atmospheric emissions. Southwest PW blowing towards Pictou dominate during thesummer months when people are more vulnerable to ambient air pollution exposure. Due to Pictou 's geography, air toxics from the Eastern Seaboard in combination with local emission sources, including the mill, converge there; hence, higher con- centrations of VOCs are expected in Pictou during summer. Subsequently, southwest PW are expected to result in lowerVOC concentrations at the Granton NAPS site, as capturing the mill 's atmospheric emissions would not be optimized. Therefore, VOC concentrations at the Granton NAPS site during winter would likely be representative of ambient VOC concentrations in Pictou during summer. Moreover, Pictou 's considerably larger population base compared to the rural area of Granton further confirms that the NAPS site is notstrategically positioned to accurately represent ambient levelsof air toxics where there is higher residential exposure. Study limitations This study only evaluated exposure to ambient VOC air pol- lutants. Human exposure to air pollution is a combination of both outdoor and indoor environments and varies according to daily activity patterns and the conditions of specific settings. Secondary data analysis was used in this study; therefore, theecological nature of these findings limit the explicit attribution of ambient air toxic exposures to the risk potential for cancer for community residents. Personal exposure monitoring, moredetailed spatial analysis of ambient conditions, and source apportionment studies would be required to establish more explicitly the health risk associated with these exposures.The analysis was limited by the inability to examine the inter- action of local meteorological conditions. Meteorological data were retrieved from Caribou Point, located approximately10 km from the mill; consequently, coastal conditions may cause differences in meteorological measurements between sites. Future research and monitoring Afield component consisting of real-time measurements of ambient air toxics would improve the rigor and validly of the present study. Although labor intensive, air toxics samplescan be analyzed with a high degree of accuracy (Craig et al. 2008 ). Because monitoring sta tions are typically fixed, government-approved atmospheric dispersion modeling that considers landscape dynamics and seasonal meteorologicalvariability (e.g., \u00a9CALPUFF, \u00a9AERMOD) would more ac- curately estimate spatial patterns of air toxics dispersion, andhuman exposure at the population or individual level (EPA 2013). This would require numerous stations within the com- munity so would likely only be feasible for a specific research investigation. Further, installation of a new precipitator in 2015 has likely changed in ambient conditions. A follow-up assessment would provide a comparison to these findings todetermine if VOC levels have improved. Additional research includes applying a Conditional Probability Function to cal- culate the probability that an air pollution source is located within a particular wind direction sector to help determine direction of a source from a NAPS discrete receptor site, and conducting an analysis of the effect of mixing height on mea-sured VOC concentrations to fu rther investigate seasonal patterns. Investigation of health outcomes might involve longitudi- nal epidemiological research of human exposures to air toxics emissions in the ambient Pictou environment with appropriate consideration for latency of health outcomes, while control- ling for indoor and occupational sources and other contextual factors. Several recent Canadian nationwide cohort studiesthat may provide a foundation for such investigations have been described (e.g., Crouse et al. 2012). Acomprehensive risk assessment investigates uncertainties that have implications for risk estimates in the present study, including those surrounding toxicity information (Morello- Frosch et al. 2000). More research is required to determine what cancer and noncancer risks are from ambient air toxics exposure. Further, it is important to consider synergistic ef- fects of a full suite of ambient pollutants, and physical andchemical processes involved in fate and transport of these compounds. Comprehensive emission inventories are neces- sary to thoroughly address (i.e., characterize, model, and man-age) air quality issues (CEC 2009 ). Collectively, these re- search efforts aim to better inform air quality management,composed of federal (e.g., ECCC, Health Canada) and provin-cial (e.g., NSE, Nova Scotia Department of Health and Wellness) government and public health agencies, how best to proceed to ensure the health of residents in industrial com-munities is prioritized. Implications of the current findings warrant further investigation. Given the contribution emissions from local sources have to regional, national, and global airsheds, local mitigation ini-tiatives should be an integral part of air quality strategies. There is no common approach to assess health effects of amixture of pollutants, as they tend to be site specific; hence, an assortment of effective measures may be required. Case studies that provide evidence of effective of air qualityEnviron Sci Pollut Res (2017) 24:20685 -20698 20695management interventions and guidance documents for risk managers may help inform air quality management for stake- h o l d e r s( C r a i ge ta l . 2008). To address potential adverse health effects associated with degraded air quality, Healt h Canada, the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) and provincial partners mightwork collaboratively with local stakeholders to mitigate health risks and improve efficient industrial technology, while balancing economic, political, and social factors in develop-ment and implementation o f air quality management. Mitigating industrial emissions has beneficial outcomes forwellbeing (Clougherty 2010); environmental stewardship and governance fosters a more proactive and cleaner environ- ment, while building trusting relationships between industrial stakeholders (Pascal et al. 2013).BA comprehensive enforce- ment program with mandatory reporting of emissions, [ ...] and meaningful penalties for noncompliance ensures that emission standards are being met ^(Craig et al. 2008), and facility operators are held accountable. Data collected inter- nally by the mill is not readily available. To improve transpar- ency, siting rationale for air quality monitoring stations andaccompanying data should be provided as part of a commit- ment to corporate responsibility of the mill (Hoffman et al. 2015). To improve air quality conditions, stakeholders could increase the capacity for surveillance, assessment, andresponse to air quality. Furthermore, evaluation of a wide-suite of air toxics, including NATA compounds not measured by the NAPS network (particularly prior-itized air toxics) would contribute to ensuring that air quality in Canada is adequately studied. Therefore, ECCC and NSE should consider implementation of along-term monitoring program for priority air toxics that is comparable to the NATA network monitored by EPA to characterize air toxics exposure on local, regional,and national scales. Data will be useful to help mitigate emissions and achieve acceptable air quality standards that do not exceed cancer or noncancer risk thresholds. ECCC should also consider the feasibility of installing and maintaining additional strategically placedNAPS sites to improve air pollution evaluation in bothrural and urban areas, as well as in microenvironments (e.g., near point source emitters, high-traffic areas) (Craig et al. 2008 ). More effective communication of the results is required to increase transparency among stakeholders, including the public (Hoffman et al. 2015 ). Based on the population 's risk of exposure, it is strongly recommended that ambient air toxics moni- toring to be incorporated at the established NAPS sta- tion in Pictou to optimize capturing of said air toxics,and to best correlate pertinent results. Additionally, at- mospheric dispersion mode ling should use local meteo- rological data; therefore, me teorological data should alsobe collected concurrently at NAPS sites to help identifysource emitters. Measurement of individual VOC compounds is nec- essary to provide insight into their contribution to PM 2.5 and ground-level O 3formation. Data would be useful to help target large source emitters and aid regulatory en- forcement. Establishment of stringent and/or adapted air quality standards that encompass more air toxics (e.g., VOCs) fosters strong public support and political en- gagement to address air quality issues. Moreover, health impacts associated with background air pollution should be estimated. Air quality management programs are hu-man resource intensive; therefore, they must have clear and feasible short- and long-term objectives. These ini- tiatives gain predictive insights on atmospheric chemis-try, and engage and support relevant sectors in the de- velopment and implementation of policies to reduce health risks associated with air pollution exposure(Craig et al. 2008). Conclusions Findings reveal that 1,3-butadiene, benzene, and carbon tetra- chloride exceeded their respective cancer risk thresholds and are of primary health concern in terms of population risk. Results highlight associations with wind direction and the Granton NAPS site 's ambient VOC concentrations in relation to location of the pulp mill. Compared to AOWD, PW from the selected range (360\u00b0 -80\u00b0) typically resulted in higher VOC concentrations for all compounds, except carbon tetra- chloride, suggesting that the mill is likely a contributor to increased concentrations. In addition, there are clear seasonal variations of meteorological conditions and VOC concentra-tions. Southwest PW blowing towards Pictou dominate during summer months, when people spend more time outdoors, and consequently are exposed to higher concentrations. Due toPictou 's geography, air toxics from transboundary and local sources may converge in summer, resulting in higher VOCconcentrations. Findings suggest the Granton NAPS site isnot positioned to accurately represent ambient levels of toxic- ity in PC. Therefore, ECCC and NSE should consider incor- porating ambient air toxics (e.g., VOCs) monitoring at theestablished Pictou NAPS site where there is higher residential exposure. Future research will provide air quality management with a comprehensive characterization of air toxics to support in-formed public health decisions. Moreover, this pilot study may serve as a precursor to gaining awareness, so that gov-ernment agencies adopt more stringent air quality regulations and monitoring programs to ensure health of citizens is safeguarded and prioritized.20696 Environ Sci Pollut Res (2017) 24:20685 -20698References Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (2005) Toxicological profile for carbon tetrachloride.

The environmental impact on our fisheries and the potential for future effluentspills as has happened in the past is incongruous with the safety of the local population.Furthermore, Northern Pulp refuses to accept that a closed pipe system would be practicalciting that the effluent would be too harmful to their machinery. This is not true, but it doesmean that they would have to change the nature of their end product. Even so the new endproduct would still be marketable in an open market. The issue is that the company doesn\u00e2?Ttengage fully in an open market and is possibly participating in Base Erosion Profit ShiftingTransfer Pricing.

Although provincial governments have alegitimate interest in creating and keeping jobs for the residents of their province, it is counterproductive to spend government funds to support industries that damage the health of the localenvironment, population and other local industry. Environmental regulations should bedesigned to protect us from industrial pollution, not make it more profitable for companies tocarry out their operations and companies should have to spend their own money to meet thoseregulations. If they can't meet them and still make a profit, then their business plan is flawedand they should shut down. Governments are always talking about the impact of deficitspending on our children and future generations but the impact of the environmental deficit,destroying and polluting the environment faster than it can rehabilitate itself, will be far moreburdensome - no air fit to breath, water fit to drink or land fit to produce food fit to eat.

Just the difference in the water temperature, not to mention theamount of chemicals, discharging from the pipe,destroying the eco system of several speciesof fish, birds etc.The time line of the release of the effluent into the lagoons of the heavilypolluted Boat Harbour, gave it extra time to cool the water and settle some of the heavy toxins.This will no longer be the case as it will be piped within an 8-9 hour period directly into theNorthumberland Stright, removing the 30 day period it had to cool and settle. It will destroythe Northumberland Stright as we know it. 3 Continuing to use Boat Harbour extensionrequested by Northern Pulp People have lived with the posion in this area long enough.

The proposal is to dewater the sludgeprior to mixing it with bark and other wood waste for combustion in the mills power boiler.This is the same power boiler that is currently and repeatedly failing stack emissions tests.Problems with air quality from mill emissions have been documented for years. Lack ofappropriate monitoring and enforcement already puts area residents at risk. Now, NorthernPulp is considering adding sludge containing toxins to the combustion mix, increasing healthrisks from NP\u00e2?Ts air emissions. It is also important to note, the route of this effluent pipegoes through the source water supply for the town of Pictou and community of Caribou andsurrounding area. http://ec.gc.ca/inrp-npri/donnees-data/index.cfm\u00e2?\u00a6https://www.nrcm.org/projects/waters/cleaning-up-the-androscoggin-river/maines-dioxin-problem/?fbclid=IwAR3gT3KRRmPu8j22heOksunum4i6VAp0cD-tb6hqJTVOTTyrGeRh7YAtZc8https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/b61814_40a0f43682ee45d99af01fb432d910fd.pdf?fbclid=IwAR3a7QpiR253DqowGxu5DQK13vDIcJru0rFyGl1cYCrO4GsFjHKMp6aghz4 2.For the overall ECONOMY The proposed treatment system runs the risk of harming threelifelong Industries worth close to $4 Billion dollars to the Nova Scotia economy.

However, they are at risk with theproposed Effluent treatment process. As it stands right now, there are no CCME guidelinesestablished for Marine Environments for some of the different chemicals and compounds thatmake up the pulp mill effluent. Pulp and Paper Effluent Regulations PPER in Canada covertwo matters total suspended solids TSS and biochemical oxygen demand BOD. Even thoughtotal discharges of TSS and BOD in pulp and paper effluent decreased by approximately 90 and 97 respectively from 1970-2008, pulp mill effluents continue to have harmful impacts on fish, fish habitat and the environment. Information gathered through environmental effects monitoring EEM at all Canadian mills points to the disturbing conclusion that although mills are meeting regulations and passing the PPER toxicity test, 70 are having harmful effects onaquatic life and habitat, and 55 are having harmful effects on the larger environment.

If meeting regulationsis not enough to prevent harm, neither is passing toxicity tests. Only one toxicity test isrequired under Canadian pulp and paper regulations. The required LC-50 test is for acutelethality. For this test, an effluent is considered acutely lethal if the treated effluent at 100concentration kills more than 50 of the Rainbow Trout exposed to it during a 96-hour period.Long-term effects, including impacts on reproduction or growth, cumulative impacts on fishhabitat and the larger environment or accumulation of substances harmful for humanconsumption are not regulated under the PPER. Testing for environmental effects is requiredfor information purposes. Only two mills in Canada test for and report impacts of effluent onthe usability of fish resources by humans. Effluent from pulp and paper mills is regulated atthe federal level principally by the Pulp and Paper Effluent Regulations PPER, which formpart of the Fisheries Act. The standards that apply to pulp effluent today were adopted in 1992and have remained unchanged for 25 years. Highly toxic dioxins and furans are regulatedunder a separate Act. 70 of pulp paper mills are having harmful effects on aquatic life andhabitat despite meeting current regulations . Long term impacts on reproduction and growthare not regulated under PPER. Federal regulations cover only a few of the recognized harmfulsubstances in pulp mill effluent. For example, there are no federal regulations for AOXcompounds, a component of pulp effluent in mills that bleach with chlorine or a chlorinecompound. AOX compounds are recognized as extremely toxic. They are not easily brokendown by bacteria and thus bioaccumulate in the environment. Yet they are not included inPPER regulations.

In the present system, untreatedeffluent is piped from the mill to the north settling ponds at Boat Harbour, where it remains for12 hours for primary treatment. It then moves to an aerated stabilization basin where effluentis placed in contact with micro-organisms. The effluent remains there for 8 days for secondarytreatment. After 8 days, the effluent is discharged from the aeration basin at what is known asPoint C, and treatment is considered finished. At point C, samples are taken for testing todetermine whether the treated effluent meets regulations. POINT C is also a DEAD ZONE!!After point C, the effluent enters the 300-acre Boat Harbour lagoon, also known as BoatHarbour Basin. Boat Harbour Basin was initially used as a stand-alone effluent treatmentfacility. In 1972, settling ponds and an aerated stabilization basin were constructed to meetstricter regulations for pulp effluent treatment. Additional aeration and other upgrades wereadded from 1992-1996, as the federal government again adopted stricter regulations. Thelagoon at Boat Harbour has not been officially part of the effluent treatment system since1972. Official or not, treated effluent remains in the lagoon for an additional 20-30 days.Further aeration, settling, cooling, volatilization and breakdown of materials takes place during that time. This is referred to as \u00e2?opolishing\u00e2? or tertiary treatment. Natural springs and surface run off further dilute the effluent. According to Northern Pulp\u00e2?Ts figures, during thetime in Boat Harbour Basin, total suspended solids TSS and biochemical oxygen below theproposed water quality standard of 1.\u00e2? The Stantec Preliminary Receiving Waters Study,August 2017, illustrates the same lack of dispersion. Treated effluent has never flowed directlyinto the deeper waters of the Strait. From its discharge at the shoreline, after 20-30 days inBoat Harbour Basin, tides and currents further break down, dilute and settle contaminantsbefore they reach the deeper waters of the Strait. It is misleading to imply that effluent fromthe proposed new system pumped directly into the fishing grounds of the Strait within 24 hourthat contains almost 1000kg of solids will have the same impact as the effluent whichpresently enters the Strait at the shore edge, hugs the shore and recirculates in and out ofPictou Harbour. Further to this, the same proposal was rejected in 1994 for the sameconcerns!! https://thetyee.ca/Analysis/2019/02/07/Pollution-Nova-Scotia-Pulp-Mill-Sink-Trudeau/? fbclid=IwAR2_XplvKgfjWHCh2fTuzimxmeMsnWVTVVhE6agYFPiXSwR3VvkEXHB4GEA https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/b61814_ab61cca668f1432f890d2d0a7715a554.pdf?fbclid=IwAR27oqDYJfCCBWdlMyNExvUrYZ_rBS86Gw77cT35IlLtVdyzh05AYwwcB1c 5.Better return for your TAX DOLLARS Nova Scotians are on the hook for the Boat Harbourclean up which is expected to be close to half a billion dollars once remediated. They also paidfor the design process of the proposed effluent process at a cost of $6 Million dollars and willbe expected to cover the construction, installation, labour etc for the proposed pipe estimatedat $100 Million dollars. Further to that $127 Million dollars of NS Tax payers dollars havebeen given to the mill in the last several years. Meanwhile we have doctors over worked andleaving our province. We have ER closures and very long wait times for treatment and care.Our Education system is also at its max with constant cuts.

The mill is going topump toxic waste directly into an aquatic environment. These waters are an important resourcenot only for Nova Scotia but also for Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick. It beggarsbelief that the pumping of effluent nearby to water sources on land and into the ocean is evenbeing considered. If you allow this to happen you are not only going to harm fishing industriesand ocean life you are threatening the health of Nova Scotians who live and work in the area.The mill have been given huge sums of money in the past and have had 5 years to fix theproblem presumably relying on government to bail them out.

One thingI do know is that the answer is not shutting down the plant, throwing all of those people out ofwork and creating chaos in the NS Pulp industry. Those who would do that should be askedwhat they will do to support those unemployed workers and their families. All I see fromopponents to this project is their limits on what is permissible.

According to Northern Pulp\u00e2?Ts figures, during thetime in Boat Harbour Basin, total suspended solids TSS and biochemical oxygen below theproposed water quality standard of 1.\u00e2? The Stantec Preliminary Receiving Waters Study,August 2017, illustrates the same lack of dispersion. Treated effluent has never flowed directlyinto the deeper waters of the Strait. From its discharge at the shoreline, after 20-30 days inBoat Harbour Basin, tides and currents further break down, dilute and settle contaminantsbefore they reach the deeper waters of the Strait. It is misleading to imply that effluent fromthe proposed new system pumped directly into the fishing grounds of the Strait within 24 hourthat contains almost 1000kg of solids will have the same impact as the effluent whichpresently enters the Strait at the shore edge, hugs the shore and recirculates in and out ofPictou Harbour. Further to this, the same proposal was rejected in 1994 for the sameconcerns!! https://thetyee.ca/Analysis/2019/02/07/Pollution-Nova-Scotia-Pulp-Mill-Sink-Trudeau/? fbclid=IwAR2_XplvKgfjWHCh2fTuzimxmeMsnWVTVVhE6agYFPiXSwR3VvkEXHB4GEA https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/b61814_ab61cca668f1432f890d2d0a7715a554.pdf?fbclid=IwAR27oqDYJfCCBWdlMyNExvUrYZ_rBS86Gw77cT35IlLtVdyzh05AYwwcB1c 5.Better return for your TAX DOLLARS Nova Scotians are on the hook for the Boat Harbourclean up which is expected to be close to half a billion dollars once remediated.

I welcome any politicianto drink some. The natives lost their land and fish were killed off. We have seen this in newBrunswick, marmachi and Irving recently. It is not worth the risk. Economic- our provincewas so desperate to pay the costs of cleanup. It is not worth it and now municipalities haverights with the most recent SCC decision, we are wasting money because of bad negotiations.Although the idea of diluting the substance into a straight appears nice. It fails to recognize thedownstream effects fishing industry, tourism in shediac, seafood of the native people. Climatechange- this plant produces ghgs and toxic pollution. The people of pictou are not healthy. Weunderstand sea level rise is coming which will bring coastal erosion. This mill would beaffected because most of it is 5 meters above sea level and the whole area is a flood plane. Taxrevenue- this is a private company. They will file for bankruptcy protection and creditors willsteal the workers pensions. In addition decrease tax revenue. Ecology- we have clear cut ahuge chunk of nova Scotia, this mill encourages such actions which is degrading our naturalwealth. It is harming species at risk which is illegal. Those trees took thousands of years togrow and they are not receiving a true value. Once our natural wealth is gone, we havenothing. Economy continued- closing that mill will open a free market where small businessescan mill their own wood again. It is more sustainable that way. International commitments-this does not mix with the paris agreement or the IPCC. We need to restore our forests notdegrade them. Innovation and future- I would support destroying the mill and building anotherone in another location, but only for hemp based products. There is a business case for helpplastics. If the tax payer is on the line, we should be forward thinking. Interprovincialrelations- both nb and pei have expressed dissatisfaction towards these plans. Respect that weshare close proximity to other jurisdictions. Public outcry- lots of protests have taken placeand more to follow. This degrades confidence on democracy.

Do the right thing for the people and environment and deny NPs EA application.Attachment The Chronicle Herald Published: 3/26/1994 Day: TO PROTECT FISH HABITAT FROM EFFLUENT Reporter: BY BRIANUNDERHILL OTTAWA BUREAU AND THE CANADIAN PRESS Ottawa \u00e2?\" The NovaScotia government wont be allowed to pipe Boat Harbour effluent into the NorthumberlandStrait if it poses a threat to fish habitat, federal Fisheries Minister Brian Tobin said Friday.And the minister said a decision on the controversial proposal wont be made until theres a fullenvironmental assessment and fishermen are consulted. British Columbia Reform MP JohnCummins raised the issue during the daily question period, saying groups in the area arejustifiably apprehensive over proposals for a new facility to treat effluent from the ScottMaritime Ltd. pulp mill in Abercrombie Point. Plans are under way for a $17\u00e2?\"millionupgrade of the provincially operated Boat Harbour system, which treats about 87 million litresof waste from the nearby mill daily. The province wants to pipe effluent about two kilometresinto the Northumberland Strait. The province hopes to award construction contracts by Julyand complete construction by September 1995. The issue has generated heated debate inPictou County. Fishermen fear the proposal could damage spawning grounds and fish stocks,and theyve threatened to blockade the project. Mr. Cummins sought assurances the Liberalswill not allow damage to the fish habitat. He said shellfish harvests in some areas off the WestCoast had been curtailed because of poisoning from pulp mill effluents. Tobin said he had anobligation under the Fisheries Act to protect fish habitat. The easy decisions like not allowingpollutants that would be contrary to the Fisheries Act into critical spawning areas would beeasy for us to take. This government will not compromise conservation habitat for any reason.Mr. Tobin said a full assessment of the proposal has not been completed and no decision willbe made until that process is wrapped up.

From: @gmail.com To: Environment Assessment Web Account Subject: Proposed Project Date: February 8, 2019 1:13:19 PM Project: replacement_effluent_treatment_facility_project Comments: A few reasons for a Federal Environmental Assessment, based on the negative impact the proposed dischargelocation and associated effluent will have on the Northumberland Strait: 1. The obviousconflict of interest of having the Province as both the supplier of the new treatment facility andregulator of the same. 2. Northern Pulp\u00e2?Ts receiving water study is based on dated modelingof the Northumberland Strait. This modeling, to have any chance at accuracy, needs to bemade current. 3. The receiving water area is part of a Marine Protected Area a scallop bufferzone. 4. This is within a Federal fishing zone. 5. The Aboriginal rights of Pictou Landing FirstNations need to be considered. The new discharge location still has a direct affect on them andtheir livelihood, as it pertains to fishing. 6. The Northumberland Strait borders on PrinceEdward Island, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. There are fishers from all three provinces,including First Nations, that this proposed effluent, will impact. 7. There are \u00e2?~Species atRisk\u00e2?T that potentially will be negatively affected. 8. The proposed discharge location isdirectly adjacent to Caribou-Munroe\u00e2?Ts Island Park a bird and wildlife sanctuary. 9.Northern Pulp is undoubtedly going to take the Province of Nova Scotia to court, when BoatHarbour closes as per the \u00e2?~Boat Harbour Act\u00e2?T. Consequently, there is pressure on theProvince to expedite the environmental process, due to the Indemnity Agreement and leasearrangements between our Provincial government and Northern Pulp. 10. The proposed pathof the pipe in Caribou Harbour will destroy fish habitat, eelgrass beds, etc. Northern Pulps EAsuggests to avoid ice damage to the effluent pipe, a trench 9 meters wide by 3 meters deep for4.1 kilometers in length to the discharge point would be installed. This construction woulddirectly breach section 35.1 of the Federal Fisheries Act as it will kill fish and destroy fishhabitat. 11. The 62 to 90 million liters of hot, according to Northern Pulp, summer temperatureof effluent at the discharge point will be 38 degrees Celcius, treated effluent daily, containingapproximately 1000 kg of solids which technically are toxic waste, will negatively impact andkill lobster and herring larvae directly breaching section 36 of the Federal Fisheries Act.Please ensure a Federal Environmental Assessment is applied, to adequately address theseconcerns.

The province of NS ignores the precautionary principle at all costs, provingthey are incompetent or complicit, but they do not have jurisdiction in the NorthumberlandStrait to do so. 2.4 Precaution in science-based decision making The Federal Government hasdeveloped a document entitled A Framework for the Application of Precaution in Science-based Decision Making about Risk [Privy Council Office PCO, 2003]. This paper addressesthe application of precaution in its various forms - precaution, the Precautionary Principle orthe precautionary approach - all of which have three basic components: the need for a decisiona risk of serious or irreversible harm and a lack of full scientific certainty. As stated in thedocument, the application of precaution primarily affects the development of options and thedecision phases within science-based risk management, is clearly linked to scientific analysis,and cannot be applied without an appropriate assessment of scientific factors and consequentrisks. A key role of developing ecological and human health risk assessments is to provide thenecessary evaluation of science and potential risks to support the use of precaution in theultimate decision making process, at which point factors such as social and ethical values andpolitical and economic considerations will also be taken into account. The precautionaryprinciple is entrenched in CEPA 1999. In the preamble, CEPA 1999 recognizes that theGovernment of Canada is committed to implementing the precautionary principle. Wherethere are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall not beused as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation.In addition, section 76.1 of CEPA 1999 specifically directs the Ministers to apply a weight-of-evidence approach and the precautionary principle when conducting and interpreting theresults of assessments of existing substances. As described in greater detail in PCO 2003, thegeneral principles outlining the distinguishing features of precautionary decision making arethat: The application of precaution is a legitimate and distinctive decision-making approach,notably within risk management. It is legitimate that decisions be guided by societys chosenlevel of protection against risk. In risk management, sound scientific information and itsevaluation must be the basis for the decision to apply precaution and the measure selected inapplying precaution the scientific information base and responsibility for producing it mayshift as knowledge evolves. Mechanisms should exist for re-evaluating the basis for decisionand for providing a transparent process for further consideration, recognizing that in somecases re-evaluation may not be practical or productive. A high degree of transparency, clearaccountability and meaningful public involvement are appropriate. From: @ .ca To: Environment Assessment Web Account Subject: Proposed Project Comments Date: February 8, 2019 6:13:50 PM Project: replacement_effluent_treatment_facility_project Comments: This environmental assessment is to examine the efficacy of a proposed effluent treatment and evacuation systemproposed by Northern Pulp. A clear deadline for the use of Boat Harbour as a depuration siteby Northern Pulp was legislated and a commitment has been made to the community of PictouLanding First Nation that Boat Harbour will stop being used as a depuration site in January2020. Five years have gone by since the deadline was established. Northern Pulp says that theonly alternative to Boat Harbour is a straight pipe into the Northumberland Strait. They havehad to change the proposed site for the pipe at least once and have not been able to completethe marine surveys needed to evaluate the newly proposed site. This proposed site for the pipeis near a prime area for the lobster fishery. The waters in the Strait reach Prince Edward Islandand New Brunswick. The premiers of these provinces are opposed to this pipe being installedwithout a full fed eral environmental assessment. The design of the effluent treatment systemand the pipe to the Northumberland Strait has been subsidized by provincial funding. I believethat it is a conflict of interest for the province of Nova Scotia to carry out an environmentalassessment of a project that it has subsidized. A recent change in federal regulationsconcerning effluents from pulp mills has raised the bar for treatment plants. The new standardsare considerably more rigorous than those enacted into law in 1992. Will the proposed effluenttreatment and evacuation system meet those standards? Will the provincial environmentalassessment take the new federal standards into account? Or will a \u00e2?owork-around\u00e2?solution promising upgrades to meet the more recent standards be allowed? Northern Pulp\u00e2?Tswillingness to endanger the waters crucial for the lobster fishery of three provinces byreleasing an effluent of unproven quality is frightening. We are told that the best science isbeing used, but do these \u00e2?obest practices\u00e2? apply to a tidal salt marsh that serves as anursery for juvenile lobster? Scientists from government and university laboratories havevoiced their concerns about this treatment system. A massive public relations campaign byNorthern Pulp and the industrial forestry industry is trying to mobilize public opinion to acceptan extension of their use of Boat Harbour. The long-standing environmental racism embodiedby the poisoning of Boat Harbour cannot be continued. Given the strong conflict of interest theprovince of Nova Scotia has in this matter, given Nova Scotia\u00e2?Ts heavy financialinvolvement in the mill and its subsidizing of the plans for the effluent treatment system, giventhat the fishery in three provinces could be affected by the release of effluent into theNorthumberland Strait, given that the evaluation of the proposed release site is incomplete, Istrongly believe 1 that this project should be returned to Northern Pulp so that the crucialaspects concerning the proposed release site be validated by marine surveys, and 2 that theproposed effluent treatment system undergo a federal environmental impact assessment and beevaluated relative to the most recent federal standards.

From: To: Environment Assessment Web Account Subject: Northern Pulp Effluent Proposal Date: February 9, 2019 7:32:51 PM I am 100% opposed to the proposal by Northern Pulp to discharge its waste directly into the Northumberland Strait. There is no way this volume of warm, fresh, toxin filled water into a water body like the strait will not effect thedelicate ecosystem. This massive volume of waste water will not just disappear when pumped into the strait, this isnot the open ocean but a narrow strip of water with complex tides and incomplete flushing between two provinceswho rely heavily on the fisheries industry. Northern Pulp should have to prove that this plan will not harm themarine environment, it is hard to take their word for it when common sense and science suggest that even minorchanges in temperature and salinity will have a major impact on delicate lobster larvae. The proposal to dig up thatmuch of the bottom to bury the pipe will have the potential to destroy many fishing lands with the sediment alone.There is no way the toxins and solid waste won't build up on the ocean floor and destroy the fisheries and buildupon our beaches and destroy tourism and the health of many families along these cottage lined shores. Please, put theenvironment first and stop this insanity! There is already a higher rate of cancer in Pictou County, I can only assumethis will be worse when we are all swimming in these toxins without the settling time and filtering that boat harbourcurrently provides. At a minimum please let an unbiased federal assessment happen since this provincialgovernment has a conflict of interest being on the hook financially. Current environmental standards and minimumrequirements are outdated and being reviewed federally and I would hate to see our government push ahead withthis ludicrous proposal before there is time for new standards to be implemented which surely would not allow thislevel of pollution to happen.Sincerely,Concerned mother, and citizen of County, Sent from my iPhone From: To: Environment Assessment Web Account Subject: Environmental Assessment must not be passed.

I present his five reasons not to allow this industry to put a pipe into theNorthumberland Strait below. I will say that the owner of this company (which is also responsible for clearcutting and usingwhole trees for an industry, biomass, that was brought in on the basis that only scrap wood wouldbe used) is responsible for clearcutting the Borneo Rainforest--earth's lungs. This company must be regulated or, better still, removed from this province. Let the (wood) chips fall where they may regarding lost jobs, we need clean sustainable industry that doesn't contribute to destroyingour precious resources in the Northumberland Strait and in the Acadian Forests, not to mentionthe carbon-sequestering capacity that is being removed by clearcutting and the deterioration ofour air and waters. wrote recently five reasons not to pass the Provincial EA that would allow this effluent to be piped into the Northumberland Strait: \"1. For your healthThe composition of the toxic effluent will contain dioxins, furans, metals, solids and othercontaminants at a rate of 90,000,000 Litres per day. Dioxins and furans can cause very serious health issues to humans and our food sources. Shellfish absorb dioxins and furans at 25,000-50,000 times the concentration in the water. The Northern Pulp treatment system proposal includes a plan to burn the waste sludge. The waste sludge contains toxins which would be released through the stacks of the mill's powerboiler. The proposal is to \"dewater the sludge prior to mixing it with bark and other woodwaste for combustion in the mill's power boiler.\" This is the same power boiler that is currently and repeatedly failing stack emissions tests. Problems with air quality from mill emissions have been documented for years. Lack ofappropriate monitoring and enforcement already puts area residents at risk. Now, NorthernPulp is considering adding sludge containing toxins to the combustion mix, increasing healthrisks from NP's air emissions.Dioxins and Furans - Canada.ca Health Canada 2001 article (updated 2005) from Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada.

For the economy The proposed treatment system runs the risk of harming three lifelong Industries worth close to $4 billion to the Nova Scotia economy. The tourism industry is worth $2.7 billion andprides itself on warm, clean water and world-class sandy beaches. The commercial fisheriesare worth over $1 billion and relies on sustainable wild shellfish that is shipped all across theworld. The sport fishing industry is worth $56 million, and the Northumberland Strait is hometo the last remaining stable Atlantic Salmon stocks on mainland Nova Scotia. See also: Nova Scotia exports top 10 ; Nova Scotia celebrates seafood export success at fisheries conference 3. For the environment - Meeting regulations does not prevent harm Nova Scotia and the Northumberland Strait are put at risk by the proposed effluent treatment process. As it stands right now, there are no CCME guidelines established for marine environments in terms of some of the chemicals and compounds that make up the pulp milleffluent. Pulp and Paper Effluent Regulations (PPER) in Canada cover two matters; total suspended solids (TSS) and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD.) Even though total discharges of TSSand BOD in pulp and paper effluent decreased by approximately 90% and 97% respectivelyfrom 1970-2008, pulp mill effluents continue to have harmful impacts on fish, fish habitat andthe environment. Information gathered through environmental effects monitoring (EEM) at all Canadian millsNova Scotia Celebrates Seafood Export Success at Fisheries Conference News releases from the Government of Nova Scotia CCMEpoints to the disturbing conclusion that although mills are meeting regulations and passing the PPER toxicity test, 70% are having harmful effects on aquatic life and habitat, and 55% are having harmful effects on the larger environment. This information led the federal department of Environment and Climate Change to undertakea modernization review of pulp and paper effluent regulations in 2017. \"Results from EEMstudies and the changing realities of the pulp and paper industry indicate a need to modernizethe PPER to improve environmental protection,\" the department states. If meeting regulations is not enough to prevent harm, neither is passing toxicity tests. Onlyone toxicity test is required under Canadian pulp and paper regulations. The required LC-50test is for acute lethality. For this test, an effluent is considered acutely lethal if the treatedeffluent at 100% concentration kills more than 50% of the Rainbow Trout exposed to it duringa 96-hour period. Long-term effects, including impacts on reproduction or growth, cumulativeimpacts on fish habitat and the larger environment or accumulation of substances harmful forhuman consumption are not regulated under the PPER. Testing for environmental effects isrequired for information purposes. Only two mills in Canada test for and report the impacts of effluent on the usability of fishresources by humans. Effluent from pulp and paper mills is regulated at the federal levelprincipally by the Pulp and Paper Effluent Regulations (PPER), which form part of theFisheries Act. The standards that apply to pulp effluent today were adopted in 1992 and haveremained unchanged for 25 years. Highly toxic dioxins and furans are regulated under aseparate Act. 70% of pulp & paper mills are having harmful effects on aquatic life and habitat despitemeeting current regulations. Long term impacts on reproduction and growth are not regulatedunder PPER. Federal regulations cover only a few of the recognized harmful substances in pulp mill effluent. For example, there are no federal regulations for AOX compounds, a component of pulp effluent in mills that bleach with chlorine or a chlorine compound. AOXcompounds are recognized as extremely toxic. They are not easily broken down by bacteriaand thus bioaccumulate in the environment. Yet they are not included in PPER regulations.Neither are phenols, toluene, chloroform or chemical oxygen demand (COD). For 25 yrs the regulations that apply to pulp effluent have remained unchanged. Provinces may go beyond Federal standards and adopt stricter regulations for effluent from pulp mills.British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario and Quebec have adopted stricter regulations. Nova Scotia does not have regulations but sets limits through individual industrial approvals. The EU hasmore protective regulations than Canada does. See also: Preliminary Receiving Water Study for Northern Pulp Effluent Treatment Plant Replacement, Pictou Harbour, Nova Scotia Stantec_Receiving Water Study_Effluent Treatment Plant Replacement.pdf4. The new treatment facility is not better than the current one Northern Pulp's proposed new effluent treatment facility differs from the present facility in a number of ways. In the present system, untreated effluent is piped from the mill to the northsettling ponds at Boat Harbour, where it remains for 12 hours for primary treatment. It thenmoves to an aerated stabilization basin where effluent is placed in contact withmicroorganisms. The effluent remains there for 8 days for secondary treatment. After 8 days,the effluent is discharged from the aeration basin at what is known as Point C, and treatment isconsidered finished. At point C, samples are taken for testing to determine whether the treated effluent meets regulations. Point C is also a dead zone! After point C, the effluent enters the 300-acre Boat Harbour lagoon, also known as BoatHarbour Basin. Boat Harbour Basin was initially used as a stand-alone effluent treatmentfacility. In 1972, settling ponds and an aerated stabilization basin were constructed to meetstricter regulations for pulp effluent treatment. Additional aeration and other upgrades wereadded from 1992-1996, as the federal government again adopted stricter regulations. Thelagoon at Boat Harbour has not been officially part of the effluent treatment system since1972. Official or not, treated effluent remains in the lagoon for an additional 20-30 days. Further aeration, settling, cooling, volatilization and breakdown of materials takes place during that time. This is referred to as \"polishing\" or tertiary treatment. Natural springs andsurface run off further dilute the effluent. According to Northern Pulp's figures, during thetime in Boat Harbour Basin, total suspended solids (TSS) and biochemical oxygen below theproposed water quality standard of 1%.\" The Stantec Preliminary Receiving Waters Study, August 2017, illustrates the same lack of dispersion. Treated effluent has never flowed directly into the deeper waters of the Strait.From its discharge at the shoreline, after 20-30 days in Boat Harbour Basin, tides and currentsfurther break down, dilute and settle contaminants before they reach the deeper waters of theStrait. It is misleading to imply that effluent from the proposed new system pumped directlyinto the fishing grounds of the Strait within 24 hour that contains almost 1000 kg of solids willhave the same impact as the effluent which presently enters the Strait at the shore edge, hugsthe shore and recirculates in and out of Pictou Harbour.

Basically, Northern Pulp wants toredirect the majority of the flow from the Middle River - between 62 and 90million liters per day, heat it up to 37 degrees Celsius, add 1 ton of what istechnically toxic waste solids, then direct that to the mouth of CaribouHarbour. This effluent will kill lobster larvae; it's inevitable and woulddirectly breach section 36 of the Federal Fisheries Act. The mill then states, 'it's unlikely there will be any harm to lobster', in their environmental assessment. It is virtually impossible that there will not be adverse effectsfrom this dramatic redirection of the Middle River, to the mouth of CaribouHarbour. For our Provincial government to have not immediately sent this to the Federal government for environmental assessment is outrageous. Tosuggest, 'this is not a new facility, just replacement of an existing one', as thereason for a provincial assessment, is not reasonable or realistic. Tocompletely redirect the flow of a major river to the mouth of CaribouHarbour, miles from where it's been flowing, into the very heart of the mostlucrative lobster and herring grounds in the Northumberland Strait, aprovincially shared Federal Fishing zone, this goes beyond responsible,honest government, with regards to the environmental assessment applied. Our government is in an obvious conflict of interest. The Supreme Court of Canada agrees, according to the ruling of Justice Timothy Gabriel last fall,with regards to Pictou Landing First Nations and the Provincial Government with respect to the government funding of a replacement facility and the relationship with Northern Pulp. Justice Gabriel stated, \"... it would essentially boil down to the Crown (wearing one hat) being called upon to determine whether a project which the Crown (wearing another hat) hasfunded passes muster. This will do nothing to assuage whatever cynicism hasbeen engendered in the past.\"I believe the working group of fishermen's organizations, together withPictou Landing First Nations, should be taking the Province and NorthernPulp to Supreme Court on this basis; in the event the Federal Governmentdoes not step in and take control of this environmental assessment. I believewe, as Fishermen and First Nations, have a legal right to protect our industry- and Justice Gabriel has set the precedent. We undoubtedly will lose our Marine Stewardship Certification, (a majormarketing tool), for both our herring and lobster fisheries as a result of thisnew effluent pipeline, as part of the criteria is the species are harvested froma healthy environment, in a sustainable fashion. It's already affecting theexisting fishery and not just here, in P.E.I as well. Fishermen are anticipatingthe value of their enterprises to be less than half what there are now, as soonas there is real indication of construction of this effluent pipe; and some haveliterally already sold out on this realistic assumption. In Northern Pulps submitted environmental assessment, the pipe would berequired to be set at a depth below the seabed of 3 meters due to potentialfrom ice damage. To accomplish this, they submit the trench would have tobe 9 meters across, for the entire length of 4.1 kilometers from where itenters the harbour adjacent to the ferry dock, to the mouth of the harbour,the proposed discharge location. The sediment alone from this constructionwould destroy the local fishery and directly breaches section 35 of theFederal Fisheries Act as it will destroy marine habitat, eelgrass beds, etc.,killing juvenile fish, lobster and crab. The sediment dispersed will causehavoc with the marine environment for miles and for how long, is anyone'sguess. There came a point, when the environment outweighs the economy, it's past.In this day and age, to even consider directing this massive flow of 'treated',poisonous effluent directly to the Northumberland Strait, is not reasonable orremotely with noble conscience from Northern Pulp. There is an alternative,yet the mill will not consider it, as it would mean less profits - converting themill to a mechanical process that separates the pulp, no effluent dischargerequired and less air emissions - this actual possibility could be discussed at length. The mill simply will not consider it, as it is less profitable and therewould be 'downtime' at their expense while converting. Our government is closing Boat Harbour in January 2020, ten years premature of the lease agreement, but actually 25 years late, from what was originally promised to Pictou Landing First Nations. To continue using Boat Harbour, is to continue with the current environmental racism that PLFN have been enduring for 52 years and are currently, on a daily basis,contending with. To ask for an extension, is simply ignorant. Because theclosure of Boat Harbour is premature of this lease agreement that theProvince agreed to without PLFN consent, Premier McNeil has been quotedsaying that the monies our government will be giving Northern Pulp are notto directly pay for the estimated 130 million dollar 15.5 km pipe and newtreatment facility, but in lieu of the lease agreements early closure....Obviously, this 130 million could be better spent on converting the mill to amechanical, closed loop system. The mill has no interest and has continuallystated, no pipe = no mill. If all you are thinking about is profits, you can't blame them. This company, Asia Pulp and Paper, subsidiary, PaperExcellence, buys up moth balled pulp mills for peanuts in comparison totodays cost, (that would be upwards of 2 billion dollars), spends next tonothing on upgrades, rakes in government subsidies and hand-outs... and inthe case of our mill, is not responsible for any environmental damage. What a deal! The mill with the worst environmental record in the Country, has noenvironmental consequence - a coincidence? Think about that, why wouldyou improve your discharges, (air and water), if there are no consequences?No you can't blame them for not wanting to convert the mill. There would be downtime and they couldn't sue our government for it - and they will besuing for any 'downtime' when Boat Harbour closes, you can count on that. They have a sweetest of deals right now and the fishing and forestryindustries are both paying for it! The thing is, our government, (the people), have allowed this to happen. The question is, will we continue to? This mill is not worried about our marine environment and really, other thanfrom a profits perspective, they are not worried about the longevity of ourforest industry either. I don't suspect anyone in the forest industry would want any harm to thefishing industry and I know the reverse is the same; we in the fishingindustry want the forest industry to thrive, but simply not at our expense. There is a solution and the extension of Boat Harbour is not the solution. The solution is to covert the mill; this is what the Forest industry should bepromoting to Northern Pulp.

My first instinct isthat this pipeline is a very bad idea because the document as presented doesnt really tell meanything. I think after all of the years of seeing what has happened at Boat Harbour, thepotential of disaster with the pipeline is very real. I certainly wouldnt like to see the pulp millclosed with great job loss but environmental protection must be first and foremost.

However, they are at risk with theproposed Effluent treatment process. As it stands right now, there are no CCME guidelinesestablished for Marine Environments for some of the different chemicals and compounds thatmake up the pulp mill effluent. Pulp and Paper Effluent Regulations PPER in Canada covertwo matters total suspended solids TSS and biochemical oxygen demand BOD. Even thoughtotal discharges of TSS and BOD in pulp and paper effluent decreased by approximately 90and 97 respectively from 1970-2008, pulp mill effluents continue to have harmful impacts onfish, fish habitat and the environment. Information gathered through environmental effectsmonitoring EEM at all Canadian mills points to the disturbing conclusion that although millsare meeting regulations and passing the PPER toxicity test, 70 are having harmful effects on aquatic life and habitat, and 55 are having harmful effects on the larger environment. This information led the federal department of Environment and Climate Change to undertake a modernization review of pulp and paper effluent regulations in 2017. \u00e2?oResults from EEM studies and the changing realities of the pulp and paper industry indicate a need to modernizethe PPER to improve environmental protection,\u00e2? the department states. If meeting regulationsis not enough to prevent harm, neither is passing toxicity tests. Only one toxicity test isrequired under Canadian pulp and paper regulations. The required LC-50 test is for acutelethality. For this test, an effluent is considered acutely lethal if the treated effluent at 100concentration kills more than 50 of the Rainbow Trout exposed to it during a 96-hour period.Long-term effects, including impacts on reproduction or growth, cumulative impacts on fishhabitat and the larger environment or accumulation of substances harmful for humanconsumption are not regulated under the PPER. Testing for environmental effects is requiredfor information purposes. Only two mills in Canada test for and report impacts of effluent onthe usability of fish resources by humans. Effluent from pulp and paper mills is regulated atthe federal level principally by the Pulp and Paper Effluent Regulations PPER, which formpart of the Fisheries Act. The standards that apply to pulp effluent today were adopted in 1992and have remained unchanged for 25 years. Highly toxic dioxins and furans are regulatedunder a separate Act. 70 of pulp paper mills are having harmful effects on aquatic life andhabitat despite meeting current regulations . Long term impacts on reproduction and growthare not regulated under PPER. Federal regulations cover only a few of the recognized harmfulsubstances in pulp mill effluent. For example, there are no federal regulations for AOXcompounds, a component of pulp effluent in mills that bleach with chlorine or a chlorinecompound. AOX compounds are recognized as extremely toxic. They are not easily brokendown by bacteria and thus bioaccumulate in the environment. Yet they are not included inPPER regulations. Neither are phenols, toluene, chloroform or chemical oxygen demand COD.For 25 yrs the regulations that apply to pulp effluent have remained unchanged. Provinces maygo beyond Federal standards and adopt stricter regulations for effluent from pulp mills. BritishColumbia, Alberta, Ontario and Quebec have adopted stricter regulations. Nova Scotia doesnot have regulations, but sets limits through individual industrial approvals. The EU has moreprotective regulations than Canada does.https://drive.google.com/file/d/1H1HltUnh9Oem_KpPHwxmye7z5mfJP5_W/view?fbclid=IwAR1WyzupTqjLC9u8tjxWpq94e5anlEQDs_-JTH0z8vPWAoaKkyIoGBuumdM 4.New treatment Facility is NOT BETTER Northern Pulp\u00e2?Ts proposed new effluent treatmentfacility differs from the present facility in a number of ways. In the present system, untreatedeffluent is piped from the mill to the north settling ponds at Boat Harbour, where it remains for12 hours for primary treatment. It then moves to an aerated stabilization basin where effluentis placed in contact with micro-organisms. The effluent remains there for 8 days for secondarytreatment. After 8 days, the effluent is discharged from the aeration basin at what is known asPoint C, and treatment is considered finished. At point C, samples are taken for testing todetermine whether the treated effluent meets regulations. POINT C is also a DEAD ZONE!!After point C, the effluent enters the 300-acre Boat Harbour lagoon, also known as BoatHarbour Basin. Boat Harbour Basin was initially used as a stand-alone effluent treatmentfacility. In 1972, settling ponds and an aerated stabilization basin were constructed to meetstricter regulations for pulp effluent treatment. Additional aeration and other upgrades wereadded from 1992-1996, as the federal government again adopted stricter regulations. Thelagoon at Boat Harbour has not been officially part of the effluent treatment system since1972. Official or not, treated effluent remains in the lagoon for an additional 20-30 days.Further aeration, settling, cooling, volatilization and breakdown of materials takes place duringthat time. This is referred to as \u00e2?opolishing\u00e2? or tertiary treatment. Natural springs andsurface run off further dilute the effluent. According to Northern Pulp\u00e2?Ts figures, during thetime in Boat Harbour Basin, total suspended solids TSS and biochemical oxygen below theproposed water quality standard of 1.\u00e2? The Stantec Preliminary Receiving Waters Study, August 2017, illustrates the same lack of dispersion. Treated effluent has never flowed directly into the deeper waters of the Strait. From its discharge at the shoreline, after 20-30 days inBoat Harbour Basin, tides and currents further break down, dilute and settle contaminantsbefore they reach the deeper waters of the Strait. It is misleading to imply that effluent fromthe proposed new system pumped directly into the fishing grounds of the Strait within 24 hourthat contains almost 1000kg of solids will have the same impact as the effluent whichpresently enters the Strait at the shore edge, hugs the shore and recirculates in and out ofPictou Harbour. Further to this, the same proposal was rejected in 1994 for the sameconcerns!! https://thetyee.ca/Analysis/2019/02/07/Pollution-Nova-Scotia-Pulp-Mill-Sink-Trudeau/? fbclid=IwAR2_XplvKgfjWHCh2fTuzimxmeMsnWVTVVhE6agYFPiXSwR3VvkEXHB4GEA https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/b61814_ab61cca668f1432f890d2d0a7715a554.pdf?fbclid=IwAR27oqDYJfCCBWdlMyNExvUrYZ_rBS86Gw77cT35IlLtVdyzh05AYwwcB1c 5.Better return for your TAX DOLLARS Nova Scotians are on the hook for the Boat Harbourclean up which is expected to be close to half a billion dollars once remediated. They also paidfor the design process of the proposed effluent process at a cost of $6 Million dollars and willbe expected to cover the construction, installation, labour etc for the proposed pipe estimatedat $100 Million dollars. Further to that $127 Million dollars of NS Tax payers dollars havebeen given to the mill in the last several years. Meanwhile we have doctors over worked andleaving our province.

Technologyinvestments of the past 50 years make it possible to protect our environment and encourageindustrial development, unlike the Boat Harbour facility as it currently sits.

The new plan is slightly better than the current condition but still allowing pollution tobe introduced in to a natural habitat at an alarming rate. A slightly lesser evil is still an evil.And this new evil is being moved to a location that is potentially allowing the bad decision toreach further into the eco system and not only affect the environment and people of thisprovince but neighboring ones. It is ridiculous that the tax payers of NS are on the hook forclean up of this companies negligent actions up until now due to the indemnity clause thatshould have never been approved, why on earth should we consider actions that will onlyincrease this bill into the future. while I am admittedly not completely informed about howmuch government money in the way of tax cuts or grants go to this antiquated mill, I am surethey are getting some financial backing from the NS tax payers. Perhaps this should stop andthe money be allocated to funding more environmentally sound companies to offset jobs thatmay be lost if the company were to pull up and leave because it didnt get its way and beallowed to continue to work towards destroying our environment. Why do we let foreigncompanies get rich at expense of our health and out land. I dont always agree with the viewpoints of our indigenous peoples but in matters like this they do prove to be better stewards ofthe natural resources than the rest of us more often than not. In closing I think the only waynorthern pulp should continue is in an updated facility that does not in any way further ourmarch into the climate crisis sitting before us and the measures that are required come out oftheir pockets not ours. If they decide they cannot part with the money required to be aresponsible corporate citizen then I am sure the savings to our taxpayers can go to help findbusiness partners who can.

The island is beautiful. Weswim there, dig quahogs and enjoy watching the ferry pass by every summer. We are literallya good golf ball drive from where Northern Pulp wants to have the outflow of its pipe. I seefirsthand every winter the huge amount of sea ice that comes into the strait and CaribouHarbour. The harbour and strait are very shallow in places. Just this fall we had a huge stormthat moved the entire beach and armour rocks. With rising oceans being the new normal, theextremes are only going to get worse and this pipe will not survive. What is in the pipe is alsoa problem. They say it is treated effluent but there will be solids and other leftover particlesfrom what I have read. Even if the effluent was completely clean it is not a clever idea torelease such a huge volume of fresh water into a salt water environment especially withtemperatures between 24 and 34 degrees Celsius. We spend most of the su mmer at the cottageand get to see firsthand where the lobster traps are set. Many are set exactly where NP wantstheir pipe to go. We also see in September hundreds of herring boats that drop anchor in theevenings who fish just to the left of where the pipe is going to go. I have a daughter and I do not want her to have to witness what the people of Pictou Landing have hadto do deal with and live with for the last 50 years. It is 2019, we know better now! We havenot been able to trust this company. They have had 5 years to come up with a better plan andhave let the citizens of NS and their own employees down by not doing so.

The people who have beenimpacted by effluent from the Northern Pulp Mill should be compensated financially by themill. The mill has negatively impacted the tourism industry in the Pictou area due to the foulodours emitted into the air. Another once prosperous industry - local fin fish and lobsterfisheries - may also being impacted by treated effluent but this has not been investigated bythe DFO although there is significant anecdotal evidence that this is the case. This mill hasreceived large government handouts to remain in business as it contributed so much to thelocal economy even though this is a foreign owned company which employs merely hundredsof locals.

Basically,Northern Pulp wants to redirect the majority of the flow from the Middle River \u00e2?\" between62 and 90 million liters per day, heat it up to 37 degrees Celsius, add one ton of what istechnically toxic waste solids, then direct that to the mouth of Caribou Harbour. This effluentwill kill lobster larvae it\u00e2?Ts inevitable and would directly breach section 36 of the FederalFisheries Act. The mill then states, \u00e2?~it\u00e2?Ts unlikely there will be any harm to lobster,\u00e2?T intheir environmental assessment. It is virtually impossible that there will not be adverse effectsfrom this dramatic redirection of the Middle River, to the mouth of Caribou Harbour. For ourProvincial government to have not immediately sent this to the Federal government forenvironmental assessment is outrageous. To suggest, \u00e2?~this is not a new facility, justreplacement of an existing one\u00e2?T, as the reason for a provincial assessment, is not reasonableor realistic. To completely redirect the flow of a major river to the mouth of Caribou Harbour,miles from where it\u00e2?Ts been flowing, into the very heart of the most lucrative lobster andherring grounds in the Northumberland Strait, a provincially shared Federal Fishing zone, thisgoes beyond responsible, honest government, with regards to the environmental assessmentapplied. Our government is in an obvious conflict of interest. The Supreme Court of Canadaagrees, according to the ruling of Justice Timothy Gabriel last fall, with regards to PictouLanding First Nations and the Provincial Government with respect to the government fundingof a replacement facility and the relationship with Northern Pulp. Justice Gabriel stated, \u00e2?o\u00e2?\u00a6it would essentially boil down to the Crown wearing one hat being called upon to determinewhether a project which the Crown wearing another hat has funded passes muster. This will donothing to assuage whatever cynicism has been engendered in the past.\u00e2? I believe theworking group of fishermen\u00e2?Ts organizations, together with Pictou Landing First Nations,should be taking the Province and Northern Pulp to Supreme Court on this basis in the eventthe Federal Government does not step in and take control of this environmental assessment. Ibelieve we, as fishermen and First Nations, have a legal right to protect our industry \u00e2?\" andJustice Gabriel has set the precedent. We undoubtedly will lose our Marine StewardshipCertification, a major marketing tool, for both our herring and lobster fisheries as a result ofthis new effluent pipeline, as part of the criteria is the species are harvested from a healthyenvironment, in a sustainable fashion. It\u00e2?Ts already affecting the existing fishery and not justhere, in P.E.I as well. Fishermen are anticipating the value of their enterprises to be less thanhalf what there are now, as soon as there is real indication of construction of this effluent pipeand some have literally already sold out on this realistic assumption. In Northern Pulpssubmitted proposal, the pipe is required to be set at a depth below the seabed of three metersdue to potential from ice damage. To accomplish this, they submit the trench would have to be9 meters across, for the entire length of 4.1 kilometers from where it enters the harbouradjacent to the ferry dock, to the mouth of the harbour, the proposed discharge location. Thesediment alone from this construction would destroy the local fishery and directly breachessection 35 of the Federal Fisheries Act as it will destroy marine habitat, eelgrass beds, etc.,killing juvenile fish, lobster and crab. The sediment dispersed will cause havoc with themarine environment for miles and for how long, is anyone\u00e2?Ts guess. There came a point in time when the environment outweighed the economy, it has passed. In this day and age, to even consider directing this massive flow of \u00e2?~treated\u00e2?T, poisonous effluent directly to the Northumberland Strait, is not reasonable. There is an alternative, yet the mill will not considerit, as it would mean less profits \u00e2?\" converting the mill to a mechanical process that separatesthe pulp, no effluent discharge required and less air emissions \u00e2?\" this actual possibility couldbe discussed at length. The mill simply will not consider it, as it is less profitable and therewould be \u00e2?~downtime\u00e2?T at their expense while converting. Our government is closing BoatHarbour in January 2020, ten years premature of the lease agreement, but actually 25 yearslate, from what was originally promised to Pictou Landing First Nations PLFN. To continueusing Boat Harbour, is to continue with the current environmental racism that PLFN havebeen enduring for 52 years and are currently, on a daily basis, contending with. To ask for anextension, is simply ignorant. Because the closure of Boat Harbour is premature of this leaseagreement that the Province agreed to without PLFN consent, Premier McNeil has beenquoted saying that the monies our government will be giving Northern Pulp are not to directlypay for the estimated $130 million 15.5 km pipe and new treatment facility, but in lieu of thelease agreements early closure\u00e2?\u00a6. Obviously, this $130 million could be better spent onconverting the mill to a mechanical, closed loop system. The mill has no interest and hascontinually stated, no pipe = no mill. If all you are thinking about is profits, you can\u00e2?Ttblame them. This company, Asia Pulp and Paper, subsidiary, Paper Excellence, buys upmothballed pulp mills for peanuts in comparison to today\u00e2?Ts cost, that would be upwards of2 billion dollars, spends next to nothing on upgrades, rakes in government subsidies and hand-outs\u00e2?\u00a6 and in the case of our mill, is not responsible for any environmental damage. What adeal! The mill with one of the worst environmental records in the country, suffers noconsequences for environmental damage \u00e2?\" a coincidence? Think about that, why would youimprove your discharges, air and water, if there are no consequences? No, you can\u00e2?Tt blamethem for not wanting to convert the mill. There would be downtime and they couldn\u00e2?Tt sueour government for it \u00e2?\" and they will be suing for any \u00e2?~downtime\u00e2?T when Boat Harbourcloses, you can count on that. They have a sweetest of deals right now and the fishing andforestry industries are both paying for it! The thing is, our government, the people, haveallowed this to happen. The question is, will we continue to? This mill is not worried aboutour marine environment and really, other than from a profits perspective, they are not worriedabout the longevity of our forest industry either. I don\u00e2?Tt suspect anyone in the forestindustry would want any harm to the fishing industry and I know the reverse is the same we inthe fishing industry want the forest industry to thrive, but simply not at our expense.

This plan was declined twice already in the past by federal level so Im unsure howthis is acceptable in 2019. It should also be noted this plan makes NO mention to ice scoursthat would damage the pipe at the caribou location. The people have continually stated we willnot accept a pipe. We know this would destroy our waters. The Supreme court has alreadyruled any future construction must be worked on with Pictou Landing first Nations. We thepeople are standing FIRM with this group. We believe many land demonstrations would occurand escalating incidents would happen. We do NOT WISH THIS. As a long time resident ofPictou County, I am ashamed at the true blatant corruption that has taken place since 1967regarding this mill. It is far too old to continue. CLOSED LOOP should be be the target. Ourmany reasons can be found here as well, why we a re demanding a federal assessment. Foryour health: The composition of the toxic effluent will contain dioxins, furans, metals, solidsand other contaminates at a rate of 90,000,000 Litres per day. Dioxins and furans can causevery serious health issues to humans and our food sources. Shellfish absorb dioxins and furansat 25,000-50,000 times the concentration in the water. The Northern Pulp treatment systemproposal includes a plan to burn the waste sludge. The waste sludge contains toxins whichwould be released through the stacks of the mill\u00e2?Ts power boiler. The proposal is to \u00e2?odewater the sludge prior to mixing it with bark and other wood waste for combustion in themill\u00e2?Ts power boiler.\u00e2? This is the same power boiler that is currently and repeatedly failingstack emissions tests. Problems with air quality from mill emissions have been documented foryears. Lack of appropriate monitoring and enforcement already puts area residents at risk.Now, Northern Pulp is considering adding sludge containing toxins to the combustion mix,increasing health risks from NP\u00e2?Ts air emissions. It is also important to note, the route of thiseffluent pipe goes through the source water supply for the town of Pictou and community ofCaribou and surrounding area.

For theenvironment \u00e2?\" Meeting regulations does not prevent harm Nova Scotia and theNorthumberland Strait are put at risk by the proposed effluent treatment process. As it standsright now, there are no CCME guidelines established for marine environments in terms ofsome of the chemicals and compounds that make up the pulp mill effluent. Pulp and PaperEffluent Regulations PPER in Canada cover two matters total suspended solids TSS andbiochemical oxygen demand BOD. Even though total discharges of TSS and BOD in pulp andpaper effluent decreased by approximately 90 and 97 respectively from 1970-2008, pulp milleffluents continue to have harmful impacts on fish, fish habitat and the environment.Information gathered through environmental effects monitoring EEM at all Canadian millspoints to the disturbing conclusion that although mills are meeting regulations and passing thePPER toxicity test, 70 are having harmful effects on aquatic life and habitat, and 55 are havingharmful effects on the larger environment. This information led the federal department of Environment and Climate Change to undertake a modernization review of pulp and paper effluent regulations in 2017. \u00e2?oResults from EEM studies and the changing realities of thepulp and paper industry indicate a need to modernize the PPER to improve environmentalprotection,\u00e2? the department states. If meeting regulations is not enough to prevent harm,neither is passing toxicity tests. Only one toxicity test is required under Canadian pulp andpaper regulations. The required LC-50 test is for acute lethality. For this test, an effluent isconsidered acutely lethal if the treated effluent at 100 concentration kills more than 50 of theRainbow Trout exposed to it during a 96-hour period. Long-term effects, including impacts onreproduction or growth, cumulative impacts on fish habitat and the larger environment oraccumulation of substances harmful for human consumption are not regulated under thePPER. Testing for environmental effects is required for information purposes. Only two millsin Canada test for and report impacts of effluent on the usability of fish resources by humans.Effluent from pulp and paper mills is regulated at the federal level principally by the Pulp andPaper Effluent Regulations PPER, which form part of the Fisheries Act. The standards thatapply to pulp effluent today were adopted in 1992 and have remained unchanged for 25 years.Highly toxic dioxins and furans are regulated under a separate Act. 70 of pulp paper mills arehaving harmful effects on aquatic life and habitat despite meeting current regulations. Longterm impacts on reproduction and growth are not regulated under PPER. Federal regulationscover only a few of the recognized harmful substances in pulp mill effluent. For example,there are no federal regulations for AOX compounds, a component of pulp effluent in millsthat bleach with chlorine or a chlorine compound. AOX compounds are recognized asextremely toxic. They are not easily broken down by bacteria and thus bioaccumulate in theenvironment. Yet they are not included in PPER regulations. Neither are phenols, toluene,chloroform or chemical oxygen demand COD. For 25 yrs the regulations that apply to pulpeffluent have remained unchanged. Provinces may go beyond Federal standards and adoptstricter regulations for effluent from pulp mills. British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario andQuebec have adopted stricter regulations. Nova Scotia does not have regulations, but setslimits through individual industrial approvals. The EU has more protective regulations thanCanada does. See also: Preliminary Receiving Water Study for Northern Pulp EffluentTreatment Plant Replacement, Pictou Harbour, Nova Scotia 4. The new treatment facility isnot better than the current one Northern Pulp\u00e2?Ts proposed new effluent treatment facilitydiffers from the present facility in a number of ways. In the present system untreated effluentis piped from the mill to the north settling ponds at Boat Harbour, where it remains for 12hours for primary treatment. It then moves to an aerated stabilization basin where effluent isplaced in contact with microorganisms. The effluent remains there for 8 days for secondarytreatment. After 8 days, the effluent is discharged from the aeration basin at what is known asPoint C, and treatment is considered finished. At point C, samples are taken for testing todetermine whether the treated effluent meets regulations. Point C is also a dead zone! Afterpoint C, the effluent enters the 300-acre Boat Harbour lagoon, also known as Boat HarbourBasin. Boat Harbour Basin was initially used as a stand-alone effluent treatment facility. In1972, settling ponds and an aerated stabilization basin were constructed to meet stricterregulations for pulp effluent treatment. Additional aeration and other upgrades were addedfrom 1992-1996, as the federal government again adopted stricter regulations. The lagoon atBoat Harbour has not been officially part of the effluent treatment system since 1972. Officialor not, treated effluent remains in the lagoon for an additional 20-30 days. Further aeration,settling, cooling, volatilization and breakdown of materials takes place during that time. Thisis referred to as \u00e2?opolishing\u00e2? or tertiary treatment. Natural springs and surface run offfurther dilute the effluent. According to Northern Pulp\u00e2?Ts figures, during the time in BoatHarbour Basin, total suspended solids TSS and biochemical oxygen below the proposed waterquality standard of 1.\u00e2? The Stantec Preliminary Receiving Waters Study, August 2017, illustrates the same lack of dispersion. Treated effluent has never flowed directly into the deeper waters of the Strait. From its discharge at the shoreline, after 20-30 days in BoatHarbour Basin, tides and currents further break down, dilute and settle contaminants beforethey reach the deeper waters of the Strait. It is misleading to imply that effluent from theproposed new system pumped directly into the fishing grounds of the Strait within 24 hourthat contains almost 1000 kg of solids will have the same impact as the effluent whichpresently enters the Strait at the shore edge, hugs the shore and recirculates in and out ofPictou Harbour. Further to this, the same proposal was rejected in 1994 for the same concerns!See also: How pollution from a Nova Scotia pulp mill could sink Trudeau on both coasts Fiftyyears of pulp effluent 5.

Theplan to mitigate the risk is weak at best and meets regulations. Meeting regulations is not goodenough when the Strait is at its max threshold for pressures. SEE BELOW FOR INFODIRECTLY FROM THEIR PROPOSAL Impact Evaluation/Effects Assessment The potentialenvironmental effects of the project and project activities on marine fish and fish habitat areassessed in the following section. Potential Effects Marine fish could be affected by activitiesand components of the project during the construction phase and operation and maintenancephase. If unmitigated, these changes have the potential to change marine fish populations andfish habitat e.g., adult fish, juveniles, eggs and larvae, invertebrates and marine plants throughdirect mortality or indirectly through alteration or destruction of habitat. The environmentalassessment of marine fish is focused on changes in marine fish populations. For the purposesof this assessment, a change in marine fish populations includes any physical injury ormortality on fish attributable to the project, and any destruction or alteration of habitat fromdisturbance of the marine environment. Construction Phase During construction, marine fishmay experience direct mortality or functional impairment resulting in eventual mortality. Theplacement of in-water infrastructure would have a direct effect on sessile or slow-movingdemersal fish and invertebrates as they would be unlikely to avoid construction activitieswithin the marine PFA and could experience mortality as a result of smothering or crushing.The construction of marine-based infrastructure may affect marine fish populations through achange in available substrate and size distribution, a change in water and sediment quality, orchanges to the acoustic qualities of the marine environment. The process of installing marinepipelines has a direct effect on the benthic environment. In-water activities during theconstruction phase may also result in a change in sediment quality. The disturbance of marinesediments may temporarily increase the concentration of TSS in the water column. Suspendedsolids can reduce feeding and growth rates and can alter migration of salmon in nearshorehabitats Robinson and Cuthbert 1996. Reduced feeding rates, avoidance behaviour andsuffocation due to effects on gill function have been observed in herring from suspendedsediments Robinson and Cuthbert 1996. There may also be indirect effects on fish throughalterations within localized food web structures. The severity of the effect of suspendedsediments increases as a function of sediment concentration and duration of exposureNewcombe and Jensen 1996. During the construction phase, vessel noise will be concentratedwithin the LAA and the majority of anthropogenic sound in the marine environment generatedduring construction will originate through trenching, pipe laying, and backfilling. There is alsothe potential for underwater sound if blasting is used during the construction phase. Somemarine fish species may be affected when exposed to high intensity sounds Popper 2003. Thesound emitted to the marine environment during the construction phase could thereforetemporarily reduce the quality of fish habitat in the marine PFA. Operation and MaintenancePhase Potential effects on marine fish and fish habitat during pipeline operation include thedischarge of treated effluent from the ETF. These potential effects could result from: anincrease in temperature, nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus, or TSS a change in colour,chemical and biochemical oxygen demand, dissolved oxygen DO, or pH or a reduction insalinity from the discharge of treated freshwater effluent into the Northumberland Strait.Lobster harvesters in the Pictou region have expressed concern about the potential effects of the discharge of treated effluent on lobsters, particularly in the larval stage.

Name: Email: Environment Assessment Web Account Subject: Proposed Project Date: February 13, 2019 1:38:31 PM Project: replacement_effluent_treatment_facility_project Comments: THE TOP 5 REASONS TO SUPPORT #NOPIPE 1. For your HEALTH The composition of the toxic effluent willcontain dioxins, furans, metals, 1000KG of solids and other contaminates at 90,000,000 LitresPER DAY. Dioxins and Furans can cause very serious health issues to humans and our foodsources. Shellfish absorb dioxins and furans at 25,000-50,000 times the concentration in thewater. The Northern Pulp treatment system proposal includes a plan to burn the waste sludge.The waste sludge contains toxins which would be released through the stacks of the mill\u00e2?Tspower boiler. The proposal is to dewater the sludge prior to mixing it with bark and otherwood waste for combustion in the mills power boiler. This is the same power boiler that iscurrently and repeatedly failing stack emissions tests. Problems with air quality from millemissions have been documented for years. Lack of appropriate monitoring and enforcementalready puts area residents at risk. Now, Northern Pulp is considering adding sludgecontaining toxins to the combustion mix, increasing health risks from NP\u00e2?Ts air emissions. Itis also important to note, the route of this effluent pipe goes through the source water supplyfor the town of Pictou and community of Caribou and surrounding area. http://ec.gc.ca/inrp-npri/donnees-data/index.cfm\u00e2?\u00a6 https://www.nrcm.org/\u00e2?\u00a6/cleaning-up-\u00e2?\u00a6/maines-dioxin-problem/\u00e2?\u00a6 https://docs.wixstatic.com/\u00e2?\u00a6/b61814_40a0f43682ee45d99af01fb\u00e2?\u00a6 2. For theoverall ECONOMY The proposed treatment system runs the risk of harming three lifelongIndustries worth close to $4 Billion dollars to the Nova Scotia economy. The tourism industryis worth $2.7 Billion and prides itself on warm, clean water and world class sandy beaches.The Commercial Fishing Industry is worth over $1 Billion and prides itself on sustainable wildshellfish that is shipped all across the world. The Sport Fishing industry is worth $56 Millionand the Northumberland Strait is home to the last remaining stable Atlantic Salmon stocks onmainland NS. All of this is at risk due to 32,000,000,000 Liters of waste water PER YEARthat will be 37 Celsius that will contain deleterious substances harmful to Fish species andhumans. https://docs.wixstatic.com/\u00e2?\u00a6/b61814_246fdf7e04a64e239be0fbf\u00e2?\u00a6https://novascotia.ca/news/release/?id=20180222001 https://docs.wixstatic.com/\u00e2?\u00a6/b61814_f856b6a7c7b34ffb9eba165\u00e2?\u00a6 3. For the ENVIRONMENT \u00e2?\" Meeting RegulationsDOES NOT Prevent Harm Nova Scotia and the Northumberland Strait has many greatresources. However, they are at risk with the proposed Effluent treatment process. As it standsright now, there are no CCME guidelines established for Marine Environments for some of thedifferent chemicals and compounds that make up the pulp mill effluent. Pulp and PaperEffluent Regulations PPER in Canada cover two matters total suspended solids TSS andbiochemical oxygen demand BOD. Even though total discharges of TSS and BOD in pulp andpaper effluent decreased by approximately 90 and 97 respectively from 1970-2008, pulp milleffluents continue to have harmful impacts on fish, fish habitat and the environment.Information gathered through environmental effects monitoring EEM at all Canadian millspoints to the disturbing conclusion that although mills are meeting regulations and passing thePPER toxicity test, 70 are having harmful effects on aquatic life and habitat, and 55 are havingharmful effects on the larger environment. This information led the federal department ofEnvironment and Climate Change to undertake a modernization review of pulp and papereffluent regulations in 2017. \u00e2?oResults from EEM studies and the changing realities of thepulp and paper industry indicate a need to modernize the PPER to improve environmentalprotection,\u00e2? the department states. If meeting regulations is not enough to prevent harm,neither is passing toxicity tests. Only one toxicity test is required under Canadian pulp and paper regulations. The required LC-50 test is for acute lethality. For this test, an effluent is considered acutely lethal if the treated effluent at 100 concentration kills more than 50 of the Rainbow Trout exposed to it during a 96-hour period. Long-term effects, including impacts onreproduction or growth, cumulative impacts on fish habitat and the larger environment oraccumulation of substances harmful for human consumption are not regulated under thePPER. Testing for environmental effects is required for information purposes. Only two millsin Canada test for and report impacts of effluent on the usability of fish resources by humans.Effluent from pulp and paper mills is regulated at the federal level principally by the Pulp andPaper Effluent Regulations PPER, which form part of the Fisheries Act. The standards thatapply to pulp effluent today were adopted in 1992 and have remained unchanged for 25 years.Highly toxic dioxins and furans are regulated under a separate Act. 70 of pulp paper mills arehaving harmful effects on aquatic life and habitat despite meeting current regulations . Longterm impacts on reproduction and growth are not regulated under PPER. Federal regulationscover only a few of the recognized harmful substances in pulp mill effluent. For example,there are no federal regulations for AOX compounds, a component of pulp effluent in millsthat bleach with chlorine or a chlorine compound. AOX compounds are recognized asextremely toxic. They are not easily broken down by bacteria and thus bioaccumulate in theenvironment. Yet they are not included in PPER regulations. Neither are phenols, toluene,chloroform or chemical oxygen demand COD. For 25 yrs the regulations that apply to pulpeffluent have remained unchanged. Provinces may go beyond Federal standards and adoptstricter regulations for effluent from pulp mills. British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario andQuebec have adopted stricter regulations. Nova Scotia does not have regulations, but setslimits through individual industrial approvals. The EU has more protective regulations thanCanada does. https://drive.google.com/\u00e2?\u00a6/1H1HltUnh9Oem_KpPHwxmye7z5\u00e2?\u00a6/view\u00e2?\u00a6 4.New treatment Facility is NOT BETTER Northern Pulp\u00e2?Ts proposed new effluent treatmentfacility differs from the present facility in a number of ways. In the present system, untreatedeffluent is piped from the mill to the north settling ponds at Boat Harbour, where it remains for12 hours for primary treatment. It then moves to an aerated stabilization basin where effluentis placed in contact with micro-organisms. The effluent remains there for 8 days for secondarytreatment. After 8 days, the effluent is discharged from the aeration basin at what is known asPoint C, and treatment is considered finished. At point C, samples are taken for testing todetermine whether the treated effluent meets regulations. POINT C is also a DEAD ZONE!!After point C, the effluent enters the 300-acre Boat Harbour lagoon, also known as BoatHarbour Basin. Boat Harbour Basin was initially used as a stand-alone effluent treatmentfacility. In 1972, settling ponds and an aerated stabilization basin were constructed to meetstricter regulations for pulp effluent treatment. Additional aeration and other upgrades wereadded from 1992-1996, as the federal government again adopted stricter regulations. Thelagoon at Boat Harbour has not been officially part of the effluent treatment system since1972. Official or not, treated effluent remains in the lagoon for an additional 20-30 days.Further aeration, settling, cooling, volatilization and breakdown of materials takes placeduring that time. This is referred to as \u00e2?opolishing\u00e2? or tertiary treatment. Natural springsand surface run off further dilute the effluent. According to Northern Pulp\u00e2?Ts figures, duringthe time in Boat Harbour Basin, total suspended solids TSS and biochemical oxygen below theproposed water quality standard of 1.\u00e2? The Stantec Preliminary Receiving Waters Study,August 2017, illustrates the same lack of dispersion. Treated effluent has never flowed directlyinto the deeper waters of the Strait. From its discharge at the shoreline, after 20-30 days inBoat Harbour Basin, tides and currents further break down, dilute and settle contaminantsbefore they reach the deeper waters of the Strait. It is misleading to imply that effluent fromthe proposed new system pumped directly into the fishing grounds of the Strait within 24 hourthat contains almost 1000kg of solids will have the same impact as the effluent whichpresently enters the Strait at the shore edge, hugs the shore and recirculates in and out of Pictou Harbour. Further to this, the same proposal was rejected in 1994 for the same concerns!! https://thetyee.ca/\u00e2?\u00a6/Pollution-Nova-Scotia-Pulp-Mill-Sink\u00e2?\u00a6/\u00e2?\u00a6https://docs.wixstatic.com/\u00e2?\u00a6/b61814_ab61cca668f1432f890d2d0\u00e2?\u00a6 5. Better return for yourTAX DOLLARS Nova Scotians are on the hook for the Boat Harbour clean up which isexpected to be close to half a billion dollars once remediated. They also paid for the designprocess of the proposed effluent process at a cost of $6 Million dollars and will be expected tocover the construction, installation, labour etc for the proposed pipe estimated at $100 Milliondollars. Further to that $127 Million dollars of NS Tax payers dollars have been given to themill in the last several years. Meanwhile we have doctors over worked and leaving ourprovince. We have ER closures and very long wait times for treatment and care. OurEducation system is also at its max with constant cuts. Funding for Seniors and Veterans aswell as many more public programs and services would benefit from the large sums of NS taxdollars instead of it going towards Northern Pulp. https://www.halifaxexaminer.ca/\u00e2?\u00a6/northern-pulp-scotsburn-\u00e2?\u00a6/\u00e2?\u00a6 Assessment Web Account Subject: Proposed Project Date: February 13, 2019 1:42:10 PM Project: replacement_effluent_treatment_facility_project Comments: There has been too much pollution and destruction already.

For those past 50 years, Effluent has been mixing in with the NorthumberlandStrait sea water, past the various Beaches, Cottages, and the very lucrative fishing grounds,and hey, we\u00e2?Tve been eating the fish, lobster, clams, etc., all that time.

Nice Job Jill Matt.

It\u00e2?Ts myunderstanding that the new Effluent Treatment System would be built on company property,and that once built, only treated effluent would be pumped off the property to theNorthumberland Strait, thereby removing the possibility of \u00e2?oun-treated effluent\u00e2? everreaching salt water. I\u00e2?Tve seen how difficult it is when my son, son-in-law, neighboursfriends have to \u00e2?oGo West\u00e2? for good paying jobs. Sure, most go for a couple weeks thenare back home for a couple, but some of them move their families out there too, will they everbe back at some point? While their gone, they\u00e2?Tre no longer paying taxes here, purchasingthose big items, or those everyday items. So who\u00e2?Ts left to pay taxes for Schools, Roads,Health Care, etc. That leaves fewer residents to pay, resulting in higher taxes!! Now is thetime for someone to bring these two groups together, to discuss this matter in a civil, courteousway, and work to get along. Usually I would suggest a Premier, MLA or the like, but they allseem to be fearful for their Jobs, as this has been \u00e2?oblown out of proportion\u00e2? . Possibly aJudge would be the answer, then both groups would have to remain quiet in the courtroom, ofcourse when speaking to the Judge, they would have to tell the truth!! prove what they arestating is true!! To the Environment Minister, I want my support to go to Northern Pulp, forthe Department of the Environment to grant the Industrial Approval, to grant an operatingextension to allow time to build the New Northern Pulp Onsite Effluent Treatment System,and to get that effluent treatment system operational, provided the science behind the project backs up the proposal, and that the system, once built is monitored operated to the Nova Scotia Canadian Pulp Mill Effluent Standards Regulations.

Nice Job Jill Matt. Northern Pulphas been purchased a couple of times in the past 15 to 20 years, they now have a new ownerthat wants to improve the Norther Pulp Mill, make it \u00e2?oWorld Class\u00e2? , improve the \u00e2?oAirEffluent\u00e2? emissions, wants to be a better business partner in the community. It\u00e2?Ts myunderstanding that the new Effluent Treatment System would be built on company property,and that once built, only treated effluent would be pumped off the property to theNorthumberland Strait, thereby removing the possibility of \u00e2?oun-treated effluent\u00e2? everreaching salt water. I\u00e2?Tve seen how difficult it is when my son, son-in-law, neighboursfriends have to \u00e2?oGo West\u00e2? for good paying jobs. Sure, most go for a couple weeks thenare back home for a couple, but some of them move their families out there too, will they everbe back at some point? While their gone, they\u00e2?Tre no longer paying taxes here, purchasingthose big items, or those everyday items. So who\u00e2?Ts left to pay taxes for Schools, Roads,Health Care, etc. That leaves fewer residents to pay, resulting in higher taxes!! Now is thetime for someone to bring these two groups together, to discuss this matter in a civil, courteousway, and work to get along. Usually I would suggest a Premier, MLA or the like, but they allseem to be fearful for their Jobs, as this has been \u00e2?oblown out of proportion\u00e2? . Possibly aJudge would be the answer, then both groups would have to remain quiet in the courtroom, ofcourse when speaking to the Judge, they would have to tell the truth!! prove what they arestating is true!! To the Environment Minister, I want my support to go to Northern Pulp, forthe Department of the Environment to grant the Industrial Approval, to grant an operatingextension to allow time to build the New Northern Pulp Onsite Effluent Treatment System,and to get that effluent treatment system operational, provided the science behind the project backs up the proposal, and that the system, once built is monitored operated to the Nova Scotia Canadian Pulp Mill Effluent Standards Regulations.

They are unwilling to finance a treatment which mightbe deemed to be safe and their new proposal most certainly will further damage ourenvironment on an even greater scale.\u00e2? ISSUE A: TRUST The AST proposed is untried at best and would require strict adherence to management of the processand honest evaluation which this Company has never illustrated. Northern Pulp is not theenvironmentally friendly entity it tries to portray. We have seen this evidence of uncaring inmany ways. In fact, the Public have rarely been able to trust a word they say!!! When wequestion or ask for clarification they don\u00e2?Tt respond. Polite inquiries are ignored. They haveeven suspended their Final Public Consultation! Also, I must make mention of the CommunityLiaison Committee that NS Environment told them they must set up in 2011. It still operatesridiculously \u00e2?ounder cover\u00e2? and they chose to lie that the members were selected by theEnvironment Dept. when in fact handpicked by NP. The push back by Northern Pulp againstthe Environmental Standards imposed in 2015 by the NS Government is a great example ofthe lack of any environmental conscience of Northern Pul p. This is proved by BruceChapman\u00e2?Ts published comments CBC regarding this issue. \u00e2?oToo expensive etc.\u00e2? This isa Company, Paper Excellence/SinarMas/Asia Pulp and Paper with a very bad record here inNS and internationally on caring for the environment. Also, a fact to know is that Asia Pulpand Paper is one of Asias largest debtors according to www.marketwatch.com As well, amongTen Top Corporate Criminals of 2018, listed by Global Exchange they are NUMBER ONE.Here in Nova Scotia they have been given millions of taxpayer dollars, an exact figureimpossible to discern. The arrogant opinion that they are too big to fail pervades their bullyingrelationship with Government and Community. Bottom Line: It appears that proponents ofPulp Mills are willing to harm human health, species, and the environment. They choose toignore these effects because of the economic benefits. Eventually NP may shut down when allthe fiber is exhausted leaving behind a wasteland. This is a questionable goal however youspin it. This Northern Pulp Mill is rickety and old, 25 years past its\u00e2?T lifespan. Only onestack has an air scrubber and the high vent roof opening is also used without emissionscrubbing. When their operating permit was up for renewal in 2015, they showed little regardfor our environmental standards here in Nova Scotia. Pictou area and PLFN were dangerousplaces to be during the times toxic chemicals in the Mills air emissions were spewed out thatwere 80 times the allowable limit. It had to be persistent pressure by residents to force them tocomply. Many people in our area suffered from Cancers as the statistics show. Breathingissues, asthma, bronchitis and COPD are off the charts. This of course ultimately is the fault ofthe Province but never once did the Mill owners ever speak up and acknowledge any changewas needed until forced by resident pressure. The odor is still horrendous much of the timeand a huge discouragement to our Tourist Industry. February 2019 Comment on Northern PulpReplacement Effluent Treatment Plan Page 2 We live in a beautiful historic town with fabulous scenic views. Many beautiful beaches and waterfront areas once enjoyedare in ruin. Of course, the health cases all rely on anecdotal information but recently we havelearned by a published peer reviewed Scientific Study by Emma Hoffman et al, 2017 inEnvironmental Science Pollution Research, that cancer causing VOCs have been emitted fromthe Northern Pulp Mill. No upgrades to emissions are presented. Their presence has caused massive clear-cutting of trees in our beautiful wild Nova Scotian forests which in turn has destroyed birds\u00e2?T nests and left no places for animals to live. We have a long list of Species at Risk here in NS. They carry out Glyphosate spraying on many hectares of woodlands everyyear this chemical is described by the WHO as a likely carcinogen and is banned in severalcountries. Their entire operation threatens the serious issue of Climate Change as treessequester carbon. FACT: Older trees and especially hardwoods sequester far more efficientlythan the young replacement trees, and future forest nutrients are lost in the remnant deadwoodthat we burn or pulp. Over the past 66 MILLION YEARS two major extinctions ago, the Earthhas never had more CO2 put into its atmosphere per year than this year [2018]. {Zeebe et al}.We must retain Carbon Sinks, not sell them out for Toilet Paper. Northern Pulp are a heavyburden on taxpayers and excepting their wages paid out and the economy of the local NSForest Industry their profits leave Canada lining the pockets of Billionaire owners. I realizetrust is not your issue to gauge but do not be taken in by their claims. Ensure our Regulatorylevels are effective, up to date and prove everything. A plan on paper or modelling is not goodenough for this untrustworthy company and such a high probability of disastrousenvironmental consequence. I am not Scientist, I did however spend 6 years with FRBHfxFisheries and Oceans during the 70\u00e2?Ts as a Research Technician studying the effects ofMethyl Mercury, PCBs and also Endocrine and Reproductive Changes on many species ofFish. This under the direction of I cannot accept \u00e2?oon faith\u00e2? the claims of this Company due to the trust issue and theunknown parameters they refuse to supply. In fact, there are those in the Community whobelieve that the Mill has no intention of ever building this treatment. Why have they waiteduntil now to commence and rush a process we are paying for? They had over four years todevelop knowing Boat Harbour would close in 2020. We also see their poor choices of PipeLine Route. The Caribou Route passes through two watersheds and the effluent in CaribouHarbour would be adjacent to Munroe\u00e2?Ts Island Wildlife Reserve and Caribou Park. I do notbelieve they will ever receive approval for this route. I have named this \u00e2?oWilfulIncompetence\u00e2? if true. They will simply shut down, blame the hostility of the communityand sue the NS Government for 10 years lost profit. As regards the ocean survey, even I wasable to go on line and in a few minutes understand the depth and type of bottom frompublished Navigation Charts created by BIO Hydrographers. The present route is totallyunacceptable: two watersheds on land, ice scour, dredging , lack of depth and disruption toHerring Spawning outside Caribou Harbour near outfall. February 2019 Comment onNorthern Pulp Replacement Effluent Treatment Plan Page 3 ISSUE B Beyond the Trust Issue is the Fail Safety of this new AST System. There are only 9 Hoursbackup for any industrial activities that break down, then the whole untreated raw pulpeffluent is dumped into the ocean. Even heavy rains may affect this ability to protect CaribouHarbour. And that figure represents 70-80 million liters of hot contaminated fresh watereffluent daily containing pulp chips. In addition to Human health being impacted by thepresence of toxic pulp chemicals in food fish, the other great worry is for the decline of thelucrative Fishery in the Northumberland Strait and for the health of all marine speciesincluding species of birds who prey on fish. ISSUE C is the known effect of Pulp Effluent onhealth to marine life. Death, suppressed reproduction, liver damage, abnormal growth andmalformations can occur. Northern Pulp seem unable or unwilling to supply chemicalcomponents of final effluent So let\u00e2?Ts speak about what we know about pulp and paperindustrial waste.

An overview of recent studies on the potential of pulp mill effluents to impactreproductive function in fish Oct 1998 Kelly Roland, Munkittrick, Mark E Mcmaster, L HMcCarthy, Glen Van Der Kraak. Deborah MacLatchy, a Biologist who has studied the effectsof pulp mills and currently serves as president of the University of Waterloo. says the twoissues around pulp mills are that if there are large amounts of nitrogen and phosphorous theycan cause eutrophication, which can lead to algae blooms and invertebrates changing innumbers and size. Eutrophication happens when an influx of nutrients causes excessive plantgrowth that in turn sucks the oxygen out of the water so that sea creatures can\u00e2?Tt breathe.The other issue is compounds that cause what we call endocrine disruption. \u00e2?oSo, the fish arebigger because of eutrophication but also their gonads are smaller and have less reproductiveability.\u00e2? As for the small gonads, the jury remains out on exactly which chemicalcompounds cause this. July 26, 2018 - Truro Daily News Speaking before the P.E.I.Legislature\u00e2?Ts Standing Committee on Agriculture and Fisheries Biologist Melanie Giffin,who works with the P.E.I. Fisherman\u00e2?Ts Association, said key Atlantic herring habitats inthe Northumberland Strait could be threatened by the proposed Northern Pulp pipeline inPictou Harbor*. FisheryNation.com October 20, 2018 *same effect is expected for CaribouHarbor due to close proximity-Pictou Harbour was the original route planned. Giffin said thefederal Department of Fisheries and Oceans has identified key ecologically significant areas inthe Southern Gulf of St. Lawrence. Theyve actually isolated three important areas in theSouthern Gulf of St. Lawrence. And those three important areas all surround the PictouCountry area, she said. There are currently few spawning beds for Atlantic Herring in theSouthern Gulf. Lady crab and winter skate populations, which are unique to theNorthumberland Strait, are already endangered. The white hake in St. George\u00e2?Ts Bay is alsoendangered. Truro Daily News July 16, 2018 Michael Van den Heuval UPEIBiologist/Researcher believes pouring between 60 to 80 million liters of treated effluent a dayjust outside the mouth of Pictou Harbour will have an effect. \u00e2?oYes, there is that risk. Hebelieves however it will impact a small area. The question is, are the level of the effectsacceptable to society?\u00e2? Maybe within 1000 Meters but nobody really knows. NP sayseffects only within 100 meters. Oddly enough however Dr seems to be the only opinion that reflects a little less concern on the environmental impacts. My commentshere: It is known that Eutrophication is deadly to the ocean. This will occur due to the additionof pulp chip solids 85 or less with TSS removal to the ocean to rot and consume all theoxygen. No oxygen, nothing lives and dead zones grow. The new system effluent treatmentwill produce far more solids than the old method which settled most of this material in BoatHarbor, 1000 kg solids minimum per day is the least load expected to be discharged The Construction phase of this pipeline obviously will endanger marine life.

A GOOGLE SEARCH OF WIKIPEDIA reveals: Wastewater discharges for apulp and paper mill contains solids, nutrients and dissolved organic matter such as lignin. Italso contains alcohols, chelating agents and inorganic materials like chlorates, also transitionmetal compounds and organochlorine compounds.

Althoughtoxic air emissions are reported to have affected local residents for decades, we are writingspecifically regarding the new Effluent Treatment Project proposal to close the Boat Harbourcontainment facility and to discharge 70-90 million liters per day of warm effluentcontaminated with toxic and persistent substances via a new pipeline directly to the richmarine environment, on the bed of the Northumberland Strait. 2018 Review on Toxicity ofPaper Mill Effluent on Fish Sangeeta Dey, Manabendra Dutta SuchismitaDas* Silchar, India Bulletin ofEnvironment, Pharmacology and Life Sciences Vol 2 3 2013 17 to 23 Online ISSN 2277*email: and papermills, controversially, are one of the largest and major contributors of pollution in aquaticenvironments, affecting aquatic organisms in general and fishes in particular. . . . . . . Manychemicals have been identified effluents which are produced at different stages of papermaking. Their toxic nature is derived from the presence of several naturally occurring andxenobiotic compounds which are formed and released during various stages of paper making.The pulp and paper mills rank high in terms of water use during paper production on the other hand they contribute to pollution loads in rivers through effluent discharges. Waste and wastewaters are generated from both of pulp and bleaching processes. The major problems of the wastewaters are high organic content, dark brown coloration, adsorbable organic halideand toxic pollutants. Toxic dyes, bleaching agents, salts, acids and alkalis are present ineffluents discharged from pulp and paper industries. Heavy metals such as cadmium, copper,zinc, and chromium are present in pulp and paper mill effluent that are ultimately released intoaquatic Environment. Dichloroguicol, trichloroguicol, tetrachloroguicol and chlorinatedphenols are major contaminants found in the effluent released from pulp and paper mill.Another Scientific reviewer of this subject is Walden 1976. Adoli et al. 2011 reported thatmean concentrations of Cd, Cu, Cr, and Zn in mosses 1 km radius of a pulp mill weresignificantly higher than reference stations, suggesting atmospheric emissions from pulp millsmay also contribute to local metal loadings. Atmospheric deposition of metals via the millssmoke stacks may likely continue post remediation, despite installation of a precipitator in2015 Hoffman et al.2015 My Words This may prove that AST treated effluent testing alonecannot be trusted to determine harm. Emission can contribute. As well, burning chemicalladen sludge as a treatment method will prove very harmful to air quality and Northern Pulphas offered no data to assure us otherwise. Dilution is not the solution. It must not beconsidered a treatment approach. In the moment perhaps, but clearly common sense tells usthe same amount of pollutants are expressed, only over a longer time frame. The test of fishlethality in a bucket of effluent is unreliable. February 2019 Comment on Northern PulpReplacement Effluent Treatment Plan Page 7 Issue D Achieving a Sustainable Future: Draft Strategy Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 A FederalSustainable Development Strategy for Canada states: marine pollution means the introductionby humans, directly or indirectly, of substances or energy into the sea that results, or is likelyto result, in \u00e2?\u00a2 a hazards to human health \u00e2?\u00a2 b harm to living resources or marineecosystems \u00e2?\u00a2 c damage to amenities or \u00e2?\u00a2 d interference with other legitimate uses of thesea. I do not believe that Northern Pulp Effluent can meet these requirements. They havedisplayed no monitoring credibility illustrated by undetected pipeline leaks and large airemission gaffes. In fact, the Mill displays all of the above noted dangers. Their proposal is notacceptable today or into the future. Summary: It is incredulous that proven damage by thisindustry world wide does not inform the Residents, Government and the ScientificCommunity that the harm to human health and the environment cannot be overlooked becauseof the social or economic benefits. There must be no effluent pipe approved for CaribouHarbour, Pictou Harbour, or any part of the Northumberland Strait. It is time we begin toremediate the damage caused in the past. To know better is to do better. The onus is on theCompany to demonstrate the absence of adverse effects and Northern Pulp has failedmiserably in this regard with a plan only on paper, lots of paper! Finally, it seems complianceto all laws and regulations is largely reliant on self-reporting or third parties hired by the Millbringing us back to the serious lack of trust issue. The Precautionary Principle can rule here. Ifthere is a lack of full scientific certainty, we must err on the side of caution. ... This participantstands firmly by this principle. Bruce Hatcher, a Cape Breton University biologist, also agrees-North Shore News Nov 29th 2018. While I acknowledge the limitations of presenting data dueto Northern Pulp not supplying their treatment information up front and this has made preciseassessments by residents challenging, one absolute truth remains: Boat Harbour must beclosed by January 2020 and the Pulp Mill by their own incompetence will not have a place foreffluent to go. PLFN citizens must never be taken advantage of again. They have suffered fartoo long! I believe our forest Industry will re-organize and rebound. I also support a FederalEnvironmental Investigation being conducted on this matter. All three Maritime Provinces areimpacted by environmental damage to Northumberland Strait including First Nations Fishers.Thank you for this opportunity.

The meeting of TSS,DO, pH and salinity within 2 meters and Colour within 5 meters as well as temperature within100 meters seems to be an excellent result. Especially considering the size of the body ofwater. 2. BOD being below 20 of Federal regulations and TSS being below 15 of Federalregulations indicate good performance in my mind. 3. The use of similar systems for similaroperations in Scandinavia should be seen as a positive indication. 4. Even though effluent hasbeen entering the Strait for 50 years, there appears to be a strong fishery. All evidence pointsto a continued strong fishery with a new treatment plant. 5. Significant study appears to havebeen done for all aspects of the environment, including birds, turtles, plants, etc. Studies showno significant impact. 6. There appears to be a mitigation plan for all foreseeable events duringconstruction and operation. 7. The choice of material for the new pipe seems appropriate. 5 cmthick pipe that is not susceptible to corrosion or decay. No thermal growth and flexible. 8. Asignificant spill basin to collect any effluent not meeting limits. This seems like a wellprepared document that should answer all reasonable questions and concerns. Based on this, Ican see no reason not to proceed.

This treated waste water should be so pure as to it being put into Pictous sewage plantwould cause no further contamination than the treated waste water from the Pictou sewagetreatment facility.

What I saw was horrible. I saw animals with massive lesions on themas well as missing tails that would not heal. the boat harbour fog would peel pain off houses sothe community began to use vinyl siding. Many people in Pictou Landing could not go outwhen the fog had rolled in off of Boat Harbour because of how hard it was to breathe. Whenyou look at the population of PLFN there is a high amount of cancer which may not be relatedto Boat Harbour but when you look at other communities of similar size that is not an issuelike it is in PLFN. Fish kills were frequent near the release point into the NorthumberlandStrait not in boat harbour yet no explanation was given other than they suffocated. Fish do notsuffocate in water. My family told me many stories of how they were promised that nothingwould happen to our fisheries, huntin g and gathering lifestyles but the day the effluent startedto pour into Boat Harbour is the day that all fish died massive fish die off occurred and so withit went our lifestyle. We now cant take anything from in or around the effluent. moving theeffluent to another area without eliminating 100 of the risks to harm the fishing industry,tourist industry or the Rights of the Mikmaq to gather food for personal use, social use orceremonial use in and around the Northumberland Strait area should be closely monitored bythe federal departments of Fisheries and Oceans and the Indegenous Affairs departments.Impacting our FSC Rights should not occur because the SCC protects those Treaty Rights andif they are impacted in any way then the Federal Government should defend our Rightsbecause they have a fiduciary right to protect the Mikmaq and the treaties we signed.

Environment Assessment Web Account Subject: Proposed Project Comments Date: February 15, 2019 12:22:38 AM Project: replacement_effluent_treatment_facility_project Comments: The content and length of this proposal are beyond my ability and presumably that of most of the public to fullyreview and analyze, so my comments will focus on the proposal and review process ratherthan the content of these documents. - With the province on the hook for an unknown amountof money related the ending the boat harbour lease, which seems to be dependant on the costof building this new facility, there appears to be a conflict of interest / potential bias in alsohaving the provincial government acting as the sole reviewer of the environmental assessment.The close connections between Northern Pulp\u00e2?Ts lobbyists and the current liberalgovernment only add to this concern. - Regardless of any pressure related to the deadline forthe closure of boat harbour, the proper amount of time needs to be taken to complete reviews,and if needed, to redesign the proposal. Base on their own public engagement materials,Northern Pulp did not initiate an environmental assessment until 2 years after the BoatHarbour Act was passed. They have now submitted their last minute proposal only afteralready stating that they will not meet the deadline, putting increased pressure on theassessment to pass or further delay the project. Their failure to expedite the project should notallow them to bypass a thorough review. - The loss of the mill, either temporarily orpermanently, would certainly have a negative effect on mill employees and the local forestryindustry, but this in and of itself does not mean that the project should go forward. If thisindustry cannot be both environmentally and economically sustainable at the same time, itshould not be one that Nova Scotia supports. If the entire forestry industry is dependant on thisone mill as they have been saying, they should step up and help fund a proper treatmentfacility if the outcome of the assessment is that the proposal is not adequate. - I believe that aClass 2 provincial assessment and/or a federal assessment would be appropriate in this case, toensure a complete and impartial review is conducted.

Too bad other forms ofwaste treatment systems polluting the waterways would put this much concern and money intotheir waste treatments. Unfortunately there are multi thousands of pollutants polluting ourenvironment...and until the proper technology is built in the future to eliminate thiscompletely...shutting down ONE mill and causing major chaos is not going to achieveanything, but only create more problems. Until a complete solution is derived in the futurewhich will not happen overnight...the best we can do is uphold all waste systems to the highestlevel of regulations to reduce our impact on the future, which I truly believe Northern Pulp isachieving. First Nations will get their land cleaned up...and Northumberland Straight will getthe absolute least and safest TREATED was te possible globally.Boat Harbour has beenrunning their treated waste to the straight for decades...not understanding why now thefisherman are concerned??...especially now that the waste will be of a higher quality ofstandards Im afraid if this one company is forced to closed, regardless of the FACT that allregulations are met, all industries with any kind of environmental waste will be heavily underthe scope, including thousands of boats in the straight on a regular basis also polluting thewaters.

I am an engineer withalmost 40 years experience in the pulp and paper industry in Canada. Most of that time in thekraft pulp industry, including many years in the environmental side of the business. I havetraveled to many mills in Canada and the United States to conduct audits and share ideas. Ihave been following this issue from the beginning, and given the misinformation in the publicdiscourse, I feel it necessary to make a few important comments for your consideration. Irecently took time to read Northern Pulp\u00e2?Ts environmental assessment submission posted onyour website in its entirety, including all appendices for a total of 1735 pages. It is comfortingto learn that Northern Pulp has consulted many world class experts in the subject matter in thecreation of this environmental assessment. This environmental assessment is as complete andcomprehensive and any I have read. It is a very large and comprehensive assessment thatdeserves thorough evaluation by knowledgeable and skilled individuals. I expect that you willneed to go outside the department for that expertise and understanding. Please don\u00e2?Tt beguided by the incorrect and misinformed reports appearing in the public and the media whenmaking your decision. According to the department, the environment assessment process isdesigned to \u00e2?oto identify the environmental impacts associated with designated developmentundertakings long before the proposals are implemented\u00e2? and its purpose is to \u00e2?opromotesustainable development by protecting and conserving the environment by identifying andassessing possible adverse effects on the environment before a new undertaking begins.\u00e2? Isupport this process and its goals completely. I trust that decisions will be based on facts andscience, and not emotion and misleading or false information. If these decisions are allowed tobe made on emotion the process will fail for all. This project has had lots of press and loudpublic opposition, but most do not understand the kraft pulp process or the treatment of kraftmill effluent. I urge you to put the emotion and noise aside and make you decision based onthe science and track record of similar projects to the one proposed. If this process would havebeen followed when the existing system at Boat Harbour was constructed by the provincialgovernment, it would have been built to the best technology of the day. This includes aproperly designed outfall, which would have eliminated many of the legacy issues thatplagued the existing situation from its beginning. It is important to note the provincialgovernment used promises to provide a water supply and to treat effluent as \u00e2?obait\u00e2? toattract industry to the area. Three companies would ultimately be attracted by this deal. Thesewere large multinational foreign companies Scott Paper and Michelin Tire, and a few yearslater CIL set up operations near the mill site. The province failed to live up to their end of theagreement by cutting corners and failing to construct a facility and treat the effluent aspromised. This failed the residents of Pictou County including the Pictou Landing FirstNation, as well as the industries they convinced to set up in Pictou County. In doing so theycreated a legacy that cannot be changed no matter how well or poorly the existing system isoperated. It is also important to note that since the beginning in September 1967, thegovernment has had many opportunities to correct the situation by constructing a proper treatment system and outfall that could have changed the course of local history. They failed to do so because of cost, political will or whatever were the issues of the day. Effluent from this facility has been going to the strait since September 1967. For the first few years, from1967 until 1971, there was no manmade treatment. The government\u00e2?Ts concept was to relyon nature\u00e2?Ts ability to break down organics in the natural tidal estuary known as BoatHarbour to provide whatever treatment it could. The results were unacceptable to everyone inthe area. The system slowly evolved through development with various levels of success andfailure until 1996, when the system was leased to the mill operator to operate. Until 1996 theprovincial government had full operational control. This arrangement was functionally parallelto the current situation in municipal government, where residents\u00e2?T homes connect to thesewage system and the municipal governments treat and release the effluent. When the milltook control of operations, a redesign was conducted and additional aeration, instrumentationand other equipment was installed so that it could operat e reliability within the federal Pulpand Paper Effluent Regulations PPER. The Northern Pulp kraft mill is typical of many kraftpulp mills around the world. The kraft process has remained much the same as it has since thefirst kraft mill was built in 1947. While the equipment is bigger, more sophisticated andconstructed with better materials, the chemistry remains much the same. It is the mostextensively used chemical pulping process in the world. It is used in first world countrieswhere there are extensive environmental laws and in developing countries where there are fewrules. Northern Pulp\u00e2?Ts effluent treatment process is also comparable to many kraft mills.My point is the treatment process proposed is tried, true and tested. We can be verycomfortable in the process selected and the equipment supplier. Veolia is a leader in thesupply of effluent treatment to mills and municipalities in Canada and around the world.Treatment system designer KSH Solutions has successfully designed effluent treatmentsystems for many world-class mills arou nd the world. One of the most vocal opponents toimproving the current situation is the lobster fishers. They are concerned the effluent willaffect the lobster fishery. They seem to have forgotten that the effluent has been going to theNorthumberland Strait since September 1967. If there are any issues with the lobsters caughtin the area of the current outfall the fishers have kept that a secret. In fact, some have braggedabout how good they are. Since the mid 1960s then the lobster catches have almost tripled inzone 26A -- the area encompassing the current system outfall into the strait. This can beconfirmed by DFO. Surely any long term effects would have presented in the ensuing 52 yearsof continuous fishing in zone 26A, beginning with a decline in fish stocks. The PPER requirethat each mill maintain an Environmental Effects Monitoring EEM program. These programsstudy the environmental effects of the effluent on the marine environment. This is a veryrobust scientific program that is administered through the Environment and Climate ChangeCanada. They have scientists that specialize in this field. The EEM takes an iterative approachthat looks for changes and studies the effects in a deeper and deeper way. The studies andreports are very scientific and undergo peer review to ensure the science is solid and accurate.Environment Canada directs the study for each cycle, drilling down on differences from theprevious cycle that are discovered. No other industry in Canada goes through such anextensive critical assessment of the effects at the end of the pipe. See appendix J for the Cycle7 results. Other EEM reports are available for those who are interested from Environment andClimate Change Canada. I was interested to understand how the mill\u00e2?Ts treatment systemcompares to others we generally believe to be good systems, including those we don\u00e2?Tt hearof in the media as we do Northern Pulp. I was interested to compare the treated effluentcoming from the proposed Northern Pulp facility to that of other industries in the Atlanticregion. Also, in the interest of fairness, I studied a number of industries that also dischargeinto the marine environment. I reviewed scientific reports regarding farming, fish processingand municipal effluent and their effects on the environment in the region. Mike van denHeuvel, director of the Canadian Rivers Institute at UPEI, is also a Canada Research Chair in Watershed Ecological Integrity. He and his counterparts have studied the Northumberland Strait extensively and recently published a study entitled \u00e2?oNitrogen Loading Criteria ForEstuaries In Prince Edward Island.\u00e2? They determined that agriculture -- particularly in PEI-- is having a major impact on nitrogen loading in the Strait, and not the mill as some willclaim. The mill\u00e2?Ts outfall even as it is today has very little effect on the NorthumberlandStrait. Said plainly, the science contradicts what is being claimed by fishers and activists in thearea. I was very disappointed to learn that fish processing plants on marine environments notconnected to a municipal sewage system have amazing lax regulatory requirements to treateffluent. The only requirement is that they must have a 25 mesh screen on the pipe and thepipe must not be visible during low tides. Anything and everything they want to dispose ofgoes down the pipe without regulation, requirement for testing, concern about effects, orquestion by the regulators. Truly amazing in these highly regulated times. Why aren\u00e2?Tt thefishers interested in this? In also learned that these plants have very high suspended solids andBiological Oxygen Demand BOD loading many times more that the mill outfall. There is alsono requirement to conduct any testing. The water usage is also very high given the size ofthese facilities. Water is used extensively for conveying the product and during cleaning. I wassurprised to learn that the chemicals used in these facilities are simila r to a kraft mill. Causticfor cleaning equipment and chlorine for sterilizing. In many ways the effluent characteristicsare similar. The AOX parameter in their effluent is two to three times that of a kraft pulp mill.I was also interested to compare the mill\u00e2?Ts effluent treatment system to municipal units inNova Scotia. I selected the towns of Pictou and New Glasgow with treats sewage forStellarton, Trenton and Westville and some surrounding areas as well as local systems forcomparison. I also examined two of the three new systems constructed as part of the HalifaxHarbour Cleanup Project: The Water Street Treatment Facility and the Dartmouth MawiomiStreet Treatment System. Both were constructed as part of the much-publicized HarbourCleanup Project which for the first time stopped raw sewage from entering Halifax harbour. Iused the Freedom of Information Act to obtain their operating Approvals and sample reportsof the data they are required to submit as part of their operating approvals. Effluent flow fromthe proposed Northern Pulp mill system is significantly larger than that of the Town of Pictou,population 3186 2016 census which is not unexpected. Surprisingly, it was only 4.7 timeslarger than the Town of New Glasgow. When flow is compared to the Halifax plants, I wassurprised to learn that the Northern Pulp facility is 5.2 times smaller than the Water Streetfacility and 3.4 times smaller than the Mawiomi facility. Interestingly, the press and opponentsto the system would lead you to believe that Northern Pulp\u00e2?Ts effluent volume is larger thanall of the Halifax\u00e2?Ts 14 treatment systems. I concluded that while the Northern Pulp facilityis large, it is not unusually so for Nova Scotia, contrary to what we have been lead to believe.The proposed treatment system for Northern Pulp includes a primary treatment processfollowed by a secondary treatment. The primary treatment consists of a coarse screen toremove the very large pieces followed by a clarifier to remove suspended solids carried in thewater. The secondary treatment -- the most important step -- is a biochemical treatmentprocess which breaks down the constituents that remain in the effluent. The process selected isan MBBR process combined with activated sludge process. This results in a highly efficientand compact design. These processes have proven very successful in treating pulp milleffluent. Activated sludge systems have been used for many years in both industry andmunicipal sewage treatment plants around the world. It\u00e2?Ts proven and reliable technology. Infact, both the New Glasgow and Pictou municipal systems are activated sludge processes andproduce good results. Only one of the three systems constructed for the Halifax Harbour CleanUp project employ secondary treatment. The two largest systems -- at Water Street andMawiomi Street -- are primary treatment only systems. They do not use biochemicaltreatment. These systems do not treat for E. coli or other harmful biological elements. Both systems\u00e2?T operating approvals recognize this and allow for unlimited E.Coli releases except during the summer months May 1 through to October 31 when it\u00e2?Ts limited to 5000 CFU per100 ml of effluent. E. coli is a bacterium commonly found in the intestines of humans andother animals, some strains of which can cause severe food poisoning. This can make peopleseverely ill with vomiting, diarrhea and potentially kidney failure. Northern Pulp\u00e2?Ts currentsystem has secondary treatment in the form of an Aerated Stabilization System and does notrelease E.coli. The proposed system is will also not release E. coli. When comparing the otherprimary treated effluent parameters Biological Oxygen Demand BOD and Suspended Solids,the Northern Pulp facility is designed for half the approval limits of both Halifax systems.Regarding BOD this is 25mg/l for the mill versus 50 mg/l for the Halifax systems. Whencomparing suspended solids the Northern Pulp\u00e2?Ts facility is 25 mg/l versus 40 mg/l for theHalifax systems. Another very important parameter is toxicity. Local opposition groups andthe media repeatedly and incorrectly report that the existing effluent released from BoatHarbour is toxic. This is incorrect. Records submitted to both provincial and federalenvironment departments show the effluent has consistently passed the toxicity test.Independent tests conducted by Environment Canada have confirmed this. Records obtainedthrough Freedom of Information requests show that both the Water Street and Mawiomi Streetfacilities failed toxicity tests in 2007 on a number of occasions. This is a clear violation oftheir operating permit. Interestingly, not a word in the press or any charges laid by provincialor federal regulators. Why is Northern Pulp treated differently? The Northern Pulp treatmentsystem is clearly less harmful to the environment. Furthermore, all municipal systems aredesigned to overflow, whereby untreated sewage is allowed to bypass the treatment facilityand be re leased directly into the receiving waters. Indeed, all municipal systems I obtainedinformation on had numerous occasions of such overflow. There has been much talk abouthigh cancer rates in Pictou County and much of the blame has been placed on the Mill. InSeptember 2018 the Nova Scotia Health Authority released their latest study entitled NovaScotia Incident and Survival Rates September 2018 based on province wide data collectedfrom 2011 to 2015. This documents the incidence of cancer by type and region. It is clear thatPictou county has a slightly lower that average cancer rate than the rest of the province. Thereare other studies that confirm this information. Please do not be misled by inaccurateinformation in the public domain. In closing, I encourage you to make your determination byexamining the science and the merits of this project and not on the largely inaccurateinformation put forward by the project\u00e2?Ts opponents and repeated in the press. There isample information in the EA submission to make this judgement. There are many workers andtheir families from across this province that depend on the jobs that this business and relatedbusinesses provides. They deserve that your give this a fair and unbiased review. This is animportant project for all of Nova Scotia and I believe it should proceed.

Name: Email: Environment Assessment Web Account Subject: Proposed Project Date: February 17, 2019 10:28:02 AM Project: replacement_effluent_treatment_facility_project Comments: I am writing to provide feedback to the Northern Pulps 1200 page proposal to conduct a new effluent treatmentfacility at its Abercrombie Point location in respect to whether or not your department shouldrecommend a federal environmental assessment. Taken from NP proposal: The proposedproject will consist of building a new effluent treatment facility ETF on NPNS propertyincluding a pipeline to transport treated effluent to Caribou Harbour. Ultimately, the effluentdischarge will be into the Northumberland Strait, as has been the case since 1967 via theexisting facility. The installation of a modern engineered diffuser provides an improvement ineffluent dispersion. The improvement is such that as unlike the visual impact experiencedtoday, it is anticipated that the effluent plume will not be visible when it reaches the water\u00e2?Tssurface. This opening statement shows exactly how the rest of the document will read. NPcalls it a new effluent treatment facility which in itself should trigger the federal assessment.NP then states that the effluent discharge will be into the Northumberland Strait as has beenthe case since 1967 via the existing facility. We have seen what that has done to Boat Harbourand the surrounding area so why is it o.k. to continue to pollute the Strait in an area where itwill not be visible to the majority of the public. How many people other than fishers will be inboats 4 miles off the coastline? Does this make it o.k. to pump the effluent into the Straitbecause no one can see it happening or because it has been happening for the last 50 years asthe proposal states? Just because the new diffuser will supposedly provide an improvement ineffluent dispersion doesnt mean that it is better see comments below . What about thetemperature difference of the effluent? According to NP the area affected will only be 100mfrom the discharge site. This is based on supposition not scientific fact and will have severeconsequences to the fisheries food over pulp please for years to come. Potential environmentaleffects are identified and predicted for both the construction and the operation andmaintenance phases of the project. The residual environmental effects of each project phaseare evaluated as either not significant \u00e2?oNS\u00e2?, significant \u00e2?oS\u00e2?, with the likelihood ofoccurrence identified in such cases, or positive \u00e2?oP\u00e2?. The environmental effects ofaccidents, malfunctions and unplanned events as well as cumulative environmental effects ofthe project in combination with other past, present, or reasonably foreseeable future projects oractivities are also assessed. The table that is listed on page xxiv of the proposal summarizedthe studies, and the effect of the project for the significance of the project related residualenvironmental effects of the project. I was amazed to see that all categories were predicted asNS - No Significant Residual Environmental Effects Predicted. However, in reading furtherinto the proposal I have discovered many other areas of concern. Detailed design has not beencompleted for the construction of the marine outfall and pipeline. The preferred method fortrenching the marine pipeline will likely be by side-cast excavation methods with re-use ofbottom materials without bringing to surface. And comments such as The treated effluent isanticipated to meet complianceetc. are littered throughout the document. The whole documentis written with not been completed or \u00e2?oto be determined\u00e2?. On numerous items the proposalstates that it is not possible to know or needs more assessment due to the pipeline beingdefined in the fall of 2018. Again another reason for a federal assessment. Although NP hashad 5 years to adjust to the new reality that Boat Harbour was closing, they have submitted ahalf-baked proposal, at the 11 hour with lots of what if and projections without any scientificdata to back them up. This is not the fault of the population of Nova Scotia but we will have tosuffer the costs both in air and water quality for NP dragging their feet and now trying to ram their proposal through. As one writer to the Herald stated \u00e2?oIf one lobster from the Northumberland Strait is found to be tainted with chemicals, it will not be recorded as a Northumberland Strait lobster, but a Maritime lobster. The whole Maritime fishing industry isat stake. I understand that jobs are at stake here but there is more to consider than theeconomic benefit from one mill. There are other industries that are affected by NP destructionof the environment, notably the fisheries 1 Billion and tourism 2.7 billion. Together these twoindustries outstrip the benefits of NP. The health reasons of dumping 85,000 litres per day of anoxious mixture of dioxins, furans, metals and solids and other contaminates into a watersource is inconceivable to me in this day and age of knowledge. Coupled with that, the millwants to burn the sludge in the power boiler. This is the same boiler that has failed stackemissions tests Northern Pulps failed stack test happened the week of June 6 at a reading of224, 50 over allowable levels although I understand from NP proposal that A frequentexceedance is defined as one that occurs more than 1 of the time. On page 140 under section8.1.2.2 the proposal states that there have been no exceedances of maximum allowances. Thisis based on their own assessment. In the proposal NP quotes a recent paper by Hoffman et al.2017 who evaluated ambient air levels of seven volatile organic compounds VOCs, based onambient monitoring data reported from the National Air Pollution Surveillance NetworkNAPS. There are two NAPS monitoring stations near the NPNS mill that have historicallymonitored for VOCs. This paper focused on ambient monitoring data for the following VOCs:chloroform 1,3-butadiene vinyl chloride benzene carbon tetrachloride trichloroethylene and,perchloroethylene. The paper reported that results of the conducted temporal and spatialstatistical analyses indicated that 1,3-butadiene, benzene, and carbon tetrachloride airconcentrations routinely exceeded EPA air toxics-associated cancer risk thresholds, and that1,3-butadiene and perchloroethylene levels in air were signifi cantly higher when theprevailing wind direction blew from the northeast and the NPNS mill towards the GrantonNAPS site. Conversely, when prevailing winds originated from the southwest towards themill, higher median VOC air toxics concentrations at the NAPS site, except carbontetrachloride, were not observed. These outcomes have not been corroborated by regulatoryagencies or other parties at this time. While this study was quick to attribute elevated ambientVOC concentrations to the NPNS mill based on a spatial and temporal evaluation only i.e., astatistical evaluation of ambient data in correlation with wind direction, without further sitespecific investigation, it did not attempt to rule out contributions from other potential sourcesof VOCs in the area e.g., transportation sources, or other industrial sources like the Michelintire plant or the Trenton coal-fired power plant, presumably all sources of VOC emissions tosome degree. So NP refuses to believe that they could be the source of air pollution but wouldprefer to blame it on other industries in the area. As far as the total environment foot print,meeting current PPE regulations does not mean that harm is not happening. Regulations forpulp mills were updated in 1992 and are concerned with biochemical demand and suspendedsolids. As it stands now, there are no CCME guidelines established for some of the differentchemicals and compounds that make up the pulp mill effluent. It is not acceptable to follow 27year old legislation so once again, a federal assessment should be considered. The newtreatment facility is being touted as better than the old. I have several concerns and commentson this. It is my understanding that the current set up has the discharge going into theNorthumberland Strait after a 12 hour primary treatment in the settling ponds, then moves toan aeration basin where effluent is placed in contact with micro-organisms and sits there for 8days after which the effluent is discharged into Boat Harbour lagoon basin where it remainsfor an additional 20-30 days. Further aeration, settling, cooling, volatilization and breakdownof materials take place during that time. In the proposed new Activated Sludge Treatment ASTsystem on the mill site, effluent will move through a primary clarifier to an aeration basinusing micro-organisms to break down pollutants, and then to a secondary clarifier. Theprocess will take less than 24 hours. Northern Pulp states that effluent from the new system, including an added oxygen delignification system, will be similar to treated effluent leaving the present system at point C, with some unspecified reduction in biochemical oxygen demandBOD. However, the effluent being released from the proposed new system directly into thedeep waters of the Strait will not benefit from the considerable reduction in BOD, TotalSuspended Solids TSS and other contaminants including heavy metals which takes placeduring the 20-30 days that effluent presently remains in the Boat Harbour Basin stabilizationlagoon. Northern Pulp has not provided a detailed comparison between the effluent whichpresently reaches the edge of the Strait and the effluent they propose to release into the fishinggrounds with the new system. The present effluent outfall location at the shore edge does notdisperse effluent in the Strait in the same way that the proposed new outfall site would. Withthe proposed new system, 70million litres of treated effluent would be pumped directly andcontinuously into the prime fishing areas of the Strait every day. Ocean environments areincreasingly stressed. The Northumberland Strait Ecosystem Overview Report, prepared forDFO in 2007, documents increasing stresses on the Strait. To state that there are otherindustries producing stresses does not make it alright for NP to increase this toxicity and tothink otherwise is just plain insanity. In terms of toxicity, my understanding is that there isonly one test required to meet federal regulations. This test measures acute toxicity -- whether50 of rainbow trout die when exposed to effluent for 96 hours. It does not measure impacts onfish growth or reproduction or on fish habitat. No toxicity test on salt water fish is required tomeet federal regulations. There are no federal regulations for a number of known harmfulsubstances in pulp effluent, including AOX and phenols so further study is needed before thispipe is installed. We cannot wait for updated PPER legislation slated for publication in 2022.NP lists Alternatives Considered for Final Discharge Location or Method. Discharging intoPictou Harbour is not recommended due to the lack of mixing with the Strait as if mixing witha larger body of water is acceptable, Release into the Middle River upstream was notconsidered due to expectations that it will increase chlorides in the Middle River andpotentially affect the maintenance of the equipment at the Middle River Pumping Station andinside the mill but once again it is o.k. to dump on fishing grounds. The municipal stations andprivate facilities do not have the capabilities to handle the volume nor is a land based optionavailable because as proposal states: Land application of wastewater effluent has not yet beenapproved in Nova Scotia small wonders, Trucking or barging the sludge to a different locationis not recommended. I found the barging comments interesting: A pier for barge loadingwould be necessary - assumed to not be at the NPNS mill location. L iquid would have to beeither stored and trucked or stored and pumped to a facility to offload to an ocean goingbarge/tanker to be discharged outside of coastal waters in an approved area, with a largenumber of tankers. There would be increased industrial vessel movements in theNorthumberland Strait, potentially disrupting fisheries. Project specific permits would berequired as the effluent does not fall under materials permitted to dispose of offshore. NP isconcerned about the increase in traffic in the Strait but not about the effluent that will bepumped there. Why would they need project specific permits if effluent does not fall undermaterial permitted to dispose of offshore but using a pipeline to dump the effluent is allowed?A closed loop system is not economically viable according to Northern Pulp. NP also states:The main problems with the bleach plant effluent recovery are equipment corrosion andaccumulation of chloride and non-process elements in the mill\u00e2?Ts water systems.Accumulation of chlorides and potassium are especially corrosive for the mill\u00e2?Ts boilers andoften lead to scale build-up which would require the replacement of the boiler over time.However NP also argues that it would not be economically viable for NP however they arequick to boast of the annual volume of income at $535 million. If the chemicals used are toocorrosive for the river and too corrosive to recycle in their own equipment, how can pumpingthe effluent into the Northumberland Strait be a viable solution? Surely dispersing sludge over a larger area is not the answer. And what happens if NP sticks around until the end of the lease in 2030. Who is going to clean up the mess then? Who is going to compensa te the fishing andtourist industry? This are too many other stakeholders involved to let this go through without aFederal Assessment. I havent even commented on the state of the health industry in NovaScotia that could use the money being spent on NP. NP has already received $127 milliondollars in tax payer\u00e2?Ts dollars over the years. We have paid for the design process of theproposed effluent process at a cost of $6 million dollars and will be expected to cover the costof the construction, installation, labour etc. for the proposed pipe estimated at $100 milliondollars. How can NP be allowed to pollute the environment as they have in the past and howcan we as citizens believe anything that NP puts out in the media about how wonderful theyare when history has shown otherwise? I would rather put my tax dollars towards the penaltyof breaking the lease if need be. On top of all that, I have now read that there is a conflict ofinterest from the minister of the environment: As Ecojustice wrote on behalf of Friends of theNorthumberland Strait, the minister has a clear financial interest in making sure theenvironmental assessment process is over and done with as quickly as possible. Our clientsalso say the minister\u00e2?Ts ongoing contracts with Northern Pulp give the impression that theminister is not able to make a fair decision about whether or not to approve the project. Theseconflicts of interest violate the public\u00e2?Ts right to a thorough and unbiased assessment. That iswhy we are calling on the minister to step away from the assessment process and make wayfor a federal environmental assessment.\u00e2? In summary, a federal assessment is required. Iwill accept the outcome of that but nothing less. Until then, NO EXTENTION, NO PIPE. Insummary the concerns that need to be addressed are: The waste proposal poses major risk toharming marine life, marine habitat, species at risk/endangered/threatened that includemigratory and marine birds, fish, vegetation, reptiles etc. All listed in the submissions viaNorthern Pulp. The proposal goes through the Pictou town and Caribou water supply. 2provincial parks and 2 nature preserves are within the effluent pipe footprint Meeting PPERdoesn\u00e2?Tt prevent harm to marine life or marine habitat per Environment Canada Thecharacteristics of the proposed effluent is \u00e2?ounknown\u00e2? to NP The proposal shows the planto burn the toxic sludge in the power boiler and air emissions are already an issue today. Thespill basin only holds 35 million litres of untreated effluent 10-12 hrs before it goes into theAST system. If a malfunction happens where does it go? They also list temporary andpermanent closures for fishermen around the outflow area, creating a no anchor zone andpossible compensation that has not been discussed for impacted fishers.

Sincerely, From: @smu.ca To: Environment Assessment Web Account Subject: Proposed Project Date: February 17, 2019 11:19:57 AM Project: replacement_effluent_treatment_facility_project Comments: This project is potentially disasterous from a number of perspectives. As a landowner on Caribou Island, I amconcerned for the water quality in the small harbour on the south side of the island, which haslimited capacity to flush out hazardous material, which is likely to concentrate in this areawhere my small children swim. On the larger scale, the effluent will raise water temperatureand the chemical composition of the Strait which is likely to have disasterous effects onmarine life and threaten the livelihoods of the large number of individuals engaged infisheries, which will be much worse than the loss of some mill jobs. Our province should bethinking forward and striving for innovative and sustainable solutions for our economy andenvironment. Supporting this disasterous mill project, which has cost the province millions,destroyed Boat Harbour, and is probably at least partly responsible for higher than averagecancer rates, is not the way forward. Who knows what additional damage the proposedeffluent pipe will do, and once the damage is done, it is often irremidiable. Why gamble onour childrens future?

The people of Pictou Landing First Nations are victims ofenvironmental racism at the hands of their own provincial government and a foreign ownedpulp and paper mill. Northern Pulp wants to dump billions of liters of treated effluent that willcorrode metal pipes, into the delicate eco-sytem of the Morthumberland strait. I do not wantthe mill to continue operations in any way shape or form because there is not 100 percentguarantee that the effluent will not create a dead zone in the waters and it has not been dis-proven that the mill emissions are not responsible for the high rates of cancer and copd inPicou County and surrounding counties.As a measure of good faith and good corperatecitazenship, our provincial government needs to force the mill to be subjected to the moststringent and in depth environmental assessment that exists in Canada, because the citizens ofPictou county know tha mill has a lot to hid e and they would not volunteerily submit to themost rigorous scientific assessment. It is passed time that this archaic mill ceased its poisoningof these lands.

Be sure to submit your concerns online https://novascotia.ca/nse/ea/comments.aspSEE BELOW FOR INFO DIRECTLY FROM THEIR PROPOSAL Impact Evaluation/EffectsAssessment The potential environmental effects of the project and project activities on marinefish and fish habitat are assessed in the following section. Potential Effects Marine fish couldbe affected by activities and components of the project during the construction phase andoperation and maintenance phase. If unmitigated, these changes have the potential to changemarine fish populations and fish habitat e.g., adult fish, juveniles, eggs and larvae,invertebrates and marine plants through direct mortality or indirectly through alteration ordestruction of habitat. The environmental assessment of marine fish is focused on changes inmarine fish populations. For the purposes of this assessment, a change in marine fishpopulations includes any physical injury or mortality on fish attributable to the project, andany destruction or alteration of habitat from disturbance of the marine environment.Construction Phase During construction, marine fish may experience direct mortality orfunctional impairment resulting in eventual mortality. The placement of in-water infrastructurewould have a direct effect on sessile or slow-moving demersal fish and invertebrates as theywould be unlikely to avoid construction activities within the marine PFA and could experiencemortality as a result of smothering or crushing. The construction of marine-basedinfrastructure may affect marine fish populations through a change in available substrate andsize distribution, a change in water and sediment quality, or changes to the acoustic qualitiesof the marine environment. The process of installing marine pipelines has a direct effect on thebenthic environment. In-water activities during the construction phase may also result in achange in sediment quality. The disturbance of marine sediments may temporarily increase theconcentration of TSS in the water column. Suspended solids can reduce feeding and growthrates and can alter migration of salmon in nearshore habitats Robinson and Cuthbert 1996.Reduced feeding rates, avoidance behaviour and suffocation due to effects on gill functionhave been observed in herring from suspended sediments Robinson and Cuthbert 1996. Theremay also be indirect effects on fish through alterations within localized food web structures.The severity of the effect of suspended sediments increases as a function of sedimentconcentration and duration of exposure Newcombe and Jensen 1996. During the constructionphase, vessel noise will be concentrated within the LAA and the majority of anthropogenicsound in the marine environment generated during construction will originate throughtrenching, pipe laying, and backfilling. There is also the potential for underwater sound ifblasting is used during the construction phase. Some marine fish species may be affected whenexposed to high intensity sounds Popper 2003. The sound emitted to the marine environmentduring the construction phase could therefore temporarily reduce the quality of fish habitat inthe marine PFA. Operation and Maintenance Phase Potential effects on marine fish and fishhabitat during pipeline operation include the discharge of treated effluent from the ETF. Thesepotential effects could result from: an increase in temperature, nutrients nitrogen andphosphorus, or TSS a change in colour, chemical and biochemical oxygen demand, dissolvedoxygen DO, or pH or a reduction in salinity from the discharge of treated freshwater effluentinto the Northumberland Strait. Lobster harvesters in the Pictou region have expressed concern about the potential effects of the discharge of treated effluent on lobsters, particularly in the larval stage. Potential effects to fish during the construction phase may also be applicable during the operation and maintenance phase if project maintenance activitiesrequire the presence and operation of project vessels or equipment, and in-water activities thatinclude seabed disturbance e.g., for pipeline retrieval Name: @sympatico.ca @eastlink.ca Assessment Web Account Subject: Proposed Project Date: February 17, 2019 11:38:14 PM Project: replacement_effluent_treatment_facility_project Comments: Dear Sir/Madam, Thank you for the opportunity to offer input on this proposed pipe project. As a former resident ofPictou, and frequent visitor to the town, I have a strong objection to the pipe going into theNorthumberland Strait at any point, let alone near the PEI ferry terminal. This company and itsmany previous owners have a very poor environmental track record, and for it to go throughthe Pictou watershed is just a very dangerous plan in my opinion. I do not think that there isany safe way to dispose of their effluent at all. Boat Harbour is an environmental disaster, andpumping the same effluent, although supposedly filtered, is just not good for our environment,our fishery, our tourism, nor our health. I ask that you please do not approve the proposed pipeif it includes going into any of our waterways. Thank you for your consideration.

In fact, your responsibility is to all Canadians, for we all share inthe consequences of every decision of this nature. It is appalling that Northern Pulp and theNova Scotia government have already spent years polluting the waters of NorthumberlandStrait and ignoring the rights and legitimate concerns of the Pictou Landing First Nation andof other local residents, particularly fish harvesters and people involved in tourism. Theconcerns about this new proposal are multiple, serious and urgent, as the proposal and thecontinued delays in promised remedial action pose huge further risks to the environment,public health, and society. They have been fully documented and detailed repeatedly by thePictou Landing First Nation, by the Northumberland Strait Sportfishing Association andothers. Please refer to their submissions, which I support, implement Assessment Web Account Subject: Proposed Project Date: February 18, 2019 11:55:17 AM Project: replacement_effluent_treatment_facility_project Comments: Im a Nova Scotia resident, married into a family with long term ties to Caribou Island. Im a zooplanktonecologist by training, and did most of my Ph.D work on zooplankton ecology in estuarinesystems. Ive read through the Environmental Assessment, focusing on the sections where Ihave relevant education and work experience, and have a few comments and questions that Ibelieve warrant some further focus. The project proposes to release the effluent at a depth of~20 m. The Registration Document Section 8.11.2.2 states that the in situ salinities are above~28 PSU, with temperatures varying over the annual cycle, from below 0\u00c2\u00ba to 3\u00c2\u00baC in thecoldest period to average temperatures of 17-18 \u00c2\u00baC during the warmest periods. The effluentis warmer 25-37 \u00c2\u00baC and less saline ~4 PSU than the ambient conditions throughout the year,and will therefore have less density. As a consequence, the effluent and mixing products ofeffluent and seawater will rise toward the surface until the density of the mixing productequals ambient densities at that depth. Subduction of fresh water is used in other parts of theworld to effect transportation of nutrients from depth toward the surface in vertically stratifiedsystems. Vertical stratification in the Northumberland Strait seems weak based on resultspresented, so the vertical advection set up by the diffuser system will probably have marginaleffects in terms of transport of naturally occuring nutrients. It will however very likely lead toan efficient mixing of the effluent with seawater, at higher dilution ratios than used in thecalculations below in to order to bring mixing product densities in line with natural densities,the numbers used in the circulation calculations below are therefore conservative. In AppendixE1, p. 16, it is explicitly stated that their baseline water quality, taken from the Pictou Roadlocation, is expected to be \u00e2?oworse off\u00e2? than the actual conditions in Pictou Harbour, yet thereport uses these same values in estimating dilution ratios to background values p. 24. This ismisleading at best i.e. elevated baseline, implying that the calculated dilution ratios of thewater quality parameters are \u00e2?obest case\u00e2? scenario values. I also have a question regardinghow the dilution ratios were calculated. On page 25 it is stated that the ambient salinity is 28PSU, vs an effluent salinity of 4 PSU, and that a dilution ratio of 7 is needed to reachbackground levels of salinity. 7 is indeed the ratio between the effluent and ambientconcentrations, but this number has little relevance for when the mixing product reachesambient concentrations. 1 m3 of effluent contains 4 kg of salts/TDS, the content of 7 m3 ofseawater is 7*28 kg. The total content of sa lts in 8 m3 of mixing product is therefore 200 kgof salts/TDS, or a salinity of 25 PSU. This is ~11 lower than the seawater, to reach 5 ofseawater salinity a dilution ratio of 16 is needed, to reach within 1 of seawater a dilution ratioof 85 is needed. The QA section in Appendix E2 shows the correct formula for calculations, sowhy are not the correct dilution ratios applied in this section in Appendix E1? In order todilute the effluent to the design aim dilution ratio 144:1, Section 5.2.4, a daily average of 9158 400 m3 of \u00e2?odilutant\u00e2? e.g. seawater is needed e.g. 144x average discharge, 63 600 m3,Table 5.2.1, with 12 240 000 m3 needed daily at maximum discharge 144 x 85 000 m3. Ifdilution is to occur, this consitutes an average inflow to the effective dilution area of 106 m3 s-1 maximum ~141 m3 s-1. To put that in perpective, the annual average discharge rate of theSt. Marys river in Nova Scotia is 45.6 m3 s-1, the St. Johns River in New Brunswick ~ 990m3 s-1 Source Wikipedia. D., Devine, L., andLafleur, C. 2017. Physical Oceanographic Conditions in the Gulf of St. Lawrence in 2016.DFO Can. Sci. Advis. Sec. Res. Doc. 2017/044. v 91 p., the monthly averaged flows through the Northumberland Strait NS varies over the year, with absolute monthly magnitudes spanning 300 to 7000 m3 s-1, and reversals in direction i.e. general direction westward rather than eastward in some months Galbraith et al. 2017, Fig. 67-70. Compared to the most of theother parts of the GSL, long term averaged current speeds in the vicinity of the effluent outletare rather low. Im a biologist, not an oceanographer, but based on these numbers andbackground circulation information I have at least 2 concerns about the pipeline: 1. Will theeffluent diffuser set up a new circulation pattern e.g. estuarine circulation that will affect thecurrent flow through the Northumberland Strait? Especially during months of low averageflow through NS the necessary inflow to the diffuser is a high proportion of monthly averageflow for NS as a whole, suggesting that the diffuser may potentially have a significant effecton larger scale circulation patterns. Has there been any assessment of the effects of the diffuseron the current field outside of the immediate vicinity of the diffuser? What magnitudes ofchanges in the present average current field is expected in the wider Northumberland Strait? 2.What is the hydraulical residence time of water parcels once they enter the NorthumberlandStrait, both under existing and modified e.g. post pipeline hydrographic regimes? In otherwords, will the effluent be diluted by \u00e2?ofresh\u00e2? seawater, or will the water in theNorthumberland Strait slosh back and forth with the tides, leading to effluent mainly beingdiluted by already diluted effluent? While the numbers given in Fig. 70 in Galbraith et al. 2017suggest a reasonable flow through the Northumberland Strait under the present hydrographicregime, the 3-month current vectors in Fig. 67 and 68 suggests sluggish water exchange.According to the documents provided, a dilution factor of ~100 is expected to be reachedwithin 20 meters Table 6.7-1, p. 115. Into this diffusion area an average inflow of ~73 m3 s-1100 x 63 600 m3/ 86 400 s would be needed to reach the stated dilution factor, and anaverage outflow of ~74 m3 s-1 101 x 63 600 m3/ 86 400 s would be produced. If the diffuserpipe is 50 m long, and we add a perimeter of 20 m around it, the resulting surface projectedcircumference around the 100:1 diffusion area is about 226 m. I do not have access to detailedbathymetry, but assuming an average depth of 20 m for this circumference, the area throughwhich both out and inflows would have to pass is at most 4512 m2. If one assumes that halfthis area is taken by the inflow, and half by the outflow, vertically averaged current speeds setup by the dilution process would be on the order of 3.2 cm s-1 at the 100:1 perimeter in thecase of isotropic in/out-flow. due to the topography surroun ding the diffuser area,anisotropy in the directions of the in- and outflows can be expected, so this is a lower boundestimate, and real current speeds set up by the diffusors are likely to be much higher. Fororganisms with pelagic larvae meroplankton, such as bivalves and crustaceans, the currentsand circulation patterns set up by the diffuser may lead to local changes in recruitment patternse.g. where will larvae be transported, where is the source of dilutant water. Also fish withpelagic larvae for instance herring may be affected by changes in the current fields may affectlocal transport/retention and also turbulence levels, which affect encounter rates between preyand predators. In order to assess potential ecological effects knowledge of current patterns fora larger region both prior to and after disturbance are needed. Apart from listing several areassome distance away from the diffusor as areas important to meroplankton, as far as I can seeno \u00e2?osupply-side ecology\u00e2? has been evaluated in the environmental assessment, eventhough recruitment ecology usually has a central position in most marine stock assessments. 3.What is downstream, i.e what is the position of the expected plume of diluted effluent? 4.What is upstream, i.e. where will the water that dilutes the effluent come from? 5. Do eitherdown- or upstream coincide with fish spawning grounds or shellfish banks? While the levelsof nutrients e.g P N added by the effluent are relatively small, the effluent has a relatively highchemical oxygen demand. The ratio of COD to BOD suggests that a fairly high proportion ofthe COD is non-biodegradable. 6. What type of material is it that makes up this COD? Is itdissolved, particulate or colloidal? Is it totally non-biodegradable, or just very slow todecompose? 7. If COD matter is particulate, what is its density, and it it prone to flocculation? I.e., can we expect it to either settle to the bottom or accumulate at the surface. 8. If particulate or colloidal, is it of a size fraction that can be expected to enter the food-chain, i.e. will itpotentially be taken up by filter-feeding animals such as bivalves and plankton? If taken up, isbioaccumulation likely? 9. What is the modelled overlap of the effluent plume withcommercially harvested shellfish banks? I assume that being directly downstream of thediffuser may reduce commercial value of shellfish attractiveness to consumers. 10. Based onBOD, currents, modelled effluent plume and bathymetry, what are the probabilities offormation of low oxygen zones dead-zones downstream of the diffuser? While theEnvironmental Assessment covers a lot of ground and is very voluminous, it seems to me thatthe potential for effects beyond a very localized area have been largely omitted in the analysis.Overall the zone of influence of the diffusor used in the environmental assessment seems veryrestricted, at least when looking at ecological rather than physiological effects. To me thatseems like a glaring omission in what actually constitutes a large-scale natural experiment.Looking at this from the outside, I would also encourage more inclusion of Nova Scotiasexcellent marine research institutions, so that they can evaluate and report back on what mayeither be a triumph of environmental engineering, or a tragedy of the commons.

I fish lobster, rock crab, herring and scallops. This is my comment concerning the effects of the pipe on our fishery. Caribou Harbour is one of the largest rock crab nurseries in the Eastern Gulf, containing millions of female and juvenile crab. The survival of the lobster industry in this end of the Northumberland Strait depends on the health of this rock crab nursery. Crab is the main foodsupply for lobster. Northern Pulp's plan to excavate a trench through the centre of this very special eco-system may spell the end of the lobster fishery in this area.

You will see 23,000 signatures from people all over NS, the Maritimes, the rest of Canada, and the World. You will see 55 pages of comments that people took the time to leave to express their concerns towards a toxiceffluent pipe into the Northumberland Strait. After reviewing all of the signatures, comments and where people reside, the message is very clear. Our reputation of warm clean ocean water and sandy beaches and our world renown seafood is at risk on THE WORLD STAGE! We DO NOT want our reputation changing to polluted oceans and beaches and contaminated seafood. The economic fall out would be catastrophic. Sincerely, Recipient : Minister Environment of Nova Scotia , Minister McKenna, Jonathan Wilkinson Letter : Greetings , Minister Miller , Minister Wilkinson and Minister McKenna, Today we have dozens of rivers that dump into the Northumberland Strait not counting tributaries . The Strait is a main passage for our a lot of marine species including Waterfowl. It is a place for them to feed , rest and live. However all this is at major risk with the proposed 90 million litres of euent to be pumped into the Strait a day. The euent at the outflow of the pipe is going to come out at 25c in the Winter and 37 c in the summer !! (The natural water temps of the Strait reaches 15C in the summer ) These temps will absolutely change the diversity and make up of this sensitive and important marine ecosystem. This will increase the overall temperatures of the Strait over time due to the high volume of euent being pumped a day. The Euent is going to be fresh water . The Strait is comprised of salt water and species that require a specic level of salinity . At a rate of 70-90 Million litres a day , the salinity of the Strait will change as the waste continues to accumulate over time . This will impact Wetlands, all species that use the Strait as well as the food sources within. The makeup of the toxic chemicals that will be part of the euent will also pose major threat to marine life . The communications ocer for Northern Pulp has said a few times that the current infrastructure of the mill cannot handle the new proposed euent makeup because it will be to corrosive to their internal setup and that pumping it into the Strait is the most economical option for the Mill. However, there are many scientic documents that show the risk and harm that will come from this . Furthermore , the euent would contain chlorines, dioxins, metals , among other toxic constituents and will contain 935kg of solid materials per day . All of these can bioaccumulate, having catastrophic effects on marine life. Laboratory studies using individual chlorinated organic compounds that are commonly discharged from bleached pulp mills have demonstrated effects such as deformities, as well as embryonic and larval mortalities in sh. These chronic effects will jeopardize the future of many sh species and damage the integrity of the ecosystem . It is documented that Dioxins contaminate sh and shellsh because sh act like sponges for Dioxins,accumulating them at 25,000-50,000 times the concentrations present in their environment. It also is reported that sh species 250 miles away from the source have been impacted. The other obvious threat to the Strait is the colour of the water will change. The euent due to its makeup will change the colour at the water at the outflow of the pipe which is positioned a few kms offshore and directly into the Strait . At millions of litres a day , this will impact a very large area and ultimately change the natural state of the ecosystem. The Strait already has several large dead zones due to nutrient overloading from many sources . It cannot handle any additional pressures. Boat Harbour, once a very healthy estuary and wetlands is an ocial environmental disaster due to the mills current waste process . The NS Government is mandating that it be stopped by 2020 and cleaned up. However , the option Northern Pulp came up with is to dump it into the Northumberland Strait ! We need Federal involvement and a full Environmental Assessment completed to ensure that the proper scientic testing is done and risks highlighted. These are only a few points of a concern from a very long list that this pipe will cause . Our wetlands and surrounding marine habitat are not the only things at risk here . Atlantic Salmon, Trout , Herring, Gasperaux , Tuna , Mackerel, Striped Bass , etc etc etc all will be impacted by high water temps, toxic chemicals , changes in salinty and water clarity .

North Sydney , Canada2018-04-15 Our provincial govt has shown time and time again that they can 't handle projects at this size appropriately. They allowed Northern Pulp , who is only tested 4 times a year , to exceed emissions for about 4 years because they were 'working towards compliance '. Northern Pulp used that time to set production records instead of reducing their emissions . When the original 'world class treatment facility ' was built , they noticed how horribly bad it was after two days after it killed all of the sh and became the worst case of environmental racism in the province. That was 51 years ago and still won 't close for another 2 years . If that pipe goes in , I'm sure the same logic will be in place that if we notice that it is a mistake , even after 2 days , we will likely see that pipe continue for 50 years . And if the company has something go on that they need to x that makes things worse while they ' work towards compliance ', I'm sure they 'll take that opportunity to break production records over showing any concern Pictou , Canada 2018-04-15 I live on this Strait .

They take the environmental high road when it comes to pipelines to transport our petroleum products and they impose carbon taxes to try to save the planet from climate change which has been occurring since the beginning of time and then Liberal Environment Minister under Chretien admitted that the science concerning climate change was phony . This is proof that these people can care less about the environment . The strongest opponents to the Trans Mountain Pipeline expansion , when they are in the BC capital , poop directly in the Pacic Ocean as Victoria does not treat it's sewage. These same goons just raised their carbon tax , yet many oppose a sewage treatment plant . And Montreal has dumped raw sewage in the St. Lawrence when opposing the Energy East pipeline.

Belfast , Canada 2019-02-18 the strait is critical Charlottetown , Canada2019-02-18 Water and marine life are important . Montague , Canada 2019-02-18 I love the waters of Northumberland Strait and this makes no sense . Recipient : Minister Environment of Nova Scotia , Minister McKenna, Jonathan Wilkinson Letter : Greetings , Minister Miller , Minister Wilkinson and Minister McKenna, Today we have dozens of rivers that dump into the Northumberland Strait not counting tributaries . The Strait is a main passage for our a lot of marine species including Waterfowl. It is a place for them to feed , rest and live. However all this is at major risk with the proposed 90 million litres of euent to be pumped into the Strait a day. The euent at the outflow of the pipe is going to come out at 25c in the Winter and 37 c in the summer !! (The natural water temps of the Strait reaches 15C in the summer ) These temps will absolutely change the diversity and make up of this sensitive and important marine ecosystem. This will increase the overall temperatures of the Strait over time due to the high volume of euent being pumped a day. The Euent is going to be fresh water . The Strait is comprised of salt water and species that require a specic level of salinity . At a rate of 70-90 Million litres a day , the salinity of the Strait will change as the waste continues to accumulate over time . This will impact Wetlands, all species that use the Strait as well as the food sources within. The makeup of the toxic chemicals that will be part of the euent will also pose major threat to marine life . The communications ocer for Northern Pulp has said a few times that the current infrastructure of the mill cannot handle the new proposed euent makeup because it will be to corrosive to their internal setup and that pumping it into the Strait is the most economical option for the Mill. However, there are many scientic documents that show the risk and harm that will come from this . Furthermore , the euent would contain chlorines, dioxins, metals , among other toxic constituents and will contain 935kg of solid materials per day . All of these can bioaccumulate, having catastrophic effects on marine life. Laboratory studies using individual chlorinated organic compounds that are commonly discharged from bleached pulp mills have demonstrated effects such as deformities, as well as embryonic and larval mortalities in sh. These chronic effects will jeopardize the future of many sh species and damage the integrity of the ecosystem . It is documented that Dioxins contaminate sh and shellsh because sh act like sponges for Dioxins,accumulating them at 25,000-50,000 times the concentrations present in their environment. It also is reported that sh species 250 miles away from the source have been impacted. The other obvious threat to the Strait is the colour of the water will change. The euent due to its makeup will change the colour at the water at the outflow of the pipe which is positioned a few kms offshore and directly into the Strait . At millions of litres a day , this will impact a very large area and ultimately change the natural state of the ecosystem. The Strait already has several large dead zones due to nutrient overloading from many sources . It cannot handle any additional pressures. Boat Harbour, once a very healthy estuary and wetlands is an ocial environmental disaster due to the mills current waste process . The NS Government is mandating that it be stopped by 2020 and cleaned up. However , the option Northern Pulp came up with is to dump it into the Northumberland Strait ! We need Federal involvement and a full Environmental Assessment completed to ensure that the proper scientic testing is done and risks highlighted. These are only a few points of a concern from a very long list that this pipe will cause . Our wetlands and surrounding marine habitat are not the only things at risk here . Atlantic Salmon, Trout , Herring, Gasperaux , Tuna , Mackerel, Striped Bass , etc etc etc all will be impacted by high water temps, toxic chemicals , changes in salinty and water clarity .

Comments: As a former resident of the Town of Pictou, I agree that the Mill has provided jobs over the past years. However, thatis the past. My understanding is the number of actual people employed on site is around 100.The other jobs relate to the foresty industry. I think it is time to take a step back and find othermarkets for the wood harvests. The Mill has been polluting Boat Harbour since inception,never mind polluting the air that residents breath. The promise to close Boat Harbour MUSTBE KEPT, but UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES should treated waste be dumped intoNorthumberland Strait. It would be a travesty, not just for N.S., but for PEI, Assessment Web Account Subject: Proposed Project Date: February 20, 2019 9:56:00 AM Project: replacement_effluent_treatment_facility_project Comments: I believe the existing science and extensive studies on effluent will show it has done little harm to the environment.A balance between the environment and good jobs has to be found we dont need another 1000Nova Scotians heading west for work!!! Boat Harbour has drained into the NorthumberlandStrait for 51yrs and has not harmed the fishery. I strongly believe a modern new effluenttreatment plant will be a great improvement for the area and allow the Open Septic tank ofboat harbor to close even if a one year extension is required. Further to this all effluent leavingNP will now be treated preventing any future risk of a spill!!! Lets keep good jobs in ourForests industry! Thank you Email: 72 From: Environment To: Environment Assessment Web Account Subject: Proposed Project Comments Date: February 20, 2019 10:05:25 AM Project: replacement_effluent_treatment_facility_project Comments: I am from a home town that lost their main industry the little now village of Canso, we died after that, if thisassessment is not approved and if the plant is not given an extension even 6 months morewould make a big difference, I see the future of Pictou where Canso is now essentially nonexistent. Keep in mind the people complaining majority are retired so they don\u00e2?Tt have toworry about staying at home and when discussed with them their response is well the youthwill have to go elsewhere to work no regard for us . We want to stay home our families wantto. Northern pulp helps families multiple at Christmas I mean multiple disadvantaged families, I have yet to see a fisherman come in to pay for Christmas for a local family. Do not kidyourself they put on poor face but they are millionaires whom are self employed yet get EI inthe off season . No one else self employed gets this . It\u00e2?Ts time people see this for what it is acompany trying to right it\u00e2?Ts wr ongs and to save a county. If it is not given the time saygoodbye to multiple businesses and to the county in general.

Our comments are intended to help you decide if Northern Pulp's proposal warrants Environmental Assessment due to the possible adverse environmental effects on the region, and to determine if those effects can be mitigated, eliminated, reduced or controlled. Addressing directly adverse effects on the environment, the damaging effects of the effluent on Boat Harbour has been very clear. The current proposal of Northern Pulp to move their dumping from that harbour to Caribou Harbour does not in any way reassure us and other citizens of Pictou area that these damaging effects will not occur again. One of the most reliable scientific studies that can be pointed to is the direct results of past actions. The results of pouring pulp effluent into Boat Harbor has tragically harmed that environment and the health and economy of the people living in that environment. The trauma of living by waters that are polluted is evident and long-standing. This evidence alone points to what would be the future of Caribou Harbour and the citizens of our local region should this proposal go ahead as planned. We are writing to be clear that we do not want a repeat of a situation that would cause obvious damage to the environment, the local economy and the people's enjoyment of that environment. We live directly on Caribou Harbor and participate daily in the enjoyment of its clean, so far, environment, side by side with the lobster fisheries and tourism industries that are based in these waters. In our community, for instance, there is are two wharves from where fisherman operate their boats. We have first-hand relationships with them as our neighbours and as part of our local economy. We also live next to a Provincial Park, and the highly popular Pictou Lodge. Personally, we have been living on this shore for the last 30 years. In the summer we swim in the ocean on a daily basis, and since moving to Caribou Harbour, also enjoy daily walks along the shoreline to Munroe Island. We live next to the Caribou Provincial Park, which would be negatively affected by the dumping of effluent in these waters. This park is one of the most popular in the province, and attracts people from all over the Maritimes, and the country, as well as international visitors. If you have ever visited here to see the beautiful beach and what this area offers, what I am saying would be clear to you. Besides the local environment and economy, clearly our property values would decrease significantly if we lived on polluted water. What attracts people to live here is this beautiful, fresh, clean environment. Caribou Harbor is a sought-after area now, for these reasons. It is clear that this would change very quickly with the sheer volume of effluent being proposed to be dumped in our water, let alone its toxicity levels. The current proposal for cleanup of the effluent to make it less toxic does not reassure us that it would be sufficient to mitigate the problems we would be experiencing in the Caribou Harbour region. To this end we request that the Minister, whose job is to protect the environment and the citizens, order an Environmental Assessment Report. Based in a review of Northern Pulp's past actions and their detrimental effects to the environment and the people that live in the Boat Harbour environment, it seems clear and obvious that the Caribou Harbour environment and the people living here would also be directly affected if this plan went through, especially if done without the checkpoints and monitoring of an Environmental Assessment. Should there not be an Environmental Assessment, we submit to the Minister that from our point of view we, the public, would have every right and justification for suing our government for lack of protection of the environment and the people affected. Our hope is that our government will act responsibly and move in the direction of resolving this issue. Thank you for reviewing our submission.

Remember this is hometo one of the last remaining Atlantic Salmon populations. This pulp mill has been suckingtaxpayer dollars out of this province, poisoning the land and water of Indigenous communitiesand poisoning the air of everyone, for far too long. This new effluent treatment plan is nobetter than Boat Harbour, and simply shifts the burden of toxins to a different area. If the pulpmill cannot deal with its effluent internally with a closed-loop system, without foisting itspollution on the surrounding environment, it must be concluded that they are not equipped tofunction responsibly in our province. This effluent facility should not be approved. Name: Email: Environment Assessment Web Account Subject: End of Northern Pulp not the end of the world Date: February 20, 2019 11:48:33 AM Closing Northern Pulp would not be the end of the world. After all, in 2012 Bowater Mersey in Liverpool and Minas Basin Pulp and Power both closed, with a total loss of 455 jobs, yet Nova Scotia didn't fold.Indeed, there was at least one positive impact resulting from those closures; they reduced the demand forcoal-generated electricity and reduced Nova Scotia's GHG emissions significantly. The closing of Northern Pulp could have several positive effects on our province. First, our emissionsfrom coal-generated electricity would be further reduced; second, the air and water quality in the Pictouarea would be greatly improved; third, the threat to our fishery would be removed; and fourth, and mostimportantly, the loss of jobs in Pictou could lead to the development of many more jobs elsewhere in theprovince. If the province lifted the moratorium on hydraulic fracturing the harvesting of our onshore natural gas andthe building of pipelines to distribute it would create hundreds of jobs. It would also allow us to cut ourCO2 emissions from electricity generation in half and divert millions of dollars from South America wherewe purchase coal, to Cumberland and Colchester Counties where the bulk of our onshore natural gas isfound. Furthermore, it would deliver millions of dollars of income to the government; income that could beused to fund improved health care, education and infrastructure. It could also be used to lower businesstaxes and help grow our economy for years to come. The closure of Northern Pulp would not be the end of the world. In fact, it could be the beginning of abright new world for Nova Scotia.

Shut the ; Environment Assessment Web Account Subject: Northern pulp mill concerns Date: February 20, 2019 12:04:14 PM The Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency 1801 Hollis StreetHalifax, Nova Scotia B3J 3N4Telephone: 902-426-0564Email: ea@novascotia.ca Dear Minister of the Environment, I am writing to provide feedback to the Northern Pulp's 1200 page proposal to conduct a new effluent treatment facility at its Abercrombie Point location in respect to whether or not your department should recommend a federal environmental assessment. Taken from NP proposal: \"The proposed project will consist of building a new effluent treatment facility (ETF) on NPNS property including apipeline to transport treated effluent to Caribou Harbour. Ultimately, the effluent discharge will be into theNorthumberland Strait, as has been the case since 1967 via the existing facility. The installation of a modernengineered diffuser provides an improvement in effluent dispersion. The improvement is such that as unlike thevisual impact experienced today, it is anticipated that the effluent plume will not be visible when it reaches thewater's surface.\" This opening statement shows exactly how the rest of the document will read. NP calls it a \"new effluent treatment facility\" which in itself should trigger the federal assessment. NP then states that the effluent discharge will be into the Northumberland Strait as has been the case since 1967 via the existing facility. We have seen what that has done to Boat Harbour and the surrounding area so why is it o.k. to continue to pollute the Strait in an area where it will not be visible to the majority of the public. How many people other than fishers will be in boats 4 miles off the coastline? Does this make it o.k. to pump the effluent into the Strait because no one can see it happening or because it has been happening for the last 50 years as the proposal states? Just because the new diffuser will supposedly provide an improvement in effluent dispersion doesn't mean that it is better (see comments below) . What about the temperature difference of the effluent? According to NP the area affected will only be 100m from the discharge site. This is based on supposition not scientific fact and will have severe consequences to the fisheries (food over pulp please) for years to come. Potential environmental effects are identified and predicted for both the construction and the operation and maintenance phases of the project. The residual environmental effects of each project phase are evaluated as eithernot significant (\"NS\"), significant (\"S\"), with the likelihood of occurrence identified in such cases, or positive (\"P\").The environmental effects of accidents, malfunctions and unplanned events as well as cumulative environmentaleffects of the project in combination with other past, present, or reasonably foreseeable future projects or activitiesare also assessed. The table that is listed on page xxiv of the proposal summarized the studies, and the effect of the project for the significance of the project related residual environmental effects of the project. I was amazed to see that all categories were predicted as NS - No Significant Residual Environmental Effects Predicted. However, in reading further into the proposal I have discovered many other areas of concern. \"Detailed design has not been completed for the construction of the marine outfall and pipeline. The preferred method for trenching the marine pipeline will likely be by side-cast excavation methods with re-use of bottommaterials without bringing to surface\". And comments such as \"The treated effluent is anticipated to meetcompliance\"etc. are littered throughout the document. The whole document is written with \"not been completed\" or \"to be determined\". On numerous items the proposal states that it is not possible to know or needs more assessment due to the pipeline being defined in the fall of 2018. Again another reason for a federal assessment. Although NP has had 5 years to adjust to the new reality that Boat Harbour was closing, they have submitted a half- baked proposal, at the 11 hour with lots of what if and projections without any scientific data to back them up. Thisis not the fault of the population of Nova Scotia but we will have to suffer the costs both in air and water quality forNP dragging their feet and now trying to ram their proposal through. As one writer to the Herald stated \"If one lobster from the Northumberland Strait is found to be tainted with chemicals, it will not be recorded as a Northumberland Strait lobster, but a Maritime lobster. The whole Maritime fishing industry is at stake. The damage that NP has done to the forests of Nova Scotia should also be considered. The Lahey report summaries that there is and has been too much clear cutting in Nova Scotia and the health of the forest ecosystems and wildlife is declining as a result. Coupled with the spraying of Glyphosate (a herbicide that remains the world's most ubiquitous weed killer that has raised concerns regarding risk of cancer to those exposed toit by 41%,) the whole project should be studied from all sides and definitely in depth. A federal proposal is required.I understand that jobs are at stake here but there is more to consider than the economic benefit from one mill. There will always be a market for lumber and the independent foresters and the majority of Nova Scotians would like tosee changes to the clear cutting that NP has been getting away with for so long. There are other industries that are affected by NP destruction of the environment notably the fisheries (1 Billion) and tourism (2.7 billion). Together these two industries outstrip the benefits of NP. The health reasons of dumping 85,000 litres per day of a noxious mixture of dioxins, furans, metals and solids andother contaminates into a water source is inconceivable to me in this day and age of knowledge. Coupled with that, the mill wants to burn the sludge in the power boiler. This is the same boiler that has failed stack emissions tests (Northern Pulp's failed stack test happened the week of June 6 at a reading of 224, 50% over allowable levels)although I understand from NP proposal that \"A frequent exceedance is defined as one that occurs more than 1% ofthe time\". On page 140 under section 8.1.2.2 the proposal states that there have been no exceedances of maximum allowances. This is based on their own assessment. In the proposal NP quotes a recent paper by Hoffman et al. (2017) who evaluated ambient air levels of seven volatile organic compounds (VOCs), based on ambient monitoring data reported from the National Air Pollution Surveillance Network (NAPS). There are two NAPS monitoring stationsnear the NPNS mill that have historically monitored for VOCs. This paper focused on ambient monitoring data forthe perchloroethylene. The paper reported that results of the conducted temporal and spatial statistical analysesindicated that 1,3-butadiene, benzene, and carbon tetrachloride air concentrations routinely exceeded EPA air toxics-associated cancer risk thresholds, and that 1,3-butadiene and perchloroethylene levels in air were significantlyhigher when the prevailing wind direction blew from the northeast and the NPNS mill towards the Granton NAPSsite. Conversely, when prevailing winds originated from the southwest towards the mill, higher median VOC airtoxics concentrations at the NAPS site, except carbon tetrachloride, were not observed. These outcomes have notbeen corroborated by regulatory agencies or other parties at this time. While this study was quick to attributeelevated ambient VOC concentrations to the NPNS mill based on a spatial and temporal evaluation only (i.e., astatistical evaluation of ambient data in correlation with wind direction, without further site specific investigation), itdid not attempt to rule out contributions from other potential sources of VOCs in the area (e.g., transportationsources, or other industrial sources like the Michelin tire plant or the Trenton coal-fired power plant, presumably allsources of VOC emissions to some degree). So NP refuses to believe that they could be the source of air pollution but would prefer to blame it on other industries in the area. As far as the total environment foot print, meeting current PPE regulations does not mean that harm is not happening. Regulations for pulp mills were updated in 1992 and are concerned with biochemical demand and suspended solids. As it stands now, there are no CCME guidelines established for some of the different chemicals and compounds that make up the pulp mill effluent. It is not acceptable to follow 27 year old legislation so once again, a federal assessment should be considered. The new treatment facility is being touted as better than the old. I have several concerns and comments on this. It is my understanding that the current set up has the discharge going into the Northumberland Strait after a 12 hourprimary treatment in the settling ponds, then moves to an aeration basin where effluent is placed in contact with micro-organisms and sits there for 8 days after which the effluent is discharged into Boat Harbour lagoon (basin) where it remains for an additional 20-30 days. Further aeration, settling, cooling, volatilization and breakdown of materials take place during that time. In the proposed new Activated Sludge Treatment (AST) system on the millsite, effluent will move through a primary clarifier to an aeration basin using micro-organisms to break downpollutants, and then to a secondary clarifier. The process will take less than 24 hours. Northern Pulp states that effluent from the new system, including an added oxygen delignification system, will be similar to treated effluentleaving the present system at point C, with some (unspecified) reduction in biochemical oxygen demand (BOD.) However, the effluent being released from the proposed new system directly into the deep waters of the Strait willnot benefit from the considerable reduction in BOD, Total Suspended Solids (TSS) and other contaminantsincluding heavy metals which takes place during the 20-30 days that effluent presently remains in the Boat HarbourBasin stabilization lagoon. Northern Pulp has not provided a detailed comparison between the effluent whichpresently reaches the edge of the Strait and the effluent they propose to release into the fishing grounds with the new system. The present effluent outfall location at the shore edge does not disperse effluent in the Strait in thesame way that the proposed new outfall site would. With the proposed new system, 70+million litres of treatedeffluent would be pumped directly and continuously into the prime fishing areas of the Strait every day. Ocean environments are increasingly stressed. The Northumberland Strait Ecosystem Overview Report, prepared for DFO in 2007, documents increasing stresses on the Strait. To state that there are other industries producing stresses does not make it alright for NP to increase this toxicity and to think otherwise is just plain insanity. In terms of toxicity, my understanding is that there is only one test required to meet federal regulations. This test measures acute toxicity -- whether 50% of rainbow trout die when exposed to effluent for 96 hours. It does not measure impacts on fish growth or reproduction or on fish habitat. No toxicity test on salt water fish is required to meet federal regulations. There are no federal regulations for a number of known harmful substances in pulpeffluent, including AOX and phenols so further study is needed before this pipe is installed. We cannot wait for updated PPER legislation slated for publication in 2022. NP lists Alternatives Considered for Final Discharge Location or Method. Discharging into Pictou Harbour is not recommended due to the lack of mixing with the Strait (as if mixing with a larger body of water is acceptable), Release into the Middle River upstream was not considered due to expectations that it will increase chlorides in theMiddle River and potentially affect the maintenance of the equipment at the Middle River Pumping Station andinside the mill (but once again it is o.k. to dump on fishing grounds). The municipal stations and private facilities do not have the capabilities to handle the volume nor is a land based option available because as proposal states: Land application of wastewater effluent has not yet been approved in Nova Scotia (small wonders), Trucking or barging the sludge to a different location is not recommended. I found the barging comments interesting: A pier for barge loading would be necessary - assumed to not be at the NPNS mill location. Liquid would have to be eitherstored and trucked or stored and pumped to a facility to offload to an ocean going barge/tanker to be dischargedoutside of coastal waters in an approved area, with a large number of tankers. There would be increased industrialvessel movements in the NorthumberlandStrait, potentially disrupting fisheries. Project specific permits would be required as the effluent does not fall undermaterials permitted to dispose of offshore. NP is concerned about the increase in traffic in the Strait but not about the effluent that will be pumped there. Why would they need project specific permits if effluent does not fall under material permitted to dispose of offshore but using a pipeline to dump the effluent is allowed? A closed loop system is not economically viable according to Northern Pulp. NP also states: The main problems with the bleach plant effluent recovery are equipment corrosion and accumulation of chloride and non-process elements in the mill's water systems. Accumulation of chlorides and potassium are especially corrosive for themill's boilers and often lead to scale build-up which would require the replacement of the boiler over time. However NP also argues that it would not be economically viable for NP however they are quick to boast of theannual volume of income at $535 million. If the chemicals used are too corrosive for the river and too corrosive to recycle in their own equipment, how can pumping the effluent into the Northumberland Strait be a viable solution? Surely dispersing sludge over a larger area is not the answer. And what happens if NP sticks around until the end of the lease in 2030. Who is going to clean up the mess then? Who is going to compensate the fishing and tourist industry? This are too many other stakeholders involved to let this go through without a Federal Assessment. I haven't even commented on the state of the health industry in Nova Scotia that could use the money being spenton NP. NP has already received $127 million dollars in tax payer's dollars over the years. We have paid for the design process of the proposed effluent process at a cost of $6 million dollars and will be expected to cover the cost of the construction, installation, labour etc. for the proposed pipe estimated at $100 million dollars. How can NP be allowed to pollute the environment as they have in the past and how can we as citizens believe anything that NP putsout in the media about how wonderful they are when history has shown otherwise? I would rather put my tax dollars towards the penalty of breaking the lease if need be. On top of all that, I have now read that there is a conflict of interest from the minister of the environment: As Ecojustice wrote on behalf of Friends of the Northumberland Strait,\" the minister has a clear financial interest in making sure the environmental assessment process is over and done with as quickly as possible. Our clients also saythe minister's ongoing contracts with Northern Pulp give the impression that the minister is not able to make a fairdecision about whether or not to approve the project. These conflicts of interest violate the public's right to athorough and unbiased assessment. That is why we are calling on the minister to step away from the assessmentprocess and make way for a federal environmental assessment.\" In summary, a federal assessment is required. I will accept the outcome of that but nothing less.

I believe people and industrywould be willing to help fund the cleaner process. Of course the stake holders should carry thebulk of that expense. 3. Long term environmental impacts are not known therefore thequestion should not be considered answered appropriately by the applicant.

NO PIPEName: Assessment Web Account Subject: Proposed Project Date: February 21, 2019 7:39:19 AM Project: replacement_effluent_treatment_facility_project Comments: Dear Minister, Thank you from the opportunity to comment on Northern Pulp\u00e2?Ts environmental assessmentregistration document. I will preface my remarks by saying, I studied environmentalassessment many years ago at Dalhousie University that I have prepared an environmental assessment registration for a project in Nova Scotia, and I am alandscape architect with a background in beaches and shoreline processes. I understand thedifficult situation the Minister and the Province find themselves in with respect to closing BoatHarbour and the associated requirement for Northern Pulp to provide an acceptable alternativeeffluent treatment and disposal plan. I have visited Boat Harbour, and it is an environmentaldisaster with concentrations of chemicals in the bottom sediments. Hopefully it can beremediated successfully and the years of exposure that Pictou Landing First Nations had toendure must end. Any proposal that involves dumping millions of litres per day of a chemicalprocess effluent into the Northumberland Strait at Caribou Harbour requires carefulconsideration of the potential environmental impacts at source, at the outfall and downstream .The absolute minimum requirements to assess the potential impacts are : 1] A clearunderstanding of the chemical composition of the effluent , 2] The design of the outlet, 3 ]Good baseline information on the Northumberland Strait marine environment and processes, 4] A demonstrable appreciation of the risk factors at the outlet location such as sedimentmigration and wave energy. 5.] Consideration of the potential impacts of extreme storm orwave events generated in part by climate change. The Registration Document for NorthernPulp\u00e2?Ts proposed effluent treatment plan fails to provide critically important informationwhich is essential to proper environmental assessment. It states on page 502 \u00e2?othere ispresently uncertainty regarding the likely chemical composition and characterization of themarine effluent discharge \u00e2?o . It further admits in 9.2.4 that there are two sources ofchemicals of potential concern that may result in potential chronic human exposure to projectrelated chemicals. The potential impacts on the health of area residents must be known andproperly evaluated before approval of this project. The document states there is no detaileddesign available for the main effluent outlet, and that the proposal in the Registrationdocument was prepared without field work in the marine environment. There is no specificdiscussion or assessment of the potential impacts of climate change in the Registrationdocument. The environment of the proposed effluent outfall is a dynamic, shallow, drownedshoreline with sediment movement that is subject to periodic extreme storm events as lowpressure systems track into the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. The proposed effluent outfall locationis in close proximity to a site of ecological significance at Monroe\u00e2?Ts Island, an importantProvincial Campground and Day Use park at Caribou , and it sits at one of the key tourismentry points to Nova Scotia. The impacts of any potential catastrophic failure of the treatmentsystem would be amplified by this very public and ecologically sensitive location. Anymechanical system is potentially subject to failure and the impacts of such a potential failurecannot be adequately assessed without knowledge of the chemical composition and physicalcharacterization of the effluent. The deficiencies in the document raise serious concerns withrespect to its conclusions on the potential significant environmental effects on the valuedecosystem components. The conclusions indicate there will be no significant effects on allcomponents. I submit that without knowing what the effluent contains these conclusions arescientifically impossible. I understand the economic importance of Northern Pulp to NovaScotia and I sincerely hope that an environmentally acceptable alternative effluent treatment strategy can be developed that does not risk destroying one of Nova Scotia\u00e2?Ts most valued marine environments . However, given the serious information deficiencies and uncertainties in the Registration document it cannot be accepted and the project cannot be allowed toproceed until these deficiencies are addressed .

Im a certified Power Engineer, and I have had the privilege ofbeing employed by Northern Pulp for the last year working in my trade. Northern Pulp hasgiven me the opportunity to work and stay living in my home town and provide me with a wellpaying job. They have also invested time and money in allowing me to upgrade my licence.Before getting hired I would have had to move out of province to find employment becausethere simply isnt many other employers willing to hire unexperienced tradesmen in ourprovince. Many of my friends and classmates were not so lucky and had to move out ofprovince or are still unemployed. I have studied wastewater treatment plants with my tradeand I see absolute nothing wrong with the new proposed effluent treatment facility we plan tobuild, this is a more modern and up to date treatment facility then the current Boat Harbourplant. Northern Pulp has been working very hard to comply wi th all the environmentalregulations this project requires. I believe Northern Pulp should be given the opportunity toprove that this is a viable solution. I hope to continue working at Northern Pulp for many yearsto come, because Pictou County needs more employers like them and not fewer.

With so much having been said by so many, it is clear thatall sides to this challenge have dug in or are committed to one side or the other. I find thisdisturbing in that from the outset, the Government of the day had signed a deal with NorthernPulp to allow their management and operation through 2030 [nobody is remembering that] andwhile I certainly acknowledge the negative implications thereof to the environment in terms ofthe evolving Boat Harbour situation, I am embarrassed as a Nova Scotian that cooler headshave not prevailed and efforts to mitigate this huge challenge with a comprehensive s olutionhave been reduced to name calling, anger and related non-productive actions where the focusshould and needs to be on solving the problem, which NP is undertaking to do, seeminglyagainst all odds. Why do we not get as passionate about focusing on a solution to, for and withour valued corporate operators that we encouraged and brought here to operate, create wealth,jobs, opportunities and lifestyle instead of turning on them. No Corporation can fiscally plan,act and be responsible within an environment like this where the politics are undertaking toerase the agreements originally made with these people and disregard/change thoseagreements, seemingly for political gain and to win over people/votes. There has never been atime in our history where we have to step up, get behind those that helped create the verycommunities that will be destroyed with this business of taking sides. More than anytime inour history, we need decisive leadership, cool heads and a p lan to support the Corporation webrought here and then turned on when the going got tough. Lets become the Community thatfixes and supports these corporate leaders with solutions and then sell that ability andpositioning around the world, as this is not an isolated case in this industrial world, but achallenge for us to embrace and fix, not be seen as the political fairweather people that backaway from our own promises because we make statements at the Leadership level that thePoliticians are not prepared to mitigate and protect our own people, jobs, lives, families andthats all our people, not just catering to those whom will take every opportunity to gain theirown personal and selective objectives and agenda, whatever they/it may be. If we fix this andshow that kind of leadership, embrace the technology, get behind it and support our CorporatePartners who helped create our Communities, we will impress the world, and become who weneed to be to be a responsible an d proactive society that welcomes challenges, not shy awayfrom them and hide, when the going gets tough, for this will tell the world we are not aresponsible, professional and proactive society that are worthy of their or anyones trust towork together and back up our promises.

It should only be a level one assessment and not a level two- federal assessment forthe simple reason, it is, as the title states, a replacement effluent treatment facility, not a newone. 2. What Northern Pulp is requesting to do, is to do what they have been doing for the 50years, put treated effluent into Northumberland Strait. With the modern facility, and onlytreated effluent leaving the Northern Pulp site, it will be better than the existing site. Othermills and municipalities have been putting treated some municipalities un-treated effluent intothe ocean for decades. this is no different. 3. Any wrongs that has been done in the past, inregards to the Boat Harbour facility, cannot be changed it is history.

My name is and I have lived in the Pictou area for 35 years. I had a cottage in Caribou River for 31 years and now live in a waterfront ground level condo frighteningly close to the proposed pipeline route and effluent dumping site just off Caribou Point. Please reject Northern Pulp's proposal. I believe a long intense scrutiny and a full environmental assessment needs to be done...no matter how long it takes. I do not believe the process has been fair. The public has not had sufficient time to read their lengthy report and Northern Pulp has not offered information sessions on this report to the public . We only have 30 days to re- spond and Northern Pulp had 5 years to come up with their proposal. Northern Pulp has not identified what will be in their effluent so how can they know it will be safe? How can they realistically claim their effluent will have no environment effect 2 metres from the end of their pipe? They have not collected data from Caribou Harbour; they are using data they collected from Pictou Harbour. This is insufficient. The waters in the area have not been surveyed. The specific route of the pipeline is unknown. This project could put the Strait at risk for a long time. Harm will be caused constructing, using and decommissioning this project. Nort hern Pulp does not care about our environment; they do not care about the people in Pictou County and Nova Scotia. They only alter their equipment when required by the government. All they care about is money...what they can earn and how much they can get from the govern- ment to continue polluting the air we breathe. When I open my front door to walk my dogs and the winds come from the south, it stinks. A gift from the mill to the people. Please do not let them pollute our water. I am a graduate of three Nova Scotian Universities. I have worked as a teacher in this province and run a small business. I am not a scientist but I am an outdoor person who enjoys the ocean, beaches and woods. I have many years of experience with the environment, nature and health. I walk the beach every day for half the year, often to the end of Munroe's Island (a bird sanctu- ary). I swim in the waters here from the end of June until the end of September. It is a beautiful beach and area. My neighbour, Caribou Munroe's Island Provincial Park and Campground, teems with locals and tourists, campers from near and far. I have heard a number of people claim it is the nicest campground in the province. I believ e this shore of Nova Scotia is one of our province's hidden secrets. The waters and beaches are pristine. My children grew up summering on the shore, enjoying watching hermit crabs tickle their hands and crabs scurrying sideways before digging into the sandy bottom. I want my granddaughter and all the children yet to come to enjoy these wonders. The tides go in and the tides go out, bringing unexpected treas ures. I fear Northern Pulp's gar- bage washing up on our shores, day after day. This will endanger our waters and make it un- safe for life in both the sea and the area. One only has to look at the Boat Harbour mess. The First Nation's treasured water now only stinks and all sea life perished years ago after effluent was piped there. I would like to see our government make choices for the future of our environment. This would involve not supporting a polluting industry in an outdated facility. Please make choices that sup- port the people with a long term and sustainable future that doesn't destroy the unique gifts of this area and our health. Your job is to protect the environment and the citizens, now and into the future. Please act re- sponsibly. Reject Northern Pulp's proposal and ask for a full environment assessment. Thank you for reviewing my submission. Respectfully, From: To: Environment Assessment Web Account Subject: Feedback on Boat Harbour Date: February 22, 2019 12:41:41 PM I am writing out of concern of the health consequences to Nova Scotians. The composition of the toxic effluent will contain dioxins, furans, metals, solids and other contaminates at a rate of 90,000,000 Litres per day. Dioxins and furans can cause very serious health issues to humans and our food sources. Shellfish absorb dioxins and furans at 25,000-50,000 times the concentration in the water. The Northern Pulp treatment system proposal includes a plan to burn the waste sludge. The waste sludge contains toxins which would be released through the stacks of the mill's power boiler. The proposal is to \"dewater the sludge prior to mixing it with bark and other wood waste for combustion in the mill's power boiler.\" This is the same power boiler that is currently and repeatedly failing stack emissions tests. Problems with air quality from mill emissions have been documented for years. Lack of appropriate monitoring and enforcement already puts area residents at risk. Now, Northern Pulp is considering adding sludge containing toxins to the combustion mix, increasing health risks from NP's air emissions. It is also important to note, the route of this effluent pipe goes through the source water supply for the town of Pictou and community of Caribou and surrounding area. We should no longer be putting Nova Scotians' health and environment at risk.

Thatarea was inadequately addressed a few years ago with the air polution from the smoke stacksat the mill. Tourism was affected for many kilometres around the mill for many years. The airtreatment facility should have been addressed and fixed long before it affected the Touristtrade in the area. Now the proposed water effluent into the Northumberland Strait could affectthe quality of the water at the numerous beaches in the area as well. A much more thoroughstudy is required. Name: Assessment Web Account Subject: Proposed Project Date: February 22, 2019 2:55:16 PM Project: replacement_effluent_treatment_facility_project Comments: It is with great concern that I write this letter. The two most important points I must begin with are: my completedistrust of any information coming from Northern Pulp, as well as my uncertainty that thegovernment of NS will do what is morally right for the people of Pictou County. I have been aresident of Pictou County for 57 years therefore I have witnessed the entire history of the mill.I reside near Pictou and have suffered medically and mentally from the daily emissions whichrange from whitish to black, often times being unable to leave my home due to the potency ofthe emissions. I also have a summer home on the Northumberland Strait. It was here that I wasrelieved of the horrible air quality for several months of the year. Unbelievably, my severalmonths of reprieve are now threatened by the piping of effluent into the Strait. Evenconsidering a Level 1 assessment for this process is beyond my comprehension. I am not ascientist or an environmentalist, I am just a citizen of this province who pays taxes and electsgovernments to represent the best interests of the people. Having read every newspaper article,every document published by the mill, and attended every public meeting, it glaringly obviousthat this project requires a full Level 2 Federal Assessment. I recently read informationpublished by Northern Pulp indicating that they will not know the exact potency of theeffluent until the process begins. What!! The process can never begin without thatinformation. I spoke with a NP representative at the DeCoste Centre when CBC News wasthere. I asked him to address this issue and his answer was, \u00e2?oWell think of it like buying anew car. It\u00e2?Ts always going to be better than the old one.\u00e2? Seriously, I guess he thought Iwas an idiot. The number of unknowns is extremely concerning. We have a thriving fishingindustry in the exact location that the effluent will be dumped. Have all the questionsregarding water temperature, settlement of solids, toxicity been answered? Obviously not andthis is simply unacceptable. Will all the questions be answered by a provincial assessment?No! In conclusion Northern Pulp is not the first and will not be the last industry to close itsdoors in Pictou County. Hundreds of jobs have been lost before and government did not stepin and offer these businesses a hand-out. If the only solution to this issue is the closing of themill then so be it. The people and the environment have suffered long enough. I believe that afull federal assessment will discover that the option of pumping effluent into theNorthumberland Strait is simply not feasible. It is now 2019 and I hope we have progressedfar enough as a society to put an end to industries that get rich at the expense of theenvironment. Thank You, Name: Assessment Web Account Subject: Proposed Project Date: February 22, 2019 3:01:43 PM Project: replacement_effluent_treatment_facility_project Comments: Upon reviewing the proposed Effluent treatment facility project that Northern Pulp has proposed I have come tothe conclusion that I fully support this project for the sustainable future of many sectors withinNova Scotia. Being a province that already lacks diversity in the form of many industrialemployers we must not chase industry out of the province. I believe that the proposal indicatesthat they will be prudent and exercise due diligence at all times during the construction andoperation of the facility. I also believe the impact to the environment will be minimal, and ifany impacts are evident then they can easily be mitigated with no long term ill effects. Wemust look to other effective usages of this system in other parts of Canada to see that the threatis not valid to the environment and ecosystem.

Presently, there is no regulatory requirement to conduct a human health risk assessment (HHRA) study in associa tion with the NPNS project. The project is currently in a Class 1 EA Process in Nova Sco tia that does not specifically require the comple tion of a HHRA in advance of registra tion of an EA. Section 9-15 page 489 2. The HHE does not include quantitative exposure and risk analysis approaches at this time that would typically comprise the HHRA steps of exposure assessment, toxicity assessment and risk characterization. The HHE is not a HHRA, though it does necessarily comprise some elements of a HHRA, as noted above. EA. Section 9-15 page 489 3. Tasmania Pulp mill used for comparison for the Human Health Evaluation. The Tasmania pulp mill was assumed to process mainly hardwood eucalyptus chips. There is someuncertainty regarding how the wood chips processed at the NPNS mill, which are fromsoftwood coniferous species, would compare to eucalyptus chip processing, with respect topotential effluent chemistry differences. EA. Section 9-15 page 492 Tasmania has not undergone regulatory review by Health Canada The Tasmania mill did not open and faced many environmental challenges in court https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Bay_Pulp_Mill 4. Potential Risks Chemicals present in treated effluent that is released to the marine receivingenvironment may come into contact with human receptors in marine sea water orsediments. Some of the chemicals present in treated effluent may accumulate within certain marine food items that are harvested by local community members. Air emissions of certain contaminants to the atmosphere, during construction and operation (and maintenance) of the project, may present a potential inhalation exposure pathway for human receptors in communities located within the study area. As the current proposed pipeline route traverses a drinking water supply area, there is a potential that accidental releases from the effluent pipeline in this area (should theyoccur) could potentially impact potable water supplies. EA. Section 9-15 page 492 5. Only using these contaminates for their assessment. Carbon monoxide (CO). Hydrogen sulphide (H2S). Nitrogen dioxide (NO2). Sulphur dioxide (PM2.5). EA. Section 9-15 page 503 6. Downplaying the independent air quality study perform by Hoffman et al from Dal EA. Section 9-15 page 494 7. Due to uncertainty regarding effluent composition and approximate concentrations of substances present in the future treated effluent (which will not be verified until the projectis operational), the identified candidate COPCs in effluent are considered preliminary at this time. Refinement of the candidate COPCs would be anticipated for a potential HHRA study ofthe project, should one be required (wherein various screening approaches, as previouslydescribed above, would be applied to refine and reduce the candidate list of COPCs down toa more reasonable and representative set of COPCs). The same types of screening considerations apply to the potential assessment of impacted drinking water, in the event the effluent pipeline experiences accidental releases in the sections that traverse drinkingwater supply areas. Candidate COPCs in future treated effluent were determined primarily on the basis of: A review and synthesis of historical data and reports for areas near the NPNS project,particularly areas that are or were influenced by the NPNS mill current or historical effluentdischarges. The outcomes of the COPC identification processes that were applied in the Toxikos (2006)HHRA study. Selected additional relevant scientific literature. EA. Section 9-15 page 506 8.

Let our county flourishwithout this contamination of our fishery. We have lived 35 years in the stench of this mill.Put it somewhere else. Bedford Basin? Assessment Web Account Subject: Northern Pulp Date: February 22, 2019 10:17:54 PM Dear Sir or Madame: I grew up in Pictou County and return often to see my family. I also am a Nova Scotian livingalong its coast line, now in Cape Breton. I have followed the Northern Pulp debate closely and simply put, the proposed project is concerning. If hastily approved or approved under a short sighted approach or by those in aconflict of interest position, then the long term negative economic, environmental and potentialhealth impacts will be its legacy.This region's fisheries and tourism are key to its economic survival. A pipe with toxic effluentflowing through these same waters does not promote these industries. Further, the long termimpact of millions of litres of effluent a day going into the body of water, needs to be studiedand reviewed for impact on water quality, ocean biology impacts, breeding and health of the finfish and shellfish, human health including swimming and consumption of fish. This sameeffluent or slight variation thereof has made boat harbour a toxic site unable to support life.Surely, the days of \"it goes away\" and the ocean is large enough are over in 2019. We need to be able to trust our government will act in our best interest - on all fronts. This is not a partisan matter. This project is a one time shot, a legacy decision, that may determine the veryfuture of our fisheries, tourism, enjoyment of the waterways, health and our First Nations abilityto fulfill their treaty rights. The time required to do a proper federal or proper assessment cannot be grounds for dismissing or opposing this assessment. We deserve to be protected and have proper duediligence completed. After all, once the pipe is in, the ability to monitor and track its effluentstandards becomes difficult. The public lacks confidence those standards will be followed, giventhe company's public track record of environmental violations to date. We do not have theluxury of a simplistic or short sighted review, as too much is on the line and reversing the pipeimpact or even mitigating it may be impossible or take generations. An extensive review andstudy is required. Further, on its face Nova Scotia appears to be in a conflict of interest position; as such, aindependent authority such as the federal government is an appropriate to step to remove anyreal or perceived conflict and to ensure due diligence and objectivity. Regards, From: @hotmail.com To: Environment Assessment Web Account Subject: Proposed Project Date: February 22, 2019 10:38:22 PM Project: replacement_effluent_treatment_facility_project Comments: I am writing this in support of a Class 2 assessment and declining the Class 1, for this project. In fact, I believethere should be a Federal environmental assessment regarding this matter. Since NorthernPulp, itself, admits they do not know what the effluent will contain section 9, page 502, itwould be fool hardy to approve this project without a full and complete environmentalassessment. Name: Email: ; ceaa.boatharbour.acee@canada.ca Subject: Northern Pulp's replacement ETF Date: February 22, 2019 11:37:08 PM Dear Premier McNeil, Minister Miller and CEAA, I am writing in relation to Northern Pulp's Replacement Effluent Treatment Facility project. My name is and I live in Pictou County and have been following this issue very closely for a few years now. I would like to identify some uniquenesses about Northern Pulp, some differences between the current and proposed ETF along with some other concerns that Ifeel should be taken into consideration by you. A 2010 AMEC study presented to the Province of NS identified that Northern Pulp were in the 100th percentile when compared to other similar bleached kraft pulp mills in the country for:average flow rate (water usage), COD levels and colour of effluent. And since this study wascompleted Northern Pulp has not reduced their water usage, still use chlorine dioxide forbleaching and have made no known upgrades that would have improved effluent quality.Bleached kraft mills by nature are the worst polluters out of all the different types of pulpmills in the world. The production yield of a bleached kraft mill is approximately 50%meaning that half of the tree gets used for production and the other half ends up being releasedinto the waste stream. TMP mills like Port Hawkesbury Pulp & Paper have a production yieldcloser to 95% so 95% of the tree gets used and 5% ends up in the waste stream. Plus bleachedkraft pulping requires the use of chemicals to break down the lignin in the wood to make pulpand the use of chlorine dioxide to bleach with versus TMP mills that use thermal mechanicalenergy to make pulp and peroxide to whiten the product. So by nature, bleached kraft pulpmills are the worst polluters out of all the different pulping processes and Northern Pulp is inthe 100 percentile in Canada for water usage, COD levels and colour of effluent. They are theworst of the worst in Canada. According to the KSH Engineering's projections the new EFT system would be better thanNorthern Pulp's current system, approximately 20-60% better depending on which variableyou view. However, the receiving water now for the treated effluent is the Boat Harbour Basinand not the Northumberland Strait. After leaving the Boat Harbour Treatment Facility - atpoint C, the treated effluent is then released into the Boat Harbour Basin where it is retainedfor approximately 20-30 additional days. Point C is the federally regulated point. The newETF would release the treated effluent directly into the Northumberland Strait without theadded bonus of the 20-30 day retention time for additional cooling, dilution and settling in thelarge Boat Harbour Basin. The elimination of the Boat Harbour Basin is a huge factor because EEM data shows that the Basin has a large effect on effluent quality that is currently reachingthe saltwater. The receiving water for the treated effluent is at point C where it is released into the BoatHarbour Basin. Point D is where it leaves the Boat Harbour Basin at the opposite end andmeets the saltwater at the shoreline of Pictou Landing. EEM data from 2014 showed asignificant improvement in effluent quality between points C and D proving that the BoatHarbour Basin does have a positive affect on effluent quality. It shows an improvement in TSSof 77.6% to 80.8% during the months of October, November and December between points Cand D. And during that same period it showed that BOD levels were improved between 74.1% and 77.4% between points C and D. Strangely it showed that these numbers were worse at point D during the month of August. One industry professional that we spoke with speculated that there was either a problem with how the data was collected that month or thatsummertime pollen and dust could have settled on the surface of the Boat Harbour Basincontributing to the results measured. But regardless it is very clear that the elimination of theBasin would have a substantial and negative impact on the effluent quality reaching the Strait.Based on this data there is enough information to conclude that the new ETF would be worsethan the old facility because of the elimination of the Boat Harbour Basin. So Northern Pulp isproposing a newer system but a worse location for the receiving water. The elimination of theBoat Harbour Basin would result in more of the toxins reaching the Northumberland Strait. Many third party consultants have completed studies and documents for Northern Pulp and theProvince of NS including: R.V. Anderson, CBCL, Neil McCubbin, Stantec, AMEC plus aninternal audit conducted by their parent company. There are known problems internally atNorthern Pulp which are causing air emissions problems (i.e. the High Level Roof Vent that isidentified in NPulp's current Industrial Approval). Are other Canadian mills allowed to ventunfiltered pollution through high level roof vents? We are unaware of any other Canadianmills allowed this same privilege which is essential a way around the regulations for NorthernPulp given that that stack is not regulated. Northern Pulp's proposed ETF shows that much ofthe waste sludge would be burned in the power boiler. This is of great concern because thepower boiler has no precipitator and there have been several reports about non-functioningscrubbers. And there is no hourly or daily monitoring of the stacks at Northern Pulp, onlyquarterly self-reported results conducted by Stantec who are hired by Northern Pulp. Black liquor spills, sometimes referred to as process disturbances or process upsets have been documented by third party consultants as well. These events often result in raw untreatedeffluent being released from the mill. These statements come from a Neil McCubbin memo toNorthern Pulp dated April 6th 2015. \"A few other kraft mills operate with annual averageCOD discharges of 15 kg/ton, demonstrating this level is attainable, but not withoutconsiderable effort. I consider that oxygen delignification, improved brown stock washing andscreen-room closure, and substantially upgraded spill recovery systems for black liquor wouldbe required to attain such a COD discharge level in the NPNS mill.\" The report also states,\"The data in the AMEC report indicates that the sources of colour discharge are roughly onethird each for brown stock washer losses, bleach plant and spills. The sources of COD areprobably distributed similarly, except the condensates and causticising department willcontribute some COD. These latter two sources will contribute virtually nothing to the COD ofthe treated effluent since the substances in them are very efficiently oxidized in any kind ofbiological treatment system.\" \"COD from the bleach plant can be cut by about 40% byinstalling an oxygen delignification stage. This would leave the so called \"spills\", whichconsist of accidental losses, leaks, draining equipment for maintenance, operator errors, etc.Consideration of the variations in daily COD discharges suggests to me that there is room forfairly inexpensive and substantial improvement in this area. However, it must be recognizedthat while spills can be reduced, one can no more eliminate spills completely than one caneliminate traffic accidents.\" The Neil McCubbin memo also states, \"Replacing the ASB withan AST system would reduce COD discharges somewhat, probably by roughly 20%.However, the cost would be significant.\" Take away points from above paragraph; 1. There are three main sources of COD, divided evenly at NPNS; brown stock washer loses,bleach plant and spills. 2. An oxygen delignification system would only improve the COD level from the bleach plant by 40%. So that's 1/3 of 40% which equals 13.333%. At best an oxygen delignification would only reduce COD levels at NP by 13.3333 % 3. Northern Pulp would need substantial upgrades to obtain a COD discharge level thatmatches the level of other bleached kraft pulp mills. 4. The new AST system would likely only reduce COD levels by 20% compared to theircurrent ASB system. Again, it has been identified that Northern Pulp uses more water per ton of production thanany other pulp mill in Canada. The Province of NS is aware of this issue and NSE has listedwater use reduction requirements in Northern Pulp's current Industrial Approval. In an emailobtained through freedom of information the manager of Northern Pulp informed NSE inNovember 2017 that they will not be able to reduce their water usage moving forward with thenewly proposed ETF even though this was a requirement within the current IndustrialApproval. A study conducted by R.V. Anderson Associates studied Middle River where Northern Pulp draws its water from. \"The sustainable water withdrawal rate for the Granton water intake wasdetermined to be 1.10 m3/s (95,040 m3/day)\". \"The Middle River watershed has a drainagearea of 239 km2 at the water intake location in Granton.\" In an email to Nova ScotiaEnvironment from Northern Pulp dated November 3, 2017 it states, \"NPNS will achieve themaximum daily water consumption rate of 92,310 m3/day by the end of the current IA\". Andit goes on to say \"a future 2020 annual water withdrawal limit of 70,000 m3/day is now notrealistic or achievable.\" So Northern Pulp is using almost all of the water that is sustainable ina watershed area of 239 km2 and despite the requirements to reduce water usage to 70,000m3/day by 2020 they are telling Nova Scotia Environment that they will reach 92,310 m3/dayby the end of the current Industrial Approval. In the EA on page 33, Northern Pulp / via Stantec (who were hired by Northern Pulp) arebeing very critical of the \"Pilot study investigating ambient air toxics emissions near aCanadian kraft pulp and paper facility in Pictou County Nova Scotia\" but they are leaving outimportant details from the rest of the study. According to the data collected the prevailingwind direction more often blows toward the Town of Pictou than it does toward Grantonwhere the monitor was placed to collect the data for this study. The study concluded that \"themill is a likely contributor to increased concentrations\" and \"in addition, there are clearseasonal variations of meteorological conditions and VOC concentrations. Southwestprevailing winds blowing towards Pictou dominate during summer months, when peoplespend more time outdoors, and consequently are exposed to higher concentrations\". NorthernPulp is trying to claim that it's really not clear that they are the source of the high VOC levelsfound present in the air. Yet this is a scientific, peer-reviewed study and the fact that theauthors suggested that Northern Pulp is the likely source could also be taken that NP is indeedthe source if the rest of the study is considered in its entirety. Given that the cancer riskthresholds were exceeded and that the scientists recommended that more monitors be locatedin areas of higher population, wouldn't we be better served by listening to the science insteadof Northern Pulp / Stantec? With all the talk about \"listening to the science\" why doesNorthern Pulp put such an effort into trying to discredit the science. Science that isn'tapproved by Northern Pulp and their hired consultants does not make it non-science. So there are air emissions problems, black liquor spills at Northern Pulp and more water per ton of production being used at Northern Pulp when compared to other Canadian bleachedkraft mills. The mill is in need of significant updates internally before a treatment system dumping into the Northumberland Strait can be considered. This is a very complex issue and one that many including myself have been studying for years. I could send in a hundred pages of comments but I chose just a few things knowing others arecovering some of the other important points. Looking back I believe that we started our groupwith naive intentions. We were hopeful that the mill would clean up its act and that thegovernment would more strongly enforce existing regulations and perhaps tighten up some ofthe weaker ones that we have in Nova Scotia when compared to the other provinces withregards to pulp and paper effluent and air emissions. My brother and a group of us have madea real effort to become informed and stick to facts. We have been very fortunate that the issuehas attracted the attention and support of many local business people, doctors, scientists,lawyers and other concerned citizens along with three pulp and paper experts, including twoengineers, a wastewater treatment expert and former employees of Northern Pulp along withthird party consultant firms. One of our mill professionals has worked all over the world atmany different mills including some zero effluent mills. I'm just a folk-singer but thanks to allof the support from many industry professionals I have become very informed about this issueand at this point it's safe to say that I know more about pulp mills than folk music. During one government meeting it was said to us that \"your group is spreading misinformation and being far too emotional and there are crazy things being posted on your Facebook Group\".We were quick to respond that \"our group\" isn't all of the 5000 plus members on a FacebookGroup. The people who've joined the Facebook Group are every kind of person with everykind of opinion on both sides, from mild to extreme. In fact, many of the members includeforestry workers and mill workers too. It is social-media and you should think of it as a gianttown-hall discussion and not \"a group\". So to put it bluntly, it's not \"our group\" - but they areyour constituents. I'll conclude with a list of points in no particular order although the last one has been the fuel for me throughout my involvement with this issue:1. Northern Pulp's known and identified internal problems create a unique situation andbuilding a new ETF would not cure the internal problems at the mill.2. There is an active fishing industry in the Northumberland Strait that needs to be protected.3. Many of the air pollution issues have not been fixed at the mill despite requests by thecommunity and NSE for Northern Pulp to move forward.4. Northern Pulp uses more water per ton of production than any other mill in the country anddraws upwards of 92 million litres per day from a river that drains an area of 239 square kmsand has a sustained recovery rate of only 95 million litres per day. So Northern Pulp is usingalmost all of the water available within a 239 square km watershed area. 5. The elimination of the Boat Harbour Basin and the change in location for the receivingwater means that more pollutants would reach the Northumberland Strait than compared to thecurrent system.6. I believe there would be a protest of 'never before seen in NS' proportion to stop a BoatHarbour extension and a pipe from going into the Northumberland Strait. And this would notbe about a community whining that it didn't \"get its way\". This has been a 50 year plus battlefor a lot of people.7. Many first nations people and non-natives have had this pollution dumped on them for over50 years. But our entire, and one and only Mi'kmaq community have been victims ofenvironmental racism from the beginning and throughout the entire history of this mill. It mustbe stopped and they must be protected and respected in a real and meaningful way movingforward. Moving the pollution from their backyard to their front yard and putting their fishing fleet at risk would not be the way to do this. A sincere thank you for the opportunity to be engaged with this very important issue. I do not envy the position you're in but I do know that enough information is available to back yourdecision should you not approve this project. #noextension #nopipe #honourtheact From: Environment To: Environment Assessment Web Account Subject: Proposed Project Comments Date: February 23, 2019 12:37:25 AM Project: replacement_effluent_treatment_facility_project Comments: Give NP the extension required and do not let the mill close even temporarily Assessment Web Account Subject: Proposed Project Date: February 23, 2019 5:00:37 AM Project: replacement_effluent_treatment_facility_project Comments: We need to support this project to ensure a prosperous future for our children and their children.

Sincerely, MSc MD FRCPC(Int Med) FRCPC(Rad Onc) rtd To: Our provincial government Re: Northern Pulp Replacement Effluent Treatment Facility Project Change is difficult. But this is exactly what both the Ivany Report (2014) and the Independent Review (Lahey , 2018) challenge us to do within the forestry industry in Nova Scotia. Both emphasize the importance of biodiversity and the health of our forests. I am convinced that now, urgently, the forest industry in Nova Scotia must adopt practices to become eco -friendly and sus tainable. Never has this been better illustrated than in the Northern Pulp (NP) proposal to run a 15.5 km pipeline for effluent in support of its current activities. Forestry practices that currently feed Northern Pulp are heavily reliant on clear cutting, and are decimating Acadian woodland biodiversity with monoculture replanting of short turnaround species. It has severely polluted Boat Harbour and environs, and there has been at least one significant effluent pipeline leak on land (47 million litres, June 9, 2014) . A few kilometres of pipeline were incompetently maintained and monitored, yet now a line is proposed that traverses the Pictou Harbour Causeway, the Pictou town roundabout, the TransCanada Highway for several kilometres, and enter s the harbour at the Ferry Terminal - a proud, major point of entry from PEI, and also of the Pictou Island Ferry . In the Executive Summary of The Northern Pulp Replacement Effluent Treatment Project report, Table E1.1.1 , Northern Pulp anticipates NO SIGN IFICANT (NS) impact on each and every environmental and socio -economic metric, through every phase of the project, including accidents . This must be considered ludicrous conje cture. One example from the plan, the construction of a 4 km trench, 9 m wide and 3 m deep, would most certainly result in a SIGNIFICANT impact on the ocean floor. Construction activities and resulting sediment would have significant negative effects within Caribou Harbour and beyond. Then the introduction of 60 -90 million liters o f treated effluent each day would certainly have an effect on marine habitat, lobster larvae, lobster and herring. The Northumberland Strait waters source our \"world famous\" Nova Scotia lobster fisheries. Our north shore fishing community will be providing more educated, experienced input. But, in fact, the lobster fisheries of 3 maritime provinces share risk here. It is not reassuring to read the note in the NP report that \"unlike the visual impact experienced today, it is anticipated (italics added ) that the effluent plume will not be visible when it reaches the water's surface\" (Executive Summary). It is not the visual impact of the effluent which is the largest risk to the long term sustainability of the fishery. Further, there must be some doubt about whether a short term exposure test can predict the long term impact on this important fishery. Nova Scotia boasts of its Northumberland Shore with the \"warmest waters north of the Carolinas\". The site of effluent discharge would be into these water s and within sight of four islands, all of which are permanently or seasonally inhabited - Caribou Island, Caribou and Munroe Island Pr ovincial Park, Pictou Island, and Prince Edward Island . Not only the commercial use, but the recreational use of effluent waters and the potential socio -economic impact on local residents and businesses gives pause. In Se ction 2.1.1.1, pg 8 of the report, Northern Pulp notes that they have achieved 80 -99% reduction within the mill of \"mill- wide particulate emissions, odorous emissions, and boiler particulate emissions\", yet in spite of this, the residents of and visitors to Pictou (and within many kilometres of the town) still note skin, respiratory and sensory symptoms. The Canadian Environmental Law Association (website) defines the precautionary principle in environmental decision -making to \"denote a duty to prevent ha rm, when it is possible to do so, even when all the evidence is not in\"; that is, even in the setting of simply, uncertainty, decisions should favour health and sustainability of the environment. Thus, the NP effluent pipeline project must be refused: t his is especially so, since there exists an alternative in-mill, closed -loop effluent treatment option. I believe that Pictou County can survive , and indeed thrive after a decision to deny the proposed effluent treatment plan, and could withstand a temporary (downtime for the conversion to closed -loop system) or even permanent closure of the mill. Michelin , Pictou County plant, recently announce d that they are to make 200 part-time jobs permanent and will hire 150 more (Chronicle Herald, October 2 3, 2018) . People will be more likely to come and to stay - currently we have instances of folks leaving Pictou because of the blight of the mill on the landscape and on the senses . Visitor numbers to Pictou will be improved and local businesses will be a ble to reinvigorate. I also believe that the hardworking, innovative woodlot owners would also thrive when relieved of current constraints . Certainly, a Federal Environmental Assessment of the proposed effluent plan is required, but not only the water testing, but also of the potential impact of a leak along the full length of the proposed 15.5 km pipeline. Again, the larger issue to be addressed is how to better sustain the forestry industry in this province, to launch eco -friendly practices, with minimized impact on the environment, other industries (fishery, tourism and small businesses ), and importantly, on the health and wellbeing of the r esidents of Nova Scotia. With this effluent treatment pipeline proposal, Northern Pulp, a foreign -owned entity, has pitted the forestry industry against the regional fishery, local businesses and residents. In 2014, following the Ivany Report, a group in to continue the positive discussions and devised a vision for Pictou County: \"In 2020, Pic tou County will be healthy, united, thriving and bold.\" I support the Nova Scotia Government in upholding the January 31, 2020 date for closure of the Boat Ha rbour site, and encourage the immediate prioritization of working with the forestry industry to a dopt sustainable practices with respect for environmental values and the health of Nova Scotians . Effluent into the Northumberland Strait via the proposed pipeline should not be part of that practice. Now is the time for strong Government action, and for change. , MSc MD FRCPC(Internal @yahoo.com Environment Assessment Web Account Subject: Proposed Project Comments Date: February 23, 2019 10:35:15 AM Project: - Choose - Comments: My name is I live in Caribou River approximately 20 minutes from the Town of Pictou. Our homeoverlooks the Northumberland Strait. We moved here from Halifax 15 years ago after fallingin love with the area while coming here to visit friends who live on Caribou Island. We fell inlove with the Town of Pictou, with the pristine, clear and warm waters of the NorthumberlandStrait and the people who live in Pictou County. From our home we can watch the lobsterfishers, the herring fishers, the ferry to PEI and in late February we watch the seals givingbirth to their pups and listen to their converstions with one another on the ice. In the summerwe enjoy the many beaches found around Pictou County. When we moved here 15 years ago,the Town of Pictou was a bustling small Town with lovely shops on the main street. Over theyears we have watched this change dramatically. Not being a business owner, I am sure that itwas not good for business when there were days, with the wind in the wrong direction, thatone could hardly breath when one got out of their vehicle due to the stench and \u00e2?ofog\u00e2? ofthe discharge from Northern Pulp. It doesn\u00e2?Tt take a scientific mind to figure out that touristswill not want to stay in a place where you can hardly breath. Northern Pulp was asked to fixthis problem time and time again to no avail. Yes, they say they have improved the air qualityin leaps and bounds, however I invite you to come to Pictou when the wind is blowing in onthe Town. There is no difference. Then, of course, there is Boat Harbour. This environmentaldisaster has gone on for far too long. The people of Pictou Landing First Nations should nothave to suffer with this any longer. And it is not just the First Nations people. There weremany people who had cottages in Boat Harbour where they once swam, fished and enjoyednature. Unfortunately, those cottages are no more as is the nature that surrounded them.Enough is enough. Now, Northern Pulp wants to pollute the waters of the NorthumberlandStrait. Northern Pulp does not have a very good track record as far as trust and being a \u00e2?ogood corporate neighbour\u00e2? goes. They cannot guarantee that there will be no adverseaffect to this pipe going into the Strait. Waters that are so clear that on a calm day it is likeswimming in the Carribean are in danger as is the marine life that lives there. The waters ofthe Northumberland Strait are, as they say, \u00e2?othe warmest waters north of the Carolinas\u00e2? .Now Northern Pulp wants to pump more warm fresh water into the Strait which will raisetemperatures unnaturally. I have been swimming at Chance Harbour once which is not to farfrom Boat Harbour. The water is orange. I could not believe it. Why would tourists come hereto swim in orange water. They say they are doing all they can to meet the Provincial andFederal Regulations. They said the same about the air quality. I am in no way a scientificperson, however, I am a person very concerned about the environment and what we are doingto it. I know what I see and smell. I realize that this issue is very contentious here in PictouCounty and has driven a wedge between a lot of people. I also don\u00e2?Tt believe that NorthernPulp should be allowed to hold people hostage - \u00e2?oNo Pipe. No Mill\u00e2? . No one wants tosee people loose their jobs in either sector. We just want Northern Pulp to do the right thing asthe people of Pictou County have been asking them to do for the last 50 years. On behalf ofmyself, and my husband, I implore you not to allow Northern Pulp to put this pipe into theNorthumberland Strait. Make them do what is right for all people of Pictou County. Thankyou for taking the time to read this letter.

If it is as safe as they claim then they should have noproblem with this. Name: .me To: Environment Assessment Web Account Subject: Proposed Project Comments Date: February 23, 2019 2:16:15 PM Project: replacement_effluent_treatment_facility_project Comments: The Pictou pulp mill has been both an important environmental problem considering the destruction of Boat Harbourand a major economic problem considering the enormous amount of public money that hasbeen diverted into keeping the mill going for years and it is time that this stop. Anenvironment assessment by either the provincial or federal authorities is not reassuringbecause the types of tests involved would only detect severe short-term affects of the effluente.g. the number of fish which would die in 24 h. What about the effects of long term lowlevels of pollution? There is also the problem of the devastation that the mill is doing to forestsin Nova Scotia. The Lehey report clearly indicates there is need for a revision of forestrypractices, and in particular less clear cutting. In addition, conserving our forests, and allowingabused forests to recover, is extremely import at this point in time, as expanding living forestsis the best way for Nova Scotia to contribute to reducing climate change by providingincreased canopy covered lands to sequester of CO2. Certainly extending the use of BoatHarbour would be further insult to the indigenous peoples that have been so strongly affectedby the mill. The environmental racism has gone on far too long. This is a very appropriatetime to reconsider forestry practices and to reorganize the forestry industry. We need betterpractices, such as selection cutting where the canopy is retained, and focus on high end uses ofharvested wood. Biomass burning, such as done at the Pictou mill is a particulat concern as itis a polluting as burning coal not to mention the removal of trees that could absorb CO2. Thegovernment needs to take on a leadership role there, rather than letting it all drag on.

I think it should be a Federal EnvironmentalAssessment.I also do not want to see the affluent going into our marine environment. Name: Email: @ns.sympatico.ca Environment Assessment Web Account Subject: Proposed Project Date: February 23, 2019 4:55:21 PM Project: replacement_effluent_treatment_facility_project Comments: I am writing with regards to the plan for the bleached kraft pulp mill in Pictou County, Nova Scotia to pumpmany 60-90 millions of litres of effluent into the Northumberland Strait on a daily basis. Ihave read the Replacement Effluent Treatment Facility Project Description and Appendices intheir entirety and I have grave concerns. The issue I have chosen to address in this letter is thatof toxic chemicals being released into the Northumberland Strait. Using the numberspresented in the Project Proposal and Appendices, I calculate a total of approximately half atonne of Adsorbable Organic Halides AOX per day will be released into the Strait. AppendixE3 1 reports that the maximum AOX in the effluent is 7.8mg/L. If we are conservative andassume only 60 million litres of effluent are discharged per day this would equate to 468 kg ofAOX per day into the Northumberland Strait. Below I outline why I recommend the proposalbe rejected. Appendix I1-B, panel 9 2 roughly outlines the effluent composition andpercentage removal of chlorinated compounds by the treatment facility. I use the word \u00e2?oroughly\u00e2? because the categories listed are very general organics, metals, chlorinatedorganics, etc and do not contain the actual chemical composition of each category. The millhas stated they cannot predict the chemical composition of the effluent because it is \u00e2?odetermined by the make-up of the wood being processed on any given day.\u00e2? 3 Paidadvertisements by the mill emphasize the effluent will be treated, however, the new facility isexpected to remove only 45-65 of the chlorinated compounds. Many of the chlorinated andnon-chlorinated organic compounds produced during the pulp bleaching process are toxic andare not readily degraded. For example, the highly toxic polychlorinated dioxins and furans arereported below the detection threshold stated by the laboratory performing the tests, and it hasbeen deemed no longer necessary to test for them. It should be noted that \u00e2?onot detected\u00e2?does not mean the substance is not present. They are known to be generated during the pulpingprocess. Furthermore, many of these compounds bio-accumulate in fatty tissue, which meansthey are not cleared by an organism, but continue to accumulate and, as a result, theconcentration is increased higher up the food chain. Given that the proposed treatment facilityonly removes about half of the organic chemicals that will be released into theNorthumberland Strait, we need further investigation into the long-term health effects. It isimportant to note not all of the chemicals present in the effluent are tested or the chemicalcomponents of the effluent are fully understood. The following statement is from the CanadianEnvironmental Protection Act 4: \u00e2?oAlthough approximately 250 individual compounds havebeen characterized in bleachery effluents, they have been estimated to represent only 10 to 40of the total low molecular weight materials present.\u00e2? I am not confident that we truly knowthe effect of the chemical mixture on biological systems. Some may argue the toxins arewithin the allowable limit or there are no established limits. Stantec consultants in AppendixE3 5 state \u00e2?oThere are no CCME or provincial guidelines for AOX for marine or freshwaterenvironments.\u00e2? In Appendix I1-B, panel 23 2, the AOX is predicted to be below the WorldBank Group Guidelines 6 within 2 metres of the diffuser. These guidelines should not be usedto justify acceptable limits of AOX as the concentrations listed in the guidelines vary based onthe technology used for pulp and paper. For example the limit of AOX for bleached kraft pulpmill is 0.25kg/ADt while the limit for sulfite pulp and paper is 0.005 kg/ADt 6. This impliesthe limits are not set based on the effect they have on health or environment, but rather on theconcentrations produced by the methodology employed in the paper industry. If the concernwere truly about AOX exposure, the limits of allowable amounts would be the same for all processes. Based on this information I conclude it is not an acceptable set of guidelines to be used for establishing concentration limits of AOX in the effluent. The experiments used to determine the effect of stress toxins, temperature, salinity, pH, turbidity, etc. on an organismhave come a long way since the early 1990\u00e2?Ts therefore an LC50 experiment should nolonger be considered sufficient. Sub lethal exposure may still affect the physiology and geneexpression of the fish and/or shellfish and this is something we need to understand. We knowmany of the halogenated organic compounds affect the reproductive and immune systems, andcan lead to developmental disorders or cause cancer. In addition, gene expression experimentshelp gain a better understanding of the exposure effects on protein and enzyme productionwhich gives us an idea of how the effluent will influence the function of biological processes.I request gene expression profiling experiments be performed on fish and shellfish that areexposed to the effluent at concentrations consistent with what will exit at the diffuser finaleffluent \u00e2?\" NOT once it is diluted and compared to the same species that has not beenexposed. In Appendix H, it is stated \u00e2?oTo address the concern, NPNS will commissiontoxicity testing to determine both potential acute and sublethal effects on immature stages oflobster and herring. Standardized toxicity testing protocols are not available for lobster andherring however, custom tests have been developed that can be completed using larval lobsterand herring embryos. The tests will include Stage I-IV larval lobster and include a live-deadacute assessment of the various stages, as well as the assessment of sublethal effects onmoulting time and growth. Herring tests on embryos would be similar in that they wouldassess acute toxicity to eggs, as well as the growth post-hatch for a number of days.\u00e2? Thesetests are not sufficient to assess long-term effects of toxic effluent exposure and do notexamine multiple biological processes. Below is an excerpt from the Canadian EnvironmentalProtection Act 4 \u00e2?oSome chlorinated organic compounds can be biologically degraded ortransformed and transformation may lead to more persistent and bio accumulative compounds.Chloroveratroles, for example, transformation products of chloroguaiacols which are unique tobleached pulp mill effluents, are capable of accumulating in fish up to 25 000 times theconcentration in water. Some other chlorinated organic compounds detected in biologicaltissues downstream of bleached pulp mills reflect repeated or long-term exposure rather thanhigh bio accumulative potentials.\u00e2? And \u00e2?oLaboratory studies using individual chlorinatedorganic compounds that are commonly discharged from bleached pulp mills havedemonstrated such chronic effects as deformities, and embryo and larval mortalities in fish.These chronic effects include significant irreversible factors which jeopardize the continuanceof the species and the integrity of the ecosystem.\u00e2? My confidence in the proposal is furtherundermined by the following disclaimer from KSH consultants in Appendix C regarding the\u00e2?oPreliminary Engineering for Effluent Treatment Plant Replacement\u00e2? \u00e2?oThis report andany or all associated estimates included herein are indicative only and should not be viewed asdefinitive.

Any representations and warranties provided by KSH to the recipient in connectionwith the proposed project shall be limited only to those set forth in a definitive agreement tobe entered into between the parties.\u00e2? This statement implies we cannot take the numbersseriously and they are not to be held accountable if any of the assumptions are incorrect. Overthe past year and a half I have seen the county divided. It is divided because the currency forthe discussion is \u00e2?ojobs\u00e2? . Politically, I understand why. However, I think it is incrediblyshort sighted on our part. We need to understand what the volume and composition of wastewill do to the local ecosystem and what will be the long reaching effects. Half a tonne of toxic AOX chemicals along with the rest of the substances in the effluent every day into the Northumberland Strait is unconscionable. I have added an appendix to this letter that containsseveral other points that came to mind while reading through the literature for the proposal.Please consider these points as well. Thank you for taking the time to read this letter andplease consider that we could potentially be destroying the sensitive aquatic ecosystem of theNorthumberland Strait and rendering it uninviting for aquatic species and human recreation ifthe current proposal is granted. We could also be poisoning and/or killing the fish and therebypoisoning ourselves. I beg you to ensure the proper and current experiments are performedbefore pulp effluent is pumped into the strait. It is my opinion that the limits of allowabletoxins and effects of said toxins are not well established. Please copy me on the environmentalassessment report once your office has made their decision.

This is due to the fact that the province of Nova Scotia has financialstake in this project moving forward with its contribution towards the investigation ofpotential proposals for the effluent pipe. The current assessment, with its 30 day window forthe submission of pubic comment, is not an adequate period of time for the public to fully readand understand Northern Pulps 1700 page submission.

My Sub-Specialty training included studying and treating theeffects of environmental toxins on the developing brain. There are many toxins which affectthe brain, However I will focus on Methyl Mercury and Particulate MatterPM 2.5. Myconcerns are the unaccountable loss of several tons of mercury in the 1970\u00e2?Ts near PLFN.The peak was 5 tons of mercury in 1975 Canada Press 1977. This would be an estimated lossof 10-15 tons over a 10 year period Montreal Gazette archives. In my opinion, we are testingfate with this amount of Methyl Mercury in the ground. JIF Consulting has found 3 areas ofmercury in the groundwater surrounding Pictou Landing. Methyl Mercury bio-accumulates inseafood. Humans who consume seafood with Methyl Mercury can develop Minamata disease.This is a devastating disease which first was encountered in Minamata Bay in Japan wherehumans developed this disorder after consumption of toxic seafood. There is no treatment forthis disease. Pregnant mothers transfer this Methyl Mercury to the placenta to the developingfetus causing severe brain damage. In Canada, we have had Minamata disease diagnosed inOntario, Grassy Narrows and White Dog First Nations communities. This developed afterDryden Pulp and Paper spilled 10 tons of mercury into their river. Pumping toxic effluentdirectly into the Northumberland Strait is not an acceptable alternative for all the abovereasons. The effluent will not be toxin free no matter how treated and will bio-accumulate inbi-valves mussels, scallops, oysters and lobsters. Seafood will be contaminated. The archaicexpression dilution is the solution to pollution is no longer acceptable. Humans are at risk! Wehave the most pristine cold waters and export seafood to a dollar value of 2.0 Billion Dollarsin 2017. Infrastructure at Halifax Stanfield Airport has begun to increase with holding areasfor lobster and 3-5 air cargo shipments to China per week, as well as to Seoul, Korea. Whywould we want to put this at risk? With regards to air pollution, Northern Pulp emits 63 of allthe PM2.5 in NS of all business\u00e2?Ts combined. WHO in 2013 declared PM2.5 carcinogenic toHumans . Once in the air it can stay in the air days to weeks and travel hundred\u00e2?Ts tothousand\u00e2?Ts of miles. The new precipitator installed on the recovery boiler address\u00e2?Ts theodour but not the PM2.5. The main boiler has no precipitator. We are concerned about ourlocal lumber industry and how they would be forced to adapt if the Mill ceases to operate. Thelumber Industry will change in the upcoming year when the new laws will be enactedregarding sustainable forestry practices. It will be a reshaping of the Lumber and ForestryIndustry and they will need direction and support from the community and the FederalGovernment. It is never Wealth over Health, It\u00e2?Ts always Health over Wealth. Thisinformation has been exposed over and over again. 50 years of environmental racism isshameful and it is time to resolve this issue. Honour the Boat Harbour act. We need a FederalAssessment, not just a Provincial assessment. No more extensions. People\u00e2?Ts Health andHigh Quality standards of environmental protection should be our goal.

If 85 Million Litres of Effluent is processed per day, that equates to around 4 Tonnes of TSS per day into the Strait. Even if that meets the 25 year old PPER, it still poses a major risk to the marine species in that area. The EA states that with the proposed AST facility, that TSS will be higher than the old waste process. This us unacceptable. Sincerely, From: To: Environment Assessment Web Account Subject: Support of Approval Permit Date: February 25, 2019 9:13:54 AM Good Morning I am writing a letter in support of an approval permit for a Class 1 Environmental Assessment for the replacement system for Boat Harbour submitted by Northern Pulp on January 31,2019.I believe the company has put many long hours into this assessment and has done a thoroughjob making sure all environmental standards have been met. I know that the Boat Harboursetup was not the way to go but back in 1967 environmental standards were not in place likethey are today and technology in these areas has changed substantially in the last 50 years. Thenew owner of Northern Pulp has already done work to this mill over the years he has hadownership to reduce his environmental footprint with technologies such as the newprecipitator which has reduced the emissions going into the atmosphere and is now willing toput the money into the new effluent treatment facility. This new facility will treat the effluenton site before ever leaving the mill eliminating the risk of another effluent leak from everhappening again.Northern Pulp has found the best existing technology today for Bleach KraftPulp Mills . The owner has also proposed an O2 delignification after the treatment plant isbuilt which will reduce chemical usage along with water consumption reducing the amount ofeffluent. I believe that the Remediation of Boat Harbour has to happen for not just the FirstNations people of Pictou Landing but for all the residence of Pictou Landing but I feel that thegovernment has not given Northern Pulp enough time to complete the entire process for this tohappen. At the beginning when the Premier gave the deadline of January 31, 2020 there were only 7 studies to apply for an EA but ended up being a total of 28. These studies take time andsome of them can only be done in certain seasons. It has come out recently that the companythat is to be in charge of the Remediation of Boat Harbour will not be able to start work on theexpected date due to delays. I would like to ask you how it is fair that this company that hadthe same amount of time to get their ducks in a row is entitled to an extension but NorthernPulp who has taken on all these extra studies that kept coming up throughout this process isnot entitled to an extension? Any project whether it be a new school, hospital or effluenttreatment facility all have delays that are out of their control. Northern Pulp has had manyobstacles whether it be the weather, having to find an alternate route for the pipeline right upto the blocking of their survey boat which I'm sure you have most likely seen on the news. Ifeel that it is only fair that you give the same exception to Northern Pulp as you are to thecompany in charge of the Remediation. I have lived in Pictou County for my entire life (30 years) and feel that the closure of the pulpmill would be detrimental to the county and also the entire province. Throughout my life Ihave seen the impact that it has had on this county when places like Maritime Steel andTrenton Works had closed and the economy was in a better place than it is today.I believe all the industries involved fisheries, forestries and the pulp mill can coexist. I believethat the EA brought forth by Northern Pulp will pass all environmental standards and that thisCounty and Province will continue to prosper. Respectfully Sent from my iPhone From: To: Environment Assessment Web Account Subject: northern pulp proposal for environmental assessment Date: February 25, 2019 10:38:08 AM I have read and noted the Registration Document dated Jan. 31, 2019 and to the attention of Ms. Helen Yeh, Environmental Assessment Officer. What follows are my comments on sameand my views on the proposal to pump large volumes of pulp effluent into the Strait ofNorthumberland. At pages 8 and 9 of this submission is found the following statement: \"For its entire fifty yearhistory the BHETF has discharged into the Northumberland Strait at the outlet of the BoatHarbour Estuary.\" My comments on this seeming justification for continuing a process rifewith environmental negative consequences- Yes this is true, and what have been the impactsof that? 1. pollution of Pictou Harbour (see study of cancer development in mussels in cages atstrategic locations in the said Harbour and in the areas immediate to the Harbour's mouth.)Second, this outfall is a black pitchy mess that has caused the closure of one of Nova Scotia'smost popular beaches (Lighthouse Beach); it has also resulted in the closing of the swimmingarea for the Girl Guides Camp (MacLellan's Girl Guide Camp- east of the Boat Harbouroutfall; those children have been bussed to Melmerby Beach just to be able to have their swimlessons). Lobster traps that had been set in the area of the outfall and to the east of the outfallhave had to be moved as the bottom does not allow a habitat for the lobster to thrive in. Theeffects on A'se'k (the other room) or Boat Harbour are abundantly clear!Next: Here is a glaring and serious flaw in Northern Pulp's submission; it cannot be minimizedand must not be ignored. At Section 2.3, page 11 is this statement: \"Due to the EARegistration submission timing, the study period did not facilitate full biological fieldassessments for the current proposed transmission pipeline corridor.\" And \"Field studies for the marine environment have been hampered by both seasonal constraints... and by physicalopposition and obstruction...\" To proceed with any project given this admission by the proponent is totally unacceptable andamounts to a rolling of the dice that cannot be endorsed at any level of meaningful analysisand assessment. For a company to submit this as part of its plan is simply an admission that ithas not done its work robustly! Here is the quote from this EA submission that shows howslack and lacking in thoroughness this proposal is. \"The existing environmental conditions andassociated potential environmental effects of the project therefore have been defined based onEXISTING AVAILABLE INFORMATION {non-specified} and OTHER DESKTOPSOURCES.\" Are they kidding? They did some Google searches and that is robust, competent,scientific analysis and assessment? No, it is blatantly insufficient, and presumptuous in theextreme. The proponent has chosen to put money into advertisements and sponsored mediacontent. It should have started in 2015 when the Boat Harbour Act became the law of the landand done its due diligence. For Northern Pulp to state that it feels that their superficial analysisis justified given what it frames as a \"... practice (that) is consistent with federal and otherprovincial EA processes...\" is ludicrous and irresponsible, especially given the magnitude andlikely negative impacts to the fishery and to tourism that account for several billion dollars ofeconomic activity every year. These interests have been consulted and their opposition to thispipe in the Strait is uniform and persistent. In a nutshell, the tourists operators and thefishermen will never support this proposal. As to the feelings of those who cottage and campalong the Strait, there feelings have been made clear in their attendance in very large numbersat numerous public awareness sessions. The provincial government has heard these voices andthe Boat Harbour Act has addressed some of the concerns. The views of the ordinary citizenshave been documented and a survey of these letters to the editor will show where the majority of people come down on the proposal to pipe pulp effluent to Caribou Harbour and dispose of it there or anywhere in the Strait. Hopefully the Government of Nova Scotia has seen fit to assess this citizen commentary; it is relevant. With regard to the fishery particularly, there are several points that need to be made. There is ample evidence to support the concern that there will be bioaccumulation of deleterious, toxicsubstances that will impact the development of lobster larvae and will also cause the lobster tomove to more hospitable environments in which to feed and reproduce. Pulp effluent in theFisheries Act and other documentation is clearly identified as \"toxic\". Further, Northern Pulphas never identified the constituents that are in this effluent; the company has refused to do so.How can any government department, be it federal or provincial, sanction any such effluent ifthe constituent elements and each of their concentrations is not clearly established? In terms ofknown toxic and even lethal substances, it is clear that dioxins and furans are in the liquideffluent in Boat Harbour. It is clear, and has been most recently established with a publishedstudy by six Dalhousie scientists, that there are at least three known carcinogens that leave thestacks at Northern Pulp. They are in the form of 1,3 butadiene, carbon tetra chloride andbenzene. That study also stated that these three elements exceed the Environemtal ProtectionAgency standards for safe emission levels. The aforesaid study also indicated the inadequacyof monitoring of such emissions. In other words, it stated that the monitoring stations areimproperly sited and there are too few of them. As of this writing, it is believed that themonitoring station in the Town of Pictou ( the only one in the Town, is inactive). How can thisbe allowed to persist? As to the siting of the marine outfall to allegedly \"minimize potential impact to marine water quality...\". How can this claim be made when the constituent elements of the effluent and the concentrations of each have not been established? A study done in the early 1990's, with thelead author being S,. A. Jones, indicated that the release of effluent stays in the water columnthat it is released in for many kilometres and is found in \"measurable amounts\" even at adistance of thirty-six kilometres. How then can the proposal from Northern Pulp claim,without any significant modelling, that ambient conditions will return to the norm within a fewmetres of the outfall? This claim arrived at through inadequate modelling does not jive withthe study just referenced. The NP submission also states that it feels that a pipe in theStraitwill be a visual improvement to the existing obvious visual effects of today. It should beremembered that it was advocates for the pulp mill who in 1965 were telling residents andFirst Nations that there would be nothing but clear water coming out of Boat Harbour. In theliterature put out at the November, 2017 meeting sponsored by Northern Pulp at the WellnessCentre in Pictou County at pages two and three it showed several beakers with the one to thefar right showing a clear beaker of what looks like water. Once again, this is what NorthernPulp is saying the effluent will look like when it exits the pipe. I found this tactic to bereminiscent of what was displayed to the public in the mid 1960's. And, of course, theillustration then was dishonest and lacked genuineness. This submission by Northern Pulp also states that there will be a surfacing of the effluent. I am sure that the boaters and swimmers in PEI, Pictou Island, in Brule and Tatamagouche will bepleased to hear that there will be effluent on the surface of the waters of the NorthumberlandStrait. Even more significant than the surface visual effects will be what happens to the marinebiota and flora. This proposal does nothing to convince me that any best practices have beenfollowed in the sense of solid scientific research, modelling and assessment to ascertain thelikely impacts on these. It is what cannot be seen from the surface and what willbioaccumulate that will be most devastating to marine species. When so many livelihoods insustainable industries could be so affected, why should such a gamble as the one being offered in this proposal be entertained? The federal government needs to intervene here and make its own determination as to the \"significance of environmental effects of the project.\" The federalgovernment also must assess whether or not the Department of Environment in Nova Scotiahas duly consulted with First Nations people in the Maritime Provinces ,as to this proposal! Dillon Consulting in this submission to the Nova Scotia Department of Environment suggests that First Nations have been one of the groups offering \"valuable input and raised importantquestions\", yet it is very clear that this input has not at all been reflected in the submissionDillon has made on behalf of the proponent. First Nations may have been asked for input, butthey have not been MEANINGFULLY CONSULTED. There is a huge difference, and it isone that has implications for the involvement of the Federal Government of Canada.It must benoted that the relationship that has developed between Pictou Landing First Nation andNorthern Pulp has not been harmonious in any sense. The proposal to run a pipe along the roadside, within a right of way is fraught with numerous problems. Also, the pipe itself will be an ugly presentation for all to view- even those whodisembark from the ferry in Caribou. Tourists avoid the area now by driving quickly throughPictou County to other more pristine destinations. This has been clearly articulated bynumerous people in the tourist and retail sectors. The owner-operators of Pictou Lodge havebeen making this abundantly clear for many years. The Municipality of Pictou County has voted to support a firm closure date for Boat Harbour. It also has to give due consideration as to whether it will permit the passage of this effluentpipe over Municipal lands and watersheds. This is also the case , and more particularly so, forthe Town of Pictou which depends to a significant extent on well-water supplies that thisproposed pipe will pass over. There are so many problems with running the pipe withing the right of way of the highway that it would be exhaustive to mention them all, but here are three concerns: 1. The proposalstates that \"The pipe may also be installed withing a paved portion of highway 106 to avoidexisting infrastructure or environmentally sensitive features.\" So, tractor trailers, buses,cars,motorcycles will be travelling alongside a pipe carrying effluent and the barriers betweenthem will be a guardrail. Really!2. It is proposed that a \"boring method\" will be used to send the pipe around the current andrecently redesigned rotary in Pictou. Again, really? In an area that is just beginning to give theTown of Pictou some promising retail development? 3. As far as decommissioning of this pipe , the plan, if it can be called such, is to leave everything in the ground or under the waterand to merely cap it off after it has been cleared of the effluent in it. Hey, no problems here,just let mother nature and the future taxpayers deal with it. The legislature of Nova Scotia has passed a law that will be followed, as being law abiding is in the best interests of all of us. To suggest that we should break the law to convenience anyparty is not tenable.Therefore the Boat Harbour Act must be followed to the letter. Lastly, thecompany Northern Pulp/ Paper Excellence opted to take a stance on how to \"negotiate\" withall interested and concerned parties with respect to a new effluent treatment proposal. It nowproposes to hold effluent at Abercrombie Point for no more than two days before it transportsit into the Strait. This is not an improvement over the existing treatment. The proponent hasnot done diligent work with respect to appropriate modelling nor proper and completeassessment of the potential harmful effects of this proposal if it were to be implemented. Itused numerous excuses as to why such thoroughness was not possible. It did not point to its own hesitation to get at this from the time that the Boat Harbour Act was passed. That is on the company. The company chose brinkmanship as a negotiating ploy. Brinkmanship is notpart of a negotiating process that is used until late stages when one party or another opts fordesperate moves. This was not a good faith approach by the proponent, and it has led to the divisions of not just the local communities, but to communities more distant. The strategy hasalso had the effect of strongly uniting previously loosely - connected elements; for that weshould be thankful since being united in a cause can help to level the playing field. That, in myview, is what has happened in this matter. The leanings of the majority is found in theproclamations and meetings and press relaeses offered by the various, but now united, entitieswhich include but are not limited to the following: Pictou Landing First Nations and the otherFirst Nations communities in the Maritimes; Friends of the Northumberland Strait; Clean theMill; the Fishermen's associations from across the Maritimes; the government of PrinceEdward Island; concerned citizens.There is a determination among all of these elements to advocate for the workers at the mill inAbercrombie and to advocate for the independent contractors who provide the mill withproduct should a closure of the mill occur. It is this determination to advocate and secure bestresults possible for these workers and contractors that is on the record. It is also thiscommitment that may be the force to re- fuse relationships that have soured because of theeffects of the proposal to handle pulp waste in the manner that this proposal advocates. From: @ns.sympatico.ca To: Environment Assessment Web Account Subject: Northern Pulp's Replacement Effluent Treatment Facility Project Date: February 25, 2019 11:56:02 AM Attachments: My letter to the Environment Minister.docx Good Morning I am including my letter to the Environment Minister on my interest in the Northern Pulp issueand the assessment that is taking place on this subject at this time.King Regards, Re: Request for Designation for CEAA Federal Assessment - Northern Pulp Effluent Treatment Facility I am writing this letter in regards to Northern Pulp's Replacement Effluent Treatment Facility Project. My name is and I have been a resident of , Nova Scotia for the past 3 7 years. I have also worked at the same Company for 35 years (Sobeys Inc) . Previous to that I grew up in , Pictou County, Nova Scotia which is on the Sunrise Trail and not far from the coast. In the summer months we spend our time at our cottage in Caribou Island. We enjoy swimming and walking the beautiful shoreline collecting drift wood and beach glass. It is a beautiful spot rich in mussels, quahogs, clams and razor fish with beautiful clear waters. When these shellfish are in season we will go down and walk the beach to get a few for an enjoyable summertime trea t. At the Ferry Wharf in Caribou , Pictou not far from our cottage it is a busy time in the spring , summer and fall months. Fishermen are getting their traps/gear and boats ready to go fishing for the season. The fishing industry is an anchor industry for Nova Scotia and several rural communities have survived for years and many times have thrived in the past and will continue in the future. It is also the same spot where the Northumberland Ferry docks to pick up and drop of Tourists from Nova Scotia to Prince Edward Island daily. It is a place of clean water, clean air and bountiful fish. My father was a fisherman for some years, he fished Lobster, Scallops and Herring and this livelihood is what supported our family. I now have two brother s that also fish for a living and have been doing so for years. It is in their blood and it is now what supports their family. I have cousins who also fish out of this area every year. And also had uncles who have since past but this was their source of income for which made families succeed and stay in Pictou County. If this pipe goes into the Strait and pumps effluent into the water, it does not just affect the Northumberland Strait this is part of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, this is a shared body of water for our t hree Provinces and the rest of Canada. Wastewater temperature also affects receiving waters. When discharged in large quantities, it can raise the temperature anywhere from 28 degrees Celsius in the winter to 38 degrees in the summer which means no marine life will survive. In the Northumberland Strait waters marine life spawns, nurses and migrates here, how is that possible if they are exposed to chemicals and heat? We are talking about wastes from an industry and turn it into a form of effluent waste and then pump into pipes underground into the Strait. The re are just too many variables, as it might not be recycled properly, or treated properly and unnoticed leaks can happen, it will have detrimental impact on the environment through air, water and soil pollution. In this letter there are three things that I would like to address that are just some of the concerns that I have with this assessment: Example #1: \"In paragraph 9.2.4 at page 501, NP states as noted previously, the project has two main sources of emissions/discharges. These sources may result in poten tial chronic human exposure to project -associated chemicals: \"Chemicals present in treated effluent and in air emissions may pose a poten tial human health risk if there is significant exposure to the project- associated chemicals. They are stating that it is a potential Human Health Risk. I am extremely concerned about the health of people living close to Northern Pulp. For decades air emissions from the mill have been a problem affecting resident's health and the main issue has been the cancer numbers in Pictou County and now they want to pump it into our water. Pulp and Paper mills pollute our water, air and soil. There are about 500 Kraft mills, and many thousands of other types of pulp and paper mills, in the world. Primary concerns include the use of chlorine- based bleaches and resultant toxic emissions to air, water, and soil Below is an article from the Globe in Mail in 2013 and then was once again updated in 2018. This article is stating the cancer rates in Pictou County back in 2013 with the effluent pumped to Boart Harbour. How high will those numbers go if the pipe goes into the water and effluent is released? According to Statistics Canada, the Pictou area has the seventh highest rate of cancer per 100,000 residents of the country's 106 health regions. The area around Saint John, N.B., which also has a pulp mill, is the only region with a sizable population that has higher cancer rates than Pictou. (Andreatta. David (2013) \"In Nova Scotia town, residents fight local mill's pollution \" Globe and Mail, 13 September). Example # 2: \"In paragraph 10.2.1 at page 521 , NP states a s noted below During operation of the ETF, there is potential for release of chemicals used in the treatment process as well. Such a spill may contaminate soils and Groundwater and, through runoff, contaminate watercourses. Contaminants may adversely affect fish . And fish habitat and waterfowl. Groundwater contamination may adv ersely affect nearby water Supplies! My concern with this section is the unsafe effect that can happen to the water supply, fish and marine life and human safety if there is an accidental release of dangerous material. We are talking lives and the rich eco- system that is being put at stake all for this company and their wealth, Northern Pulp had a recent leak in October 2018 although the Company did not think it was a huge deal because to them it was just a small one. It does not matter the size of the leak, it is the fact that it went unnoticed by the Company as it was reported by a couple out walking. There was another one at this plant 5 years ago. ( CBC News (2014) \" Northern Pulp mill shut down due to effluent leak\" CBC, 10 June) . Then in 2008, the underwater pipe broke and caused a lengthy shutdown of the mill. The Provincial taxpayers either loaned or gave the $15 million to make sure this would not happen again and then for it to happen so soon again is a huge concern. . I question the NP inspections and how many leaks are happenin g that the community is not aware off? And if a pipe is underground it will never be noticed! Example #3: \"In paragraph 9.2. 4 at page 501 , NP states as noted below As noted previously, the project has two main sources of emissions/discharges. These sources may result in potential chronic human exposure to project- associated chemicals: Chemicals present in treated effluent and in air emissions may pose a poten tial human health. There are three major exposure routes through which chemicals present in environmental media can enter the body: Inhalation, ingestion and dermal (skin) absorption. This can happen from ingestion of soils, dusts, drinking water and garden produce, local country food items (e.g., fish, shellfish and hunting) My concern with this paragraph is that any chemical flushed through a pipe to discharge 70 -90 million litres of effluent from a bleached Kraft mill is unacceptable for this day and age. Mill waste water continues to wreak havoc on surrounding e cosystems. Common sense can tell someone if chemicals are flushed into a water area then the first to digest the chemical s are zooplankton, plankton and krill which are the main food source for larger marine life. Then the lobster, herring, crab and tuna will ingest these contaminates and then eventually humans eat the pullulated food supply. The fish get contaminated and so do the people who eat it, which can cause exorbitant health problems in the future for humans. So basically we should not eat the food in the ground or fish the marine life and be watchful of ou r drinking as there is a potential for human exposure. So how do we live what is left? Based on the Northern Pulp's Treatment Project and the information that I provided, I feel that the marine life in the waters of the Northumberland Strait will cease to exist if this pipe goes through. As it is there is a deteriorating habitat for lobsters in the waters now and we need to get better control and come up wi th better data to sustain the management of our fishery resources. When this toxic waste harms one organism, it can end up destroying an entire food chain of aquatic life. Improperly disposed chemicals pollute marine life and kills sea mammals, corals an d fish. And any organism that digests affected marine life can have adverse effects. Over 1 million seabirds and sea mammals are killed by pollution every year. People who live in places with high levels of air pollutants have a 20% higher risk of death from lung cancer. This pipe is not a project that we want passed ! Fish and seafood are among Canada's largest exports of food products . Lobster, Atlantic salmon, snow crab and shrimp remains Canada's top species exported in terms of value, with over $2 billion worth in 2016. Aquaculture is the fastest growing food production activity in the world and a growing sector in Canada. Approximately 72,000 Canadians make their living from fishing and fishing related activities. Overall I feel that we need more information before the Minister can make her decision. We need an in -depth investigation. After reading this assessment there is so much evidence to show the likelihood that it will cause adverse effects on the fishery and marine life. And it will cause effects on Humans by air and water pollution. I feel that the Minister needs to reject this proposal. We need to have a Federal Environmental Assessment completed on this treatment facility. This project is undergoing a shorter, 50 -day provincial Class 1 assessment, which is unacceptable. It is outrageous that you can get a Federal assessment to do the cleanup at Boart Harbour when the damage is done after 50+ years. But you cannot get a Federal assessment when Northern Pulp wants to go and cause more of a threat to our environment. The government's past handling of effluent from this mill has resulted in one of the most contaminated sites in Canada, Boat Harbour. I want to see a strong, science based review of this project which will protect the present and future health of our Strait and the economy which depends on healthy waters. My question to you Minister... Remember i t only took one diseased steer to basically cripple the beef industry in Canada for 5 years. If this goes through there will be no fishery, can Canada live without that? Thank for taking the time to read this.

The time allotted after studies were completed was veryshort for such a Assessment Web Account Subject: Northern Pulp Effluent Pipe Date: February 25, 2019 11:06:42 PM To Whom it may Concern, I am writing on behalf of my family. My husband is a fisherman and we have 2 children. We all love to go fishing, go to the beach, go camping, go swimming, have fun & live life. The idea of putting a pipe into the Northumberland Strait may jeopardize all of the above things that we as a family love to do. It's just not all about the fishing industry but about tourism and everyday life that this will affect.I'm sure when they opened the mill and proposed all there information that they did not for see Boat Harbour turning out the way it is or at least I hope they didn't!! You have to have answers you can not speculate that it ishighly unlikely to harm the fisheries. If you can't say it won't then you shouldn't do it. There is too much at risk. Iknow there are people at the mill, the forestry industry, etc but there are also lots of people on the other side, if the pipe goes in and it ends up like Boat Harbour. Then what? We have residents, we have tourists, we have fishers andwe have fish, that what, don't count? If there is a minimal percentage that it could 25, 50, 100 years down the road, turn into a hazardous site like BoatHarbour then it's NO GOOD. We need guarantee there is going to be no affect! I have family, relatives, friends & strangers close and afar, that deserve & NEED answers. So please do the proper Federal Assessment and get answers.Some intresting points from section 9.2.4 \"Chemicals present in treated effluent and in air emissions may pose a potential human health risk if there issignificant exposure to the project-associated chemicals. As such, many of the chemicals present in treated effluentand in air emissions are considered to be candidate COPCs at this time.\"\"At this time, it is only possible to identify candidate COPCs that may be evaluated should a HHRA of the projectbe a regulatory requirement. This is due to the fact that chemical process engineering design work is continuing andthere is presently uncertainty regarding the likely chemical composition and characterization of the marine treatedeffluent discharge (including the potential concentrations of substances present in the effluent). \" There's a lot more vague information in his proposal, this is just one part of the proposal that doesn't give me a 100% guarantee the quality of life I want for my children! It doesn't give me a 100% guarantee that the pipe will notaffect my families livelihood!

Sincerly, Environment Assessment Web Account Subject: Comments NPNS Replacement Effluent Treatment Proposal Date: February 26, 2019 12:11:16 PM Attachments: Comments NP Effluent Treatment Proposal.pdf Please see attached document for comments. Thank you, To: Environmental Assessment Branch Nova Scotia Environment Nova Scotia Effluent Treatment Project Proposal Submitted by: Dear Sir or Madam, I respectfully submit the following comments on the Northern Pulp proposal for the replacement effluent treatment project (NP Proposal), as registered at your office on February 7, 2019. The proposal document is too voluminous to possibly comment on all of the sections that could be included here. Therefore, I have selected several issues that I feel I am able to reasonably comprehend and make valid comments on. I hold a Bachelor of Science from Mount St. Vincent University, and a Master of Public Health from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. In my academic work at both the undergraduate and graduate levels, I have had to read many research papers in various disciplines in order to fulfill coursework, including writing my own graduate thesis. Understanding the underlying challenges of collecting and analyzing data using statistical methodology, and the importance of appropriately communicating conclusions of studies has informed my comments below. My responses to the NP Proposal document include the following issues: Lack of scientific and statistical basis for many conclusions Use of ecological models without validation via observed data Lack of current and accurate baseline data Vague descriptions of the final effluent composition and impacts of solids content of effluent Omission of thermal pollution and global warming issues from effluent Irrelevance of Section 9 regarding human health impacts The first general comment that I wish to make about the NP Proposal is its lack of what is commonly referred to as 'scientific method '. There is a burden of work that must be completed in scientific endeavor. The best description that I could readily find on the internet (my underscores): 1. Make an observation or observations. 2. Ask questions about the observations and gather information. 3. Form a hypothesis \u2014 a tentative description of what's been observed, and make predictions based on that hypothesis. 4. Test the hypothesis and predictions in an experiment that can be reproduced. 5. Analyze the data and draw conclusions; accept or reject the hypothesis or modify the hypothesis if necessary. 6. Reproduce the experiment until there are no discrepancies between observations and theory. \"Replication of methods and results is my favorite step in the scientific method,\" Moshe Pritsker, a former post-doctoral researcher at Harvard Medical School and CEO of JoVE, told Live Science. \"The reproducibility of published 1 experiments is the foundation of science. No reproducibility - no science.\" https://www.livescience.com/20896-science-scientific-method.html In the instant NP Proposal, data is derived from models created and operated in controlled environments. In the natural world, the number of variables that affect the validity of the data are either too numerous to list, or are simply unknown. Statistical confidence intervals of conclusions in this proposal are not stated, nor are any statistical analyses mentioned (See #5 above). All scientific and technical data must withstand statistical scrutiny. This is meant to address the probability that the data is replicable and applicable in the natural environment or larger population. There is no mention in the NP Proposal of how the models utilized by Stantec were validated, yet numerous assumptions/conclusions regarding the performance parameters of the proposed project are presented. Studies have been published about the validity of utilizing models in ecological studies : \"Because there are no generally agreed validation criteria for ecological models, the best that can be done at present is for the modeller to state explicitly what the validation criteria are and leave it to the user to judge if the criteria are adequate. The most common criteria at present are the \"see how well the simulated data matches the observed data\"... Rykiel, E.J., Jr. \"Testing ecological models: Ecological Modelling 90 (1996) 229-244. Validation criteria are not mentioned in the NP Proposal, based on my own reading. Stantec has included simulated data on many effluent and pipe parameters. However, observed data is not included. For instance, with respect to the receiving environment - the baseline (current) water quality data is assumed to be the same at the outfall location as a previously considered location. This is articulated in the following disclaimer found in Appendix E - Receiving Water Study p. 16: \"No historical water quality data are available for Northumberland Strait around the CH-B location. Data from neighboring Pictou Road (Stantec 2017) located about 6 km southeast were used.\" Two year old data from a location \"about\" 6 km southeast was utilized, and characterized as \"...expected to be worse than off Caribou Point at CH-B...\" This is a significant flaw in the validity of conclusions about the risks inherent in this project. Scientific conclusions cannot be drawn from the modelling data, only hypotheses. This deficiency should be considered pursuant to Section 12 (da) of the Environmental Assessment Regulations . Section 5.6.1 Replacement Effluent ETF Effluent Discharge The NP Proposal provides projected estimated composition of effluent leaving the diffusers at Table 5.5-1. It is then purported that this effluent \"...will meet ambient water quality (current background) at the edge of a standard mixing zone.\" This critical section of the proposal is lacking in detail and does not explain where the extraordinary volume of effluent matter that will be continually exiting the diffusers will go. A fundamental scientific law states: \"The law of conservation of matter or principle of matter conservation states that the mass of an object or collection of objects never changes over time, no matter how the constituent parts rearrange themselves. The mass can neither be created nor destroyed.\" 2 https://www.nuclear-power.net/laws-of-conservation/law-ofconservation-of-matter/ There is one variation in the law of conservation of matter, which is the production of energy in radioactive materials. The basic law of conservation of mass/matter is well known and applies in the fields of chemistry, physics, fluid dynamics etc. The NP Proposal does not adequately address where the effluent mass being delivered at the diffusers will end up once it enters the Northumberland Strait. Every molecule of effluent will remain in the strait/ocean waters unless vaporized into the atmosphere. Table 5.6-1 Anticipated Daily Maximum Effluent Water Quality (Reprinted from Stantec 2018, Table 3.2) 1. The total suspended solids in the effluent are estimated to be 48 mg/L. Using the conservative approach, the mill will be sending 85,000,000 Liters of effluent to the Northumberland Strait every day. This is the equivalent of 4,080 kg/day, or 1,489,200 kg/year of \"suspended solids\" being dumped into the strait. It is further noted that these suspended solids will be comprised of an unknown proportion of floc - biological organic solids, including microbes. Whether floc, sediment, chemical or any other substance, this is an enormous volume of organic and inorganic solid mass entering the Northumberland Strait. If the solids become diluted within an arbitrary \"mixing zone\", then the massive amount of solid organic and inorganic material will simply be present in a more dilute concentration. Given that each year there will be 1,489,200 kg of suspended solids released, the consequences should be addressed by the proponent. This is a serious deficiency in the proposal. This deficiency should be considered pursuant to Sections 12 (c), (d) and (e) of the Environmental Assessment Regulations. 2. The temperature of the effluent leaving the diffusers is estimated to be 25\u00ba C in the winter and 37\u00ba C in the summer. At Appendix E - Table 3.1 Background Water Quality (from Stantec 2017) at the location \"about 6 km southeast\" , the average winter temperature is denoted as 0\u00ba C and average summer temperature as 17.6\u00ba C. Thus, the average effluent to ambient temperature differences would be 25\u00ba C in the winter and 19.4\u00ba C in the summer. Thermal pollution is perhaps the most concerning aspect of this proposed project, in its deleterious effects on organisms and contribution to global warming . A short primer on thermal pollution: Cold water contains more oxygen than hot water so increases in temperature also decrease the oxygen- carrying capacity of water. In addition, raising the water temperature increases the decomposition rate of organic matter in water, which also depletes dissolved oxygen. These decreases in the oxygen content of the water occur at the same time that the metabolic rates of the aquatic organisms, which are dependent on a sufficient oxygen supply, are rising because of the increasing temperature. Ocean invertebrates, fish and marine reptiles are obligate poikilotherms - their body temperatures depend entirely on the surrounding water. Each species is adapted to a single range of temperatures and many pass through several different life stages, each with an individual range of tolerance. The ocean's vast populations of microbes, fungi and sea plants also rely on narrow temperature ranges for optimal growth. 3Thermal pollution often temporarily increases aquatic plant populations. Other life forms, including microbes and animals, move into these regions to exploit the higher oxygen levels, but when photosynthesis stops at night or upon the death of plants, dissolved oxygen levels plummet, leading to massive animal die-offs. Excess heat can also cause unnaturally large microbial blooms, which kill animals by depleting local oxygen or producing toxins. Unnatural warmth and cold can also delay and redirect migration, influence when and whether breeding occurs, and decrease survival of young in marine mammal, reptile and bird populations. Heat pollution that leads to an overabundance of organisms in a region can draw in excessive numbers of creatures that feed on them, while depletion of prey populations by heat stress forces their predators to encroach on regions outside their normal range. Both situations lead to unnatural competition between and within species. A sudden thermal shock can result in mass killings of fish, insects, plants or amphibians. Hotter water may prove favorable for some species while it could be lethal for other species. Small water temperature increases the level of activity while higher temperature decreases the level of activity. Many aquatic species are sensitive to small temperature changes such as one degree Celsius that can cause significant changes in organism metabolism and other adverse cellular biology effects. https://www.slideshare.net/meghamajoe/effect-of-thermal-pollution-on-marine-life This aspect of the proposal should be considered pursuant to Sections 12 (c), (d) and (e) of the Environmental Assessment Regulations. It is unclear whether this EA will consider the effluent contribution to global warming . The gradual warming of the receiving waters within and beyond the arbitrary \"mixing zone\" from hot/warm effluent is not discussed in the NP Proposal. There is a document on the Nova Scotia Environment website at the Environmental Assessment pages titled: \"Guide to considering climate change in environmental assessments in Nova Scotia\". According to this document, Global Warming considerations in the EA include: \"Operational processes and activities can include the project's energy sources and operational boundaries (Guide to Considering Climate Change in Project Development in Nova Scotia Section 2.2, Steps 1 A and 2 A); Anticipated emissions can include information on the processes contributing to GHGs (Section 2.2, Steps 1 A,2 B) and estimated GHG emissions (Section 2.2, Step 2 C); General layout and size can describe the loss of carbon sinks through extent of forest removal (Section 2.2, Step 1 B); and The project's location or setting can be used in relation to a project's climate change vulnerability.\" https://novascotia.ca/nse/ea/docs/EA.Climate.Change.Guide.pdf Table 2-1 Criteria for Assessing Significance of Impacts from Project Activities Operational processes and boundaries include the piping of hot effluent into the marine environment. Thermal pollution and its contribution to global warming are not discussed in the NP Proposal. The contribution to global warming should NOT be glossed over in this assessment. The 1967 mill should not be pushed forward into our collective future without considering the timely and relevant issue of global warming vis-a-vis the thermal pollution that will result from the proposed project. Thermal pollution from the effluent will cause a significant adverse residual environmental effect in its contribution to global warming. 4Section 8.1.3.1. Potential Environmental Effects The following paragraph in its entirety is vague and without any scientific basis. This paragraph should be rewritten to provide clear and detailed information about potential harm from the emissions after the project: \"Without mitigation, the project could interact with the atmospheric environment in the following ways...emissions from the combustion of such sludge in the power boiler during operation and maintenance could disperse from mill stacks to off-site receptors.\" (Registration Document at page 142) The use of \"estimates\" of current emissions at Table 8.1-5 is inadequate. The use of \"estimates\" at Table 8.1-6 is therefore, also unacceptable. Note that the \"estimated\" values are then utilized as baseline in the modeling noted at page 146: \"Ground-level concentrations (GLC's) of air contaminants were predicted for two modeling scenarios...\". The models utilize baseline \"estimates\" to inform the conclusions seen in Table 8.1-7 Summary of residual environmental effects related to the atmospheric environment VEC (page 147). Ultimately, the findings under Significance of Residual Effect are all deemed \"not significant\". The conclusions based upon estimates are not valid or scientific . The conclusions are based on conjecture. Breathtaking in their brevity, and vague, sweeping conclusions, Sections 8.1.3.1 through 8.1.4 should be rewritten to include a scientific basis. The conclusions are based on hypothetical outcomes derived from models. There is simply no rigorous scientific study noted in the proposal to support the assumptions in Sections 8.1.3.1 - 8.1.4. This deficiency should be considered pursuant to Sections 12 (c), (d) and (e) of the Environmental Assessment Regulations. Section 9 Human Health Evaluation As a public health professional, it is impossible to understand why a project of this magnitude and nature would not require a human health risk assessment (HHRA) in an EA. Anecdotally, there have been long suffering health effects in the population in geographic proximity to the Abercrombie pulp mill. The mill emissions are copious and unpredictable as they flow in response to wind velocity and direction. The waters of Boat Harbour are toxic and therefore, the effluent leaving Boat Harbour and going into the Northumberland Strait cannot be innocuous to marine or human life. Morbidity and mortality can be measured and analyzed in a healthcare system such as Nova Scotia's. Reportable disease is recorded and some data is published. However, rates of disease such as cancer in Nova Scotia are published at \"zone level\", which makes it impossible to discern an elevation of disease rates in small geographical locales, or clusters. https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr6208a1.htm My public health practice has been outside of Nova Scotia and so I cannot speak to the reason why the province has failed to study disease rates in Pictou County. I find it unusual that over the long history of the mill's presence, this has not been undertaken. This work is the domain of epidemiologists who utilize data (such as from the Nova Scotia Cancer Registry) and determine if disease rates appear to be elevated and, whether high rates of disease might be associated with the mill emissions and effluent. To the best of my knowledge, this has never been undertaken. 5In the absence of epidemiological studies, it is not possible to dismiss the effects of the mill on human health. Nor is it possible to confirm the effects without delving into epidemiological studies. Unfortunately, this EA is currently proceeding without requirement to review the project's potential future effects on human health. This follows the paucity of attention to health effects from mill emissions and effluent over the last 51 years. This is an unjust burden upon the people of Pictou County. In any case, the information in Section 9 has no application in this EA in the absence of any historical epidemiological data. Any future epidemiological study would obviously take many months or years. If human health were deemed relevant to this undertaking, the matter should be considered pursuant to The Environment Act, Section 34 (1) (b). 6From: Environment To: Environment Assessment Web Account Subject: Proposed Project Comments Date: February 26, Web Account Subject: Proposed Date: February 26, 2019 1:24:25 PM Project: replacement_effluent_treatment_facility_project Comments: I do not approve of pumping treated effluent into the Northumberland Strait. no proof that the effluent will not beharmful to the surrounding waters especially with the temperature it is being quoted at.

Name: Assessment Web Account Subject: Proposed Project Date: February 26, 2019 5:04:37 PM Project: replacement_effluent_treatment_facility_project Comments: Northern Pulp effluent treatment facility as proposed February 2019. Volume of waste water effluent 82,500 cubicmeters/day is 57,300 litres per minute, system maximum. 70,000 cubic meters/day is 48,600litres per minute, the rate which is most commonly created during the normal operationswhich the plant manager reported to me in conversation. Please note: the volume of one cubicmeter is 1000 Litres The Northern Pulp proposed average daily waste water is projected to be62,000 cubic meters per day of effluent, which is a rate of 43,056 litres per minute and is also717 Litres per second. The volume of liquid waste from the the Northern Pulp Mill isextremely high. The upper maximum waste effluent suggested by Northern Pulp Nova Scotiais a volume of 82,500 cubic meters of effluent, this is 954.8 Litres per second to enter theenvironment. The current effluent temperature from Mill production to the Boat HarbourEffluent Treatment Facility is at 40- 42 degrees Celsius. There is no known heat loss for thecurrent pipeline although it is likely more than a kilometre in length. However, the flow rateand the polyethylene piping may prevent heat loss while the Mill is in steady stateoperations/production. A 1,000,000 L one million litre storage tank may have the capacity tostore Northern Pulp liquid waste effluent for 17.4 minutes /- 1 minute when productiongenerates 57,300 L/minute effluent per day. At 40,000 L/minute of NP liquid waste effluent,fills a 1,000,000 L storage tank within 25 minutes /- 1minute, assuming it was empty at beforehand. An 11.4 km pipeline which is 36 inches inside diameter will contain 7,479 cubic metersof waste effluent, or approximately 7.5 million litres of effluent should a catasrophic pipefailure occur. This environmental risk is significant, given the communities have noexperience with large effluent pipeline failure. The 7.5 million litres of effluent does notinclude headwater effluents that would continue to be pumped or gravity fed from the millshould the transmission pipeline fail. The proposed 12 million litre clarifiers have a maximumfour hour capacity to treat the effluent. The current Boat Harbour Effluent System hasapproximately seven to ten days by comparison. The open clarifiers will pose a verysignificant occupational health risk to Northern Pulp Mill workers/employees. The dailyexposure limit to hydrogen sulphide H2S is less than 1 part per million ppm. The threeclarifiers will off-gas hydrogen sulphide from 5 to 50 ppm depending upon winds. Hydrogensulphide toxicity is not well addressed given labour regulations. This one gas can bepotentially deadly as 100 ppm H2S with be fatal within 30 seconds to adult humans. ClarifiersThe primary stage clarifier may remove 2.3 grams of suspended solids per litre of waste waterwith an on-going rate of only 0.3 grams per litre clarification as stated. Turbulent flows by the700 to 950 Litres/second inbound waste waters into the clarifiers will negatively impactsettling, raking or screening actions of the on-going success in the clarifier systems. Clarifierswork best with a calm steady state fluid, where there is little turbulence and there are days forsolids to fall from mechanical suspensions or have time to settle gradually due to differencesin specific gravity. Little discussion is made of wood fibres and the inorganic composition ofthe effluent water waters. The process chemicals in a Kraft pulp digestion process are mainlyand potentially all water soluble. Settling in the clarifier is difficult, to say the least. The wastewood fibres lost in the waste waters will float due to their specific gravity. The first stageclarifier does not describe any wood fibre retention or extraction, nor the capture of watersoluble chemicals. The proposed clarifier is designed to capture only dense total solids whichmay or may not settle out in the very turbulent clarifier environment. Waste matter from theclarifiers will be diverted to a sludge tank and ultimately to the Power Boiler para 5.2.2.8. The text as presented is misleading. It suggests: Pressed sludge/solids containing water will be combusted in the power boiler to produce heat. The text should state any water component of the waste sludge is totally released to the atmosphere along with the soluble contaminants.While the power boiler, produces stream and electricity, any moisture in the combustionchamber can only exit via the chimney and into the atmosphere of Pictou County. Should thissame moisture contain soluble sulphites, sulphides and related process chemicals, these will allbe made airborne by the combustion process. Please also note: The combustion/power boiler isthe least equipped for pollution abatement. Marine Pollution at Caribou Harbour The CaribouHarbour opening suggested for the effluent diffuser is adjacent to Northumberland Ferryvessel route. This means the visitors to Nova Scotia or leaving the Province via the ferryservice will be subjected to high concentrations of sulfur dioxide gases and related sulfuroxides arising from the effluent diffuser. The effluent water exiting the proposed diffuserapparatus with be toxic to marine life. With respect to ferry users, the effluent is fresh water,hot and very gasified. This will result in the effluent rising to the surface of theNorthumberland Strait water immediately. The notion that these waters will mix uniformly bynatural blending is misleading. The differences in temperature and specific gravity will causethe effluent to create a continuous rift pattern which will prevent wishful mixing/blending assuggested by Northern Pulp. The analogy is higher industrial chimneys from factories werethought to better diffuse airborne pollution. Scientists and engineers now know this does notoccur in fact. The proposed position of the effluent diffuser is immediately upstream of theCaribou Provincial Park, the Pictou Lodge and across the harbour from the Pictou LandingFirst Nations lands. As the Northumberland Strait tides fall twice daily the Northern Pulpeffluent will be mixing and flowing toward these locations. The smell of oxides of sulphur,sulphur dioxide, hydrogen sulphide and related kraft pulp wastes will greatly impact breaches,the nasty odour of the sulphur complexes will cause undue respiratory stress for humans andother mammals on, in or adjacent to the Northumberland Strait. Marine Habitat 717-949 litresof Northern Pulp\u00e2?Ts liquid effluent will enter the Northumberland Strait per second. TheBiological Oxygen Demand BOD, the pH and maybe physical attributes, will have beenpretested by routine daily compliance measures. The BOD usually laboratory test requires atleast an hour of lab time to perform the testing. Stopping production because of a failure ofBOD testing will not happen due to the safely to the workers and the plant processes this plantmust slowly be shut down which would fail the three hour available for the decision.Compliance issues will be next to impossible to evaluate as the waste water will be entering asaltwater environment, well below the surface waters. 717-949 litres of very hot water persecond will be entering the Northumberland Strait. The huge temperature variation comparedwith receiving waters by some 25 to 35 degrees Celsius will be lethal to marine life. NorthernPulp Management suggest they expect this lethal impact to be spread over an area of 100meters/any direction from each diffuser. However tidal action, thermal rifts and the specificgravity differences will cause the warmer waste waters to rise immediately, having a largerimpact on fish and marine mammals. The inorganic waste chemicals from the NP Mill\u00e2?Tsoperations, will impact benthic shellfish life. The nasty odours and the chemical/physicalpollution will negatively impact tourism, recreational land use and the fisheries. Little workhas been done to accurately quantify waste metals from the Mill\u00e2?Ts current operation. Thequantities of iron, nickel, chromium, molybdenum and other ingredients within stainless steeland chromium plated steel roller surfaces have left an impact in Boat Harbour. Havingsampled the embankment soils and having had a third party test laboratory analyze the soilsamples, there was a noticeable trend within Boat Harbour. Inorganic heavy metals haveoccurred and entered into Boat Harbour since the Mill was built in 1967. These metalcontaminants are likely from eroded stainless steel, worn pipes, worn roller surfaces, etc.. that50 years of operations has lead to chronic heavy metal waste/pollution. Should Northern Pulpand this kraft pulp process operate for another 25 years or more, the inorganic metals pollution needs to be addressed as part of current evaluation. The lead, tin, antimony, cadmium from bushing/metal bearings, chromium from hard electroplated chro mium rollers,chromium/nickel/iron/molybdenum from stainless steel piping, cadmium plated bolts andfasteners, all these metal suffer daily erosion, corrosion and cavitation which will impact theNorthumberland Strait lobster fishery. The oxides of sulfur, the changes in salinity, watertemperature, turbidity will impact fish habitat and the migration of fish stocks within theStrait. Northern Pulp\u00e2?Ts Environmental History Paper Excellence and Northern Pulp NovaScotia operated the kraft pulp mill without an electrostatic preceptor for more than a yearwithout reporting its failure to the community or its regulator. Northern Pulp\u00e2?Ts PowerBoiler has failed emissions testing. The Northern Pulp\u00e2?Ts Recovery Boiler failed emissionstesting. Regardless of failed airborne pollution testing, the Mill operations continued untilappropriate shutdowns could be scheduled well after directions/Minister\u00e2?Ts Orders weregiven to the Mill management. The proposed size of the first and second stage clarifiers andthe \u00e2?oBAS technology may appear interesting to the environmental assessment decisionmakers. However, there is only a four hour residency of waste waters to remain in holdingtank system. However with waste waters of 700 - 950 litres per second entering each of thefirst and second stage clarifiers, this flow rate will cause extreme turbulence. The magnitudeof the waste water flow rate limits the capacity of the clarifiers. Furthermore the off-gasing ofhydrogen sulphide from the clarifiers will create a process that is difficult to understand andcontrol as well as potentially deadly to workers exposed to the open clarifiers. Sedimentationas described by the proposal within the clarifier system will not meet current standards. Therecent Mill Management, while perhaps willing to invest in operator training, most likely willunder resource this waste treatment system, as previously demonstrated. The waste treatmentproposal only addresses the BOD/COD, pH attributes of the waste waters. The off-gasingfrom sulphites/sulphides/oxides of sulphur, wear metals, inorganic chemical iron, nickel,chromium, cadmium, sodium sulphide, sodium sulphates pollution, and the huge thermalpollution issues are not addressed by the proposed plan of action. The high densitypolyethylene or polypropylene piping system to transport the waste water effluent to the finalmarine site will effectively insulate the waste waters and prevent heat loss. The daily loss of62,000,000 to 82,500,000 litres of hot water 35 to 40 degree Celsius into the environment is \u00e2?ocriminal. Conclusions: 1. The proposed effluent treatment system is under sized for theclarifiers and the current daily water volumes. 2. Once effluents have passed the clarifiersystem, there is little opportunity for subsequent remediation should BOD testing indicate anissue. BOD testing, requiring an hour to complete, provides only three hours to stopproduction of the mill. 3. Waste effluent at 35 degrees or more will enter the NorthumberlandStrait killing marine life. The projected waste path does not accurately address the thermaltoxicity to marine life, the foul smelling oxides of sulphur by-products, chronic heavy metalcontamination by the effluents. 4. The waste waters are out of visual sight of the Mill, itsresponse teams and could have days of non-compliant waste disposal before regulatoryprocesses would require immediate shutdown of the proposed waste treatment system. Thiswould be at the expense of fishermen, marine life and a valuable coastal zone area for tourists,residents and endangered marine mammals. Lastly 5. An Industrial Approval should not beconsidered but the Province of Nova Scotia for the continuing operations of Northern PulpNova Scotia Limited the Mill until the Mill replaces the existing kraft caustic digestiontechnology and implements a closed loop water pulping process such that there is little or nowaste management issue, no need to dump waste process chemicals and spent waters into themarine environment of Pictou County, the Pictou Landing First Nations or the Strait Sincerely, Web Account Subject: Proposed Date: February 26, 2019 11:18:55 PM Project: replacement_effluent_treatment_facility_project Comments: Shut down the Mill #NOPIPE 300 jobs at the mill compared to thousands of jobs by the fishermen/fisherwomenand the sport fishing industry.

Lets do Name: Assessment Web Account Subject: Proposed Project Date: February 27, 2019 11:20:39 AM Project: replacement_effluent_treatment_facility_project Comments: As residents of Pictou County wed like to address the serious issue affecting the local area and the broader provinceof NS in regards to the proposed Effluent Treatment Facility project put forth by NorthernPulp We feel confident that NP has carefully prepared, planned, studied in depth material forthe proposal and the tests that they\u00e2?Tve been undergoing the past five years to meetenvironmental regulations, requirements, and scrutiny set forth by the province of NS to moveforward with construction. Today we all are concerned about the various effects on ourenvironment and have become skeptical of false truths passed on throughout the years that hasmade us very guarded. We strongly believe with all the studies, tests, preparations that thiscompany has done, and millions of dollars spent since purchasing the mill that theirseriousness, commitment to the project, and willingness to continually improve on this millsince becoming owners shows their dedicatio n in making the future of this mill and itseffluent outfall one of present day\u00e2?Ts highest in technology. A five year deadline was setforth by government for the closure of Boat Hbr and timeline for NP to complete everythingnecessary to pass an environmental assessment, in essence this may have seemed ample timeto achieve all crossed T\u00e2?Ts and dotted I\u00e2?Ts but with all considered the company was metwith challenges from government with continued added criteria and challenges of interferencewhen trying to fulfil the necessary studies to gather that information. There are many who arenot in favour of an extension to Boat Hbr, and we all agree that a clean-up is necessary,effluent has been treated this way for fifty years and facts tell us that some of the best catchesfor fishers over the years have not been affected, an extension may be necessary for NP tocomplete scientific crucial detail for the effluent project they propose for continued operationof NP, and I hop e government, local groups, and community give consideration into a shortterm extension if needed. Very concerning is the fact that there are individuals and groupslocally non-local on a crusade to shut down NP permanently regardless of the outcome ofscientific tests results. It\u00e2?Ts ironic to hear comments coming from the government of PEIregarding our effluent when facts tell us that over 90 of nitrates in our strait comes from thatprovince and as well the outfall from other industry waste water from towns travel through ourrivers including Pictou\u00e2?Ts to the Northumberland Strait. Our communities, neighbours,families, etc. have become divided in conflict due to lack of leadership within our boundariesof Pic.Co. N.S., political parties blaming each other, or anyone, when it was they all politicalparties who voted for a deadline, instead of the blame game they should be coming togetherfor viable solutions resolution. There is a real concern for the many jobs in PC, rural NS, theentire province, and the more than 500 retirees of the pulp mill whose benefits and pensionsmay be impacted and disheartening to think about the many young families presentlyemployed by NP and forestry who would undoubtedly have to leave our county and provincein search of employment elsewhere to support their families and further jeopardize an alreadydeclining population and decreasing property value of land and homes in our county as well asthe negative effect on business locally and provincially.

I am nine years old from Central Caribou , NS. Please do not dismiss my letter because of my age. I have grown up on the beaches of Caribou and my cottage on Pictou Island. I have fished lobster with my grandfather and father every spring since I was four. My Great-grandfather, grandfather and fat her have all fished the same Pictou Island grounds that I would like to fish someday. Kids like Greta Thunberg are making grownups take climate change serious , if she can do that maybe I can do the same with this pipe idea, because it is serious, seriously bad. I a m asking you to not allow Northern Pulp to put their pipe in our ocean. It will make all the marine life swim away. People around the world are making changes and working to stop pollution, why would we allow this to happen to our beautiful beaches, to the animals and fish that live in the Northumberland Strait. We need to think forward not backwards. In 4H I am doing a project on Sustainable Fishing Practices in Nova Scotia. While doing my project I have found lots of examples of f ishermen, sci entists and First Nations working together and com ing up with ideas so there are still fish in the ocean in the future. Destroying their marine habitat with brown, hot, smelly water is not sustainable. When I was at marine biology camp we did an experimen t with oil on a feather and used Dawn soap to try and get it off like in the commerc ials. It was hard to get any of the oil off and in the end we weren' t able to get it all. We were learning about a spill, an accident, this pipe will be pumping an unimaginable amount of pollution on purpose everyday into the ocean. This experiment also made me think about the Dawn commercial, using hurt ducks to sell their soap and it made me mad. I have to listen to Northern Pulp commercials everyday telling me how great t hey are, but just because it is in a commercial does not make it true. In sc hool we talk about not littering, reduce, reuse and recycle. We learn about pollution and what we can do to help the Earth, but we are not allowed to talk about Northern Pulp even though some days when the wind is blowing the smog toward our school we have to play inside because the air hurts to breathe and it smells worse than dog farts. If you allow them to build their new system it will be burning sludge on top of what they burn now, it will be worse. If you have ever played on a beach, ate seafood, enjoyed your day on a boat I want you to think about that when you make your decision, think about that and think about a nine year old in Caribou NS staring out at a new Boat Harbour.

This system hasbeen proven to work in other parts of the world with great success! I support this projec!Name: Assessment Web Account Subject: Proposed Project Date: February 28, 2019 3:51:15 AM Project: replacement_effluent_treatment_facility_project Comments: I was born in Pictou and left in 1994, but still visit several times every year. I have spent many summers growing up on our Northumberland Strait beaches and lots of time onboard a fishing boat hauling in our lucrative lobster, scallop and herring catches as well as snow crab and tunafurther down the shores. It is bad enough with the air pollution this pulp mill emits, with itsfaulty and outdated equipment, but now they want to continue to pollute our waters, so myfocus will be on this aspect. There is a certain beauty out on the open water of ourNorthumberland Strait, which cannot be underestimated as to how long that could quicklydisappear with such a waste proposal put forth by Northern Pulp. I am well informed onNorthern Pulp and its predecessors\u00e2?T operations at Abercrombie Point, but more importantlyBoat Harbor. The deceit which has taken place for over 50 years by our own government andthe many pulp mill owners including NP, needs to come to a halt in January 2020. The Pictouand surrounding communities, especially Pictou Landing First Nation, need time to heal andrecover from this worst case of environmental racism in Canadian history. To even considerputting a fresh water toxic effluent pipe from an outdated, broken down pulp mill, at themouth of Caribou Harbor, which would run over water-sheds for drinking water to get there,and then into salt-water fishing / spawning grounds makes no sense at all in this day and age. Iwill not forget to mention this area is adjacent to Caribou - Munroe\u00e2?Ts Island ProvincialBeach Park, which locals and tourists visit on a regular basis, our very own historic PictouLodge and Waterside Beach. Also add our beautiful Pictou waterfront in the mix, and I just donot see any logic with wanting to jeopardize parts of Canada\u00e2?Ts Ocean Playground in favorof a foreign entity who has no real interest in long-term investment for our Province. If theydid, there would have been other options available over the years to either change their pulpprocess or close the effluent loop, which we all know they can! It will be costly, but is therereally a price on people\u00e2?Ts health a nd lives with the way this pulp mill is running now?? Tonot do it, or provide a more environmentally friendly option, shows their level of commitmentbecause from my understanding the only reason seems to be the almighty dollar! And that istheir profit loss! Who needs bleached toilet paper and kleenex tissues nowadays when weknow what is coming from this type of pulp-mill effluent process and into our air / waters?The further concerns I have are that Northern Pulp cannot even say what this discharge of so-called treated effluent will contain. What is the chemical composition and how much solids gowith this daily discharge?? How can they not be 100 certain on this now but expect us toapprove of their weak proposal to discharge it?? Are we seriously thinking pumping up to 60-90 million liters of heated fresh water into a salt-water environment will not do irreparableharm to our fisheries and aquatic lifestyle?? Where is the 1 ton of expected solids going to go,let alone the plume of effluent in our waterway? Dilution is simply not the solution topollution nowadays. It is a known fact already that our oceans and waters are warming up atan alarming rate, and it is affecting marine life, so why does our Province want to contribute towhat will be an ongoing daily activity?? Also, this is not new state of the art technology,regardless of what Northern Pulp wants to say. How this proposal went for Federal reviewsalready, but not this time around, further baffles me. What has changed from the last time thisproposal was rejected due to suspected harm to our very important fishing industry, as well theenvironmental damage to our waters and coastline we have already witnessed and need toclean up now at the taxpayers expense? Furthermore, and it also came from your own dept,and regardless of what NP says again, this toxic effluent has NOT been pumped into the Northumberland Strait for over 50 years! It is not heated fresh water, with solids going directly into OUR Strait. It has time to settle and cool in the Boat Harbour lagoons, before being released into the Strait. There is a dead zone around this discharge pipe as well, where thereceiving waters look like Root Beer. So maybe we want to visit Boat Harbor once more inorder to see what our tourists travelling on the Northumberland Ferries just might end upseeing. Surely they will want to get right off the ferry and go down and buy some lobsters offour local fishing boats, which I have seen so many do, and then continue their journey toCaribou Beach or Pictou Lodge and jump in the water\u00e2?\u00a6\u00e2?\u00a6Sorry for the sarcasm but it is avery realistic possibility our Strait will look like Boat Harbor and I would hate to see theoutcome once it does . In closing, Boat Harbor needs to shut down in January 2020, and if stillrequired this effluent proposal should go to go to a Federal Assessment, where our ownFisheries Dept. and scientists etc. can assess it instead of NP\u00e2?Ts paid scientists. Thanks foryour time in this very important matter to our communities, but more importantly ourenvironment and the future of our children / To: Environment Assessment Web Account Subject: Response comments to Northern Pulp EA Registration document Date: February 28, 2019 1:11:31 PM Attachments: Northern Pulp response comments.pdf Hello, Attached please find my letter containing thoughts and comments to this recent application for assessment approval by Northern Pulp Nova Scotia Corporation.I believe in the interest of saving and conserving on paper product use, e-mailing thedocument would be a preferred method of communication. Thank you very much for your favourable consideration in this regard, Response to Northern Pulp Nova Scotia Corporation EA February 28, 2019 Dear esteemed protectors of Nova Scotia, This Northern Pulp Nova Scotia (NPNS) Environmental Assessment Registration Document totals 1698 pages, including those in the 14 Appendices. The public has a minimal 30 day window of opportunity to read, research and respond to this overwhelmingly-lengthy report. To recognize that the provincial taxes I trustingly pay are used to grant Northern Pulp funds, from the sweat of my labour, to use and abuse in this manner, is extremely disheartening. Please invest my money in providing exemplary health care services for all Nova Scotia residents instead. NPNS's prepared EA report is guilty of using repetitive jargon as a red herring to cover up hypocrisy throughout. That is interpreted to be an intentionally intimidating waste of time - mine and yours! Pertinent information stated well the first time would be adequately convincing. What is not being said, deceitfully hidden within this vast maze of hedged wording, is factually the most relevant and potentially frightening. When that many words are deemed necessary to describe a project, common sense would dictate it is nothing more than an elaborate fast talking scheme to sell an idea they also know is terrible. If this project had actual feasibility and merit, these words would not have to work so hard to sell it. What experience credentials does this company actually have for a project construction of this magnitude? This mill's parent company usually takes over existing mills already in operation do they not? What they are proposing will waste a colossal amount of money if attempts fail. It will take at least 3 to 4 years, if not 5 or 6 years (given their procrastination tendencies) to complete during the weather-dependant working months offered by our Maritime climate. Have they addressed the risk for project interference with the Bell Aliant fibre optic telecommunications submarine cable running from Caribou to Wood Islands, PEI? Telecommunications is a lucrative industry for Nova Scotia. Northumberland Strait waters are relatively shallow depths. Is there adequate volume to use this disposal at sea method? Disposal at sea is prohibited without a permit issued by the Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) Disposal at Sea Program under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (CEPA). Pulp and paper effluent wastewater is not listed in the applicable substances list on Schedule 5 of CEPA for eligible consideration.Without appropriate depth, would effluent waste debris of significant proportions continually rise to the water surface, washing inland with each rising tide and winter ice? Nova Scotia, Canada's Ocean Playground, is surrounded by more than 7,500 kms of ocean coastline. Anywhere in the province you are never more than 56 kms or an hour's drive from ocean access. \u00001Response to Northern Pulp Nova Scotia Corporation EA Promoting environmental protection from pollution for these coastal water resources is crucial as sea levels steadily rise each year. Compromising the vulnerable integrity of Northumberland Strait waters and coastline with pulp and paper mill effluent wastewater containing unspecified chemicals of potential concern (COPCs) would prove to be fateful. I've selected a couple of section details to comment on. I hope these will serve to convey my grave concerns about this entire matter. Also included is an article researched from the Pulp and Paper Canada Newsletter website: Table 1.1-1: List of PIDs Involved in the Proposed Project Federal agency approval will be necessary for use of the four outlined properties belonging to Her Majesty the Queen (Canada). Risk of jeopardizing an entire marine environment in the Northumberland Strait will warrant conscientious federal consideration under the CEPA. Basin Head on the eastern end of PEI is a federal Marine Protected Area (MPA). It is highly plausible to expect large volumes of industrial contaminants, with COPC characteristics, released daily from adjacent NS shorelines will affect the unique ecosystem of that MPA. Section 9.0 Human Health Evaluation Preface [paragraph 2]...Health Canada clearly communicated their position that a human health risk assessment (HHRA) of the project would need to be considered NPNS states an HHRA is not needed unless specified as a condition once approval has been signed. Statistics are quoted from an HHRA prepared for a pulp mill proposal located in Tasmania on the other side of the equator? It bears noting, that mill never received approval to operate due to environmental concerns. There are bound to be significant differences between health challenges faced in that Eastern Hemisphere country than we experience here in the Northern Hemisphere. For instance, Tasmania claims to have the cleanest air in the world. Not exactly something Pictou and surrounding counties can boast with ongoing problematic putrid emissions from this aged pulp mill. I believe NPNS shows serious contempt for all public health and well-being, not only of local, provincial or even federal consumers but that of every international seafood consumer as well. Potential for industrial activities to also impact global health warrants mandatory federal health agency involvement. Popular Nova Scotia seafood is a multi-billion dollar commercial export industry. But do you recall how one mad cow incident in Western Canada shut down all international borders for Canadian beef exports? One contaminated lobster from Nova Scotia could very well cause an international crash for all Nova Scotia provincial seafood markets - not just those located in Pictou County. \u00002Response to Northern Pulp Nova Scotia Corporation EA 9.1 Introduction and Background [paragraph 3] At this time, effluent chemistry characteristics (including the specic substances present in treated effluent and their anticipated concentrations) will not be known with certainty until the project is operational. 9.1.1 Canada Health Consultation [paragraph 1; bullet ix] Including a reasonably well dened characterization of likely effluent chemistry that represents a conservative prediction of the chemicals that may be present in effluent discharge. [paragraph 3] With respect to item ix above, there remains uncertainty at this time regarding the specic chemical parameters that will be present in the project's treated effluent (and their concentrations). 9.2.4.2 Identication of Candidate COPCs in Treated Mill Euent [paragraph 3] Due to uncertainty regarding effluent composition and approximate concentrations of substances present in the future treated effluent (which will not be veried until the project is operational) Evident throughout this entire document, the repetitive phrase, \"until the project is operational \" reads similar to a blackmail extortion attempt........NPNS is essentially saying, \"sign over approval for us to operate before we will release the identity of the chemicals that will be present.\" They are literally holding human health hostage! It is disappointing not to see compiled data of accurate chemical identification from Northern Pulp scientists and chemists that presumably would be employed on site and responsible for daily monitoring of this effluent treatment system. Working with toxic substances used in this pulping process, they should be able to knowledgeably provide the characteristics for these COPCs. Why outsource that necessary information from other mills and outside agencies? How can they claim uncertainty about something they've certainly been creating and using for years? Section 14.0 Assessment Summary and Conclusion [paragraph 2] The continued operation of the NPNS mill is essential to meet global market demands........ A quick Google search of pulp and paper mills, just in Canada alone, indicates a total of at least 30 mills. Social sourcing for renewable sustainable products is trending for conscientious consumers concerned about the devastating environmental impacts these mills create. There will be better, more earth-friendly products sourced, produced and manufactured in the very near future. A smart investor would be encouraged to give serious consideration to those long-range plans rather than continuing to provide huge financial crutches for this aged mill to keep limping along on. If the global market has the high demand they claim, why is NP not able to generate enough revenue to support their own projects? Perhaps there is already too much competition within this sector of the business market? \u00003Response to Northern Pulp Nova Scotia Corporation EA https://www.pulpandpapercanada.com/news/feds-provide-update-on-forthcoming-pulp-and-paper- euent-regulations-1100001557 { Pulp and EA sections and the Pulp and Paper Canada article: Does NPNS have ulterior motive for attempting to fast track this project in advance of new Canadian pollution regulations coming into effect? Is it possible NPNS will qualify to claim exemption from these new regulations if the construction process receives conditional approval and begins prior to these regulations coming into effect? Is your Department confident any effluent treatment system financially invested in now will have the capabilities to handle these future stringent federal standards? Or will N.S. taxpayer funds be drained yet again for costly future upgrades to technology installed now that does not meet those revised standards? Do these new technologies referred to actually require more caustic chemical compounds which affect the effluent makeup? In this EA, consultants frequently weave the phrase \"uncertainty regarding effluent chemistry characteristics\" throughout the daunting web of word entanglements. Would that expressed lack of conclusive information by a company who has been in this industry for so long be cause for questionable concern within your department? Is it deemed professionally acceptable in the pulp and paper industry to withhold revealing accurate effluent chemistry characteristics to environment government officials? Would that be deemed acceptable practice by N.S. environmental laws and regulations? Is it conceivable that NPNS is deliberately stalling or withholding facts on correctly identifying these effluent chemical characteristics in order to be able to claim compliance - only after they know what the new acceptable Canadian standards are going to be? Deemed a highly suspicious and contentious practice. Would common sense and logic dictate that astute financial investors, like the Nova Scotia government, adopt a practical approach of first determining what the pollution limitation guidelines are going to be before sinking further taxpayer monies into an environmentally sensitive project of this magnitude? \u00004Response to Northern Pulp Nova Scotia Corporation EA How long must we, the taxpayers, be expected to keep throwing good money after bad into this aged pulp and paper mill that long ago ceased to be an environmentally-conscious asset by Canadian federal standards? Again, I ask that my taxes be used to provide exemplary health care services for all Nova Scotia residents instead. The pulp and paper industry is a highly competitive market - human health care should not be! How many mill jobs will actually be phased out and eliminated after being replaced by upgraded modern technology? At the expense of many, I believe, NPNS is seeking permission to wash away any and all industrial waste woes to sea solely for their own corporate economic convenience and advancement. I fear this metaphorical Pandora's Box pipeline carrying effluent wastewater will unleash residual effects into the Northumberland Strait that can never be reined back in. Irreparable and irreversible damage will wreak havoc in Canadian waters. Hope was the only remaining symbolism left in Pandora's box before it closed. Thus, it is my fervent hope lessons learned from using Boat Harbour for effluent treatment and the subsequent catastrophic effects will not be in vain when that facility is shut down on January 31, 2020. In closing, I offer this trademark quote printed in each issue of SALTSCAPES magazine: \"Some would make us just names on a list. But we are people in a place - and resist.\" Respectfully submitted, \u00005 From: @hotmail.com To: Environment Assessment Web Account Subject: Proposed Date: February 28, 2019 9:34:38 PM Project: replacement_effluent_treatment_facility_project Comments: We as residents of Pictou County, living in New Glasgow and owning property along the Northumberland Strait,have the following concerns re the proposed Northern Pulp waste solution for its effluent thatcurrently goes into Boat Harbour. Pumping the effluent into the Northumberland Strait is anenvironmental time bomb with no possible method of containment or cleanup. We need tohave buy in from N,S. , PEI, N.B. and Quebec, as the waters of the Northumberland Strait andthe Gulf of Saint Lawrence affect us all. The fishermen of all of these provinces will beaffected if there is a consumer backlash against fish being marketed from polluted waters. Thisindustry is worth millions of dollars and is a federal responsibility. The fact that our Nativenations are affected, as well as the fisheries and many provinces, should make the case thatthis situation calls for a full federal government environmental assessment. Tourism will befurther affected as we already have seen the impact on the town of Pictou with the existingsmell from the Northern Pulp plant with the impact of the discharge location near the CaribouFerry Terminal connecting us with Prince Edward Island. This terminal is a major tourismentry point into our county of Pictou. Who will be excited to go into the waters to swim,kayak,etc around this area when they know that possibly there could be pollution from a pulpmill in the water? This proposal will affect tourism. The visibility of such a pipe along thePictou causeway or anywhere along the Trans Canada Highway connector to the CaribouFerry Terminal will be a clear negative to our tourism image. Our tourism industry is worthmillions of dollars. There is no guarantee that a waste pipe going alongside the PictouCauseway will not be punctured at some point due to a car or transport truck leaving the road.If punctured, Pictou Harbour will be affected and there is no containment possibility. Otherpoints that are of concern to us from the Northern Pulp proposal are as follows: The wasteproposal poses major risk to harming marine life , marine habitat, species atrisk/endangered/threatened that include migratory and marine birds, fish, vegetation, reptilesetc. The proposal goes through the Pictou town and Caribou water supply. A provincial parkand a nature preserve are within the effluent pipe footprint Meeting Pulp and Paper EffluentRegulations PPER doesn\u00e2?Tt prevent harm to marine life or marine habitat per EnvironmentCanada. The chemical characteristics of the proposed effluent is \u00e2?ounknown\u00e2? to NorthernPulp. The proposal shows the plan to burn the toxic sludge in the power boiler. Air emissionsare an issue today and health issues are already known to be above provincial averages todayin Pictou County. The proposed spill basin on the plant site is planned to only hold 35 millionlitres of untreated effluent which is only 10-12 hrs of plant operation before it goes into thedownstream system. If a malfunction happens where does the excess go? The proposal alsolists temporary and permanent closures for fishermen around the outflow area and to create ano anchor zone. The proposed O2 delignification system is not laid out regarding how or whenit will be constructed or maintained. It is listed in the appendix of the proposal as a \u00e2?ofutureupgrade\u00e2? . This should have to be defined now and not in the future. The Waste proposalwill be pumping effluent into the ocean after only processing it for 8 hours as opposed to thecurrent waste system that takes about 30 days to process and reach the Strait. The Nova Scotiaprovincial government has many conflicts of interest going back decades between itself andthe mill and should not be involved in the environmental assessment and theapproval/rejection of a Boat Harbour Effluent Treatment Replacement Solution. We wouldlike all of these points to be considered and strongly suggest that a Federal EnvironmentalAssessment is necessary. Minister of Environment I am writing this letter concerning the Northern Pulp Environmental Assessment on replacing the effluent pipe. My name is _, I'm a fourth generation commercial fishermen and have owned my own fishing enterprise since 10 years .I strongly object to this project , the release of up to 90 million liters of effluent into any body of water is un-acceptable I The chemicals and the freshwater being released into salt water will cause adverse effects on the marine environment an on all fish stocks in the area that can Not be mitigated In closing I urge you to REJECT this project ! !!

Thereshould be an extension given for the use of Boat Harbour. The way I look at it is why shut theforestry sector down when the present owners of Northern Pulp are committed to the project.If the effluent line cannot go where the assessment wants it to go there should be an extensiongranted until a discharge place is found. It would be foolish to shut down the forestry sector.This project is a massive undertaking and if the government was doing it, it would take waymore than 5 years to complete. Actually Northern Pulp and the government took the first yearplus just to hammer out the industrial approval that Northern Pulp could operate under. Hasthere been any effects elsewhere where discharge lines enter waterways. Will all Federal andProvincial Regulations be met. Why am I so concerned:1 I have and still am working in theforest industry for 30 years:2 My brother has and still is working in the forest industry for 35years:3 My father worked and actually still does part time for 40 years:4 Many friends andother relatives work in both the forestry and fishing sectors:5 We raised and are raising ourfamilies here and dont want to leave:6 We work full time and pay taxes to support the socialsystem. This must be based on science not Fear mongering and Here say and Northern Pulpmust be given the chance to proceed with this project without any interference of anypartiesfishermen Blockading this just puts projects behind. My final note is that if NorthernPulp closes the Nova Scotia economy with be devastated. Many people will move away. Thisisnt just the workers in the sector. This means families as well. I just hope everyone will worktogether for the better of Nova Scotia. Thank You. Name: Assessment Web Account Subject: Proposed Project Date: March 1, 2019 8:54:43 PM Project: replacement_effluent_treatment_facility_project Comments: This treatment facility is the same as the most modern facility used at many mills in both Canada and the USA.Diffusing the treatment wastewater this is more correct then affluent as once chemicals areremoved there are only the mineral residues from wood which occur naturally left into themassive water body of the Northumland Strait and the current flow there will disperse thewastewater and dilute it and make the effect marginalized almost immediately. This is a goodsystem and proven treatment facility and pipeline method that should be approved byDepartment of Environment. Class 1 EA is appropriate as this is a replacement of an existingsystem in an existing facility. Name: Assessment Web Account Subject: Proposed Project Date: March 1, 2019 9:24:24 PM Project: replacement_effluent_treatment_facility_project Comments: This project must be approved. This needs to happen for the sustainment of rural life in Nova Scotia. The NIMBYeffect in NS is decimating rural life and eliminating resource jobs that provide quality pay anda good standard of living. The products that you use everyday are either farmed or come fromthe ground. Why do Canadians feel that we are so privileged that we don\u00e2?Tt require theresource industries that supply us with everyday items? That just leads to a shift in resourceextraction to poorer countries with less than adequate environmental and safety standards thatare truly putting people at risk. Canada has some of the highest environmental standards in theworld. We should be proud of our resource industries, not trying to end it.

I have lived in Pictou, Nova Scotia my entire life. I am writing to explain why there should be an expansion for the effluent treatment plan for Northern Pulp. My dad is a dedicated employee at Northern Pulp and he has workedthere for the past ten years. His job at Northern Pulp was and still is our primary incomewithin our household. A large amount of funding for my university program and living hascome from my fathers income. My first year of university costed our family over . Itscares me to hear that Northern Pulp could possibly be shutting down in the following year asit would leave me without funding. I know that I am not the only student going through thispossibly devastating news because there are many students within the county that areexperiencing the same issue. Not only does my father work at Northern Pulp, but my uncle hasworked in the forestry industry for 35 years. My grandfather has also worked in the forestryindustry but for over 45 years. As a student who was planning to graduate and move backhome to work, I am extremely scared of what is going to become of Nova Scotia, especiallyPictou County. It is from my understanding that if Northern Pulp closes in the upcoming year,it will cause a domino effect in all other forestry jobs within Nova Scotia. Northern Pulpclosing means that there will be no jobs for not only mill workers, but also little to no jobs forthe truck drivers transporting wood/chips and workers initially cutting the wood in saw mills.If this large group of people is no longer having this primary income to spend, then there willbe less money to spend on local businesses. I know for a fact that Northern Pulp employeesspend a great chunk of their paycheck on goods in local businesses. It is very possible thatsome of these local businesses would close as well as a result of Northern Pulp closing. Sincethere are very little good paying jobs in Pictou County, this will force people to m oveelsewhere to find work. From what I have heard, Northern Pulp employees would like to moveout west to find a good enough pay job if Northern Pulp closes. I am one of twelve students inmy first year of at Dalhousie University. It is a demanding program, but I honestly love who I am becoming. It is from my understanding that are in high demand right now as there is a greater population that is aging as I write this. As I sitin the classroom, I start to wonder what my hometown will be like when I graduate. If mycommunity becomes a ghost town, will I want to come home to work? And if I do want tocome home to work, will there still be a job for me here? If people and their families aremoving away to find work, that means there will be a smaller population of people for me as ahealth care professional to treat. Therefore, less will be hired to work. I strongly believe that the project should go forward if the science reveals that there will be noadverse effects due to the discharge line. If the effluent line cannot go where the assessmentwants it to go, there should be an extension granted until a discharge place is found. Thepresent owners of Northern Pulp are committed to the project. I just wish that everyone couldwork together and find a solution that is best for everyone. At this point in time, the best wayfor everyone to work together would be extending the deadline. In conclusion, Northern Pulpclosing its doors would truly be devastating for everyone in Nova Scotia, including myself. Somany families will be forced to move elsewhere in the country to find a good source ofincome. I honestly don\u00e2?Tt know how I will be paying my way through university next year ifdad loses his job. This cares me every time I think about it. Some people may say \u00e2?oOh butyou did/will receive scholarships to pay your way through\u00e2? . The scholarships that Ireceived at my high school graduation did not even pay for half of my cost to go to school this year. Thank you for reading. Name: Email: Environment Assessment Web Account Subject: Northern Pulp Effluent Treatment Proposal Date: March 3, 2019 5:58:58 PM Dear Honorable Minister, I am writing to support the request from fishermen's organizations from Nova Scotia, NewBrunswick, Prince Edward Island and Pictou Landing First Nations to have Northern Pulp'sEffluent Treatment Project designated a project for a Federal Environmental Assessmentunder Section 14 of the Canadian Environment Assessment Act ( CEAA) 2012.I have been a life long resident of Pictou County and have lived in the town of Pictou for thepast 40 years. I taught school for many years and raised a family in the town of Pictou. I havebeen following closely the media coverage of the Northern Pulp situation.I fully support the fishermen of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and thePictou Landing First Nations residents. I am concerned about the impact the proposed effluentpipe will have on fish and fish habitats in the Northumberland Strait. I feel a fullEnvironmental Class 2 Assessment is needed to fully address the concerns of the fishermen,the Pictou Landing First Nations residents and the citizens of Pictou County.My family has had close ties to the Northumberland Strait spending our summers enjoying thewarm waters and beautiful beaches. What will happen if this proposed pipe ruins the watersand in doing so ruins our very lucrative fisheries and tourism industries that rely on theNorthumberland Strait?As a resident of Pictou I am concerned about the proposed pipe extending through ourwatershed area. I have the following questions:What will happen when this pipe leaks?What contingency plan will be put in place for the eventuality of a leak?What effect will a leak have on our health?What monitoring system will be put into place to detect a leak? Past effluent leaks from theNorthern Pulp Mill to Boat Harbour have been detected by local residents. That isunacceptable.My lives within a kilometre of this proposed pipe and she uses a well. How will herwater supply be effected when there is a leak?I ask that you recommend a Federal Environmental Class 2 Assessment be completedregarding this proposed effluent pipe plan.Thank you for your time and consideration of this issue.Yours truly, From: To: Environment Assessment Web Account Subject: Proposed Project Comments Date: March 3, 2019 6:00:46 PM Project: replacement_effluent_treatment_facility_project Comments: As a woodlot owner and employer of over 100 people in NS. I am very concerned that our governments may take ahard line with Northern Pulp to appease many who have no direct or indirect involvement withthis issue at the expense of our tax dollars and the long-term success of our lumber industry inthe province. There is NO CONDITION upon which it is acceptable to force closure in favorof granting additional time for resolution without harm to the industry. I like many are in favorof a balanced environmentally, financially and socially acceptable resolutions if possible in thelong-term.

A great deal of my summer days as a kid werespent enjoying the waters and beaches of the Northumberland Strait and as an adult I spentmany summers sailing those beautiful waters. I've eaten clams, oysters, smelts, mackerel, andlobsters from the Northumberland strait. Now all that and much more is threatened with theproposed effluent pipe from Northern Pulp. I would like to know:1) What chemicals are in the effluent?2) What affect will these chemicals have both in the long and short term on the fish stocks inthe strait?3) Pictou's domestic water is supplied by numerous deep wells through which the proposedeffluent pipe will pass. What steps are being proposed to protect this water supply? 4) What affect will mill effluent in the strait have on tourism?5) Who is going to monitor the affects of a pipe and how will it be monitored?6) With so much at stake and with so much distrust created over the years with this mill, itshould be apparent that nothing less than a federal assessment is needed.

The property borders the Northumberland Strait a few east of MacKenzie Head and approximately meters from the mouth of Boat Harbour as the crow flies. I am years old and I am quite familiar with the impact BoatHarbour has on our shore line prior to and after the effluent treatment facility EFT wasinstalled. I also see the results of improvements made to the EFT over the past 50 years. Eventhough the aesthetics of the shoreline in front of my property may improve, there are moreimportant environmental issues at stake. I welcome the closure of Boat Harbour as an ETFhowever, I have concerns about the rush to approve and implement a new ETF. Theenvironmental assessment EA should not be concerned with the deadline of the Boat HarbourAct, but a thorough review of the data and a reasonable time line for testing should be done. No, I am not agreeing to, nor supporting an extension to the closure of the Boat Harbour EFT.The impact to the mill of a premature closure should be dealt with separately. First, come upwith a best case replacement EFT. EA Class I Inadequate There is far too much data to reviewand too much incomplete information to pass the EA in a 30 day period. Monitoring: The EAdoes not detail the monitoring of the new system. A detail of inspections by people andelectronic devices should be provided. Will monitoring be continuous 24/7, or longer periodsof time? How will the portion of pipe imbedded in the Strait be monitored? Based on the lasttwo pipe breaks, the current methods of detecting and preventative maintenance areinadequate. Current air monitoring is minimal and that tells me Northern Pulp will continueminimal reporting. Total Suspended Solids TSS: During an open house hosted by NorthernPulp, Hugh MacDougal, NP Engineer, explained to me and my wife the new activated sludgetreatment AST process. Part of the process that jumped out was TSS emptying into the straitwould increase. an environmental lawyer, found evidence of increased TSS in an e-mail from a NP technical manager to Dillon Consulting. received the e-mail through an FOI request. Testing: There are several areas in the EA where the writer statesfurther study is recommended. For the sake of brevity, I will mention one. The conclusion inAppendix R, A Summary of Scientific Literature Related to the Effects of BKME onAmerican Lobster recommends further study. The conclusion is on page 51 of Appendix R.When asked about the chemical composition of the effluent at discharge point, no informationwas available. Ice scouring was briefly discussed in the report, but there was no mention ofmock diffusers being installed. I would think a test over several winters would be required tosee the diffusers avoid being damaged by ice scouring. Conclusion: The Province should handover the EA to federal government to do the review. The Province, as a lender and leaseholder of wood lands, is too close to NP creating an apparent conflict of interest. Concerned Citizen New Glasgow, NS Name: Email: Assessment Web Account Subject: Proposed Project Date: March 4, 2019 9:37:54 AM Project: replacement_effluent_treatment_facility_project Comments: I absolutely support the replacement effluent treatment facility project proposed by Northern Pulp. Given the amountof time they had, they have done really well in researching and planning for his project. Theyhave put a lot of effort in gathering scientific evidence that there will be little to no negativeimpact in the Northumberland Strait. They have, in my opinion, jumped through more hoopsand than other industries in Nova Scotia to educate the public. The proposed system is notbran new technology. It has been used by other mills around the world and in Canada and hasproven to be great. My kids and I swim in the Northumberland Strait, we live in Abercrombieso I take the environmental concerns very seriously and I confidently support and believe inNorthern Pulps effluent treatment facility project and absolutely think the project should beapproved asap. Name: Assessment Web Account Subject: Proposed Project Date: March 4, 2019 10:20:10 AM Project: replacement_effluent_treatment_facility_project Comments: Since the 1970s, Environment Canada has established Pulp and Paper Mill Effluent RegulationsPPER thatwould surely be applied to the proposed Northern Pulp pipeline installation. However, thelocal impact of effluent discharges on seafloor communities has probably not been addressedas yet, or has the regional dispersal pattern tidal of effluent discharges in relation to toxiceffects on a range of planktonic and benthic marine species? I would presume that these issueswould be addressed in a federal environmental impact Assessment Web Account Subject: Proposed Project Date: March 4, 2019 10:41:58 AM Project: replacement_effluent_treatment_facility_project Comments: Am I bias? I try not to be. I work at the mill and I feel like my livelihood will be jeopardized if Northern Pulp closes.I have always tried to look at each side of the story when it comes to environmental issues. Aswe know it. The Maritimes have made their wealth off industry\u00e2?\u00a6. And it seems each timewhen industry leaves the public and government think that tourism will boom but I have yet tosee that happen in places that are ghost towns now. I feel we need to look at the overallproblem. The public has seen what has happened to the mill in the past and they bring thosepast experiences with them and they aren\u00e2?Tt positive. In order to move forward we need toput the past behind us and live for the future. What future is here in Nova Scotia? Nova Scotiahas an abundance of renewable resources. Tress being one of them. We have a seedlingdepartment in Debert that we have seasonal workers plant trees in the summer. I know it doestake time for the trees to get to be at the state that we harvest them \u00e2?\" but it\u00e2?Ts not like wedon\u00e2?Tt think about replanting. I know if the Mill closes I will more than likely venture outwest to find better work. That includes my partner as well. Everything will be affect in my life.If the industry isn\u00e2?Tt here it will just go elsewhere and it will be a loss to the Maritimes.Keep people working in Assessment Web Account Subject: Northern Pulp Date: March 4, 2019 11:23:53 AM As a woodlot owner I support Northern Pulp.

I am writing in relation to Norther Pulp's Replacement Effluent Treatment Facility Project. I am for a full blown national external environmental assessment that will not be a conflict of interest. I am very informed about the mill...have read everything I think there is to read and spend the first hour of every day reading the websites on it. I am very sad to see the issue of a pipe tear the community of PictouCounty apart. I am very sensitive to the arguments on both sides. \u00b7Hundred (into the thousands) of people making their living in the forestry, trucking, etc. \u00b7The cost of healthcare due to high cancer rates in Pictou county, the billion dollar cost to tax payers to clean up the chemical mess at boat harbour, the affect on tourism and thefishing industry, the cost of all the donations the governmentgives to the mill to keep those 250 jobs (and spin offs), the freshwater cost, the clear cutting, the chemical spraying, thecorruptness, deception and lies from all governments. I am strongly against Northern Pulp, putting a pipe into the strait and continually not meeting industry environmental standards and regulations. I believe this foreign company can afford to meet industry standards but enjoys getting away with abusingthe citizens and government because they can... fear and threats have worked well for them for years. I am not against the mill but am against the abuse the native Canadians, the environment and citizens of PictouCounty. I don't think the owners of Northern pulp care about the environment or the health of PictouCounty residents. Yet they are making the profits that they could invest in these things. I grew up a cottage on the Northumberland strait cottage and watched the water continually grow browner and smellier each year. We can't continue to accept the assault on the environment at any cost. Iunderstand jobs are important!! But if a study were conducted and the cost of the donated land, water,causeway, health costs, clean up, loans, donations made compared to the cost of jobs.... I wonder whichwould come out on top... minus the assault on the water, forest, air and water pollution. It is very complex. More people would invest and start businesses, more doctors, retired people, professionals, artists and trades people would come, stay longer or move back, and Tourism and property sales and prices wouldincrease, if people were not afraid to breathe, eat the fish, and swim in Pictou County. I still live in Pictou county 2 months a year - but I pay property taxes and expenses ( 12 months a year), insurance, hydro, boat storage, and grass cutting/snow plowing, twelve months a year. I have purchaseproperty, hired an architect, contractor, plumbers, electricians, bought boats, cars, a, put on a new roof month, replaced a deck, heating system, bought gym memberships, paid boat mechanics and boat storage, groceries, gas, have an account at home depot. The vision for the future has be in line with a knowledge based economy. The economy in Pictou County appears pretty bleak. The front street of Pictou and New Glasgow, the malls, and restaurants appear empty,houses are for sale everywhere, the population is not growing, - it doesn't seem like the mill is saving thecommunity. The status quo has not and is not working. The citizens of Pictou County deserve better.Nothing is worth breathing chemicals, swimming in brown water and gooey foam when the breeze isonshore, water with mercury and other chemical and eating fish from this water. I want to raise awareness and be part of the solution to bring the place I still call 'home' back to life. I recently wrote a letter to the environment minister voicing concerns over the rush to get the assessment conducted on NP proposal to pour the effluent directly into the strait. It took his office more than 30 daysto send me a form letter, which didn't even answer my questions. If they can't answer emails in 30 dayshow can we expect them to do an environment review in 30 day! My question is, why the rush? It appears biased. If we all want the best for our town lets take our time anddo the right thing long term. I know this can't be easy. But please do not cave to NP threats. Their concern isprofits for their foreign company not the health and welfare of New Glasgow citizens or the environment inPictou county. What is the worst thing that could happen if they take an additional 30-60 days to access the proposal? The facts will emerge and the plant could close? Perhaps then NP would invest in their companyand finally meet industry expectations. Do we not have the vision and foresight to deal with this scenario? Ican think of several alternatives as I am certain you can too. Please recommend an extended review so decision are based on knowledge and not emotion. Take thetime required for such a serious decision. Develop mechanisms to keep the young people in New Glasgow,strategies to grow the population (which hasn't grown since NP arrived), and stop New Glasgow from receiving consistent negative press as one of the worst Canadian communities to live. Please make adecision based on information and facts and to keep more people from leaving and more of us comingback. I look forward to seeing you soon in New Glasgow. email: @um.edu.mt University of Ottawa uottawa.ca From: @ns.sympatico.ca To: Environment Assessment Web Account Subject: Proposed Date: March 4, 2019 11:57:34 AM Project: replacement_effluent_treatment_facility_project Comments: Feel that Northern Pulp should be granted an extension on Boat Harbour in order to have their effluent line installed.The loss of jobs this mill provides directly and indirectly would certainly be felt across a goodpart of the province. Pictou Co.can not afford to lose the large financial contribution the millputs in to the local economy. However it is important that the pipe is installed meeting orexceeding the environmental standards that are imposed on them. I believe there is a solutionthat everyone can benefit from if done correctly. Name: Email: Address Privacy-Statement: agree x: Environment Assessment Web Account Subject: Northern Pulp EA Response Letter Date: March 4, 2019 12:16:00 PM Department of Environment, I am writing in regards to Northern Pulp's new effluent treatment facility and 15.5 km pipe proposed to discharge up to 85 million litres of treated effluent and four tonnes ofsuspended solids every day into the Northumberland Strait. I would like to address losingthe Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) blue seal, the fact that the quality of the treatedeffluent will actually be worse and Appendix R Bleached Kraft Mill Effluent (BKME) effectson lobster. I am a third generation fishermen, my grandfather and father both fished the Northumberland Strait. Fishing has changed a lot since my grandfather started, weregulate the size of our lobsters, put in escapes, use dissolving string, reduced theamount of traps we fish just to name a few of the sustainable fishing practices we use.Lobster from the Bay of Fundy, Scotian Shelf and Southern Gulf of St. Lawrence have theprestigious Marine Stewardship Council blue seal since May 2015. This is an internationalstamp of environmental sustainability. It opens up international markets that requirethird party certification. This is hard to achieve and easily lost. MSC are watching thisNorthern Pulp proposal very closely to see the outcome. If that certification is lost it willgreatly affect the sale of lobsters from all three provinces which ship to the US, Europeand Asia. More than 3000 people make a living on the Northumberland Strait, 18,000people are working in the fishing industry in Nova Scotia. Seafood exports is a $2 billionindustry for Nova Scotia, if the blue seal of MSC is lost that number will go downsignificantly, this is a serious threat to the Canadian fishing industry(Dept Fisheries,Gov't of NS, NS Exports). The Nova Scotia provincial government and Northern Pulp have both been spreading the misinformation that their treated effluent has been going out into the Strait for 50 yearstherefore there is nothing to worry about. This is not true, I have witnessed it firsthand.My first year rock crab fishing I put my crab cones along the mouth of Pictou Harbour. AsI fished up from Lighthouse Beach the smell became unbearable and the cone came upfilled with black silt and no crab, I moved the cone away from the area and found out thatwas close to the Boat Harbour outfall. What I have come to learn in the past year is theway Boat Harbour treatment facility works is the treatment is completed at point C, butjust because this is the end of the Boat Harbour Effluent Treatment Facility (BHETF) doesnot mean that is has finished treatment. It there releases into the lagoon where thewater sits for 20-30 days, cooling and settling solids, then through a dam as the waterlevels get high and with the tide release into the Strait at Point D (Boat Harbour Mapattached). It then flows back and forth within a box tide along the shore betweenMacKenzie Point and the end of Lighthouse Beach (Tidal Flushing of Pictou Harbour andPictou Road, Fisheries Research Board of Canada Technical report no. 146, 1969). This ismuch different from the new proposed system where it will be treated for hours insteadof 20-30 days, the temperature will be 25oC in the winter and 37oC in the summer (NPproposal Table 5.2-1) and relentlessly pumping out onto fishing grounds. The treatedeffluent quality at point C is the same quality it will be when pumped into the Strait. Bothmeet regulations, these regulations are not stringent enough to prevent harm, the mill ismeeting regulations but their Environmental Effects Monitoring (EEM) shows NorthernPulp is doing harm to fish habitat and the only thing being done about it is every threeyears Environment Canada gives them recommendations (PEI Legislative Assembly Feb1st 2019). Through a FOIPOP it was found that Northern Pulp's technical manager agrees that the effluent will actually be worse coming out of the new pipe that what iscoming out of Boat Harbour now. (Email dated Nov 2017 Technical Manager Northern Pulp, FOIPOP) What is in the treated effluent that will be pumped onto our fishing grounds? It is not in the environmental assessment which states that the chemistry characteristics will not be known until the project is operational. This is a hugegap in the proposal, we do know that it contains dioxins, furans and heavy metals.Shellfish, such as scallops which I also commercially fish, absorb dioxin and furans at25,000-50,000 times the concentration in the water. Cumulative effects would causedeformities, and embryo larval mortalities in fish, chronic effects include significantirreversible factors which jeopardize the continuance of the species and the integrity ofthe ecosystem (Environment Canada, 1991). Further to accumulative effects on marine life the FOIPOP done by had a letter from the Dept of Environment stating that Northern Pulp should have a study on accumulative effects of BKME on marine life,this was not completed, another gap in the EA. After reading Appendix R of the EA I fail to see how this can even be called a study, ifStantec can run the study saying everything will meet background by 2 to 5 meters andStantec is also in charge of running the lobster study which says because it meetsbackground by 5 meters lobsters will not be affected. There needs to be independentthird party studies done on both the plume and the effect on lobsters. Harvesters havehistory with Stantec (Confederation Bridge) and they have a history of not agreeing withtheir reports. The receiving water study is just a prediction, it is not factual therefore theresults of Appendix R are not fact they are just a prediction based on a prediction, notvery comforting to a $2 billion a year industry. The devastating effect this could have on the commercial fishing industry cannot beoverstated. The construction alone of the pipe has the potential to greatly harm thefishing industry, the frequency of daily pumping 85 million litres of hot treated effluentand four tonnes of suspended solids would cause uninhabitable conditions for marine life.As for reversibility, we need to look no further than Boat Harbour Remediation Project.This will take millions of taxpayer dollars and years to restore and that is a containedarea. There will not be a remediation project large enough for the Strait, it will neverrecover if this proposal is approved. Therefore I ask that you reject this proposal, if youcan not reject I ask that an Environment Assessment Report be completed, there is toomuch at risk. Thank you Minister, "}
