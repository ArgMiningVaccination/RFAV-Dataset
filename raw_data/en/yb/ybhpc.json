Review Article Received: October 04, 2019; Published: November 04, 2019 There is a palm reading and life holoscope in Japan, which is related to the ancient China. It can be said that it is a part of Orien- tal medicine, not only the face, It can be said that it is \"experiential wisdom\" which teaches the way of life by seeing all the appearance of man mainly on the face. By acquiring the knowledge of the \"as- pects\", in order to live in the present age, know yourself, know peo- ple, prepare in advance for various problems that can happen in the future, and think about the past, present, future, and important fortunes related to yourself, family, friends, etc. could be of help. Abstract Keywords: Diet; Beauty; Medicine Feature studiesCosmetic therapy is a kind of treatment that enhances the sense of health by makeup, and actually tries to solve psychological problems by it, whereas conventional dermatologists tend to target local treatments, It can be said that it is study of a new area of making to examine the person's whole body physically and mentally in the integrated medical treatment, and using the make-up as a treatment means. The mind and the health condition appear also in the expression of the face though eyes which are often said to be the window of the mind. It has developed as a aspect from ancient times. Kansogaku (Feature holoscope) came to Japan from China, but in the Edo period, Nanboku Mizuno developed his own field by incorporating the influence of meals based on his experiences. The idea of Yin and Yang was taken by Yukikazu Sakurazawa, and it advocated the positive effect of food in macrobiotics, and suc- cessor Michio Kushi developed it further internationally. In this paper, these historical backgrounds are briefly described to make it easy to understand. The brown rice diet recommended by macrobiotics nurtures a unique intestinal flora, helps to maintain bowel movements, intes - tinal environment, and intestinal immunity, and these also reflected in skin health. In addition, fasting enhances -hydroxybutyric acid and other ketone bodies, and exhibits various health effects, including mood uplifting. I want to introduce the influence on the skin by fasting, and introduce the relation with the intestinal bacteria etc. Nanboku Mizuno was born in 1760 and was a master of Kansoh (feature) studies in the middle of the Edo period [1]. At that time, it was the best spectator family in Japan, and \"Theory of food opening luck\" was recited. Nanboku Mizuno was born in Awaza, Osaka, but lost his parents in infancy and was taken over by his uncle, who was a blacksmith, but his character was so twisted that he lived his days of drinking and fighting in Tenma, Osaka, when he was 10 years old. And, it Views of nanboku mizunoDOI: 10.31080/ASNH.2019.03.0522 Citation: Sawako Hibino and Medicine and Diet for Beauty\". Acta Scientific Nutritional Health 3.12 (2019): 17-26.Cosmetic Therapy Medicine and Diet for Beauty 18 was made to work the wrong thing by the sake fee greed, and to be imprisoned when it was 18 years old. Nanboku was a villain with a heinous face (Figure 1). Figure 1 The mouth is thin, and affection is lacked, eyes are steep, trian- gular white eyes which are a lot of criminals, and the hollow eyes show the pull and the ill idea. Nanboku had the hint of the short- lived life with a narrow, unstable state of mind, the thin eyebrow suggested no brother luck. The nose is low, poor and short-lived. The teeth were small and poor, suggesting short-lived, and the feet were also small, so it was a small man, and it was a phase which lacked affection. It is said that the death phase has appeared to the face from the human view, and it is said, \"It will be a apprentice if the meal only of wheat and the soybean is continued for half a year\" when it wishes to leave the temple Suiryuji in Jiunyama for the fate con- version. When he continued to eat only wheat and soybeans as he was told while working riverbank in Dojima River, not only did the death phase disappear from his face, but his fortune improved. From these experiences, he became interested in the field of perspective of life, and he advocated that the mastery of the field would be improved by conducting the study of the three years of the apprenticeship of the hair-tied floor, the three years of yuya's (public spar) three-year work, and the three years of the cremato- rium's cover-up and the three years of the cremation house. Even if the person of the small meal is an ominous aspect in the human aspect, the fortune is good, the life which is blessed as such is, and does not die young. Especially, later years are good luck. The person who always exceeds an appropriate amount of food is likely to get sick even if it is a good feature in the human aspect. It is easy to cause the trouble to the peripheral nerve as the hand is tangled, it is annoyed by the stress through life, and the fortune in later years is evil. There is a constant rhythm and moderation also in man's life. It is easy to get on the eating, diabetes, pancreatitis, heart disease, liver disease, nephritis, cerebrovascular disorders, etc. by disregarding it. Therefore, the one to disregard moderation will actually be short-lived even if the phase of longevity is invited, and suffer by the sequelae of the pain. The person of the rough food gets good luck even if it is poor. The good luck of the fortune of the person whose meal is always an appropriate amount is accord- ing to the judgment of the human aspect study. Modern lifestyle- related diseases had already been overlooked in the Edo period, 300 years ago. As a result of abstaining from eating for a lifetime, Nanboku lived to be 74 years old in 1834. In his later years, he made a for - tune spanning one square and seven warehouses. Nanboku Mizuno, who were born to the fate of the most impov - erished and short-lived, who were actually out of human path and dying, single-mindedly searched for man, became a long-lived and happy millionaire, and left for the happiness of all the people of the later world, helpful for everyone [2]. Michio Kushi was a disciple of Yoshikazu Sakurazawa, who led to the Ishizuka Sagen, who created the curing association, and went to the United States to advocate peace after World War II [3]. He no longer appreciated the value of studying politics and law at univer - sity, decided to observe people to know what human beings are, day after day. He spent time watching the people who went on the streets of Fifth Avenue and Times Square in New York City, which is crowded with many people. The meaning of human life with the empty inside of the head, happiness and unhappiness, the differ - ence between rich and poor, the difference of race, the difference of the color of the skin, he kept thinking about endless questions about things like that. One day, two and a half months later, he recognized that hu- man beings were made by the environment in which they were Michio Kushi's views (Macrobiotics) Citation: Sawako Hibino and Shaw Therapy Medicine and Diet for Beauty\". Acta Scientific Nutritional Health 3.12 (2019): 17-26.19Cosmetic Therapy Medicine and Diet for Beauty located. Not only do we live alone, but we are not only living in a home or social environment, but also in the warm sun, air, wa- ter that springs from the underground. There is also the influence of the natural environment such as a pleasant wind which blows through the forest. People can't go against the environment, but there's only one environment where you can choose for yourself, and that's what food is all about. The difference between each food and the difference in people appears. In order to prove this innovative idea, he learned and studied fast and researched people, the environment, people and food. Steak, barbecue, burgers, sugar, bread, American food, French with lots of milk and cheese, Italian food with a lot of pasta, olives and salads, oily Chinese food, Indian food with a lot of curry, etc. were thoroughly studied. The conclusion was that it is important to cook and eat grains, and eat vegetables, legumes, and seaweed as side foods, with brown rice and raw grains, in the \"rediscovery\" of traditional Japa- nese food culture. This was the ideal meal for macrobiotics. Kushi developed a shop called Erewhon (the opposite of no where) to spread the pop- ularization of natural food with hippies at the time, and his work was exhibited in the Smithsonian Museum now. The desire to be beautiful is a common desire for women. But first, if you're not healthy, you can't be beautiful. The beauty of a person who doesn't have a solid foundation for health quickly falls off. In order to maintain a clean skin, the whole body must be healthy. Recently, there is a beauty boom, and there are a lot of models and talents who can boast beautiful skin appear on TV and magazines. On the other hand, the number of women who are hav - ing trouble with symptoms such as bulky skin and becoming oily is increasing. Skin problems are closely related to diet. Hot skin, cold skin, greasy skin, rough skin, hard skin, freckles, moles, etc. can be corrected by meals. What is the relationship between skin problems and eating habits?Compared to the Sakurazawa's Diet Association, Kushi macro- biotics is internationalized and its ingredients are diversified [4,5]. All good for the skin, but as a recipe the following points are simple and effective. Eat vegetables in whole skin Take mushrooms and seaweed If you eat skin, choose organic vegetables Boiling heat from high heat to low heat. There is a knack when cooking. When boiling, the heat is weak - ened when boiling and it makes it to \"Slow fire\" though it may be a high heat until it boils. It is better not to boil the food loosely, and it is assumed that it is about 80\u00b0C. The use of this fire is based on Yin and Yang. Beautiful, shiny skin has to do with calmness. Standard diet of Kushi macrobiotics For instance, it is a story in Boston State Mental Hospital. Sugar and meat were removed from the meal menu of the hospital be- cause it was consulted whether the Kushi macrobiotic diet method was able to be used for the treatment of patients who had ailing the spirit. As an alternative to meat, he used a hamburger-style menu with crushed beans. At first, many patients reacted to the change in the content of the meal, but the dedication of the volunteer stu- dents gradually helped the patients regain their composure. Began to eat a new meal about a month later, a significant change in the patient's symptoms became more and more peaceful. On the other hand, if you continue to eat the wrong diet, your mind will be distorted. What and how to eat is a big problem relat - ed to a person's life. It is also the responsibility of adults who have continued to give only fast food, such as convenience store lunches and hamburgers, to young people who cause problems. In order to maintain calm feelings and peace of mind, the first step is to im- prove the eating habits by macrobiotic. Then, the mind and the face become calm. The first step in keeping people's minds healthy is to improve their food problems.There are many examples of diet related to mood It's lazy every day, they are easy to get tired, I don't have con- centration, it becomes \"Depression\". Not a few people have such a problem. If you feel sick, remember what you ate the day before. Sweet treats, greasy meals, late-night snacks. The cause of the slump is the food you eat yourself.The cause of the malfunction is in the food Citation: Sawako Hibino and Shaw Watanabe . \"Cosmetic Therapy Medicine and Diet for Beauty\". Acta Scientific Nutritional Health 3.12 (2019): 17-26.20Cosmetic Therapy Medicine and Diet for Beauty Many people suffer from allergies and atopic, have tried various medicines and treatments, but have not worked and have arrived at macrobiotics as a last resort. Atopic dermatitis, which causes skin problems, is said to have a genetic constitution, mites, mold, etc., but it is said that lunch box - es, side dishes, and cup noodles sold at convenience stores. Instant foods such as snacks and continue to eat milk, sugar, animal fat, because it contains a lot of artificial additives, it is easy to be atopic. The human body is made up of natural things, and is made to accept the things of nature willingly. Ingredients such as dairy products, sugar, animal fats, and food additives in food are consid - ered to be extra and will not be accepted. Bad things that could not be processed are accumulated inside the body, or discharged to the table through the skin. Inflammation and various symptoms become atopic at that time. By incorporating macrobiotics, you can create a healthy body that is difficult to get sick without taking medicine or taking a de - tour to see a doctor [6,7]. I want to explain why the macrobiotics which makes brown rice a staple food is good for health with sci - entific evidence later. When you eat brown rice, the side food is also affected, and there are many kinds of ingredients. We did a GENKI study (Gen- mai Evidence for Nutrition and Kenko Innovation) to give evidence about the effects of brown rice diet, but the brown rice eaters took traditional Japanese vegetables, such as red beans, soy milk, sesa - me, pickles, nuts, shiitake, dried radish, and not took lettuce, avo- cado, banana, melon, and other Western-style vegetables. There is a large intake of Japanese-style food stuffs such as kelp [8-11] . On the contrary of soy, there are a lot of intake of soy products, sea- foods, meat, dairy products, sugar is not significantly consumed. On the other hand, what we eat in the white rice diet is leafy vegetables like spinach, tomatoes, lots of vegetables such as green peppers, and meats and dairy products. Measure various nutrients, minerals, vitamins, antioxidants, etc. for brown rice, germ rice, and white rice revealed that the di - etary fiber and minerals are the highest in brown rice, antioxidant value(AOU) is high in brown rice, and it remained about half after cooking rice. Most people who dislike brown rice have never eaten good brown rice, and they don't like it. There are a lot of reasons who dislikes brown rice is hard to chew, and it leans on the stomach. However, the electric kettle and the pressure cooker for brown rice came to be able to cook delicious brown rice easily [12]. You can taste the deep umami (goof taste) that cannot be tasted with white rice by mixing red beans, awa (millet), corn and edamame (green soy bean) as appropriate. Increase in free fatty acids, vita- mins B6, and GABA, such as germ rice only by applying brown rice overnight in water, it is also possible to cook to increase the func- tional components more by cooking method. Recently, there is also a new rice processing method that peels off only the hard wax layer on the outside called wax free brown rice, rice that can be treated like white rice while saving the same nutrients as brown rice appeared and it has become popular [13]. Mitsuo Koda's diet is based on the symptoms of each person, how to eat less, and how to eat and excrete completely without a laxative [14]. In the process of repeated decay fermentation of stagnant stool in the intestinal tract, because it produces toxins that cause cancer and various diseases, \"the stool is thought to be the source of all diseases\". Now, by improving the measurement method, such as metabolome, toxins that are in the blood from the intestinal tract has been proven directly [15].Koda diet Koda-style fasting therapy has a total energy of around 900kcal per day, and protein is 25 to 27g a day. Initially, weight will be lost, and some people may have general malaise, wobble, headaches, etc. Typical expample is Mori M, who live on one glass on vegetables for more than 18 years [16]. The diet is vegan vegetarian, and people with a lot of weight loss may reach 10 to 15 kg in obese people, but is usually 5 to 8 kg. They lost weight for the first five months, then leveled up, and after a Fasting is the best way to improve the intestinal environment Citation: Sawako Hibino and Shaw Watanabe . \"Cosmetic Therapy Medicine and Diet for Beauty\". Acta Scientific Nutritional Health 3.12 (2019): 17-26.21Cosmetic Therapy Medicine and Diet for Beauty few more months, they gained weight and became constant in the future. 14 When you gain weight, your body is getting better, your stamina is coming out, and you can have a comfortable day both mentally and physically. The good bacteria are increased by correcting the intestinal en- vironment which will be described later [17]. The rise of ketone bodies by fasting will also be described later [18-20] . The skin of the old Sumo wrestler was smooth white like a feath- er silk woven cloth. Today's sumo wrestlers have a lot of breakouts and injuries, and the number of sumo wrestlers with beautiful skin is decreasing. White girls are beautiful, but when they grow up, they don't have the resilience. Black skin is thick and rough. Gener - ally Japanese have clean skin and touch feeling is good. The differ - ence in diet and natural environment over the years is reflected in the condition of the skin. The skin is greatly related to the metabolism of lipids [21]. Skin surface layer is spread sebum secreted from the pores, the seba- ceous membrane covering the surface of the skin, which serves to prevent evaporation of moisture from the skin. The ceramide has a role of filling the gap between epithelial cells as intercellular lipids, also to prevent excessive evaporation of moisture. In addition, the subcutaneous collagen fibers and elastic fibers cause tension and elasticity of the skin. Fatty acids constituting fats and oils can be roughly grouped into three groups based on metabolism in the body. Poly saturated fatty acids high in tallow and pig fat, 3 oleic acid, which is made from excess carbohydrates and proteins in the body and is the main component of animal fats like linoleic acid. 6 oil is related to growth and reproduction which becomes arachidonic acid and eicosanoid in the body made from plant oils. Alpha linolenic acid is also produced by plants, but when in- gested by animals, it is converted into eicosapentaenolic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). These three groups are not converted to each other in vivo. Since the 6/3 ratio of fatty acids by food is largely this, the choice of food is biased 6/3 of the brain lipid changes, it was revealed to affect the behavior of animals. Canola oil, soybean oil, red flower oil, etc. are often rich Food and skin beauty6, the Japanese has an 6/3 ratio of about 4-5, while the 6/3 ratio of sesame oil is about 2.3 ideally. The intake of fat is also included fat-soluble vitamins and func- tional ingredients. Dry skin to prevent blemishes, etc. vitamin A, beta carotene, vitamin E promote the production of collagen, which is the source of firmness and elasticity of the skin, works with vita- min C and protein, and dries the skin when it is insufficient, such as vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) that keratinization occurs. The skin and fat metabolism are closely related, but the poly - morphism of genes is also involved. The EPA and DHA of 3 are common in fish oil such as mackerel, and salmon. EPA and DHA produce resorbins and protectors, which are active metabolites derived from omega-3 fatty acids that reduce allergies. Japanese fish intake was originally about 90g, but it is de - creasing every year in Japanese, and it became 66g in 2017 [21]. If you don't take fish, you can't make an EPA in your body and you can't keep your health, because about 15% Japanese people does not have 5 - desaturase as a homo which work on elongation of fatty acids. Conversely, the intake of 6 fatty acids that promote inflam- mation such as arachidonic acid, prostaglandins, leukotriene has increased. Whites have no lack of alpha -DHA, because they origi - nally have linolenic acid desaturase allows self-generation of EPA to DHA. However, it was found that Zen monks who didn't eat fish were not lacking in EPA or DHA, and that they were taking a lot of sea- weed to replace it. In addition, the amount of Nori's fatty acids was small, but they were all EPA. Fish accumulate DHA by ingesting sea- weed and small fish. Vegetarians who don't eat fish meat seem to have a reduced intake of arachidonic acid by not eating meat, and are generally balanced by eating seaweeds. Linoleic acid (6) and - linolenic acid (3) the balance ratio is currently 4-5, but Okuyama et al . [21] assumed that it is preferable to reduce the ratio to make it to about three. Fatty acid metabolism of the skin Citation: Sawako Hibino and Shaw Watanabe . \"Cosmetic Therapy Medicine and Diet for Beauty\". Acta Scientific Nutritional Health 3.12 (2019): 17-26.22Cosmetic Therapy Medicine and Diet for Beauty The mechanism of the onset of adult acne is the same as that of adolescent acne, but in many women exacerbated by stress, lack of sleep, irregular living, inappropriate skin care, etc. In addition, since there are many people with dry skin compared to puberty, moisturizers may be needed to reduce the side effects of treat- ment. If amenorrhea continues or the hair becomes darker, there may be hormonal abnormalities caused by polycystic ovarian syn- drome. Guidelines for the Treatment of Acne by the American Society of Dermatology recommend medications that are effective in clog- ging pores called adapalene and make it difficult to develop acne, and antibiotics and coatings that are effective for acne and inflam- mation [22]. In the other treatments include chemical peeling and Chinese medicine. It is likely to become rather awful when the amateur does for oneself though there is a treatment of the surface pressing which pushes out the hole by opening the hole of the se - bum which is accumulated in the pores with the needle. We need a regular life with less stress, and meals are balanced to avoid snacking and avoid excess fat and sweetness. Puberty can also be a growing period. You need to eat a balanced diet without limiting your meals blindly. The secretion of sebum, an important factor in acne, is con- trolled by hormones. Human hormones have secretion batane changes in the morning and night, such as lack of sleep and life reversed day and night, it becomes a aggravating factor of acne be- cause the balance of hormones is collapsed. Adult acne Japan Society of Integrated Medicine and The Japan CI Asso - ciation, Seishoku Association, KEIO Group Arsoa, people in Kushi Macrobiotics, are running brown rice vegetarian diets, which are popular with young women. By changing the diet to brown rice diet, we are living energetically, aiming to suppress various dis - eases and to live an uncured life [23,24] . The brown rice diet is very good as an old-fashioned Japanese food. I'm doing a study called GENKI Study, and 1200 people par- ticipated who have been feeding for a long time. The health factors of the brown rice eater were able to be clarified by having partici- pated in the this study [8,9]. The beauty and the sense of health of the brown rice eaterPeople with brown rice diet had a high sense of health. Especial- ly, there were a lot of people who answered questionnaires that the elderly person was healthy or generally healthy [25]. The middle- aged generation will lose their sense of health because of the stress. People with a high subjective sense of health often responded to walking seven to eight thousand steps a day, waking up in the morning, not getting up in the toilet in the middle of the night, and meditating. These people were careful about life in general, such as breathing techniques and taking a forest bath. They had a variety of fasting experience, such as one day fasting, three-day fasting, and one-week fasting. A healthy feeling are based on the physical ability to practice various activities, but also related to the symbiosis with intestinal bacteria. The deep relationship between intestinal bacteria and the brain is proposed as microbiome-gut-brain axis. This has become a new research area [25,26] . There are many mechanisms by which the intestinal flora can send signals to the brain, activation of vagal nerves, of microbial an- tigens that mobilize immune B cell responses, production of short chain fatty acids of metabolites, and include intestinal secretion signaling from intestinal epithelial cells, such as catecholamine, GABA, tryptophan, etc. enter the portal vein, carried to the brain in the bloodstream become a neurotransmitter, which is thought to enhance a sense of well-being and subjective health [26]. Tryp- tophan, which is the material for serotonin, is included in many foods; beef red 200mg, walnuts 200mg, brown rice 100mg, barley pressed 90mg, white rice 84mg, banana 10 mg, etc., and there is no shortage in a balanced diet. Tyrosine is also included in these ingredients of foods. Brown rice diet and a sense of health Intestinal epithelium has cells with neuroendocrine gran- ules, glp-1(glucagon-like (peptide YY), releases peptide hormones such as CCK(cholecystquinin). These hormones are carried by a pathway called the gastrointestinal tract and the intestinal brain axis of the brain, where appetite regulation by gastrointestinal hormones works at the appetite center of the brain. Under the intestinal mu- cosa, there are B lymphocytes, dendritic cells, macrophages and Intestinal bacteria - intestinal tract - brain connection Citation: Sawako Hibino and Shaw Watanabe . \"Cosmetic Therapy Medicine and Diet for Beauty\". Acta Scientific Nutritional Health 3.12 (2019): 17-26.23Cosmetic Therapy Medicine and Diet for Beauty other immune cells capable of producing antibodies, TNF-, IL-1, IL-6 to produce cytokines. These stimuli send information to the brain through the vagus nerve. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) pro- duced by intestinal bacteria are also absorbed and metabolized, but some are carried to the brain [27]. These various substances and information are related to behavior, neuroregeneration, neu- rotransmission, inflammation in the brain. The composition of intestinal bacteria was also different by fasting, people with a lot of Enterobacter hydrobutyric acid was likely to be high [28]. The number of bacteria genus decreases dur - ing fasting, but diversity increases after fasting. Dietary fiber classified as prebiotics is fermented and decom - posed by the function of intestinal bacteria. Also, 90% of Japa- nese people have common microbes Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes gate, in which 57 species are such fermented bacteria. Unpolished brown rice contains more dietary fiber than white rice (3.0g of brown rice per 100g of rice vs. white rice 0.5g), further, brown rice contains vitamin B1, B2, folic acid, vitamin E, magnesium, in addi - tion to other ingredients such as zinc, GABA, - orizanol and ferulic acid [29]. The main dietary fiber of brown rice is cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin, which are cell wall components of plants [30]. Hemicel - lulose contains carbohydrates other than glucose, a polysaccharide associated with cellulose in the plant cell wall. These include both linear and branched molecules smaller than cellulose, generally 50 to 200 pentose units (xylose and arabinose) and hexose units consisting of ramnose and glucuronic acid and galactulonic acid, in a group with uneven structures pres - ent in the plant world in the form of water-soluble and insoluble, vegetables, fruits, beans and nuts. Hemicellulose of rice bran is present mainly arabinokisilane. Dietary fiber Fasting has been widely used by religious people since ancient times. It is Koda's therapy described previously that adopted to the medical therapy and it took positively in the integrated medicine [31]. The KEIO Group, which teamed up with Kushi to promote mac- robiotics, has pursued beauty by adopting fasting [20]. Figure Fastingskater Mao Asada's sparkling beauty has come in charge of the diet with the support of the Arsoa's dietitian. It is a fast of three nights and four days, but the petit fast of a day is planned recently. The program in the fast is decided in detail, and fasts while undergo- ing guidance of an individual correspondence. They take about 360 kilocalories of enzyme fermented vegetable juice a day, and takes lecture courses, gymnastics, and walks in between. Already, ayurvedic yoga and meditation have been adopted as complementary alternative medicine in Europe and the United States, and an attempt has been made to improve the sense of health by maintaining the balance of sympathetic and parasympa- thetic nerves well [32]. Andrew Weil [33], who advocates the fusion of Western medicine and Oriental medicine integrated American Integrated Medicine, Traditional Medicine and Medicinal Botany. Although it is a field that is not yet widely accepted in Japan, it has spread all over the world as a pioneer in holistic medicine and nar- rative medicine. Andrew Weil, with moderate exercise and stress control proposed that it is important to maintain a healthy state for a lifetime. The diversity of values is directly linked to the way of life of in- dividuals, and it is attracting attention as an environmental factor surrounding the individual's body and spirit. In health policy, the addition of the words Spiritual and dynamic to who's health defi - nition was also considered [32,34,35]. Spiritual health is an indi - vidual ADL (Activities of Daily Living). High, of course, is evaluated by the healthy and best state in which a person can be oneself, i.e., a \"subjective sense of health\" that reflects the way of feeling and the psychological elements of an individual. After the fatting of the skin transparency and inflammation, the third day of return meal, the change in the first month of the return meal, the effect of fasting appears, but the difference with the presence or absence of brown rice is not so obvious. Rather, or nutritional balance of the main and side dishes, continued drinking after fasting of healthy foods containing vitamin B group and anti - oxidants are also affected [17-20] . The transparency of the skin increases even after the phasing, and the influence was able to be seen even in the first month of the return meal.Effects of fasting on the skin Citation: Sawako Hibino and Shaw Watanabe . \"Cosmetic Therapy Medicine and Diet for Beauty\". Acta Scientific Nutritional Health 3.12 (2019): 17-26.24Cosmetic Therapy Medicine and Diet for Beauty Moreover, fasting is a good effect to the inflammation of the skin, and continues even the first month of the return meal. Recently, a low-carb diet has been recommended for diabetics. Tetsuo Muneta, an obstetrician and gynecologist, leads pregnant diabetics to safe delivery through ketone diets [36]. It is the most efficient not to take sugar as a ketone diet, MEC (meat, egg, cheese, 110g each) diet is recommended. Chronological change of ketone in relation to glucose is not well observed. A patient, 36 years of age, had the first baby suf- fered from gestational diabetes, and the second pregnancy was also heavy gestational diabetes. She gave birth safely by lowering her blood glucose level by eating ketone meal at Muneta Clinic. She collaborated to measure three-day change in glucose and beta hy - droxybutyric acid, because she continued to eat ketone after delivery.Low carb diets and ketones Figure 2: Ketogenic diet of 32 y/o women 3 years after delivery. She continued MEC diet since her gestational diabetes. Breakfast is mid chain fatty acid oil and coffee, lunch is nuts and salad, And dinner is salad and fish or baked meat. Blood beta hydroxybutyrate shows chronological cycle but glucose is stable around 5 mmole. It is interesting that glucose is kept around 5mM even in a state where it takes little carbohydrate. The diet is such as coconut oil and medium-chain fatty acid oil added coffee, nuts, soy milk, baked beef, salad, seafood. Beta hydroxybutyrate steeply rises after meals in the range of about 3-7m M, and it decreases at night. This per - son's mood is exhilarating and active every day.The problem is that a low-sugar diet should become a high- protein or high-fat diet to compensate total energy expenditure. The long-term health effects of cohorts observed for more than 10 years show increased cancer and total death, both of which are un- desirable [37]. Too much protein puts a load on the kidneys, and too much fat is a risk of heart and vascular diseases. In particular, super carbo- hydrate restriction diet is limited to about 10% carbohydrate, there is a risk that the alanine was extracted from the muscle protein to maintain the glucose levels. In addition, intestinal bacteria is likely to change the symbiotic state with bacteria because the fermented bacteria is reduced and proteobacteria increases. Long-term tracking research is still a nec- essary stage. The recent advances in makeup methods are remarkable. The eyelashes like the actress of Takarazuka became widespread in To- kyo. There is also a sense of attention to the whole co-ordination, such as foundations and lipsticks. However, no matter how good the makeup is good, it is not the one to be able to conceal the un- healthy feeling and tired mind which oozes out from the core of the body. Japan has had a food-supporting route since the Edo period, and there is a trend to capture health as a holistic. It is shown in the repair record of the Nanboku in the middle of the Edo period that health is damaged if the lifestyle is not kept correctly. It is im- portant to live a stress-free life in a stressful modern society, and Buddha's eight-way road will be useful for it. In order to support our health, we have proposed a \"tetrahedron model\" that balances food, mind, and body and aims to lead a spiritual life. Spiritual life is something we can catch from thinking deeply about ourselves by breaking away from smartphone addiction.
