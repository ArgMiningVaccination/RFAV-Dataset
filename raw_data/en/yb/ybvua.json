It is a process open to the general public that is conducted early in the NEPA planning process. Public scoping can include meetings and mailings to educate the public on the project and on the planning process guidi ng the preparation of an EA. It also instructs the public on how to provide comments on the project. Af ter the public scoping period ends, the NPS uses an established protocol to analyze and summarize th e public comments received during the scoping period. The NPS uses this summary\u2014in addition to other releva nt law, policy, planning documents, and scientific literature\u2014to determine the scope of the EA. Point Reyes National Seashore (the park) held a public scoping period for the Ranch Comprehensive Management Plan/EA (Ranch CMP) from April 21, 2 014, to June 2, 2014. During this time, two open house meetings were held at different locations in the vicinity of the park. The public was encouraged to submit comments through the NPS's Planning, Environment, and Public Comment (PEPC) website (<http://parkplanning.nps .gov/pore>). Comments were also accepted at the meetings, by postal mail, and in person at the park. More than 3,000 pieces of correspondence were received during the public scoping period for this Ranch CMP. Additional detail is provide d in this report. This report describes the public scoping process for this Ranch CMP and presen ts the analysis and summary of public comments received. PUBLIC SCOPING FOR THE RANCH COMPREHENSIVE MANAGEMENT PLAN/ EA The public scoping period was open for a total of six weeks between April 21, 2014, and June 2, 2014. The NPS issued a press release to more than 25 Bay Area media outlets as well as to the Los Angeles Times on April 21, 2014, announcing the dates, ti mes, and places of the public scoping meetings. The NPS opened the public comment period for initial scoping on April 21, 2014. On that date, the NPS sent a scoping letter to more than 350 interested individuals and organizations notifying them of the opportunity to comment, and the NPS PEPC website (<http://par kplanning.nps.gov/pore>) was activated for the public to submit comments. Two public scoping open houses were held during the comment period at the following locations: May 6, 2014: Dance Palace Community Center, Point Reyes Station, California May 7, 2014: Bay Model Visito r Center, Sausalito, California A total of 178 people attended the two meetings (126 people attended the meeting at Point Reyes Station, and 52 attended the mee ting in Sausalito). At each meeting, the NPS provided handouts (see Appendix C), both in English and Spanish, which included information about the background of the project, proposed purpose and need, proposed plan objectives, issues, tule elk, best management practices (BMPs), potential impact topics, NEPA process, commonly asked questions, and information on how to comment, including directing comments to the NPS's PEPC website. This information was also disp layed on boards at each meeting venue. Park staff was available to answer questions and provide additi onal information to open house attendees. At least one Spanish interpreter was present at each meeting. Attendees at these public meetings were able to pr ovide comments both verbally and in writing. Flip charts to capture verbal comments in writing were set up at each venue along with the informational Point Reyes National Seashore 1 Ranch CMP September 2014 boards. Writing stations were also provided at each meeting where attendees could sit, write down their comments, and submit the form into a box. Computer stations were also available where attendees could access the NPS PEPC website to submit comments directly. Attendees also were welcome to submit into the provided boxes any written comments they had br ought with them. Comment forms could also be taken home and mailed later. During the scoping period, more than 3,000 pieces of correspondence were entered into the PEPC system. The PEPC system is a database that the NPS uses to analyze and summarize public scoping comments. Interested parties were encouraged to enter their comments directly into PEPC. NPS staff entered hard copies received at the public meetings, by postal mail, or in person at the park into PEPC. Flip chart comments for each of the two public meetings were entered into PEPC as a single piece of correspondence for each meeting. There is one correspondence from the first public meeting in Point Reyes Station, and one correspondence from the second public meeting in Sausalito. All correspondences are included on the park's Ranch CMP website at: http://www.nps.gov/pore/parkmgmt/planning_ranch_cmp.htm . DEFINITION OF TERMS Primary terms used in the document are defined below. Correspondence: A correspondence is the entire document received from a commenter. This includes letters; written comment forms; comments entered direc tly into PEPC; flip charts from the open houses; and any other written comments provided either at th e public scoping meetings, by postal mail, or in person at the park. Comment: A comment is a portion of the text within a correspondence that addresses a single subject. It could include such information as an expression of su pport or opposition for an alternative, additional data regarding the existing condition, or suggestions for resource topics to be considered. Code : A code is a grouping centered on a common subj ect. The codes were developed during the scoping process and are used to track major subjects. Concern : Concerns are statements that summarize the issues identified by each code. Each code was further characterized by concern statements to provide a better focus on the content of comments. Some codes required multiple concern statements, while others did not. In cases where no comments were received on an issue, the code was not identified or discussed in this report. Quotes: Representative quotes have been taken directly fro m the text of the comments received from the public and further clarify the concern statemen ts. Quotes have not been edited for grammar. COMMENT ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY Correspondence was received by hard copy letter via postal mail or delivered in person at the park, comment sheet submitted at the public meetings, oral st atements recorded on flip charts during the public meetings, or correspondence entered directly into the internet-based PEPC system. Letters received by email, through the postal mail, or submitted in person at the park, as well as the comments received from the public meetings, were entered into the PEPC system for analysis. Once all the correspondence was entered into PEPC, e ach was read, and specific comments within each unique correspondence were identified. Nearly 3, 000 comments were derived from the correspondence Point Reyes National Seashore 2 Ranch CMP September 2014 received. When identifying comments, every atte mpt was made to capture the full breadth of comments submitted. To categorize comments, each comment was given a c ode to identify the general content of a comment and to group similar comments. A total of 35 codes were used to categorize all of the public scoping comments received. An example of a code developed for this project is IT3000 - Impact Topic: Floodplains, Wetlands, Riparian Areas . In some cases, the same comment may be categorized under more than one code, reflecting the fact that the comment may contain more than one issue or idea. It should be noted that the impact topics brought up in the public scoping comments are unlikely to be the only topics considered in the Ranch CMP. Impact t opics to be considered in the Ranch CMP will be informed not only by the public comments but also by a number of other influences.

Table 1 provides a concise list of concern statements by code for quick referen ce. It is followed by the full concern report from PEPC, which incl udes representative quotes. Table 1: Code, Corresponding Concern ID, and Corresponding Concern Statement AL100 - Alternatives: Agriculture and Agricultural Leases Concern ID: 51732 Page 31 One commenter would like the Ranch CMP to consider an alternative lease term that supports the adoption of farming practices that are considered ecologically sustainable and provide financial and/or other incentives to ranchers for BMPs that provide environmental benefits. Concern ID: 51726 Page 31 Commenters stated that the Ranch CMP should consider an alternative that discontinues and phases out ranching and all lease/permits on the park. Alternative lease terms were suggested that included a phase out after 10 years and conditions on leases that would phase them out unle ss they can demonstrate t hat a specific individual lease/permit is an essential and positive addition to the nat ural resources of the park. Other suggestions included a competitive bid lease/permit process and buyouts to willing groups for the purpose of returning the lands to their former wildlife status. Concern ID: 51727 Page 33 Commenters stated that the Ranch CMP should consider an alternative to restore lands taken out of agriculture back to agricultural use and offer long-term, self-renewing or \"rolling\" lease/permits to ranchers with consistent standards for practices that allow di versity of agricultu ral activities. Concern ID: 51728 Page 34 Commenters made specific requests pertaining to their per sonal lease/permits. One submitted an application for a new special use permit (SUP) while the other stated that t hey were reinstating their first right of refusal on grazing rights. Concern ID: 51730 Page 34 Commenters would like the Ranch CMP to consider an al ternative that defines a process or guidelines for lease/permit succession to ensure the fu ture of ranching and farming at Point Reyes National Seashore and in Marin County. Concern ID: 51731 Page 35 Commenters would like the Ranch CMP to consider an alte rnative with lease regulations modeled on the Cuyahoga Valley National Park's \"Countryside Initiative.\" Concern ID: 51734 Page 36 Commenters stated that, during the development of alternatives, the Ranch CMP should consider establishing a set of transparent rules/regulations, goals, and actions that are applied consistently across all lease/permits, including: providing a consistent evaluation tool; enforcing account ability for non-compliance of rules/regulations; publically releasing residual dry matter (RDM) on an annual basis; ensu ring transparency of information of discounts offered to lease/permit holders along with rationale for offering disc ounts; providing incentives to ranchers the provide environmental services not required by lease/permit; and reevaluating of stocking rates. Commenters also suggested development of a mechanism to monitor and repair fences. One commenter stated that, during the development of alternatives, the Ranc h CMP should reassess the criteria for AUM allowed in lease/permits. Point Reyes National Seashore 11 Ranch CMP September 2014 Table 1: Code, Corresponding Concern ID, and Corresponding Concern Statement Concern ID: 51735 Page 38 Commenters stated that a r ange of lease/permit prices, terms and fees should be considered based on various factors, including: fair market value, income of ranche rs, commodity prices, financial viability of a ranch operation, number of cattle, and grazing area. One commenter indica ted that the Ranch CMP should consider an alternative that reduces lease prices for rancher s that are adversely affected by tule elk. Another commenter made several suggestions relating to lease/permits, including: conducting appraisals for AUM FMV annually with comparisons of discounts; having permits based on FMV, which include diffe rences in ranches; ensuring that homes are based on FMV; assessing ranch insurance as it relates to FMV; assessing the possessory tax as it relates to FMV; accruing cost recovery amount (CRA)-FMV after FMV charges with the difference going to the agriculture subsidy; and calculating the annual CRA needed to fund agriculture moni toring and mitigation. One commenter suggested that the Ranch CMP consider an alternative that streamlines the lease process. Concern ID: 51737 Page 40 Commenters indicated that the park needs to determine the length of lease/perm its. One commenter suggested that longer leases would encourage good stewardship among ranchers. Other commenters suggested shortening leases to one or two years. Concern ID: 51739 Page 40 One commenter stated that the Ranch CMP should clarify that the pastoral zone is not exclusively for agricultural use but also for natural resource protection and recommend a new description of \"pastoral zone.\" Concern ID: 51740 Page 41 Commenters stated that the Ranch CMP should consider an alternative that includes changes to lease boundaries as needed to manage natural resources th roughout the term of the lease/permit. Concern ID: 51741 Page 42 Commenters stated that the Ranch CMP should consider an alternative that includes a review of ranching operations to determine if a lease/permit area is compatible with a free-roaming tule elk herd. If so, the elk should not be disturbed or negativel y impacted on those lands. Concern ID: 51744 Page 42 One commenter stated that SUPs should quantify damage due to wildlife. Concern ID: 51746 Page 43 One commenter indicated that the NPS should clearly state in the Ranch CMP its intention to maintain the pastoral zone designation. Concern ID: 51747 Page 43 One commenter stated that lease/permit conditions should require several components, including: the protection of sensitive resources (through the use of exclusionary cattle fencing) and the enforcement of RDM requirements. Further, this commenter stated that the definition of AUM should be updated. Concern ID: 51748 Page 43 One commenter stated that no compensation or incentive shoul d be provided to ranchers for impacts from tule elk because the low lease/permit AUM and acreage provide adequate compensation. Concern ID: 51749 Page 43 One commenter stated that short- and long-term goals developed for leases should be based on science-based criteria. Concern ID: 51750 Page 44 One commenter suggested that the Ranch CMP provide a prov ision and process for formal public complaints related to non-compliance of lease terms and BMPs. Point Reyes National Seashore 12 Ranch CMP September 2014 Table 1: Code, Corresponding Concern ID, and Corresponding Concern Statement AL150 - Alternatives: Ranch Operations, Activities, and Management Concern ID: 51835 Page 44 Commenters provided support and suggestions regarding managing ranching operations related to forage and silage (including requirements for managing organically ce rtified livestock forage) such as: feeding animals from pasture; increasing the ability to grow more feed; using t ools including fire, mowing, grazing, and planting rangeland forages to preserve the grasslands; adjusting stocking rates to reflect available forage; preventing elk from consuming organic forage; returning pasture that has been taken out of production within the pastoral zone to ranching; and establishing a monitoring program for silage production and mowing. O ne commenter stated that these ranch management operations should be implemented immediately. Concern ID: 51836 Page 45 Commenters provided suggestions regarding managing ranc hing operations related to food storage, including requiring dairy workers to cover and monitor feed and water troughs to exclude corvids. Concern ID: 51837 Page 45 Commenters provided suggestions regarding managing ranching operations related to hazardous chemicals, including banning second-generation rat bait on ranches and minimizing the use of chemicals and pesticides. Concern ID: 51838 Page 46 Commenters provided suggestions regarding organic cert ifications, including implementing buffers for organic certification, assessing the value of or ganic certification, and actively suppo rting the pastoral zone to maintain organic operations Concern ID: 51839 Page 46 Commenters provided suggestions regarding managing ranc hing operations related to ranching fences, including removing abandoned fences, requiring wildlife-friendly fencing, and removing a pig fence. Concern ID: 51840 Page 47 Commenters provided suggestions regarding managing ranchi ng operations related to livestock treatment, including mandating humane methods for dehorning and banning the use of veal crates. Concern ID: 51841 Page 47 Commenters provided suggestions regarding ranching operations related to public awareness and education, including: promoting public awareness via a websit e; enhancing visitor and rancher education; adding a demonstration museum; adding visitor experience opportunities such as B&B farm stays, roadside stands and demonstration museums; and increased collaboration with ranchers. Concern ID: 51842 Page 47 Commenters provided suggestions regarding ranching oper ations related to waste, including banning compost until impacts to vegetation are proven, capturing methane from manure, and using anaerobic digesters (which could utilize climate-offset funding). Concern ID: 51843 Page 48 Commenters provided suggestions regarding ranching oper ations related to agricultural workers, including: encouraging overtime pay, clarifying that employee housing is available on-site, clarifying that sublets for non- agricultural employees are prohibited, publishing criteria for new operators, and improving living conditions. Concern ID: 51844 Page 48 Commenters provided suggestions regardi ng ranching operations related to diversification, including: only allowing diversification under certain circumstances, limiting diversif ication income to less than 20 percent of ranching/dairy income, clarifying that raising non-traditional livestock is diversification, never allowing on-site slaughtering; prohibiting row crops, and encouraging diversification. Point Reyes National Seashore 13 Ranch CMP September 2014 Table 1: Code, Corresponding Concern ID, and Corresponding Concern Statement Concern ID: 51845 Page 49 Commenters provided suggestions regarding ranching operations related to BMPs and implementing adaptive management. Suggestions relating to BMPs included: encour aging and incentivizing BMPs, harmonizing federal and state practices, utilizing management-in tensive grazing, and managing for carbon sequestration. One commenter also suggested that ranchers should be allowed to manage based on their knowledge of pasture, water, natural resources, and livestock operations. Concern ID: 51846 Page 50 Commenters suggested the park should further regulate mowing and blading of brush-lands. Other commenters suggested that there should be more control of invasive plants. Concern ID: 51847 Page 51 One commenter suggested that the park prohibit the use of ranch dogs. Concern ID: 51848 Page 51 Commenters suggested that permits for low-impact proj ects should not be required, that the permitting process should be quicker, and that processes for maintaining and repairing historic structures should be streamlined. Concern ID: 51849 Page 52 One commenter suggested that additional water sources should be sought. Concern ID: 51850 Page 52 One commenter suggested that the ranches inside the par k should be able to perform similar practices to those ranches outside the park. Concern ID: 51851 Page 52 One commenter advocated for specific operational change s and diversification at t he Lunny Ranch, including: restoration of dairy operations, enhancement of crop pr oduction, allowing for production and harvest of non-forage crops, restoration of hog and small chicken production, allo wing for building of new structures, allowing for on-farm sales, and providing new housing. Concern ID: 51852 Page 54 One commenter requested for specific operational allowa nces for the Drakes Bay Oyster Company, including: approving the development of retail and kitchen space to all of the ranchers to sell their products, and approving the addition of BBQ pits in existing picnic areas. Concern ID: 51863 Page 55 One commenter cited efforts to eliminate predator impacts to livestock utilizing non-lethal methods. Suggestions for managing predators included the use of guardian animals, fencing, and sound and/or lighting devices. Concern ID: 52152 Page 55 Commenters provided suggestions regarding managing ranc hing operations related to ranching infrastructure, including: repairing ranch roads to minimize sedimentation, invasive species, and fecal deliveries; allowing ranchers to mine gravel; repairing ranch infrastructure; clarifying that capital improvements must be done by SUP milestones; using sustainable power in new buildings; and staging emergency equipment at ranches to better prepare for emergencies. AL200 - Alternatives: Elk Management Concern ID: 51853 Page 57 Several commenters stated they would like the elk to be a llowed to stay in their historic range and to be protected within the park. Further, ranchers should coexist with the elk in the pastoral zone, and the management of a healthy tule elk population should be the priority. Commenters in su pport of the tule elk population also expressed support for the continued restoration and expansi on of a free-ranging tule elk population within the park and within the pastoral zone. Point Reyes National Seashore 14 Ranch CMP September 2014 Table 1: Code, Corresponding Concern ID, and Corresponding Concern Statement Concern ID: 51854 Several commenters suggested the use of immunocontraception as the appropria te tool for the management of the Page 59 tule elk population within the park because it is cost-e ffective and has been used in the past, including at the park and at other locations. One commenter also pointed out t hat lethal controls may resu lt in increased reproduction rates. Concern ID: 51855 Page 61 Commenters provided a variety of reasons as to why c onflicts between the elk and ranching activities need to be managed, including: challenges in meeting organic certific ation requirements, decreased availability of natural resources, interaction issues between cattle and elk, tr ansmission of disease, damage to ranch infrastructure, competition for forage, compounding impacts due to drought conditions (which justifies immediate action), and impacts to cultural resources. Commenters would like assessments of these impa cts to be included in the Ranch CMP. Several management methods for elk were suggested, including: relocation out of the pastoral zone, management of wilderness habitat, building and/or reinforcing fenc ing between the pastoral zone and the wilderness, compensating ranchers for elk damage and losses of forage, sterilization, hunting and distribution of meat, euthanizing of diseased elk, use of natural controls (starvation, disease, predatio n, etc.), reintrodu ction of predators, use of supplemental water resources to lure the elk, hazing, use of lease money to employ elk wranglers, increased staff for elk management, and reduction of herd size . Commenters would like cost/benefit assessments of these actions. Concern ID: 51856 Page 64 Some commenters stated that fencing woul d allow for coexistence of cattle and elk in the pastoral zone, indicating that fences should be constructed to contain cattle while allowing free movement of elk. These commenters indicated that the Ranch CMP should include a program to hel p ranchers install, monitor, and maintain these fences. Other commenters stated that the use of fencing to se parate the pastoral zone from the wilderness would not be effective because tule elk will find ways around fencing to inhabit their historic range. Concern ID: 51857 Page 65 Commenters indicated that a long-term elk management approach is needed immediately and should involve implementation of the 1998 Elk Management Plan, which the park has the authority to implement, to ensure the continuation of agriculture in the park. This plan does not authorize the movement of elk beyond the designated elk range. Further, commenters noted that all necessary analysis was completed for the 1998 management plan, and management, including compensation to ranchers for damages, should begin immediately. Concern ID: 51858 Page 66 Commenters indicated that management of the tule elk is needed as a result of issues pertaining to Johne's disease. One commenter suggested that the NPS assess the pres ence and transmission capacity of Johne's disease in wildlife and livestock, and stated that relocation of elk is not an option within the park due to the presence of disease. Therefore, elk must be harvested or moved to sufficiently remote locations to avoid spread of disease. Another commenter requested that the plan describe the history of Johne's disease in t he park, how it is tested for, and how it is managed. Point Reyes National Seashore 15 Ranch CMP September 2014 Table 1: Code, Corresponding Concern ID, and Corresponding Concern Statement Concern ID: 51859 Page 67 Several commenters advocated for lethal management such as hunting to be used as a means to control the elk population in the pastoral zone. Specific suggestions incl uded: hunt only elk that are causing damage, conduct limited hunts with ranchers selling tags and putting profits to ward infrastructure repair or habitat restoration, sell meat as a local food source, and donate meat to soup kitchens. Concern ID: 51860 Page 68 One commenter indicated that long-term hunting of elk sh ould not be a management option because the park would be committing to management activities that may not be reflective of the elk population at a given point in time. Concern ID: 51862 Page 68 Several commenters stated that only non-lethal and hum ane methods should be considered in the management of the tule elk population and provided detailed justification for the importance of using ethical management methods. Methods suggested include: fencing, exclosures, hazing, reproductive controls, Commenters indicated that only non- lethal management would be socially acceptable and su pported by the public. Other commenters further advocated for no harm in management, including no harassment or destruction of resources. Concern ID: 51866 Page 70 Commenters provided examples of spec ific wildlife management plans to prov ide guidance in the development of management of the tule elk population. Specific exampl es included: management of elephants at Kruger National Park in South Africa and management of tule elk by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife and the California National Guard. Concern ID: 51867 Page 71 Commenters would like to see tule elk herds recognized and managed as distinct herds with each managed for sustainability and balance between natural and cultural resour ces. One commenter suggested that the distinct herds should be managed by a third-party expert. Concern ID: 51871 Page 71 Commenters indicated that, particularly given unanticipated past events regarding the movement of the tule elk within the park, the Ranch CMP should include adaptive management measures. Concern ID: 51875 Page 72 One commenter suggested adjusting the ranch boundaries wi thin the pastoral zone to allow elk to roam in their preferred areas. Concern ID: 51877 Page 72 One commenter expressed opposition to the use of hazing of the elk within the pastoral zone, indicating that it causes damage to ranch infrastructure and creates costs to taxpayers. Concern ID: 51878 Page 72 One commenter expressed concern about the creation of wate r resources within the park, stating that this action requires a public decision process. The commenter further indicated that the Ranch CMP must evaluate the benefits of habitat enhancement within the elk range and the adverse impacts that would continue to result from habitat enhancement within the pastoral zone. Concern ID: 52163 Page 73 Commenters indicated that tule elk should be managed so that they do not occur in the pastoral zone. Some commenters further stated that the tule elk should be returned to the Lim antour wilderness and that their population numbers should be managed to appropriately reflect the carrying capacity of the land. AL300 - Alternatives: Other/New Elements Concern ID: 51889 Page 74 Commenters suggested several new alternatives and/or el ements relating to ranching such as: showcasing ranchers' stewardship practices to the community; developing a historic ranch complex at Tomales Point; clearly defining \"sustainable and ranchi ng education; and providing incentives to decrease carbon emissions. Point Reyes National Seashore 16 Ranch CMP September 2014 Table 1: Code, Corresponding Concern ID, and Corresponding Concern Statement Concern ID: 51891 Page 76 Commenters suggested considering several new alternativ es and/or elements relating to park management, park restoration, and visitor experience in the Ranch CMP, such as: creating a horse riding program for handicapped children; restoring the coastal prairie; increasing recreational opportunities, such as horseback riding, biking, and educational programs; prohibiting individual leaseholders from authorizing special events; increasing habitat for native wildlife; reintroducing extirpated species (black bear s, pronghorn, and squirrels); reducing the presence of non-native vegetation; protecting and restoring streams and riparian habitat; and developing alternative energy sources in the park. Concern ID: 51892 Page 78 Commenters suggested that connectivi ty and accessibility should be improved within the park. Many commenters suggested specific areas where trails should be improved or developed within agricultural areas of the park. Concern ID: 51898 Page 80 One commenter provided multiple suggestions for alter native elements, including: removing impoundment dams in former tidal areas; decommissioning unused ranch roads ; utilizing ground-penetrating radar to identify old dump sites (and to remediate those old dump sites); assessing t he feasibility of controlled burns in wilderness areas; posting maps of designated pastures and specific areas wi thin the pastoral zone (such as riparian areas); posting information regarding range management guidelines as well as information on SUPs, ranch milestones, and FMV; banning dogs on paths in proximity to livestock; and removing fencing in public rights-of-way. CC1000 - Consultation and Coordination: General Comments Concern ID: 51909 Page 80 Commenters suggested that several other agencies, entities, and stakeholders should be consulted with during preparation of the Ranch CMP, including the United St ates Department of Agriculture - Natural Resources Conservation Services (NRCS), Calif ornia Resources Agency, and Marin Count y Resources Conservation District (RCD), the Marin Humane Society, Un iversity of California Cooperative Extension (UCCE), the Point Reyes Seashore Ranchers Association, and the Marin County Agri cultural Commissioner. Other stakeholders that should be consulted include agronomists, wildlife experts, envi ronmental groups, and concerned citizens. One commenter emphasized that collaboration and partne rship between the NPS and the ranchers in the park is essential to the planning process. One commenter suggested topics that should be discussed by these parties in informal, trust-building working groups, including diversification of crops, rangeland impr ovements, invasive species, succession of rights, and elk management. Concern ID: 51910 Page 83 One commenter was concerned that preliminary agreem ents between the NPS and the ranchers have already occurred, and requested that these discussions and agreements should be communicated openly. Another commenter suggested that the planning process should be transparent. Concern ID: 51911 Page 84 One commenter suggested that public meetings should be held in San Francisco to reach a wider audience. Concern ID: 51912 Page 84 One commenter suggested that a formal public vote take place to determine whether ranching families should be allowed to stay on public lands. Concern ID: 51913 Page 84 One commenter stated that the relationship between the par k and the ranchers has been historically exemplary and that they would like to see this relationship continue. Point Reyes National Seashore 17 Ranch CMP September 2014 Table 1: Code, Corresponding Concern ID, and Corresponding Concern Statement Concern ID: 52182 Page 85 Commenters suggested that the NPS should form partnersh ips and/or advisory groups to help gather stakeholders' opinions and ideas. Concern ID: 52184 Page 87 One commenter made several suggestions regarding inform ation that should be included in the Ranch CMP, including: define the current and desired conditions for all l ands within the pastoral zone while offering strategies to meet desired conditions; include maps of soils, vegetat ive communities, wildlife habitats, water resources, and livestock use areas; include a map and tabulation of range development; and provide a background of grazing documenting the amount of public money that was used for the buyout and explaining the terms and conditions. IS1000 - Issues: Environmental Baseline Conditions Concern ID: 51782 Page 88 Commenters stated that the baseline for consideration of environment al impacts under the Ranch CMP should include current lease requirements and should not includ e the occurrence of tule elk in the pastoral zone. Commenters also questioned how the baseline would address the removal and forage consumption of exotic deer. Concern ID: 51831 Page 89 Commenters stated that, because ranching and farming activi ties have occurred in the area for 150 years, these activities represent the baseline condition for the Ranc h CMP. One commenter suggested that the Ranch CMP fully describe the need for the NEPA process at this time to cont inue current ranching operation s that have occurred for a 150-year timeframe while there was not a requirement for NEPA for past changes of land us e in the park. Concern ID: 52174 Page 90 Commenters presented several elements that need to be asse ssed and explained pertaining to the tule elk in the park, including: assess the presence and transmission capa city of Brucellosis in wildlife and livestock, provide data on the weight of elk, determine the am ount of forage consumed by elk and lives tock, determine the amount of other feed eaten by elk, address the claim of the occurrence of elk stabbing livesto ck with antlers, explore the possibility that the elk population is self-regulat ing and not in need of management, explore the claim that elk will starve if moved from the pastoral zone, address the claim that the park moved the el k into the pastoral zone, assess the impacts from extensive fencing, assess the success of using water to lure elk from cattle areas, and assess the success of fencing around ponds to exclude elk. One comment er would like the park to provide specific information pertaining to the tule elk, including: the location of impacts; a description of impacts to ranching operations; a description of the nature and extent of impacts to pastures; a description of how water is provided to cattle, how the elk are accessing this water, and how much of this wate r is being consumed; and a description of what hazing methods are being used and their efficacy. Concern ID: 52225 Page 91 One commenter requested further information on cattle gr azing, including cattle numbers and amounts of vegetation consumed during different times of the year. They further requested current grazing information to be presented with an inventory of fences, corrals, water developments, use of supplements movement of cattle and more information on the relationship between grazing on various land allotments, how much area is covered in cattle pats, and disclosure of the total effluent discharges. Point Reyes National Seashore 18 Ranch CMP September 2014 Table 1: Code, Corresponding Concern ID, and Corresponding Concern Statement IS1100 - Issues: Ranch Operations, Activities, and Management (past, present, and future) Concern ID: 51870 Page 92 Commenters noted that ranchers have been a part of the landscape for generations and that maintaining agriculture in the park is important to agriculture both locally and nationally. Because farmers and ranchers in West Marin County are pioneers in sustainable and organic practices, agric ulture in this area is critical to the future of the national food supply. Additionally, maintaining agriculture in the park is important to maintaining the support services, marketing opportuni ties, and economic sustainab ility for agriculture locally. Concern ID: 51832 Page 94 Commenters expressed concern over current ranching condit ions including cruelty to animals, use of antibiotics, impacts to wildlife and wildlife habitat, impacts to water quality, impacts to soils, impacts to air quality, and contributions to climate change. Commenter s also expressed concern for preference for a non-native species, cattle, over native species. Concern ID: 51834 Page 95 One commenter expressed concern over the impacts to ranch operations related to climate change and the predicted variability in rainfall. Another commenter noted that drought condit ions have already caused impacts to ranch operations resulting in the need to purchase additional feed. Concern ID: 51873 Page 95 One commenter noted that mowing and windrowing of grasses is critical for controlling weeds and improving pasture quality thereby reducing reliance on imported feeds. Concern ID: 52219 Page 96 Commenters provided information regarding the history and background of ra nching and agriculture in the area indicating that these practices provide economic, employment, and educational benefits. Broader benefits that were noted included the contribution to preserva tion of regional agriculture and economies. Concern ID: 52221 Page 97 One commenter expressed concern over future actions threaten the continuation of agriculture in the park and therefore threaten the larger county. They suggested that the NPS should assess the cumulative impact of park- based agriculture on the viability of agriculture county-wide. Concern ID: 52223 Page 97 One commenter expressed concern over future actions threaten the continuation of agriculture in the park and therefore threaten the larger county. They suggested that the NPS should assess the cumulative impact of park-based agriculture on the viability of agriculture county-wide. IS1150 - Issues: Agriculture and Agriculture Leases (past, present, and future) Concern ID: 51881 Page 97 One commenter indicated that, due to the short-term nature of SUPs, it is economically unfeasible for ranchers to undertake costly, long-term management actions on their pr operty. Another commenter stated that, due to existing permit language, ranching operations are not properly appraised because they often do not take into account capital improvements. Concern ID: 51876 Page 98 Many commenters stated that ranchers have already been paid for their land, their leases have expired, and they are currently paying artificially low lease prices that are being subsidized by the ta xpayers. Commenters further noted that these lands do not belong to the ranchers, but rather belong to the public, are open to the public and wildlife, and that subsidies are no longer justified. Point Reyes National Seashore 19 Ranch CMP September 2014 Table 1: Code, Corresponding Concern ID, and Corresponding Concern Statement Concern ID: 51880 Page 99 One commenter stated that the 20-year lease terms do not take into account economic uncertainties and that these ranches in the park may not be economically feasible in the future. Another commenter stated that short-term permits create uncertainty and make ranch improvements difficult. This combined with any decrease in grazing acreage or competition for forage by elk threatens the organic production and the economic stab ility of the ranches. IS1200 - Issues: Cultural Resource Management (past, present, and future) Concern ID: 51882 Page 100 Commenters noted that the 1980 GMP allows for agricultural practices to occur in the park. They also noted that the Point Reyes Ranches and the Olema Valley Ranches have been found to be eligible for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places as Histor ic Districts, and that the park should reco gnize the pastoral areas of the park as \"continuing cultural landscapes.\" Ranches are also eligible for designation as United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage Sites. Concern ID: 51883 Page 101 Commenters suggested that the Ranch CMP consider remova l of tule elk from the pastoral zone and develop a plan for managing the ranches to ensure the long-term viability of agriculture in these Historic Districts. Management should include: fencing elk out of the Historic Ranc hing Districts; managing ranches as defined by UNESCO World Heritage Sites; and creating a contract with a nonprofit co rporation for services similar to those provided by the Cuyahoga Valley National Park's nonprofit partner. Concern ID: 51884 Page 103 One commenter suggested that preservation of the divers e cultural landscape at Point Reyes National Seashore should be given importance equal to preservation of historic structures located at the park. Concern ID: 51885 Page 103 Commenters stated that, without the full support by the NPS regarding reques ts made by the ranchers within the park, the NPS is contributing to the loss of a cultural resource. Concern ID: 51886 Page 103 One commenter asked for prioritization for the preservation of native American cultural sites. Concern ID: 52193 Page 104 One commenter suggested that ranchers would provide env ironmental improvements beyo nd those required in the leases should be reimbursed through credits on the leases. IS1300 - Issues: Natural Resource Management (past, present, and future) Concern ID: 51890 Page 104 Commenters stated that the Ranch CMP should consider the value of grazing to preserve and restore native grasslands in the park and in Golden Gate National Recreat ion Area and to reopen lands previously taken out of agriculture to ranching operations for lease/permit. Concern ID: 51887 Page 105 Commenters stated that the natural resources present in the park should be protected and preserved. Concern ID: 51888 Page 105 Commenters indicated that natural resources management cannot be applied within the cultural landscape in the same way that this management is applied elsewhere in the park and suggested that the Ranch CMP include a discussion of how natural resources management will be dealt with on agricultural lands. IS1400 - Issues: Tule Elk Management on Ranchlands (past, present, and future) Point Reyes National Seashore 20 Ranch CMP September 2014 Table 1: Code, Corresponding Concern ID, and Corresponding Concern Statement Concern ID: 51893 Page 105 Several commenters stated that ranchers do not have the right to impact the elk and provided reasons for elk to remain in the area, including: they are the native grazers a nd belong in the area, they serv e an important role to the ecosystem, they represent an important species to conserva tion history, the land belongs to the public and to the wildlife, and the elk resided in this area long before people. These commenters also expressed concern that ranching activities are impacting the elk and that threat s exist to their health if they are not properly managed. Concern ID: 51894 Page 107 One commenter discussed the status of the tule elk as an \"umbrella\" species that repr esents long-term restoration efforts in California that should be given priority ov er cattle grazing. The same commenter described the reintroduction of the elk to Tomales Point as a historical note to the restoration of the species and to the future of restoration ecology in general. Concern ID: 51896 Page 108 Several commenters stated that elk are threatening r anchers' ability to raise quality food and meet consumer demand with impacts that include: damage to fences, damage to water sources, damage to irrigation lines, spread of disease, impacts to grazing and native pastures, impacts to organic forage and certifications, and threats to the economic survival of ranches due to costs incurred from elk impacts. Concern ID: 51897 Page 108 One commenter stated that claims of ca lf goring by elk are unsubstantiated. Concern ID: 51899 Page 108 Commenters stated that the ex ponential growth of the elk population in the absence of hunting and predation, which historically kept the population under control, is a problem that is likely to destroy natural habitat. Concern ID: 51900 Page 109 One commenter questioned background information provided in scoping materials, indicating that ranchers and the public had raised concerns related to tule elk and their impacts on ranch operations. Concern ID: 51901 Page 109 One commenter noted that, prior to 2002, the NPS managed elk following the 1998 Elk Management Plan to avoid harm to other permitted uses, but in 2002, this management ceased. Concern ID: 51902 Page 110 One commenter stated that a map being used in the current Ranch CMP materials is misleading because it does not include the designated elk range. Concern ID: 51903 Page 110 One commenter noted that there is no research indicating that elk are eating grass needed by cattle, and there is therefore no valid claim by the ranchers that they ar e being put out of business by elk grazing in the area. IT1000 - Impact Topic: Geological Resources (erosion, stream incision, streambanks/streambeds, quarries) Concern ID: 51906 Page 111 Commenters noted that the Ranch CMP should address the impacts of ranching operations including changes to soil compaction and structure, soil erosion, soil biology, in creased nitrogen deposition, surface and subsurface water quality, contribution to GHG emissions, waste disposal, and an increase in invasive species. Commenters stated that BMPs should be evaluated for soil management, tops oil preservation, and prevention of erosion. One commenter noted that previous efforts to protect from these impacts involved annual measurements of residual dry matter. One commenter stated that the Ranc h CMP should describe the current conditions of water quality and quantity in the project area and evaluate cons istency with the Organic Act providing \"maximum protection, restoration, and preservation\" to natural resources, and consider va rious published sources of information including a paper discussing off-stream water sources and erosion for cattle. Point Reyes National Seashore 21 Ranch CMP September 2014 Table 1: Code, Corresponding Concern ID, and Corresponding Concern Statement IT1100 - Impact Topic: Water Quality and Quantity Concern ID: 51907 Page 112 Commenters stated that the Ranch CMP should assess and describe direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts of ranching operations to water resources resulting from point source and non-point source runoff of contaminants into Tomales Bay, Drakes Estero, tributaries, stock ponds, and other surface waters throughout the area, noting that nitrates and microbial pathogens (such as fecal coliform bacteria) are of particular concern. The Ranch CMP should set water quality standards and develop an ongoing monitoring plan to provide data for adaptive management of BMPs. This plan should include: setting goals for contaminant loading from cattle operations; assessing ways to control both point source and non-point source impacts; explaining how \"top priority\" tributaries are determined; explaining how water quality is assessed; and developing a cumulative watershed effects analysis that includes an explanations of past survey efforts. IT1200 - Impact Topic: Floodplains, Wetlands, Riparian Areas Concern ID: 51916 Commenters stated that ranchers at t he park have in the past and are currently using measures to reduce impacts Page 114 to floodplains, wetlands, and riparian areas, including: using buffers for water quality protection and sensitive riparian areas; enhancing habitat in sensitive riparian and wetl and areas; and committing under the existing status quo to continue their partnerships with agencies and organi zations to reduce negative environmental impacts. Concern ID: 51914 Page 115 Commenters stated that past, present, and future direct and indirect impacts to riparian areas, aquatic features, and developed waters (such as increased sediments, increased le vels of fecal coliform bacteria, changes to hydrology, breakdown of streambanks, disturbanc e of streambeds, degradation of ripar ian vegetation, changes to nutrient cycling, and thermal effects) should be analyzed, including creating maps of the resources and documenting the current condition of the water resource s. Mitigation to stabilize and restore streambanks, to monitor water quality against performance standards, and to restore riparian areas, including the establishment of buffer areas, should be developed. Impacts from water supply development should be assessed. A mitigation, restoration, and monitoring plan and timeline to achieve water quality standards should be presented. Commenters noted that cattle should be prohibited from entering water resources, and runo ff from ranch operations should be eliminated. IT1300 - Impact Topic: Species of Special Concern (plant or anim al; federally listed or proposed for listing or their habitat; state listed) Concern ID: 51919 Page 117 One commenter stated that livestock grazing has been shown to be compatible with, or to enhance, the habitat for a significant number of special-stat us grassland species on park lands. Concern ID: 51917 Page 117 Commenters provided a list of specie s they felt should be considered in the development of the Ranch CMP and requested that the plan include: a discussion of the endang ered and threatened animals and plants that exist in the grazing areas; the threats to them in those areas from cattle and other causes; an assessment of potential direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts from the implementation of the Ranch CMP to the sp ecies; and how the Ranch CMP will remediate impairment. They also requested that critical habitat be designated within the pastoral zone and that these areas be removed from the pastoral zone. One commenter stated that the Ranch CMP should provide maximum protection to federal and state listed wildlife and plant species and their habitats. Point Reyes National Seashore 22 Ranch CMP September 2014 Table 1: Code, Corresponding Concern ID, and Corresponding Concern Statement Concern ID: 51920 Page 123 Commenters stated that the scope of the Ranch CMP should only evaluat e new impacts, and changes from the status quo, of ranching operations to species of special concern (plant or animal; federally listed or proposed for listing or their habitat; state listed). They further stated that ranching is part of the baseline, and as such, should not be evaluated in this Ranch CMP. IT1400 - Impact Topic: Fish and Wildlife and Associated Habitat (including non-native wildlife and fish species; not including tule elk) Concern ID: 51921 Page 123 Commenters stated that the Ranch CMP should describe and assess the impacts of ranching operations to fish and wildlife and associated habitat, including: impacts to breedi ng birds resulting from mowing and subsequent predation and impacts to wildlife species (and the public) resulting fr om the use of electric fencing. Further, commenters requested that the Ranch CMP describe the habitat that ranc hers provide and the species that utilize these habitats, as well as the habitat needs of wildlife species within the park. Commenters also requested that the Ra nch CMP broaden the scope to include analyses of all native species within the park (other than the tule elk). Concern ID: 51922 Page 124 Commenters indicated that the Ranch CMP appears to be fo cusing on an approach that neglects federal and state listed species and their habitats, stating that the NPS should focus on preservation and restoration of listed and native species (including the pronghorn) and that any commercial operation that is not compatible with this focus should be removed. IT1500 - Impact Topic: Tule Elk (not relating to management) Concern ID: 51924 Page 125 One commenter asked for an explanation of the im pacts on elk as a result of ranch operations. Concern ID: 51925 Page 125 One commenter requested an explanation of elk habitat needs, feeding habits, and where they overlap with cattle. Concern ID: 51926 Page 125 Several commenters provided details about the history of elk in the area over the past 10,000 years and the change in population numbers. One commenter requested additional in formation on their history including specific numbers and ecosystem services that they provide. Concern ID: 52167 Page 126 One commenter presented several specific questions perta ining to the management of the elk population, including the following requests: provide information on possible model management plans, describe the role of state agencies (such as the California Department of Fish and Wi ldlife) in management of the park elk population, provide information on what a healthy elk population looks like in the Limantour wilderness (including optimal herd size in varying climatic conditions and measures to maintain a se lf-sustaining herd without predators), provide information on all of the potential management tools to maintain an optim al herd size (such as culling, fertility control, moving elk, fencing, and periodic burns), provide a discussion on potential fencing methods to keep elk out of the pastoral zone, provide a discussion on methods to prevent the transmission of disease to cattle, and provide a discussion of BMPs needed to sustain the optimal herd. Point Reyes National Seashore 23 Ranch CMP September 2014 Table 1: Code, Corresponding Concern ID, and Corresponding Concern Statement IT1600 - Impact Topic: Vegetation (including dunes and non-native plant species) Concern ID: 51929 Commenters would like the Ranch CMP to analyze the benefits of using ranch operations such as grazing, tilling, Page 127 mowing, mechanical harvesting, fencing, and other agri cultural practices on the control and management of non- native invasive plants within the park. One commenter also requested that the Ranc h CMP study the benefits of utilizing herbicides, indicating that the us e of some herbicides may be necessary. Concern ID: 51927 Page 127 Commenters stated that the Ranch CMP should evaluate and describe the past and present extent of exotic and invasive plant species in the project area and the impacts of exotic and invasive plant species to native coastal prairie at the park. The influence of cattle grazing on the presence, spread, and potential control of exotic and invasive plant species should also be analyzed. Inform ation on the past extent of these species was provided. Commenters also indicated that the Ranch CMP should analyze the effects of alternatives on invasive species actions. Concern ID: 51930 Page 129 Commenters expressed concern over the brush encroach ment that has resulted from changes in management practices (such as cessation of grazing and mowing in an area that is no longer under a lease/permit agreement) and indicated that impacts may include: changing fire r egimes and creating increased fire threats; altering water availability; causing changes to vegetat ion structure; creating access issues for visitors; and changing the cultural landscape. Commenters requested that the Ranch CMP evaluate the history of brush management in the park and consider the benefits (including water quality benefits and reduction in fire danger) of allowing ranchers to control invasive brush in their pasture lands. Concern ID: 51932 Page 130 Commenters stated that the Ranch CMP should consider restoration of native plant communities including coastal prairie. Restoration measures considered should include providing additional lands for restoration, such as lands around Drakes Head. Concern ID: 51934 Page 131 Commenters stated that the Ranch CMP should assess bot h the impacts and benefits of ranching operations on habitats and vegetation, including dunes and non-native plant species. Benefits express ed by commenters included: maintenance of complex vegetation, the use of ranching operations as a tool fo r the conservation, and restoration of native species. Some impacts described by commenters included: alteration of dominant vegetation species, alteration of the fire regime, increased spread of exotic species, and compaction of soils leading to decreased infiltration and water availability. Concern ID: 51935 Page 132 Commenters stated that the Ranch CMP should consider the use of fire as a management tool for invasive species management, brush management, and native vegetation rest oration both in ranchlands and wilderness, and should assess the benefits of fire manag ement to the human environment. Concern ID: 51936 Commenters stated that the Ranch CM P should address the impacts of dune management to plant and animal Page 133 species and ranching operations, includi ng the removal of non-native vegetation from dunes, the impacts on organic certification resulting from using herbicides on non-native grasses, and how blowing sand from the dunes impacts pastureland. Point Reyes National Seashore 24 Ranch CMP September 2014 Table 1: Code, Corresponding Concern ID, and Corresponding Concern Statement Concern ID: 51937 Page 133 Commenters explained that plant species once found in the coastal prairie have been largely replaced by non-native species over the past 150 years of land use and stated that the Ranch CMP should evaluate the impacts that vegetation restoration would have on ranching operations. IT1800 - Impact Topic: Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Climate Change Concern ID: 51942 Page 134 Commenters stated that the Ranch CMP should assess im pacts of climate change on ranching operations in the area, including impacts from: changes in weather pat terns, extreme weather events, and sea level rise. Concern ID: 51941 Page 135 Commenters stated that ranching operat ions contribute to air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and climate change and that the Ranch CMP should describe mitigation measures to address these impacts. Further, the Ranch CMP should discuss compliance with the Clean Air Act and regional Air Quality Management District guidelines, citing ammonia and noxious gas production as air quality concerns. IT1900 - Impact Topic: Visual/Aesthetic Resources Concern ID: 51943 Page 136 Commenters stated that the Ranch CMP should describe impacts of ranching operations on visual/aesthetic resources including muddy areas and the smell of ranching operations. IT2000 - Impact Topic: Cultural Resources including Historic Ranc hing Districts, Cultural Landscap es, and Prehistoric/Historic Structures Concern ID: 51945 Page 136 Commenters stated that the Ranch CMP should assess the ranching operations and their associated activities as a cultural resource including historic ranching districts, cultural landscapes, historic vernacular landscapes, and ranching families. Some commenters noted that the ranche s have designed cultural landscapes that must be retained and that the change in these landscapes should be considered features of these landscapes. Concern ID: 51944 Page 138 Commenters stated that the Ranch CMP should describe cultural resources within the pastoral zone and provide a review of existing inventories while analyzing the effe cts to these resources. Co mmenters noted that physical, chemical, and erosional impacts to archeological and cultural sites are of particular concern. Commenters noted that the Ranch CMP should describe management and monitoring protocols to protect these resources, specifically mentioning the Secretary of the Inte rior's Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties with Guidelines for the Treatment of Cultural Landscapes. IT2200 - Impact Topic: Socioeconomic Resources Concern ID: 51953 Page 139 Commenters noted the importance of historic ranches to local communities stating t hat they are essential to sustaining local economies through direct job creation and indirect job creation (via support industries such as distributors, veterinarians, etc.) and that they are important contribut ors to sustainable food production. Concern ID: 51950 Page 140 Commenters stated that the Ranch CMP should consider how additional or new requirements (monitoring, reporting, etc.) would impact the economic viability of ranch operatio ns in the park, and also consider the reuse of some ranches that have gone out of operation. Point Reyes National Seashore 25 Ranch CMP September 2014 Table 1: Code, Corresponding Concern ID, and Corresponding Concern Statement Concern ID: 51951 Page 140 One commenter stated that economic impacts to nearby communities resulting from ranching activities at the park should be assessed in the Ranch CMP. Concern ID: 51952 Page 140 One commenter indicated that agriculture activities with in the park represent a small contribution to the overall agricultural value of the surrounding counties and that remo val of operations within the park would have little impact on agricultural revenue in the area. IT2300 - Impact Topic: Visitor Use, Experience, and Recreation Concern ID: 51958 Page 141 One commenter stated that the Ranch CMP should evaluate t he benefit to the visitor experience of having a public interpretive center and educational programs within the ranching community that celebrates the working landscape. Concern ID: 51954 Page 141 Commenters stated that ranching operations result in impacts, both adverse and beneficial, to visitor use, experience, and recreation. B enefits include experiencing the landscape, t he wildlife, and the ranching community as a valuable historic resource. Concerns with ranching operations at the park included access restrictions on ranches, impacts and access to trails and other park resources, visual intrusions, the smell of ranch operations, and inconsistency with expectations of wilderness. The Ranch CMP should consider strategies that would improve the condition of public trails in the pastoral zone and address current degraded trail conditions while offsetting losses to ranchers. Concern ID: 51959 Page 143 One commenter stated that ranchers are willing to cooper ate with the park in preser ving existing public access through the ranch lands, but that any additional access co uld result in infrastructure challenges and changes in livestock behavior that could threaten the visitor experience and pose safety concerns for the visiting public. Concern ID: 52159 Page 143 Commenters stated that opportunities exis t at the oyster farm to take tours and purchase products and at B Ranch to participate in farm stays and that offering these opportunities more broadly within the park would enhance the visitor experience and produce income for the ranchers. Concern ID: 52169 Page 144 One commenter cited the significance of the tule elk to visitor experience within the park and indicated that public attitudes should be assessed in the development of the Ranch CMP. IT2400 - Impact Topic: Health and Safety Concern ID: 51960 Page 145 Commenters suggested that the impact topic for health and safety related to operator and worker housing should be dismissed due to existing standards and inspection protocols in place and adherence to corrective measures required. IT2500 - Impact Topic: Wilderness Concern ID: 51963 Page 145 One commenter stated that the Wilderness Act allows for certain domestic livestock grazing operations to continue in areas that were established prior to designation of those areas as wilderness as long as operations are consistent with the preservation of the wilderness character. Th e commenter noted that grazing in wilderness has been set aside by court rulings in the past where agencies have failed to address impacts to wilderness conditions. Concern ID: 51961 Page 146 Commenters suggested that the park sh ould not be considered wilderness due to previous road and housing within the park. Concern ID: 51964 Page 146 One commenter stated that designated wilderness should not be manipulated as a part of management actions and that no structures should be authorized that would diminish management of this area as wilderness. Point Reyes National Seashore 26 Ranch CMP September 2014 Table 1: Code, Corresponding Concern ID, and Corresponding Concern Statement IT2600 - Impact Topic: Park Operations Concern ID: 51965 Page 147 Commenters stated that the Ranch CMP should describe current and future park operations related to ranching operations, including regulatory oversight as well as su pervision and management of tule elk population on ranchlands. Commenters also questioned how much m anagement of the tule elk population would be needed (monitoring, fencing, etc.) in the abs ence of agricultural activities, and suggested the Ranch CMP should describe the cost incurred by the NPS to perform oversight and s upervision of ranching operations and management of tule elk on ranchlands and in the pastoral zone. The Ranch CMP should also disclose what chemicals are used in the pastoral zone. IT2700 - Other/New Impact Topics Concern ID: 51967 Page 149 Commenters noted that not all lands in the pastoral zone are capable of sustaining livestock and stated that the park must determine the current carrying capa city of these lands for grazing. One commenter noted that, without this evaluation, and the decision that non-native cattle belong here, the park ca nnot make an appropriate assessment as to whether grazing is an appropriate land use in this area. Concern ID: 52171 Page 150 One commenter expressed concern over the possibility of el k leaving the park, which woul d result in added pressure on the state fish and wildlife agency. The commenter indi cated that the Ranch CMP should plan for this potential outcome. Additionally, this commenter would like data sh ared pertaining to the movement of the elk herds. ON1000 - Other NEPA Issues: General Comments Concern ID: 51968 Page 150 Commenters suggested that a full Environmental Impact Statement should be completed. One commenter noted that the public scoping newsletter gave the impression that the NPS has predetermined its course of action. Concern ID: 51969 Page 151 One commenter suggested that the NPS should improve its method for accepting public comments, particularly the NPS should allow comments that are emailed, and that the PEPC webpage should be able to accept formatted comments and attachments. Concern ID: 51970 Page 151 One commenter suggested, per NEPA regulations, that the management of Tule elk and all livestock grazing-related infrastructure must be considered in the scope of this Ranch CMP. Concern ID: 51971 Page 152 One commenter suggested that the proposed project does not require the NPS to proceed with an EA to comply with NEPA to modify the duration of the leases, beca use NPS NEPA regulations include a categorical exclusion from further NEPA review for renewals of permits that do not entail new construction or any potential for new environmental impact. Concern ID: 52233 Page 153 Commenters state that the 1998 Elk Management Plan pr ovides the needed guidance to address the current presence of elk in the pastoral zone, that a new NEPA analysis is unnecessary to address the issue, and that the NPS should apply the alternative adopted in the 1998 Elk Management Plan PN1000 - Purpose and Need: Planning Process and Policy Concern ID: 51973 Page 153 Commenters suggested that the NPS wo rks too slowly and should shorten t he review process for the Ranch CMP and the publication of the decision document. Concern ID: 51974 Page 154 One commenter suggested that the Point Reyes Seashore Ranc hers association is not a legal entity, and that this Association has been given too much power in decision-making processes. Point Reyes National Seashore 27 Ranch CMP September 2014 Table 1: Code, Corresponding Concern ID, and Corresponding Concern Statement Concern ID: 51975 Page 154 One commenter suggested rnal elk-proof fencing, forced removal/relocation of Tule elk within the park, and the conversion of grazing lands into cultivation- agriculture are in conflict with NEPA and NPS regulations. PN2000 - Purpose and Need: Park Purpose and Significance Concern ID: 51977 Page 155 One commenter suggested that the park was established to include the agricultural/pastoral region of the park, and that long-term lease agreements should be established and upheld. They suggested that allowing long term rolling 20 year leases is necessary to maintain long term farm ing operations, as well as commitments from farm supply business, lenders, and other community support organizations. Concern ID: 51830 Page 155 One commenter stated that the enabling legislation for t he park did not identify the existing pastoral zone or permanent commercial cattle operations. The pastoral zone, allowing for specific regulated commercial operations, was incorporated in the 1998 Management Plan and did not ex clude native wildlife from occurring in this area. Concern ID: 51976 Page 156 Commenters suggested that the park is fo r wildlife, not for ranchers. Commenter s also stated that agricultural uses should only be allowed if they are deemed appropriate and do not impair park resources. One commenter stated that agricultural leases held by individuals who have no di rect bloodline to the original owners should be terminated immediately. Concern ID: 51978 Page 157 One commenter suggested that the park should be referred to as a National Seashore in all publications and communications with the public. PN8000 - Purpose and Need: Objectives In Taking Action Concern ID: 51979 Page 158 Commenters suggested that the Ranch CMP should educate the public about the compatibility of farming and nature by highlighting farm sustainability, marketing, and local production and consumption of the regional agricultural products. Other commenters suggested that an objective of the Ranch CMP should be to ensure that the ranches continue to be economically viable, and to mitigat e adverse impacts from Tule elk on ranches. Other specific objectives suggested by commenters included: favoring native annual wildflowers and perennial grasses, developing unique gastronomic resources, encouraging sustainable ag ricultural practices, providing a framework for cooperation between hikers and ranchers, and allowing current practices to continue while allowing for diversification. Concern ID: 51980 Page 159 Commenters suggested that the Ranch CMP objectives lack sp ecificity, stating specific information that needs clarification, including: additional details rega rding any anticipated actions of the Ranch CMP. Concern ID: 51981 Page 159 Commenters suggested that the Ranch CMP include additional objectives, including: to assess whether confined animal facilities and other rangeland operations are o perating in compliance with current federal and state regulations; to address carbon sequestrat ion; to discontinue European cattle operat ions in the park; to protect Tule elk; to clarify NPS expectations and rancher commitments; and to restore agricultural activities in the Olema Valley and Point Reyes Historic Ranch District s where they historically existed. Concern ID: 51982 Page 161 One commenter stated that materials prepared to educate the public on the Ranch CMP prior to commenting were misleading in that they imply that the park already has a plan objective to keep the elk in the pastoral zone. Point Reyes National Seashore 28 Ranch CMP September 2014 Table 1: Code, Corresponding Concern ID, and Corresponding Concern Statement PO1000 - Park Operations: Guiding Policies, Regs and Laws Concern ID: 51984 Page 161 One commenter requested that the park make available the or iginal transfer documents for grazing properties in the park. Another commenter suggested re evaluating the grazing leases according to statutes 459-459/C7. RF1000 - References: Suggested References Concern ID: 51985 Page 161 Additional references regarding wildlife-friendly fencin g, stewardship and engagement, the management of historic properties, sustainable agriculture, and diversification should be reviewed and considered during the preparation of the Ranch CMP. Point Reyes National Seashore 29 Ranch CMP September 2014 [This page intentionally left blank.] Point Reyes National Seashore 30 Ranch CMP September 2014 PUBLIC SCOPING COMMENT SUMMARY The following report is organized by codes and then concern statements. Representative quotes are provided for each concern statement. Representative quotes are taken directly from PEPC exactly as it was entered from text provided by the commenters. Grammar and spelling have not been changed. These representative quotes are not the only comments received under a particular concern stat ement; rather, these quotes have been chosen to represent those comments categorized under each concern statement. AL100 - Alternatives: Agriculture and Agricultural Leases Concern ID: 51732 CONCERN One commenter would like the Ranch CMP to consider an alternative lease STATEMENT: term that supports the adoption of farming practices that are considered ecologically sustainable and provide financial and/or other incentives to ranchers for BMPs that prov ide environmental benefits. Representative Quote(s): Corr. ID: 2960 Organization: Marin Conservation League Representative Quote: Consider lease terms that support lessees in the continued adoption of farming practices considered to be ecologically sustainable, including organic and carbo n-beneficial practices. In order to encourage a sustainable combination of agricultural land uses, allow a diversity of food and fiber crops, as appropriate in existing soils and water regimes. Provide financial and/or other incentives to ranchers for \"best management practices\" that provide part icular environmental benefits, such as intensive grazing to restore native grasses or application of compost for carbon sequestration. Concern ID: 51726 CONCERN Commenters stated that the Ranch CMP sh ould consider an alternative that STATEMENT: discontinues and phases out ranching and all lease/permits on the park. Alternative lease terms were suggested th at included a phase out after 10 years and conditions on leases that would phase them out unless they can demonstrate that a specific individual le ase/permit is an essential and positive addition to the natural resources of the park. Other suggestions included a competitive bid lease/permit process and buyouts to willing groups for the purpose of returning the lands to their former wildlife status. Representative Quote(s): Corr. ID: 867 Organization: Center for Biological Diversity Representative Quote: If the CRMP is going to extend commercial lease/permits for up to 20 years, then there should be conditions on these commercial operations to en sure they are compatible with the mission of the park. In no way should the CRMP make lease/permits within PRNS permanent. Lease/permits should au tomatically terminate upon their expiration, unless the NPS can demons trate that a specific individual lease/permit is an essential and positi ve addition to the natural resources of PRNS. Corr. ID: 938 Point Reyes National Seashore 31 Ranch CMP September 2014 Representative Quote: 3b. Buy-outs of leases/permits from willing leasees and permitees: If any lease/permit holders wants to voluntarily be bought-out of their lease/permit, they should be fa cilitated in this request by the NPS. National and state wildlife conservati on non-governmental organizations are also willing to help negotiate and help fund buy-outs of PRNS leases/permits from willing sellers. Tule Elk foundation Representative Quote: Tule Elk, including all native wildlife, should be the #1 consideration and long-term vision for the NPS. The pastoral lands for dairy cattle/grazing operations that have b een given special leases over the last nearly 50 years by the NPS should not take priority over native habitat and species within a National Park and specifically within the Pt Reyes National Seashore. The NPS should develop a phase out plan for dairy/grazing operations possibly in a maximum of 10 year lease agreements. It appears some of the ranches including the buildings/facilities are in poor condition with heavy grazing and very degraded lands on their leased land. Numerous cattle trails in the pastoral lands are creating erosion challenges throughout the park pastoral lands. There are little, if any, native forbs or shrubs in the heavily grazed lands. From our unders tanding, the original pastoral lands owners were given fair market value (acc ording to original statutes) for their lands and then allowed to continue to graze the lands under special agreements/leases with the federal government. Corr. ID: 1032 Representative Quote: A comprehensive ranch management plan should include allowing groups like the Nature Conservancy to buy the leases from willing sellers for the purpose of retu rning these lands to its former wild status. Additionally, businesses should be allowed to be bought out only for the same purpose. Which are: * Restoration of the coastal prairie native grasses. * Gradual removal of beef cattle fr om prairie lands to be restored. *All ranch lands that have been abandoned should be returned to wild lands and included in the Phillip Burton Wilderness or else a newly created California Coastal Prairie Wilderness. Corr. ID: 1038 Organization: the Wildlife Trust Representative Quote: Short term leases/permits revert to the NPS: At the expiration of the each current sh ort-term lease/permit, the land should revert to the NPS and these former co mmercial grazing lands should be restored to native coastal prairie and cost al scrub for the use of native wildlife, scientific study and passive recreation by the general public. Corr. ID: 3038 Representative Quote: Consider a phasing out period for family operated ranches to a competitive bid system open to all, which would avoid entitlement issues while still maintaining the historic agricultural landscape. Point Reyes National Seashore 32 Ranch CMP September 2014 Corr. ID: 3064 Organization: In Defense of Animals Representative Quote: General exceptions can be made when the NPS can demonstrate that a specific lease permit constitutes an essential and positive (enhancing) contribution to the natural resources of PRNS. This plan should also provide for an option where current lease permit holders voluntarily be bought out. To this end, the help of wildlife preservation organizations should be solicited to facilitate buy- outs from willing sellers. In addition, those lease permit holders interested in the future of the PRNS could be approached with an option of investing in turning an existing ranch building into a full-service hacienda -style lodge for visitors. Concern ID: 51727 CONCERN Commenters stated that the Ranch CMP should consider an alternative to STATEMENT: restore lands taken out of agriculture ba ck to agricultural use and offer long - term, self-renewing or \"rolling\" lease/permits to ranchers with consistent standards for practices that allow di versity of agricul tural activities. Representative Quote(s): Corr. ID: 2579 Representative Quote: A high priority for the fu ture is the restoration to active agricultural operation of the ranches whose leases have been terminated. Ranch leases should be lo ng term, 20-year leases and be self renewing, in order to allow continuity of the ranches into the future. All dairy ranches should be offered uniform st andards of permitted practices that allow for diversity of agric ultural activities on the ranches, to promote their economic viability. Corr. ID: 3076 Organization: Point Reyes Seashore Ranchers Association Representative Quote: Review of permit structure i) Historically and current ly, PRNS has issued SUPs to ranch operators for terms from five to twenty years. Th e November, 2012 memorandum from the Secretary of the Interior directed th e NPS to consider offering 20 year leases/permits to all ranchers. As PRNS has already offered 20 year agreements to some ranchers without a formal NEPA process, PRSRA believes PRNS could similarl y offer 20 year leases/p ermits to all ranchers without initiating the current EA. However, because PRNS included the review of permit structure as an issue to cover in this EA, PRSRA will provide some guidance for the process. This EA should fully evaluate the concept of a 20 year rolling renewal agreement. In th is type of agreement, at the end of each year the lease is automatically re newed for the length of the initial 20 year term, unless either the landowner or the farmer decides that the current term will be last term. In this way, the parties can continuously capture the benefits of a long term lease. The benefits include: (1) More commitment by the rancher to invest in infrastructure and repairs; (2) Improved public enjoyment of the seashore because ranches would more likely be maintained better; (3) More likely that banks will offer loans to the rancher; (4) More likely that ranchers wi ll invest in long term rangeland improvements; (5) More likely that ranchers will in vest in resource conservation projects; Point Reyes National Seashore 33 Ranch CMP September 2014 (6) More rancher eligibility for reso urce conservation project grants; (7) Reduced NPS staff time and paperwork; (8) Reduced rancher stress as permits near expiration; (9) Facilitated meeting of project objectives into the future; (10) Creation of more public trust th at NPS actually does support the long term conti nuation of ranching and farming in the project area; and (11) Increased security and incentive fo r the next generation ranchers within the project area to conti nue the family farming tradition. Concern ID: 51728 CONCERN Commenters made specific requests pertaining to their personal STATEMENT: lease/permits. One submitted an application for a new special use permit (SUP) while the other stated that they were reinstating their first right of refusal on grazing rights. Representative Quote(s): Corr. ID: 3063 Representative Quote: If a NEPA process was not initiated to remove our family and change the use of our ranch to an elk preserve, a NEPA process should not be necessary to return our fa mily to continue what appears to be what Congress intended. Given this fact, and that a NEPA process is underway that includes the future ma nagement of the D Ranch, I would ask that the reviewers include my request to return to the D Ranc h to carry on my family tradition. I have included my application (Attachment 3) to PRNS to obtain one of the new special use permits (SUP) to resume responsibility for the D Ranch, including the buildings and rangeland. Corr. ID: 3073 Representative Quote: I'm writing to request that Rancho Baulines be included in the Comprehensive Management Plan EA. As you know I leased Rancho Baulines for 33 years and ran cattle and horses. I took pride in the management of the old homestead and it's lands. I have no desire to lease the Ranch House again but would like to rein state my first right of refusal on the grazing rights. Concern ID: 51730 CONCERN Commenters would like the Ranch CMP to consider an alternative that STATEMENT: defines a process or guidelines for le ase/permit succession to ensure the future of ranching and farming at Po int Reyes National Seashore and in Marin County. Representative Quote(s): Corr. ID: 1038 Organization: The Wildlife Trust Representative Quote: Inheritance of PRNS lease/permits: The Ranch Management Plan must explicitly hold to the original intent of the PRNS founding principles: *Current and succeeding lease/permit ho lders must have a direct blood-line connection to the owner of the assigned ranch at the time of the founding of PRNS in the year 1962. * Lease/permit parcels must include a residence for the exclusive use of the Lease/permitee. Point Reyes National Seashore 34 Ranch CMP September 2014 * The lease/permitee must live in this re sidence on a full time basis, as their official residence. * Failure of any lease/permitee to comply with any of these conditions shall terminate the associated lease/permit. Corr. ID: 2988 Representative Quote: Succession - The Ranch CMP should make clear what the procedures are if a lessee/perm ittee dies or leaves the business. The plan should make an explicit commitme nt to keeping the current ranch lands in agriculture whenever possible, and the question is how to accomplish that. Here is the hierarchy of options that I suggest for the preferred alternative: - For over a century, the common pract ice has been for ranch ownership or leases to go to the children of a rancher if they want to continue ranching. The Seashore has given the first choice to immediate family members, and that practice should continue. - Before the Seashore existed, ranchers were much freer to make the fundamental business decisions about changing the scale of their operations by buying or selling ranch businesses an d, in the Shafter/Howard era, giving up or taking on a lease. Because the ranches in the Seashore are small in comparison to many in California, and because scale may be an important constraint to viability, second choice should go to neighboring ranches, another practice with precedent in th e Seashore. (However, in the case of dairies, there should be a priority given to keeping the ranch operating as a dairy if there is an existing dairy in the Seashore that wants to expand its operation.) - Using the same justification, if neighboring ranches do not exercise the option, third choice should go to other ranches in the Seashore. - If none of the above resu lts in an SUP, use some mechanism to put the land out for bid for agriculture, perhaps usin g something like the RFP process for farms at Cuyahoga Valley National Park. In this circumstance, it would be a positive outcome if some long-term workers on local ranches had the opportunity to acquire an SUP, much as the tenant forebears of the current ranchers had the opportunity to buy ranches from the Shafter and Howard estates. However, its not clear to me how the Seashore could do the social engineering that would give preference to a particular group as opposed to an RFP process open to anyone. For all four of the above, sub-letting should not be allowed. Corr. ID: 3025 Representative Quote: Maintaining 20 year leases is crucial especially for succession plans. The CMP should make clear what the procedures are if a lessee/permittee dies or leaves the business. The plan should make the commitment that current ranches are ke pt in agriculture whenever possible. To do this I suggest the following: \" First choice is given to immediate family member. Subletting should not be allowed. Family members take great pride in the businesses and land that they have cultivated and should at least have th e option to continue farming it after the named lessee has passed. \" Second choice should be to neighboring ranches which have precedent in Point Reyes National Seashore 35 Ranch CMP September 2014 the Seashore, subletting should not be allowed. \" Third choice should be to other ranches/ranchers in the Seashore. Again, subletting should not be allowed. \" Fourth choice should be, if in a position to do so, leasing to an employee of the ranch. Concern ID: 51731 CONCERN Commenters would like the Ranch CMP to consider an alternative with lease STATEMENT: regulations modeled on the Cuyahoga Valley National Park's \"Countryside Initiative.\" Representative Quote(s): Corr. ID: 2775 Representative Quote: New long term leasing regulations could be modeled on the Cuyahoga Valley National Park 's \"Countryside In itiative.\" Lessees would be supported in the continued adoption of ecologically sustainable farming practices, including organic and carbon-benficial practices. In order to encourage a sustainable combination of agricultural land uses, a diversity of food and fiber crops would be possible, in addition to dairy and beef operations and value added products and processing. Corr. ID: 2960 Organization: Marin Conservation League Representative Quote: Consider using long-term leasing regulations that could be modeled on the Cuyahoga Valley National Park's Countryside Initiative. With Cuyahoga as precedent, the park could lease the land directly to ranchers and enter into an agreement for day-to-day management by a nonprofit partner whose bo ard could include farm advisors and other Marin ranchers, who are peers within the local ranching community. In the Cuyahoga example, the nonprofit partner \"provides technical information and guidance on sustainable agriculture, he lps prioritize rehabilitation of farm properties, recruits and evaluates pros pective farm lessees, and will evaluate and monitor each farm's annual operation plan\" Corr. ID: 3074 Organization: Sonoma State University Representative Quote: PRNS could easily follow the model of Cuyahoga Valley National Park (CVNP), with its Countryside Initiative bringing agricultural use back to parts of that park after decades of absence. Starting in 1999, CVNP has worked with a non-profit cooperating partner, the Countryside Conservancy, to rees tablish working agriculture via rehabilitating historic farms and farmland and offering long-term leases, up to sixty years in length, via a competitive proposal process as a way of resurrecting and maintaining the rural char acter of the valley. In its 2011 RFP seeking new proposals from leasees, CVNP even referenced the importance of parks as lived-in places: Farming in a national park (or any other park) is a most unconventional idea in America. Americans tend to perceive parks as places to visit, not live in- regardless of whether it is a Yellowst one-like wilderness, or a manicured metropark. That is not the case in many other parts of the world. In Great Britain, for example, over 10% of the English landscape is located within the Point Reyes National Seashore 36 Ranch CMP September 2014 boundaries of a national park-over 90% of that is privately owned, and most of it is in farms. In Great Britain, farming in the boundaries of national parks is considered the only practical way to maintain the openness, beauty, and diversity of the countryside. Concern ID: 51734 CONCERN Commenters stated that, during the d evelopment of alternatives, the Ranch STATEMENT: CMP should consider establishing a set of transparent rules/regulations, goals, and actions that are applied consistently across all lease/permits, including: providing a consistent evaluation tool; enforcing accountability for non-compliance of rules/regulations; pu blically releasing residual dry matter (RDM) on an annual basis; ensuring tr ansparency of information of discounts offered to lease/permit holders along with rationale for offering discounts; providing incentives to ranchers th e provide environmental services not required by lease/permit; and reevaluating of stocking rates. Commenters also suggested development of a mechanism to monitor and repair fences. One commenter stated that, during the d evelopment of alternatives, the Ranch CMP should reassess the criteria for AUM allowed in lease/permits. Representative Quote(s): Corr. ID: 3032 Organization: California Cattlem en's Association Representative Quote: Additionally, it is important that the permits and permittees on PRNS be treated unifor mly and fairly. As mentioned in the letter presented by the PRSRA to NP S for this public scoping comment period, it appears that there are a number of areas where certain management guidelines are not applied to some ranchers, or where management practices are not uniformly enforced (e.g., range management practices, maximum stocking rates/densities, etc.). It is important that NPS be consistent in its treatment of permits and permittees, to avoid putting certain ranchers at a competitive disadvantage. Though we acknowledge that every ranch is unique and that permit conditions will likely reflect this reality, it is important that these permits be treated as consistently as practicable. Corr. ID: 1140 Organization: Environmental Action Committee of West Marin Representative Quote: Public Documents and Public Process: Will the 20- year leases become public documents? Public oversight of the Sea shore ranch provisions will help ensure the go als of the Ranch Plan are met. Corr. ID: 2998 Organization: Save Our Seashore Representative Quote: 1.Reassess AUM criteria in light of breeding techniques that increased livestock weights 2.To assure consistency, AUM criteria should be in one PRNS-wide document, not in individual SUPs Corr. ID: 3022 Organization: University of California Cooperative Extension Representative Quote: Clarify NPS expectations and rancher commitments to ensure consistency of agricultural lease/permits and review and update permit structure to reflect decisions made through this plan. Consistency between SUPs for the various ranches is important so that each ranching Point Reyes National Seashore 37 Ranch CMP September 2014 family has an equitable opportunity for operating a sustainable livestock operation and for diversification. We also encourage you to re-evaluate stocking rates so that they consistent ly reflect the carrying capacity of each ranch, and allow flexibility in stocking for the benefit of different types of ranching operations and natural reso urce management. Current stocking rate/density limitations between ranc hes are arbitrary. Information on calculating stocking rates can be found at: http://www.carangeland.org/images/GrazingH Establish a set of transparent rules/regulations, goals and actions that are applied consiste ntly across lease-based operations. Provide a consistent mechanism for evaluating, modifying and enforcing these rules/regulations, goals and actions - including accountability for what happens when they are not met both on the part of NPS and the leasee (e.g. if an NPS goal is to evaluate RDM on an a nnual basis, NPS must report publicly via website that it failed to evaluate RDM during a given year). Provide transparency, consistency and itemization of discounts given to leasees and a detailed basis for charges to each leasee (e.g. riparian exclusion fence maintenance -$100.00; 70 elk grazing at 0.40 AUM $-196.00). Provide incentives to leasees for compliance and efforts to go above and beyond meeting NPS resource goals (e.g. ripa rian fence maintenance discount). Discounts should be for circumstances not encountered on off-park ranches. Corr. ID: 3055 Representative Quote: The park's legal capacities as landlord: The new leases need to provide the NPS the capaci ty to effectively manage its tenants. Specifically (and in consideration of some recent behavior by tenants) the leases need to provide redress for illegal (and particularly criminal) behaviors as well as unpermitted activities that are harmful to the Park. Recognize over- reach and chronic non-compliance by certain ag producers. Serial non- compliant leaseholders and those operating standards run counter to Park values and purpose should not automatically be given renewals when leases expire. Concern ID: 51735 CONCERN Commenters stated that a range of lease/ permit prices, terms and fees should STATEMENT: be considered based on various factors, including: fair market value, income of ranchers, commodity prices, financial viability of a ranch operation, number of cattle, and grazing area. One commenter indicated that the Ranch CMP should consider an alternative th at reduces lease prices for ranchers that are adversely affected by tule elk. Another commenter made several suggestions relating to lease/permits, including: conducting appraisals for AUM FMV annually with comparisons of discounts; having perm its based on FMV, which include differences in ranche s; ensuring that homes are based on Point Reyes National Seashore 38 Ranch CMP September 2014 FMV; assessing ranch insurance as it relates to FMV; assessing the possessory tax as it relates to FMV; accruing cost recovery amount (CRA)-FMV after FMV charges with the difference goin g to the agriculture subsidy; and calculating the annual CRA needed to fund agriculture monitoring and mitigation. One commenter suggested that the Ranch CMP consider an alternative that streamlines the lease process. Representative Quote(s): Corr. ID: 1026 Representative Quote: - Streamline the lease process Corr. ID: 1027 Representative Quote: LEASES It does not make any difference in the le ngth of the ranch lease terms, if the leasee cannot produce enough income to pay for the lease. Each time a new appraisal is done the rent is increased. There should be some consideration of the amount of income the la can produce. When will the cap on rent increases come into play-when 100 % of the lands production is taken? There has to be a better way of determining lease/rent terms-perhaps a percentage of gross income or a similar factor. If the leasee cannot have the ability to make a product of his choosing, and if the elk are not removed, and if we cannot enhance pasture lands, the lease is not important. Corr. ID: 2270 Representative Quote: As recently reported by the Los Angeles Times \"The park service charges ranchers a grazing fee of just $7 a month for a cow and a calf. That fee on private land in neig hboring communities ranges from $16 to $25. The homesteads where some ranch families li ve are leased to them by the park at less than market rates\". Ranchers have been profiting from low leasing fees for too long. They should pay the fair market fee or move out fr om the park, which would be the best outcome if this generation wishes to see the recovery of our precious land. Park authorities should take into accou nt the interests of the general public, not those of a selected minority with a high sense of immunity. Corr.

Secretary Salazar's statement several months ago that th e ranchers should be given 20-year permits was made without NEPA compliance and thus should not be treated as legally binding.

Representative Quote(s): Corr. ID: 1022 Organization: In Defense of Animals Representative Quote: The NPS controls which area can be used for private ranching leases. Thus, the NPS should adjust boundaries to better manage natural resources by including those ar eas where elk currently do not occupy and by excluding areas for ranching that tule elk currently prefer. For example, tule elk currently favor ha bitat around the defunct D Ranch. Consequently, lease permit s should be imme diately reverted to the NPS and the area be converted to wildlife habitat. Corr. ID: 1038 Organization: the Wildlife Trust Representative Quote: Adjustment of lease boundaries for Co-existence, if leases/permits are allowed: Basically, the free-ranging tule elk at Pt. Reyes Nat. Seashore are telling us humans wh ere they want to spend most of their time. The research and mapping done by David Press and colleagues greatly helps us to understand the whereabouts of the preferred tule elk locations within PRNS. The U.S federal government owns every acre of PRNS and these acres are under the supervision of the National Park Service including all the lands under any kind of a lease/permit. Theref ore, since the National Park Service controls what specific acres in PRNS will be put out for a private grazing lease/permit, the National Park Service can and should adjust these boundaries to better manage th e natural resources of PRNS. Currently, since the leases/p ermits expire every year or in the short-term, the Point Reyes National Seashore 41 Ranch CMP September 2014 new Ranch Management Plan should re -draw certain lease boundaries to include different coastal prairie land fo r the leases/permitees in the two main areas where the tule elk are not gene rally congregating. For Example, the current boundaries and lease/permits fo r the Drake's Beach region includes an area highly prized by tule elk. This favorite tule elk habitat is based around the defunct D Ranch and as a result, cattle leases/permits for this area should revert back to the NPS as wildlife habi tat. The same type of lease boundary adjustment should be made in the po pular tule elk area near the \"Home Ranch\", where cattle lease/permit boun daries can be adjusted to nearby grazing land that are little used by tule-elk. These preventative boundary changes will greatly help to keep tule elk and cattle from being on top of each other. The number of acres under lease/permit and the forage quality can remain the same as under the original lease/permit boundaries for each of th e vested historic ra nch families. Costs for making these boundary re-adjustments can be funded by the NPS which will quickly be recovered because of less damage repair expenses, no costly hazing operations and other headaches now involving the NPS and its overworked personnel.

Free roaming Tule Elk cannot be harassed, chased, herded, moved or killed in the pastoral lands including any lands with sustainable dairy/grazing leases. The leases must manage their lands in accordance with guidelines provided that incorporate practices to eliminate any negative impacts on the native Tule Elk within the pastoral lands. The leases should be short-term, maybe in 10 increments so that the NPS with public input can reassess the impacts of the dairy/cattle operations on the free-roaming native Tule Elk herds th roughout the pastoral lands. Corr.

ID: 3076 Organization: Point Reyes Seashore Ranchers Association Representative Quote: (b) Range management practices known to be effective for improving forage qualit y and quantity should be allowed for all ranchers and farmers in the project area. For centurie s, these coastal prairie grasslands have been carefully managed by humans interest ed in preserving the productivity of these rangelands. Careful management using tools including fire, mowing, grazing and planting rangeland forages have resulted in preserving the lush, productive and bio-diverse grasslands Congress meant to protect. PRNS contains perfect examples of how vital this rancher stewardship is. Where the NPS has allowed ranchers and farmers in th e project area to do their jobs, using the above tools, the resource has been protected and is largely unchanged since the Shafter era and when Congress reco gnized the good stewardship of the Point Reyes ranchers. In essentially every place where NPS decided to end livestock grazing and evict the ranch fa milies, the land stewardship ended. These locations without the ranchers ra ngeland management have lost their historic grassland character. With the loss of livestock grazing, a change in both plant and animal species assemblages occurred. Where the NPS has chosen to end ranching and the rangeland stewardship provided by the ranchers, the ungulate carrying capacity has largely decr eased. The loss of forage due to the lack of land stewardship and lack of range management in these former ranch lands have now contributed to the tule elk crisis. Invasive brush and weeds have invaded these areas to a point that seashore visitors have largely lost access. PRSRA does not believe that the objective of Congress was to allow these fantastic, sweeping, well managed, accessible grasslands to be lost. PRNS allows Point Reyes National Seashore 45 Ranch CMP September 2014 some ranchers to use appropriate rang e management tools and is prohibiting others from using these scientifically proven tools. PRSRA suggests that PRNS treat ranchers and farmers equally and allow every rancher or farmer in the project area to do their jobs, preserving these precious landscapes using the best available range management tools - responsible tools used by land managers everywhere.

EACs reading of that legislation is that it provided for ongoing dairies and cattle ranch operations. Under what authority could the Seashore justify allowing anything greater than a small area, perhaps 1-2 acres per historic farm, of diversified agricultural use. Corr. ID: 3076 Organization: Point Reyes Seashore Ranchers Association Representative Quote: On farm borrow sites should be allowed for PRNS rancher rock needs. Historically, seashore ranchers utilized small on-farm rock resources for road maintenance and armoring high traffic livestock areas including gateways, water troughs and holding pens. The native Mont erey shale present on some ranches is softer and less angular than typical purchased crushed rock, making it the perfect choice for livestock. A few years ago, PRNS closed these important local resources. This has caused ranchers to spend significant amounts of money to purchase rock and have the rock trucked long distances. The purchased rock is generally hard, crushed rock with angles and sharp points risking injury to livestock hooves. PRSRA suggests that the EA consider allowing seashore ranchers to resume the historic use of at least one, two or three of the many sites that have recently been disallowed by PRNS. This NEPA process should consider the benefits of using on-farm resources in lieu of long distance trucking. PRSRA is willing to assure PRNS that the required reclamation plan is in place with the California Department of Conservation. This will give the guarantee to PRNS and the public that the small quarries will eventually be properly reclaimed with soil cover an d appropriate vegetation. PRSRA suggests that the rock can be used only within th e project area and could not be sold for any other purpose. This is an opportunity for PRNS to collaborate with the seashore ranchers to improve ranch conditions and profitability while furthering the PRNS stated plan object ives. Restoring this historic activity would result in: 1. Improved ranch road maintenance resulting in less erosion and resource damage; 2. Reduced large truck traffic on the narrow PRNS roads; 3. Gateway communities appreciation of the elimination that the new rock truck traffic has caused by the ranch resource closure; 4. Increased visitor enjoyment by limiting truck traffic; 5.

Ranching may have pl ayed a historical role, but Tule Elk were the original grazing herds and should be allowed to expand into currently restricted areas. Ranching sh ould be limited in order that grazing lands currently off limits to the publ ic and Tule Elk may revert to a more natural state.

However , it must be understood that the real historic grazers in this area and over much of the rest of California are tule elk, along with deer and pronghorn antelo pe. For at least 10,000 years, even before the Coast Miwok arrived, tule elk have grazed the grasslands of California, including the coastal prairies and brush-fields of what has become Pt. Reyes National Seashore thousands of years later. This historic grazing by tule elk has been constant except for the relatively short period in the 1800s and 1900s, when market hunters and ranc hers eliminated th em from the most of California, including along the Coast.

Tule Elk Foundation (TEF) Response: We believe that the Pt Reyes National Seashore should adhere to its publis hed statement cited from the Pt Reyes National Seashore Website: \"Further conservation efforts (of Tule Elk) resulted in an additional free-ranging herd being established at Point Reyes. In 1998, 28 animals taken from the Tomale s Point preserve were released in the wilderness area south of Limantour Beac h. Reintroduction of Tule elk to the National Seashore and the further esta blishment of the free-ranging herd has been an important component of the restoration of the natural systems historically found in this unique and treasured place.\" (bttp://www.nps.gov/pore/naturescience/tule elk.htm) Based on the National Park mission an d your documented efforts to restore free-roaming Tule Elk in the Point Reye s National Seashore (PRNS), the TEF recommends that the #1 priority in PR NS needs to remain the preservation and restoration of native, free-roaming Tu le Elk (and other wildlife) including the pastoral lands. The continuing re storation of the Tule Elk, a native endemic herbivore, will further the mi ssion of restoring the native landscape including native perennial bunchgrasses and other native plants that co- evolved with Tule Elk. Tule Elk, as an umbrella species, will be integral in the long-term restoration of the native landscape. Its presence will also benefit the restoration of other native animal spec ies which have been degraded and/or lost in these historic sites as a resu lt of grazing/browsing by non-native European cattle and the eventual establ ishment of many exotics throughout this park.

Furthermore, new information about the efficacy of contraceptive approaches on cervid populations is available (Patton et al. 2007, Rutberg an d Naugle 2008, Rutberg et. al 2013). The effects of the vaccine are reversible after three years of treatment, and no adverse health effects have been appa rent among treated animals or among young they carried at the time of treatment. Corr. ID: 2936 Organization: The Humane Society of the United States Representative Quote: If some form of population control is undertaken, work at Point Reyes with the immunocontraception vaccine porcine zona pellucida (PZP) has shown that reproductive control is a viable option and could be implemented (Shideler et al. 20 02). Past and recent field studies have now shown that management of cervid populations with PZP can be achieved (Rutberg et al. 2013, Naugle et al. 2002 , Rutberg and Naugle 2008). Fire Island, including the National Seashore of the same name, is a 22.5 km2 island in New York. Native white-tailed deer are foun d in abundance on the island and a hunt to control population size was st opped by public outcry and a lawsuit (Rutberg and Naugle 2008). A program of immunocontraception with PZP was initiated. Deer were not marked or tagged and all vaccines were delivered remotely using darts (Rutberg and Naug le 2008). The darts contained a dye to mark the deer to help avoid retreatment. In the most closely monitored portion of the island, the deer population decreased 10-11% p year during the program. These population studies were conducted by an independent entity, the Biological Resources Division of the U. S. Geological Survey, of the U.S. Department of the Interior. Similar population declines were obtained in smaller areas where white-tailed deer we re treated with PZP (Rutberg et al. 2004). Corr. ID: 2936 Organization: The Humane Society of the United States Representative Quote: A study and several ongoing research projects have demonstrated that surgical sterilization is a feasible and potentially efficient way to manage cervid populations. For example, from 2002-2005, the city of Highland Park, Illinois, conducted a trap -sterilize - release program on the citys deer (Matthews 2005). In that stud y, does were sterilized through tubal ligation so they were not susceptible to the behavioral alterations typical of methodologies that halt hormone production. This methodology was both safe and humane and resulted in very low mortality rates due to surgery. Computer models of surgical steriliz ation from this and other research revealed that areas can maintain their deer populations at target densities by sterilizing 32 percent of the does per year (Porter 2004). Also, recently, two surgical sterilization projects were conducted in two different communities in the U.S. In December 2012, the village of Cayuga Heights, New York, hired a contractor to capture, surgically sterilize via ovariectomies, and release 137 does - more than 90 percent of the villages deer population (Anon 2013a). In January 2013, the same contractor began a surgical sterilization project on a herd of approximately 170 deer living in a retirement community near San Jose kn own as the Villages (Anon 2013b) and the same contractor is currently conducting sterilization operations in Fairfax Point Reyes National Seashore 61 Ranch CMP September 2014 City, Virginia and Baltimore County, Maryland. Based upon these findings, surgical sterilization may be a viable op tion for tule elk management at Point Reyes. Corr. ID: 2936 Organization: The Humane Society of the United States Representative Quote: It should also be noted that while PZP and other reproductive control agents and procedur es have been shown to effectively reduce fertility, lethal control may so metimes have the oppos ite effect. It has been shown that the reproductive rate of cervids is greatly reduced at high population densities while cervids in areas subjected to periodic lethal removal have enhanced fertility rates resu lting in increased population growth to compensate for harvested animals (S wihart et al. 1998). Further research also indicates that lethal removal of both sexes does nothing to stop fluctuations in cervid populations du e to forage competition and natural mortality as a result of severe winter weather (Patterson and Power 2002). Contraception is superior to lethal control in that it leaves animals in a population as placeholders that are repr oductively dead ends yet continue to occupy consistent home ranges and ex hibit natural herding behaviors. The presence of these adult placeholders ensures continuity in the social framework of the herd while limiting the number of young and more mobile animals that might pose increased risks of dispersal to ranches. Based upon available research, NPS must seriously evaluate the usefulness of fertility control to stabilize and reduce the tule elk population density at Point Reyes if population reduction becomes necessary. It behooves the NPS to closely examine these options especially in light of the social and political controversy that surrounds lethal management. Corr. ID: 3064 Organization: In Defense of Animals Representative Quote: There is no need for \"relo cation\" or any other type of \"removal\" of tule elk, nor should any hazing operations\" occur to push tule elk from \"ranch lands.\" Should the need arise to reduce the tule elk population at some point, no lethal methods may be employed. Instead, cost- efficient and effective immunocontrace ption should be implemented as was done successfully between 1998 and 2000, when the project was headed up by the late Susan Shideler with UC-Davis. During those three years, success rates in reducing elk reproduction was 96% in the first year, 84% in the second, and 91% in the third year. The results of th is trial were published in a highly respected scientific journal. (Shidele r et al. 2002. Use of porcine zona highly successful PZP project is the management of bison on Catalina Island, CA. Immunocontraception is a cost-effective, humane, and efficient management method. Concern ID: 51855 CONCERN Commenters provided a variety of reason s as to why conflicts between the elk Point Reyes National Seashore 62 Ranch CMP September 2014 STATEMENT: and ranching activities need to be mana ged, including: challenges in meeting organic certification requirements, decrea sed availability of natural resources, interaction issues between cattle and elk, transmission of disease, damage to ranch infrastructure, competition for forage, compounding impacts due to drought conditions (which justifies imme diate action), and impacts to cultural resources. Commenters would like assessments of these impacts to be included in the Ranch CMP. Several management methods for elk were suggested, includ ing: relocation out of the pastoral zone, management of wilderness habitat, building and/or reinforcing fencing between the pa storal zone and the wilderness, compensating ranchers for elk damage and losses of forage, sterilization, hunting and distribution of meat, euthan izing of diseased elk, use of natural controls (starvation, disease, predation, etc.), reintroduction of predators, use of supplemental water resources to lure the elk, hazing, use of lease money to employ elk wranglers, increased staff for elk management, and reduction of herd size.

In the long term, especially if wolves become a threatened species in California (which could well happen within 20 years due to breeding in Oregon), PORE would be an excellent place for a reintroduction plan. Ranchers could be compensated for any cattle losses which might occur. This IS a reasonably forseeable action, based on the Point Reyes National Seashore 63 Ranch CMP September 2014 success of other such reintroductions. Corr. ID: 2936 Representative Quote: Tule elk are an important part of the ecosystems they occupied before extirpation by humans , and upon return they have entered into highly dynamic interactions wi th ecosystem components and ranch operations. The Ranch CMP/EA should evaluate the potential effect of natural disease as a population control mechanism and predation as a factor influencing survivorship before determining the need for steps to control population numbers. Corr. ID: 2988 Representative Quote: Tule elk - The Ranch RMP should be explicit that the tule elk need management, including this reasoning: elk numbers on ranch lands can be expected to increase without management; if elk numbers increase, the elk will reach the level of unacceptable impact (and may have already) on the Seashores largest cultur al resource and will likely result in impairment of that resource in th e absence of management. Under NPS Management Policies 2006, unacceptable impacts are to be avoided and impairment is prohibited (see sections 1.4.1 through 1.4.7.2 http://www.nps.gov/policy/ mp2006.pdf ). The plan should specify any examples of where elk and agriculture co-exist successfully and explain what factors are responsible for that success (e.g., hunting, reimbursement for damages, etc). Given the realities of limited resources of the Seashore now and in the foreseeable future, it should be a high priority that the preferred alternative require as small a demand for ongoing management as possible. (The Seashores long and problematic hi story with intermittent culling of fallow and axis deer is instructive in this regard.) Corr. ID: 3003 Organization: WildCare Representative Quote: WildCare recommends that NPS continue to explore the provision of supplemental water intended to draw elk away from the ranches. In comparison to any proposed population management plan, non - lethal or otherwise, we also urge NPS to include a cost-benefit analysis of repairing and reinforcing fencing on the affected ranches. Appropriate fencing would prohibit Tule Elk from accessing the available food and water on the leased properties. Repair of fences would most likely be less expensive and is much less invasive than lethal control and we are prepared to ask our 20,000 stakeholders to weigh in on this issue if necessary. Corr.

Such a fence would presumably ru n north-south from Limantour Estero to somewhere near Ottinger's Hill. Both ends would be problematic; neither could effectively contain the elk. The southern end would have to extend way out into the Estero- - -a fully designated Wilderness area that plainly forbids such constructs- - -and would still probably not keep determined elk from simply swimming or wading around. The northern end is equally problematic. There is no natural or engineered barrier to keep th e elk from simply walking around the end of the fence. Concern ID: 51857 CONCERN Commenters indicated that a long-term elk management approach is needed STATEMENT: immediately and should involve implemen tation of the 1998 Elk Management Plan, which the park has the author ity to implement, to ensure the continuation of agriculture in the park. This plan does not authorize the movement of elk beyond the designat ed elk range. Further, commenters noted that all necessary analysis was completed for the 1998 management plan, and management, including compensation to ranchers for damages, should begin immediately. Representative Quote(s): Corr.

This is imperative for the survival of agriculture at PRNS and must include sustaining agriculture throughout the Pastoral Zo ne and removal of all tule elk from the Pastoral Zone. Evaluate management approaches that improve maintenance of ranch operations and protect native wildlife and vegetation populations; identify collaborative management opportunities that promote protection of sensitive and rare cultural and natural resources through adaptation of ranch and PRNS management activities; This laudable objective must engage both agriculture and PRNS in in-depth exploration of the possibilities for collaboration through a creative, adaptive ecological and agroecologial approach to resource management both within and beyond the Pastoral Zone. Corr.

We encourage NPS to take acti on to do so immediately. If NPS nevertheless defers action on tule elk in the pastoral zone until after the new CMP/EA is completed, we urge that this be made a top priority of the CMP/EA. The destruction tule elk have caused on PRNS ranches is devastating and well-documented. In particular, the el k regularly compete with cattle for forage, and have been known to damage fences and other ranch property during such incursions. The Limantour elk make daily incursions upon the Home Ranch and graze grasslands which are leased by NPS for cattle grazing. Likewise, the lessees of C Ranch have seen repeated loss of pasture as a result of elk living on what used to be the D Ranch. As tule elk require 10-15 pounds of forage a day, such incursions represent a significant strain on the resources required by these ranchers. Corr. ID: 3063 Representative Quote: I am also aware that the 1998 tule elk management plan authorized PRNS to transfer the elk from Tomales Point to the designated elk range in the Limant our wilderness, not the D Ranch or anywhere else in the pastoral zone. Th e plan says that the elk may free range within the designated elk range. It does not authorize the movement of elk beyond the designated elk range. I am aware of growing public opinion that the elk should be removed from the pastoral zone and returned to the designated elk range so that elk don' t continue to ruin my neighbors' businesses. I agree and expect that to be the outcome of this process. Concern ID: 51858 CONCERN Commenters indicated that management of th e tule elk is needed as a result of STATEMENT: issues pertaining to Johne's disease. One commenter suggested that the NPS assess the presence and transmission cap acity of Johne's disease in wildlife and livestock, and stated that relocation of elk is not an option within the park due to the presence of disease. Therefor e, elk must be harvested or moved to sufficiently remote locations to avoid spread of disease. Another commenter requested that the plan describe the history of Johne's disease in the park, how it is tested for, and how it is managed. Representative Quote(s): Corr.

The Park Service should discuss the extent to which this disease occurs in the park, the cause or causes of it, including whether it existed in the park before the introduction of elk, and Point Reyes National Seashore 67 Ranch CMP September 2014 how the Park Service intends to reduce and, ultimately, eliminate it to the extent feasible. Corr. ID: 1490 Representative Quote: Game Farms for elk are hopefully coming to an end in Montana. If you want problems with diseases like CWD...Chronic Wasting Disease, that's where you will find it. Elk, like any other wild animal, is not meant to be held captive. By their nomadic ways, they avoid predators, over grazing, and disease. If they have brucolosis, it is because it was GIVEN to them by coming in contact with cattle. Corr. ID: 2775 Representative Quote: The activities listed in this section underscore PRNS failure to recognize the tule elk crisis as a crisis, and the ineffectiveness of NPS response to that crisis. Monitoring an unfolding disaster, repeated repair of damaged fences, ongoing ineffective ha zing of elk, and planned future epidemiological studies do not consti tute management and certainly not effective management in the context of the real and existing threat to current and historical land uses at Point Reyes. The single greatest cause of mortality of elk at PRNS is malnutrition. This is hardly a glowing testament to the quality of either elk management, or ecosystem management, at PRNS. The PRNS elk herd was known to carry Johnes disease at the time these animals were released from their Pi erce Point enclosure; elk were released despite the explicit recommendation that elk not be released where contact with livestock could occur (Cook et al 1997). Furthe r epidemiological study is warranted, but is not needed to justify removal of elk from the Pastoral Zone, where their continued presence effectively consti tutes biological warfare against the PRNS ranching community and the ecological integrity of the Pastoral Zone. If, as California Department of Fish and Wildlife has said, relocation of adult elk within PRNS is not a viable option, these animals must be harvested for regional foodbanks or relocated to a site sufficiently remote from PRNS to preclude their self-volitional return. Corr. ID: 2986 Organization: Marin Humane Society Representative Quote: Disease and morbidity rates of the Tule Elk should be examined by a scientific panel of expe rts. The health and well-being of this herd should be a high priority, especially since Marin County residents and visitors to the Park are sensitive to animal issues. Additionally, livestock shouldn't fall victim to diseases spread by the elk and likewise the elk should be protected from the livestock residing in the Seashore. Concern ID: 51859 CONCERN Several commenters advocated for lethal management such as hunting to be STATEMENT: used as a means to control the elk population in the pastoral zone. Specific suggestions included: hunt only elk that are causing damage, conduct limited hunts with ranchers selling tags and putting profits toward infrastructure repair or habitat restoration, sell meat as a local food source, and donate meat Point Reyes National Seashore 68 Ranch CMP September 2014 to soup kitchens. Representative Quote(s): Corr. ID: 10 Representative Quote: For those animals that have escaped and are truly causing provable damage, they could be hunted in a controlled hunt. For those animals that are not causing damage such as the Limantour herd, leave them alone Corr. ID: 32 Representative Quote: Consider hunting the elk. Ranchers could sell a bull elk tag for at least 5000.00/a piece. 10 Elk = minimum of 50,000 -. This mo ney could be put to a habitat restoration/wilderness project. Corr.

Corr. ID: 3031 Representative Quote: It seems a little impossible to have an unmanaged elk herd on a managed landscape. The park needs to bridge the gap between the needs of wildlife and viable ranching and the solution is really not that difficult. In the absence of natural predators, any deer or elk population needs hunters to keep the population in chec k. Without hunting, the elk population will grow indefinitely until it has saturated the habitat. Introducing limited hunting now, while the elk population is still small, would give the park a chance to maintain wild elk and provid e the ranchers a way for the elk to be beneficial without the herd becoming so huge that it overtakes the pastures. Allow ranchers to either sell hunting ta gs, and thereby generate thousands of dollars of income to offset damage the elk may be causing to their infrastructure, or periodically shoot one themselves for food and two things are accomplished. One: the elk become a positive or at least less of a negative, and two: hunted populations move more. Shoot an elk once in a while and they aren't going to spend as much time in one location any more. Do not readily discount hunting elk as an option. There are other parks and preserves in the NPS that allow hunting. This is just a matter of regulation. It may not be in your management guidelines now, but you can write it in. Ask your lawyers. I'm sure they can write up the language for you. Safety doesn't have to be an issue. Spec ific areas at specific times could be outlined for the hunts. Again, other parks manage to do it. Point Reyes National Seashore 69 Ranch CMP September 2014 Concern ID: 51860 CONCERN One commenter indicated that long-ter m hunting of elk should not be a STATEMENT: management option because the park would be committing to management activities that may not be reflective of the elk population at a given point in time.

The HSUS maintains that lethal control is neither a socially acceptable pr actice nor, in the long-term, the most ecologically sound approach to resolving conflicts with wild animals such as elk. Instead, we endorse the strategic use of fencing, exclosures, and hazing to immediately reduce damage attributed to elk to acceptable levels and, if it becomes necessary to gradually reduce and stabilize the elk population, using reproductive controls. Corr. ID: 2936 Organization: The Humane Society of the United States Representative Quote: Give attention to humaneness, its relevance to the public, and the consequences of actions for the welfare of wild animals in the Point Reyes National Seashore 70 Ranch CMP September 2014 Ranch CMP/EA beyond merely considering the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) guidelines for euthanasia. Beyond the discussion of humaneness in euthanasia techniques lies a broader issue regarding the ethical and moral basis of management actions themselves. The concept of unnecessary death is a relevant and significant issue any time lethal control of wild animals is proposed. Ethical concerns regarding how we treat wild animals, and why we do so, should be addressed and recognized as a first order concern. Killing should be avoided unless compelli ng justification (immediate threat to human health and safety, for example, if such action has been shown to reduce the threat) for actions exists. Fu rthermore, lethal control of animals without action to prevent recurrenc e of problems is unacceptably shortsighted and inappropriate. Time and economic concerns are irrelevant in a discussion of humaneness, u nnecessary death, and other welfare consequences. An action is not more or less necessary or humane because it is more or less time-consuming, more or less technically feasible, and/or more or less costly. If after such a full ex amination of the issues, NPS decides to implement a less humane but less time-c onsuming, easier, and/or less costly alternative, it must clearly characteriz e that choice for the public and the decision maker. The NPS must acknowl edge the concepts of humaneness and ethical issues including unnecessary death, as a significant part of the publics interest in NPS management of Point Reyes. Corr.

In order to protect the Park's natural and historical resources, the elk herd must be managed. Lack of management is curre ntly putting the Park's resources at risk. Management strategies such as cu lling the herd and/or controlling the location of herd with fencing are imperative. The elk herd should be managed within the carrying capacity of the \"w ilderness lands\", yet the Park Service seems unwilling or unable to address th is issue. I would encourage the Park Service to look at other park systems that manage mega fauna for assistance on process and method.

The Park has a moral and a legal obligation to be good landlords to these hardworking suppliers of good local food that we need for sustainability Indeed, the whole problem could have been avoided if the Park had not installed a second herd at Limantou r. It is surprising that the Park did not anticipate their subsequent migration onto pastureland, and disturbing that they have done so little to mitigate th at situation. Assertions that little can be done because it is not considered in the current management plan do not ring true to the ranchers or the public, so it is widely believed that the elk are a being used as a lever to force ranchers out of the Park. Public perception and the livelihood of the ranchers can both be rescued by immediately removing the intruding elk back to Tomales Poin t. Being that unforeseen situations often do come up and that this one can be mitigated so expediently without any damage to the elk, it would be ea sy for the Park to argue for immediate action regardless of the degree to which this situation is or isn't dealt with in the current management plan.

A quickly designed and implemented plan to move Elk back to Wilderness Zone is a priority of ranchers. There are approximately 70 Tu le Elk that have migrated into the Pastoral Zone disrupting several ranching operations.

ID: 2718 Organization: UC Cooperative Extension Representative Quote: Essential to the success of this planning process is reducing conflicts between the reintrodu ced elk herds and the parks historic ranches and dairies. The lack of management of the introduced elk herd has resulted in an over population of the species, decreased natural resources and critical impacts to both livestock and dairy producers. The growing numbers of unmanaged elk have taken up permanent residence on working ranches and dairies in the pastoral zone. They harass cattle and have the potential to spread cattle-borne diseases. They also damage fences and equipment, and Point Reyes National Seashore 75 Ranch CMP September 2014 compete with cows for carefully managed organic forage on ranch lands. This is a serious problem for ranches now and will certainly lead to impairment of historic values of the working ranches. Tule elk ranging freely in the national seashores pastoral zone now pose an im minent threat to the viability of the very dairy ranches that the pastoral zone was created to protect. The NPS needs to implement strategies to ensure permanent, effective separation of the elk from the working ranches pastoral zone.

BMPs have recently languished at PRNS during an approval process instead of being quickly authorized. One of the stumbling blocks is the unnecessary requirement imposed by PRNS to repeat a NEPA analysis that had already been accomplished by another federa l agency. There is only one NEPA.

Concern ID: 51892 CONCERN Commenters suggested that connectiv ity and accessibility should be STATEMENT: improved within the park. Many commenters suggested specific areas where trails should be improved or developed within agricultural areas of the park. Representative Quote(s): Corr. ID: 9 Point Reyes National Seashore 79 Ranch CMP September 2014 Representative Quote: Increase Public Access- Currently there are limited access points for the public to enjoy 28,000 acres of the Pastoral Lands in the Point Ryes National Seashore(PRNS). Th e limited number of trail heads and parking areas should be significantly expanded to encourage the public to explore the magnificent landscape and vistas along Drakes Bay, the Pacific Ocean and Tomales Bay. For example, there is no trail connectin g the Pierce Point Ranch to Marshall Beach and no coastal trail connecting Pierce Point Ranch to the Point Reyes Lighthouse. There is no trail connect ing the Peter Behr overlook to the Chimney Rock parking area. While the southern half of the PRNS has a well developed trail system for public access and enjoyment, the pastoral zones do not. The limited access and trail syst em in place are not adequate for the growing number of visitors to th e norther section of the PRNS. Corr. ID: 2982 Representative Quote: Most of the open land in West Marin is private ranchland. Some is subject to non- development easements thanks to the Marin Agricultural Land Trust. Yet, as a rule, these lands are not open to public recreational use, sp ecifically hiking. The National Park Service is in a unique position to coordinate multiple use of Seashore lands by both ranchers and hikers. It is reasonable to hope that wh atever model develops from the Seashore's experience migh t be extended to other open lands nearby. We have already seen a magnificent collaboration with the 0.9 mile section of the Estero Trail between the Drakes Head Trail and the White Gate Trail. That section replaced a boggy swale with a gradual traverse, complete with modest culverts, for a wonderful hiking experience, through the cattle. It would be wonderful to see a similar effo rt to rejoin the Muddy Hollow trail with the old road where it crosse s Home Ranch Creek. Perhaps a bypass trail around the Home Ranch homestead would assure the rancher's privacy while allowing a through hiking route. And perhaps, like the new stretch of the Estero trail, the stretch along th e east shore of Ho me Bay could be moved away from the cattle paths and become more hiker-friendly. Finally, it will be difficult to persuade ranchers to allow hikers across working pastoral lands unless hikers can be counted upon to respect the pastoral use of the land. This is the nub of what should be a major scoping issue and goal. Corr. ID: 3000 Organization: Marin County Bicycle Coalition Representative Quote: Four decades ago, a group of forward-thinking farmers blazed trails in Sonoma Coun ty, creating the So noma County Farm Trails map and guide for local agriculture, inviting the public to meet their farmers and learn more about the origins of their food. This successful program has helped ensure the preser vation of Sonoma County's rich agricultural heritage. MCBC believes this successful model could help keep Marin's farm communities thriving th rough the combination of enhanced public access, education and economic opportunity. We recommend that the plan consider the feasibility and benefits to the Point Reyes National Seashore 80 Ranch CMP September 2014 park, ranchers and the heritage of Point Reyes of implementing a similar trail program for Marin's ranch lands. Pierce Point Road is an important access corridor from Inverness to Abbotts Lagoon, Kehoe Beach and Pierce Point Ranch. However the only way to tr avel to any of these places is along a narrow road void of shoulders. It is unlikely that hikers, walkers or equestrians would access these popular destinations any other way than with an automobile. However, if a wi de trail or ranch road were built parallel to the road, it would encourage more people to access these areas under their own power. This would achieve a variety of benefits, including: - Greater public access and an enhanced recreational experience - Reduce the number of cars pa rked along the scenic roadway - Reduce carbon emissions near the seashore - Provide an alternative for slower mo ving ranch equipment such as tractors Funding could come from grants, fund raising activities, private gifts and sources such as the Farm-to-market road and Ranch-to-market state and federal transportation fu nds currently available in other locations. Corr. ID: 3000 Organization: Marin County Bicycle Coalition Representative Quote: Connectivity There are routes being used by park visitors that currently are not designated or maintained park trails . These include a cow trail connecting the town of Olema to Bolinas Ridge and the Jewell Trail, a fire road on the north east side of Mt. Barnaby that connects with Devil's Gulch, and a ranch road on the east side of Highway 1 near Five Brooks Stables that provides access to Bolinas Ridge. We recommend that the plan evaluate adding these crucial connector routes into the Park trail network. Corr. ID: 3033 Organization: International Mountain Bicycling Association Representative Quote: Connectivity would be grea tly enhanced if the NPS improve and designate several trails that are currently being used by mountain bikers and other users. These include: - A ranch road that starts on Highway 1, just north of Five Brooks Stables, and proceeds up to Bolinas Ridge. We have been info rmed that the National Seashore intends to improve that route. We urge that this be specifically discussed in the Ranch CMP. - There is an informal cattle trail that proceeds from Olema to Bolinas Ridge, just north of Jewell Trail. This is a critical connector, and is frequently used by individuals who desire to avoid the very dangerous Sir Francis Drake Blvd. That trail must be improved and designated on maps. We suggest that a new trail segment be constructed from th e Estero Trail to the north end of the White Gate Trail. This would provide a much desired loop trail, and keep users from using the private road through Home Ranch. We also suggest a new segment of trail to connect the northern end of L Ranch Road with the Pierce Point Ro ad. This would create another loop. Point Reyes National Seashore 81 Ranch CMP September 2014 Access to the northern end of the Poin t Reyes National Seashore is provided by Pierce Point Road. This area has tremendous attractions for all users. These include Pierce Point Ranch, Ab botts Lagoon, the Kehoe Beach, and Tomales Point, which includes Bird Rock and Tomales Bluff, just across from Lawson's Landing and Sand Point. The only access to these spectacular areas is on Pierce Point Road, which is narrow, windy, and which has few shoulders. We urge the National Seashore to create a dirt road or wide trail that parallels Pierce Point Road, to provide a safe way for enthusiasts to access these places under their own power, while being protected from automobiles speeding on the road.

Other stakeholders that should be consulted include agronomists, wildlife experts, environmental groups, and concerned citizens. One commenter emphasized that collaboration and partnership between the NPS and the ranchers in th e park is essential to the planning process. One commenter suggested topics that shou ld be discussed by these parties in informal, trust-building working groups, including diversification of crops, rangeland improvements, invasive specie s, succession of rights, and elk management. Representative Quote(s): Corr. ID: 29 Representative Quote: An inclusive process is ke y. I envision a series of conversations that, by design, bring parties with different interests and outlooks together. Participants coul d divide themselves into informal working groups of 7-10 people, each group focusing on a broad issue, and each group representing a diversity of experience and interests. Participants would have two goals: 1) develop pers onal trust with those \"across the table,\" and 2) leverage that trust to re ach consensus on a range of alternative approaches to the issues being discu ssed. Those issues could include the following as well as others: 1. Diversification: For example, permitting row crops. Necessary to define type and extent, addressing, for example, water supply, management practices and the diversification agr eement, annual assessment, etc. 2. Rangeland improvement: specific ation of RDM (residual dry matter) values, assessment of soil characteristics, including slope of grazing lands, grazing monitoring programs, etc. 3. Invasive species, both flora and fa una: specify management practices, the impact on organic certification, etc. 4. Silage: high value, directly as feed source, indirectly in carbon sequestration. Assess suitability of site , limits on acreage, means of assessing impact, etc. 5. Succession of rights: should they be assigned to adjacent ranches, e.g., Horrick. Or should they be transferred to non-family producers? How is value assessed? How would lease sales be managed? 6. Elk management: assess full range of alternatives, including culling, which might have lower impact than other choices, but is politically difficult. Corr. ID: 29 Representative Quote: Essential to developing a successful management plan is a process supported by broad participation: not just the obvious stakeholders- -the ranchers and the Park Service--but agronomists, wildlife experts, various Ag groups, environm ental groups and concerned citizens. Broad constructive engagement as a goal may be much more realistic than Point Reyes National Seashore 83 Ranch CMP September 2014 the current disagreement suggests. Whatever our interests, we all presumably want the same outcome: continuing agricultural production on the NPS lands that is economically and environmentally sustainable. The participants may discover they are no t always so far apart as the current press reports suggest. People can soften their views when th ey discover the extent of agreement on long term goals. Corr. ID: 1009 Organization: Marin County Agricultural Commissioner Representative Quote: Many existing Federal, State, and local agencies are available to work in a cooperative manner with PR NS administration, field staff, and ranchers to maximize pr oductivity, resources management, and conservation practices. The United St ates Department of Agriculture - Natural Resources Conservation Serv ices (NRCS), California Resources Agency, and Marin County Resource s Conservation District (RCD), University of California Cooperative Extension (UCCE), and Marin County Agricultural Commissioner are great examples of locally available resources to assist with farm plans and project assistance. NRCS offers voluntary programs to eligible landowners and agricultural producers to provide financial and technical assistance to help manage natural resources in a sustainable manner. Through these prog rams the agency approves contracts to provide financial assistance to help plan and implement conservation practices that address natural resource concerns or opportunities to help save energy, improve soil, water, plant, air, animal and related resources on agricultural lands. The RCD has regional expertise in soil and waterway management and conservation practic es, UCCE has expertise in farm sustainability, livestock and rangeland management, the Agricultural Commissioner is the regulatory agency overseeing pesticide use and USDA Accredited Organic Farm Certification Agency. These agencies could enhance, improve, and benefit the NPS in land use, conservation, and resources management and marketing activities. Corr. ID: 1009 Organization: Marin County Agricultural Commissioner Representative Quote: The finished Environmen tal Assessment document and resulting policies should be ve tted with the Point Reyes Seashore Ranchers Association who should be allowed to be a partner in the discussion on implementation. The Ranchers Association should be the venue Park Superintendent uses to a nnounce, discuss, and direct how the EA will be utilized once certified by the National Seashore. Collectively ranchers need to understand what the Park can do that may be beneficial so they can individually and/or collect ively make sound decisions. These activities should be shared with all ranches and freely discussed within and between the Park and the ranchers. Applying Best Ranching Practices should be celebrated and recognized; le arning from each other should be a primary goal. Corr.

Having consistent protocols between borders works very well in the many ot her park boundaries we share with other stakeholders. We believe that it is imperative to have good communication and effective working relationships with all agencies within our County and we look forward to working closely with Seashore Park staff on wildlife issues. Corr. ID: 3059 Representative Quote: More collaboration between Ranchers and Park Staff.

Inthis partnership, both partners need to be stro ng or it's not a partnership. The best gauges of rancher strength are economic success and doing a good job of caring for their workers, the land, and the ranch structures. The Seashore's responsibilities are to help in at least three ways: have clear stewardship standards and clear statements of both rancher and Seashore responsibilities in implementing those standards; helping to provide resources for compliance with environmental st andards; removing or preventing unnecessary impediments to successful ranch operations (helping to get streamlined permitting; balancing natura l and cultural resource standards in ways that do not put the Seashore on a path toward unacceptable impacts or impairment of cultural or natural resources. Corr.

Moreover, the relationship between PRNS and the Seashore ranches histori cally has been exemplary of the sort of necessary harmony that we Americans might expect throughout the western US where almost half of all lives tock is grazed on public lands. The Chamber is eager to see the restorat ion of good relations between the government and agriculturalists generally. PRNS, in its establishing legislation, has embodied this spirit in the past and we are hopeful that it will again soon. Concern ID: 52182 CONCERN Commenters suggested that the NPS should form partnerships and/or STATEMENT: advisory groups to help gather stakeholders' opinions and ideas. Representative Quote(s): Corr. ID: 1009 Organization: Marin County Agricultural Commissioner Representative Quote: Ranchers identify the n eed for USDA assistance through an Environmental Quality In centive Program (EQIP) project or conservation support programs. These ac tivities have been evaluated within the agency of origin and comply with existing National Environmental Standards. The NPS should embrace and implement valuable projects without requiring a separate National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) or other lengthy review before a project can be undertaken. The National Seashore Environmental Assessment sh ould harmonize with other Federal and State agencies that have complied with EA procedures and allow for their utilization without further scruti ny. Many USDA projects are granted on an annual basis and delays in administrative approval eliminate the Seashore rancher to access while other ranchers in the region enjoy support and financial assistance. Between th e PRNS, RCD, USDA, and other noted Point Reyes National Seashore 87 Ranch CMP September 2014 agencies a very successful and collaborative approach could be reached benefitting everyone. Ranchers in the Pa rk want to be recognized as Class A and have access to all available resources. Corr. ID: 2775 Representative Quote: Rangeland management plans could be co- developed between the lessees, NRCS and NPS staff in an adaptive management approach to link agriculture and pastoralism to ecological stewardship, restoration and climate change resilience and mitigation. This approach builds on a growing movement of conservation scholars and practitioners, including those within NPS, to provide leadership in exploring integrated approaches to landscape st ewardship at a time of unprecedented global change. See: \"Speaking for the Future: A Dialogue on Conservation,\" Jan. 2003, htt p://www.nps. gov/mabi/csi/new/speakin g.htm and The Future of Working Cultural Landscapes: Parks, Partners, and Local Products, 2008, http://www.nps.gov/csi/pd f/Working Cultural Land scapes Report Full.pdf This approach also provides synergisti c support for the efforts underway in west Marin County to enhance and stre ngthen our sustainable agricultural community, including the work of our Agricultural Commissioner, the Marin Agricultural Land Trust, the Ma rin Resource Conservation District, Marin Organic, UC Cooperative Extension and the Marin Carbon Project. By taking this approach, rather than one that conceptualizes natural and cultural resources as existing in co nflict, PRNS has the opportunity to become a model for parks management around the nation, an opportunity deferred for the past 50 years. Corr. ID: 3060 Representative Quote: \" Stewardship - The Seashore needs better means to ensure that best agricultural practices are followed. The Ranch CMP should contribute to that objective. - The Seashore should create a formal relationship with a partner, advisor, or agent such as NRCS, RCD, and UC Cooperative Extension. Under that relationship, the Seashore would re tain ultimate responsibility for management of the lease I permit and ensuring that NPS policies are followed. The NPS partner could have responsibility for up to and including day-to-day management of the leas/p ermits and relations with ranchers. - The permittee and the Seashore (and its management partner, advisor, or agent, if there is one) should agree on a stewardhip plan sp ecific to the ranch with each lessee/permittee whenever a lease/permit is renewed or when there is a new lessee I permittee. Th e agreement should cover changes in generally recognized stewardship practic es and stewardship projects that are to be completed. The negotiat ed agreement should specify NPS expectations and the responsibilities of both the lessee/permittee and the NPS (and the management partner, adviso r, or agent, if there is one). The agreement should include a schedule and timetable for implementation. There should be periodic review (annual ? biennial?) to assess fulfillment of the terms of the lease/permit. The Ranch CMP should specify how the Seashore will evaluate permittee/less ee compliance with the terms of the lease/permit and what the consequences are of inadequate compliance. Point Reyes National Seashore 88 Ranch CMP September 2014 Corr. ID: 3076 Organization: Point Reyes Seashore Ranchers Association Representative Quote: This EA should evaluate the benefits of a creating and contracting with a third party non-profit with a board consisting of local agriculturalists, local range managers who regularly work with seashore ranchers, and agency representati ves to manage the day-to-day administration of the range manageme nt plan as an NPS partner. Board members would be familiar with agricultural practices in the Marin and Sonoma foodsheds and with the culture, climate, soil and market conditions that impact the ranches in the seashore. This model is consistent with NPS policies supporting local community involvement and with the UNESCO pr inciples for World Heritage Site cultural landscapes. It is particularly appropriate for working or continuing landscapes, which are often part of larger communities. The Cuyahoga Valley Rural Initiative serves as preceden t. In that instance, NPS entered into an agreement with a non-profit to manage all agricultural lands and leases within this unit. PRSRA believes that this model should be analyzed as a solution for the project area. The benefits could include: (1) Improved relationship and trust between parties; (2) Day-to-day oversight provided by individuals with experience in dealing with local conditions in an agricultural community recognized nationally and international ly as a leader in sustainable and ecologically sound agricultural p ractices; (3) More continuity, as members of the non-profit will likely have less turnover than PRNS staff; (4) Community involvement with the future of food production in the project area; and (5) Reinforced public commitment to continue viable agriculture in the project area in perpetuity.

IS1000 - Issues: Environmental Baseline Conditions Concern ID: 51782 CONCERN Commenters stated that the baseline for consideration of environmental STATEMENT: impacts under the Ranch CMP should include current lease requirements and should not include the occurrence of tule elk in the pastoral zone. Commenters also questioned how the baseline would address the removal and forage consumption of exotic deer. Representative Quote(s): Corr. ID: 2960 Organization: Marin Conservation League Representative Quote: Tule elk were extirpated from the Pt. Reyes area more than 150 years ago by a combination of hunting, logging, and ranching. Therefore, until recent years, there were no tule elk to co mpete for forage or interfere with ranching activities. Allowing a free ranging herd of tule elk in the pastoral zone was rejected as an alternative in the 1998 Elk Management Plan and EA. The Seashore's 2001 \"Yea r in Review\" acknowledged the need to \"carefully monitor\" to keep the elk outside the pastoral zone, to prevent their interfering with the cattle ranches and to ensure that the elk \"are not shedding the organism that causes John e's disease.\" Nevertheless, beginning in about 2002, the park stopped activel y managing the elk. Efforts to keep the elk out of the pastoral zone ceased. It is because some of the cattle in the pastoral zone may have Johne's disease that that herd cannot be immediately transported to Wildlands Conservancy wilderness sites, at Wildlands Conservancy expense. Under these circumstances, the development of a herd of tule elk in th e pastoral zone must be recognized as a temporary condition and not taken into account in establishing the baseline for environmental review of a ranch management plan. Corr. ID: 3036 Representative Quote: Baseline for Plan: The herd of tule elk in the pastoral zone must not be included in the baseline for the Ranch Point Reyes National Seashore 90 Ranch CMP September 2014 Management Plan. There was no public process before the currently un- leased portion of D Ranch was taken out of agriculture. There was no public process before three tule elk cows and a bull elk appeared on the un-leased portion of D Ranch less than a year later. At best allowing those tule elk to range free in the pastoral zone knowin g that they might be infected, or become infected, with Johnes or othe r infectious diseases transmittable between cattle and elk was grossly negligent management of wildlife and the pastoral zone. There is simply no circumstance under which that herd could have developed in the pastoral zone that does not reflect negatively on PRNS and its ability to manage wildli fe, or that excuses an obligation to remove the elk from the pastoral zone . Without prior environmental review of the impact of tule elk in the pastoral zone, the presence of tule elk in the pastoral zone must be recognized as a temporary condition. Corr.

The baseline for consideration of environmental impacts should be what the existing leases provide for, most of which represent existing authorized conditions and practices. If leaseholders have violat ed their permits, for instance, the unauthorized practices should not represent the baseline. Additional questions that should be considered in determining the baseline for the Ranch Plan include: 1) What impact did the removal of the several hundred exotic deer that foraged in the pastor al zone and at the Outer Point have on the amount of available forage for cows? 2) Will the level of forage consumption by the exotic deer be accounted for in the baseline? Corr. ID: 3076 Organization: Point Reyes Seashore Ranchers Association Representative Quote: Tule elk were extirpated from the subject area by the 1860s. Tule elk were not present du ring the Shafter era. Tule elk were not present when Congress entrusted the NPS to protect the seashore, the ranches and farms and the people on the ranches and farms. Only a few years ago, NPS decided to re-introdu ce tule elk to the 18,000 acre designated elk range locat ed entirely within the Limantour wilderness area. By this time (1998), it was well known that introduced tule elk in an area without predators could become highly invasive. The current elk management plan reassured seashore ra nchers at the time that the ranch lands would be protected because the plan stated that the elk would not negatively affect any other permitted use (long-standing ranch SUPs) and the plan included tools to manage elk overpopulation, including contraception, relocation and culling. For some years, PRNS interpreted the plan just as the ranchers interpret it and kept the elk off of the ranch lands.1 The Seashores 2001 Year in Review (a ttachment D) acknowledged the need to carefully monitor to keep the elk outside the pastoral zone, to prevent their interfering with the cattle ranche s and to ensure that the elk are not shedding the organism that causes Johnes disease.

One co mmenter suggested that the Ranch CMP fully describe the need for the NEPA process at this time to continue current ranching operations that ha ve occurred for a 150-year timeframe while there was not a requirement for NE PA for past changes of land use in the park. Representative Quote(s): Corr. ID: 3070 Organization: McIsaac Ranch Representative Quote: We have been told that NEPA requires PRNS to review the environmental co nsequences of a change of use, or change of intensity of use, of the ranchlands. Th is might be why PRNS has started this current process. If this is true, this EA process should share with the public and evaluate the NEPA process that was undertaken by PRNS to radically change a 150-year stable baseline of grazing by removing the historic agricultural activity on the Jewell Ranc h. At the time, because of previous similar decisions to exclude livestock from the wilderness areas, PRNS would have known that removing grazing would result in a loss of the cultural working landscape, an adver se effect on the local economy, a dramatic change in the rangeland plant and animal communities and a significant increase in the risk of wil dfires. If PRNS made its decisions to remove grazing from the Jewell Ranch, or any other ranch, without a formal NEPA process, this EA must fully evalu ate if an EA is actually required to resume the 150 year baseline activity. If PRNS declares that NEPA review is required here, this EA must fully explain why, if no formal process was undertaken for the removal of grazing, a formal NEP A process is required to resume the historic , base line activity of grazing .

During the cultural pe riod focused upon in this assessment, the Shafter era, an extremely diversi fied agricultural network existed. During this period there were thousands of acres in crop production, a myriad of livestock species being raised, oysters being harvested, processing facilities for milk, cheese, butter, meat and crops and spring forages were being harvested and stored for winter livestock feeding. The current baseline looks very similar to what has existed for 150 years, with a few exceptions. Today most of those activities are permitted by PRNS on some ranches, but not all. If an activ ity is currently allowed, it should be part of the current environmental baseline. For example, the current baseline includes dairy and beef operations, storage of on-farm harvested Point Reyes National Seashore 92 Ranch CMP September 2014 forage for livestock feeding, small scale row crops, poultry raising, oyster farming, bed and breakfast operations, on-farm sales of products raised in the seashore, horse boarding and on - farm tours and interpretation. Allowing all ranchers the same author izations to undertake activities that PRNS already allows for some ranchers should not require an EA. Only new activities, not a part of the current base line, should be the subject of this EA.

IS1100 - Issues: Ranch Operations, Activities, and Management (past, present, and future) Concern ID: 51870 CONCERN Commenters noted that ranchers have been a part of the landscape for STATEMENT: generations and that maintaining agricu lture in the park is important to agriculture both locally and nationa lly. Because farmers and ranchers in West Marin County are pioneers in sustainable and organic practices, Point Reyes National Seashore 94 Ranch CMP September 2014 agriculture in this area is critical to the future of the national food supply. Additionally, maintaining agriculture in the park is important to maintaining the support services, marketing opportunities, and economic sustainability for agriculture locally. Representative Quote(s): Corr.

These are families that have been part of this landscape for generations who probably now wish that they had never sold to the Park and are being told by Washington how to run their lands.. As far as I can tell they are good stewards of the land and the oyster farm has been there as far back as I can remember. Corr. ID: 1697 Representative Quote: Insofar as NPS policies could contribute to ranches in the Seashore going out of business , the secondary impacts of the reduced demand for agricultural services in Marin and Sonoma counties must be assessed. Local agricultural officials an d other experts have stated, in recent years, that they are co ncerned about the levels of demand for ag services dropping below the levels that allow certain suppl iers of inputs, or certain processors of outputs, to stay in business. The loss of some of these services would likely increase production costs, or reduce prices obtained, and so make agriculture less financially feasib le in the Seashore and elsewhere in Marin county. Corr. ID: 3048 Organization: Sonoma Marin Veterinary Service Representative Quote: Local food, natural food, these have become touchstones in our modern attempt to balance our desire to live well and yet live within the bounds of nature's li mits. The ranchers of the seashore represent this ideal by both preserving their long standing traditions and adopting new ideas as is witnessed by the recent expansion of certified organic production within the seashore . If ranching cannot succeed within the seashore, then any goal of local, sustainable food production within the San Francisco Bay area is deeply wounded. Corr. ID: 3057 Organization: Marin County Agricultural Commissioner Representative Quote: Point Reyes National Seashore ranches and dairies operating in the Point Reyes .National Seashore (PRNS) account for nearly 20% ($16.8 million) of all gross agricultural production in Marin County. These ranches and dairies play a critical role in maintaining the viability of Marin County's agricultur al system. There are 16 livestock ranches and 7 dairy operations in the PRNS. Ranching and farm culture in \"West Marin Point\" has gone on for over 150 years. Their history stems from the \"Gold Rush-49er Era\" and framed by the \"Shaft er Era\" giving way to today's multi- generations family operations. Interestin gly, all dairies in the Seashore area are Certified Organic under the USDA National Organic Program, certified by the Marin County Agricultural Commissioner and other accredited Point Reyes National Seashore 95 Ranch CMP September 2014 organic certifiers demonstrating the progressive nature and willingness to support animal health, and environm ental protection. Collectively, the entire Pastoral area of the Seashore Ag ricultural region represents one of the largest contiguous organically certif ied areas in California, possibly the nation. This is a pinnacle in terms of production model and land sustainability. Corr. ID: 3063 Representative Quote: This EA should recognize all the benefits of allowing me to return home. I will provide the rangeland stewardship to preserve the historic grassl ands, I will bring the same cattle back to their rightful home, and I will save the taxpayers by relievi ng the PRNS of the sole responsibility for maintenance to fencing, roads, buildings and other infrastructure. I will help to preserve th e pastoral zone with the cultural use Congress intended for it. Corr. ID: 3074 Organization: Sonoma State University Representative Quote: In the recent past, NPS management of the Seashore has been increasingly out of step, both with these changes to heritage preservation at the global scale, but also changes to the agricultural economy at the local scal e. While PRNS has taken ranches out of operation and is attempting to shutter the oyst er farm, the rest of West Marin has turned into an amazing hub of food production and consumption, a mecca of modem sustainable agriculture. Most of the area's dairies and beef ranches have gone organic and/or primarily grass-fed. There has been a huge increase in artisanal cheese-making, and overall a broader diversification of agriculture, including production of more vegetables, chickens, etc. Organic production of all kinds of agricultural goods has moved from being a fringe activity to the economic mainstream of West Marin, as part of a broader nation-wide movement. In particular, pardy in reaction to the 2002 federal definition of \"organic\" and the increasing presence of industrial-scale producti on of organic products, many West Marin producers have focused more on emphasizing local and seasonal production. The area's proximity to the high-end metropolitan market of the larger Bay Area that seems increasi ngly willing to pay the higher prices for premium agricultural products has given West Marin a new boost of confidence that food production is not doomed to disappear, as has been presumed to be almost in evitable since the 1950s. The agricultural operations on PRNS and GGNRA lands represent a substantial portion of this economy, contributing 17 percent of Marin's overall agricultural production and 17 percent of its agricultural land base. The 2007 Marin Countywide Plan lists among its core goals the protection of the area's working agricultural landscapes, and greater community food security by increasing the availability and diversity of locally-produced foods. Grazing on these lands also provides important ecosystem services, such as managing non-native weedy species and reducing fire danger. And most of the ranching families have hist oric connections to the land that go back through generations, helping to anchor the overall community's sense Point Reyes National Seashore 96 Ranch CMP September 2014 of identity and place. Corr. ID: 3075 Representative Quote: More and more global food production has been contaminated by Genetically Modifi ed Organisms, pesticides, is being provided by Big Ag., or shipped long distances, wasting precious natural resources. What we have in Marin, especially within the Seashore, should serve as an example to agriculture everywhere about how things can and should be done. Concern ID: 51832 CONCERN Commenters expressed concern over curre nt ranching conditions including STATEMENT: cruelty to animals, use of antibiotics, im pacts to wildlife and wildlife habitat, impacts to water quality, impacts to soils, impacts to air quality, and contributions to climate change.

Congress sh owed great vision by providing for ranching to continue with in the Seashore to ensure that future generations would be able to experience the park's unique working landscapes. That vision, and the many benefits it represents for the park and our region, is worth protecting. That's why we are writing to express our firm commitment to ensuring that environmentally and economically sustainable agriculture remains a permanent part of the Point Reyes National Seashore. Corr. ID: 3076 Organization: Point Reyes Seashore Ranchers Association Representative Quote: The members of the PRSR A provide a number of important environmental, educational and economic benefits to the area. Ranchers have had most of the agric ultural land within the seashore certified organic. Ranchers work closely with the Marin County Resource Conservation District (MRCD) and the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) to adopt new conserva tion practices and implement on the ground projects to protect and improve natural resources. Most of these beneficial projects come by choice, and at the financial expense of the historic rancher or farmer. PRSRA members provide exceptional educational opportunities. Member s of PRSRA partner with other organizations and agencies to help inform the public about the benefits of family farming. One PRSRA member, the Drakes Bay Oyster Farm, provides on-farm educational opportunities for schools, organizations and roughly 50,000 members of the visiting publ ic annually. PRSRA members produce over 20% of Marin Countys agricultural products, generally, and more than half of Marin Countys oysters, specifically. The land in the Olema Valley and Point Reyes Historic Ranch Distri cts constitutes approximately 25% of the land available for agriculture in Marin County toda y. The ranchers within the project area provide a significant number of jobs as well as affordable housing for their employees. The milk, beef and other farm products flowing into our local region provide more economic opportunities for the region through distribution, retail and restaurants featuring local farm products.

Small family farms have realized that the secret to survival is to begin to move away from large scale single commodity monoculture and refocus on small scale diversified agriculture and local markets. The local marketing allows small farmers to build local relationships, collaborate with other ranchers on value added products processing and distribution. This \"new\" model is actually a recreation of the traditional diversified farms found on the Point Reyes peninsula during the Shafter era, not long before it became a unit of the NPS.

IS1150 - Issues: Agriculture and Agriculture Leases (past, present, and future) Concern ID: 51881 CONCERN One commenter indicated that, due to th e short-term nature of SUPs, it is STATEMENT: economically unfeasible for ranchers to undertake costly, long-term management actions on their property. Another commenter stated that, due to existing permit language, ranching operations are not properly appraised because they often do not take into account capital improvements. Representative Quote(s): Corr.

Although short-term SUPs are intended to prevent or limit serious damage to park lands, ironically, they act as a negative incentive to basic land stewardship. It is economically infeasible for farmers to undertake costly long-term land care programs, which can take years or decades to implement, since they have little assura nce of a reasonable return on their investment. The leasing authority now available for the Countryside Initiative resolves this inherent dilemma. Corr. ID: 3092 Organization: Point Reyes Seashore Ranchers Association Representative Quote: PRSRA is concerned that when rural land appraisals are completed by PRNS contractors, the appraisers are unaware that it is the rancher or farmer that has usually pa id for capital improvements, not the NPS as the permits suggest. The resulting appraisal may be higher than if the appraiser knew the rancher actually has to pay for capital improvements. Concern ID: 51876 CONCERN Many commenters stated that ranchers have already been paid for their land, STATEMENT: their leases have expired, and they are currently paying artificially low lease prices that are being subsidized by the taxpayers.

Starting in 1969 and thoughout the 70s, millions of dollars were paid to the ranching families on the Coastal Prairie now called \"The Pastoral Zone.\" Ranchers signed 20-year-leas es, which have all expired. Soon after signing their 20 year leases ranchers hired lobbyists to take their case to Washington, D.C. so that they could keep the money, remain on the park lands in perpetuity, while continuing to pay artificially low leases. Corr. ID: 2568 Representative Quote: Ranchers, since the earl y 70's have been paid millions of dollars and were supposed to vacate the land. It clearly seems they have an expensive lobbyist in Wash ington DC to push around those in charge in order to ensure they can stay forever. However, they are now becoming more aggressive and arrogant and are so puffed up with confidence that they push people off of what they think is \"Their Land\" even Point Reyes National Seashore 101 Ranch CMP September 2014 though it isn't. Corr. ID: 3064 Organization: In Defense of Animals Representative Quote: Furthermore, according to Western Watersheds Project, \"The cost of public lands ranching to American taxpayers is enormous. The current public land grazing fee of $1.35 per month for one cow and her calf is woefully below market value. Direct government expenditures to administer public land grazing constitute an annual net loss to the taxpayers of at least $123 mill ion and more than $500 million when indirect costs are accounted for. As much as 96% of these public dollars are spent to enhance livestock production in direct conflict with legal mandates to restore the health \"of public lands\"' (http://www.westernwatersheds.org/is sues/public-land s-ranching/) The situation at PRNS is not any di fferent. Ranchers have been paying grazing fees at about $7 per cow and her calf per month, which is about half of the going price to rent grazing land outside the park in Marin County. These artificially lo w fees are being subsidized by the public, a fact that has been rightfully termed \"welfare ranching. Corr.

As of 2007, agricultural operations on PRNS ranches contribute d 17% oe direct agricultural income in Marin County, yet most PRNS ranchi ng families have no future security, as they are operating under five-year SUPs. What that means to a beef cattle operation is that investment in infrastr ucture such as fencing for improved grazing management cannot be capitalized over the life of their SUPs, creating a disincentive for improving ranch operations. Since 2007, feed prices for both cattle and dairy operat ions have skyrocketed, especially for organic operations. Additionally, organic dairy and livestock grazing operations are required by the USDA National Organic Program to meet 30% onual forage requirements over 120 days per tear from pasture. Therefore, any decrease in PRNS past ure acreage, or competition for forage from tule elk, threaten organic production and the economic stability of PRNS ranches.

At the international level, world heritage management policy is increasingly articulated as the protection of bot h cultural and natural resources and values, emphasizing local uniqueness and community input into management. For example, UNESCO's 2009 World Heritage Cultural Landscapes: A Handbook for Conservati on and Management identifies six guiding principles in its management framework: a.

Representative Corr. ID: 3022 Organization: University of California Quote(s): Cooperative Extension Representative Quote: Cultural Landscapes and Historic Structures. The preservation of local traditions and significant cultural landscapes is an important element of the NPS mission and mandate (Sadin, 2007). The cultural landscape of PRNS encompasses thousands of years of changing land uses. In times past, diversified farms were the norm, including large acreages of row crops and dairy processing. Although Point Reyes agriculture was best known for dairy pr oduction in the late 1800s and early- to mid-1900s, between 1935, when the first Marin County Crop Report was issued, and 1942, hundreds of acres of artichokes and peas were grown in what is now PRNS (Livingston, 2009; http://www.marincounty. org/depts/ag/crop-reports). The cultural landscape supported diverse farms and ranches that produced most everything that farm families needed to live on, as well as the crops that allowed them to be economically sustai nable. Preserving examples of this diverse cultural landscape is every bit as important to the history of the Point Reyes areas, as preserving historic structures. Concern ID: 51885 CONCERN Commenters stated that, without the full support by the NPS regarding STATEMENT: requests made by the ranc hers within the park, the NPS is contributing to the loss of a cultural resource.

This gives new hope that our ranches and farms will survive as viable businesses into the future. Without giving full support of the points and requests made in the PRSRA letter, NPS will actually be contributi ng to the elimination of the ranches and the loss of an important cultural resource.

Representative Corr.

If a rancher, with NPS approval, voluntarily goes above and beyond what is required by agreement for resource conservation, a monetary value can be attached to those services. The ranchers can be reimbursed through credits toward rent. This concept has been used by land managers in other situations. PRSRA believes that this concept could be useful to build collaboration between ranchers and PRNS to further the natural resource conservation and greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction goals of PRNS. IS1300 - Issues: Natural Resource Management (past, present, and future) Concern ID: 51890 CONCERN Commenters stated that the Ranch CM P should consider the value of STATEMENT: grazing to preserve and restore native grasslands in the park and in Golden Gate National Recreation Ar ea and to reopen lands previously taken out of agriculture to ranching operations for lease/permit. Representative Quote(s): Corr. ID: 3022 Organization: University of California Cooperative Extension Representative Quote: California grasslands have suffered great losses from development and conversion to other habitat types. In ungrazed grasslands, especially those that abut or intergrade with shrub lands, shrub invasion can result in vegetation type conversion, and thus, loss of the grassland species. Significant acreage has been lost to shrub invasion at PRNS in areas where grazing has b een removed. We encourage PRNS to reopen lands to agriculture within th e pastoral zone and Golden Gate National Recreation Area (GGNRA ) that have been taken out of production in recent years. Not only would this provide more acreage for PRNS ranching families, it would allow restoration of open grassland habitat that has been converted to shrublands: Point Reyes National Seashore 107 Ranch CMP September 2014 http://www.elkhornsloug hctp.org/uploads/files/1184014268Nothern_Co astal_Scrub_Coastal_Prairie.pdf; http://www.elkhornsloughctp.org/reference/subi ssue_detail.php?SUBISS UE_ID=4 Ranchers and their lives tock have been and continue to be the most effective vegetation managers working on PRNS lands. Livestock grazing, under the management of highly expe rienced specialists (the ranchers) maintain grassland vegetat ion and prevent type conversion to shrublands, and are responsible for maintaining habitat conditions required by many special-status species. Unlike native tule elk, domestic livestock numbers and grazing patterns are controlled by their managers to meet economic and resource management objectives: http://ucanr.org/sites/uccemarin/files/31000.pdf Concern ID: 51887 CONCERN Commenters stated that the natural re sources present in the park should STATEMENT: be protected and preserved.

Concern ID: 51888 CONCERN Commenters indicated that natural resources management cannot be STATEMENT: applied within the cultural landscape in the same way that this management is applied elsewhere in the park and suggested that the Ranch CMP include a discussion of how natural resources management will be dealt with on agricultural lands. Representative Quote(s): Corr.

This se ction should be explicit that, if agriculture is to exist in the Seashore , NPS policies on biological resource management can not be applied in a cultural landscape in exactly the same way as in other areas of the Seashore.** For example, grazing cattle, growing and harvesting grasses for si lage, and various forms of rangeland maintenance are all activities that ar e inappropriate in other areas of the Seashore but are routine agricultural practices necessary for ranches to Point Reyes National Seashore 108 Ranch CMP September 2014 function. To expand on one of those examples, silage is important economically for ranchers and lowers carbon footprint compared to trucked in feed but involves soil an d vegetation alteration that would not normally occur in a national park, is a potentially a negative for some wildlife species (nesting grassland birds, for example), and benefits some other species (some wintering bird species, for example). IS1400 - Issues: Tule Elk Management on Ranchlands (past, present, and future) Concern ID: 51893 CONCERN Several commenters stated that ranchers do not have the right to impact the STATEMENT: elk and provided reasons for elk to remain in the area, including: they are the native grazers and belong in the area, they serve an important role to the ecosystem, they represent an important species to conserva tion history, the land belongs to the public and to the wi ldlife, and the elk resided in this area long before people. These comment ers also expressed concern that ranching activities are impacting the elk and that threats exist to their health if they are not properly managed. Representative Quote(s): Corr. ID: 20 Representative Quote: The situation concerning Tule Elk and cattle ranchers in the Point Reyes National Seashore(PRNS) should be one of no debate. Tule Elk are a flagship species for the ecosystems of which they reside, and a significant symbol in re gards to species conservation. They have been found historically in PRNS for many generations before ranchers have ever settled in the area, and in fact were once driven to local extinction in the Pt Reyes area due to cattle ranching. Corr. ID: 20 Representative Quote: The idea of putting ranchers before the flora and fauna of PRNS, as well as the consideration of allowing hunting of Tule Elk anywhere on PRNS is a major contradiction to the National Parks Service mission statement. If ranchers are put be fore Tule Elk, it will be a major set back in species conservation, as well as an atrocity to the National Parks Service. Corr. ID: 1015 Organization: Tule Elk foundation Representative Quote: Tule Elk should be the #1 priority on National Park/National Seashore lands (NPS). If Tule Elk are not fully protected on National Park lands, then where will Tule Elk be protected in the State of California? Just a reminder, that Tu le Elk (Cervus Canadensis nannodes) once numbered 500,000 th roughout their native habi tat in California. Tule Elk now number only about 4,000 in California. With the long-term concerns of the genetic health of the Tule Elk- every elk population is critical for the long-term health and vi ability of Tule Elk statewide. One of the important traits of Tule Elk is their incredible \"adaptability\" to changes in their environment but that adaptability has its limits especially as the Tule Elk are \"managed\" by humans. The Tule Elk's long-term health is dependent Point Reyes National Seashore 109 Ranch CMP September 2014 upon free-roaming populations that live 'unimpaired by human influence\". Corr. ID: 1022 Organization: In Defense of Animals Representative Quote: Tule elk are not affecting park ranch operations, but vice versa, privately-owned ranch operatio ns within the PRNS affect tule elk in that they prevent tule elk from mi grating freely and fr om occupying those areas they prefer within the pastoral zone. Corr. ID: 1038 Organization: The Wildlife Trust Representative Quote: Much is made by today's PRNS commercial leasees and permitees of the \"historic\" cattle grazing that has taken place on the Pt. Reyes peninsula over the last couple of hundred years. Ho wever, it must be understood that the real historic grazers in this area and over much of the rest of California are tule elk, along with deer and pronghorn antelope. For at least 10,000 years, even before the Coast Miwok arrived, tule elk have grazed the grasslands of California, including the coastal prairies and brush- fields of what has become Pt. Reyes National Seashore thousands of years later. This historic grazing by tule elk has been constant except for the relatively short period in the 1800s and 1900s, when market hunters and ranchers eliminated them from the most of California, including along the Coast. Concern ID: 51894 CONCERN One commenter discussed the status of th e tule elk as an \"umbrella\" species STATEMENT: that represents long-term restoration ef forts in California that should be given priority over cattle grazing. The same commenter described the reintroduction of the elk to Tomales Point as a historical note to the restoration of the species and to the future of restoration ecology in general. Representative Quote(s): Corr. ID: 1015 Organization: Tule Elk foundation Representative Quote: The NPS should also consider its historical role and involvement in the early 1970's as a ke y stakeholder in the reintroduction of Tule Elk into Point Reyes National Seashore. According to your website statement and the historical record: \"State and Federal legislation in the early 1970's, authorized the California Department of Fish and Game (now the Cal Dept of Fish & Wildlife), in cooperation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Park Service, to reintroduce the extirpated Tule Elk to Tomales Point. As a result , 10 animals (8 females and 2 males) were transplanted from an existing reintroduced herd in the San Luis National Wildlife Refuge near Los Bano s to a 2,600 acre fenced enclosure on Tomales Point in 1978.\" (http:// www.nps.gov/pore/naturescience/tule elk.htm) These initial historical restoration efforts were an essential step in restoring the Tule Elk as a public good and a part of the Public Trust Doctrine movement. These early pioneers and the dedicated efforts to restore the native California la ndscape were instrumental in the eventual public policy and practices of restoration ecology, landscape ecology, ecosystem management, sustainable studies and wild life science. These newly practiced Point Reyes National Seashore 110 Ranch CMP September 2014 disciplines are now widespread thro ughout the outstanding academic institutions within California and nationwide. Students and the public embrace and support these practices as \"core\" to the mission of National Parks, State Parks and other public la nds. These practices are also being adopted on private lands. This vast movement supports the Public Trust Doctrine that wildlife are held in trus t for present and future generations. Corr. ID: 1015 Organization: Tule Elk foundation Representative Quote: Tule Elk, a California endemic species, are considered an \"umbrella\" or focal sp ecies for North America. Tule Elk represent the long-term efforts by the State of California, Federal Government (Tule Elk Preservation Act of 1976), the public and non-profits to restore this large free-roaming nati ve herbivore to the landscape over the last nearly 80 years. The reintroduction of Tule elk may be one of the largest restoration efforts in the history of California and possibly the nation. Since the original efforts to reintroduce Tule elk throughout its native habitat over nearly 80 years - the ci tizens of California, leadership and resource agencies are at a crossroads! When will Tule Elk take priority over European cattle/dairy grazing practices- which were integral in destroying much of the native landscape of California? Cattle/dairy operations still dominate the California native landscap e - found throughout California and as well as nationwide. Our National la nds, and specifically restricted-use lands such as a National Park, must be a safe haven for free-roaming Tule Elk in California! And we are only talking about ONE National Park within California where free-roaming Tule Elk ARE NOW FOUND (only since 1998- a mere 16 years)! Concern ID: 51896 CONCERN Several commenters stated that elk are threatening ranchers' ability to raise STATEMENT: quality food and meet consumer demand with impacts that include: damage to fences, damage to water sources, damage to irrigation lines, spread of disease, impacts to grazing and native pastures, impacts to organic forage and certifications, and threats to the economic survival of ranches due to costs incurred from elk impacts.

I do not know of a humane yet practical soluti on to this problem, and it is one that has never been adequately addressed by the Park. Another sharpshooter rampage to deal with it when it reaches catastroph ic proportions would certainly not go down well with the public, besides being very expensive. Corr. ID: 3019 Representative Quote: It seems the National Pa rk System was willing to introduce this form of wildlife to seem ingly bring back biodiversity of years past, but without the willingness to allo w for the cycle of life. If elk truly inhabited Point Reyes Peninsula generati ons ago, then I am sure the farmers and ranchers hunted them without much regulation (as this has not always been public property) which created a healthy check and balance of the population. Obviously, today, the elk are being protected by the park and have only one true predator, the coyote to worry about. At this same time, the populations of elk are not under any sort of control regarding where and when they roam through the various properties. Concern ID: 51900 CONCERN One commenter questioned background information provided in scoping STATEMENT: materials, indicating that ranchers and the public had raised concerns related to tule elk and their impacts on ranch operations.

Concern ID: 51901 CONCERN One commenter noted that, prior to 2002, the NPS managed elk following STATEMENT: the 1998 Elk Management Plan to avoid harm to other permitted uses, but in 2002, this management ceased. Representative Corr. ID: 3092 Organization: Point Reyes Seashore Ranchers Quote(s): Association Representative Quote: The 1998 Elk Management Plan recognizes the fact that introduced tule elk can become invasive and have the potential to adversely affect seashore resources, including cattle. The plan is clear that PRNS is to manage the elk so that th ey do not harm any other permitted use within the seashore. To manage the ex pected elk proliferation and to avoid harm to other permitted uses, the plan allows the PRNS and CDFW to use capture and relocation of wayward elk, contraception of elk, and even lethal culling. For the first several years follow ing the 1998 public process and plan approval, PRNS utilized all of these approved tools to manage the elk and kept them off the pastoral zone. During these years there was no controversy because everyone interpre ted the plan the same way. The contraception program appeared to be hugely successful (see Science & Conservation Center letter, Attachment C). When a rogue elk appeared on a ranch, the rancher called the seashore staff and the animal was tranquilized and brought back to the designated elk range. In at least one case, a repeat intruder was shot and killed by PRNS. The PRNS was quite clear, and understood their responsibility when they looked back at 2001 in the PRNS publication Point Reyes National Seashore 2001 Year in Review (attachment D) where PRNS stated Since their rele ase, the new herd has been carefully monitored to ensure animals remain within Seashore boundaries, do not interfere with cattle ranches within the park and are not shedding the organism that causes Johnes disease. (emphasis added) Unfortunately, and still without explanation, sometime ar ound 2002, PRNS ceased management of the tule elk. Contraception ceased. Relocation ceased. Culling ceased. At the time tule elk management ended, PRNS began to allow tule elk to proliferate in the pastoral zone and harm the ranchers- - -the very permitted use the plan set out to protect. Concern ID: 51902 CONCERN One commenter stated that a map being used in the current Ranch CMP STATEMENT: materials is misleading because it does not include the designated elk range. Representative Corr. ID: 3076 Organization: Point Reyes Seashore Ranchers Quote(s): Association Representative Quote: The 1998 Elk Management includes a map that clearly describes, with a distinct line around the perimeter, the 18,000 acre designated elk range. The 1998 plan st ates that the PRNS would establish the Point Reyes National Seashore 113 Ranch CMP September 2014 free ranging elk herd within those 18,000 acres. This range intended for the elk does not include any ranch land and is fully located within the Limantour wilderness area. The current CMP EA materials include a similar map showing where the elk currently exist, but now excludes the designated elk range. This is misleading. The pu blic may not know that the elk have been allowed to proliferate outside th e limits of the designated elk range found in the current elk management plan. By failing to include the designated elk range in the map, the pu blic has not been properly informed to provide meaningful comments on th e EA. The PRNS, its contractors and its experts must consider the fact that the public was given this misleading map prior to commenting. Concern ID: 51903 CONCERN One commenter noted that there is no re search indicating that elk are eating STATEMENT: grass needed by cattle, and there is th erefore no valid clai m by the ranchers that they are being put out of business by elk grazing in the area. Representative Quote(s): Corr. ID: 3009 Representative Quote: I do not believe there is any research showing that the elk are actually taking away grass th at needs to be eaten by the cattle. Thus, the claim that the elk will be pu tting the ranchers out of business is only an idea. I understand that in one ar ea there is a very large herd, and that perhaps this herd is more likely to actually do some 'damage' to the pastureland. On the other hand this herd stays at least part of the time in ranchlands that had used to belong to a ranch which is closed. IT1000 - Impact Topic: Geological Resources (erosion, stream incision, streambanks/streambeds, quarries) Concern ID: 51906 CONCERN Commenters noted that the Ranch CMP should address the impacts of STATEMENT: ranching operations including changes to soil compaction and structure, soil erosion, soil biology, increased nitrogen deposition, surface and subsurface water quality, contribution to GHG emissions, waste disposal, and an increase in invasive species. Commenters stated that BMPs should be evaluated for soil management, topsoil preservation, and prevention of erosion. One commenter noted that previous efforts to protect from these impacts involved annual measurements of residual dry matter. One commenter stated that the Ranch CMP should describe the current condit ions of water quality and quantity in the project area and evaluate consistency with the Organic Act providing \"maximum protection, restoration, and preservation\" to natural resources, and consider various published sources of information including a paper discussing off-stream water sources and erosion for cattle.

If they are not in good condition, the Park Service should discuss what needs to be done to remediate the impairment of natural values and provide them with \"maximum protection, restoration and preservation\" as required by the park's enabling legislation and the Organic Act. In this regard, the Park Service should discuss whether livestock should be fenced out of water courses and we tlands. Doing so would prevent their hooves from causing erosion by damaging the banks and beds of streams and would reduce the amount of cattle urine and feces that contaminate the streams. Water troughs can be used to provide water to the cattle away from the watercourse. The same discussion should be had as to ponds. Troughs can be provided at a reasonable dist ance from the ponds.

Over 50 plants at PRNS are currently listed by the Federal government, State government, or the California Native Plant Society as being rare, threatened , or endangered. The required establishment of critical habitat for the listed threated and endangered species is vital to their recovery at PR NS in general and within the Pastoral Zone in particular. Corr.

The California Natura l Diversity Database (\"CNDDB\") includes the following animal species ma ny of which will be affected by the Ranch CMP: , tricolored blackbird , pallid burrowing Tomales western sandy beach tiger monarch butterfly yellow w arbler western p water scaven ger beetle Point Reyes National Seashore 123 Ranch CMP September 2014 , San Francisco forktail damselfly , black rail , Tomales salmon - central California California Marin hesperian , Point Reyes jumping mouse (see full comment for scientific names) Livestock grazing and grazing related in frastructure may directly, indirectly and cumulatively impact all these animal species. Impacts include direct trampling and disturbance, habitat disturbance, loss of cover, changes in shrub density, loss of prey species, and changes in hydrology and water quality. Field research has shown that light to moderate grazing reduces rodent densities and diversity, rodents are important prey items for many of these species (for examples see Jone s 2000; Moser and Witmer, 2000; Organization: Western Watersheds Project Representative Quote: The CNDDB includes th e following rare plant species most of which will be affected by the Ranch CMP: , pink sand-verbena , Vision ceanothus Point Reyes National Seashore 124 Ranch CMP September 2014 , Point Reyes salty triquetrella (see full comment for scientific names) These plants are susceptible to being eaten by cattle, being trampled by cattle, and to modifications of local hydrology and localized soil compaction induced by cattle and livestock operations and infrastructure. In order to comply with NEPA, the Fo rest Service needs to perform a site- Point Reyes National Seashore 125 Ranch CMP September 2014 specific review and analysis of the effects of the proposed action and alternatives on all these plant and animal species. This should include documentation of all recent surveys. The NPS should ensure that adequate safeguards are in place in the Ranch CMP to protect these species and their habitats and that any impacts to them are adequately mitigated. The NEPA analysis should include consideration of the direct, indirect and cumulative effects of the proposed action on these rare plants and their habitat. Corr. ID: 3045 Representative Quote: According to BNA, early-season mowing of hayfields and other agricultural lands is generally responsible for major nest failure of grassland birds, including Grasshopper Sparrows and, in general, contemporary farming practices i nvolve cutting hayfields more frequently, and earlier, in spring than 50 years ago; these practices have had significant negative impacts on nesting success of grassland birds (Rodenhouse et al. 1995). Population decline of Grasshopper Sparrow and many grassland birds has been recognized as a national and regional conservation priority (Knopf 1994, Vickery et al. in press). Ha bitat loss, initially of native prairies and grasslands but subsequently of ha yfields and pastures throughout much of this species' breeding range has been the primary factor affecting this sparrow's long-term population decline (Vickery et al. in press). Grasshopper Sparrows (as well as nearly the complete majority of other bird species in this country) are federally protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918, which says that it is \"unlawful without a waiver to pursue, hunt, take, capture, kill or sell birds listed therein (\"migratory bi rds\"). The statute does not discriminate between live or dead birds and also grants full protection to any bird parts including feathers, eggs and nests.\" Additionally, Grasshopper Sparrows are a California Species of Special Concern, Second Priority as determin ed by a ranking score based on seven criteria (Shuford and Gardali 2008). There is a conundrum here, and I'd li ke to see if something can be done about it: The hayfield provides good habitat for grassland birds. At the same time, I'm sure the ranchers make an in come from the hay and/or use it to feed their own livestock and it's pr obably important to time mowing properly to maximize hay nutrient content and quality. I assume that delaying mowing until after the breeding season is probably not an option(?), although that would be the be st one. In this specific situation, though, there might be a way to find a balance between the ranchers hay- growing and harvesting operation and protection of nesting birds, particularly Grasshopper Sparrows. One idea that comes to mind at the moment is that once the hay has matured and is ready for harvest, a biological survey of the area to be mowed could be conducted and if necessary, a protective buffer could be determined and established between the habitat occupied by the Grasshop per Sparrows and the area that is mowed. Point Reyes National Seashore 126 Ranch CMP September 2014 Concern ID: 51920 CONCERN STATEMENT: Commenters stated that the scope of the Ranch CMP should only evaluate new impacts, and changes from the stat us quo, of ranching operations to species of special concern (plant or animal; federally listed or proposed for listing or their habitat; stat e listed).

Reyes pr obably developed under light grazing pressure by elk and with frequent fires set by native peoples...The shift from elk to cattle that accompanied European colonization changed the grazing pattern from seasonal to year round, increasing the intensity of the grazing pressure and favoring a shift from prairie to range land. As early as 1793, a Spanish lieutenant named De Goyecha described the peninsula as 'very good pasture and springs in all parts, very appropriate for raising of cattle of all kinds and very exte nsive'; the fate of the pristine prairie was sealed. As a result of grazing pre ssure and intentional plowing, burning and planting, most native perennial grasses were replaced by immigrants. The disappearance of antelope and elk soon followed. Where grazing has ceased or not occurred, the combined influence of climate and soil types favor perennial plants...however this natural advantage is overcome by domestic livestock. Intensive grazing causes a reduction in plant vigor and removes a critical amount of mulch, thereby tilting the balance in favor of exotic annual species. When cattle are removed the community tends to revert to native perennials, although it may never recover completely'. Jules C. Evens, the Natural Histor y of the Point Reyes Peninsula. Corr.

The distribution of invasive plant species in the pastoral zone should be mapped. Cattle are effective agents in dispersing exotic species and may disperse more than an order of magnitude more seeds than elk and deer per animal (Bartuszevige and Endress, 2008 ). Cattle can break and de grade protective soil crusts and thus increase the ability of invasive sp ecies to become established. The contribution of historic and current cattle grazing on invasive species distribution should be analyzed including the role of livestock in damaging sensitive soil crusts that can reta rd the spread of invasive plants.

Rancho Baulines has been grazed for thousands of year s, first by elk and deer while being occupied by the Miwok. Later it became the Wilkins dairy. Removing most all grazers is leading to the increasing fuel load, the loss of the grasslands and the historical landscape. Corr. ID: 3092 Organization: Point Reyes Seashore Ranchers Association Representative Quote: d) Brush management. Bo th native and non-native brush species require management in coastal prairie grasslands. Without brush control, the grasslands will likely become lost to brush invasion. This loss of native habitat due to brush inva sion has already been demonstrated at PRNS in areas where NPS has removed ranching. Coastal prairie grasslands require management. For hundreds of years, or perhaps millennia, humans have facilitated the persistence of this important ecosystem, through fire, grazing and mowing. PRSRA requests that this EA fully evaluate the fact that brush management has occurred on coastal prairies for all recorded history, a fact that has also been identified through anthropological review. This EA should also consider the ecosystem benefit of preserving the grassland habitat by allowing ranc hers to control invasive brush from their pasture lands. PRSRA is committed to work with the agencies to identify the best timing for brush removal to reduce adverse effects to other species. Rangeland ecologists and watershed managers understand that nutrients and sediments are better controlled and better treated by grass covered soil than brush covered soil. The bare soils ofte n found in the shade of the invasive brush allow water to travel more quickly and with less absorption and less plant nutrient uptake. PRSRA requests that the EA study the water quality benefits of allowing ranchers to continue the tradition of brush control as well as the degraded water quality that would result in any prohibition of brush control. Concern ID: 51932 CONCERN Commenters stated that the Ranch CM P should consider restoration of STATEMENT: native plant communities including coas tal prairie.

Areas that should be free of grazing are the 1,192 acre D Ranch which had been abandoned. This acreage has been divided into thirds. One third is in wilderness and the other two thirds are grazed by adjacent ranches. This is an area is especially favored by the elk which come into conflict with the adjacent ranchers who want to graze their stock there. Other areas that should be made a ttractive to the elk due to prairie restoration would be lands around Drakes Head. If these lands were restored as much as possible to its natu ral state, the elk might find this as an alternative to the dairy lands. Dairies have a long history of Johnes disease which is a disease of confinement. Corr.

Benefits expressed by commenters included: maintenance of complex vegetation, the us e of ranching oper ations as a tool for the conservation, and restoratio n of native species. Some impacts described by commenters included: alteration of dominant vegetation species, alteration of the fire regime, increased spread of exotic species, and compaction of soils leading to decrease d infiltration and water availability. Representative Quote(s): Corr.

I met the official botanist and he is doing a valiant job tr ying to fend for the many rare and endangered species and subspecies and their populations here. Corr. ID: 1055 Organization: Western Watersheds Project Representative Quote: There is an extensive literature showing that livestock may increase the risks of hi gh intensity fires by altering the dominance of shrub and forb species, by increasing spread of non-native invasive plants, by compacting soil and reducing moisture content and infiltration, and by increasing the fine fuels that carry fire. Cattle fecal pats readily ignite, are a common source of spot fires, and release extreme Point Reyes National Seashore 135 Ranch CMP September 2014 amounts of energy when burning (Scasta et al., 2013 ). Corr. ID: 3022 Organization: University of California Cooperative Extension Representative Quote: Vegetation. This is a topic that is fundamental to ranching, range management, natural resource management, habitat protection, and fire safety. As describe d in The Changing Role of Agriculture in Point Reyes National Seashore (http://ucanr.org/sites/uccemarin/file s/31000.pdf), ranching at PRNS provides essential ecosystem services, including helping to maintain the complex vegetation mosaic found there, including its open grasslands, inhabited by many endangered plants and animals, while helping to manage fire fuels that would otherwise present a significant wildfire threat to surrounding communities. While past livestock grazing has certainly been a factor in the loss of native plant species on some of Californias grasslands, today it has proven to be an important tool for conserving and restoring native species. Corr. ID: 3049 Organization: Marin Audubon Society Representative Quote: The plan should present a comprehensive analysis of the native species that depend on the park ecosystem for their survival; potential impacts on ranching and im pacts of current ranching operations on those habitats. This is needed to determine whether there could be other management methods that could be more beneficial for coexistence. Included for example should be grassland birds that require low/grazed grasses and vagrants that depend on the vagrant trap trees that exist on some ranchlands. Corr.

Returning rancher stewardship to these coastal prairie lives tock pastures at no cost to PRNS (actually PRNS would collect SUP fees) are likely to further the NPS goal to preserve the coastal pr airie grasslands. PRSRA supports the applications by the historic families in the project area to resume historic grazing operations on these ranch la nds in desperate need of rangeland management. Concern ID: 51935 CONCERN Commenters stated that the Ranch CMP sh ould consider the use of fire as a STATEMENT: management tool for invasive specie s management, brush management, and native vegetation restoration both in ra nchlands and wilderness, and should assess the benefits of fire management to the human environment. Representative Quote(s): Corr. ID: 1032 Representative Quote: Fire regime: The Indians used fire when they struck camp for the season as a way to make Point Reyes National Seashore 136 Ranch CMP September 2014 areas near their village sites attractive to wild animals. Fire management is a way to maintain the grassl ands of the prairie. Corr. ID: 3092 Organization: Point Reyes Seashore Ranchers Association Representative Quote: e) Fire regime. Coastal prairie grasslands require disturbance and invasive species control. Native Americans used fire as a tool to manage the project area be fore European- Americans arrived. The record tells us that the Point Reyes peninsula and surrounding rangelands were covered with lush grasses and full of wildlife - largely due to the regular burning. European-Americans continued to employ fire as a rangeland tool. Most current PRSRA members used fire extensively for brush control on these ranches until the NPS stopped the use of fire. PRSRA believes that fire is an appropriate tool to control brus h in certain circumstances and, because of the risk of wildfires, not in others. The cessation of use of fire and grazing has led to an increase in fire fuel loads, especially in the Olema Valley. Grazing can reduce fire fuel loads in these areas. PRSRA requests that the EA study the benefits of re-introducing grazing to these areas and how this could reduce the risk of catastrophic fires causing harm to the resource, personal property and the potential personal injury or death resulting from avoidable wildfires. PRSRA suggests that in wilderness area s, where almost all native grassland and the species assemblages it supports have been largely lost (especially due to unmanaged brush invasion), fire be considered as a restoration tool. PRSRA asks that this EA also co nsider the benefits to the human environment resulting from fire fuel reduction and minimizing the risk of more PRNS catastrophic wildfires that prescribed burning could provide. This EA should also analyze the increased wildlife carrying capacity, including that of the tule elk, that wo uld result if PRNS began to manage the now threatened coastal prairie grasslands in the wilderness areas. Concern ID: 51936 CONCERN Commenters stated that the Ranch CMP should address the impacts of dune STATEMENT: management to plant and animal specie s and ranching operations, including the removal of non-native vegetation from dunes, the impacts on organic certification resulting from using herbicides on non-native grasses, and how blowing sand from the dunes impacts pastureland. Representative Corr. ID: 28 Quote(s): Representative Quote: -Management of sand dunes and non-native grasses should be addressed - need to keep sa nd from taking over pasture.

Erosion control measures im plemented by PRNS have failed. The Point Reyes National Seashore 137 Ranch CMP September 2014 result was exactly what PRSRA was concerned about. The moving sand covered valuable pasture land, fenc es and endangered plant species, including the endangered grass specie s Sonoma Alopecurus as well as the rare habitat for the Myrtle's Silverspot Butterfly. PRSRA asks that this EA properly consider the dunes as part of the cultural working landscape with non-native plant species. This EA shou ld consider the adverse effects of removing the non-native vege tation from the dunes. Corr. ID: 3092 Organization: Point Reyes Seashore Ranchers Association Representative Quote: b) Dunes. The sand dunes located within the pastoral zone have long played a role in the cultural working landscapes of the Shafter era agriculture through to the present. Thankfully, PRNS has included the dune management in this NEPA process. This process may now work to improve the earlier NEPA process undertaken by PRNS. The working landscapes - ranch CMP EA is the proper context to evaluate the effects of the dune management. The sa nd dunes have always been a threat due to the highly erosive nature of the sand. High winds can easily result in significant sand movement, potentially covering valuable pastureland. Concern ID: 51937 CONCERN Commenters explained that plant species once found in the coastal prairie STATEMENT: have been largely replaced by non-nati ve species over the past 150 years of land use and stated that the Ranch CMP should evaluate the impacts that vegetation restoration would have on ranching operations. Representative Corr. ID: 3092 Organization: Point Reyes Seashore Ranchers Quote(s): Association Representative Quote: Restoration of native prairie. It is widely recognized that most of the native plant specie s once found in the coastal prairie grasslands within the subject area have been replaced by non-native species, either intentionally or accidentally, over the past 150 years of European- American land use. PRSRA believes that true restoration of native coastal prairie is only possible in rare locations within the ranch lands in the subject area. Generations of livestock grazing, exotic seed planting, tilling, crop production, imported feed with exotic plant seeds have all contributed to this shift. These practices, which have changed the landscape and the plant communities beginning 150 years ago, have continued shaping the landscape through the Shafter era and into the present. Corr. ID: 3092 Organization: Point Reyes Seashore Ranchers Association Representative Quote: This EA should study negative effects to the ranchers and their livelih oods if restorat ion of native plant species takes priority over the continuation of the normal ranch practices that have been part of the working landscapes from the Shafter era through the present time. PRSRA is willing to work with rangeland ecologists and certified rangeland managers to locate areas best suited for row crop production, forage crop production, rangeland planting, rangeland mowing to control invasives, waterline placement, water tr ough placement, fence installations and other BMP implementation. PRSRA re cognizes that there are a few rare locations where native vegetation dominat es and areas where special status Point Reyes National Seashore 138 Ranch CMP September 2014 species exist. PRSRA commits to work ing with NPS, NRCS and others to carefully and appropriately manage thes e sensitive areas.

IT1800 - Impact Topic: Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Climate Change Concern ID: 51942 CONCERN Commenters stated that the Ranch CM P should assess impacts of climate STATEMENT: change on ranching operations in the area, including impacts from: changes in weather patterns, extreme weather events, and sea level rise. Representative Quote(s): Corr. ID: 28 Representative Quote: -EA should anticipate climate change/extreme weather events & impact on gr azing/ranching industry. Corr. ID: 964 Representative Quote: Cost of Climate Change The central California coast is susceptible to changes related to climate change and sea level rise. Recent stud ies provide a range of sea level rise along the west coast given current emissions. The rise is projected to be from 1.48 by 2050 to over 5 feet by 2100 [Heberger et al. 2009, Cayan et al. 2009]. At these projected rates, sea-l evel rise could reach approximately 5.9 to 6.6 inches on the high end of the range within the next ten years. Corr. ID: 1055 Organization: Western Watersheds Project Representative Quote: The NEPA documents should provide information about the changes that are likely to occur in the project area due to global climate change over the 20-year period of the proposed permit. In the western United States, both the freque ncy of heavy precipitation events and the frequency of periods of drought have increased over the past century (Christensen et al, Regional Climate Pr ojections, IPCC Fourth Assessment ). While uncertainties remain regarding th e timing and extent of impacts from climate change, modeling indicates that on average, California will likely experience higher temperatures in a ll seasons; longer dry periods; heavy precipitation events; more frequent droughts; and increased wildfire risk. These changes will affect the project area, especially riparian and water resources and the species that depend on them as well as the amount and availability of forage. These effects will obviously be more pronounced over a 20 year versus a 10 year permit period. Global climate change is already impacting the project area. The NPS must evaluate the proposed decision in the context of climate change as both a baseline issue and a cumulative impact to the resources. Concern ID: 51941 CONCERN Commenters stated that ranching operat ions contribute to air pollution, STATEMENT: greenhouse gas emissions, and climate change and that the Ranch CMP Point Reyes National Seashore 139 Ranch CMP September 2014 should describe mitigation measures to address these impacts. Further, the Ranch CMP should discuss compliance with the Clean Air Act and regional Air Quality Management District guid elines, citing ammonia and noxious gas production as air quality concerns. Representative Quote(s): Corr. ID: 792 Representative Quote: Air pollution from cattle farming is also an issue that bears careful evaluation and the development of standards or management practices. Livestock produce significant amounts of greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. much of this is associated with manure management. The CMP process should include a greenhouse gas inventory and careful plans for GHG mitigation. For example, methane gene rated from manure can be used to generate electricity through an anaerobic digestion process. This would not only help air emissions of methane, but also a major solid waste management problem. BMPs can also be used to mitigate other forms of air pollution such a particulate that is emitted by use of equipment during the dry season. Corr. ID: 964 Representative Quote: Livestock are estimated to account for 18% of global anthropogenic emissions which contribute to climate change [Gill et al. 2009]. That is nearly a fifth of the cause of altering the climate on the planet. There is not a shortage of cattle (1.5 billion), and food production is not the purpose nor responsibility of national park lands. Rather the purpose of a national park is to lessen or preferably remove anthropogenic impacts on the landscape to the best of its ability. Corr. ID: 1036 Representative Quote: The President has stated that combating climate change is a priority. Animal agriculture(specifically cattle ranching) contributes the most significant amount of greenhouse gases world wide. As a National Park, it would be out of line with these values to allow the cattle ranching to take place. Corr.

At other times, it is strikingly obvious, as with vegetation, either in cyclical changes of growth and reproduction or the progressive changes of plant competition and succession. This dynamic quality of all cultural landscapes is balanced by the continuity of distinctive characteristics retained over time.

Corr. ID: 3082 Organization: R & J McClelland Dairy Representative Quote: Over the past five years California has lost 356 dairies due to a severe downturn in the dairy economy. These dairies either relocated out of state or completely went out of business altogether. This is a growing trend in California due to an unstable conventional dairy market and the high cost of doing business in the state. Why is it devastating for our state to loose even one da iry? Dairies are a vital part of our economy and provide stability in our communities. For every four dairy cows, one job is created. Not only on farm jobs but it creates jobs within the entire community infrastructure. Supply companies, veterinarians, dairy processing plants, distributors, milk truck drivers, feed farmers, retailers, feed supply companies all depend on a thriving dairy industry. Marin and Sonoma Counties have a long standing tradition of being intertwined agriculturally speaking. There are now roughly 85 dairies left in the two counties. Over time, various support industries have developed in order to serve these dairies. These business es depend on a stable ranching environment. The loss of even one farm can have a devastating effect on the entire Marin/Sonoma infrastructure. We all depend on each other to stay viable in order to keep these support systems in place. Other business indirectly benefit from having fa rming in their community as well. Restaurants, doctor's offices, banks, retail stores all serv ice farmers and the families they employ.

Changes in stimuli and disturbance can lead to increase d anxiety and, in some instances, aggression in domestic livestock. This EA should also evaluate the benefits of NPS providing indemnification to the ranchers in case of injury to members of the public caused by livestock. PRSRA believes that this would be fair because it is NPS that is encouraging public access through ranchers livestock, not the ranchers.

As they make their way out to the various points of interest in the Seashore, they have the opportunity to pass by these historic farms and ranches. A huge portion of the American population is not involved in farming and has not been for generations. A trip out to PRNS not only gives them the chance to see a historic way of life , they also get to see firsthand where their food comes from.

It is truly exciting for families and children to experience a visit to the working landscape, see the farm and have the opportunity to purchase the farm product at its source. This EA should evaluate the benefits of on-farm product purchasing opportunities for the visiting public. These opportunities provide the following to the visiting public: education, recreation and a connection to a hist oric, yet fully active food producing region. All the while, these opportunities also help the ranchers and farmers connect with the public that appreciates their work and provides additional farm income. Corr.

Overnight stays on other working ranches within the project ar ea would offer more recreational opportunities for visiting families in terested in experiencing the working landscape culture with the families that have been a part of the landscape and history for generations. This EA should evaluate the public benefit of the ranchers offering daytime farm work experiences and overnight on- farm accommodations as well as the be nefit to the ranching family by allowing additional farm income. Corr. ID: 3092 Organization: Point Reyes Seashore Ranchers Association Representative Quote: Today, the oyster farm is the only member of PRSRA organized and permitted to offer regular farm tours. The oyster farm does not currently charge any fee for the tours. This EA should consider the effects on the human environment of allowing other ranches and farms to provide farm tours if requested. If NPS would allow other ranchers and farmers to offer tours at a fee, the publ ic would benefit from the recreational value and the rancher would benefit from the income generated.

Representative Corr. ID: 3092 Organization: Point Reyes Seashore Ranchers Quote(s): Association Representative Quote: 5) Health and Safety - Standards for operator and worker housing. PRSRA is puzzled by this section that PR NS has identified as an issue to be included in the Ranch CMP EA. The worker housing on the ranches and farms have health and safety standards that must be followed. PRNS and the United States Public Health Department (USPH), on an annual ba sis, inspect all worker housing on every historic ranch or farm located within the working landscapes of GGNRA and PRNS. PRNS and USPH then provide inspection reports to the ranchers and farmers that provid e and maintain the housing. If the agencies find any health or safety non-compliance, they require the rancher or farmer to correct the deficiency. Th is regulatory oversight seems to be appropriate in assuring health and safety standards are met for worker housing. PRSRA is concerned that because PRNS listed worker housing health and safety as an issue, the public perception may be that there is a problem with health and safety of the workers housin g on the ranches or that the changes contemplated by this EA may result in adverse effects to worker housing health and safety. PRSRA does not believe a public proces s is necessary to ensure that the existing health and safety standards be applied to new housing. It seems self-evident that the existing standards and inspection protocols would apply. IT2500 - Impact Topic: Wilderness Concern ID: 51963 CONCERN One commenter stated that the Wilder ness Act allows for certain domestic STATEMENT: livestock grazing operations to continue in areas that were established prior to designation of those areas as wilderness as long as operations are consistent with the preservation of the wilderness character. The commenter noted that grazing in wilderness has been set aside by court rulings in the past where agencies have failed to a ddress impacts to wilderness conditions. Representative Quote(s): Corr. ID: 1055 Organization: Western Watersheds Project Representative Quote: Section 4(d)(4)(2) of the Wilderness Act allows certain domestic livestock grazing operations to continue where established prior to wilderness designation. However, any allowed grazing is subject to reasonable regulations and must overa ll be consistent with preserving and Point Reyes National Seashore 150 Ranch CMP September 2014 restoring the wilderness character. The Act requires the NPS to administer wilderness to retain its prim eval character and influence. Wilderness character is a valuable resource and important use of Park lannds. Values associated with wilderness character that should be analyzed include: naturalness and opportunities for solitude; scenic values; primitive recreation value, such as hiking, ca mping, hunting and wildlife viewing; plant and wildlife habitat values - due to their unspoiled state, lands with wilderness characteristics provide valuab le habitat for wildlife, biodiversity, watershed protection and overall healthy ecosystems; cultural resource values - the lack of intensive human access and activity on lands with wilderness characteristics helps to protect these resources; and economic and quality of life values - recreation opportunities provided by wilderness quality lands also yield direct economic benefits to local communities and help define the character of the region. Recent court rulings have set aside grazing decisions based on environmental analyses where agencie s failed to address whether the wilderness values as they existed at the time the area was set aside for wilderness could be impaired by the agency's decision to allow grazing, and the cumulative effects of such decisi ons and other grazing permitted across a wilderness study area. cf.

Commenters also question ed how much management of the tule elk population would be needed (monitoring, fencing, etc.) in the absence of agricultural activities, and suggested the Ranch CMP should describe the cost incurred by the NPS to perform oversight and supervision of ranching operations and management of tule elk on ranchlands and in the pastoral zone.

The frequent trapping and testing of elk is an unnecessary interference with them and unnecessary use of park personnel. What has been the total cost to the NP S to administer, manage the Pastoral Zone since its inception, in addition to the initial buyout costs? The extensive costs of the Pastoral Zone ranching point to the incompatibility of livestock operations with the pres ervation of native ecosystems. Corr.

Reporting on a recent forum, The Point Reyes Light wrote, \"The park has responded to some of the problems by repairing fences themselves, offering ranchers supplies to fix them, hazing the elk off and filling up nearby ponds to try to lure them off working pastures.\" But the only way that ranchers can be viable is to remove the elk from their original range.

The time needed to manage a large native ungulate (elk) to satisfy the li vestock operators, as in the current proposal, is substantial. The following are examples from recent management reports on the PRNS websit e: The park wildlife technician has been dedicated to monitoring tule elk nearly full time since fall 2010, with more than 640 surveys to document elk behavior and use of lands within the pastoral zone. In August 2013 two 5000 gallon tanks and 3000 ft. of pipe were installed outside the leased area to maintain water for elk. Elk are hazed off the leased properties by PR NS personnel.

IT2700 - Impact Topic: Other/New Impact Topics Concern ID: 51967 CONCERN Commenters noted that not all lands in the pastoral zone are capable of STATEMENT: sustaining livestock and stated that the park must determine the current carrying capacity of these lands for grazing. One commenter noted that, without this evaluation, and the decisi on that non-native cattle belong here, the park cannot make an appropriate assessment as to whether grazing is an appropriate land use in this area. Representative Quote(s): Corr. ID: 1015 Organization: Tule Elk foundation Representative Quote: There needs to be a open and scientific-based discussion of the real impacts of non-native European dairy/cattle operations (as well as the exotic specie s associated with cattle) on these public lands and within a National Park. That should be the central discussion -not \"establishing long-t erm management approaches ID: 1055 Organization: Western Watersheds Project Representative Quote: One of the Management Objectives of the 1980 General Management Plan (\"GMP\") is to \"manage seashore activities in the pastoral and estuarine areas in a manner compatible with resource carrying capacity.\" GMP at 2. Clearly not all lands within the pastoral zone are suitable for livestock grazing; for example, exclosures have had to be installed to protect some natural and cultural resources from the direct effects of livestock. Additionally, many areas within the pastoral zone are not actually capable of supporting livestock at all on a sustained basis. This is quite clear even to the casual visitor driving through the Park; bare slopes, gullies and soil erosion are evident from the road th rough the pastoral zone. The Park must determine the current ca rrying capacity and suitability of the lands in the pastoral zone for graz ing by livestock, co nsider how these factors have changed since the 1980 GMP was produced, and analyze how these factors are expected to change o ver the next 20 years. Without this fundamental baseline data, the Park will not be able to determine if it can meet the GMP objective with continued livestock grazing and thus will not be able authorize any continued livestock grazing. Development of a comprehensive management plan for livestock grazing would thus be unnecessary. The NPS must also consider resource carrying capacity across the entire Park not just in the pastoral zone. Ba sed on newspaper reports, in contrast Point Reyes National Seashore 154 Ranch CMP September 2014 to the portrayal in the scoping letter, Point Reyes ranchers do not share the NPS interests in protecting important park resources such as Tule elk at all. The Park needs to recognize that the commercial interests of already heavily-subsidize public lands ranchers are outside its concern. However, when those commercial operations interfere with the protection of important resources such as Tule elk, the Park's clear responsibility is with resource protection. The Park needs to consider the extent to which the pastoral zone will need to be decrea sed to assure that sufficient resources exist for the target population of Tule elk across the Park. Concern ID: 52171 CONCERN One commenter expressed concern over the possibility of elk leaving the STATEMENT: park, which would result in added pressure on the state fish and wildlife agency. The commenter indicated that the Ranch CMP should plan for this potential outcome. Additionally, this commenter would like data shared pertaining to the movement of the elk herds. Representative Quote(s): Corr. ID: 2986 Organization: Marin Humane Society Representative Quote: The two free-roaming he rds of elk outside the fenced area are of great concern to our agency. If they leave the jurisdiction of the Park they become the responsibility of our state Fish and Wildlife agency which is already overwhelmed with tough issues. Our agency would also be potentially impacted as we curre ntly respond to all calls for sick and injured wildlife throughout Marin. Our officers would need additional training and improved equipment to respond to elk calls outside of the Park. We believe it is important to plan for th e potential of the elk leaving the area if they are going to continue to multip ly at the level reported. Sharing this data and their travel patterns will help us proactively prepare to respond when the elk leave the park. ON1000 - Other NEPA Issues: General Comments Concern ID: 51968 CONCERN Commenters suggested that a full En vironmental Impact Statement should STATEMENT: be completed.

Point Reyes National Seashore 155 Ranch CMP September 2014 Corr. ID: 1055 Organization: Western Watersheds Project Representative Quote: Western Watersheds Project strongly urges the NPS to take a second look at its scoping letter for this grazing plan. The general impression we received from re ading your scoping letter is that the Park has already predetermined what it is going to do and is simply embarking on a NEPA process that will rubber stamp its pre-decision in clear violation of the law. The scoping letter itself reads as though it was written for the Park by a pro-ranching interest group. Western Watersheds Project fully expects that the NPS will need to complete a full Environmental Impact Statement for this highly controversial grazing plan. Concern ID: 51969 CONCERN One commenter suggested that the NPS should improve its method for STATEMENT: accepting public comments, particularly the NPS should allow comments that are emailed, and that the PEPC webpage should be able to accept formatted comments and attachments.

For reas ons that were not explained in the scoping notice, the Park will not accept emailed comments. The Park has provided a limited electronic portal but that will not accept formatted comments or attachments. This makes it difficult for the public to provide copies of scientific papers and reports that will be useful to the Park Service in this analysis. This limiting of the ab ility of the public to provide input into a project that will impact one of their National Parks is something the Park Service should be deprecating not adopting.

Therefore, th e Park must evaluate the compatibility of each alternative with all the applicable controlling agreements and plans. Point Reyes National Seashore 156 Ranch CMP September 2014 The Park is required to ensure that the proposed action is based on best available science and that it complies with the Point Reyes National Seashore Establishment Act Public La w 87-657, the Park Service Organic Act, the National Historic Preservation Act (\"NHPA\"), 16 U.S.C. 470 et seq. 1980 General Management Plan, th e NEPA, the Clean Water Act, the Endangered Species Act, and other state and federal laws concerning public lands and public resources. The Park is also required to ensure full consideration of all connected actions in the same NEPA process. Connected actions are those that are \"closely related\" to the proposal an d alternatives. In this case, if the proposed action authorizes livestock grazing this will directly impact the management of Tule elk and other si gnificant Park resources. The Park cannot simply aver that the management of these other resources is outside the scope of the project planning process. Similarly, the Park must consider all livestock grazing-related infrastructure as part of this process. It cannot make a decision to graze separate from any new fencing or new water developments etc. are needed to support that activity since those developments would have no independent utility. Concern ID: 51971 CONCERN One commenter suggested that the pr oposed project does not require the STATEMENT: NPS to proceed with an EA to comply with NEPA to modify the duration of the leases, because NPS NEPA regulations include a categorical exclusion from further NEPA review for renewals of permits that do not entail new construction or any potential for new environmental impact. Representative Quote(s): Corr. ID: 3032 Organization: California NPS contends that this CMP/EA is necessary in order to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). However, NEPA does not require NPS to undergo such a process given the limited purpose outlined by NPS and given the current realities of the PRNS. The purpose identified by NPS in its April 21 notice appears to be limited to the administration of long-term leases for up to 20 years. This purpose, however, is exempt from NEPA, and thus is not required to undergo the EA process. NPS Directors' Order 12 renewals . . . [of] permits that do not entail new construction or any potential for new environmental im pact\" are excluded from NEPA's requirements. The purpose identified by NPS for PRNS appears to be limited precisely to these circumstances: the renewals of existing permits or the re-issuance of expired permits. NPS's own actions over the years suggests an implicit understanding that no formal EA is required in such circumstances, as NPS has long issued and renewed permits to ranchers at PRNS-including 20 year permits-without undergoing any formal EA process. Even if NPS seek s to change the durations of these leases, or to make them uniform in duration throug hout Point Reyes, such permitting and leasing is still exempt from NEPA. Point Reyes National Seashore 157 Ranch CMP September 2014 Nor is it clear from looking beyond the \"Draft Project Purpose\" (which is where one would logically expect to s ee the action or proposal necessitating the CMP/EA) what might require NPS to institute this CMP/EA under NEPA. Under \"Draft Project Need,\" th e only element addressed which is not directly alluded to under the \"Draft Project Purpose\" is the need to \"address concerns related to tule elk impacts to existing ranch operations.\" While we certainly agree with NPS that there is a need to address this significant impact to ranching, it does not appear that NEPA mandates an EA process to address th is issue, either. In 19 98, NPS conducted a NEPA process which authorized the relocation of elk to Limantour and rejected an alternative which would have permitted elk in the pastoral zone. The 1998 Management Plan provides NPS with the legal auth ority to remove the elk from the pastoral zone immediately-no additional time or cost is required, as the NEPA process has already been undertaken. Concern ID: 52233 CONCERN Commenters state that the 1998 Elk Ma nagement Plan provides the needed STATEMENT: guidance to address the current presence of elk in the pastoral zone, that a new NEPA analysis is unnecessary to address the issue, and that the NPS should apply the alternative adopted in the 1998 Elk Management Plan. Representative Quote(s): Corr. ID: 3032 Organization: California Cattlem If NPS's proposal for the CMP/EA is limited to administration of long-term leases/permits and tule elk management, then NPS need not undergo the lengthy and costly EA process, as NEPA does not require it in these circumstances. In the alternative, if NPS's proposal is in fact broader than these goals, then NPS ought to clarify this project purpose and re-initiate the scoping process such that the purposes are clearly disclosed to the public, permitting more efficient and effective public comment. Corr. ID: 3074 Organization: Sonoma State University Representative Quote: Furthermore, the envi ronmental impacts of returning the elk to the designated wi lderness area had al ready been studied in the 1998 Tule Elk Management Plan. The elk range identified in the Plan is restricted to the wilderness area around and south of Limantour, not extending into the Pastoral Zone. The question for NEPA is whether or not environmental impacts have been analyz ed, not about whether property is public or private. Any possible impact s of relocating elk that have wandered out of the elk range back to where th ey belong have alre ady been analyzed (in the context of \"neighboring\" private property), and the resulting document was a Finding of No Significant Impact. Hence there should be no need for additional pl anning or NEPA review for returning the elk to their originally intended range in the wilderness area near Limantour, as such actions have already been determin ed to cause no significant impacts. This action should be implemented immediately.

One commenter stated that agricultural leases held by individuals who have no direct bloodline to the original owners should be terminated immediately. Representative Quote(s): Corr. ID: 1010 Representative Quote: Ranching and dairying are only allowable where deemed \"appropriate\" in the \"discretion\" of the Secretary. In making that discretionary decision the Secretary mu st determine that such use will not impair the park's \"natural values.\" Furt her, such use is subject to \"restrictive covenants\" necessary to carry out the \"purposes\" of the park's statue. One purpose is that, like the tr aditional uses of recreation, education and historic preservation, ranching has to be conduc ted in such a way as to not conflict with the highest priority which is the \"maximum protection ... of the natural environment\" of the park. Wildlife is part of the natural environment of the park. Conserving wildlife is also a \"fundamental purpose\" of the national parks. Thus, to the extent some ranchers speak of the grass and water on the ranches as \"theirs,\" as if they own the grass and water, they don't. In fact, they can ranch only to the extent it doesn't harm the park's resources. This is a national park, not a national ranch. Corr. ID: 1010 Representative Quote: Given the legal framework above, the Park Service has to make a determination, in its discretion, as to whether grazing is \"appropriate.\" This must be done as to each ranch. The Park Service then Point Reyes National Seashore 161 Ranch CMP September 2014 has to determine the extent of graz ing (where appropriate) and what conditions or restrictions are necessary. To those ends the Park Service should consider the following: Carrying capacity. The Park Service should discuss how much forage there is as a first step in authoring grazing on each ranch. Allocation of forage. The Park Service should discuss how the amount of forage on each ranch should be used , keeping in mind the Park Service's obligations to protect and preserve the natural resources of the park, including wildlife. Fencing. Fencing is necessary to contain cattle (assuming there will be no \"open range\"), but it is harmful to wild animals because it restricts their natural movements to varying degrees an d occasionally injures or kills them. However, there are fencing methods that are adequate for restricting cattle that are \"wildlife friendly.\" Corr. ID: 1022 Organization: In Defense of Quote: The PRNS enabling legislat ion, Sec. 459c-5 statue states that the owner retain for himself and his or her heirs and assigns a right of use and occupancy for a definite term of not more than twenty-five years, or, in lieu thereof, for a term ending at the death of the owner or the death of his or her spouse, whichever is later. While the question remains whether or not the NPS has upheld the enforcement of its own legislation of PRNS in this regard, leases held by individuals who have no direct bloodline to the original owners, should be terminated immediately. Corr. ID: 1038 Organization: the Wildlife Trust Representative Quote: Legal issues concerning commercial grazing leases/permits within PRNS: The purpose of the U.S. National Park System under law: \"In national parks, the supreme law of the land is the 1916 Organic Act that identifies a single priority holding sw ay above all other factors: Conserving park wonders unimpaired by harm caused by incompatible uses. Upheld by later court rulings, the Organic Act is cr ystal clear: the NPS's first obligation is to resource protection, and commercial or recreational uses may be precluded if they impair park resour ces or values., - Robert B. Keiter; natural resource legal scholar, attorn ey, founding director of the Walace Stegner Center for Land, Resources an d the Environment at the University of Utah's Quinney Law School, eminent American authority on national park policy. - Nowhere is it stated that there is an inherent right of individuals or corporations to secure permanent or long-term use, favors or benefits within the National Park Service syst em units. After the National Park Service bought all the private inholdings within the designated boundary of PRNS, agreements between the former land owners and the NPS allowed Point Reyes National Seashore 162 Ranch CMP September 2014 for the temporary leasing/permitting of certain pastoral lands within PRSN for livestock grazing and dairy operations. Concern ID: 51978 CONCERN One commenter suggested that the park should be referred to as a National STATEMENT: Seashore in all publications an d communications with the public. Representative Corr. ID: 3076 Organization: Point Reyes Seashore Ranchers Quote(s): Association Representative Quote: PRNS is a unit of the national park system and PRNS is a National Seashore, not a National Park. PRSRA asks that all EA documents, publications and communications be corrected. Currently, there are many references to park or park resources. These should be changed to seashore or seashore reso urces. This error, if not corrected, could cause the public and consultants to apply the wrong standards to this environmental review. PN8000 - Purpose and Need: Ob jectives In Taking Action Concern ID: 51979 CONCERN STATEMENT: Commenters suggested that the Ranch CMP should educate the public about the compatibility of farming and nature by highlighting farm sustainability, marketing, and loca l production and consumption of the regional agricultural products. Ot her commenters suggested that an objective of the Ranch CMP should be to ensure that the ranches continue to be economically viable, and to miti gate adverse impacts from Tule elk on ranches. Representative Quote(s): Other specific objectives suggested by commenters included: favoring native annual wildflowers and perennial gras ses, developing unique gastronomic resources, encouraging sustainable agricultural practices, providing a framework for cooperation between hikers and ranchers, and allowing current practices to continue whil e allowing for diversification. Corr. ID: 1009 Organization: Marin County Agricultural Commissioner Representative Quote: The Point Reyes Nation al Seashore should acknowledge ranchers for their land management and stewardship. This productivity coupled with the high biodiversity, ecological quilt, edge effect of multiple habitats, and topography gives exceptional resiliency for both agriculture and natural systems to flourish. This Environmental Assessment should merge farm sustainability, marketing, and local production and consumption for the regional agricultural products and to educate the public about the compatibility of farming and nature. Corr. ID: 2982 Representative Quote: The following issues and goals should be among those considered in elaborating th e Ranch Comprehensive Management Plan and Environmental Assessment: - Favoring native annual wild flowers and perennial grasses Point Reyes National Seashore 163 Ranch CMP September 2014 - Developing unique gastronomic resources - Encouraging sustainable agricultural practices - Providing a framework for cooperation between hikers and ranchers Corr. ID: 3076 Organization: Point Reyes Seashore Ranchers Association Representative Quote: The plan objective: Identi fy and evaluate activities that provide operational flexibility to support long-term dairy and beef cattle operations in a manner consis tent with the protection of park resources should be amended. This narrow view of only providing operational flexibility to a dairy and beef ranching monoculture misses the true objective of supporting, encouraging and celebrating the truly diversified and dynamic Shafter era agri culture. PRSRA suggests that this objective should be re-written as: Id entify and evaluate activities that provide operational flexibility to support the dairy and beef cattle operations as well as the diversified agri cultural activities that were present during the Shafter era in a manner co nsistent with the protection of seashore resources and World Heritage Site management principles that recognize 'continuing landscapes. NEPA requires an agency to review th e effects of its federal action on the whole human environment, not just th e effects its action may have on the natural environment. The viability of the ranchers is part of the human environment that this CMP must consider. PRSRA suggests another plan objective: To create a plan that will allow current practices to continue, allow for long term leases/permits, al low for the addition of new practices consistent with Shafter era agriculture and to ensure ranchers financial viability in a manner consistent with th e protection of seashore resources. Concern ID: 51980 CONCERN Commenters suggested that the Ranch CMP objectives lack specificity, STATEMENT: stating specific information that needs clarification, including: additional details regarding any anticipated actions of the Ranch CMP. Representative Quote(s): Corr. ID: 1055 Organization: Western Watersheds Project Representative Quote: The ongoing restoration of the Point Reyes National Seashore Tule elk population is \"a jewel in the crown\" of NPS success stories. Yet, despite the nati onal significance of the Tule elk restoration the NPS scoping letter states as an objective of the Ranch CMP: \"Establish long-term management approach for tule elk affecting agricultural lease/permit areas.\" That is an outrageous proposal. The National Park Service's mission is to \"to conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and the wild life therein and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations.\" 16 U.S. Code \u00a7 1. The National Park Service's mission is not to promote the commercial/business interests of a handful of wealthy, privat e entities at the expense of treasured public resources. There is an extensive pertinent literature showing that the presence of cattle alters the behavior of large ungulates including deer and elk, and that cattle Point Reyes National Seashore 164 Ranch CMP September 2014 compete with them for vari ous resources (Kie et al., 1991 ; Loft et al., 1991 ; Stewart et al., 2002 ). The restored Point Reyes tule elk herd did not grow following initial translocation until after the removal of cattle from its habitat in 1980, whence the tule elk population began to dramatically increase (Gogan and Barrett, 1987 ). The Park needs to incorporate objectives to promote protection for the tule elk and to promote its full recovery as an essential component of the ecosystem of the pastoral zone that has been so devastated by commercial cattle operations. Corr. ID: 2996 Organization: San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Water Board Representative Quote: The Project Objectives requ ire more specificity. For example: The statement to \"identify and evaluate activities that provide operational flexibility to support long-term operations in a manner consistent with protection of park resources,\" is unclear to us and therefore, we request that more clarity and spec ificity of any anticipated actions be included in the objectives and discussed more fully. Concern ID: 51981 CONCERN Commenters suggested that the Ranch CMP include additi onal objectives, STATEMENT: including: to assess whether confined animal facilities and other rangeland operations are operating in complian ce with current federal and state regulations; to address carbon sequestration; to discontinue European cattle operations in the park; to protect Tule elk; to clarify NPS expectations and rancher commitments; and to restore agricultural activities in the Olema Valley and Point Reyes Historic Ranch Districts where they historically existed. Representative Quote(s): Corr. ID: 30 Representative Quote: -Bring carbon sequestratio n into the goals. Native grasses are especially effective. Corr. ID: 1015 Organization: Tule Elk foundation Representative Quote: We believe the discussion should be re-worded o the following as a part of a 2014- 2015 mission and vision for our National Parks: Establishing short and long-term management approaches (including a tentative phase-out plan) for nonnative European cattle and the related operations that occur as a result extend ing the agricultural lease/permits on pastoral lands. Corr. ID: 2996 Organization: San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Water Board Representative Quote: We request that you include an objective explicit to environmental compliance. Specifically , an objective to assess whether confined animal facilities and other rangeland operations are operating in compliance with current federal and State regulations, including but not limited to Waste Discharge Requirements (WDRs) and/or Waivers of WDRs issued by the Water Board for co nfined animal facilities and grazing operations that operate on NPS lands subject to the RCMP. We would like Point Reyes National Seashore 165 Ranch CMP September 2014 to see specific details developed in th e Final NEPA document that address rangeland assessment and facility in spections, compliance monitoring, record-keeping, implementation of management practices, reporting, and, if necessary, enforcement. The Final NE PA document should also discuss NPS enforcement of State and federal regulations. Corr. ID: 3076 Organization: Point Reyes Seashore Ranchers Association Representative Quote: Certain seashore ranch lands have recently been taken out of agricultural production, completely changing the land use and its intensity of use, without any enviro nmental review or public process. In some cases, historic families have been displaced. PRSRA asks that one more plan objective be added: Restor e agricultural activities in the Olema Valley and Point Reyes Historic Ranch Districts where they historically existed and are not otherwise prohibited by law or are no longer agriculturally viable in areas where gras slands were replaced by dense brush or forest long ago. This EA should consider the benefits of having PRSRA members- - -familiar with these rang elands- - -involved in the decision- making about which areas are agriculturally viable and which are not. Corr. ID: 3076 Organization: Point Reyes Seashore Ranchers Association Representative Quote: The plan objective: Clarify NPS expectations and rancher commitments to ensure consis tency of agricultural lease/permits should be amended. PRSRA believes a more collaborative approach to ensure consistency would improve this objective. PRSRA suggests changing this objective to: Clarify NPS and Ra nchers expectations and commitments to ensure consistency of agricultural lease/permits. Concern ID: 51982 CONCERN One commenter stated that materials pr epared to educate the public on the STATEMENT: Ranch CMP prior to commenting were mi sleading in that they imply that the park already has a plan objective to keep the elk in the pastoral zone. Representative Corr. ID: 3076 Organization: Point Reyes Seashore Ranchers Quote(s): Association Representative Quote: PRSRA objects to the section entitled Management of Tule Elk on Ranchlands found in the materials describing the current ranch CMP EA. These materials were prep ared by PRNS with the intent to educate the public of the elk issue an d to encourage public comment. This PRNS description of the issue implies that PRNS has a plan objective of keeping tule elk on the ranchlands and ma naging them there. It appears as if PRNS is soliciting public comments about managing elk on the ranchlands. PRSRA opposes this language and suggest s that this sentence be changed to the more accurate and legally correct requirement to which PRNS must comply: Update the 1998 Environmental Assessment and Elk Management Plan. Unfortunately, damage has already been done by suggesting to the public, during this important comment period, that the new existence of the invasive tule elk on to the pastoral zone is a done deal. The PRNS, its contractors and its experts must consider the fact that the public was given this misleading statemen t prior to commenting. Point Reyes National Seashore 166 Ranch CMP September 2014 PO1000 - Park Operations: Guiding Policies, Regs and Laws Concern ID: 51984 CONCERN One commenter requested that the park make available the original transfer STATEMENT: documents for grazing properties in the park.

Agricultural products, practices, and buildings in the Seashore have changed substantially over 160 years though the character of the Historic District s has remained substantially intact. These kinds of changes may continue to occur but the cultural landscape can still exhibit continuity of form, orde r, use, features, or materials. This section of the CMP-EA could borrow heavily from the Introduction in The Secretary of the Interior's( Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties with (Guidelines for the Tr eatment of Cultural California Cooperative Extension Representative Quote: Farm diversification has been a central tenet of Marin County farmers ability to surv ive in times when market forces, increasing regulation and more attr active careers threaten to lure young farmers and ranchers away from ou r many multi-generational farms. Diversification has saved numerous Marin family farms over the past decade as the younger generation chooses to creatively produce new products and find new markets to keep 4th, 5th, and 6th generation farms viable. University of California Cooperative Extension (UCCE), the University of California Small Farm Program, and many other organizations, have been at the forefront of farm and ranch diversi fication for over a decade, providing tools and information that agricultural fa milies need to remain viable in California Cooperative Extension Representative Quote: Ample information on many of the topics addressed in the scoping documents exists within other agencies. Rather than creating Point Reyes National Seashore 168 Ranch CMP September 2014 redundant policies and recommendatio ns, we suggest that PRNS and its consultants familiarize th emselves with the extensive body of work on natural resource and agricultural pla nning and management that already exists for Marin County and California. Diversification. Agriculture is define d in the Marin County Development Code (https://library.municode.com/index.aspx?clientId=16476&stateId=5&state Name=California) as: Agriculture (land use). The breeding, raising, pasturing, and grazing of livestock, for the production of food and fiber; the breeding and raising of bees, fish, poultry, and other fowl; and the planting, raising, harvesting and producing of agricultural, aquacultural , horticultural and forestry crops. Corr. ID: 3022 Organization: University of California Cooperative Extension Representative Quote: Marin Countywide Plan policies and programs also support agricultural diversification: Policy AG-2.3 Support Small-Scale Diversification. Diversify agricultural uses and products on a small percentage of agricultural lands to complement existing traditional uses, ensure the continued economic viability of the county agricultural industry, and provide increased food security. Program AG-2.b Support Sustainable Agriculture. Work with University of California Cooperative Extension (F arm Advisor) and Marin County Agricultural Commissioners staff to assist producers with development, diversification, and marketing of Marins sustainable agricultural products. By definition, Marin County agricultur e is diverse. One of the primary ways that PRNS and other Marin County ra nching families have been able to remain economically viable and continue ranching operations generation after generation is by diversifying the types of crops they produce and, in many cases, processing those crops into value added products. Sustainable agriculture relies not only on productive soils and adequate water, but also on each farm familys abil ity to live on their land and diversify their farming operations as changing times require. Corr. ID: 3036 Representative Quote: Sources for Policies: The May 21, 2014 letter from the University of California Agricult ural and Natural Resources Cooperative Extension, Marin County, provides li nks to information on many of the topics identified in the scoping anno uncement. The standards and policies set out in these links are the foundation for agricultural practices in Marin County generally. We join in urging NPS planners to become familiar with these standards and policies and be gu ided by them in developing the ranch management plan.

Public scoping is the rst step to involve the public in the NEPA process. Scoping includes holding meetings, providing information, and asking the public for their comments so that their concerns are identi ed early and the analysis is focused on important issues. The NPS encourages comments on the draft purpose and need, and requests that the public identify topics and concerns that should be addressed in the Ranch CMP . Commenters are also encouraged to bring forward any new information the NPS may not be aware of that would be of use in preparing the Ranch CMP . Background In his November 29, 2012 memorandum, the Secretary of the Interior observed that ranching operations \"have a long and important history on the Point Reyes peninsula\" and directed the NPS director \"to pursue extending permits for the ranchers within those pastoral lands to 20-year terms. \" Broad planning with regard to management of lands under agricultural lease/permits has not been conducted since the 1980 General Management Plan. A comprehensive planning and compliance process is needed to evaluate reasonably foreseeable dairy and range management practices as well as park management actions on these lands over the next 20 years. The NEPA process will evaluate potential activities that may be authorized through the lease/permit program to ensure they are consistent with the protection of park resources. The plan will also consider park management actions that address wildlife, vegetation, and other resource issues speci c to lands operated under agricultural leases/permits. Ranchers and the public have raised concerns related to tule elk and their impact on current ranch operations. Management strategies included in the Ranch CMP would augment tule elk management actions in other parts of the park not addressed in the 1998 T ule Elk Management Plan/EA. The planning process involves more than 28,000 acres of land and 24 ranching families. Each of these operations is unique and collectively represents a wide range of approaches, from traditional commodity production to organic and niche production. Photo Credit: Bruce Farnsworth 1 Purpose and Need for Action WHAT IS THE PURPOSE? The purpose of this plan is to establish a comprehensive framework for the management of existing ranch lands administered by Point Reyes National Seashore under agricultural lease/special use permits (lease/permits), with terms up to 20 years. WHAT IS THE NEED? Ranching has a long and important history on the Point Reyes peninsula and adjacent National Park Service lands. These working ranches are a vibrant part of Point Reyes National Seashore and represent an important contribution to the superlative natural and cultural resources of these NPS lands. Protection of these diverse and unique resources is an important responsibility shared by the NPS and park ranchers within the agricultural lease/permit areas. On November 29, 2012, the Secretary of the Interior issued a memorandum authorizing the NPS to pursue long-term lease/permits for dairy and beef ranching operations. The Secretary's memorandum demonstrates the support of the NPS and the Department of the Interior for the continued presence of dairy and beef ranching operations within these NPS lands. A comprehensive management plan is needed: T o articulate a clear vision for ranching on existing ranch lands administered by Point Reyes National Seashore. T o implement the Secretary of the Interior's direction to pursue issuance of lease/permits with terms up to 20 years. T o address concerns related to tule elk impacts to existing ranch operations. T o provide clear guidance and streamline processes for park and regulatory review of proposed ranching activities, including best management practices that promote protection of park resources. 2 Plan Objectives Objectives are what must be achieved to a large degree NATURAL AND CULTURAL for the action to be con sider ed a success. All of the RESOURCE MANAGEMENT alternatives selected for detailed analysis must meet the project objectives to a large degree and resolve the purpose of and need for action. Consistent with NPS policies, the protection of park resources and the Secretary's Memorandum of November 29, 2012, the objectives of this planning process are to: RANGE MANAGEMENT AND OPERATIONS Clarify NPS expectations and rancher commitments to ensure consistency of agricultural lease/permits; Identify and evaluate activities that provide operational fl exibility to support long-term dairy and beef cattle operations in a manner consistent with the protection of park resources; Dene best management practices to promote protection of park resources and streamline park and regulatory review and approvals of proposed ranching activities; Promote the health and safety of agricultural work ers on ranch lands; Dene a process for maintaining ranching if a ranch operator chooses not to continue operations; Support sustainable operational practices such as maintaining organic certi cation, promoting increased energy e ciency, and working towards carbon neutral operations; and Review and update permit structure to refl ect decisions made through this plan. VISITOR EXPERIENCE Coordinate and promote interpretation and education opportunities for visitors and the public to learn about historic and contemporary ranching operations; and Address visitor access and recreational opportunities on ranch lands to protect the interests of park and ranch facilities, while ensuring protection of ranch operations and their privacy . Establish long-term management approach for tule elk aecting agricultural lease/permit areas; Evaluate management approaches that improve maintenance of ranch operations and protect native wildlife and vegetation populations; identify collaborative management opportunities that promote protection of sensitive and rare cultural and natural resources through adaptation of ranch management activities; Identify management and maintenance strategies for protecting historic ranch structures leased as part of park agricultural lease/permits and archeological sites; and Identify collaborative management opportunities that promote protection of Shafter era ranching Historic Districts including the Point Reyes Dairy District and the Olema Valley Historic District. Are there other objectives the NPS should consider as part of this planning process? 3 Issues An issue describes the relationship between actions and environmental (i.e., natural, cultural, and socioeconomic) resources. Issues are usually problems that either the \"no action\" alternative or current situation has caused or that any of the proposed alternatives might cause. They may be questions, concerns, problems, or other relationships, including bene cial ones. Issues identi ed as a result of working and m eeting with ranchers that the Ranch CMP would con sider include: RANCH OPERATIONS/ACTIVITIES Review of permit structure Operational fl exibility Best management practices Grazing regime adaptation Manure management/compost opportunities Production of other domestic livestock Diversication (small scale row crop, value added operations within existing structures, etc.) Process for ranchers to request new activities MANAGEMENT OF TULE ELK ON RANCHLANDS Long-term plan to manage tule elk impacting ranch operations within Seashore managed lands Impacts to high value pasture and damage to fences Evaluate potential actions within and adjacent to active ranch operations to manage tule elk FLOODPLAINS, WETLANDS, RIPARIAN AREAS Buers for water quality protection Habitat enhancement SPECIES OF SPECIAL CONCERN Management opportunities to promote protection of sensitive and rare plant and wildlife species HEALTH and SAFETY Standards for operator and worker housing VEGETATION Restoration of native prairie Dunes Non-native species management Brush management Pasture improvement/increased forage production/silage Fire regime VISITOR USE/RECREATION Interpretive/education programs regarding historic and contemporary ranching operations Access Recreational opportunities Privacy protection for ranchers PLANNING & PROTECTION OF RANCH COMPLEXES Dene areas for ranch infrastructure improvements Dene roles and responsibilities for maintenance of existing infrastructure HISTORIC STRUCTURES Guidelines for standards for maintenance of existing historic structures Evaluate opportunities for development or placement of new structures in the context of cultural landscape CULTURAL LANDSCAPES Protection of Shafter era ranching Historic Districts Are there other issues or concerns that should be considered as we develop the Ranch CMP? 4 Tule Elk TULE ELK BACKGROUND UPCOMING TULE ELK T ule elk, the smallest subspecies of North American elk, only occurs in California. T ule elk were extirpated from Point Reyes by the 1860s. Consistent with Public Law 94-389, a total of 10 tule elk were successfully reintroduced to a 2,600-acre fenced wilderness reserve on T omales Point in 1978. This enclosed herd has grown to one of the largest in California, comprising 350 to 500 animals. The park's 1998 T ule Elk Management Plan/EA established the free-ranging herd with an interim management limit of 250-350 elk. The 1998 T ule Elk Management Plan/EA did not contemplate the expansion of tule elk into the pastoral lands. The free-ranging tule elk herd was established from 28 animals in 1999. There are two independent free-ranging herds. California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) manages most other tule elk herds in the state. FREE RANGE HERD CURRENT STATUS D Ranch Herd - 76 total animals. The main herd is a generally cohesive group of approximately 60 elk consisting of females, juveniles, and a few males. The remaining males form one to two small bachelor groups that remain separate from the main herd except during the rut. The main herd and bachelor groups spend time on C Ranch, E Ranch, the former D Ranch, and in surrounding areas with no cattle grazing. Limantour Herd - 71 total animals. These elk are spread over a wide area from Coast Camp to as far north as the D. Rogers Ranch adjacent to Sir Francis Drake Boulevard. The females, juveniles, and some males remain in the wilderness area. Approximately 25-30 males spend time on ranch lands along Estero Road through the Home Ranch area. Most activity is south of Sir Francis Drake Boulevard with only 6-8 tule elk to the north at any one time. The males return to the wilderness area during the rut. RECENT TULE ELK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES Ongoing monitoring since fall 2010 Ongoing elk crossing and cattle fence repairs since 2011 D Ranch water project completed in 2013 Hazing to push main herd o of active ranch lands since 2012 MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES Johne's Disease Testing Johne's disease (paratuberculosis) is a widespread disease which can occur in most ruminants and is known to occur in the tule elk at Point Reyes. Due to concerns about disease transmission to uninfected elk herds, Johne's disease remains a concern for any alt ernatives considering relocation of tule elk. The NPS will implement a Johne's disease testing program with University of Wisconsin -Johne's T esting Center in spring/summer 2014. Experimental Relocation within the Park The NPS intends to capture and relocate 3-4 younger elk from D Ranch back into the wilderness area to see what the response is by the elk. The response, such as integrate with Limantour herd or return to D Ranch, will help to inform the potential management solutions for this planning process. Potential relocation timeline could be after the rut in fall 2014. Johne's disease risk must be evaluated prior to any relocation. CDFW has observed that moving adults is not a viable approach because they will quickly return to their capture locations.
