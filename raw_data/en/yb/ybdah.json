Typically individuals on the autism spectrum will experience a combination of some or all of those symptoms, with varying degrees of severity. That means the condition can appear to be very different from person to person. [attention deficit hyperactivity disorder](/adhd/guide/)(ADHD), and [gastrointestinal](/digestive-health/common-digestive-conditions-from-top-bottom/)disorders. The general public and those who work with people with autism need to be aware of and sensitive to the wide variability of experiences of those who are on the spectrum, notes [Thomas Frazier II, PhD](https://www.autismspeaks.org/board-directors), an autism researcher and board member of Autism Speaks, an autism advocacy organization. \"The first step to understanding what autism is means focusing on each individual's set of difficulties and challenges and needs. You have to think, if you are a provider: 'How can I go about designing a plan to help them?'\" Everyone with autism has different cognitive abilities, social and communication skills, and behavior struggles, Dr. Frazier adds. \"Everybody's different, and you have to talk to the person and be empathetic.\" There's Only 1 Diagnosis for ASD, but It Includes Individuals With a Range of Disorders In 2013, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) combined what were once four separate diagnoses under the umbrella of autism spectrum disorders \u2014 ASD for short. In its report, the APA stated that the new definition for ASD represents \"a new, more accurate, and medically and scientifically useful way of diagnosing individuals with autism-related disorders.\" It's important to recognize, however, that many individuals living today with autism were given those diagnoses before 2013 and may still identify with those terms. Understanding the old diagnoses can help explain the range of symptoms and prognoses to expect for people with autism. Those diagnoses were: Autistic Disorder This diagnosis was the \"classic\" case of autism. Symptoms could include any combination of language challenges, repeating specific behaviors, learning disabilities, or problems with speech and nonverbal communication. Someone with this diagnosis might have also had very unique strengths and differences from others. [Asperger's](https://www.everydayhealth.com/aspergers/)have difficulty with social interaction and show signs of repetitive behaviors. These people may also have problems with motor development. But people who were given this diagnosis typically did not have serious delays with language or other kinds of cognitive development. [Learn More About Why Doctors No Longer Diagnose 4 Types of Autism](https://www.everydayhealth.com/autism/types/) Signs and Symptoms of Autism The signs of autism vary widely. But there are red flags parents and caregivers of babies and young children can look for. For babies and toddlers, the first sign of autism may be difficulty responding to their names when they are called, Frazier says. \"A lot of babies and toddlers who don't make appropriate eye contact, or who don't engage in joint attention with others, with a shared experience of observing an object or an event,\" may have autism, he adds. Displaying repetitive motor movements and behaviors are other key warning signs to watch out for in children. Dr. Veenstra-Vanderweele concurs that a person with autism may have trouble with \"two-way communication\" and may not respond much at all to someone addressing them. Sometimes people on the spectrum also exhibit an almost obsessive attention to very specific details. \"There was one child I worked with who was so interested in sharks I couldn't have a conversation about anything else that didn't include sharks,\" Veenstra-Vanderweele recounts. \"Some of those kids can't leave a topic behind in conversation. And sometimes they can't be motivated to do something or engage with something that doesn't involve that very specific, restricted interest.\" - Not pointing at objects when interested in them - Not looking at things someone else points to - Difficulty relating to others; or being interested in other people but not knowing how to talk, play, or interact - Avoiding eye contact and wanting to be by themselves - Difficulty understanding the feelings of others and talking about their own - Not enjoying being held or cuddled - Seeming unaware when people talk to them, but noticing other sounds - Repeating words or phrases said to them - Difficulty expressing their needs - Not playing \"pretend\" games - Repeating actions over and over again - Difficulty switching to new routines - Unusual responses to sensory stimuli, such as odors, sounds, or flavors - Loss of skills they used to have [Learn More About Autism Symptoms in Babies, Toddlers, Children, and Adults](https://www.everydayhealth.com/autism/signs-symptoms/) Causes and Risk Factors of Autism The medical community has yet to definitively explain why autism develops in some individuals and not in others. But there are several risk factors, both genetic and environmental, that have been found to be associated with the disorder, Veenstra-Vanderweele says. There are other potential risk factors. Prenatal exposure to some medications, premature birth, low birth weight, as well as the age of an individual's parents, may raise the odds. But a lot more research needs to be done to better understand those connections, Veenstra-Vanderweele says. Parents and pediatricians need to work together to communicate to everyone the fact that vaccinations do not cause autism, Veenstra-Vanderweele says. Not vaccinating children puts those children at higher risk for diseases and increases the risk of those diseases spreading to others. How Is Autism Diagnosed? There is no blood test or genetic profile (yet) that allows a doctor to conclusively make an autism diagnosis. Frazier says that diagnosing ASD involves looking at a child's behavior and overall development. Most pediatricians regularly screen all children for developmental delays and disabilities between 9 months and 30 months. But if your child has a sibling with ASD or if you or another caregiver has concerns that certain symptoms may be signs of autism, you can talk to your child's doctor at any time (or your doctor, if the concerns are about yourself). Initial autism screening usually involves checking that a child is meeting developmental milestones or if there are developmental delays. This could involve asking a parent questions about the child or interacting or playing with the child to see how he or she behaves. Duration of Autism Treatment and Medication Options for Autism Treatment for autism typically includes a combination of behavioral therapies, dietary approaches, medications, and complementary and alternative medicine approaches that best meet the needs of the individual. [Melatonin](/melatonin/guide/)may help with sleep problems, according to research. [acupuncture](/alternative-health/what-is-acupuncture-a-beginners-guide-to-how-it-works-and-how-it-may-improve-your-health/), and some, like hyperbaric oxygen or chelation, can be dangerous, notes the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health. Because autism varies so much from person to person in terms of symptoms and abilities, treatments must be customized, Frazier explains. But in general, early intervention is typically better, and all treatment tends to involve the child's family working closely with a team of doctors and caregivers. [Learn More About Treatments and Therapies for People With Autism](https://www.everydayhealth.com/autism/treatments-therapies-can-help-manage-symptoms-improve-development/) Prognosis The prognosis for people with ASD is as individual as they are. The extent of their developmental delays and the quality of the interventions they received \u2014 particularly early interventions \u2014 can make a difference in their outlook for education, work, and independent living. Complications of Autism [bipolar disorder](/bipolar-disorder/guide/), ADHD, [anxiety and depression](/anxiety/anxiety-and-depression.aspx). [cerebral palsy](/cerebral-palsy/). People with autism are also more likely to experience seizures and to have dental problems and gastrointestinal symptoms. Autism in Adults As mentioned above, you cannot get autism as an adult. But because there has been less awareness historically about screening for and diagnosing autism, there are individuals who are diagnosed with autism in adulthood, whose condition was missed when they were younger. And while some people with the disorder who are high-functioning, or those for whom treatment has allowed them to manage their symptoms, go on to college or vocational schools and enter the workforce \u2014 others with autism continue to need treatment and support through adulthood. And once school ends, the transition into adulthood can be difficult for individuals with autism, especially for those who are not high-functioning. Additionally, for those entering the workforce and for those with autism who are already adults, many other resources are available with information about financial assistance, services, and other support systems to meet an individual's needs. Research and Statistics: Who Has Autism? Researchers are currently investigating ASD's origins and early symptoms in an effort to make earlier diagnosis and intervention possible. Scientists are also looking at interventions, the overall health of people with ASD, as well as the health of their caregivers. Some notable areas of research include: [cannabis](/marijuana/)during pregnancy were 50 percent more likely to have a child with autism than those who did not. \"We need to figure out ways to try to best educate different segments of the population and help them accept and accommodate people with autism,\" Frazier says. \"What is the best way to train police in dealing with people with autism? How do we train employers to do a better job? How do we make living environments that are conducive to people [with autism]? How do we have hospitals that are sensory friendly? \"I think there is a lot of research and more that will be done that will look at how we make these societal improvements,\" he says. \"It's important to keep generating awareness and understanding and [so we] all do better to help people living with this.\" There is an enormous opportunity for research when it comes to understanding the genetic risk factors for autism as well, Frazier adds.
