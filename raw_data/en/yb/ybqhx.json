Nice to meet you, cutie. If you don't know my work.. no worries... On me? I started modeling when I was 15 in Southern California. After college, I enrolled myself into culinary school + then cooked at several California based restaurants (Including the Ritz Carlton Laguna Beach). I paid my way through school on my own (still am paying my loans!) by modeling. Somehow, maybe bc I was a surfer or a hapa, IDK? I became this pro at fit modeling for every bikini brand known to man: Roxy, Quiksilver women, Hurley, O'Neil, Vans, Op, Calvin Klein Swim, Betsey Johnson Swim, Billabong, Rampage Swim, W Swim, Natutica Swim, Becca, Speedo.. I really can't remember them all, there are a lot! Even my agents were always impressed that I would nail all of the swim//bikini clients. Hubba. Hubba. But yes.. it's true and I've just never talked about it until now, because I was too busy writing wellness cookbooks and developing hundreds of perfect recipes for you! So here's one of my secrets to get glowing, keep my abs flat, my body perfectly toned and hot before each bikini season....while still eating FOOD. So what exactly is the 3 part secret? It's three simple things that I like to call the \"Clean Green Cleanse.\" Here's what you're going to do for the next 7 days: 1- Clean Green Drinks: Replace breakfast & lunch with 2-3 Clean Green Drinks for the first 2 weeks (see below for some delicious recipes!) Additionally, drink 10 cups of water each day. An energy-boosting juice or matcha can be consumed during that mid-afternoon slump, and if you need a pick-me-up snack opt for an apple, banana or a handful of raw almonds! These next two weeks are about kickstarting your health, so it's important to be disciplined. 2- Clean Green Eats: Eat a clean and light dinner (like my [macrobiotic hijiki salad](https://candicekumai.com/macrobiotic-hijiki-avocado-salad/))! If you feel great after these two weeks of clean green drinks and clean eating, then continue to eat this way for another two weeks! Drop the pounds and gain more energy. 3- An exercise routine that you LOVE. Remember you must exercise for at least 30 minutes, daily! Find a routine you love so much, you soon become addicted to this way of life. Yes, there's such thing as a \"healthy addiction.\" My fave is, running, yoga or [The Bar Method.](http://thebarmethod.com) I've provided one-day menu example for you to try that I've developed in my own test kitchen. I've had all my elves test these recipes numerous times and I've seen them also drop weight while doing it. It's certainly not the focal point of this book- the focal point is to master your health and nutrition- but healthy weight loss can be a lovely addition. Feel free to mix and match juices and smoothies throughout the week, and cook up a delicious, clean and satisfying meal for yourself for dinner.
