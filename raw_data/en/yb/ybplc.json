Communications from the DeKalb County Sheriff's Department; the City of Auburn and the City of Garrett are now unified and we provide Police; Fire and EMS Dispatching to all agencies of DeKalb County Indiana. Texting to 9-1-1 Most recently we have begun to accept 9-1-1 text calls from wireless customers who may not be able to speak for various reasons. Callers who can, should always voice call 9-1-1 first but if they can't voice call, then they may use text messages. When using text to 9-1-1 do not use any abbreviations and spell everything out to avoid any confusion. Texting to 9-1-1 is slower than voice calls because the messages have to go through the network, the dispatcher needs to read them and then reply. When providing your location, please be as concise as you can, when providing an address be sure to include the City or Town since there are many duplicate streets names from one community to another.
