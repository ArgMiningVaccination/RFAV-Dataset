Gov. Chris Christie stepped, perhaps accidentally, into the center of a firestorm during his visit to the United Kingdom in discussing whether parents should vaccinate their children, in light of the measles outbreak that appears to have started at Disneyland. \"All I can say is that we vaccinated ours. That's the best expression I can give you of my opinion,\" said Christie. \"It's much more important, I think, what you think as a parent than what you think as a public official. And that's what we do. But I also understand that parents need to have some measure of choice in things as well so that's the balance that the government has to decide.\" The remarks touched off a reaction from Democrats, who asserted that he was courting support from people opposed to vaccinations for his pending presidential campaign, and medical professionals, who say vaccines are safe and preserve the public health - so long as nearly everyone participates. Assemblyman Herb Conaway Jr., D-Burlington, a doctor and chairman of the Assembly health committee, called Christie's comments irresponsible. \"Gov. Christie's failure to clearly state where he stands on vaccinations that protect everyone, especially our most vulnerable, is another example of his weak leadership and his inability to stand up for what's scientifically proven as being right,\" Conaway said. \"His lack of clarity is very disappointing and, from a medical point of view, disturbing.\" Within a few hours, Christie spokesman Kevin Roberts was compelled to issue a clarifying statement in an attempt to quell the growing story. \"To be clear: The governor believes vaccines are an important public health protection and with a disease like measles there is no question kids should be vaccinated,\" Roberts said. \"At the same time different states require different degrees of vaccination, which is why he was calling for balance in which ones government should mandate.\" Monmouth University political scientist Patrick Murray said Christie's answer was similar to past comments he made on the topic and wasn't that unreasonable, if you review the full statement. He likened it to President Barack Obama's clumsy \"you didn't build that\" line about business owners in 2012. \"This is probably Gov. Christie's welcome to the presidential fishbowl, where everything that you say can be taken out of context and you have to be extremely careful,\" Murray said. \"I don't think the answer that he gave was a measured answer designed to appeal to a certain base. I think it was just one of those things where you learn a lesson about how everything that you say gets magnified when you're running for president,\" he said. Christie's comments were made after a tour of a biomedical research center operated by MedImmune, the manufacturer of the flu vaccine FluMist, on the second day of a three-day trade mission to the United Kingdom. They also came as a measles outbreak centered in California has sickened more than 100 people in the United States. All states now require children to get certain vaccinations to enroll in school, although California and New Jersey are among 20 states that let parents opt out by obtaining personal belief waivers. Parents in New Jersey seeking a medical exemption have to submit a written statement from their doctor or registered nurse indicating why the exemption is needed. Some people worry that vaccines can cause developmental problems in children, despite scientific evidence disproving any link. Others object for religious or philosophical reasons. The New Jersey health department's guidelines on vaccines say that objections \"based on grounds which are not medical or religious in nature and which are of a philosophical, moral, secular, or more general nature continue to be unacceptable.\" Christie's comments stand in contrast to those of Obama, who said in an interview with NBC News that all parents should get their kids vaccinated. Those children who are not, he said, put infants and those who can't get vaccinations at risk. \"I understand that there are families that, in some cases, are concerned about the effect of vaccinations,\" Obama said. \"The science is, you know, pretty indisputable.\" On Friday, though, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said that while the science on vaccines is clear, \"The president certainly believes that these kinds of decisions are decisions that should be made by parents, because ultimately when we're talking about vaccinations, we're typically talking about vaccinations that are given to children.\" Contributing: Associated Press Michael Symons: (609) 984-4336; msymons@app.com Transcript of the exchange about vaccinations: Question: Governor you're here, this company makes vaccines. There's a debate going on right now in the United States, the measles outbreak that's been caused in part by people not vaccinating their kids. Do you think Americans should vaccinate their kids? Is the measles vaccine safe? Gov. Chris Christie: All I can say is that we vaccinated ours. That's the best expression I can give you of my opinion. It's much more important, I think, what you think as a parent than what you think as a public official. And that's what we do. But I also understand that parents need to have some measure of choice in things as well so that's the balance that the government has to decide. But I can just tell people from our perspective, Mary Pat and I have had our children vaccinated and we think it's an important part of making sure we protect their health and the public health. Question: But you're leaving people the option of not getting vaccinated and that potentially presents a great public risk. Christie: Michael, what I said was that there has to be a balance and it depends on what the vaccine is, what the disease type is and all the rest. And so I didn't say I'm leaving people the option. What I'm saying is that you have to have that balance in considering parental concerns because no parent cares about anything more than they care about protecting their own child's health and so we have to have that conversation, but that has to move and shift in my view from disease type. Not every vaccine is created equal and not every disease type is as great a public health threat as others. So that's what I mean by that so that I'm not misunderstood. Question: Do you think some vaccines are dangerous? Christie: I didn't say that. I said different disease types can be more lethal so that the concern would be measuring whatever the perceived danger is by vaccine and we've had plenty of that over a period of time versus what the risk to public health is and you have to have that balance and that's exactly what I mean by what I said.
