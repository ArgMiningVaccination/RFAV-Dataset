Alt hough a relatively new program, polic ymakers and advocates have already begun considering programmatic and po licy changes that would build on the existing program, expand eligibility, and broaden access to certain services. This study was initiated to better understand the factors affec ting enrollment in CWD and to estimate the enrollment and cost impacts of select programmatic changes. The California Working Disabled program curren tly covers individuals with net countable family incomes up to 250 percent of the fede ral poverty level (FPL) and assets up to $2,000 for an individual ($3,000 for a couple). Net countable income is derive d by exempting all disability- related income and disregardi ng the first $65 of earned inco me, impairment-related work expenses, and approximately half of the disabl ed person's earned income. Thus, some working disabled people can have overall income well ab ove 500 percent of FPL and still be eligible for the program. Relative to income eligibility requir ements for other Medi-Cal aid categories, the income threshold for CWD is quite high; the CWD a ssets threshold is the same as that used in many other aid categories. Enrollment in CWD totaled 652 as of June 2002, fa r below original enrollment estimates and the number of individuals estimated to be elig ible. Prior to implementation, the California Department of Health Services (DHS) estima ted that 7,000 to 14,000 individuals would enroll by the end of the second year of the program. T hus, enrollment in the CWD Program has reached only about ten percent of its estimated level. Th e modest enrollment experi ence to date made it important to assess the program in order to id entify whether program design changes are needed to allow larger numbers of disabled individuals in California to work while maintaining health care coverage through Medi-Cal. The goal of this study was to gain a better unders tanding of the factors affecting enrollment in CWD and to estimate the enrollment and cost impacts of select progr ammatic changes. To further study these issues, two sets of analyses were conducted. The first was a qualitative review of stakeholders' experience with the program. Th e experiences of CWD enrollees, those eligible 2 The California Working Disabled Program: Lessons Learned, Looking Ahead but not enrolled, and county eligibility workers were gathered to lend insight into the factors contributing to the program's current enrollment trend as well as to solicit suggestions for program improvement. This qualitative research in cluded an enrollee survey, and in some cases follow-up interviews; a teleconferen ce with a group eligible but not enrolled (nonenrollees); and telephone interviews with county eligibility workers. The second was a set of quantitative analyses of Census Bureau and DHS data to m odel program eligibility alternatives that might allow more disabled workers in California to a ccess Medi-Cal coverage. Th e enrollment and cost implications of these alternatives were also explored. CWD Enrollee, Nonenrollee, and Eligibility Worker Feedback Several themes emerged from the qualitative re search components that suggest ways of boosting enrollment in or improving the attractivene ss of the current CWD Program. These themes include: increasing program outreach to potential enrollees; improving eligibility worker knowledge of the program; improving program attractiveness; and addressing barriers to empl oyment for disabled people. Program Outreach Enrollees, nonenrollees, a nd eligibility workers agreed that th ere is a lack of public awareness about the program. Little program outreach has b een conducted by state or county agencies or by other community-based organizations, resulti ng in a significant lack of awareness and understanding of the program. The outreach th at has occurred has had a minimal effect.1 There has been little public or privat e coordination to make program in formation available at agencies providing services to the CWD Program's target population or to increa se the awareness of employees at those agencies. The enrollmen t trends experienced by the CWD Program\u2014 specifically, monthly growth of less than one pe rcent and creating little \"new\" enrollment (63 percent of enrollees were already in some ot her Medi-Cal aid category)\u2014demonstrates the effects of lack of outreach and awareness. Ma ny enrollees responding to this study's survey indicated that they did not hear of the program un til an eligibility worker advised them of it when they were already applying for or were having their eligibility redetermined for Medi-Cal. Study participants agreed that an increased ou treach effort would broaden program awareness among potentially eligible Californians. Suggestions for outre ach activities included launching an effort similar to the BabyCal outreach cam paign, using radio and television public service announcements, placing advertisements in high ly visible locations, and coordinating with community-based organizations provid ing services to similar populations. Eligibility Workers' Knowledge Enrollees, nonenrollees, and elig ibility workers alike raised the lack of eligibility worker awareness as a barrier to program enrollment. Eligibility workers often did not know that the program existed and in some cases advised poten tial applicants that there was no such program. The California Working Disabled Program: Lessons Learned, Looking Ahead 3 In other cases, individuals were enrolled in the program only after speaking with several different eligibility workers before finding one who was aware of the program. Other eligibility workers were sometimes misinformed about the income or asset eligibility requirements. Eligibility workers' lack of knowledge about CWD may be e xplained by the minimal training they receive2 and the relative infrequency of CWD cases. To determine eligibility, eligibility workers must complete appropriate CWD form s and calculate budgets manually, based on the program's eligibility rules regarding work and in come. These rules are different from rules for other Medi-Cal programs. For the most part, el igibility worker training for CWD consisted of receiving revised program manuals with accomp anying memoranda explaining the new program. The question regarding usefulne ss of increased training opportuni ties for eligibility workers received mixed responses. Enrollees, who rely heavily on eligibility workers for program information, as well as some wo rkers, thought increased training for eligibility workers would improve their knowledge of the program and its requirements. On the other hand, some eligibility workers thought training would be minimally effective because CWD cases arise infrequently, making it unlikely they would have the opportunity to exercise the newly gained information. Respondents also cited limited elig ibility worker time a nd limited administrative resources as barriers to the effectiveness of elig ibility worker training. Eligibility workers face large and growing caseloads, and may find it diffic ult to understand the nu ances of the dozens of Medi-Cal aid categories. In this rather hectic environment, c ounty eligibility workers may have little enthusiasm for CWD training sessions. Program Attractiveness Asset Limits Many study participants thought that the asset limit was too low. Several participants commented that they purposely limited certain assets once enro lled because Medi-Cal \" doesn't let them have anything.\" Still unknown is the degree to which otherwise eligible indi viduals choose not to enroll in the program because they want to re tain their assets\u2014in par ticular, those who have never been enrolled in Medi-Cal and who receive Social Security Disability Income (SSDI), a program for which there is no asset limit and whos e beneficiaries largely comprise the target population for CWD. However, many participants did not have to dispose of assets to qualify for CWD, which can be explained in part by their en rollment in other Medi-Cal aid programs prior to enrolling in CWD. Increasing the asset limit would result in maki ng more individuals eligible for the CWD Program, but it would not guarantee their enrollment. Eligible i ndividuals who have thus far opted not to enroll because of the asset limit w ill have to assess whether any changes in the asset level are sufficient to influence their enrollme nt decision. Understanding the factors related to asset limits that discourage eligible individua ls from enrolling will facilitate policymakers' decision making with respect to whether and what type of asset limit changes are warranted, and will effectively yield increased program enrollment. Employment Uncertainty Finding and maintaining employment can be difficult for individua ls with disabilities. Finding employment suited to or flexible enough to acco mmodate the health or personal care needs of 4 The California Working Disabled Program: Lessons Learned, Looking Ahead individuals with disabilities is challenging. Some employers might be wary of hiring disabled workers due to concerns about company liabi lity as well as worker productivity and dependability. Once individuals with disabilities have secured empl oyment, they then face the challenge of maintaining their jobs. Without em ployment, eligibility for CWD is also lost.3 Individuals who lose eligibility for CWD can retain their Medi-C al coverage but are reassigned to the Aged, Blind, and Disabled-Medically Needy (Medically Needy) aid category, which provides full Medi-Cal coverage bu t requires enrollees to pay a shar e of their medical costs (i.e., share-of-cost) if their net countable income exceeds the limit for eligibility. Several survey respondents noted the irony in charging a working individual with disabilities a monthly premium that is often lower than the monthly share of cost char ged to disabled individuals who are not working. Several enrollees identified assistance finding employment as a needed program improvement. While employment assistance fits within the state's goals of creating work incentives and improving workplace participation of Californian s with disabilities, specific employment assistance activities would most likely be beyon d the purview of the Department of Health Services. A coordinated effort between DHS and agencies whose functions are more directly related to employment, could improve the effect iveness of state activities to create work incentives and provide employment assistance. Affordability Enrollees stated that the premium requirement fo r CWD was more affordable than the share of cost they would otherwise pay for Medically Needy Medi-Cal or their premium payments for private coverage. Most enrollees pay the mini mum $20 premium. However, CWD premiums can be as high as $250 per month for individuals with relatively high net countable incomes. For those individuals who are required to pay cons iderably higher premiums, and for individuals with infrequent health care needs, paying th e monthly premium may be burdensome or seem unreasonable if they are not receiv ing health services in the m onth. They may instead choose to enroll in the Medically Needy Me di-Cal program, where they are only responsible for their share of cost in months when they have received a service. CWD premiums are already based on a sliding income scale, but at higher incomes, they are far more than the average premium other workers ac ross the country pay for coverage through their employer. In 2001, the average employee contribu tion toward health c overage was $38 per month for single coverage.4 Adjusting premiums at higher inco me levels may ease the burden of some eligible individuals who are not enrolled be cause they are unable to afford the relatively high monthly premium. Enrollment and Cost Impacts of Potential CWD Program Changes In the modeling component of this study, three al ternatives to expanding eligibility based on the changes proposed in AB 925, as introduced, were explored to determine whether increasing income and asset level standard s for CWD would result in in creased enrollment. The three options explored were: 1. raising the income limit to 450 percent of FPL; The California Working Disabled Program: Lessons Learned, Looking Ahead 5 2. eliminating asset level restrictions; and 3. raising the income limit to 450 percent of FPL and eliminating restrictions on assets (combination of the first two options). All three alternatives were initially considered ways to increase the pool of CWD eligibles and therefore ways to increase enrollment in CWD. However, expanding income and asset eligibility under the CWD Program, while resulting in a significant increase in the number of potentially eligible individuals, is not projected to significantly boost enrollment. It is estimated that without other program changes, only 189 additional enro llees would enter the program. This figure applies the current enrollment rate5 (0.17 percent) to the estimated 141,000 uninsured working disabled who would become eligible under the most generous altern atives explored. The estimated net annual program cost of these expansions is approximately $893,400. Conclusion This modeling, along with the qualitative data of th is study, suggests that a si gnificant increase in enrollment is unlikely if elig ibility expansions are implemen ted without other programmatic changes such as expanding program outreach an d improving community and eligibility worker awareness of the CWD Program. The expansions modeled for this study are collectively projected to yield only 189 new enrollees. The qu alitative data suggest that program enrollment would increase with expanded outreach and impr oved eligibility worker and public awareness, even without other program expans ions. For those who weigh the pros and cons of enrolling and choose not to enroll in CWD, increased outreach or eligibility worker training may not be enough to influence their decision to enroll. For individuals who face issu es like the \"SSDI cash cliff\" (in which they risk losing eligibility of SSD I benefits as a result of increased earnings) or who are infrequent users of health care services , other program changes might be necessary to influence their enrollment decisions. 6 The California Working Disabled Program: Lessons Learned, Looking Ahead I. Introduction Policy Context National Policy Across the country, there is a movement to enable individuals with disabili ties to fully participate in their communities, including participating in the workforce. In February 2001, the President announced the New Freedom Initiative, a fede ral-government-wide commitment to improve federal programs serving i ndividuals with disabilities.6 This initiative includes an ongoing commitment to reduce a barrier to employment f aced by individuals with disabilities\u2014the threat of losing their health care coverage\u2014by encour aging states to implement Medicaid Buy-In programs for disabled workers. Even before the New Freedom Initiative, states have had the authority to provide Medicaid coverage to working individuals with disabilities who would otherwise be ineligible due to their incomes or resource levels. The Balanced Budge t Act of 1997 (BBA) esta blished the Medicaid Buy-In Program in which indivi duals who met the Social Securi ty definition of disability,7 and whose income was less than 250 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL) using Supplemental Security Income (SSI) standards, an d who met the SSI resource standards8 could buy into Medicaid by paying a monthly premium. Premiu ms can be based on income, and Medicaid Buy- In programs must offer the same comprehensiv e coverage as other categorical Medicaid coverage groups. In 2000, the Ticket to Work and Work Incentive s Improvement Act (TWWIIA) expanded states' authority to provide Medicaid to workers with disabilities between the ages of 16 and 64 who would be eligible for SSI if not for their incomes or resources. Th is eligibility group is called the Basic Coverage Group. TWWIIA also estab lished a new coverage group, the Medical Improvement Group, which covers working individua ls with a disability who no longer meet the SSI definition of disability. States can estab lish Medicaid income and resource eligibility standards using the au thority in 1902(r)(2) of the Social Security Act, which permits states to use more liberal income and resource rules than are used in SSI, and establis h their own cost-sharing standards. Ensuring access to he alth care coverage for workers with disabilities was just one The California Working Disabled Program: Lessons Learned, Looking Ahead 7 component of the broader TWWIIA legislation, which also include d provisions to expand access to worker training and job placement a ssistance programs and benefits planning. One goal of Medicaid Buy-In progra ms is to create incentives for individuals with disabilities to participate in the workforce. They can now work and earn income without losing their Medicaid coverage. Access to health care coverage is a critical component of enabling workforce participation; however, the decision to work is influenced by several factors apart from health care coverage. A threshold issue is whether individuals with disabilities can find empl oyment, which TWWIIA addresses through provisions relating to work su pports. Another consider ation is the kind of health-related supports needed once in the workpl ace. Some individuals with disabilities need assistance with activities of daily living such as toileting, taking medications, transferring in and out of wheelchairs, etc. Some individuals requir e the use of personal assistant services in the workplace, but paying for these services can be onerous. Some state Medicaid programs cover personal assistant services but are often only covered in the ho me or are subject to other restrictions. Individuals who wish to work and need workplace personal care but cannot afford the out-of-pocket costs if the services are not co vered by their health plan, may be forced to either limit or forgo workforce participation altogether. Other work disincentives also exist. Many i ndividuals with disabilities who work face the \"Social Security Disability Income (SSDI) cash cliff.\" Individuals rece iving SSDI can already work, but must limit earnings to the federal s ubstantial gainful activit y (SGA) level of $780 per month (in 2002), or risk forfeiting their SSDI pa yment. While eligibility rules for Medicaid Buy- In programs allow individuals to earn above this amount, individuals might limit how much they work or earn to stay within SSDI limits a nd ensure their conti nued access to SSDI. California's Policy Context The state of California implemented the Calif ornia Working Disabled (CWD) Program under BBA authority in April 2000. Working individual s with disabilities a nd with net countable family incomes below 250 percent of FPL and assets less than $2,000 for an individual ($3,000 for a couple) can enroll in CWD. The CWD Progr am uses the SSI rules for income, including earned income disregards,9 and spousal deeming rules apply.10 Enrollees are required to pay premiums ranging from $20 to $250 for individu als or from $30 to $375 for couples, based on their income. All of the applicant's disability-related income is exempt, and impairment-related work expenses, and some earned income, are de ducted from income calculations. To determine whether an individual's assets fall within CWD limits, employer or individual retirement accounts and certain property are exempt. CWD enrollees are required to pr ovide proof of employment, such as pay stubs, but \"work\" is otherwise undefined. Individuals are required to report changes in their employment or other eligibility status. Individuals who lose their employment due to \"good cause\" can retain their CWD coverage for two months. Good cause includes hospitalization, inability to work as a result of the individual's disability, or other r easons beyond the contro l of the enrollee. Enrollees in need of personal as sistant services can obtain those services, if they qualify, through the In-Home Supportive Services Program (IHSS) administered by the Department of Social 8 The California Working Disabled Program: Lessons Learned, Looking Ahead Services. Individuals receiving IHSS are automatically eligible for Medi-Cal. The In-Home Supportive Services Programs has two componen t programs. The Personal Care Services Program (PCSP), through which most personal assistant services are provided, is paid for by Medi-Cal. The Residual In-Home Services Program covers those who are not eligible for PCSP, including those who receive advance pay,11 those whose provider is a s pouse or parent, or those in protective supervision. Both IHSS program s provide a maximum of 283 hours of personal attendant services each month, based on a needs assessment. Personal attendant services (PAS) through IHSS were restricted to the home and we re not provided in the workplace. In December 2002, DHS submitted a state plan amendment requesti ng federal approval to cover PCSP in the workplace effective January 1, 2003. Under the ne w option, Medi-Cal would pay for workplace PAS, but the total number of authorized PAS hour s would not change. This will ensure that the program does not incur PAS expenditu res beyond what was already budgeted. A 1999 fiscal analysis of CWD conducted by DHS estimated that between 6,835 and 13,811 individuals would be enrolled for CWD by the end of the second year.12 This estimate was based on enrollment of eligible indivi duals who might already be enroll ed in other Medi-Cal programs serving disabled individuals and from the experien ces of other states that were working to boost enrollment in Medicaid work incentive programs. Th e fiscal analysis also assumed that, at least in the first year of implementation, that only cu rrent Medi-Cal enrollees with a share of cost would enroll in CWD. CWD enrollment thus far ha s fallen far short of original DHS estimates. As of June 2002, only 652 were enrolled in the progr am. More than half of enrollees (63 percent) were previously enrolled in ot her Medi-Cal categories, cons istent with DHS's original assumptions. On February 23, 2001, California Assemblyme mber Dion Aroner introduced AB 925, The Workforce Inclusion Act, which would have im plemented and broadened employment supports for workers with disabilities and would have amended the CWD Program. As introduced, The Workforce Inclusion Act would have made the following changes to CWD: raised the earned income eligibil ity limit to 450 percent of FPL; authorized up to 18 months of coverage for enrollees who lose employment due to circumstances beyond their control; authorized the provision of personal assi stant services in pl aces of employment, education, and vocational training services; authorized individuals receiving advance pay to purchase personal assistant services to enroll in the Personal Ca re Services Program; established \"designated independence acc ounts\" for paying for employment- related products and services; raised the resource and income eligibility standards to the limits for a spouse in the community when the other spouse is in a nursing facility; and transferred the authority for CWD from the BBA to TWWIIA. The California Working Disabled Program: Lessons Learned, Looking Ahead 9 Only after significantly amending AB 925 in res ponse to the state's deep budget deficit did the state legislature pass the legisl ation. The remaining provision mo st directly affecting CWD was the authorization of state-funded personal assistan t services allowable in the work place. Other employment support activities we re retained; however, other pr ovisions related to changes in CWD eligibility standards were struck. Governor Gray Davis signed AB 925 into law on September 29, 2002. On January 10, 2003, Governor Davis releas ed his proposed state budget for 2003-2004. To address California's $35 billion deficit, the proposed budget includes cu ts across programs, including Medicaid. The governor's budget proposes to cu t eligibility for the Medi-Cal Aged and Disabled (A&D) Program from 133 per cent of FPL to 100 percent of FPL.13 The 26,000 individuals who would lose eligibility for the A& D Program could enroll in either the Medically Needy Program or CWD (if they meet CWD wo rk and premium requirements). The governor's proposal also included a new job training, placement, and recruitm ent initiative that would help 5,000 disabled individuals find employment a nd would increase awareness of available programs.14 Disabilities in California Social Security Programs Two major programs administered by the Social S ecurity Administration provide cash benefits to eligible individuals with disabi lities. The Social Security Di sability Income (SSDI) program makes benefit payments to individuals with disa bilities, and certain family members, who have worked a sufficient number of years and paid soci al security taxes. If the individual is still working, he or she may not perform substantia l gainful activity or earn more than $780 per month (in 2002). SSDI is not means-tested. Indi viduals receiving SSDI for 24 months are also eligible for Medicare. The Soci al Security Administration repor ted that in December 2000, just over 437,000 disabled California wo rkers received SSDI payments.15 The average SSDI benefit paid in California in December 2000 was $799.16 The Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program is means-tested and makes payments to aged, blind, and disabled individuals with low or no income. California supplements SSI payments with state supplemental payments (SSP) and pr ovides automatic Medi-Cal coverage to all SSI/SSP recipients without requir ing them to complete a separa te application. The California Department of Social Services reports that in November 2002, 1.1 million people received SSI/SSP payments; 742,939 of these people were disabled.17 The average monthly SSI/SSP payment for disabled recipients in September 2002 was $576.18 Medi-Cal Coverage of Individuals with Disabilities Medi-Cal automatically covers SSI/SSP recipi ents and those receiving IHSS, as well as individuals with disabilities, thr ough several other aid categories. As stated earlier, the Medi-Cal Aged and Disabled Program covers people with countable monthly income less than 133 percent of FPL and with resources valued at less than $2,000 for individuals. This includes individuals 65 years or older, individuals with disabilities who would qualify for SSI but for their income, and people who receive SSDI or other So cial Security disability benefits. 10 The California Working Disabled Program: Lessons Learned, Looking Ahead Others may be covered under the Aged, Bli nd, and Disabled Medica lly Needy (Medically Needy) program. The Medically Needy Program covers individuals ages 65 or older or individuals determined to be disabled under fe deral rules. Depending on the individual's income, he or she may be required to pay a monthly share of cost to keep this coverage. Individuals who have a share of cost are require d to pay medical expenses until their income is reduced to the family maintenance need level, after which Medi-Cal provides full coverage. The family maintenance need level is an amount set by the state that represents the minimum amount a medically needy individual requires to meet his or her basic need s for food, clothing, and shelter. Family maintenance need levels range from $600 per month for an individual to $1,100 per month for a family of four. Share of cost amounts vary and can be as high as or higher than several hundred dollars because there is no upper income eligibility limit for the Medically Needy Program. The Pickle Program also covers individuals with disa bilities. The Pickle Program covers individuals who would continue to be eligible for SSI/SSP benefits if the cost- of-living adjustments made to their SSDI benefit were not counted as income. Some disabled individuals work ing at SGA (i.e., those earning $780 per month) can retain their Medi-Cal coverage through sect ion 1619(a) and 1619(b) provis ions. Under 1619(a), individuals who are disabled continue to receive SSI paym ents and therefore Medi caid, even though their earned income is at SGA, if the individual conti nues to meet other SSI eligibility criteria. Under 1619(b), individuals with earned in come at SGA can also qualify for continued Medicaid without receiving SSI benefits if they need Medi-Cal to continue work ing and if they meet other SSI eligibility requirements. Individuals can keep Me di-Cal coverage until their earnings reach the \"1619(b) threshold,\" currently $25,701. As of December 2001, some 4,186 individuals participated in 1619(a) and 6,778 participated in 1619(b).19 Medi-Cal coverage programs fo r individuals with disabilitie s are summarized in Table 1. California's Disabled Population Critical to understanding the e xperience of the CWD Program is examining the population that the program was designed to serve. The Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) was used to project the number of di sabled Californians by family income level, health coverage status, and workforce participa tion. Tables 2, 3, and 4 summarize these estimates for disabled Californians in the 18 to 64 age range. Table 2 presents the distribution of California's estimated three million disabled adults by gross family income and health coverage status. Nearly half (48 percent) of the disabled adults have private insurance and 25 percen t are covered by Medi-Cal. Am ong those covered by Medi-Cal, 76 percent are only covered by Medi-Cal, with the remainder having dua l Medi-Cal/Medicare coverage. Nearly 600,000 disabled adults, or 20 percent of Californi a's disabled adult population, are uninsured. Table 3 recategorizes the same disabled population through a simulation of Medi-Cal's net countable income criteria for the CWD Program. The net countable income calculation disregards all disability income, such as SSI and SSDI, the first $65 of a disabled person's earnings, and half of the disabled person's remaining earnings. The net countable standard nearly doubles the number of disabled Californians who are eligible for CWD based on income The California Working Disabled Program: Lessons Learned, Looking Ahead 11 Table 1.

Under th e gross income standard (Table 2), 43 percent of all disabled Californians (1.3 m illion) reside in families with incomes below 250 percent of FPL. Under the net countable income standa rd, 80 percent of disabled Californians (2.4 million) are below 250 percent of FPL. Using the CWD net countable income rules brings more than one million disabled people into the less than 250 percent of FPL income category who would otherwise be categorized as having incomes greater than 250 percent of FPL income if a gross family income calculation was used. Ba sed on income alone, these individuals would be eligible for CWD. Table 4 presents the degree to wh ich disabled adults have a work force presence. The top half of Table 4 presents the number of disabled adults who are working at leas t on a part-time basis by net countable family income and health coverage status; the bottom half i ndicates the percentage of disabled adults who are in the workforce in ea ch cohort, dividing the figur es in the top half of Table 4 by the corresponding values in Table 3. Nearly half (48 per cent) of California's disabled adults are in the workforce, a population of nearly 1.5 million people. While 72 percent (one million) of privately insured disabled adults and 44 percent (263,000) of uninsured disabled adults are working, only 18 percent (133,000) of Me di-Cal-covered disabled adults are in the workforce. Table 4 also shows that slightly more than one million working disabled Californians have net countable family incomes below 250 percent of FPL, making them eligible for enrollment in CWD based on only income. Most of these peop le (64 percent) are already covered through private health insurance, 12 percent are al ready covered by Medi-C al, and 22 percent are uninsured. A large uninsured working di sabled population of approximately 220,000 Californians exists, all appearing to be eligible for CWD by virtue of the net countable income standard. The Experiences of Other States To understand how California's Medicaid Buy-In progr am is performing, it is useful to examine the experiences of other states that have chosen to exerci se this option. As of December 19, 2002, 26 states have implemented Medicaid Buy-In programs.20 These states are Alaska, Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampsh ire, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Utah, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. There is a wide variation in how stat es determine income and asset eligibility. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Servi ces recently published case studies of nine state Medicaid Buy-In programs.21 The studies compare the program de sign and implementation experiences of Alaska, Connecticut, Iowa, Maine, Minneso ta, Nebraska, Oregon, Vermont, and Wisconsin. In early 2002, total progra m enrollment in these states was 1 3,000 enrollees. Of these states, four (Alaska, Connecticut, Iowa, and Minnesota) have exceeded projected enrollment, while one state (Nebraska) fell short of their estimated enroll ment. Table 5 compares California's Medicaid Buy-In Programs with those underway in Connecticut, Maine, and Oregon. The California Working Disabled Program: Lessons Learned, Looking Ahead 13 Table 3.

The key difficu lty is that states' ba seline Medicaid programs have a myriad of different aid categories in which disabled people are enrolled, with the eligibility rules governing each aid category varying widely both across states and often within a state as well. Unraveling these complexities w ould be a significant und ertaking and is beyond the scope of this study.22 However, previous research indicates that existing state Medicaid programs already serving individuals with di sabilities strongly affect enrollment levels in Medicaid Buy-In 14 The California Working Disabled Program: Lessons Learned, Looking Ahead programs for the working disabled. States with relatively generous Medicaid eligibility standards prior to implementing a Buy-In program have lowe r enrollment in their B uy-In programs, largely because the individuals who could potentially enro ll in the Buy-In programs are already enrolled in Medicaid through an existing aid category.23 Table 5.

The study was designed to incorporate the perspectives of program stakehol ders including: (1) those enro lled in CWD (through an enrollee survey); (2) those eligible but not enrolled in the program (dis cussions through teleconferences); and (3) county eligibility workers who play a cri tical role in educating and enrolling eligible individuals (with interviews). Th e study also used quantitative analysis to examine enrollment trends since the program's incep tion as well as to model variou s programmatic changes to the program to determine if they might increase acce ss to the program for a substantial number of working disabled individuals. This study also sheds light on the extent to wh ich the CWD Program has enabled individuals to enter the workforce or increase their workforce participation. This study provides some insight into the issues and challenges a ffecting individuals' ability to find and maintain employment, the need for personal assistant services, a nd work disincentives and incentives. When the enrollee survey was fielded, Medi-Cal covered personal assistan t services (PAS) only in the home, but DHS was developing an option to provide PAS outside the home. The inability to pay for workplace PAS out of pocket could prevent some individuals from working. The study also attempted to gain an understanding of the impact of providing PAS in the workplace, including whether it would enable greater workforce participation. To date, the impact of the program on private and employer-sponsored coverage is negligible. A large percentage of CWD enrolle es have come from other Medi -Cal aid categories. It is unknown to what extent program expansion would result in the emergence and enrollment of individuals who previously were covered thr ough an employer. It was also unknown to what degree any crowd-out of private coverage would occur (i.e., i ndividuals leaving private or employer-sponsored plans to move into less expens ive CWD coverage). An analysis of survey respondents' health coverage be fore and after enrolling in CWD provides some limited insight into whether enrollees are dropping private covera ge in favor of CWD. The potential fiscal implications of a crowd-out effect have been ci ted as a concern with both the initial development of the CWD Program and subsequent expansions. Data and Methods This study used four methods to analyze the effects of the CWD Program and to understand whether the program's modest en rollment was symptomatic of a l ack of demand or need for the program and the expansions as proposed in AB 925, or if other factors were influencing enrollment. Modeling The cost and enrollment impacts of CWD Program expansions modeled after those originally proposed in AB 925 were estimated using data from the Census Bureau's Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP)24 and data supplied by DHS. 16 The California Working Disabled Program: Lessons Learned, Looking Ahead Specifically, the cost and enrollment impacts of the three policy change options described below were modeled. 1. raising the income threshol d to 450 percent of FPL; or 2. eliminating the asset test fo r people in the CWD Program; or 3. raising the income threshold to 450 percent of FPL and eliminating the asset test (options 1 and 2 combined). Enrollee Survey A total of 620 enrollees were surveyed by ma il regarding their health coverage, workforce participation, and satisfac tion with the CWD Program.25 The survey was administered in conjunction with the DHS Medi-Cal Eligibility Branch to ensure that the confidentiality of enrollees was protected. Responde nts were given the opportunity to share more detailed information regarding their experience with CWD by volunteer ing their names and phone numbers for a follow-up telephone interview. To encourage enrollees to return completed surveys and to thank respondents for their par ticipation, a 15-minute phone card was included in all survey packets free of charge, regardless of whether they completed the survey. The survey instrument is included in Appendix A. A total of 162 responses26 were received, producing an overa ll 26 percent response rate. One- third (53) of the respondents requested a follow- up interview. Multiple attempts were made to reach respondents who agreed to a follow-up ca ll and 32 were successfully reached. During the follow-up calls, interviewees were asked to expand on their survey responses and were encouraged to share their enrollment expe rience and ideas for improving the program. The supplemental information obtained through follow-up interviews and select enrollee profiles are included in this paper to illustra te the real-life challenges in obtaining health coverage and in participating in the workforce experienced by some working individuals with disabilities, and the impact of CWD on their lives. This report refers to those who returned completed surveys as respondents and the respondents who participat ed in follow-up interviews as interviewees . Nonenrollee Teleconference One of the study's objectives was to capture a nd describe a range of perspectives on the California Working Disabled Prog ram, including those of individuals eligible for the program but not enrolled. The goal in speaking with th ese individuals was to better understand their reasons for not enrolling and to identify some potential improvements to the program. Unlike enrollees, there is no discrete roster of this nonenrolled population, creating significant challenges to obtaining their input. To capture this important but al l-too-often absent perspective, two strategies were pursued. The initial effo rt to reach nonenrollees involved conducting a teleconference during which pa rticipants discussed the CW D Program, including enrollment barriers and disincentives. The s econd strategy was to identify nonenrollees and conduct one-on- one interviews. The participation in both activities was minimal. The California Working Disabled Program: Lessons Learned, Looking Ahead 17 County Eligibility Worker Interviews County Medi-Cal eligibility work ers were interviewed in 11 coun ties representing varying levels of CWD enrollment and overall population. These counties included Contra Costa, Fresno, Los Angeles, Orange, Sacramento, San Bernardi no, San Diego, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara, and Ventura. Initial contact with counties wa s made with either program office staff or the designated county coordinator for CWD.27 Each of the counties agr eed to participate. Each participant was asked to answer questions on the following issues : outreach, eligibility worker training, eligibility determinations, challe nges, and suggestions for improvement. 18 The California Working Disabled Program: Lessons Learned, Looking Ahead II. Characteristics of Existing CWD Enrollees To understand whom the CWD Program has impacted thus far, enrollment and claims data from DHS were analyzed. This section desc ribes enrollment in CWD, including: enrollment trends; demographic mix of enrollees; distribution of enrolle es by California county; claims costs; and movement into and out of the program. Enrollment History Enrollment into the CWD Program began in early 2000 and has climbed, albeit rather slowly, at a rate of approximately 20 net additional enro llees per month. The quarterly progression of enrollment is shown in Table 6. Currently, about 650 people are enrolled in CWD, representing less than one percent of the pr ogram's target population of uni nsured working disabled people with net countable income be low 250 percent of FPL. These numbers are far below initial enrollment estimates developed by DHS before the program was implemented. DHS projected that between 6,835 and 13,811 indivi duals would enroll in CWD by the end of the program's second year. The DHS estimate was based on hist orical participation in SSI/SSP, SSDI, and Medi-Cal, but did not account fo r individuals who were not alre ady receiving these benefits and would become eligible for Medi-Cal. Most enrollees in CWD have very low incomes. About 70 percent of the enrollees are paying the minimum monthly premium of $20, reflecting income well below 100 percent of FPL. Thus, the program is enrolling few people toward the upper end of the 250 percent FPL income cut-off. In fact, given their income level enrollees below 10 0 percent of FPL might qualify for several other Medi-Cal programs. These other programs, however , do not provide the same work incentives as the CWD Program, (e.g., the ability to earn more or to keep individual re tirement accounts).

Demographic Mix The age and gender distribution of CWD enrollees is presented in Table 7. All enrollees are at least 21 years old, and the majority are older workers. About two-th irds of the enrollees are older than 45, and ten percent are 65 or older. The prog ram's enrollees are even ly distributed\u2014males, 52 percent and females, 48 percent\u2014with fema les outnumbering males in the 46 and older age cohorts and males outnumbering females in the 21 to 45 age cohort. It is notable that under AB 925 as introduced, people aged 65 or older would be ineligible for CWD because the program's authority would have been changed from the BBA to TWWIIA. While presumably the net effect of implementing changes proposed in the legislati on would enable more individuals to enroll in the program, the 63 people aged 65 or older currently enrolled in the program would be forced to find alternative sources of coverage.

The CWD enrollment distribution by county as of June 2002 is shown in Table 9. No county had more than 100 CWD enrollees\u2014San Diego had the state's largest enrollment with 79 enrollees. Ten counties' share of the statewide CWD enro llment was more than two percentage points above its share of statewide overall disabled Medi-Cal enrollment; thes e counties are Contra Costa, Humboldt, Napa, Orange , San Diego, San Luis Obispo, San Mateo, Santa Barbara, Santa Cruz, and Ventura. Five counties' share of th e statewide CWD enrollment was more than two percentage points below its share of statewid e overall disabled Medi-Cal enrollment; these counties are Fresno, Kern, Los Angeles, Sacramen to, and San Bernardino. While individuals in Los Angeles County comprise 30 percent of all Medi -Cal disabled enrollees, only nine percent of CWD enrollees reside in Los Angeles County.

Table 10 presents the monthly progression of clai ms expenses incurred by the CWD enrollees. Across the 12-month period of November 2001 through October 2002, almost $3.3 million in claims were paid on behalf of CWD enro llees. CWD enrollee claims are averaging enrollee per month, or $6,000 per enrollee year. Table 10. Overview of Monthly Claims Costs Month of Claim Payment Sum of Claims Paid During Month Enrollment Two Months Prior Average Cost per Enrollee July 2001 $26,468 410 $65 August 2001 $161,226 428 $377 September 2001 $195,127 450 $434 October 2001 $209,507 478 $438 November 2001 $188,674 508 $371 December 2001 $277,113 519 $534 January 2002 $219,873 543 $405 February 2002 $231,442 558 $415 March 2002 $230,674 575 $401 April 2002 $288,358 585 $493 May 2002 $237,406 595 $399 June 2002 $259,019 605 $428 July 2002 $308,627 615 $502 August 2002 $294,074 625 632 $634 October 2002 Most Recent 12 Mos. NA $468 Source: Data file produced by DHS. Note: Enrollment from two months prior to the month of payment is used to adjust for the gap between date of service and date of payment. Table 11 presents the distributi on of CWD-paid claims by provide r type across the time period July 2001 through October 2002. Pharmacy expenses comprised the majority of claims payments (74 percent) and represent a pproximately $350 in costs per en rollee per month. The relatively large share of claims paid to pharmacies in this aid code is attributable, at l east in part, to the fact that a sizable proportion of CWD enrollees (80 percent) are dually eligible for Medicare and Medi-Cal. Medi-Cal is a secondary payer to Medicare for most serv ices, but is the primary payer for pharmacy because prescription drugs are not c overed by Medicare. The fact that more than 40 percent of CWD enrollees res ponding to this study's survey reported having a mental disorder (see Table 18) is also likely to contribute to the high rate of pharmacy expenditures because mental disorders are frequently treated and managed through a regimen of prescription drugs. 24 The California Working Disabled Program: Lessons Learned, Looking Ahead Table 11. Distribution of CW D Claims Costs by Provider Type (Claims Paid from July 2001-October 2002) Provider Type Amount Paid Percentage Ambulance $5,342 0.1% Dialysis $43,835 1.1% Durable Table 12 presents the distri bution of CWD claims costs by each individual enrollee. Approximately 42 percent of the CWD enrollees incurred less than $1,000 in Medi-Cal claims during the period June 2001 to October 2002. T hose people generating more than $10,000 in Medi-Cal claims comprised 10.8 percent of the enro llees, but more than half (54.1 percent) of all CWD claims costs. Note that most of these people were not enrolled in CWD throughout the entire 17-month time period analyzed. A detailed analysis of indivi dual CWD enrollees' claims cost progressions on a month-by-month basis was also performed. In any given mont h, approximately 75 to 80 percent of the CWD enrollees incurred at least one claim. Of the 457 enrollees with claims in April of 2002, 64 percent had claims paid on their behalf in every month during the six-mo nth period April 2002 to Sept 2002. Thus, a large group of CWD enrollees are very consistent users of Medi-Cal covered services. This is explained to a large degree by the extensive use of pharmacy benefit among the CWD enrollees, given that people using the pharmacy benefit often generate a steady stream of monthly claims. It is noteworthy that a sizable (though smalle r) group of low-users a nd nonusers within CWD seems willing to pay the monthly premium \"just for coverage's sake.\" As shown in Table 12, 112 CWD enrollees had not generated $100 in clai ms costs, although all of these people are paying at least a $20 monthly premium. This group of enrollees may consist of individuals who also have some other source of coverage a nd only use CWD as wrap-around coverage or individuals who are disabled but have infrequent health care need s. These individuals may have faced the question of whether th e benefit of having the \"peace of mind\" of CWD coverage outweighs the cost of required premiums. For t hose with higher incomes, their cost-benefit determination of enrolling in CWD must take into account their higher premiums. The California Working Disabled Program: Lessons Learned, Looking Ahead 25 Movement into and out of CWD Table 12 indicates that 915 people were enrolled in CWD at some point between June 2001 and October 2002. Given that current CWD enrollm ent is approximately 650 people, 265 people have disenrolled from the program. Approximate ly four percent of CW D enrollees leave the program in a given month\u2014a figure that closely matches typical Medicaid disenrollment rates for the Temporary Assistance for Needy Fa milies (TANF) population. The CWD Program's disenrollment rate is therefore not uncommon in a Medi-Cal envir onment\u2014particularly in an aid category where monthly premiums are required. Table 12. CWD Claims Cost Distributio n by Enrollee (June 2001-October 2002) Individual Claims Costs # CWD Enrollees, This Corridor Percentage of Enrollees Total Claims Costs, This Corridor Percentage of Claims < $100 produced by DHS. Using DHS data, an analysis of the source of entry and exit fo r those people enrolling or disenrolling from CWD was conduc ted. Table 13 presents the results of three two-month snapshots of the flow of people moving into a nd out of CWD. During th e time periods assessed (May through June 2000, August through Sept ember 2001, and May through June 2002), 132 people enrolled in the CWD Program. Of these new enrollees, 83 (63 percent) were already enrolled in Medi-Cal immediatel y prior to switching to CWD. Thus, the California Working Disabled program was creating a new source of c overage for only 37 percent of enrollees, with the others simply switching aid categories with in Medi-Cal. Most of those switching into CWD left a Medically Needy aid category. Those disenrolling from the California Worki ng Disabled Program during the time period analyzed exhibited a similar patte rn\u2014staying in Medi-Cal but switc hing aid categories. Of the 54 disenrollees, 37 (69 percent) switched to another Medi-Cal aid category, a nd 17 (31 percent) left the Medi-Cal program altogether. Most of thos e switching aid categories went into a Medically Needy aid category. It was beyond the scope of th is study to research the reasons causing people to disenroll from CWD; however, several reasons are plausible a nd warrant further investigation. Some individuals may have been involuntarily disenrolled because they failed to pay their premiums or experienced other ch anges in their eligibility such as no longer being employed or having income in excess of CWD limits. Others ma y have chosen to disenroll because they did 26 The California Working Disabled Program: Lessons Learned, Looking Ahead not want to pay monthly premiums and preferred paying a share of cost in the Medically Needy Medi-Cal Program, or because they chose not to work. Some individuals may have access to health coverage through an employer and droppe d their CWD coverage although they are still eligible for coverage. Table 13.

The California Working Disabled Program: Lessons Learned, Looking Ahead 27 III. Modeling of Alternative Policy Options Data from SIPP and DHS were analyzed to quan tify the enrollment and co st effects of expanding eligibility for CWD. Specifically, three options for expanding CWD eligibility were considered: 1. raising the income eligibility to 450 percent of FPL; 2. eliminating the asset test; and 3. raising the income eligibility to 450 percent of FPL and eliminating th e asset test (options 1 and 2 combined). Raising Income Eligibility to 450 Percent of FPL The number of uninsured working disabled Californians in the income threshold of 250 to 450 percent of FPL, as extrapolated from the SIPP, is summarized in Table 14, which also indicates the degree to which these people's monetary a ssets exceed current Medi-Cal eligibility thresholds of $2,000 for an individual and $3,000 fo r a couple. Raising the income threshold for the California Working Disabled Program would clearly create a new pool of potentially eligible individuals\u2014this subgroup would include 5,88 5 people (counting only uninsured people and excluding those with private coverage and thos e already enrolled in Me di-Cal), based on the SIPP responses. Table 14.

Note: Monetary assets include checking/savings accounts, stocks, bonds, and retirement accounts. 28 The California Working Disabled Program: Lessons Learned, Looking Ahead The rate at which uninsured pe ople are joining the CWD Program is extremely modest. While there are an estimated 141,461 uninsured workin g disabled Californian s under 250 percent of FPL (based on a net countable income simulation in the SIPP data) with assets below the current CWD eligibility threshol d, only 652 people had enrolled as of June 2002. Moreover, 63 percent of the CWD enrollees simply switched Medi-Cal aid codes\u2014they were not uninsured. It is estimated that only 241 people have joined CW D from outside the Medi-Cal program. This represents a take-up rate of 0.17 percent among the program's target population of uninsured workers with disabilities and net countabl e income less than 250 percent of FPL. It should be noted that while there are about 650,000 privatel y covered working disabled Californians in this income cohort, it seems un likely that these people would drop their private coverage in favor of Medi-Cal coverage\u2014particularly in an ai d code where a monthly enrollee premium is required. Medi-Cal offers certain be nefits such as prescription drugs and durable medical equipment beyond coverage levels of most private coverage, crea ting some incentive to drop private coverage in favor of Medi-Cal. However, there is no evidence to date that such \"crowd-out\" of private coverage ha s occurred to a significant ex tent in CWD, and therefore no reason to expect that it will occur. Thus, the take-up rate calculation is based only on the uninsured population. Table 15 estimates net enrollment and cost impacts of raising the CWD income eligibility threshold to 450 percent of FPL without other changes being made to the program or the implementation of new outreach efforts. This modeling does not account for movement into CWD from other forms of coverage including Medi-Cal or private coverage. It is assumed that new enrollees will largely be people who are dually eligible for Medicare, as is the case with existing CWD enrollees. While 5,885 uninsured wo rking disabled people would seemingly become eligible for the CWD Program, a take-up ra te of 0.17 percent woul d result in a Medi-Cal net enrollment gain of only 10 people. Based on an estimate that these individuals' claims costs would average $6,000 per year, which closely a pproximates the current enrollees' per capita claims costs, the annual claims cost estimate fo r raising the income threshold to 450 percent is $60,000. However, the monthly premiums for people above 250 percent of FPL would be at least $250 under the CWD Program's current sliding scal e. The net result of applying these premium payments against the claims costs is overall program costs of $3,000 per new enrollee per year, or $30,000 for the projected 10 new enrollees. Note that these program costs will increase substantially if the current take-up rate of 0.17 percent is exceeded. For example, a take-up rate of one percent, which is still quite modest in the context of most Medi-Cal coverage groups, w ould lead to 59 new people and net costs of $177,000 per year. Increasing the income threshold creates more larg e-scale financial risk to Medi-Cal, as much larger numbers of people could en roll. However, the current take- up rate would need to increase a hundredfold for the net enrollment impact to reach even 1,000 people. The California Working Disabled Program: Lessons Learned, Looking Ahead 29 Table 15.

Eliminating the Asset Test Another option for promoting enrollment into CWD would be to remove the asset test for this subgroup. As shown earlier in Table 14, SIPP estimates that approximately 80,000 uninsured, working disabled Californians are not currently eligible for CWD due to their assets\u2014those with incomes below 250 percent of FPL and assets above current Medi -Cal thresholds. Table 16 develops enrollment and cost esti mates for the CWD Program associated with elimination of the asset test. A pplying the previously derived cu rrent take-up rate of 0.17 percent to the population of uninsured working disabled people with assets above current program qualifying thresholds yields a net Medi-Cal enro llment increase of 136 people. Using an annual cost per person estimate of $6,000, overall annua l net additional medical costs of $816,000 are projected if the CWD asset test were complete ly eliminated. An assumed average monthly CWD premium for these enrollees ($50) results in offsetting premium payments of $81,600 across the 136 enrollees. Net annual program costs would therefore be $734,400. Again, to illustrate the impact of higher take-up rates, new enrollment and annual medical costs were calculated at a take-up rate of one percent. At this take-up rate, the net enro llment increase would total 799 new people, with net program costs totaling $4.3 million. 30 The California Working Disabled Program: Lessons Learned, Looking Ahead Table 16. Estimated Cost of Eliminat ing Asset Test for CWD Population Derivation Comments Current Take-Up Rate Take-up rate among people who are both income-eligible and asset-eligible 0.17% Derived in previous table Enrollment Estimate Uninsured working disabled Californians, below 25% of FPL (net countable) with assets above current Medi-Cal threshold 79,947 Derived from SIPP Additional CWD Enrollees below 250% (who aren't already on Medi-Cal) 136 Applies current take-up rate (0.0017) to target population (79,947) Cost Estimate Estimated average annual medical costs per person $6,000 Approximate average level of existing CWD enrollees' claims Estimated annual premiums paid per new enrollee $600 Multiplies assumed monthly premium ($50) by 12 Estimated additional annual medical costs $734,400 136 people x ($6,000 - $600) Note that another policy option, in lieu of complete elimination of the asset test, would be to increase the allowed asset threshold. Several stat es have chosen to allow asset levels above California's current levels. Given th at elimination of the asset test is projected to have a modest impact, raising the threshold from, for example, $3,000 to $10,000 will have a minimal impact on program enrollment. The SIPP data indicates that nearly half (44.9 percent) of California's 50,783 uninsured working disabled people who are ine ligible due to excess assets have assets in the $3,000 to $10,000 corridor. Thus, a policy op tion of increasing CWD's allowed asset threshold to $10,000 could create ro ughly half the enrollment and cost impact of completely eliminating the CWD asset test. The exact estimate of this policy change would be an enrollment increase of 61 people at an annual medical cost of $366,000 and a net program cost (after subtracting premium payments) of $329,400. Another option for modifying the asset test is allo wing enrolled individuals to accumulate assets beyond the limits established for determining eligib ility. Under this option a state could retain its current asset eligibility standards, but estab lish new, higher standards for asset accumulation subsequent to enrolling in the Medicaid Buy-In program, or decide not to implement an upper asset limit at all. This option would permit enro lled people to save to the maximum extent possible once enrolled. Some states are im plementing \"independence\" or other approved accounts in which enrolled people can save for goods or services to enhance their independence, without those accounts applying to the asset limit. For example, Vermont permits people enrolled in its Medicaid Buy-In program to keep liquid assets accumulated on or after January 1, 2000, in a separate account without being counted toward the asset limit. 28 Modeling these options was not conducted in this study; however , the cost and enrollment impacts of such changes warrant further investigation. The California Working Disabled Program: Lessons Learned, Looking Ahead 31 Raising Income Eligibility to 450 Percent of FPL and Eliminating the Asset Test The two policy components describe d earlier are additive in that the additional enrollees from raising the income threshold (without changing the asset test) are an entire ly separate group from those who would join if the income threshold were kept at 250 percent of FPL but the asset test were eliminated. However, these two changes in combination would also cr eate a third source of potential enrollment\u2014making worki ng disabled people eligible fo r CWD who have assets above current CWD thresholds and with net countable incomes between 250 percen t and 450 percent of FPL. The size of this target population is 25,390 uninsured people as derived by SIPP (see Table 14). Applying the current CWD take-up rate of 0.17 percent to this s ubgroup would result in 43 additional enrollees. Table 17 summarizes the results of the three expans ion options explored in this paper and shows the resulting enrollment and cost impacts of ma king both changes to the CWD eligibility rules. The combined estimate is a net increase in Medi-Cal enrollment of 189 people at an annual medical cost of $1.1 million and a net program cost (after subtracting enrollee premium payments) of $893,400. While these are not the only policy options for broadening the pool of potential enrollees, these closely match the options explored in the orig inal language of AB 925. Table 17.

One proposal would decrease eligibility for the Medi-Cal Aged and Disabled Program from its current level of 133 percent of FPL to 100 percent of FPL, whic h is projected to save the state $127.6 million.29 Another effect of this proposal might be to increase CWD enrollment if those losing Aged and Disabled Medi-Cal eligibility both work and ar e willing to pay CWD premiums (which for this population would range from $50 to $75 per month).30 Individuals affected by this proposal also could retain Medi-Cal through a Medically Needy aid category, but would be responsible for paying a monthly share of cost, which would most likely be greater than the amount of a monthly premium. Thus, individuals could choose to enroll in the program that th ey believe will provide the greatest benefit relative to the cost and risk s of enrolling. This will be further discussed later in this report. The California Working Disabled Program: Lessons Learned, Looking Ahead 33 IV. Enrollee Survey Information gathered from CWD enrollees is critical to underst anding CWD's overall performance. The CWD enrollee survey was de signed to answer specific questions about respondents' experiences with va rious aspects of the program, given an individual's unique circumstances. Survey respondents addressed issues such as: types of disabilities; workforce participation while enrolled in CWD; access to health care coverage prior to and after joining CWD; factors that influenced the decision to enroll in CWD; sources of CWD information; and overall satisfaction with the program. In addition to the information gathered from the survey, several respondents agreed to participate in follow-up interviews and to share their stories, which are included in this chapter of the report. Characteristics of Respondents Survey respondents were demographically well matched with the overall CWD population. Both the survey respondents and the broader CWD enrollee population were made up of about 80 percent whites. Females were somewhat over-repr esented in the survey, comprising 60 percent of the respondents as compared to 48 percent of the ove rall CWD enrollees. Respondents were asked to describe their disabilities, which were then categorized according to Social Security disability classifications. More than 40 percent of respondents reported having mental disorders,31 the most common disability category among respondents, followed by neurological and musculoskeletal disabilities. Ta ble 18 provides a more detailed distribution of reported disabilities. Twenty-seven respondents had more than a single impairment, the majority of whom reported \"mental disorder s\" as one of their impairments. Data from the Social Security 34 The California Working Disabled Program: Lessons Learned, Looking Ahead Administration show that the most common di agnosis among disabled workers in December 2000 was mental disorders (27.4 pe rcent), followed by musculoske letal diseases (23.2 percent) and circulatory system diseases (10.7 percent).32 Thus, individuals with mental disorders were slightly overrepresented am ong CWD survey respondents. Table 18. Distribution of Disabili ties among Survey Respondents Disabling Condition(s)* Number of Respondents Percentage Mental disorders 61 41% Neurological 28 19% Musculoskeletal 25 17% Immune 3% Respiratory 5 3 2% Multiple body systems 3 2% Neoplastic diseases 3 2% Special senses & speech 1 1% Hemic & lymphatic 0 0% Skin 0 0% Unclear 5 3% * Survey respondents self-reported their impairments and were grouped in accordance with the SSA-defined \"Listing of Impairments-Adult.\" Percentages add up to greater than 100% due to some respondents reporting multiple conditions. Workforce Participation Hours of Work Table 19 describes the weekly work hours of respondents. The majority of respondents (71 percent) worked 20 hours or less per week. Of that 71 percent, 60 percent worked between 10 and 20 hours a week. During follow-up phone intervie ws, interviewees were asked what factors influenced the number of hours they currently wor k. Health conditions prev ented more than half of interviewees from being able to work more ho urs; and for nearly one th ird of interviewees, the number of work hours was limited by the amount of work available or the temporary or seasonal nature of the job. Six individuals interviewed limited their work hours to keep their income within program limits. The California Working Disabled Program: Lessons Learned, Looking Ahead 35 \"Having Medi-Cal is like having peace of mind. For me it's worth it to pay the premium to know that Medi-Cal will pay for what Medicare does not.\" \u2014CWD Enrollee Table 19. Number of Work Hours per Week Current Number of Work Hours Hours of Work If No Income Limit Weekly Hours Respondents Percentage Respondents Percentage None 10 6% 14 9% 1-10 hours 46 19% 30-40 hours 17 10% 32 20% Six percent of respondents were not working, wh ich would make them ineligible for CWD. During follow-up phone calls, some interviewees repor ted a recent lay-off or an inability to work at the current time due to a health condition, although techni cally they remain employed. Under Medi-Cal policy, eligibility is redetermined ever y 12 months, but enrollees are required to report changes in eligibility status ev en if they occur before the re determination. Individuals who are enrolled in CWD but are not work ing have probably not reported the change in their eligibility status. For others, the number of hours worked per week fluctuated, depending both on their health status and the amount of work available through their employer. During particularly slow periods, there may be little or no work for the enrollee even though he or she is still employed. Follow-up interviewees suggested that the program implement special provisions to address tem porary lapses in work that are beyond the enrollee's control. Se veral interviewees noted the irony of a program charging a monthly premium to a working individual with disabilities that is lower than the monthly share of cost charged disabled i ndividuals who are not working. Many thought that individuals w ho are laid off from jobs or who are unable to work during temporary flar e-ups of their condition should retain CWD coverage for a longer period of time than is curr ently allowed. Most were unaware of the CWD policy providing two months of continuing cove rage when loss of employment is due to good cause. Several survey respondents also commented that finding employment in the first place could be difficult and believed that helping di sabled individuals find jobs would improve the program. Table 20 shows that respondents generally indicate d that they would work more hours each week if there were no income eligib ility limit for the program. Eight y-four respondents would work 20 or fewer hours, and 62 respondents would work mo re than 20 hours each week if they did not have to limit their earnings. Fourteen people would not work at all. Some of the latter work just to keep their CWD coverage because they do not have access to other coverage or because their share of cost in another Medi-Cal aid category is hi gher than they can afford. Slightly over one-third of respondents indicated that knowing they would be eligible for CWD did influence their decision to go to work. For most respondents, however, enrolling in CWD did not change how much they worked. About twice as many individuals (17) work more hours than 36 The California Working Disabled Program: Lessons Learned, Looking Ahead work fewer hours (8) as a result of enrolling in the CWD Program. It is possible that those who work fewer hours do so in order stay within th e income eligibility limits for CWD. Some individuals indicated that over time, they have been promoted at work and that those promotions were accompanied by an increase in their wage or salary. However, they have had to either forgo the raise or decrease their work hours to stay within CWD earnings limits. Others who also receive SSDI payments may limit their work hours to stay within the SGA limit (currently $780 per month). Individuals working at or above the SGA lose eligib ility for SSDI benefits, which could significantly reduce their total monthly income if thei r earned income is insufficient to make up for the lost SSDI payment. Size of Employer As shown in Table 20, most respondents worked for employers with less than 100 employees. Seventy-five percent of respondents worked fo r employers with less than 25 employees. Some follow-up interviewees stated that because they n eeded to be working to be eligible for CWD, they asked a friend or church to \"employ\" them by paying them for servi ces rendered, even if they were just to be paid for a few hours of work each week. Thus, some of the individuals who indicated that they work by themselves are not technically self-employed. Rather, they might be describing a work environment in which their work tasks are completed without the presence of other employees. Table 20.

Two interviewees started their own businesses, turning hobbies into work. Both work from their homes. One began her business in orde r to qualify for CWD, wh ile the other, who was already enrolled, began her business to retain her CWD eligibility after she was laid off. Health Insurance Coverage Table 21 presents the health insurance coverage of survey respondents prior to joining CWD, as well as any additional coverage they had as CWD enrollees. Fourteen percent of respondents were uninsured prior to havi ng CWD coverage. Similar numbers of respondents had only Medi- Cal (33) or only Medicare (29) prior to enrollin g in CWD, and 48 respondents (30 percent) had both types of coverage. Sixteen percent of respo ndents had private coverage, paid for either out of pocket or by a family member; or they were covered through their em ployer before enrolling in CWD. Additional information provided by respondents who purchased private coverage The California Working Disabled Program: Lessons Learned, Looking Ahead 37 suggests that some of those res pondents were actually referring to Medicare coverage for which they pay monthly premiums. Of the 16 respondent s with private covera ge, nine had health coverage through their employer. Table 21. Health Insurance Coverage of Respondents Prior to CWD Coverage With CWD Coverage Respondents Percentage Respondents Percentage Medi-Cal only 33 20% 24 15% Dually eligible 48 30% 123 76% Private coverage 26 16% 15 9% Uninsured 23 14% 0 0 Medicare, non-dual 29 18% 0 0 County 3 2% 0 0 Enrollees were asked about what other health co verage they had in addi tion to CWD at the time of the survey. Respondents with Medicare covera ge totaled 123 (46 more than those who had Medicare prior to enrolling in CWD). CWD was the only source of health care coverage for 15 percent of respondents. Among the nine percent w ho have private coverage in addition to CWD, just four respondents (three percent) had health coverage through their employer in addition to being enrolled in CWD. The overa ll rate of private coverage d ecreased slightly from 16 percent to nine percent once responde nts gained CWD coverage As shown in Table 22, a majority of respondents (76 percent) did not ha ve access to employer- sponsored coverage, in most cases because their em ployer did not offer it at all or because they were ineligible as part-time or temporary em ployees. Some respondents were not eligible for employer-sponsored coverage because they were not currently working. Fewer than five percent of respondents were also enrolled in insurance coverage provided by their employers; a similar number had access to employer-sponsored coverage, but chose not to enroll. The lack of employer-sponsored health coverage is not surprising given that most respondents work less than 20 hours per week. Part-time work ers are typically not eligible for employer- sponsored health coverage. One recent survey fo und that only two out of five part-time workers are eligible for health plans offered by their employers to full-time workers.33 Part-time workers and self-employed workers are more likely to be uninsured than full-time workers. The same survey showed that 26 percent of part-time and 35 percent of self-employed workers were uninsured, in comparison to 21 percent of full-tim e workers. Moreover, most survey respondents work at small businesses with less than 25 employees. The smaller the business enterprise, the greater the likelihood that health coverage is not offered to the workers. A California HealthCare Foundation-funded survey of California employers found that 89 percent of employers with 25 to 50 employees offered coverage to full-time employees. This percentage drops to 82 percent for firms with 10 to 24 employees and to 64 pe rcent for firms with two to nine employees. 34 38 The California Working Disabled Program: Lessons Learned, Looking Ahead Table 22. CWD Enrollees with Access to Employer-Sponsored Coverage Access to Employer- Sponsored Coverage Respondents Percentage Not currently working 18 12% Employer does not offer health insurance 63 40% Not eligible for insurance through work 56 36% Enrolled 6 4% Choose not to enroll 6 4% Not sure 7 4% The Decision to Enroll Respondents were asked to rate th e importance of selected factors in their decision to enroll in CWD. Responses to this rating que stion were then categorized by re spondents' coverage prior to enrolling in CWD, as shown in Table 23. Most respondents in all coverage groups ranked each factor as \"somewhat\" to \"very\" important in their decision to enroll. This trend suggests that there is no single most influentia l component of the program, but that the decision to enroll in this program is based on a confluence of factors. Among respondents who had either private coverage or some other form of Medi-Cal coverage prior to enrolling in CWD, more than 80 percent indicated that lower monthly costs were very important in their decision to en roll. Seventy-two per cent of dually eligible and 75 percent of uninsured individuals responded the same way. Among individuals who previously were insured privately, 92 percent said that the ability to wo rk and keep their Medi-Cal coverage was very important in their decision. The most important f actor in uninsured indivi duals' decision to enroll in CWD was that they had no other available coverage. Sources of Information That Led Enrollees to CWD Table 24 summarizes the respondents' sources of information about the CWD Program. County eligibility workers were most often the key sour ce of information; n early 60 percent of all respondents heard about CWD fr om an eligibility worker. Overall, community-based organizations (CBOs), such as those providi ng community benefits counseling or planning services, were the second most common sour ce, with 20 percent of respondents identifying community-based organizations as their source for information. The l east common source of information among all previous c overage groups was employers. While eligibility workers were the primary s ource of information about the program for all respondents, respondents also got information from eligibility workers. Some follow-up interviewees indicated that eligibility worker s did not actively provide information on CWD or suggest the program until the enrollee requested info rmation. Interviewees also stated that when The California Working Disabled Program: Lessons Learned, Looking Ahead 39 Table 23.

Interviewees often had to make multiple attempts to obtain inform ation about CWD, speaking with one eligibility worker after another until finding one who knew enough about the program to begin the eligibility determination process. This observatio n by survey interviewees was consistent with those of the county eligibility workers. Several respondents had little or no understanding of the program even once they were enrolled; some indicated that they were \"switched\" into the program by an eligibility worker who did not provide any other information about the program . Respondents experienced difficulty obtaining various types of needed information, including: program benefits, such as covere d services and coverage limitations; eligibility requirements; enrollee responsibilities; and differences between CWD and other Medi-Cal coverage categories. Asset Limits The current CWD asset and re source limit is $2,000 for indi viduals and $3,000 for couples. Assets are defined as income, savings or check ing accounts, investments, or property. As shown in Table 25, most respondents did no t have to eliminate or limit their assets in order to enroll in CWD. Income and savings or checking accounts were more often eliminated or limited than were investments or property. The fewest number of respondents indicated that property was the asset they had to eliminate or limit. The California Working Disabled Program: Lessons Learned, Looking Ahead 41 Table 25. Respondents Eliminating Assets in Order to Enroll in Medi-Cal Yes No Income 18% who did not redu ce assets, most (19 respondents) did not even have assets prior to enrolling in the program. Some interviewees were enrolled in Medi-Cal (through another aid category) prior to enrolling in CWD and therefore their assets were already within the permissible limits. For others, whatever assets they had were spent to cover their health care costs before they applied for CWD enrollment. Personal Assistant Services The enrollee survey included que stions regarding the use of pe rsonal assistant services (PAS) and whether providing PAS in the workplace would enable greater workforce participation. Most survey respondents did not use personal assistan t services (PAS), but of the 20 individuals who did, six also used PAS at work. Follow-up interviewees who did not use PAS stated that they did not require PAS at the time. Some interviewees could not afford an assistant and some were unaware of programs that provided assistance with PAS. For those respondents using PAS, services were most often either obtained through the In-Home Supportive Services (IHSS) program or paid for out of pocket. Individuals paid from $12 to $225 per week out of pocket for PAS. The next mo st common sources of payment for PAS were family members or friends. Most respondents who use PAS would not in crease their workforce participation if they could use PAS at work. Enrollee Satisfaction Areas of Satisfaction Table 26 summarizes respondents' overall leve ls of satisfaction w ith the CWD Program. Respondents are highly satisfied with CWD, regardle ss of what their coverage status was prior to joining the program. No one who was previously uninsured or who had either Medi-Cal or Medicare coverage was \"not satisfi ed at all.\" Sixty-one percent of individuals who were privately covered prior to enrolling in CWD were \"very satisfied\" with the program. Those previously covered privately also had the hi ghest rate (four per cent) of being \"not satisfied at all.\" Satisfaction with the CWD Program was simila r for both men and women, with 68 percent of both men and women being \"very satisfied\" with the program. Seven percent of women and 11 percent of men were \"somewhat unsatisfied\" or \"not satisfied at al l\" (data not shown). 42 The California Working Disabled Program: Lessons Learned, Looking Ahead Table 26. Enrollee Satisfaction Level by Type of Coverage Prior to CWD Prior Coverage Not Satisfied at All Somewhat Unsatisfied Not Sure Somewhat Satisfied Very Satisfied Respondents who use personal assist ant services also reported a high level of satisfaction with the program. More than three qua rters of respondents who use pers onal assistant se rvices either at home or at work were \"somewhat\" or \"very satisfied\" with the program, and no one within this subgroup expressed dissatisfaction with the program (data not shown). Follow-up interviewees were asked about their satisfaction with specif ic aspects of CWD. Interviewees were most satisfied with the re asonableness of premium payments, followed by the quality of care received. Eligibility workers won praise from some responde nts. One interviewee stated that once he was able to identify an eligibility worker aware of the program, that worker was very helpful in processing his application. Others noted that they would not have found out about the program if their worker had not provided them with program information. Areas of Dissatisfaction Respondents are highly satisfied with the program overall; however, in follow-up interviews they did identify some areas that had caused them diffic ulty. Interviewees were most dissatisfied with their ability to obtain needed in formation and the enrollment process. Almost one-half expressed dissatisfaction with their ability to get needed in formation and nearly one- third were dissatisfied with the enrollment process (data not shown). Ma ny interviewees and respondents indicated that they experienced difficulty reaching their eligibi lity worker when they had questions, and that their phone calls or other correspondence often went unreturned or unanswered. Respondents also expressed concern with the benefits covered. Respondents want expanded access to pharmaceuticals and were frustrated with the monthly limit on the number of prescriptions they can fill without submitting a treat ment authorization request (TAR), especially when those drugs are often part of ongoing tr eatment regimens. Other respondents took issue with the Medi-Cal drug formulary, stating that al l drugs should be available to all Medi-Cal enrollees, especially those with disabilities. E xpanding the type and amount of covered services was also identified as a needed improvement to the program. In particular, several respondents cited a need for more de ntal and vision coverage. Survey respondents experienced difficulty findi ng a provider who accepts Medi-Cal. In many cases, respondents were not able to find conveniently located pr oviders, and some travel up to The California Working Disabled Program: Lessons Learned, Looking Ahead 43 \"Without this program, costs would be so high it would be impossible for me to live because my medicine costs alone are $1,000 a month. I thank God every day for this program.\" \u2014CWD Enrollee two hours to the nearest provide r accepting Medi-Cal. Several re spondents demonstrated their awareness of provider reimbursement rates in Medicaid by stating th at they believed low provider reimbursements made accepting Medi-Cal unappealing to providers, leading to their own difficulty in finding providers. Many respondents were also frustrated with th e premium payment system in which DHS is to supply enrollees with premium payment envelopes, stating that they were not receiving the envelopes in a timely manner.35 As a result, some respondents forgot to pay premiums at all or premium payments were late. These individuals were concerned that they would lose their coverage if their premium payments were late and stated that they rely on the enve lopes to serve as a reminder to send payment. Most of the issues cited above by survey respondents as areas in which they experienced some dissatisfaction warrant clarification. The issu es raised by respondents and interviewees\u2014specifically, c oncerns with limitations in certain benefits, difficulty finding providers that accept Medi-Cal, and dissatisfaction with the enrollment process\u2014are not unique to the CWD Program. Rather, these concerns are consistent with those that have been raised over time by enrollees, policymakers, and advocates about the Medi-Cal program in general. It is beyond the scope of this study to examine these issues furthe r. However, the repeated identification of these areas of concern warrants fu rther study and investigation. Stories from Enrollees Several of those interviewed in follow-up to the en rollee survey shared experiences illustrative of the real-life choices and challenge s working individuals with disabi lities confront. Several of the respondents' situations are descri bed below. These stories demonstr ate the benefits and ironies of the policies governing CWD, including those that create work disinc entives rather than incentives. These stories demonstrate that CWD en rollees are diverse in many ways, including in their demographic characteristics, level of need for health care services, need for assistance at home or at work, and the work-related issues they face. The value enrollees place on CWD emerges in their stories, as do their frustra tions in obtaining needed information and the challenges they face in navigating multiple pub lic benefit programs and private insurance. Enrollees must carefully weigh th eir options for benefits and of ten are placed in the tenuous position of having to choose one program over a nother. Enrollee names have been changed to protect their confidentiall y, but their circumstances have not been altered. 44 The California Working Disabled Program: Lessons Learned, Looking Ahead \"If it wasn't for the California Working Disabled Program, I would not be able to work. Increas[ing] the income limits [would improve the program]. I just got a promotion where I was offered more than $42,000 per year. I took the promotion, but I asked not to be paid more than $41,500.\" \"Not a lot of people know about this program. In business, the filtering of information is primary, and in this program, a lot of information is not being disseminated.\" Michael Age: 33 yrs. old Employment: Managerial, 35 hours/week Disabling Condition(s): Quadriplegic Michael became a quadriplegic after suffering a spinal cord injury and uses a wheelch air and help from a personal assistant. He was lucky because his family could help either by providing personal assistant services themselves or by paying for services. After completing coll ege Michael began working and did not apply for Medi-Cal or other benefits. When he was informed that his personal assistant, a family member, could no longer continue helping him, Michael re alized that he needed help finding and paying for his personal care servi ces, which would cost him about $1,700 per month. His employment- based health insurance covered most of his medical expenses but did not pay for personal assistant services. In June 2000, Michael applied for CWD so that he could access the In-Home Supportive Services program, which would help him with his personal care needs. When he first inquired about CWD, Michael was told that the program did not exist, but he persisted and was eventually approved for coverage two months later. Since then he has been enrolled in CWD, accessing IHSS services through Medi-Cal and using his em ployer-sponsored coverage for other medical services. Michael is very happy with CWD and is grateful for the personal assistan t services he receives through IHSS. However, he cites the program's in come limits as a majo r restriction. Michael currently earns about $41,500 annually, which, after all permissible exemptions and reductions, puts him at the upper limit of eligibility. Over th e last couple of years, he has been offered several significant pay raises and promotions . While he can accept th e promotions, taking on additional work responsibilities, including a managerial role, he has had to decline raises in order to keep his eligibility for CWD. He reports ha ving to turn down one position that would have paid him approximately $60,000 annually. Robert Age: 49 years old Employment: Consultant, 1-10 hours/week Disabling Condition(s): Liver cancer Before getting liver cancer, Robert was employed as a corporate executive, earning about $275,000 annua lly. Now, he is too sick to work full time, but feels lucky enough to ge t paid for doing some consulting work for his church, a job that is flexible enough to accommodat e his health condition. After struggling with a $1,200 monthly share of cost for Medically Needy Medi-Cal and speaking with four different eligibility workers and one supervisor, he enrolled in CWD. Before Robert enrolled in Medi-Cal, he exhausted his COBRA covera ge with his former employer and spent his savings and retirement funds to pay for his health care. He st ates that he has always worked and because he never needed to apply for benefits before, he di d not know what programs we re available. Robert states that the share of cost he was paying before enrolli ng in CWD was too high, and even The California Working Disabled Program: Lessons Learned, Looking Ahead 45 \"I was a social worker for 18-20 years and could advocate for myself.\" \"Provisions to cover a person if they become unemployed due to layoffs or business cutbacks [would make the program better]. Something like four to six months of coverage after the layoff...\" though his SSDI income was relatively high, he was only left with $600 every month. He spoke with several eligibility workers about lowering hi s share of cost, but no one had any options for him. Finally, he spoke with one worker who onl y vaguely knew about CWD, but was able to get the application process started. Robert is awaiting transp lant surgery and he plans to go back to work full time once he is fully recovered. Until that time, he plans to go back to work gradually to ensure that his income stays within SSDI and CWD eligibility limits. Robert is highly satisfied with the CWD Program although he did not find information as readily as he would have liked, and he had to submit his paperwork a second time after his original submission was lost. He states that there needs to be standardization in the information that is being shared by eligibility work ers, referring to his experience speaking with three different eligibility workers and a supervisor before sp eaking to a person who wa s aware of the program. Robert suggests that people \"who have not been in the system,\" or individuals who have never collected state benefits, do not know about the program. Robert sa ys, \"I cannot be the only one who has worked his entire life and had a catastrop hic illness that made him unable to work [in his existing job].\" Mary Age: 10-20 hours/week Disabling Condition(s): Paraplegia, spinal cord injury Before being laid off, Mary was eligible for her employer's health insurance plan, but she says she would have had to pay a $500 monthly premium, more than 60 percent of her monthly $800 salary. Instead, she enrolled in CWD and is very pleased with her coverage. Mary was recently laid off from her part-time job, but was told that her company would rehire her in December 2002. Mary was very concerned about retaining her CWD coverage, knowing that she had to be working to stay eligible. She did not want to accept other employment because she knew that in December, she would be working agai n for her former employer. In order to keep her CWD coverage, Mary applied for and obtaine d a business license, and turned a hobby into a business. Mary has experienced some diff iculty finding providers. She is very pleased with her primary care provider, but reports that finding specialists and dentists who accept Medi-Cal coverage has been difficult. She currently drives an hour and a half each way to see her specialist. Mary initially learned of CWD through independen t Internet research an d by reading the Social Security Handbook. She contacted the Department of Social Services for additional information, and they referred her to Medi-Cal. When she called Medi-Cal, she was referred back to the Department of Social Services. When Mary firs t applied one and a half years ago, she was told that she was ineligible because she earned too much. 46 The California Working Disabled Program: Lessons Learned, Looking Ahead Jane Age: 50 years old Employment: 10 hours/week Disabling Condition(s): Borderline bipolar Jane has been enrolled in Medi-Cal for over 20 years, paying a monthly share of cost over $600. When the CWD Program was implemented, her eligibility worker told he r about it and helped her enroll. Now Jane pays a monthly premium of $20. She is grateful for her Medi-Cal, and says, \"Now I pay $20 and everything Medicare doesn't pay is covered, including my expensive meds!\" However, not all her medications are covered and she still pays $62 out of pocket for some prescriptions. For three prescriptions that Medi-C al did not cover, Jane's doctor filed treatment authorization requests (TAR), which were approve d. Jane could ask her doctor to file a TAR for the other drugs that she currently pays for, but st ates that filing TARs is \"a hassle\" and that she feels badly asking her doctor to do this. Jane says that because her doctor does not get paid very much, she will only ask for TARs for the most expensive medications. Jane says, \"Medi-Cal should make all drugs available if they are the best on the market.\" Jane expressed frustration over some administra tive components of the program. She stated that it seemed like every six months she gets a new e ligibility worker and that each worker advises her differently. She complained that every year, she has to submit documents that were submitted in previous years and that had not changed, such as copies of her Kaiser and Social Security cards; and that after she sends the documentation, she often is as ked to resend it. Jane also complained about how long it take s to process premium payments. Amy Age: 30s Employment: Office worker, part-time Disabling Condition(s): HIV/AIDS Amy has to make the difficult choice between ke eping her part-time job and struggling to make ends meet or quitting her job so she can contin ue to collect her SSDI benefit. Amy currently receives a monthly SSDI paymen t of just over $900 and works part time making approximately $600 per month. She is not eligible for her employer's health benefits. Amy was diagnosed as being HIV positive in 1998 and lost her full-time job following a hospitalization. She struggled fo r two years to obtain SSDI a nd General Assistance (GA) benefits, and during that time she was unable to work. Eventually, Amy began receiving SSDI and GA, and Medi-Cal covered her medical costs. In February 2002, Amy was able to return to work and began working 20 hours a week. Amy re ported her new employment status to Medi- Cal, and as a result, she lost her Medi-Cal coverage. Amy never received notification that her Medi-Cal coverage would be terminated. Instead, she learned of her uninsured stat us at the pharmacy where she was denied coverage for the prescription she was picking up. Amy was able to obtain an emergency s upply of her medication \"I don't know what I would have done without this program. I live in my own condo and I had run up some $60,000 worth of debt because no one can live...in our times on $620 a month. That's [the maintenance need level] Medi-Cal was using when I first became disabled....I went back to work before the 250% program because I wanted to improve myself, but I still only got $620 a month. Everything else went to Medi-Cal.\" The California Working Disabled Program: Lessons Learned, Looking Ahead 47 while she straightened out her coverage situatio n. With the help of a local community-based organization, Amy was eventually able to ge t on a nine-month trial program during which she would receive Medi-Cal coverage with a share of cost and an SSDI check. After the nine-month period she can keep her Medi-Cal coverage, bu t her SSDI payments will end. In exploring her options, Amy learned that she was also eligible for the California Working Disabled Program with a monthly premium. Amy continues to wo rk part-time, but her employer does not offer health coverage to part-time employees. Amy wants to keep working because she feels bett er when she is \"doing something,\" but she is concerned that continuing work di sadvantages her. She is looking fo r a full-time job, but if she is unable to find full-time work and instead rema ins at her current part-time job, her monthly income from earnings would stay at $600\u2014$300 le ss than what she would receive in SSDI payments if she were not working. Amy is willing to pay a premium, but is unsure if she will be able to pay her monthly premium and meet her other financial ob ligations on just her part-time salary. 48 The California Working Disabled Program: Lessons Learned, Looking Ahead V. Nonenrollee Perspectives A small group participated in nonenrollee teleconferences, offeri ng insight into why individuals are not enrolling in the California Working Disa bled Program. Issues that influenced their decision not to enroll in the program include: lack of awareness and information about CWD; discouragement from eligibility workers; and uncertainty in maintaining employment and in deciding between programs. Their insights are consistent with the inform ation shared by both enrollees and eligibility workers. Reaching Nonenrollees Identifying nonenrollee participants for this study was a significant challenge, and the two strategies used to obtain their input yielded only minimal partic ipation. The first attempt was to conduct teleconferences with none nrollees during which a loosel y structured conversation was facilitated. Four teleconference s were scheduled. The teleconference format was chosen because it was believed to be accessible to the greatest number of people without requiring travel and could easily accommodate the schedules of working individuals. The goal for each teleconference was to have fi ve to seven participants w ho would represent California's substantial regional diversity in geog raphy, population, and access to services. The California Work Group on Work Incentives and Health Care (CWG) was asked for its assistance in finding individuals to participate in the teleconferences. 36 A flyer explaining the purpose of and schedule for the teleconferences was distribute d through the CWG network. The flyer also provided a toll-free phone number and email address to c ontact in order to participate. Knowing in advance that identifying the nonenrol lee population would be difficult, this approach for soliciting participation was chosen after cons ulting with the World Institute on Disability (WID), a widely recognized nonprofit researc h, public policy, and advocacy organization headquartered in Oakland. The response to this effort, however, was minimal. Only six The California Working Disabled Program: Lessons Learned, Looking Ahead 49 individuals requested participation in the teleconferences. Of thos e participants, th ree individuals were employees of independent living centers. Following the teleconference attempt, an effort was made to reach nonenrollees for one-on-one interviews. CWG members were contacted and were asked to help identif y individuals who fit the target population and who w ould be willing to be intervie wed for this study. Unfortunately, the results of this effort were also disappoint ing. Most CWG agency re presentatives expressed concern that this population would be very di fficult to find and were unable to identify prospective interviewees. Agency representatives stated that when their agency interacted with individuals, those individuals we re referred to and enrolled in appropriate programs, thereby removing them from the target population. Othe rwise, once a referral was made, no further contact was made unless that indivi dual returned to the agency. Lack of Awareness and Information All teleconference participants cited lack of awareness as the primary reason for nonenrollment in CWD. Many working individuals with disabili ties do not request enrollment in CWD because they do not know that the program exists. One pa rticipant noted that dur ing an informational workshop on programs and services for people with disabilities, most workshop attendees were unaware of the program. Participants were larg ely unaware of outreach activities for CWD, but noted that some independent living center s (ILC) sponsored briefings on the program. Specifically, one participant noted that one ILC hosted an info rmational workshop specifically about the CWD; however, only fi ve individuals attended. Teleconference participants also reported that it was sometimes difficult to obtain information about the program, including from social services. They rema rked that sometimes potential enrollees know more about the program than social services employees. In one case, an individual specifically requested to apply for CWD, but was unable to obtain the correct contact information, and, as a result, her application wa s passed along various ro utes without action. Her application was still pending at the time of th e teleconference. Anothe r participant commented that some people experience so much frustration with \"the system,\" including with other benefits programs, that when they eventually learn of the program, they will not attend informational workshops or apply because of th eir disillusionment. Teleconferen ce participants also discussed a failure on the part of the state to provide indi viduals with \"Ramos packages.\" Ramos packages are letters informing those who lose eligibility for SSI that they ma y still be eligible for Medi-Cal coverage. These packages also describe the pr ocess for requesting an eligibility screening.37 One teleconference participant suggested using a Web-based application for CWD. He thought this would facilitate a more convenient and effici ent application process, noting that applicants are working and may experience difficulty ge tting time off during the day to apply. The participant also suggested that the system could prompt applicants for the supporting documentation they need to send to the social se rvices office to help ensure that applicants provide all necessary information as quickly as possible. Using a Web-based application may in fact facilitate the enro llment of at least a s ubgroup of the CWD target population of working individuals who have Internet access in the wo rkplace but who otherwise would have no or very limited means of accessing the Web. 50 The California Working Disabled Program: Lessons Learned, Looking Ahead Discouragement from Eligibility Workers Teleconference participants reported that so me eligibility workers who are aware of the California Working Disabled Program activel y discourage individuals from enrolling. The eligibility workers advise potential enrollees that the program requi res a monthly premium payment, which they perceive to be more onero us than the share of cost requirement in the Medically Needy Medi-Cal program. Because enro llees in Medically Nee dy aid categories are required to pay a share of cost only in the months they receive health car e services, those with relatively infrequent health care needs may not incur expenditures in some months. If the same individual were enrolled in CW D, he or she would be responsible for making premium payments each month, regardless of whether or not they rece ived health care services. Eligibility workers who discourage enrollment in CWD may believe it is in the financial interest of the enrollees to make payments only when they actually receive services. Eligibility workers confirmed that when an individual is eligible for both CWD a nd the Medically Needy Medi-Cal program, he or she may choose which program to enroll in. Uncertainty One self-employed participant said that uncertainty about future income influenced his decision not to enroll in CWD. This individual is a new small business owner who expressed a strong desire to be enrolled in a program for worki ng individuals. However, because his business was new, he was unsure whether his income would be sufficient to pay monthly premiums. This individual opted for continued enrollment in Medically Needy Medi-Cal until he has developed enough experience with his busine ss to feel secure about a deci sion to enroll in CWD. Another participant stated that some elig ible individuals are wary of public benefit programs, and, in the case of CWD, may be even more so because th ey are unaccustomed to benefits program that required payment for enrollment. The California Working Disabled Program: Lessons Learned, Looking Ahead 51 \"We need more incentives to work and maintain our savings so that we can remain independent. The restrictions on how much checking/savings we can have are confusing and impractical.\" \u2014CWD Enrollee VI. County Eligibility Worker Interviews As demonstrated by both the enrollee survey and the nonenrollee teleconference findings, eligibility workers play a critical role in educ ating and enrolling eligib le individuals in CWD. Eligibility workers interviewed for this project id entified several issues, also raised by enrollees and nonenrollees, that contribute to CWD enrollment trends, including: the asset test burden; lack of CWD outreach and information; and lack of and/or insufficient eligibility worker knowledge. County eligibility workers also suggested that the following f actors contributed to the CWD enrollment trend: strained county resources; other Medi-Cal programs with ve ry similar target populations; and systems issues. The Asset Test Burden Eligibility workers and county staff provided mixed responses when asked whether th e asset test was a barrier to enrollment in the program. Some workers did not think that the asset test was a significant barrier to enrollment and were not aware of denials of eligibility due to asset levels. A county staffer from a large county believed that the asset level did keep certain individuals from being eligible for CWD. Staff in two large counties believed that some individuals do not want to di sclose asset information and therefore choose not to apply, even though they might be eligible. 52 The California Working Disabled Program: Lessons Learned, Looking Ahead Public Outreach and Information Eligibility workers were interviewed and aske d to describe outreach activities conducted to promote CWD. In general, inte rviewees report that the state, counties, or community-based organizations (CBOs) conduct little or no outreac h for CWD. Eligibility workers reported that upon program implementation, the state issued a one -page flyer that provided basic information about the program, including eligibility, cost sh aring, and asset levels; and that directed individuals to counties for more information. On e county long-term care supervisor involved in CWD implementation reported that he received se veral hundred inquiries in response to the DHS flyer. However, most respondents misunderstood the information, thinking that the program was a new cash benefit program, rather than a new option for Medi-Cal coverage. In the initial stages of implementation, the state directed all counties to review their roster of enrollees in share of cost Medi-Cal aid categor ies for their potential eligibility for the CWD Program. Enrollee cases determined to be potentia lly eligible for CWD we re flagged, but there was no requirement to contact enrollees. In mo st cases, individuals who were identified as potentially eligible were not screened until th ey had some other reason for contacting their caseworker or until their redetermination. Ventura County took a particularly proactive approach in reviewing share of cost enrollee cases. Once potentially eligible enrollees in share of cost Medi-Cal programs were identified, the county mailed letters informing them of their pot ential eligibility for a new Medi-Cal program that may have lower cost-sharing requirements. I ndividuals were advised to contact the county to be screened for CWD, and a c ounty eligibility worker then followed up with those who had indicated interest in the program . Of the initial group of individua ls screened in Ventura, most were enrolled in CWD. Th e eligibility worker estimates that si nce that time, about half of those initially enrolled have stayed enrolled in CWD. As a result of their proactive approach to recruitment for CWD, Ventura County has expe rienced some of the hi ghest levels of CWD enrollment seen in a California county. Counties have not pursued outreach targeted specifically at boosting CWD enrollment. Outreach for CWD is more often a component of more general Medi-Cal outreach, such as participating in health fairs, making presentations at CBOs, and sharing information at meetings with other county agencies, such as social serv ices agencies. One eligibility worker reported that her count y chose not to actively promote this program because of the county's lack of resources. In pr evious years, the county had partic ipated in weekend health fairs where general information about Medi-Cal, incl uding CWD, was shared with the community. Health fair participation require d a commitment of staff to work at the fair and the financial resources necessary to pay staff overtime. The c ounty felt it could not promote a program that it could not effectively implement. Specifically, th e county believed it lacked sufficient resources to efficiently respond to a potenti al influx of inquiries or applic ations resulting from an outreach campaign. The interviewee stated that adding more cases to the eligibil ity workers' already burdensome caseloads would cause difficulty. \"If I had known I qualified for this program sooner, it really would have helped me. I was eligible in April 2001, but didn't know until November 2001.\" \u2014CWD Enrollee The California Working Disabled Program: Lessons Learned, Looking Ahead 53 \"...the CWD Program does not impact enough people to warrant its own training...\" \u2014County Medi-Cal \u2014Eligibility Worker Overwhelmingly, eligibility workers stated that the primary obstacle to more robust enrollment in CWD was the lack of program awareness by potential enrollees and by eligibility workers themselves. Eligibility workers report that few, if any, clients request enrollment in the CWD Program and that clients generally are unaware of the program or are otherwise misinformed. According to eligibility workers, many clients belie ve that they are not eligible for the program because they work more than a certain number of hour s or by virtue of the fact that they work at all. Other potential clients believe that if they have other forms of health coverage, they are not eligible for CWD. One e ligibility worker stated that client s do not understand that CWD offers full-scope Medi-Cal benefits, just like other programs for individuals with disabilities. Others are concerned about having to change doctors. Eligib ility workers report that only on rare occasions has a client specifically reque sted screening for CWD. Eligibility Worker Training Training Practices Training for the CWD Program has occurred in mu ch the same way as training for other Medi- Cal programs\u2014through the dissemination of written materials, first from the state to county program and policy offices and then from those county offices to county eligibility units. The State issues \"All County Welfare Directors Letters\" that provide basic program information and subsequent updates regarding bene fits, eligibility, and cost-shari ng requirements. The first \"All County Welfare Directors Letters\" and accompa nying draft procedure manual sections were issued to counties on March 16, 2000, in advance of the program's April 1, 2000, implementation date. \"All County Welfare Director s Letters\" about CWD were also issued on September 27, 2000, and April 17, 2001. The counties' written notices established whethe r the screening procedure for the CWD Program would be centralized or decentr alized. In counties with centra lized eligibility determination, program guidance set forth the procedures for referra ls to appropriate staff for determinations. In a centralized eligibility determination process, all applications are in itially distributed among eligibility workers. If eligibility workers receive an application for an individual who appears to qualify for CWD, they forward the application on to the specialized eligibility worker or unit to make the eligibility determination. Where the official eligibility determination proc ess is centralized, it is still incumbent on all workers to recognize potentially eligible clie nts and make referrals to the specialized work er or unit. Without the initial referral, the eligibility screen ing for this program will not occur. According to eligibility workers interviewed, centralized eligibility systems are used because so few CWD cases appear. County managers be lieve it is more effective to develop program expertise within a core group of speci alized eligibility worker s than it is to train all eligibility workers, as many may never encounter a CWD case. Counties with a decentralized eligibility dete rmination process do not designate specialized eligibility workers. Instead, all eligibility workers make eligibility determinations for all Medi- Cal aid categories. 54 The California Working Disabled Program: Lessons Learned, Looking Ahead Eligibility workers were expected to read the new Medi-Cal manua l sections and begin screening for eligibility in the program. The guidance al so provides instructions for completing required forms, such as SSI/SSP Property Test Worksheet for th e 250 Percent Working Disabled Program (MC 338C) and the Premium Differential Worksheet in the 250 Percent Working Disabled Program (MC 338J). The budget is calculated using the 250 Percent Income Test Worksheet for the 250 Percent Working Disabled Program (MC 338). As with outreach, CWD Program training is in corporated into broa der Medi-Cal training sessions, rather than being offered as a separa te CWD-dedicated traini ng. In some counties, training consisted of supervisors briefing eligib ility workers on new programs. In one county with centralized eligibility determination, the eligibility worker who processed the first CWD case was asked to develop a training outline for elig ibility staff, including technical instructions and background information on the program. Eligibility workers report that they primarily learned about CWD and other programs on their own. Aside from their \"hands on\" experience, el igibility workers received little other training. Some workers in decentralized el igibility counties reporte d that they have been identified as the county's \"CWD expert\" because they were the first worker in their county to process an application for the CWD Program. When other wo rkers have a CWD case, they consult their county \"CWD expert\" for advice as needed. Eligib ility workers often use the earliest cases as examples upon which decisions about new cases are based. Training Shortcomings Eligibility workers commented th at even with the training de scribed above, sometimes they, themselves, are unaware of the CWD Program at all a nd therefore do not screen for eligibility or make referrals for eligibil ity; or they have misconceptions about pe ople with disabilities. Some eligibility workers do not think that many indi viduals with disabilities work, preventing them from informing those interested in returning to work about CWD. Some interviewees reported that workers in their counties, especially new eligibility workers, are of ten overwhelmed with the number of aid categories and cannot recall them all or remember how to process the appropriate application. The perception of difficulty in completing form s and calculating budgets was identified by one eligibility worker as a reason for lack of enrollm ent in CWD. The additional forms that must be completed may also intimidate some eligibility wo rkers, particularly the budget forms. In most counties, budgets are calculated manually and use rules different from other aid categories. Like nonenrollees, some eligibility workers thought th at increased use of automated systems would facilitate eligibility determinations, or at leas t make them simpler. They believed that having a system to prompt eligibility workers about which information to provide would help ensure that enrollees are assessed for appropr iate aid categories, and would be especially useful in budget calculations. One worker shared her belief that some worker s choose to overlook the program to avoid having to complete the forms. Some eligibility worker s report that program regul ations are too complex and the program manual too unclear , making it difficult for eligibility workers to obtain clear, easy-to-understand program information. The majo rity of workers stat ed that eligibility determinations for this program were slightly more difficult or confusing than for other The California Working Disabled Program: Lessons Learned, Looking Ahead 55 programs. Only two workers, one from a central ized and the other from a decentralized county, thought that screening for CWD eligibility pr ocessing is relatively straightforward. Eligibility workers, who are char ged with assessing applicants' el igibility across all Medi-Cal aid categories and enrolling them in the most benefi cial program, are often potential enrollees' only source of program information. When eligibility workers fail to refer applications to the specialized eligibility worker (in the case of coun ties with centralized eligibility determinations), or do not themselves screen the applicants for CWD eligibility, potentially eligible individuals remain unaware of the program. When asked whether additional training would be helpful, eligibility workers provided mixed responses. Some thought additional training woul d be useful if the trainings were ongoing, reinforcing that the program was available and how applications are pr ocessed. Other workers questioned the value of additional training, stating that the informa tion presented at trainings is understood while at or immediatel y following the training, but that it is not always retained because there are few opportunities to use the newly gained information. Moreover, the time necessary to attend a tr aining session is sometime perceived as an additional burden on the eligibility worker's time, especially in this era of increasing state deficits and decreasing administrative budgets. Strained Resources Eligibility workers are responsible for keeping track of all Medi -Cal aid categories and ensuring that applicants are enrolled in the most benefi cial aid category. Current ly, Medi-Cal comprises more than 100 aid categories.38 However, eligibility workers re port that it is difficult to keep current with program changes because changes occu r so frequently. Assessing eligibility for so many programs can be time-consuming, especially since the process is manual. Some workers believe that the CWD Program is considered \"j ust one more program to keep track of.\" In another county, program offi ce staff stated that the caseload of e ligibility workers is so great that they don't have time to complete the lengthy pape rwork to screen for eligibility for all aid categories. Instead, eligibility workers' goal is to get clients enrolled in a program so that clients can access services as soon as possible, rather than having them wait to be screened for all eligibility categories and being enrolled in the most technically correct aid category. Eligibility workers report that pr ogram guidance is confusing, whic h is particularly problematic given that shrinking administra tive budgets and growing caseloa ds are creating pressure to process cases quickly. Eligibility workers might not take the time to read program guidance in order to enroll an individual in CWD when that person receives the same be nefits by enrolling in another aid category more familiar to the eligibil ity workers. Eligibility workers may decide to enroll clients in the aid code fo r which the client is first determined eligible without further investigation of other coverage categories. New e ligibility workers especially may have a harder time remembering the CWD Program simply because they are in the process of learning all aid codes and CWD is relatively uncommon and complex. One interviewee described some elig ibility workers as \"apathetic\" and un willing to make the extra effort to screen for CWD eligibility. Some eligibility workers report that inst ead of screening for eligibility in new aid programs during redetermina tion, individuals are simply re- en rolled in the same program. 56 The California Working Disabled Program: Lessons Learned, Looking Ahead \"Competing\" Aid Categories In two counties, eligibil ity workers thought that other Medi-Cal coverage programs (see Table 1) with eligibility overlapping CWD eligibility \"com peted\" with the CWD Program for enrollees. Eligibility workers are directed also to assess the eligibility of CWD applicants for other aid categories such as the Medically Needy Program to determine which program is the most beneficial to the applicant. Both programs offer full-scope coverage of services, but differ in how net countable income is determined for the pur poses of eligibility and enrollees' financial responsibilities. One major difference in how income is determined is that for CWD, all disability- related income is exempt. The CWD Program re quires individuals to pay monthly premiums using an income-based sliding scale, while in the Medically Needy Pr ogram, individuals are responsible for a share of cost. Eligibility wo rkers are directed to complete budgets for both programs to first determine whether the applicant is eligible for either program and to determine the cost-sharing requirement of both, if any. A pplicants are advised of their eligibility and responsibilities under each program and are perm itted to choose the program that they believe best meets their needs. Some workers reported that individuals who were not familiar with premium payments preferred making share-of-cost payments, a familiar payment scheme. Another worker stated that clients have told her that they did not want to make monthly premium payments for the months in which they would not receive services. However, most en rollees stated that they prefer making monthly premium payments in lieu of share-of-cost paym ents because premiums were significantly less than share-of-cost payments. One county staff person stated that the county's po tential Medi-Cal enroll ees are, for the most part, low-income, and although it ha s actively tried to enroll indivi duals in CWD, most clients are found eligible for A&D. California's Medi -Cal Aged and Disabled Program (A&D) was implemented on January 1, 2001, and provides no-cost Medi-Cal to individua ls aged 65 or older or individuals with disa bilities with incomes up to 100 percent of FPL. In some counties, clients identified as potentially eligible for CWD or who were initially enrolled in CWD were subsequently determined to be eligible for A&D. Systems Issues Some eligibility workers report systems issues in which county systems do not properly interface with the Medi-Cal Eligibility Data System (M EDS) with regard to the CWD Program. Counties operate, maintain, and adjust their own eligib ility systems into which they enter enrollee eligibility data, including aid codes. The inform ation from the county system is interfaced with the MEDS system, which is maintained by the st ate. When interface problems occur, eligibility workers can circumvent them by entering another code, such as the Medically Needy aid code. The result of this practice is an undercount of individuals who enrolled in the CWD program and an overcount of individuals who enrolled in the Medically Needy category. All counties have an assigned MEDS coordinator who assists them wh en issues arise related to interfacing with MEDS. One state Medi-Cal eligibility staff pers on noted that sometimes state staff do encounter errors in coding of enrollee eligibility. The sta ff person did not provide specific reasons for the errors, but stated that when su ch errors are found, the counties are notified and the coding issues are addressed. The California Working Disabled Program: Lessons Learned, Looking Ahead 57 VII. Lessons Learned The CWD Program provides a valuable means of coverage to a target population of working disabled people. The program is intended to faci litate both workplace pa rticipation and health care coverage among disabled Califo rnians with modest incomes. At the same time, the CWD Program currently serves only 650 people, of whom only 189 were previously uninsured\u2014a \"take-up\" rate that repres ents enrollment of less th an one percent of the target population. This final sect ion summarizes the key factors that might contribute to the program's enrollment experience thus far and imp act future efforts to boost enrollment. These factors are listed below. The target population includes an esti mated 150,000 uninsured working individuals. Potential enrollees lack awareness of the program. Eligibility workers lack knowledge, but eff ective training may be difficult to achieve. Little coordination with other ag encies or organizations occurs. Some aspects of the program de tract from its attractiveness. Expanding eligibility rules alone yiel ds only small gains in enrollment. Size of Target Population The CWD Program's modest enrollment to date does not seem to be attributab le to the lack of a sizable eligible target populat ion. Approximately 900,000 disabled pe ople are already enrolled in Medi-Cal. Many of these people might find the CWD Program desirable either in providing a means of returning to the workplace while retaini ng Medi-Cal coverage, or in lowering their out- of-pocket expenses by converting from a share-of -cost coverage category to a monthly premium setting. SIPP indicates that approximately 150,000 disabled Californians are working, have no health coverage, and meet the current CWD program's income and asset eligibility criteria. This 58 The California Working Disabled Program: Lessons Learned, Looking Ahead subgroup seems to be well positione d to benefit from enrolling in CWD. The fact that so few have done so (most CWD enrollees have convert ed from another Medi-Cal aid category) is perhaps the most vexing aspect of th e program's enrollment thus far. Potential Enrollee Awareness Outreach By all accounts\u2014from existing enrollees, county eligibility staff, and other stakeholders interviewed during the project (e.g., DHS and World Institute on Disability staff)\u2014awareness issues have hampered CWD enrollment. The most compelling evidence of the awareness barriers comes from the difficulties many existing CWD en rollees experienced when they asked about the program, and from the extremely low number of people who have joined CWD from outside of Medi-Cal. Little outreach ha s been conducted to encourage enrollment. DHS attempted to promote the CWD Program by disseminating flyers to those already enrolle d in Medically Needy Medi-Cal. However, the state's effort caused conf usion in at least one county where some who received the flyer misunderstood the informa tion presented, and thought that CWD was a cash benefit program rather than health insurance coverage. A portion of the target population of uninsured disabled workers has r eceived some outreach through the activities of the World Institute on Di sability (WID), including promoting CWD in their regular newsletter, posting a CWD Questio n and Answer Guide on their Web site, and convening a work group focusing on work incentives and health coverage programs for people with disabilities. However, WID's efforts have not led to a substantial level of enrollment in CWD. WID itself is a strong proponent of the need for further outreach. If the goal is to boost enrollmen t in the program among those curre ntly eligible, implementing an active outreach campaign with clear information c ould be helpful. Study participants referred to the BabyCal outreach campaign as a model and also suggested public service announcements, bus advertisements, and flyers and posters in locations frequented by potentially eligible individuals. Outreach targeted to potentially e ligible individuals, beyond those who are already enrolled in other Medi-Cal aid categor ies, was particularly encouraged. Program Ramp-Up An important factor to consid er is that CWD was implemente d only 30 months ago. It clearly takes time for a new coverage program to ta ke hold, for eligibility workers to become knowledgeable about the program, and for awar eness to grow among the target population. There are many other relatively new Medi-Cal aid categories w ith fewer than 1,000 enrollees. For example, aid codes 5T, 5Y, 6U, and 7K, whic h provide pregnancy-related coverage, all have fewer than 1,000 enrollees and have been in place for two or more years. Thus, it is possible that the program will soon reach an awar eness threshold at which point word of mouth and eligibility worker familiarity will result in increased enrollment. At the same time, the program's enrollment is inching upwards at an average rate of approximately 20 people per month and does not seem to be on the verge of a larger-scale influx. It is important to consider opportunities to promote the program more successfully\u2014both in getting information out to the potential pool of ap plicants who are not yet enrolled anywhere in The California Working Disabled Program: Lessons Learned, Looking Ahead 59 Medi-Cal and in helping assure that eligibil ity workers are appropriately facilitating the enrollment of CWD-eligible people. One means of quantifying the pot ential enrollment impacts of gr eater county-based awareness efforts is to extrapolate the enrollment expe rience of those counties that have achieved disproportionately high CWD enroll ment levels. The ten counties wi th the greatest proportion of CWD enrollees\u2014relative to their share of statew ide Medi-Cal disabled enrollees\u2014are Contra Costa, Humboldt, Napa, Orange , San Diego, San Luis Obispo, San Mateo, Santa Barbara, Santa Cruz, and Ventura. Those counties collectively acc ount for 19 percent of all disabled Medi-Cal enrollees but account for 58 per cent of CWD enrollees. CWD en rollment across these counties equates to 0.22 percent of their ove rall disabled Medi-Cal enrollment. If this rate were achieved stat ewide in the current program, en rollment would triple to roughly 2,000 people. Such an increase (of about 1,300 people) would of course have cost implications. If the new enrollees' per capita costs are si milar to those of existing CWD enrollees (approximately $6,000 per year), total annual medi cal costs associated with the 1,300 enrollees would be as high as $7.8 million, while total prog ram costs would be $7.0 million (taking into account enrollee premiums paid). These figures a pply only if all the new enrollees are new to Medi-Cal and are not switching from other aid ca tegories. However, if only 37 percent of the additional enrollees were new to Medi-Cal, as in the current CWD Program, total annual medical costs would be much lower\u2014$2.9 million; and tota l program costs would be $2.6 million, taking into account enrollee premiums. Much larger enrollment impacts are likely to accrue if successful efforts are made to broaden awarene ss among currently uninsured disabled workers. The challenge lies in achieving that awareness at an affordable cost , as this target population is not easy to reach. While it is difficult to draw generalizable conc lusions from conversations with eligible but nonenrolled individuals, some important themes emerge. The difficulty in finding participants for teleconferences and interviews may be indicat ive of the real challenge that Medi-Cal and advocates might face in conducting outreach for the CWD. Across the country, notwithstanding the significant outreach efforts unde rway, states have struggled to find individuals eligible for programs like Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program and continue to pursue strategies to enroll those w ho are eligible but not enrolled. Eligibility Worker Knowledge of CWD From an eligibility worker's perspective, the CWD Program is challenging in three important ways. First, it is a relatively new aid category. Second, the elig ibility and income rules are different from other more common aid categorie s, and they are complex. Third, few cases of applicants likely to be eligible for the program have presented themselves, and few individuals are expressly requesting enrollment in CWD. Th us, the program and its rules do not immediately come to eligibility workers' minds when determining eligibility. Collectively, these factors create a significant lack of program awareness. Eligibility worker awareness was repeatedly ci ted as a barrier to enrollment in the program because workers were often unaware that the pr ogram existed or misunderstood the eligibility requirements. For example, some eligibility work ers erroneously advised c lients that they would 60 The California Working Disabled Program: Lessons Learned, Looking Ahead not be eligible for the program due to their incomes (without first co mpleting an eligibility determination) or that in order to qualify they would have to di spose of any retirement accounts. The lack of eligibility workers' awareness may be at tributable to the fact that this program is still relatively new and that, over time, their know ledge and understanding of the program will improve. Training may also be an issue for eligib ility workers, who, for the most part, receive only minimal, if any, program training. Most enrollees responding to the survey learned about the progra m from an eligibility worker, and there is little active outreach for the program. These facts unders core the need for eligibility workers not only to be aware of the program but also to understand program requirements and rules. While providing training on CWD may app ear to be the obvious solution to improving eligibility worker awareness, the feasibility and effectiveness of such training may be questionable. Moreover, the trai ning itself represents another demand on eligibility workers' already constrained time. Eligibility workers have reported that the \"formal\" training they have received is only slightly helpful and that \" on-the-job training\" was more effective. Formal training curriculums could be developed to use a more \"hands-on\" approach. However, eligibility workers face increasi ng case loads and may find it increasingly difficult to take time away from processing cases to a ttend trainings; they are unlikely to pursue learning about the program on their own. In addition to the increasing demands on eligibil ity workers' time, the complexity involved in determining CWD eligibility may hamper eligibi lity workers' willingness to assess eligibility under both CWD and Medically Need Medi-Cal, as they are instruct ed to do. Instea d, eligibility workers may be inclined to determine eligibil ity for only the Medically Needy program, which was established prior to CWD and with which they have greater familiarity and understanding. Providing eligibility workers with a reference chart that compares enrollees' financial requirements for CWD and the Medically Needy Medi-Cal Program at various incomes might facilitate the CWD eligibility determination pr ocess. The chart could be used as a quick reference to advise applicants of their financia l responsibilities under either program and to help them determine which program is most beneficial financially. When discussing the lack of awareness of th e CWD Program, an interesting dynamic emerges between eligibility workers and potential enrollees , where each believes that the onus is on the other to initiate a discussion of CWD. Eligibility wo rkers state that pote ntial enrollees do not know enough about the program to request an elig ibility screen. However, potential enrollees and some eligibility workers report that ma ny eligibility workers do not know about the CWD Program and therefore fail to sc reen applicants who might be eligible. Study participants overwhelmingly cited this common lack of awaren ess as the primary reason for the program's low enrollment. Coordination with Ot her Organizations The lack of coordination with CBOs or other agenci es that provide services to the CWD's target population inhibits awareness. Coordinating wi th such agencies could help boost program enrollment. County Medi-Cal staff could meet with staff from other agencies and organizations to provide background information on CWD; in tur n, agency staff could refer individuals to the CWD Program. Additionally, informational materi als could be developed for dissemination or The California Working Disabled Program: Lessons Learned, Looking Ahead 61 display at various sites. Agenci es and organizations that might be targeted for a coordinated outreach effort include: vocational rehabilitation centers; Social Security offices; departments of aging and adult services; County Welfare Directors Association; hospitals; independent living centers; and job placement agencies. Results from the enrollee survey demonstrate th at CBOs and other local agencies have already provided at least some basic information about th e CWD Program to a small subset of the target population. While working with th ese agencies and organizati ons would require a modest investment of time and resources, it could prove a valuable way to reach CWD's target population. Agency employees who have frequent or ongoing contact with the target population and who have an understanding of this program can continue to refer potentially eligible individuals to the CWD Program long after a ny concentrated outreach campaign has ended. Program Attractiveness Awareness is not the only barrier to enrollment in CWD. While the program achieved extremely high satisfaction ratings from its existing enrollees, it is plausible that at least some subset of CWD-eligible individuals were aware of the program but chose not to enroll because they did not view CWD as desirable. More broadly, Medi-C al itself is often regard ed as \"second-class\" coverage, where care can only be accessed from a limited set of providers with long waiting periods for appointments. For some, the decision to enroll in CWD requires consideration of several factors not relevant to other Medi-Cal programs (e.g., the ab ility to maintain relationships with providers; implications for their monthly out -of-pocket health care costs; and eligibility for other benefit programs). Individu als considering CWD must wei gh the costs of enrolling\u2014some of which are described below\u2014agai nst the benefits of coverage. Provider Relationships Individuals with disabilities ma y have established relationships with providers, including specialists, which they wish to maintain. Findin g providers, particularly specialists who accept Medi-Cal coverage, is a barrier to care for many Medi-Cal enro llees. Often enrollees are unable to find providers who accept Medi-Cal coverage in the areas where they live, requiring enrollees to travel significant distances to obtain serv ices. Thus, enrolling in CWD may force individuals to find and develop new relations hips with providers. Knowing th at from a limited provider pool they have to find new providers that are likely to be unfamiliar with their medical history and may at best be inconveniently located could de ter some individuals from enrolling in CWD. 62 The California Working Disabled Program: Lessons Learned, Looking Ahead Financial Requirements Premium affordability is another factor that c ould be discouraging enrollment. Seventy percent of the existing enrollees are paying the progr am's minimum premium of $20. People with net countable income above $1,100 per month are required to pay a monthly premium of $100, which increases to $250 for individuals with m onthly income above $2,100. It appears that very few people in these income cohorts are curren tly willing to pay the pr ogram's premiums. CWD premiums at these higher income levels are hi gher than the average premiums paid by those covered through their employer. The SIPP data indicate that most low-income wo rking disabled people are \"asset poor\" as well. While low asset levels make them eligible fo r CWD, those eligible also have no source of savings that can be drawn upon to help pay th eir monthly premiums. A rational cost-benefit decision for many working disabled people may we ll be to remain uninsured. If their health status worsens, odds are that they will not be able to continue working and they will become eligible for Medi-Cal through othe r aid codes that do not entail a monthly premium (or a share of cost). Impact on SSDI Benefits Another factor that might influe nce the decision of eligible peopl e whether to enroll in CWD is the impact on their SSDI cash benefit. The ge nerous income standards of CWD encourage individuals to work and earn, often beyond the perm issible income standard of SSDI. However, once a person earns more than $780 per month, that individual loses eligibility for SSDI. Such an individual's earnings will ofte n be from a low-wage, part-time job, and may not be enough to make up for the lost SSDI income. The threat of losing what can be a substantial monthly benefit, coupled with the uncer tainty of finding and maintaining employment, may cause some eligible people to forgo pursuing employment a nd CWD coverage, choosing instead the security of a monthly SSDI benefit. Work Requirement The work requirement is another issue that may push eligible peopl e to choose other aid codes or take their chances and remain uninsured. CWD coverage may be perceived as an unreliable coverage option among disabled people who are struggling to maintain an already-tenuous workforce presence. CWD enrollees who responded to this study's survey worked predominantly in part-time jobs or in jobs where availability of work may be inconsistent. Disabled workers also experience challenges to workforce particip ation, such as personal car e needs, flare-ups of conditions that make them temporarily unable to work, and the need for certain accommodations, such as for those using wheelchairs. Those w ho are not yet working may experience some difficulty finding any employment at all. These in dividuals may opt to avoid risking their health coverage in the event that they are unable to find or maintain employment, choosing instead to enroll in another Medi-Cal aid category. The California Working Disabled Program: Lessons Learned, Looking Ahead 63 Expanding Eligibility Rules As found in the development of AB 925 and other related legisla tive initiatives, many disabled people currently ineligible because of some co mbination of income and asset levels might benefit from the features of CWD. The modeling component of this study supports the contention that a sizable number of additional wo rking disabled people could become eligible for CWD if the income threshold were increased and if the asset test were eliminated. However, based upon the program's low participation among t hose already eligible, it was also projected that very low enrollment impacts would resu lt from these policy changes\u2014only 189 additional enrollees if the income threshold were increased from 250 percent to 450 percent of FPL and if the asset test were completely eliminated. Given CWD enrollment levels to date, crowd-out of private coverage has not materialized to any significant degree. Crowd-out, wh ich is frequently cited as a concern when public health insurance programs are developed for the first time or are expanded, may especially be a concern to states that are currently f acing drastic budget deficits. Findings from the enrollee survey and data analysis indicate that thus far, working individuals with disabilities have not been dropping private coverage or employer-spons ored coverage in favor of CWD\u2014nor does this seem likely in the near future. Only 16 percent of survey respondents had private coverage prior to enro lling in CWD, and nine percent reported having privat e coverage while they were enrolled in CWD. Although the number of people with private coverage dropped s lightly, this change coul d be attributable to changes in employment or level of workforce participation. Survey data show that relatively few individuals had private coverage prior to enrolling in CWD and th at once enrolled, enrollees are keeping their private coverage , leaving CWD to serve only as wrap-around coverage. The coverage history of CWD enrollees also provides some proof that crowd-out is not occurring in the CWD Program. Most CWD enrollees (63 percen t) were already enrolled in a Medi-Cal aid category and not in priv ate health insurance. Most CWD-eligible individuals do not have access to employer-sponsored coverage. People working 30 or fewer hours per week typically do not receive employer-sponsored coverage. Among those who do have private coverage a nd are CWD eligible, the program's premium requirement may serve to deter them from dropping their employer's coverage in favor of CWD. CWD requires individuals to pay monthly prem iums ranging from $20 to $250 for individuals and $30 to $375 for couples, depending on income . For many at the higher levels of income, premiums for CWD may be substantially more burdensome than their share of premiums for employer-sponsored coverage. In 2001, the aver age employee contribution toward health coverage was $38 per month for single coverage. 39 CWD premiums jump to $50 for individuals with net countable monthly income between $700 and $900 and to $75 for those with net countable income between $900 and $1,100. Another deterrent to crowd-out is that the provi der network available th rough Medi-Cal is often far less comprehensive than what is available through private coverage. Disabled people who have longstanding relationships with providers an d who have private coverage will often find that they must sever such relations hips if they switch to Medi-Cal. 64 The California Working Disabled Program: Lessons Learned, Looking Ahead VIII. Conclusion A variety of programmatic and policy challenge s confront those interested in increasing enrollment in the CWD Program. The approach contemplated early in the life of AB 925 would have increased the income and a sset eligibility limits , thereby creating a si gnificant new pool of potentially eligible individuals. However, the CWD Program's sluggish upt ake rate demonstrates that granting eligibility in and of itself does not necessarily result in enrollment in the program. To maximize the benefits CWD can offer\u2014that is, providing health insurance to working Californians with disabilities\u2014it may be necessa ry to improve performance on multiple fronts. Current program experience demonstrates that merely expanding income and asset eligibility levels is unlikely to significantly boost pr ogram enrollment if those expansions are not accompanied by outreach efforts and improved eligibility worker awareness. In fact, the CWD Program might experience more significant gains in enrolling those who are already eligible under current program rules by concentrating effo rts in these two areas. Specifically, activities that would increase enrollment under current CW D standards without changes to eligibility include: promoting awareness among the uninsured e ligible population that is currently not enrolled in any Medi-Cal program; promoting awareness among providers, includi ng specialists and sa fety net providers such as county health clinics that traditionally serve the uninsured; and strengthening eligibility worker awar eness of and familiarity with CWD. Focusing efforts to enroll those who are alrea dy eligible under current program rules would not only result in greater increases in enrollment than would occur through program expansions, but the increases would occur more expeditiously. Such expansions and policy changes require vetting by policymakers and program administrato rs; they ultimately may require legislation, which could be an arduous process. However, if programmatic expansions are to be pursued, policymakers may want to: The California Working Disabled Program: Lessons Learned, Looking Ahead 65 identify opportunities to make the program 's premium and work requirements more attractive; and consider broadening CWD eligibility by adju sting the program's income and/or asset criteria. This study demonstrates that although the demand fo r this program is thus far modest, it has been effective in achieving its goals among those w ho are enrolled. Once enrolled, individuals are working and feel that their health care needs are being met. Enrollees are ve ry satisfied with their CWD coverage. Almost all survey respondents (87 pe rcent) were \"somewhat\" or \"very\" satisfied with CWD, compared to four percent of res pondents who were \"somewhat unsatisfied\" or \"not satisfied at all.\" Enrollees, who prior to en rolling in CWD likely had no or very limited prescription drug coverage, were es pecially thankful to have the prescription coverage available to them under CWD. Without CWD, they would have to bear the burden of paying out of pocket, juggling various other sources of prescription drugs such as samples, or having to forgo filling their prescriptions altogether. Enrollees also ex pressed a great deal of satisfaction with the relative affordability of premiums. The data sh ow that many CWD enrollees were previously enrolled in another Medi-Cal aid category in wh ich they were required to pay monthly share of costs significantly higher than th eir monthly CWD premiums. For th ese individuals, enrolling in CWD meant not only health insuran ce coverage and the ability to maintain employment; it also meant substantial reductions in their mont hly out-of-pocket health care expenditures. For many individuals, the ability to work is key to their overall feeling of well-being, and they want to feel that they were contributing to their communities rather than \"just being in the system.\" Even those whose ability to work is restricted by their physical capability (or who prefer not to work) find signifi cant enough value in maintaining th eir CWD coverage that they continue to work to stay enro lled. Many individuals expressed th at the peace of mind that comes with having health insurance coverage far outwe ighed the cost of mont hly CWD premiums or the other \"hassles\" of enrolli ng in Medi-Cal. Given the high le vel of satisfaction of current enrollees, enabling more individuals to enroll in the program, whether by exercising options to create new eligibility pools or by focusing on the already eligible population, would provide significant benefit to those individuals. 66 The California Working Disabled Program: Lessons Learned, Looking Ahead Appendix: Enrollee Survey The Lewin Group 3130 Fairview Park 800 Falls Church, VA 22042 703.269.5500/Fax 703.269.5501 www.lewin.com August 8, 2002 Dear Sir or Madam: What do you think about the Medi-Cal 250% Working Disabled Program?

The California Working Disabled Program: Lessons Learned, Looking Ahead 73 Notes 1. The state's CWD outreach attempts included se nding an informational flyer to enrollees in the Medi-Cal Aged, Blind, and Disabled Me dically Needy (Medically Needy) program who would likely be eligible for the new program; and re quiring counties to flag all Medically Needy cases as potentially eligib le for CWD. There was no requirement to contact enrollees. 2. In several counties, providing eligibility wo rkers with updated program manual sections or conducting briefings on the program made up the training activities. 3. Some individuals experience temporary laps es in work due to circumstances beyond their control, such as lay-offs or temporary flare- ups of their conditions . CWD currently extends coverage for two months for individu als who lose their jobs for good cause. 4. Kaiser Family Foundation and Health Research and Educational Trusts, 2002 Employer Health Benefits Survey , 2002. 5. The enrollment trend is based on the CW D enrollment of individuals who were not previously enrolled in another Medi-Cal aid category before en rolling in CWD. 6.

SIPP data was used in lieu of Current Popul ation Survey data because it contains more detailed disability and work data fields. Th e SIPP includes questions relating to the labor force, program participation, and income. The SIPP consists of a continuous series of national panels, with sample size rangi ng from 14,000 to 36,700 interviewed households. Each panel lasts between two-a nd-a-half and four years. Th e SIPP is administered by the U.S. Census Bureau. Modeling efforts us ed data obtained during Waves 11 and 12, between August 1999 and March 2000. 25. The number of survey packets prepared fo r mailing was based on estimated enrollment. According to Medi-Cal staff, 652 individuals were enrolled in the program as of August 2002. 26. For some survey questions, the total number of responses does not equal 162. Not all respondents answered each question and for some questions, respondents provided multiple responses. The survey analysis acc ounts for the variability in number of responses. 27. Counties were directed to designate a count y coordinator for CWD matters.

Howeve r, several enrollees stated that they do not receive the envelopes and instead have to request them from their eligibility workers in 76 The California Working Disabled Program: Lessons Learned, Looking Ahead small increments. Eligibility workers confirme d that they are providing enrollees with the envelopes, and that they also were advised that DHS would supply envelopes to enrollees. Enrollees wanted to receive 12 months' wort h of envelopes to minimize the number of times they have to request envelopes and mi nimize the chance that they would overlook a payment. Other respondents suggested that pr emium payments be processed more quickly. Some enrollees thought that the premium paym ent system would be improved if enrollees were mailed invoices at the time their premium payments were due. 36. The California Work Group on Work Incentives a nd Health Care (CWG) is a network of consumers, advocates, and agencies that have been active in mon itoring and supporting the effort to expand and improve access to program s and services, including health care, for working individuals with disabilities. The CWG is made up of representatives from community-based organizations, independent living centers, resource centers, and other organizations that provide services or resour ces, or have frequent interactions with individuals with disabilities. Because these agencies have been active and because they represent the community resources trusted and used by individuals wi th disabilities, the CWG was approached as a link to the nonenrollee population. 37.
