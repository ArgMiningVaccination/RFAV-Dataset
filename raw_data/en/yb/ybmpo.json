Masks work best when everyone wears one. COVID-19 virus spreads mainly from person to person through respiratory droplets. Respiratory droplets are released into the air when people breathe, speak, sing, cough, shout, or sneeze. These droplets can then land in the mouths or noses of nearby people or they may breathe the droplets in.", "sitename": null, "date": "2014-10-20", "cleaned_text": "The Los Angeles County requirements and recommendations for wearing masks in public indoor settings depend on the COVID-19 impact level, which is determined by how many people are newly hospitalized due to COVID-19 in the County. This level is reported weekly as the [COVID-19 Hospital Admissions Level](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#cases_new-admissions-rate-county) by the CDC. The current impact level is LOW. For a mask to work well, it needs to have both a [good fit and good filtration](#best-protection). While all masks provide some level of protection, well-fitting respirators (such as N95, KN95, and KF94) provide the best protection. There are some people [who should not wear a mask](#notwear), such as children younger than 2. People with communication difficulties or certain disabilities may need [special considerations](#specialconsiderations). | | RULES AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR INDOOR PUBLIC SPACES | | REQUIREMENTS | | When the level is LOW, MEDIUM, or HIGH, you MUST wear a mask: | | RECOMMENDATIONS | | THE LEVEL IS CURRENTLY LOW, so it is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED that you wear a mask indoors: (unless required - see above) In all other settings, you are encouraged to choose to wear a mask based on your preference and personal risk. | | **No one can be prevented from wearing a mask to participate in an activity or enter a business.** | | | | When the level increases to MEDIUM | | | | When the level increases to HIGH | | Workers must follow masking rules in the workplace. Healthcare and Direct Care settings: Workers in healthcare facilities and direct care settings are strongly recommended to wear a mask when they are providing care or working in-person with patients, clients, and residents. Other workplace settings, employers may choose to require workers and visitors to wear masks. Cal/OSHA Employers are required to follow the [Cal/OSHA COVID-19 Prevention - Non-Emergency Regulations](https://www.dir.ca.gov/dosh/coronavirus/Non_Emergency_Regulations/) or, in [Cal/OSHA (ATD) Standard](https://www.dir.ca.gov/dosh/dosh_publications/ATD-Guide.pdf). Cal/OSHA has more protective masking rules for workers in certain situations. Examples include: Review the Cal/OSHA links above for more information on the COVID-19 Prevention regulations. When workers are not required to wear a mask, employers must allow workers to wear a mask if they want to, unless it would create a safety hazard, such as interfering with the safe operation of equipment. See [Cal/OSHA FAQs: Face Coverings](https://www.dir.ca.gov/DOSH/Coronavirus/Covid-19-NE-Reg-FAQs.html#controls). For a mask to work well, it needs to have both a good fit and good filtration: The best mask has a high-quality filter, fits well against your face, and is comfortable enough for you to wear consistently. For the best protection, wear a well-fitting [respirator](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/types-of-masks.html#respirators). If you can't use a respirator, you can make your mask work better by [improving the fit and filtration](#improve-fit-and-filtration). * Some cloth masks are designed with specialized filter/layers and are tested to demonstrate that they perform at a consistent level. The American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) has set a standard (ASTM F3502-21) for barrier face coverings, including cloth (\"reusable\") masks. The most protective ASTM F3502-21 performance level masks have a particulate filtration efficiency of at least 95%. ASTM F3502-21 performance level ratings for some commercially available face masks are published on the CDC/NIOSH website [Barrier Face Coverings and Workplace Performance/Performance Plus Masks](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/PPEInfo/RG/FaceCoverings). If you are considering purchasing a cloth mask, look for ones with high performance level (95% particulate filtration efficiency) and that have been tested by an accredited third-party laboratory.
