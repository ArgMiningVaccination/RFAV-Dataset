Ghiasuddin - 2023 Haider graduated with an undergraduate degree in English and Chemistry from Dartmouth. At Dartmouth he developed a passion for creative writing and chemistry lab work and research. His creative writing honors thesis in fiction was a recipient of the Sidney Cox Memorial Prize, and he was also awarded a Dean's Fellowship from Harvard for graduate study in Muslim and South Asian literature and history, which he pursued directly after college. As Haider began translating his humanities education into community and volunteer work in the Greater Boston area, time spent with those facing serious illnesses and inequalities drew him back to science and medicine. Upon completing his Master's program at Harvard, he first worked as a medical scribe in primary care before working as a research technician in a Hematology-Oncology lab at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston for close to two years. During his time at Beth Israel he gained translational research experience in immunotherapy-based vaccine trials for patients with multiple myeloma and acute myeloid leukemia. More specifically, Haider took the lead in the chemical (IHC) characterization of tumors and experimental vaccines for patients enrolled in these trials in Boston and across the country, while also assisting in experimental vaccine manufacturing. Haider is incredibly excited to join UHS, as it is his desire to help contribute to improving the practice of and access of medicine for those who are most disadvantaged and marginalized in diverse environments, and to constantly better educate himself along the way. He also hopes to continue to channel his passions for creative writing and chemistry in trying to imagine something better.

Sima's ultimate goal as a physician is to use her experiences and insight to help provide better access to care to underserved communities in Los Angeles. Trenika Williams - 2020 Aaron Briggs - 2019 Aaron hails from the sandy, windswept shores of San Diego, California. While Aaron was privileged enough to grow up in a quiet suburb much of his extended family lives in poverty in Northern Philadelphia. Seeing his family struggle beneath the crippling disparities that permeate underserved urban communities inspired Aaron to use his privileged, educated upbringing to help those who were not as fortunate as himself. Throughout high school and his undergraduate study at Dartmouth Aaron worked extensively with underserved populations - focusing specifically on supporting the homeless, as well as victims of domestic violence and abuse. Aaron graduated from Dartmouth College in 2015 with a degree in Biology and began his first year at Geisel shortly after. While Aaron entered medical school with the intention of practicing within underserved urban areas he was unsure of the capacity in which he may best serve these communities. Aaron joined the Urban Health Scholars to gain an understanding of the unique medical challenges facing underserved communities in order to better prepare himself for a career in which he might work to meet them. Alec Fisher - 2019 Alec was born and raised in Los Angeles and almost became a professional surfer - decided to study physics at Johns Hopkins instead. At Hopkins I became interested in Neuroscience, majored in it and changed life trajectory to go to medical school. Before applying to medical school I wanted to get real life experiences and work with helping others so I went into Teach for America in Los Angeles specifically teaching in Watts at Locke High School. I taught physics for two years and raised engagement in sciences with hands on labs and after school science discovery clubs. Teaching at Locke exposed me to the disparities across socioeconomic boundaries which has led me to want to work with underserved populations. What excited me to go to Dartmouth Medical School so I could be part of the Urban Health Scholars group and get access to underserved populations while in a rural environment. The pipeline dream is to become a neurosurgeon and work to care for underserved populations in my hometown of Los Angeles, providing opportunities to care on a volunteer basis and work with local schools to increase interest in medical sciences and build mentorship programs for underprivileged high school students interested in medical sciences. Sarah Ghabbour - 2019 Sarah was born and raised in Arlington, MA, a Boston suburb. She graduated from Boston University in 2015 with a major in health science and minor in business administration.

After her undergraduate work, she lived in Salzburg, Austria where she played for the city's professional team within the Elite Women's Hockey League. She then spent two years in Boston, working to coordinate clinical trials for patients with multiple myeloma. Her most rewarding work in Boston was in helping to improve access to care by securing oncology therapies for patients who could not otherwise afford treatment. She received her Masters in Pharmaceutical Development with an emphasis in biologics manufacture and in-vitro diagnostics from the Keck Graduate Institute in Claremont, CA. There she worked as a peer health advocate, providing health and wellness counseling for undergraduate students within Los Angeles County. Through her work she learned the importance of educational programs in forming students' health behaviors; she co-developed risk mitigation programming for students to promote positive mental, physical, and sexual health behaviors. Through the Urban Health Scholars program, Courtney aims to learn new strategies and care models to best serve urban populations--after graduation she hopes to return to Los Angeles to address challenges of care access and health literacy through community-based initiatives. Outside the classroom, Courtney is a volunteer assistant coach for the Hanover High School girls hockey team and enjoys exploring the greater NH/VT area. TR Harris - 2019 Tim was born and raised in Portland, OR, Tim studied social science at the University of Washington. Making the most of his time there, yet having no clue on a career path, Tim joined Teach For America, and taught chemistry and AP Chemistry in inner city Detroit. It was there where Tim found his passion for critical consciousness and social justice. What started out as a two-year stint evolved into 5 years, where Tim took on leadership and administrative roles in Detroit's education, fostering the development of more than 5,000 students city-wide. While in the classroom, Tim saw gross inequalities, rooted in two concepts. First, there were a lack of resources that severely impeded access to an education, to healthcare, proper nutrition and many other basic human rights. Second, this inequality was systemic, running along lines of race, class and privilege. This committed Tim to seeking an opportunity to not only provide resources and treatment, but also help the most disadvantaged populations advocate for themselves. That is how Tim found medicine, a profession beyond simply providing treatment, but helping patients and the most disadvantaged populations advocate for their own health. So he took classes, volunteered in emergency rooms and is now reflecting on opportunities to serve inner-city populations after medical school. Spencer Mcfarlane - 2019 Spencer was raised in Queens, New York and then Baton Rouge, Louisiana, going on to graduate from The Ohio State University with a degree in Biology. He has been interested in urban health since his family opened up a medical practice (primary care) in Gonzales, Louisiana, an underserved city. From childhood to the present day, he came across many instances of disparity between where his family lived as opposed to the less socioeconomically advantaged community the clinic served. With the rationale that, through law and policy, he could address these and other societal components of health, and also to explore other interests, he attended and graduated from Washington University in St. Louis School of Law, concentrating on the human rights and health policy side of the law. He spent time volunteering on an HIV/AIDS health education project in Thailand and Vietnam at a Southeast Asian human rights NGO and subsequently worked as an associate at a bioethics public affairs organization. After realizing that practicing medicine was a career that would be the most fulfilling for him, he decided that he would do both -- practice medicine and serve as an advocate. As an Urban Health Scholar, I would like to create a space where I can work with my colleagues toward my goal of combining these two disciplines. Ultimately, I would like to continue exploring some of the ever-present socioeconomic disparities in America's urban society and also investigate the ways that law and policy may raise the quality of health and life of underserved populations. Brendin Beaulieu-Jones - 2018 Brendin grew up in Vernon, Connecticut. He graduated from Dartmouth College, with a degree in Biology (Genetics) and a minor in Applied Ethics. As an undergraduate, he worked in a computational genetics lab and completed a senior thesis investigating the associations between diet, genetics and metabolic syndrome in a cohort of Alaskan Natives. This work underscored the importance of considering lifestyle factors and the role of environment in investigating disease-related outcomes. After graduation, he completed a Health Policy Fellowship at The Dartmouth Institute, where he supported the implementation and analysis of the National Survey of Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs), as well as the evaluation of patient reported outcomes measurement. Brendin is interested in examining how innovate payment systems (e.g., global payment) will impact the care of vulnerable populations in urban communities, and how support for other contributors of health is integrated into the traditional spheres of healthcare. He is also passionate about learning how to achieve better population health through community-based initiatives (e.g., smoking cessation programs, substance abuse support services, HIV education and screening, healthy eating and exercise programs, etc.). Outside of the classroom, Brendin is a volunteer assistant coach for the Dartmouth Track and Field team, and he also enjoys skiing, hiking and exploring the Upper Valley. Chinwe Echeazu - 2018 Chinwe was born and raised in Chicago, IL. Growing up on the south side of Chicago, Chinwe saw first had many of the challenges and disparities faced by its residents everyday. She also worked as a Pharmacy Technician for CVS Pharmacy in various locations throughout the city, and saw the vast gap between the privileged, the poor, and those in between when it came to health care access, quality, and delivery. These experiences amplified Chinwe's pursuit of not only becoming a physician, but also an advocate for those in need. She graduated from University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign in 2012 where she obtained her bachelors degree in Community Health, specializing in Health Planning and Administration. After graduating, she moved further south in Illinois to Southern Illinois University in Carbondale where she completed the MEDPREP program and obtained her Master in Public Health specializing in Health Education. Here, Chinwe was deeply involved in efforts on campus to decrease unwanted pregnancies and STI contraction among high risk students. She also traveled to Naranjito, Honduras during January 2013 to participate in a medical brigade that brought medical services to a small town that would otherwise completely lack access to health care. Chinwe is very passionate about the promotion of healthy behaviors, both mental and physical, and is confident in the experiences, knowledge, and networking that she will gain from the Urban Health Scholars. Andrea Jaresova - 2018 Andrea is a Czech native who spent most of her childhood growing up in New York City. She earned her Bachelor's Degree from Dartmouth College in 2012, with a major in Women's and Gender Studies and two minors in French and Biology. As an undergraduate, Andrea was involved in numerous sexual assault prevention and awareness initiatives, serving as co-director of Mentors Against Violence as well as being a member of the Student Presidential Committee on Sexual Assault. Andrea also volunteered in her community at WISE of the Upper Valley, a domestic and sexual abuse crisis center in Lebanon, NH. Prior to attending the Geisel School of Medicine in 2014, Andrea spent two years working as a special education teacher in a Title I public high school in New York City and earned her masters degree in special education from Hunter College. Her experiences in both her undergraduate and graduate life have helped her cultivate a strong passion for working to empower underserved communities: first, by working to bridge the disparities gap in healthcare, and second, by creating initiatives in which the education system and the healthcare system collaborate together to ensure that a child's potential for success is not hindered by his or her inability to access quick, reliable and confidential health services. T.J. Meehan - 2018 T.J. was born and raised in central Connecticut in a suburb of Hartford. He graduated from Colby College in 2012 where he majored in Science, Technology & Society. During each summer of his undergraduate years, T.J. worked as a Research Assistant at Qualidigm, a consulting and research firm focused on quality improvement and cost-effectiveness of health care. It was through this organization that he learned that the care received by minority patients in his home-state is suboptimal and that disparities exist in access, use, and patient experience of care. Following college, T.J. continued working for Qualidigm on two research projects: one that measured the impact of EHRs on quality of care, and another focused on reducing hospital readmission rates. After a year with Qualidigm, T.J. joined the Community HealthCorps, a Connecticut-based AmeriCorps program that allowed him to serve as a Health Navigator and Quality Improvement Project Manager at Community Health Center Inc., a multi-site FQHC. Some of the most rewarding experiences that he had as an AmeriCorps member included: spending time at a veteran's home talking to patients about affordable oral care services; going door-to-door in low-income neighborhoods talking to residents about the Affordable Care Act and what it meant to them; meeting with low English proficiency immigrants to assist them in enrolling in health insurance plans; and providing free HIV/AIDs screening tests at a homeless shelter. At Geisel, T.J. hopes to find his niche at the intersection of urban health and community development. T.J. enjoys playing and coaching basketball and spending time with friends and family. Dwan Pineros - 2018 Dwan was born in Bogota, Colombia and immigrated to the United States with his family when he was 8 years old. He graduated from Boston College where he majored in economics. Dwan then worked for a technology consulting firm on merger integration projects for clients in the biotechnology and technology services sectors. Although he enjoyed many aspects of consulting work, it was lacking in one key respect. Dwan longed for work that satisfied his humanitarian impulses. After he resigned from his position, he spent a summer volunteering at the inpatient pediatric unit at the Boston Medical Center. It was during this volunteer experience that he was inspired to pursue a career in medicine and, in particular, to work with immigrant and urban underserved populations. He completed the medical school prerequisites at the Harvard Extension School and concurrently volunteered with The Family Van, a mobile health unit that provides free health screenings and health counseling to members of the inner city communities of Boston. Dwan also worked as a research assistant at the Massachusetts General Hospital and the Brigham and Women's Hospital on basic science and clinical research projects. His interests in medicine mirror his pre-medical experiences. He is interested in pediatrics, primary care, and addressing healthcare disparities. As an Urban Health Scholar, Dwan hopes to continue to cultivate his interest for urban health and to share his knowledge and passion for urban health with his fellow scholars as well as the greater Dartmouth community. In his spare time, Dwan enjoys outdoor activities and spending time with friends and family. Fernando Vazquez - 2018 Cristina Alcorta - 2017 Cristina grew up in northern New Jersey, right across the Hudson River from New York City. She graduated from Harvard University in 2012 with a degree in Human Evolutionary Biology. As an undergraduate, Cristina was involved in multiple community building and advising programs. She was a member of Latinos in Health Careers, a group that supported student professional interests with multiple resources, and served as a Peer Advising Fellow for Harvard freshmen. She volunteered as a Student Researcher at Harvard Medical School's Crimson Care Collaborative, where she gathered demographic and quality improvement data for a poor, refugee/post-incarcerated population in Chelsea, MA. After graduating college, she worked for Boston Children's Hospital as a Research Coordinator in the Neonatal Pulmonary Department, focusing primarily on respiratory issues in premature infants. Cristina wishes to stay active in urban communities as a pediatrician. She believes the Urban Health Scholars Program will fortify her values of service and give her ample opportunity to stay involved in resource-deficient populations. Tina Jaramillo - 2017 Tina was born in upstate New York and raised in Bethlehem, PA. From there, she went on to graduate in 2012 from Cornell University with a B.A. in Biological Sciences and Psychology. Her time spent working at the Cayuga Medical Center sparked her interest in medicine as well as caring for the underserved. After graduation, she spent the year working in the Americorps program, City Year Boston, where she tutored and mentored 10th graders at an inner-city public high school. From this experience, she gained perspective on the challenges low-income populations face, both inside and outside of the classroom. These challenges included many health related issues, and she saw her students struggle to gain access to the high quality care they deserved. Her time at the English High School confirmed that she wants to eventually work to close the disparity gap in health care, as well as work with youth populations who are the most at risk. As an Urban Health Scholar, she is excited to gain insight and knowledge on the struggles of at-risk inner-city populations, as well as strategies on how to spend her career advocating for health equity. After Geisel, she isn't sure exactly what branch of medicine she would like to pursue, but is strongly considering looking for a specialty within the pediatric realm. David Whitehead - 2017 Dave grew up in Downingtown, Pennsylvania. He graduated from Northwestern University with a degree in Chemical Engineering. During his time at Northwestern he served communities in nearby Chicago by triaging at a free health clinic and volunteering at a housing shelter. Abroad, he worked in Panama to address wastewater management challenges facing the town of Portobelo. After graduating, Dave's desire to work directly with communities to improve livelihoods brought him to Masindi, Uganda. In Uganda he helped start an agricultural social enterprise that strives to increase the incomes of small-holder farmers by empowering them with access to high-value markets. These experiences introduced Dave to the many challenges in promoting health and delivering healthcare to communities and have spurred his desire as a physician to work to improve disparities in health. Dave sees UHS as an awesome opportunity to continue to learn how to cultivate healthy, vibrant communities in underserved urban areas and as a place to learn from and encourage others striving to do the same. He enjoys traveling, backpacking, soccer, snowboarding and spending time with family and friends. Bianca Williams - 2017 Bianca Williams was born and raised in the South Shore region of Chicago, Il. about 10 minutes from where former Senator Barack Obama resided. During her youth, she was involved in countless activities including jazz, ballet, bible study, girl scouts, gymnastics, volleyball, etc. The list can go on and on, mainly due to the encouragement from her family. They are a very influential part of her life and the reason she is in medical school today. Bianca graduated from Howard University in May 2011 Magna Cum Laude, with a Bachelors of Science degree. For those who are not aware of the university, Howard is the original and most prestigious of the historically black colleges. The university is rich with history just like Dartmouth College. There she was accepted into the Phi Beta Kappa Honors Society. After graduation, she took a year to devote her time to volunteerism at her church food pantry and at LaRabida Children's Hospital. Bianca also continued work as a bank teller, a more exciting job than one would expect. Her love of science is rooted in the educational values her grandparents bestowed upon her. Bianca is eager to learn not only from the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, but also what you as her peers and colleagues will have to teach. "}
