It's a shame not too many people know how incredible chiropractic can be. Having been involved in a pretty bad car accident, and being told pain would be something I'd have to deal with just didn't sit well with me. So I did my research and found Dr. Justin Scott of STRONGLIFE Chiropractic. After a thorough exam, he pinpointed what needed to be done, and within several sessions, I was back to jogging again \u2014 something I was convinced I could no longer do. Three months later, I am completely back, and even better than I have ever felt.\" Janice R. \"I came to STRONGLIFE for post surgical therapy and I had great results in my recovery. Dr. Kim & Scott were very helpful in being able to help me get full mobility in my shoulder. All of the staff here were helpful and had a great time here with my recovery.\" Shawn P. "}
