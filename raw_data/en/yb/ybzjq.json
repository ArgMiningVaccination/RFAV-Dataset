In preparation for this, the Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) and the District of Columbia Public Charter School Board (DC PCSB) asked LEAs to develop Continuous Education and School Recovery Plans for the 2020-21 school year. OSSE required all LEAs in the District of Columbia that serve students in grades K-12 to submit continuous education plans in order to waive the requirement that a school year include a minimum of 180 instructional days at 6 hours per day as prescribed in 5-A DCMR \u00a72100.3. DC PCSB required all public charter school LEAs to submit continuous education plans to capture school academic and operational changes during the 2020-21 school year in response to COVID-19. These plans must meet certain baseline requirements\u2014namely, completion, clarity, alignment with applicable laws and policies delineated throughout this application, and for public charter schools, alignment with their approved charters. In addition, all plans must align with public health guidelines. The plan below has been approved for these purposes. This plan is intended to provide the public with information on how the LEA has prepared for the 2020-21 school year in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. LEAs have the flexibility to design continuous education and school recovery plans to best fit their individual or specific needs. LEAs may periodically update plans based on the evolving nature of the District's response to the pandemic. Additional questions pertaining to the implementation of these plans should be directed to the school and LEA. 1Term used to describe situations in which students access instruction from a location outside of the physical school building, whether delivered synchronously or asynchronously; distance learning is synonymous with remote learning. 2These policies are intended to capture school academic and operational changes during the 2020-21 school year in response to COVID-19. If a charter LEA intends to make any major academic or operational shifts for future school years (2021-22 or beyond), please reach out to DC PCSB staff to discuss memorializing those changes in a charter amendment. 3Refer to health guidance for child care and schools, available here: https://coronavirus.dc.gov/healthguidance . Note that this guidance is subject to change due to the need to respond effectively to the COVID-19 pandemic. LEAs are responsible for incorporating additional public health guidance into their policies as such guidance is released. Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 1 Application Questions School Recovery Operations Plan Regular Cleaning Schedule The school will regularly clean, disinfect, and sanitize surfaces, toys, and materials per District guidance on cleaning and disinfecting and the CDC's Reopening Guidance for Cleaning and Disinfecting Public Spaces, Workplaces, Businesses, Schools, and Homes . The following cleaning protocol will be updated as needed when new guidance is released. Routinely clean and disinfect surfaces and objects that are frequently touched. This includes cleaning objects/surfaces not ordinarily cleaned daily (e.g., doorknobs, light switches, classroom sink handles, countertops) Thoroughly clean and disinfect thermometers before and after each use per manufacturer's instructions. For all cleaning, sanitizing, and disinfecting products, follow the manufacturer's instructions for concentration, application method, contact time, and drying time before use by a child. See CDC's guidance for safe and correct application of disinfectants . Cleaning providers will place signage in every classroom reminding staff of cleaning protocols. Develop and implement a schedule for increased, routine cleaning, disinfection and sanitization. Use of shared objects (e.g., gym or physical education equipment, art supplies, toys, games) will be limited and cleaned between use. Toys, including those used indoors and outdoors, will be frequently cleaned and sanitized throughout the day. . Toys that have been in children's mouths or soiled by bodily secretions must be immediately set aside. These toys will be cleaned and sanitized by a staff member wearing gloves before being used by another child. Machine washable toys should be used by only one child and laundered in between uses. Mats/cots and bedding are to be individually labeled and stored. Mats/cots will be placed at least six feet apart while in use and cleaned and sanitized between uses. Bedding will be washable and laundered at least weekly or before use by another child. Mats/cots may be stacked between uses if it is cleaned and sanitized appropriately before stacking. Shared bathrooms will be assigned to specific groups of students and staff. Each group of students will have a specific time during the daily schedule to use their assigned bathroom. Bathrooms will be cleaned and disinfected after each group has finished. The school will implement safe and correct storage for cleaning and disinfection products. No cleaning products will be used near students. Staff will ensure that there is adequate ventilation when using these products to prevent children or themselves from inhaling toxic fumes. Rocketship Public Schools will clean all commonspace items (listed in the chart below) at the following times daily: 10AM 2PM Overnight, with an electrostatic sprayer1.Describe the LEA's plan to keep buildings clean, including: What is the cleaning schedule? For example, what happens weekly, daily, and multiple times per day?; and How you will ensure buildings are clean if/when an individual in a school community tests positive for COVID-19 (e.g., work with an outside vendor specializing in deep cleaning or train in-house janitorial staff to ensure cleaning standards are met)? Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 2 We have procured a disinfectant (Pure) which is safe for children, food surfaces, and kills COVID-19 in 90 seconds. This is one of the safest and fastest products available. All staff will have access to this product in their work spaces and we have ample supply to kick off the year with gallon refills arriving in the Fall. 10 AM 2 PMDuring the day All door handles (interior and exterior) All touched parts of bathrooms (faucets, soap dispensers, toilet flushers, toilet seats, etc.) All touched parts of the staff room and offices (copy machine buttons, refrigerator handle, coffee maker buttons, water dispenser buttons, sink fixtures, etc. All railings All light switches All hallway shelving, if applicable All countertops Door frames and other key areas at student height All staff should make sure to wipe down their cell phone with a disinfectant periodically Have a bin labeled \"Items to be Sanitized.\" This is where you will put items that do not appear to have an owner. We don't want to hold on to items, so if they do not seem like important things and can be trashed, that is best. Make sure there is a disinfecting bin for adult use near each bathroom. Ensure it is stocked when doing your disinfecting walkthrough. The bin should include Disposable Gloves, Paper towels, and Pure Disinfectant (and whatever else your campus needs). Mats and cots (PreK classrooms monitored by Appletree) Friday After Dismissal (for DC this will need to be done Tuesday after dismissal & Friday after dismissal)Weekly Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 3 Ensure Student Personal item containers in each classroom are disinfected and removed from the desks. The alternate cohort personal item containers should be switched into the desk for the following week. Setting this up at the end of each week will make sure we are ready for the next cohort! Although Rocketeers will not be rotating classrooms during COVID19 teachers will be. Teachers will be responsible for the following items during their time in the classroom and then when they exit the classroom. Classroom Disinfecting Checklist Wear gloves when disinfecting. The goal is for this to become a habit. This list is not exhaustive and if you are rotating classrooms, build in what makes you and your partner teachers comfortable. Owner: Teacher Disinfectant: Pure Hard Surface Cleaner How to use: Spray on surface1. Let dry for 1.5 minutes2. Kills all COVID germs3. Safe for kids and food surfaces4. It is optional to wipe down the surface after5. During the day Use only the items assigned to you (dry erase markers, erasers, etc). Any surface or item you touch, that is shared, will need to be disinfected before rotating.

If there is dirt or impurities on a surface make sure you are wiping down with disinfectant and a paper towel to remove. Just spraying the disinfectant will not be enough. Mats and cots At the end of the day Light switches Air conditioner controls All countertops Doorframes (high traffic touchpoints) Teacher Cell Phone Teacher Computer Chromebooks (if any are shared and/or staying in the classroom) Ipad (if applicable) Walkie Talkies If there is dirt or impurities on a surface make sure you are wiping down with disinfectant and a paper towel to remove. Just spraying the disinfectant will not be enough. Mats and cots Student Shared Materials Have a bin labeled \"Items to be Sanitized.\" This is where you will put items that a Rocketeer Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 5 uses but it is a community item (not from their personal materials box). This is used to hold items (other than books) that need to be disinfected before another Rocketeer can use the item. Books Every classroom will have a return book bin labeled \"Book Bin- Wait 24 hours before lending\" Books are returned to the Book Bin should have the exterior of the book disinfected and then left to sit for 24 hours before lending to another student Student Personal Items Lunches brought from home need to stay with the Rocketeer from arrival and throughout the day, ideally stored in the desk. Student Personal Materials (Pencil bin, or something similar that works on your campus) Exterior disinfected at the end of the week, prior to new students coming to campus Ideally, this is stored in a separate location in the classroom when that student is not on campus The main office and lobby area are usually high-traffic spaces. During COVID we are not planning on having anyone other than staff, students and emergency vendors (fire extinguisher inspection, elevator maintenance, etc) enter the school building after passing a Health Screening. The Office Manager's desk will have a sneeze guard and they will own the following disinfecting checklist for added protection. Front Office Disinfecting Checklist Wear gloves when disinfecting. The goal is for this to become a habit. This list is not exhaustive, you may need to add high touch areas on your specific campus. Owner: Office Manager and Office Assistant. Potentially Day Porter if time permits. Option 1: Disinfectant: Pure Hard Surface Cleaner How to use: Spray on surface1. Let dry for 1.5 minutes2. Kills all COVID germs3.

Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 7 Pens: Have a \"sanitized\" and \"dirty\" pen cup to keep track. All light switches All countertops Sneeze Guards All staff should make sure to wipe down their cell phone with a disinfectant periodically Have a bin labeled \"Items to be Sanitized.\" This is where you will put items that do not appear to have an owner. We don't want to hold on to items, so if they do not seem like important things and can be trashed, that is best. Daily Ensure the front office is cleaned and well organized before departing for the day. All paper products are stored away. All loose items have been sanitized and put away. There will be nightly disinfectant spraying, which works best when the office is organized and clutter-free. All personal items are stored in a safe location away from possible contamination. Try to minimize the items you bring back and forth from home to school and school to home. Nurse's Suite Cleaning Schedule The nurse's suite at each campus will follow the same protocols as the classroom checklist (see above), both during the day and nightly disinfectants. Positive COVID-19 Case Cleaning Schedule In the event of a positive COVID-19 case in the school community, the school will control spread by disinfecting all exposed materials and limit personnel from entering the contaminated area(s). No individual(s) will be allowed in the potentially contaminated area(s) directly following identification of a known positive case without gloves and masks and other PPE, as deemed necessary. The school cleaning vendor will be notified and asked to conduct thorough cleaning and disinfecting. Rocketship Public Schools has purchased an electrostatic sprayer for each campus and our custodial vendor, BusyBee, also has electrostatic sprayers. Electrostatic sprayers wrap all furniture and supplies with the disinfectant so that no surface goes uncleaned. We feel confident in using these sprayers that we will fully disinfect our spaces if a positive case were to arise. Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 8 In the event of a positive COVID-19 case on campus our Regional Director of Operations would inform local health officials (and others as deemed appropriate) and adhere to their guidance. While waiting on this guidance, we would immediately disinfect the room (all surfaces, all furniture, all personal items), bathrooms, and other areas the student or staff member may have been, using the electrostatic sprayer and a disinfecting product that is safe for children and food surfaces that has a 10-minute dwell time. We would need to leave the rooms ventilated for a minimum duration of 10 minutes before anyone else uses them. The disinfecting product is provided by CINTAS and is in stock on both campuses. In addition, RPS will follow the updated guidelines from OSSE on August 21, 2020, including: Step 1: Reporting to DC Health Schools must notify DC Health when: A staff member notifies the school they tested positive for COVID-19 (not before results come back) OR A student or parent/guardian notifies the school that the student tested positive for COVID-19 (not before results come back). Notify DC Health by submitting an online form on the DC Health COVID-19 Reporting Requirements website dchealth.dc.gov/page/covid-19-reporting-requirements under the section \"Non-Healthcare Facility Establishment Reporting.\" Select \"Non-healthcare facility establ ishment seeking guidance about an employee, patron, or visitor that reported testing positive for COVID-19 (epidemiology consult/guidance).\" An investigator from DC Health will follow-up within 24 hours to all appropriately submitted notifications. Note: While schools await a response from DC Health, plans should be made as soon as practical to close, clean and disinfect any areas or equipment that the COVID-19 positive individual may have used in the last seven days (see Step 3). If it is during the day when the COVID-19 case is confirmed 22 AND the COVID-19 positive individual was appropriately excluded from in-person activities while awaiting test results, it is acceptable to close, clean, and disinfect the spaces used by the positive individual after the students and staff in those spaces leave for the day. Step 2: Communication to Families and Staff Schools must have communication protocols in place that protect the privacy of individuals and alert their families and staff to a COVID-19 case. Communication is to be completed, per DC Health directive and will include: Notification to those staff and families of students in close contact with the individual, including the requirement to quarantine for 14 days; o Note: DC Health will identify close contacts based on its case investigation. It is not the responsibility of the school to define those that must quarantine. Notification to the entire school that there was a COVID-19 positive case, those impacted have been told to quarantine, steps that will be taken (e.g., cleaning and disinfection); Education about COVID-19, including the signs and symptoms at coronavirus.dc.gov; Referral to the Guidance for Contacts of a Person Confirmed to have COVID-19, available at coronavirus.dc.gov; and Information on options for COVID-19 testing in the District of Columbia, available at coronavirus.dc.gov/testing. DC Health will instruct schools on dismissals and other safety precautions in the event a known COVID19 individual came in close contact with others at school. Step 3: Cleaning, Sanitization, and Disinfection of Affected Spaces In the event of a confirmed COVID-19 case in a student or staff member, the school must follow all steps outlined by DC Health as well as the cleaning, disinfection and sanitization guidance from the CDC, linked here: Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 9 If seven days or fewer have passed since the person who is sick used the facility, follow these steps: 1) Close off areas used by the person who is sick. Note: If it is during the day when the COVID-19 case is confirmed AND the COVID-19 positive individual was appropriately excluded from in-person activities while awaiting test results, it is acceptable to close, clean, and disinfect spaces used by the positive individual after the children and staff in those spaces leave for the day. 2) Open outside doors and windows to increase air circulation in the areas. 3) Wait 24 hours or as long as p ossible before cleaning or disinfecting to allow respiratory droplets to settle. 4) Clean and disin fect all areas used by the person who is sick, such as c lassrooms, bathrooms, and common areas . If more than seven days have passed since the person who is sick used the facility, additional cleaning and disinfection is not necessary. Continue routine cleaning and disinfection. Staff conducting cleaning must adhere to PPE requirements as articulated in Appendix B. Additionally, RPS will conduct the following procedures for cleaning a space for a sympomatic individual or if/when an individual falls ill: Student or staff member develops symptoms of COVID-19 throughout the school day but is not confirmed to have COVID-19: o Immediately rope off or close, clean and disinfect areas and equipment in which the ill individual has been in contact. o Once the room is vacated at the end of the day, perform deep cleaning and disinfection of full classroom, and any other spaces or equipment in which the ill individual was in contact. This includes the isolation room after use by an ill student or staff member . Staff supporting, accompanying or cleaning up after a sick student or staff member must adhere to PPE requirements as articulated in Appendix B. Isolation Rooms Each RPS school will have a designated isolation room to use if a staff or student becomes ill during the day. RPS will follow this guidance from OSSE in terms of isolation room location / selection, cleaning, and monitoring: Schools must identify a well-ventilated space to isolate sick individuals until they are able to leave the school grounds. The space should be in an area that is not frequently passed or used by other students or staff, not behind a barrier, and that is not the health suite. If safe and nice weather, schools are encouraged to isolate sick individuals outdoors. When in the isolation area, the sick individual must always wear a non-medical (cloth) face covering or surgical mask, be within sight of the supervising staff member, and be physically separated from other individuals by at least 6 feet. To the extent feasible, isolate only one sick individual in the isolation suite at a time. The isolation area must be immediately cleaned and disinfected after the sick individual departs. Supervising staff must comply with the PPE requirements in Appendix B . Specific Student Treatments Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 10 RPS currently has students with specific nebulizer treatments. RPS will follow updated OSSE guidance from 8/21 to ensure these treatments are given in the safest way possible to mitigate as much risk as possible. RPS schools have designated spaces for these specific treatments and will be disinfected after each use. In the event a space in the school is used for an aerosol-generating procedure (e.g., tracheostomy suctioning), that room should be only occupied by the student or staff member engaged in the treatment. If tracheostomy suctioning is needed multiple times a day, schools should have well ventilated rooms dedicated for this purpose, ideally each assigned for exclusive use by a given student, and if possible with windows open If assignment of a particular room to a particular student is not feasible, the room must be closed for 24 hours after the treatment to allow respiratory droplets to settle, then cleaned and disinfected prior to use by another individual. Schools are encouraged to work with families and the school nurse to identify opportunities to transition the schedule for tracheostomy suctioning to before or after school, if medically appropriate. Spaces in which oral or nebulized medication has been administered should undergo routine cleaning and disinfection. Students who receive nebulized treatments should be strongly encouraged to replace the nebulizer with oral inhalers whenever possible. If students cannot use or do not have access to an inhaler, schools are strongly encouraged to provide nebulized treatments outside, if feasible and weather permitting. Schools are encouraged to work with families and the school nurse to identify opportunities to transition the schedule for nebulized medication administration to before or after school, if medically appropriate. Use of Space The school will take the following measures in its use of space and will modify changes in the physical environment as needed when new distiancing guidelines are released. Maximize spacing of occupants in each space with a minimum of six feet distance between desks. Limit occupants in any space based on the \"Phase\" per the DC Health requirement. Monitor for evolving guidance. Phase 1 - 10 individuals Phase 2 - 12 individuals plus one additional staff (13 total individuals) briefly added to the class as necessary to support individual student needs Phase 3 - Not provided at time of publication Phase 4 - Not provided at time of publication Students will have assigned seats throughout the day. They will face the same direction (rather than facing each other) to reduce transmission from virus-containing droplets (e.g., from talking, coughing, sneezing). If any child is facing another child we will provide physical barriers, such as a plexiglass table top barrier. Individual desks will all be turned to face the same direction and students will be staggered to maintain six feet distance. Individual carpet squares that will be cleaned daily will be used during floor time. Each student will be assigned a single square. The squares will be six feet apart. No more than 3 students will be assigned a table designed for 6, and no more than 2 at tables designed for 4. If sitting across from one-another, students will maintain a 6-foot distance. Computer stations will be separated by plastic flexible screens. Communal-use spaces (such as the cafeteria as an eating space, and playgrounds) will be closed. Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 11 Communal-use spaces (such as the staff room) will not be closed. There will be a maximum capacity determined (will be displayed on signage), the room will be disinfected at 10AM and 2PM, in addition to staff members cleaning items as they use them (ex. copiers, keurig, sink). All staff will maintain six feet of distancing at all times, there will be physical distancing stickers on the floor to aid with this. Here are Rocketship's expectations for the Staff Room: Hang sign outside of the entrance to remind staff that they must wear masks inside the space Hang Weekly Cleaning Schedule near the main entrance to the staff room, ensure its completed daily. Hang sign outside of entrance that clearly marks Maximum Capacity (This will be specific to your campus and need to include the number of adults allowed to be in the space while keeping 6 ft distance) Hang additional relevant COVID Signage in the Staff Room There are the following COVID related signage inside the staff room: - Near the sink: Remember to wash your hands for 20 seconds! - On each staff table: After use, please disinfect, thank you! - On the water dispenser: After use, please disinfect, thank you! - On the refrigerator: After use, please disinfect, thank you! - On each copier: After use, please disinfect, thank you! - On the entrance/exit: Use Hand Sanitizer when entering and exiting Staff is encouraged to wash hands when in the staff, if your staff room has a sink. Make sure the door is propped open, if possible. This will limit a high touch area. Hand sanitizer station at the entrance of the staff room, for use, when entering and exiting Remove communal items: 1. Coffee Pot - K-cup is fine, as long as staff disinfect after each use 2. Shared Sugar/Creamer container -Individual items are fine, ex. Sugar packets, individual creamers, as long as hand sanitizer is used before taking an item. 3. SpongesStaff Room Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 12 -If staff need to wash a personal item they should use paper towels to do so, and dispose of after (see below) 4. School shared coffee cups, utensils, etc -Single-use cups and utensils are fine. Schools should avoid using the sinks to wash items that will be shared with others. Instead, staff should wash their own items at home. Post instructions for disinfecting of the copier, water dispenser, single-use coffee maker (Kcup), sink and fridge after EACH use (choose one for your campus): Option 1: Staff must wear a mask when using, Have a disinfectant and paper towel station close to the high touch item. Have staff spray the paper towel, and then wipe down the high touch item after use. The staff uses hand sanitizer or hand wash after use. Option 2: Staff must wear a mask when using, Provide disposable plastic sheets for staff to use when using the high touch item. The staff uses hand sanitizer or hand wash after use. Option 3: Staff must wear a mask when using, Provide disposable gloves for staff to use when using the high touch item. The staff uses hand sanitizer or hand wash after use. Copier toner/cartridges in stock (at least 1 extra toner/copier) and organized Copier paper in stock and organized Organized. labeled system for unclaimed copies. Anyone handling unclaimed copies must wear gloves. Staff room countertops clean and free of debris and unclaimed copies Staff room sink clear of dirty dishes and debris Staff room supply cabinets are organized and labeled. You can easily find each of the following sanitizing items: - Paper Towels - Dish Soap - Hand Sanitizer - Hand Soap - Disinfectant Spray There is disinfectant spray and paper towels on every staff room table. Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 13 Staff room table/chairs are not broken and clear of marks, stains, debris. Physical education classes will be held outside, weather permitting and students will maintain proper distancing using visual cues (e.g., mark the ground where students should stand). No interactive activities will be permitted (e.g. basketball, football, soccer) Physical barriers, such as plastic flexible screens, will be installed between bathroom sinks and urinals, if applicable. Rocketship will be doing a one student at a time bathroom procedure, as we have communal sinks and the spaces are not large enough to maintain physical distancing once when entering, using the sink, and exiting the bathrooms. A designated area, with its own ventilation, will be available for any student or staff who exhibit symptoms, such as a fever or a cough, until the individual can be safely removed from the facility. This area will be separate from the area used for routine healthcare. Place students head to toe during nap times. Nap mats will be cleaned each evening with an electrostatic sprayer. Use of Hallway Hallways will include occupant traffic flow direction marking on the floor, maintaining one-way traffic where possible and two-way traffic separated by six feet or maximum possible where space is not sufficient. Additional signage including floor stickers and wall signage will be used ,as needed, to provide direction and instruction for movement. Extra time will be allowed during a transition, although transitions will be rare, to foster careful transition between spaces. During transitions there will be more than one teacher present to support in maintaining physical distancing and mask wearing. School buildings reopening after a prolonged shutdown will ensure building systems, such as ventilation and water systems and features (e.g., sink faucets, drinking fountains, decorative fountains), are safe to use. Ventilation standards will be updated as needed when new guidance is released. Ventilation Prior to reopening after any prolonged shutdown, the school will engage with the HVAC vendor to ensure the systems operate properly and increase circulation of outdoor air as much as possible. Windows and doors will be opened where possible to maximize air quality for occupants while considering safety and health risks such as risk of falling, outdoor air quality triggering asthma symptoms, building fire safety, and security. In addition, Rocketship Public Schools will ensure our HVAC vendors to install the highest MERV rating filter our AC units can handle safely. In addition, Rocketship is researching iWAVE which is a light filter that can be installed on AC units that immediately kills COVID-19 as it is filtered through the unit. We have not finalized our purchase yet. For any room that does not have its own AC vent or window, Rocketship will be purchasing a room air purifier. Where possible and safe, we will prop doors and windows to increase ventilation and limit touch points. We will not ever prop open doors that lead to our exterior. We will determine the safety of open doors by our ability to quickly move into a \"lockdown\" if needed. We will also monitor how our students are responding to the open doors and windows. If keeping classroom doors/windows open distracts students, or a student exits without permission, or the temperature becomes uncomfortable we will adjust our approach.3.What have you done to ensure adequacy of ventilation at the school? Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 14 Refer to health guidance for childcare and schools, available here: https://coronavirus.dc.gov/healthguidance .Rocketship will continue our monthly HVAC inspection and filter changes to maintain the effectiveness of the units to filter the air. These vendors will be asked to wear masks, sign in, and must pass a Health Screening before entering the building. Water System Prior to reopening after any prolonged shutdown, the school will flush all water systems to clear out stagnant water and replace it with fresh water. This process will remove any metals (e.g., lead) that may have leached into the water and minimize risk of Legionnaires' disease and other diseases associated with water following CDC guidance and as described below: Flush hot and cold water through all points of use such as sinks, drinking fountains, toilets, urinals, and showers. Water heater will be set to 140 degrees Fahrenheit and hot water will be flushed at each fixture using hot water until its maximum temperature is reached. Additional water using devices, such as ice machines and drinking water dispensers, will be flushed in accordance with manufacturers' instructions. Physical (Social) Distancing The safety of our teachers, staff, students, and their families is our number one priority when offering on-site learning. Individuals in the facility will maintain a distance of six feet of separation between each other and have not more than the maximum number of individuals in a single room or engaging in an outdoor activity as prescribed by the Phase Guidance provided by DC Health and the Mayor's office. During all phases, the school will limit non- essential visitors, and all non-essential visitors must be approved by the School Administration before being granted access to the building. The distancing protocol will be updated as needed when new guidance is released. Traveling to and from School Students, families, and staff will be instructed to be aware of safety considerations during their travel to and from school, including using public transportation, individual cars, shared cars, and school-provided transportation services. Students, families, and staff who walk to school will be instructed to wear masks and practice measures for minimizing exposure on their commute with the following tactics where possible: Maintain six feet of distance between others on the sidewalk as much as possible avoiding most congested routes if an alternative route is reasonable and safe. Stand back from gathering points such as intersections, where reasonable and safe, to avoid congregating in large groups. Avoid touching unnecessary surfaces and objects. When surfaces and objects are touched, such as crosswalk buttons, use hand sanitizer with at least 60 percent alcohol. Students, families, and staff who rely on public transportation to get to school will be instructed to wear masks and take proactive measures for minimizing exposure on their commute with the following tactics 4.Outline the LEA's plan for 2020-21 school year school operations to ensure all students have safe access to instruction, either in person or at home. Describe, in detail,student and staff schedules, arrival/dismissal procedures,plan for distributing educational materials, plan to oversee before/after care and extracurricular activities, plan to providemeals, and plan to provide personal protective equipment (PPE). Be sure to follow the public health guidance. Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 15 where possible: Maintain six feet of distance between others on the sidewalk and train platforms avoiding most congested routes if reasonable and safe. Stand back from gathering points such as intersections to avoid congregating in large groups. Familiarize and stay current with transit system procedures for safety of passengers. Avoid touching unnecessary surfaces and objects. When surfaces and objects are touched use hand sanitizer with at least the recommended percent alcohol. Use hand sanitizer after leaving the transit system. For the remaining distance, students will be instructed to follow the above regarding walking to school. Students, families, and staff who are dropped off at school or who drive will be instructed to wear masks upon exiting the vehicle and to take proactive measures for minimizing exposure on their commute with the following tactics where possible: Maintain six feet of distance between others on the sidewalk as they walk up to the school building. Use hand sanitizer with at least 60 percent alcohol after leaving the vehicle. For transport vehicles (e.g., buses or car share from metro or specific bus stops) that are used by the school, drivers and riders will practice all safety actions and protocols as indicated for other staff. Students will sit at least six feet distance from one-another, wear masks, and use hand sanitizer upon entry and exit from the vehicle. Entering and Exiting School Building All students, families, and staff, will be provided instructions for entering and exiting the school. Below are the guiding principles for Rocketships Arrival and Dismissal process. In addition, you will see our Arrival and Dismissal checklists for Operations staff following the bulleted list. Consult students, families, and staff on the details of the plan. Stagger arrival and dismissal times to reduce peak student traffic in and out. We will use multiple entry points only if we have a Health Screener at each entry point. This will be the method used, in addition to staggering, to avoid long lines and to keep students apart from one another Provide health screening at each entry point. Use multiple doors, each with a screening station, for entry and exit. Ensuring safety and security of all entry and exit points used. Assigning entry and exit points to students by their group that are close to their first and last location of the day. Mark direction lines and six foot separation standing spots on the exterior pavement and post procedures for health screening check-point ahead. Rocketship is requiring guardians to stay with their student until they pass the Health Screening. That way, if a student does not pass they can immediately head home with a parent. Evaluate shelter accommodations to protect students in line from the elements (e.g., sun and rain). Rocketship has purchased pop-up tents to aid in sun and rain protection during arrival and dismissal. Evaluate safety of outdoor lines related to safety and security threats (e.g., behavioral issues, traffic). Rocketship will have staff outside physically distanced to monitor the health screening line and traffic. When possible, we will be using our car rider line to do the Health Screening, which will also increase the efficiency of physical distancing for students, families and staff. Shared Entry/Exit. All of our campuses have partner schools in the building. We will be coordinating our arrival and dismissal activities as a united team to ensure safety of all.

Staff may open car doors if needed, then move back 6 feet to allow students to exit. Students will close their own car door. PHYSICAL DISTANCING STICKERS FOR CAR RIDERSAfter exiting their car, Rocketeers stand on exterior physical distancing stickers as they walk to the campus entrance. Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 19 SCHOOL LEADER GREETING & MONITORING HAND SANITIZERA school leader can greet each child, but with maintaining physical distance. School Leaders can not touch students, as they normally would with a handshake, hug, high-five. HAND SANITIZER BEFORE ENTERING CAMPUSAll students and staff sanitize hands as they enter the launch area/building- sanitizer stand alone dispensers are being ordered for each school and should be placed at the entrance to launch. MONITORING ROCKETEERS ENTERING100% of Rocketeers are monitored until they get to their classroom (parking lot, hallways, stairwells). They should be monitored by adults who remain physically distant. ROCKETEER PRE- LAUNCH EXPECTATIONSPRE-LAUNCH BASIC EXPECTATIONS: Use hand sanitizer when entering a room, sit at their assigned desk, eat breakfast in ZONE 1. ROCKETEER HOME LUNCHES, if applicableIf a Rocketeer brings lunch from home, make sure they put it in their desk. If not using desks, come up with an alternative. ARRIVAL PROCESS ENDS WHEN THERE IS A NATURAL BREAKAlthough we typically have a hard Arrival end time, during COVID19 moving fast is not the ultimate goal. Instead, we are focused on ensuring that 100% of Rocketeers and Staff go through the Health Screening and follow physical distancing guidelines to their classroom.. LATE DROP OFFYou will need to staff Arrival for late drop off for ~15 minutes (campus specific) to make sure that all students who arrive \"late\" are screened before entering campus. This screening process should not happen in the lobby, it needs to happen outside of the building to ensure the safety of all. DAILY LUNCH FOR ALTERNATE COHORT (also on Lunch checklist)Each morning from 8:30AM - 9:30AM: Schools run meal distribution for families (alternate cohort) not attending school that day via the car rider line. Needs to be staffed by 1-2 people depending on need. Each family receives one breakfast and one lunch for each student. Schools should make sure to allot additional prep time for staff to have this ready. SIGNAGE for DAILY LUNCH FOR ALTERNATE COHORT (also on Lunch checklist)Make sure families of the alternate cohort know what to do through signage to pick up their lunches.

HAND SANITIZER STATIONSThere are a minimum of 2 hand sanitizer stands (6ft apart) for Rocketeers to use as they exit campus and walk to their car or their parent. STAFF physical DISTANCINGAll staff maintain 6ft distance between themselves and others for entire system with no congregation or physicalizing evident. ALMOST ALL FAMILIES USE THE CAR LINECar line pick-up only unless extenuating circumstances, this is to help maintain physical distancing to keep all safe. Parents will indicate on orientation documentation if they do not have access to a vehicle and need to walk for pick up. Walker cards will only be given to families who do not have the option to drive. PHYSICAL DISTANCE: WALKER LINEParents must wait in a holding area, wear a mask and stand on physical distancing exterior floor stickers as they wait for their rocketeer. PRE-DISMISSAL BASIC EXPECTATIONS: - Rocketeers start Dismissal from their classroomROCKETEER DISMISSAL EXPECTATIONS Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 21 - Walk physically distant to the dismissal area using hallway and stairwell physical distancing stickers. - Use hand sanitizer before walking to their car/adult - Follow physical distancing stickers to their car/adult PHYSICAL DISTANCING STICKERS FOR PEDESTRIANSPhysical Distancing markers are present at all entry/exit & waiting points on the school's campus. ROCKETEERS STAND ON PHYSICAL DISTANCING STICKERSAll Rocketeers stand on physical distancing stickers while exiting/entering car/bus/parent PHYSICALLY DISTANT - MONITORING ROCKETEERS ENTERING/EXITING SCHOOL100% of Rocketeers are monitored until they get to their car/bus/parent. LATE PICKUP ROCKETEERSParents will not enter the school. Late Pick Up room should be a location near the front of the school. One staff member should be posted in the front of the school and an additional 1-2 staff members should be stationed with the students. When a parent arrives with their dismissal card, staff walkies the other staff who is with the children to send the child to the front. The following reasons are reasons that individuals will be excluded from entering the building: The student, staff member or visitor has had a temperature of 100.4 degrees or higher or any of the symptoms listed above in the \"Daily Health Screening\" section of this guidance. The student, staff member, visitor or any close contact is confirmed to have COVID-19. The student, staff member or visitor is awaiting COVID-19 test results. The student, staff member or visitor has traveled to a high-risk state or country, as defined by DC Health, for non-essential activities within the prior 14 days. The following guidance will be used to dismiss students or staff from campus: Student or Staff Member Develops Fever or Signs of Illness at School If a student or staff member develops a fever or other signs of illness, RPS will follow the above exclusion criteria regarding the exclusion and dismissal of students and staff. For students, the school is to immediately isolate the student from other students. The student must immediately put on a cloth (non-medical) or surgical face covering, if not wearing already. 18 o Additionally, Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 22 schools must: Notify the student's parent/guardian of the symptoms and that the student needs to be picked up as soon as possible, and instruct to seek healthcare provider guidance. o Identify a staff member to accompany the isolated student to the isolation area and supervise the student while awaiting pickup from the parent/guardian. The staff members briefly responding to the sick student in the classroom, accompanying the student to the isolation area and supervising the student in the isolation area must comply with PPE requirements. Follow guidance for use of the isolation room we have in this plan Immediately follow all cleaning and disinfection protocols for any area and materials with which the student was in contact. For staff, RPS will send the staff member home immediately or isolate until it is safe to go home, instruct the staff member to seek healthcare provider guidance, and follow cleaning and disinfecting procedures for any area, materials and equipment with which the staff member was in contact Daily Health Screening Students, families, and staff are advised to check their own temperatures prior to arriving at school each day. Knowing that all families may not have access to sterile thermometers, daily health screenings will ensure that no person entering the building has a fever. Rocketship Public Schools will be doing a Health Screening for every staff, vendor, and student to enter campus during COVID19. During temperature checks, the Health Screenings will wear personal protective equipment (PPE) and use a non-contact thermometer to minimize exposure. Health Screening Team expectations will be: Wash hands with soap and water for 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use a hand sanitizer with at least 60 percent alcohol. Put on PPE. This includes a face mask, face shield, and a single pair of disposable gloves. Take the individual's temperature using a non-contact thermometer . After the arrival process, remove and discard PPE . Wash hands with soap and water for 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use a hand sanitizer with at least 60 percent alcohol. Disinfect the thermometer and keep it in a central location for easy access during the day and to prepare for the next day. Grouping The school will take measures in its scheduling and planning to achieve the following grouping practices: The school will group students and staff together each day (as opposed to mixing groups of teachers and students, where possible). The school will not host any group activities or large gatherings of students, such as assemblies and indoor physical education classes when six feet of distance is not possible. In grades where students traditionally transition between classes,we will rotate teachers between classrooms, rather than students. The school will correlate classroom groups with entry and exit points as well as coordinate use of hallways, restrooms, playgrounds (as applicable), and other shared spaces to avoid mixing groups. Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 23 In School Dining Use pre-packaged lunches, including plasticware, napkins, and seasonings, or serve meals individually plated. Students will eat meals in the classroom to avoid mixing in the cafeteria. Meal distribution, eating, and waste collection will occur with six feet separation coordinated with one-way traffic arrows and queue lines marked on the floor of the classroom where possible. Additionally, Students will wash hands before and after eating, and may not share food, utensils, cups, or plates. Staff will wash hands before and after preparing food, and after helping children to eat. Tables and chairs will be cleaned and sanitized before and after the meal. To the extent possible, students will eat prepackaged meals in their classrooms. During virtual learning, schools will provide curbside, contactless pick up for meal service for families. This will happen at least 2 times per week at each campus to ensure families have breakfast and lunch throughout the entire week. All food will be pre-packaged and disposable. There will be designated areas for students with allergies to eat their food to ensure their safety at all times. Meal Service Updates: RPS will use disposable food service items (e.g., utensils, dishes). If food is offered at any event, have pre-packaged boxes or bags for each attendee instead of a buffet or family- style meal. Students may bring lunches from home. RPS will keep each student's belongings such as lunches separated from others' and in individually labeled containers, cubbies, or areas. Communication with families about cleaning items brought from home will occur during communiity meetings. RPS will ensure adherence to students' 504 plans and Anaphylaxis Action Plans, including ensuring that students are not exposed to foods to which they are allergic. Recess/Breaks (if applicable) The school will continue to hold recess and/or outside playtime, and will maintain physical distance between students outside, including staggering groups and dividing space outside as needed. The school will create a school wide schedule to ensure students have outside time. Students will not be able to play on the playground equipment, but will have physically distant spaces to play individually in, as the schedule permits. Canceling, Eliminating Activities The school will cancel, eliminate, or modify the program to adhere to the following: Cancel or modify classes where students are likely to be in very close proximity (e.g., Choir or Band). Cancel activities and events such as field trips, student assemblies, athletic events or practices, special performances, and school-wide parent meetings. Eliminate non-essential travel for staff and teachers (e.g., conferences). Revise the process for receiving mail and packages; only have necessary delivered and combine orders so fewer deliveries are made. Limit non-essential visitors (e.g., prohibit outside visitors from entering the school unless their presence was requested or if they received permission to enter the school). Stagger activities' times or locations by cohort to maximum extent feasible. Preventing a Vaccine-avoidable Outbreak Preventing the spread of COVID-19 is top of mind and has led to a decrease in vaccinations of students across the Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 24 country, according to the CDC and DC Health officials. As a part of the student enrollment process, the enrollment team/registrar will confirm that all student vaccinations are up to date prior to fully enrolling a student. If it is determined that a student has been unable to get vaccines, the enrollment team will coordinate with the student support team and school nurse (if assigned) to support the student in getting an up-to-date screening. Non-medical (Cloth) Face-coverings All school staff will wear cloth face coverings at all times when in the building, and when outside of the building when in close proximity to students and families. If an adult has a medical condition that prevents them from wearing a face covering, they must have documentation on file from a medical provider that they are not able to do so. We will work with all staff during onboarding to ensure that accommodations are met. Otherwise that individual should not participate in in-person school activities. Students and families are encouraged to wear cloth face coverings during arrival, dismissal, and at all times while moving around the school building. Students under the age of 6 will not be required to wear a face covering. Older children, adolescents and adult students will be required to wear face covering when in the hallways, bathrooms, or other communal spaces within the facility. Instances when face coverings need to be worn: Students should wear face coverings as feasible, and most importantly when physical distancing is difficult (e.g., hallways, restrooms) and on their travel to and from the school if using public transportation. While visitors to the school should be strictly limited, should a visitor need to enter they should wear a face covering on the school grounds and inside the school buildings at all times. Instances when face coverings do not need to be worn: Outdoors when social distancing of at least six feet is strictly enforced. By anyone who has trouble breathing, or anyone unconscious or unable to remove the mask without assistance. By children during naptime. Ensuring the safe use of clean cloth face coverings: Students and staff will bring multiple cloth face coverings with them. In the event that a student, staff, or guest does not have a face covering, one will be provided by the school. Staff and students will exercise caution when removing the covering, always storing it out of reach of other students, and wash hands immediately after removing it. If a student or staff member tampers with the face covering of another student or staff member, it should be removed immediately and replaced with a clean one. Instances when face coverings do not need to or should not be worn: By children younger than 2 years of age; By anyone who has trouble breathing, or anyone unconscious or unable to remove the mask without assistance; By children during naptime; When engaged in activities in which there is a risk of burn or injury from the use of a face covering\u2014such as chemistry labs with open flame; When participating in vigorous physical activity (e.g., recess) outdoors if social distancing of at least 6 feet is feasible. When outdoors but not participating in physical activity, face coverings must continue to be worn; When in the water in a swimming pool; Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 25 When actively drinking or eating a meal; When in an enclosed office that no one else is permitted to enter. Staff may wear face coverings with clear plastic windows, or briefly remove their face coverings, when interacting with students with disabilities identified as having hearing or vision impairments, who require clear speech or lip- reading to access instruction RPS will ensure ensure additional protocols are in place to support the safe use of clean face coverings. When feasible, staff and students wearing face coverings should bring multiple clean coverings each day. Schools are encouraged to have face coverings available to staff, students and visitors in the event they forget or soil their face covering. Staff and students should exercise caution when removing the covering, always store it out of reach of other students, and wash hands immediately after removing. Be careful not to touch eyes, nose or mouth while removing the mask. Face masks that are taken off temporarily to engage in any of the aforementioned activities should be carefully folded. The folded mask can be stored between uses in a clean sealable paper bag or breathable container. Face masks should be stored in a space designated for each student that is separate from others when not being worn. They can also be placed next to student on a napkin or with the surface cleaned afterwards. Student's cloth face coverings should also be clearly identified with their names or initials, to avoid confusion or swapping. Student's face coverings may also be labeled to indicate top/bottom and front/back. The benefit of such a face covering is to limit the spread of secretions. As much as possible, school staff should prevent students from playing with their or others' face coverings and ensure they are removed and stored safely. Students, teachers and staff should be taught to speak more loudly, rather than remove their face covering, if speaking in a noisy environment. Hygiene The school will prioritize personal (hand) and school-wide hygiene practices that prevent and contain the spread of disease, including COVID-19. School-wide Hygiene: The School will work with the janitorial/custodial services provider to ensure that the following environment will occur to maintain a healthy environment. A Health Screen occurs for all people entering the school. Health Screen materials are properly cleaned. Adequate supplies (e.g., soap, paper towels, hand sanitizer, tissue) are readily available in every bathroom and classroom throughout the day. All students will be provided with their own materials in designated and labeled bags or bins. All student belongings will be separated and stored in designated areas (e.g. locker, cubby, bin). Electronic devices (e.g. computers, smartphones, Chromebook) will be assigned to an individual. In the event that a student may need to borrow one (e.g. IT issue, forgot their device), the school will provide recently sanitized equipment. Increase air circulation only where safe and possible and ensure ventilation systems are operating properly. Encourage staff and students to cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue. Used tissues should be thrown in the trash and hands washed immediately with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 26 Install no-touch fixtures where possible (e.g., automatic faucets and toilets, touchless foot door openers, touchless trash cans, touchless hand sanitizer dispensers). Drinking fountains will not be used other than to refill individual bottles. Regular hand sanitizing will be enforced: Ensure handwashing strategies include washing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom, before eating, and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. If soap and water are not available and hands are not visibly dirty, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60percent alcohol. (NOT METHANOL) Make hand cleaning supplies readily available in classrooms, bathrooms, and offices. Set up sanitizing stations outside of large common spaces including the gymnasium, cafeteria, playgrounds or outdoor spaces, and entrances/exits. Students will wash or sanitize their hands when both entering and exiting a classroom or between activities. Enforce a \"you touch it, you take it\" policy in classrooms. High-risk Individuals Students and staff at high-risk for contracting or experiencing severe illness due to COVID-19 will be cleared by their medical provider before participating in on-site activities. Consideration will also be made for live-in family members of students or staff at high-risk. Risk factors include: Cancer COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) Immunocompromised state from a solid organ transplant Obesity (BMI of 30 or higher) Sickle Cell Chronic Lung Disease Moderate to Severe Asthma Serious heart conditions Immunocompromised conditions Severe obesity (>40 Body Mass Index) Diabetes Chronic kidney disease, and/or Liver Disease People 65 years and older Any child, parent, or staff member who has a medical condition not on this list, but is still concerned about their safety RPS does not require medical clearance for any high-risk individual before participating in an in-person activity. Exclusion or Dismissal from On-site Learning The School will adhere to the following exclusion and dismissal criteria: Exclusion Criteria : Students and staff must stay home, or not be admitted if: The student or staff member has had a temperature of 100.4 degrees or higher, Any member of their household is confirmed to have COVID-19, or Any member of their household is awaiting COVID-19 test results. If a student or staff member reports any of the above symptoms or exposure, or is confirmed to have COVID-19, the student or staff member must not return to school until: 72 hours after the fever has resolved without the use of fever-reducing medication (e.g. Motrin, Tylenol) and respiratory symptoms have improved; AND at least 10 days after symptoms first appeared, whichever is later ; OR Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 27 per their healthcare provider following DC health instructions. If any student or staff member has been in close contact with a person who is positive for COVID-19 , then the student or staff member must not enter the facility until cleared by their healthcare provider or has completed their quarantine period without becoming symptomatic or diagnosed with COVID-19. If any student or staff member has been in close contact with a person who is awaiting a COVID-19 test result , then the student or staff member must not enter the facility until the close contact tests negative. If the close contact tests positive, then they should seek guidance from their healthcare provider or DC Health. Dismissal Criteria : If a student or staff member develops a fever or other signs of illness, the school must follow the above exclusion criteria regarding the exclusion and dismissal of students and staff. For students, the school is to immediately isolate the student from other students, notify the student's parent/guardian of the symptoms and that the student needs to be picked up as soon as possible, and immediately follow cleaning and disinfecting procedures for any area and materials with which the student was in contact. For staff, the school is to send the staff member home immediately and follow cleaning and disinfecting procedures for any area, materials, and equipment with which the staff member was in contact. If a school staff member must take a student's temperature at any point, they should follow CDC guidelines to do so safely, including with the use of barrier protection or Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). Exposure Reporting, Notification, and Disinfecting To ensure a clear and efficient process for communication, the school has identified Rochelle Bodie, Associate Director of Operations for Rocketship DC, as the internal COVID-19 point of contact (POC). This person is responsible for ensuring the below steps are followed in the event of a confirmed case of COVID-19. Step 1: Report to DC Health Department The school will follow existing procedures for reporting communicable disease. In the event of a confirmed case of COVID-19 in a student, staff member, or any individual who has entered the building, the school will notify DC Health by submitting the online case report (via this link). Step 2: Communication to Families and Staff Schools are to have communication protocols in place that protect the privacy of individuals and alert their families and staff to a COVID-19 case. Communication is to be completed, per DC Health directive and will include: Notification to all staff and families in the event of change of school schedule, Notification to those staff and families of students in close contact with the individual and will state the requirement to quarantine for 14 days; and Notification to the entire program that there was a COVID-19 positive case, those impacted have been told to quarantine, and all areas that the individual was in contact with will be cleaned, sanitized, and disinfected. Impacted families will find out via email, text, and letter. Step 3: Cleaning, Sanitization, and Disinfection of Affected Spaces In the event of a confirmed COVID-19 case in a student or staff member, the school must immediately close the room(s) the COVID-19 positive individual was in once all students in that group have exited the school and follow cleaning, disinfection and sanitization guidance from the CDC, linked here: If seven days or fewer have passed since the person who is sick used the facility, follow these steps: Close off areas used by the person who is sick.1. Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 28 Open outside doors and windows to increase air circulation in the areas.2. Wait up to 24 hours or as long as possible before cleaning or disinfecting to allow respiratory droplets to settle.3. Clean and disinfect all areas used by the person who is sick, such as classrooms, bathrooms, and common areas.4. If more than seven days have passed since the person who is sick used the facility, additional cleaning and disinfection is not necessary. Continue routine cleaning and disinfection. Student and Staff Schedule If / when we return in a hybrid schedule, Rocketship DC will operate a A/B Cohort model with a staggered start. Students will both arrive and dismiss in a staggered manner. In - Person Remote Week 1Kindergarten only (M/T or Th/F)1st - 5th Grade Week 2Kindergarten - 2nd Grade (M/T or Th/F)3rd - 5th Grade Week 3Kindergarten - 5th Grade (M/T or Th/F)N/A Attachment 1 - Cohort Schedule and Attachment 2 - Mustangs Cohort Example also depict the A/B Cohort model. Sample Staggered Dismissal: 2:45: Appletree - PK3 & PK4 3:00: Kindergarten / 1st Grade 3:15: 2nd / 3rd Grade 3:30: 4th / 5th Grade Distributing Educational Materials All materials will be sanitized prior to assigning to a student for the duration of its use. For students learning remotely, the materials will be available to the student during designated times throughout a number of school days. For students who are unable to travel to school, the materials will be dropped off at the student's resident. The student and family will sign an agreement to take care of the materials and follow school behavior policy. School materials that will be used by others (e.g. Chromebook, science lab equipment, textbooks) will be returned by the student following completion of the unit-of-study. The same process will be repeated for checking in materials. Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 29 Instructional units will alternate between groups, limiting the need to share materials. In the event that materials are shared between multiple groups or individuals, a thorough sanitation process will take place between users. Sample list of items assigned to each student. All classes: Chromebook, hotspot, pack of 10 no.2 pencils, a box of crayons, text books, etc. English: Reading books for independent, group, or class reading, notebook, etc. Science: lab materials, gloves, face conversing, etc. Math: Calculator, compass, etc. History/Social Studies: Reading and research materials Art: colored pencils, paper, watercolors Music: Music book, instrument (if applicable) Language: Earphones/headset, recording device, textbook PE/Health: individual unit packets, equipment (e.g. ball) Oversight of Before and After and Extracurricular Activities Rocketship DC has its own aftercare program, RocketBooster!. RocketBooster! will follow 100% of the same safety protocols outlined in this plan. RocketBooster! students will be grouped in the same cohort throughout the day and will remain with the same students and within the same classroom for aftercare as they will be in throughout the day. Any staff member working for RocketBooster! who is not part of the school staff must undergo the same health screenings prior to entering the building and working with students. Providing Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) All students will be provided with 5 reusable face masks to use throughout the year. If a student comes to school without a mask, the Health Screeners will have plenty of extra masks to provide the student with. All staff members will be provided with 5 reusable masks plus face shields to use during the year. If a staff member arrives at school without a mask, they will be able to receive one, as well, from the health screener for that day. Any visitor who is entering the building with permission will have access to face masks, as well. All health screeners will have full PPE at all times, including gloves, face masks, and face shields. Gowns are available as needed / requested. Plastic barriers have been placed at the front desk of each school to protect our front office staff, and all health screenings will take place outside. RPS will follow OSSE's updated guidance regarding PPE from 8-21-20. This includes the following: School staff must adhere to the guidance below at a minimum. These guidelines do not replace professional judgment, which must always be used to ensure the safest environment for staff and students. Note: Staff and children must practice good hand hygiene throughout all of the scenarios and maintain physical distance of six feet to the maximum extent feasible. Wearing gloves is not a substitute for good hand hygiene. Gloves must be changed between children and care activities, and hand hygiene must be performed between glove changes. If skin comes into contact with any secretions or bodily fluids, it must be immediately washed. Contaminated clothing must be immediately removed and changed. WORKING WITH STUDENTS WHO ARE NOT KNOWN OR NOT SUSPECTED TO HAVE COVID-19 Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 30 Lower Risk: 6 feet of physical distance cannot always be maintained. Close contact with secretions or bodily fluids is not anticipated. Non-medical (cloth) face covering Medium Risk: Staff are in close/direct contact with less than 6 feet of physical distance. Close contact with secretions or bodily fluids is possible or anticipated. Non-medical (cloth) face covering If potential for bodily fluids to be splashed or sprayed (e.g., student who is spitting, coughing; while providing a nebulized medication), instead use surgical mask and eye protection (face shield or goggles) Coverall Gloves must be used per existing procedures (e.g., when diapering, administering medication) Higher Risk: School nurses who are engaged in aerosol-generating procedures must follow additional guidance for Healthcare Providers per DC Health. WORKING WITH STUDENTS WHO ARE KNOWN OR SUSPECTED TO HAVE COVID-19 Staff working with any child who is known to have COVID-19 or who is exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19 must take additional steps. While responding briefly to a sick student, or while escorting a sick student to the isolation room: If the student is wearing a face covering (non-medical (cloth) or surgical mask), and is able to maintain 6 feet of distance, accompanying staff must wear: Non-medical (cloth) face covering If the student is not wearing a face covering (non-medical (cloth) or surgical mask), or is not able to maintain 6 feet of distance, accompanying staff must wear: Surgical mask o Eye protection (face shield or goggles) Coverall Gloves While supervising a sick student in the isolation room, staff must always wear: Surgical mask o Eye protection (face shield or goggles) Coverall (e.g., long sleeve button-down shirt) Gloves Note: The student in the isolation room must also wear a non-medical (cloth) face or surgical mask. The sick student and any staff accompanying or supervising them to/in the isolation room must safely remove and store their cloth face covering, or dispose of their surgical mask, after use Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 31 Instructional Delivery PlanCustodial Staff Non-medical (cloth) face covering Gown/coveral Gloves Other PPE may be needed based on cleaning/disinfectant products being used and whether there is a risk of splash. For more information, visit the CDC's website here. Classroom educators and staff who are cleaning and disinfecting areas or equipment utilized by a sick individual must follow Custodial Staff guidelines above. Classroom educators and staff doing routine cleaning (e.g., of high-touch surfaces) must wear non-medical (cloth) face covering and gloves. PURPOSE or PLAN STATEMENT: This plan describes how Rocketship DC will meet its mission, goals, and student academic achievement expectations as set forth in its charter agreement as well as provide the equivalent of 1,080 instructional hours through synchronous and asynchronous remote and on-site learning opportunities. The plan provides students, families, staff, DC PCSB and OSSE with a thorough understanding of the day-to-day learning. The plan centers on equity, ensuring that all students, including students who are at risk, per the city's definition, English learners, and/or with disabilities, are able to access all learning opportunities without further compromising their health and social-emotional well-being. DESCRIPTION: Instruction at Rocketship DC will be provided to meet the needs of family and staff regardless of whether the student is experiencing instruction remotely or on-site. This will allow for uninterrupted learning for students when health and safety guidance changes (such as moving from Phase II to Phase III) or when the school facility is closed to staff and students due to an acute outbreak or citywide declaration. For each of the 180 days in the school calendar, a student will be expected to engage in the equivalent of 6 hours of learning, with synchronous breaks for lunch, \"recess\" and socializing. The following options are available to families enrolling in Rocketship DC for school year 2020-21. Families must choose an option by August 1. On a quarterly basis and based on availability, families may change their option from 5.Describe how the LEA will deliver instruction in order to achievecontinuous learning during the 2020-21 school year. Identify the instructional methods(e.g., 100 percent synchronous instruction, student-guided instruction, etc.),and platforms (e.g., the product name if using a learning management system (LMS)),and materials (e.g., textbooks, teacher-generated resources, computer software, etc.) your schools will use during the 2020-21 school year to ensure rigor across settings; Explain the total instructional hours per day for the typical student participating in your distance learning program. Provide a breakdown of anticipated hours spent in a synchronous learning environment (learning that happens in real time with the student and teacher together) and asynchronous learningenvironment (independent learning that takes place without real-time input from the teacher); Describe the training and professional development for school staff to support the effective implementation of this instructional plan; and Describe the manner in which the LEA will ensure the plan is routinely monitored and adjusted, as needed, to address the needs of every student in the LEA across learning environments. Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 32 Remote to On-Site or Hybrid via a quarterly learning survey. School Schedule Options Hybrid Students in this model would attend school in-person for two days per week, and attend school remotely using synchronous activities with a content teacher two days a week. For asynchronous learning, students may work on a variety of activities, some of which may require students using computers, however, to meet family needs, in the event computers and internet access are unavailable, accommodations will be made for students to complete course work without technology to be submitted when in-person or through the use of photos. A full virtual option will also be available for families who chose to continue in this way on a quarterly basis. Attachment 3 - Cohort Hybrid Schedule depicts the schedule for in-person and virtual learning. On-site This option is open to all students whose parents are emergency workers or who otherwise determine that sending their child to a structured learning environment provided by the school is necessary for his or her continued growth and development, including, but not limited to, students with disabilities and English learners. In this option, the student will attend in-person synchronous learning four days a week. They will be under adult supervision on each day they are on campus. Remote Synchronous This option is for students who are immunocompromised or who have a family member who is immunocompromised or whose family would prefer that the child not attend school in-person. In this option, the students may experience learning from home four days a week via synchronous learning. The learning will primarily take place online via virtual classrooms. There will be dedicated small group instruction, socio-emotional learning time, enrichment, and the ability to children to opt into clubs based on personal interests. All instruction will happen in a virtual environment. Remote Asynchronous For students who are unable to attend synchronous learning when remote. This type of learning allows for weekend learning, when families may be more able to support students. Students will be able to access content teachers for pre-determined and communicated office hours throughout the school week.

To achieve this goal, and for purposes of equity and logistics, we have divided the role of \"teacher\" into two roles: Humanities/STEM Content Teacher and Supporting Teachers who are identified as Individualized Learning Specialist (ILS), Assistant Teachers, ATs and Enrichment Coordinators (ECCs). Supporting Individualized Learning Specialist, Enrichment Coordinator or Assistant Teacher: The Supporting Individualized Learning Specialist, Enrichment Coordinator or Assistant Teacher is the adult responsible for a group of students who, together, will be considered a \"class.\" Each day, the Supporting Individualized Learning Specialist, Enrichment Coordinator or Assistant Teacher will see some of their class on-site (the number depending on city guidance) and some remotely. This adult will be the teacher of record for attendance and will also be the primary contact for families. At RPS these adults are identified within the roles of Individualized Learning Specialist (ILS), Assistant Teachers, ATs and Enrichment Coordinators (ECCs). Refer to our attendance policy for how attendance will be determined, including the \"touchpoints\" that will be used. HUM/STEM Content Teacher: The teacher is the content area expert responsible for ensuring that students are learning. While a content teacher may also be a Supporting Individualized Learning Specialist, Enrichment Coordinator or Assistant Teacher, they may need to roam (physically and/or electronically) into other communities to provide content-rich instruction. The content teacher's primary responsibility is to ensure that content will be delivered remotely and in-person with equal success and be differentiated for all learners. Assistant Principal There is one Assistant Principal assigned to each grade level. The person will supervise classrooms on a rotating basis to allow the Supporting Individualized Learning Specialist, Enrichment Coordinator or Assistant Teacher to take scheduled breaks throughout the day as well as support coaching and development of content teachers. For remote learners, the Assistant principals will assume responsibility for the students showing severe or persistent signs of disengagement, help trouble-shoot engagement issues (IT, wrap around services, content), and triage support for the student as needed. Learning Modes Synchronous learning with HUM/STEM Content Teacher (SL w/CT) : When remote, this instruction is conducted via platforms Zoom and Seesaw, in which student(s) and teacher are interacting directly with one another. Instruction may be given via direct instruction or with students working on projects, monitored by the teacher. On-site, this instruction may include the teacher and student(s) occupying the same room. When remote, this instruction includes the teacher and student(s) using the same format: The expectation is that the student(s) may ask questions and the teacher may ask questions of the student(s) to engage in real time Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 34 student-learning. Asynchronous learning with HUM/STEM Content Teacher (ASL w/CT) : This instruction requires the teacher to prepare learning that can be accessed any-time, any-where. The student would need access to a pre- recorded lesson in which the teacher provides instruction. When learning on-site, this lesson could be provided by a Supporting Individualized Learning Specialist, Enrichment Coordinator or Assistant Teacher to minimize the circle of exposure. When remote, the lesson can be accessed by the student using their RPS assigned chromebook, logging into their Clever account and accessing the Seesaw platform to engage with instruction. All students will be supplied with an internet accessible Chromebook to access online content; additionally, Rocketship DC will ensure that all families have access to reliable internet through the use of hot spots and other means. Synchronous learning without Content Teacher (SL w/o CT) : Instruction takes the form of tasks that students will be expected to do to engage in learning. One way to think about this type of instruction is \"Guided Practice.\" Tasks can involve completing an on-line activity or game to reading a book in hardcopy and annotating the text. This can be group work or individual work. The student on-site would do this task under the supervision of their Supporting Individualized Learning Specialist, Enrichment Coordinator or Assistant Teacher. When remote, the student would do this task independently. If the student needs support, the teacher is immediately available by phone, email, text, or \"chat\". If the Supporting Individualized Learning Specialist, Enrichment Coordinator or Assistant Teacher happens to also be the content teacher assigning the work, support can be provided in-person. If the Supporting Individualized Learning Specialist, Enrichment Coordinator or Assistant Teacher is not the content teacher, the content teacher may provide support in the same manner as for students learning remotely, per the school's Technology Plan. Asynchronous learning without Content Teacher (ASL w/o CT) : This instruction is individual or group work that can be done independently. The work would be at the student's learning level, so they should not experience frustration, nor should it be too easy for them. The teacher will expect the work to be completed by a certain time each day or week. Students learning on-site would have time allotted to complete this work while their Supporting Individualized Learning Specialist, Enrichment Coordinator or Assistant Teacher may be providing instruction to another cohort of students. Homework also fits into this category. To ensure that the work is completed each day and students are engaged and progressing, assignments will be collected throughout the week and will be used as one way to measure attendance and engagement. (See attendance policy for further details.) The product of these work blocks are often referred to as \"exit tickets\" or \"student reflections.\" Community Building We know that, \"our families are especially vulnerable to the destabilizing impacts of the COVID-19 crisis. The vast majority of our families are classified as economically disadvantaged. The outcomes they faced are key factors that cause children to experience \"toxic stress\" which research has shown can derail student learning and delay child development.\" Research shows that embedding trauma based practices can help support this effort. We know best practices are consistency, routine, building relationships, helping students navigate skills that are \"appropriate\" in the school setting vs. other settings. Currently, our Social Emotional Learning (SEL) morning time holds enough time for our SEL content ( The Shortest Distance ). In order to meet the needs of our students, build community/culture, and have a strong start to our day we are creating a 30 minute \"Community Meeting Block\" to be incorporated in all bell schedules. The Community Meeting Block holds dual purposes: to deliver SEL content and build community. We are utilizing elements from Conscious Discipline's \"Smart Start\" to create our holistic Community Meeting block. The second component is an after lunch 15 minute \"SEL Check-In\" that will be incorporated into all bell schedules. Synchronized community building with a Supporting Individualized Learning Specialist, Enrichment Coordinator or Assistant Teacher (SL w/CL) : All students will participate in Social Emotional Learning at the start of the learning block for 30 minutes. The Community Meeting Block holds dual purposes: to deliver SEL content and build community. We are utilizing elements from Conscious Discipline's \"Smart Start\" to create our holistic Community Meeting block. The second component is an after lunch 15 minute \"SEL Check-In\" that will be incorporated into all bell schedules. Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 35 Asynchronized community building with a Supporting Individualized Learning Specialist, Enrichment Coordinator or Assistant Teacher (SL w/CL) : Adult-directed activities to build community, such as group projects, partner-work, and other opportunities for students both on-site and remote to connect with one another in informal ways. Synchronized community building without a Supporting Individualized Learning Specialist, Enrichment Coordinator or Assistant Teacher (SL w/o CL) : Planned breaks during offline work time as well as through afternoon student clubs will include activities students can choose to do with each other virtually. Such activities can include games (on-line trivial pursuit, scavenger hunts, etc.), interest clubs run by our Supporting Individualized Learning Specialist, Enrichment Coordinator or Assistant Teachers that students can engage in while the teacher is not necessarily able to provide instruction. When on-site, the Supporting Individualized Learning Specialist, Enrichment Coordinator or Assistant Teacher would supervise for appropriate social distancing and other behavior. For remote learners, the school's behavior policy will be in place and consequences or redirection will be given to perpetrators of reported and verified incidences. Asynchronized community building without a Supporting Individualized Learning Specialist, Enrichment Coordinator or Assistant Teacher (SL w/o CL) : To accommodate arrival and dismissal, lunch periods, and other breaks for on-site community learners, each class will have a slightly different schedule. Students will be encouraged to socialize with classmates within their cohorts during the hour-long arrival block, lunch, and dismissal block when learning remotely. There will be a continuously growing database of school-approved and provided web-based games, log-in software, and/or equipment (e.g. Chromebook, hotspot, etc.), that students may use at any time so long as they follow the school culture and behavior policy, including cyber bullying. The unstructured time with friends allows for a deepening affinity to the community. Professional Development Over the summer, content teachers will receive training on the Virtual learning instructional tools used by Rocketship Public Schools. These platforms include, Google Classroom, Seesaw, Peardeck and Zoom which will be provided by our instructional content teams and school specific school leaders. The training will focus on content delivery and checking for understanding. In addition, all staff will receive professional development on Wednesdays. The development will focus on assessing student learning, school wide instructional focus areas, student engagement, and building community when remote. Teachers will also support one another and collaborate on Wednesdays. On Wednesdays, both teacher and Supporting Individualized Learning Specialist, Enrichment Coordinator or Assistant Teachers receive professional development and are given time to collaborate and develop intervention support plans for students who show signs of disengagement. Every day, the Content Teacher will have time built into the instructional day to work with special education providers and English language specialists. Additionally, formal instruction will end each day by 3pm and the teacher's work day will end at 5pm. Each day, teachers and Supporting Individualized Learning Specialist, Enrichment Coordinator or Assistant Teachers will have access to the IT support specialist, behavioral support specialist, support staff, assistant principals and grade leads, and other instructional staff to troubleshoot issues that occur both on-site and remote. Timely Intervention With the support of the Supporting Individualized Learning Specialist, Enrichment Coordinator or Assistant Teacher and assistant principals, the teacher will get weekly reports on each of their students to supplement information they are gleaning from formative assessments. When needed, the Supporting Individualized Learning Specialist, Enrichment Coordinator or Assistant Teacher will contact the family daily to determine if a student is disengaging and why. The Supporting Individualized Learning Specialist, Enrichment Coordinator or Assistant Teacher and assistant principal will triage issues and refer other specialists to support a student or family, such as: Information technology, counseling, and learning. Continuous Improvement Rocketship DC will be in operation for 180 days. The schedule will be based on a quarter system to allow for Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 36 updates and changes to meet the immediate needs and to adjust to the latest DC reopening phase. All changes to school scheduling will occur on the planned quarter start date (e.g.,November 9) except when there is an emergency reason to move from on-site to remote learning. The instructional schedule will be different from the on-site schedule, which will be based on the family needs for an on-site learning environment. Families may choose to change their schedule on an as-needed basis with direct communication with the school. The school will accommodate all families for the start of each quarter and adjust as best as possible throughout a quarter. A survey will be sent out 3 weeks before the end of each quarter to give families the option to switch. Once a week, on Wednesdays, the school will engage in a school-wide data analysis of student performance on formative assessments, disaggregated by schedule type (hybrid, on-site, remote synchronous, remote asynchronous). The analysis will control for other variables (e.g. housing instability, special education status) to confirm that each mode of content instruction is providing equitable results for student learning and growth. Future professional development will be planned based on the results of the analysis, RPS community engagement tracker and staff development needs. If it is determined that some instructional strategies are more (or less) effective than others, these will be replicated, replacing the less effective strategies. Once a month, students, who have shown the least engagement whether by attendance or work product, will be evaluated through a student support team. The team will determine the potential cause of disengagement, from equipment or Wifi issues, to mental health to difficulties with content. Depending on the results, student's may be modified to include additional intervention as deemed appropriate by the intervention teams. All students will take a social emotional learning assessment at least three times per year. Based on the results, modifications will be made to the learning plan for cohorts or individual students. Example Classrooms 30 students: Demographics: 5 (17%) students with disabilities, 3 (10%) English learners, 23 (77%) at-risk (including three who are homeless/housing insecure) Based on parent survey results and follow up conversations, the students will attend as described below when we are able to open in a hybrid model: 13 (43%) will be Hybrid learners 6 Hybrid-Group A (1 is an English learner) 7 Hybrid-Group B (2 have a disability requiring modifications and aides) 5 (17%) On-site (2 have disability requiring modifications aides, 1 is an English learner) 12 Remote (40%) (1 has a disability requiring modifications, 1 is an English learner) If this elementary class is taught by a teacher who is immune compromised and cannot be safely in school with students. An instructional aide is assigned to be the Supporting Individualized Learning Specialist, Enrichment Coordinator or Assistant Teacher.

NWEA-MAP ; Other (identify vendor) 6a.Describe the LEA's policy for identifying and administering assessments during the 2020-21 school year, including: Which formative assessment(s) the LEA will use to measure student learning (and learning loss) at the start of the 2020-21 school year? 6b.Describe the LEA's policy for identifying and administering assessments during SY 2020-21, including: How the LEA will plan to assess students who either do not attend school regularly in person, or who participate exclusively in distance learning. Describe the specific modalities you plan to use to ensure every student is assessed (e.g., at-home diagnostic assessments, online proctoring, physically in the building). Describe if modalities differ by grade bands; and When the LEA intends to administer these assessments during the school year, specifying for each assessment. Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 40 PURPOSE STATEMENT: Rocketship DC is responsible for meeting the goals and student academic achievement expectations as set forth in its charter. It is also requesting from the Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) a waiver from offering six hours of instruction each day. The policy below describes Rocketship DC's commitment to assessing and learning. This policy supports the school's charter and does not replace the commitments set forth within. DESCRIPTION: This policy describes the formative assessments that Rocketship DC will use to assess student learning during the 2020-2021 school year. These assessments are not considered part of high stakes accountability and student test results will not be shared with DC PCSB nor OSSE unless the test is explicitly defined in the school's charter agreement. Results of all assessments will be shared with the student and parent/guardian and used to inform interventions and student grades. The policy describes the formative assessments the school is considering administering for all students by grade bands, and for students who participate exclusively in remote learning, when each assessment will be administered, and the manner in which the LEA will provide academic intervention and support across both learning environments - in person and distance. The policy also identifies changes to grade level promotion requirements. Changes codified in this policy for graduation requirements will be assumed into the school's charter agreement as a waiver for SY2020-21, SY2021-22, SY2022-23, SY2023-24 , as all students will not have the benefit of all courses. Assessment Integrity Rocketship DC has adopted a two-part assessment integrity plan to ensure that the assessments are valid, reliable and measuring student learning. First, all families will sign testing integrity agreements that include the parameters in which families, classmates, and others may help students on assessments and how the internet and other resources may be used during assessments. The second part is a change in school formative assessment practice. In order to remain focused on the purpose and benefits of assessments, rather than consuming resources on the fear of cheating, all assessments will be chosen with the assumption that 1) students will be talking to classmates, 2) family members will help, and 3) students have access to the Internet, books, and/or other resources. We will conduct additional data analyses after testing to get an idea of how much additional support students had during testing.

If the LEA is not changing its grading and promotion policy to accommodate distance learning, the LEA may provide a link to the policy or describe the existing policy. Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 42 Considerations Students in all grade levels at Rocketship DC will still have access in a virtual environment to all key aspects of our core content, including Humanities, STEM, personalized learning, Enrichment, Physical Education, and more. While some of these may look different, they will be readily available for all students. Promotion Rocketship DC's promotion policies will remain the same, and are outlined below. Rocketship's instructional model is organized so that each student's learning plan is individualized in order to account for individual differences and promote academic and social growth. As such, we believe that retention should only be used in rare and exceptional circumstances, when the student's family is given notice well in advance and is fully in support of the retention decision. Rocketship's retention and acceleration policy is deliberately flexible so that teams can consider each student as an individual and make recommendations based on data and identified student need. The purpose of this policy is to provide school teams with a framework for considering retention, promotion, or acceleration that is consistent with our philosophy of education. Additionally, the procedures are designed to ensure that retained students receive the supplemental, targeted instruction and support that they require in order to make adequate academic gains in subsequent years. This policy addresses guiding principles that will inform retention and acceleration decisions; considerations that Rocketship will use when promoting and accelerating students, and considerations for retention, including timelines for identification, factors that could lead to retention, retention procedures and appeals (including for students with IEPs), retention plans, and documentation requirements. Guiding Principles for Retention, and AccelerationI. All Rocketship schools are expected to adhere to the guidelines below when making decisions on retention and acceleration. Students vary considerably in their rate of development. Factors that affect development include chronological age, communication skills, academic ability, social, physical, and emotional maturity, attendance, cognitive ability, etc. Some children may benefit from more time in a given grade level, if the curriculum is suited to their needs and they continue to be socially well-adjusted to their peer group. Children who perform at exceptionally high levels in relation to their grade-level peers and are developmentally (physically and mentally) on-level may benefit from acceleration to the next grade level. School teams must use great care when making recommendations regarding retention and acceleration in order to ensure the greatest likelihood that it is an effective intervention. Emotional maturity and social adjustment concerns should be evaluated when considering whether or not to retain or accelerate a student. Educators must consider the academic needs of a child when determining acceleration as well as emotional maturity, physical maturity, and social adjustment. School leaders will consider myriad factors including both absolute performance and growth/progress made on assessments when ascertaining whether or not students are academically prepared to move on to the next grade level. As described in Rocketship's Admissions Policy, schools typically should not make decisions regarding retention or acceleration during the enrollment process. Schools are expected to enroll all students in the next consecutive grade level and then assess students as needed. Students will be considered for retention or acceleration at the following grade levels: Between grades 1 and 2 Between grades 2 and 3 Between grades 3 and 4 Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 43 Between grades 4 and 5 Considerations for RetentionII. Early Identification Students will be identified as at-risk for retention as early in the school year as is practicably feasible. Parents will be notified no later than mid-school year when a student is identified as being at risk of retention. Parents will participate in the decision-making process when considering retention, as further described below. Indicators to Review When Considering Retention The following indicators of academic achievement should be considered when making retention decisions: Consistent scores in the bottom quartile of assessments (i.e. state assessments, NWEA, math or ELA benchmarks). Failure to make adequate academic progress when compared to peers (i.e. data shows that rate of improvement is considerably less accelerated than class average). Failure to make adequate progress towards individual goals after receiving evidence-based interventions, implemented with treatment integrity. Severe social or emotional immaturity when compared to peers that causes harm to the student's academic, behavioral, and/or social-emotional development. Excessive absences (i.e. more than 20).\" Recommendation of student's teachers that retention is or is not an appropriate option, with supporting rationale. Parent buy-in in regards to retention or not. These indicators must be evident despite having received interventions before retention should be considered. Procedures for Retention Student progress will be monitored using a variety of assessments (NWEA, statewide assessments, benchmark assessments, progress monitoring data, etc.) School staff will notify parents when a student is at risk for retention, Parents should be notified of the at-risk status as early as possible, and, to the extent feasible, no later than 60 calendar days prior to the end of the school year If retention is being considered, a Student Study Team (SST) shall be convened consisting of at least a School Leader, the student's classroom teacher, an Individualized Learning Specialist, and the student's parent/guardian. The SST will consult in accordance with the guiding principles described above and will arrive at a mutually agreed- upon decision. The Principal will have authority over confirmation of final retention decisions, The parent of the student who is being considered for retention will be provided with objective evidence supporting the retention recommendation using the Retention Recommendation form. Parents must confirm their agreement with the recommendation for retention before the end of the school year in writing, via the Retention Recommendation form. Kindergarten students who have completed one year of kindergarten shall be admitted to first grade unless the parent /guardian and Rocketship agree that the student shall continue in kindergarten for not more than one additional school year. Whenever a student continues in kindergarten for an additional year, the Chief Executive Officer shall secure an agreement, signed by the parent/guardian, stating that the student shall continue in kindergarten for not more than one additional school year. English Language Learners For the English language learner, retention decisions shall be based on the student's rate of English acquisition rather 8.Public Charter High Schools Only: If a high school in your charter LEA has any school specific graduation Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 44 than on lack of grade-level English language proficiency or mastery of core academic content standards. Retention Intervention Plans For students who will be retained, the SST will develop an intervention plan which details the supplemental interventions and supports that will be made available to the student using Rocketship's \"Retention Intervention Plan\" template. During the subsequent school year, school leaders are responsible for continuing to monitor the academic progress of all retained students and reconvening the SST to make changes to the intervention plan when necessary. Documentation At the end of the school year, the Principal is responsible for maintaining documentation of the following information. The student's name; The underlying reason for the retention decision; Whether the principal identified the student as at risk of retention; Whether the principal provided written notice to the student's parents within 60 calendar days of the last day of school. Considerations for AccelerationIII. Acceleration is the process of advancing students at a more rapid rate than experienced by most, and may be considered when students are performing significantly above grade level. Procedures for Acceleration A student may be recommended for acceleration by a teacher, counselor, or the parent /guardian if the student is exceeding grade level standards in reading and /or math. A student recommended for acceleration will take the NWEA MAP or other state assessments at the grade level for which he/she is recommended. If acceleration is being considered, a Student Study Team (SST) shall be convened consisting of at least a The Principal, School Leader, the student's classroom teacher, an Individualized Learning Specialist, and the student's parent/guardian. The SST will consult to review the student's performance in accordance with the guiding principles described above and will arrive at a mutually agreed-upon decision. The SST Team should consider the following indicators when determining whether a student should be accelerated to another grade level. Exceeding grade-level standards on school work, such as classwork, quizzes, tests, and Projects. Scoring in the 99th percentile on state testing. Scores in the 75th percentile on standardized assessments in the grade level to which the student is being recommended for acceleration (i.e. NWEA MAP, math or ELA benchmarks). Academic, behavioral, and/or social-emotional development. The Principal will make the final acceleration decision based on the SST's recommendation. The parent of the student who is being considered for acceleration will be provided with objective evidence supporting the acceleration recommendation. Parents must confirm their agreement with the recommendation for acceleration before the end of the school year in writing. Students with IEPSIV. requirements (i.e., courses, projects, or presentations) that exceed the requirements in 5-A DCMR \u00a72203 and Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 45 At Rocketship Public Schools we support every Rocketeer to be successful both academically and in their social emotional development. Rocketship Education is committed to making our schools a viable option for all students and families, including students with disabilities. As our population of students with more significant disabilities has increased over the last several years, the Special Education team has been hard at work developing innovative systems for supporting these students. At all of our campuses, students have the right to access the full continuum of services. One of the structures within Rocketship that supports this program is our Specialized Inclusion Program, which is housed at select Rocketship sites. For students with Individualized Education Programs (IEPs), the full continuum of services includes access to a special day class, nonpublic school, or residential care, while enrolled at RPS, as required by state and federal law and according to each students' respective Individualized Education Program (IEP). Decisions regarding retention or acceleration for a student with an IEP are made in consultation with the IEP team and review of the Individualized Education Program. We follow the acceleration or retention process for students with IEPs to ensure we are thoughtfully considering a student's IEP and progress. Appealing Retention or Acceleration DecisionsV. The Principal must notify parents /guardians in writing of their right to appeal a retention or acceleration decision. Parents must submit an appeal in writing to the Principal within ten (10) days of the decision. Appeals shall be heard by a designee of the Board of Directors' Academic Affairs Committee, who will consider information provided by Parent, the SST recommendation, and any other information shared by the Principal. The designee's decision shall be final. This question is not applicable to Rocketship Public Schools Option A: The LEA is using a learning management system (LMS) for distance learning. How is the student's presence authenticated daily using the LMS? What constitutes sufficient engagement in the LMS for the student to be marked present? PURPOSE STATEMENT: Rocketship DC commits to meeting its goals and academic achievement expectations as set forth in its charter and requests a waiver from OSSE for six-hours of \"seat time\" per instructional day. Attendance for remote learners is paramount to achieving both objectives. This policy reflects how remote attendance will be captured. DESCRIPTION: ON-SITE ATTENDANCEare outlined in your school's charter that you plan to waive for SY 2020-21, describe those waived requirements. 9.OSSE has issued guidance on the collection of student attendance for SY 2020-21. Describe the LEA's policy for student attendance through distance learning. In your response, be sure to identify whether the LEA is using Option A and/or Option B. The LEA should respond to the questions associated with each response. In crafting your response, note the following: Schools are expected to implement their normal, in-person attendance policies and procedures when students are on school grounds LEAs that serve students that are not compulsory age (pre-K 3, pre-K 4, and Adult) are not required to abide by the above attendance policy. However, they should describe their attendance expectations and policies for students. Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 46 Per OSSE guidance, a student will be marked full-day present, partial-day present, or absent and will align to existing DC PCSB-approved LEA attendance policy. DISTANCE LEARNING ATTENDANCE Per OSSE guidance for distance learning, students will be marked present or absent using the new codes for Distance Learning (PFDL, AFUDL, AFEDL). Rocketship DC PCS will use various Learning Management Systems (LMS) and touchpoints to track student attendance and engagement. Rocketship DC PCS will use a combination of the following methods, depending on the lesson plans for the day, to track student attendance and engagement throughout the course of the day: Tracking zoom attendance during Living teaching blocks Social Groups Work Completion in See Saw ST Math Lexia Freckle Lightsail Google Classroom 1:1 or small group Coaching Sessions Follow Up phone calls with absent students / families Daily community meetings Launch Landing Social Emotional Learning Opportunities SEL Block (Community Meeting) SEL Closing Instruction for PK3 and PK4 students is provided through Rocketship's partnership with Appletree. Rocketship works closely with Appletree through implementation of their normed practices. The methods for tracking PK3 and PK4 student attendance are described below. All students will participate in a combination of the following live instruction activities through the week: Community Connections, Small Group/1 on 1 instruction, Read Alouds and Learning Lab. Each component is tracked as an \"engagement\" and monitored by teachers and school staff in an internal Engagement tracker. This data is used to identify trends, areas of need, and to work collaboratively with families to ensure each student is getting the appropriate support. Some engagements require electronics, i.e. iPads, with live synchronous instruction via Google Meet. These engagements will be tracked if students are there for the live instructions. Other engagements, such as independent work will be tracked by parent acknowledgement of participation in tasks via one of our tacking tools. Per OSSE guidance for distance learning, students will be marked present or absent using the new codes for Distance Learning codes. AppleTree will use various Learning Management Systems (LMS) and touchpoints to track student attendance and engagement. AppleTree will use a combination of the following methods, depending on the lesson plans for the day, to track student attendance and engagement throughout the course of the day: Tracking GoogleMeet attendance during Live Community Connections Live small group 1 on 1 instruction Work Completion Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 47 Class Dojo Sparkler ECR@Home Follow Up phone calls with absent students / families Connection phone calls with related service providers and other members of the schools' support team Grade Span Considerations Kindergarten - 5th Grade All K-5 elementary students will participate in the following components each day, with a varying schedule based on grade level, cohort, and student need. Each component is tracked as an \"engagement\" and monitored by teachers and school staff in an internal Engagement tracker. This data is used to identify trends, areas of need, and to work collaboratively with families to ensure each student is getting the appropriate support. Some engagements require electronics, i.e. chromebooks, with live synchronous instruction via Zoom. These engagements will be tracked if students are there for the lessons. Other engagements, such as independent work and Online Learning Programs, will be tracked using the work students are required to submit electronically (PDFs, photo evidence, etc.) or through the data systems associated with the programs that teachers will track daily. The daily components include: Launch (daily community meeting) Live SEL Lesson Live Humanities Teaching Independent Humanities work (monitored by a staff member) Life STEM Teaching Independent STEM work (monitored by a staff member) Small group Humanities and STEM live lessons Recorded Humanities and STEM modules (independent with associated work to complete) Enrichment / Club live opportunities, including PE Landing (daily closing community meeting) Wellness live groups (as needed for identified students) Special Education live instruction (as needed for students with IEPs). Related Service Provider live engagements, including Reading Partners (as needed for identified students) Students will be expected to engage with all of these daly components and they will be tracked in the internal school specific Engagement Dashboards. Option B: The LEA is not using a learning management system (LMS) for distance learning. What is the complete listing of acceptable methods for making one-on-one contact with the student authenticate a student's presence? What is the procedure the LEA will use to make one-on-one contact with the student to authenticate a student's presence? What constitutes evidence of education engagement daily for the student to be marked present? The non LMS touchpoints to track student attendance and engagement are integrated in the response for Option A. Attendance Monitoring and Reporting10.How will the LEA collect, verify, enter, and store supporting data (based on its selection[s] above) to ensure that the official attendance records of students are accurate? What student-level data specifically would be furnished to OSSE in the event of an audit of attendance records? Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 48 Rocketship DC PCS will take the following steps to track student attendance and address absences: The first period teacher takes attendance each morning by 8:45am in PowerTeacher or DeansList using the appropriate attendance code. On-Site Attendance: Present in classrooma. Distance Learning Attendance: Present during first living teaching blockb. 1. At 9:15 am each morning, the school's Office Manager (OM) runs the Attendance Report to identify any teacher who has not submitted attendance.2. If all attendance is not submitted, the OM prompts teacher(s) to send attendance and then runs and downloads the Absentee Report at 9:30 am (or when all attendance is received).3. OM sends a call to families of all absent students via Alert Solutions at 9:30 am. OM updates attendance for in-person students whose families have called back or arrived late with the appropriate partial presence or absence attendance code.a. If parents provide excused absence documentation within five days, OM scans the documentation and updates the student's attendance with appropriate excused absence code, noting the absence reason.b. OM uploads all Absentee Reports and scanned excused absence documentation in the shared Google drive (DC Attendance Folder) by the end of the week.c. 4. If students are not in the zoom rooms, teachers and/or ILS teachers will check OLP and classwork, then call to confer with those students that participated digitally to determine student attendance for that day.5. Model of Attendance Policy On-site synchronousOn-site asynchronousRemote synchronousRemote asynchronous Present Remote: Student presence is detected throughout school day's activities (A) captured in LMS (B) participates by one or more of the following touchpoints: is \"seen\" in virtual classroom, submits exit ticket participates in group activities participates in community building activities(games, etc.) Submits photo of student work Submits video of activity (e.g. PE, music) Saves student work in file, showing some progress Parent/guardian responds to survey Responds to documented Present Remote: Student responds to email AND fully or partially completes >50% of the day's assignments.

A call from the engagement specialist following up on email to the student. A call from the engagement specialist to family, if applicable. A robo call to the family notifying them of the student's absence from school, if applicable. Collecting and Reporting System The school will use both Deanslist and Powerschool to monitor attendance and track notifications that have been sent to families. For students who are marked \"absent\", the school's in-person attendance policy with consequences will be followed for reporting requirements and attendance verification. 11.Describe the LEA's plan for supporting students' social-emotional and mental health needs during Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 50 PURPOSE or POLICY STATEMENT: This Whole Student Support policy is intended to supplement existing family and student policies. This policy will provide guidance for students engaged in continuous education while in a remote setting and ensure that all students have access to high quality, equitable instruction. DESCRIPTION: Important Definitions Continuous education - This takes place when both instruction and learning occur seamlessly across different learning environments, including in-person and remote settings . Virtual learning - Learning hosted outside of a classroom setting using electronic devices Asynchronous learning - Learning where students learn the same material at different times and locations. Synchronous learning - Learning where students are engaging in learning activities at the same time. Discussion board - Section of a website where users can submit or read messages. Chat - A window used for conferencing between two users. Breakout Room - Virtual rooms that can be created within a meeting or training session for smaller groups to talk or collaborate. Cyberbullying - Willful and repeated harm inflicted through the use of computers, cell phones, and other electronic devices . Learning management system (LMS) - A software application for the hosting and delivering of online educational courses. Student Support According to the American Academy of Pediatricians, \"Remote learning is likely to result in severe learning loss and increased social isolation. Social isolation, in turn, can breed serious social, emotional and health issues: child and adolescent physical or sexual abuse, substance use, depression, and suicidal ideation. Furthermore, these impacts will be visited more severely on Black and brown children, as well as low-income children and those with learning disabilities.\" Below are several interventions for students' social-emotional and mental health needs during continuous learning and school recovery. Teachers will embed social-emotional and wellness checks within daily asynchronous and synchronous classroom lessons. Teachers will lead daily Community Meetings using Rocketship's social-emotional learning curriculum \"The Shortest Distance.\" Teachers will use the literature in the curriculum to engage students in meaningful conversations about their actions and choices as well as the world around them. Teachers and Wellness Team members will encourage and remind students to utilize regulation skills and strategies when needed. Teachers and Supporting Individualized Learning Specialist, Enrichment Coordinator or Assistant Teachers will conference with families and if necessary, refer students to the Wellness Team for students displaying needs for support. The Wellness Team will provide weekly social skills groups, topic groups, and emotional regulation groups through the LMS for students identified as needing additional social, emotional, behavioral support. School administration will model social-emotional and wellness checks during teacher professional learning time that can be used in the classroom and to support the social-emotional and wellness needs of classroom teachers. The Wellness Team will create tele-health options for students to call and schedule sessions with school counselors, social workers, and external partners. The Wellness Team will make referrals to neighborhood Family and Support Collaboratives and external partners for families in need of additional social-emotional and mental health support. Wellness surveys will be regularly sent out to families to gauge their well-being and provide resources or support as appropriate.continuous learning and school recovery. Also describe how, during your planning, the LEA will identify and provide academic intervention to students who have lost the most learning due to COVID-19. Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 51 B. Behavior Schools are expected to implement their normal, in-person discipline policies and procedures when students are on school grounds. Per the Student Fair Access to School Amendment Act of 2018 , a suspension is defined as a student not being permitted on school grounds. An exclusion is defined as excluding the student from the school's educational program. Students who are not permitted to participate in synchronous learning must still be allowed to complete all assignments and access all educational materials.Teachers will complete a social, emotional, behavioral screener every quarter to help identify students who need additional social-emotional support. Rocketship Public Schools understands that many of our students will experience significant learning loss due to COVID-19. In order to fully understand the extent of this loss, we plan on implementing the following baseline assessments in the first month of school: Foundational Literacy Skills Assessment (Kindergarten and 1st grade; internal assessment) STEP Literacy assessment (K-5) Math Fluency assessment (K-5; internal assessment) NWEA Reading and Math (K-5) Teachers and staff will compare this assessment data with assessment data we have from last year to understand the extent of learning loss for each student. This foundational data will then be used for the following academic interventions: Guided reading small group instruction (Reading) Leveled Literacy Intervention (LLI) intervention groups (Reading) Differentiated Phonics Instruction (Reading) Small Group Math Instruction (Math) Online Learning Program differentiated assignments - Freckle, Reflex, Lexia (Math and Reading) Additionally, Rocketship implements Tier 2 and Tier 3 interventions for the bottom 25 and 10% of students at each grade level, respectively, outside of regular classroom instruction. These precentages may vary depending on the data we receive in our month 1 assessments. We will use the foundational data from month 1 of this year to create targeted intervention groups based on student needs. These groups meet for a 6-8 week cycle with regular progress monitoring throughout. They are pulled during the Small Group instruction portion of our day by staff members trained in the different interventions. Groups are re-created based on progress monitoring and formative data every 6-8 weeks. Expectations for Student Behavior:12.Describe the LEA's policy for monitoring student behavior during distance learning. All parts of the distance learning discipline policy must be compliant with applicable local and federal law (e.g., limits on total days excluded, restrictions on reasons a student may be excluded). Your policy must include: A list of behaviors that could result in a student being excluded from distance learning (e.g., inappropriate conduct on virtual platforms); The manner in which the LEA will communicate with families of students who are excluded from distance learning; and The manner in which you will ensure that students who are excluded from distance learning have access to missed work. Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 52 Expected behavior for students who are learning remotely are similar to those for the physical school community. Students are expected to treat their teachers, classmates, staff, and physical and virtual environment with respect. The virtual learning environment requires additional expectations to ensure that students have a safe, high quality learning experience while outside of the school building. Model Plan Communication and Student EngagementStudents must communicate and engage respectfully with their classmates and their teacher while in class meetings, breakout rooms, private/public chat windows, and discussion boards. Students must use the chat box and attendee features for the sole purpose of participating in, enhancing, and supporting the discussion topic. Students must follow all classroom and school expectations for using audio, video, and chat features during classroom meeting times. Students must be dressed in school appropriate clothes while using the video function on the LMS. Students must mute their microphones when they are not speaking and while others are speaking. Students must refrain from sharing inappropriate pictures or images during classroom meetings or on discussion boards. Students must follow the same rules for whole group class meetings while in breakout rooms. Students must immediately return to whole group meetings once breakout rooms are over unless otherwise directed by the teacher. Students must report to classroom meetings on time and remain in classroom meetings until being dismissed by the teacher. Students must not post any private information for themselves or others such as addresses, phone numbers or passwords on public chat or discussion boards. Students must refrain from any forms of cyberbullying - harassing, threatening or abusing others within the school community while online. Students must report all instances of cyberbullying or inappropriate action to school staff immediately. Logging into the LMSStudents must keep their username and passwords in a safe place and must not share them with other students. Students must log into the LMS using their own log-in information. Students must log into the LMS daily for classroom meetings, announcements, or to submit assignments. Students must use their first and last name as their user/profile name. Student WorkStudents must complete work on time following the guidelines requested by the teacher for submission. Students should contact their teacher if they need additional time to complete assignments. Students must submit their own work and provide citations for work created by others. Students must communicate immediately with their teachers via email, phone or text if they have questions or require any technical support. Students must treat all school and personal electronic devices with care. Students must keep food and drinks away from the equipment. Students must keep devices out of extremely cold or hot areas. Students must only use computers for school related activities.Taking Care of Physical Equipment Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 53 Students must hold and carry computers properly. Students must only use their assigned computer. Students must report any damage to school equipment as soon as possible. Monitoring of Student Behavior Administration/teachers will regularly review student discussion boards to make sure comments are appropriate. Administrators and additional staff members will pop-in frequently to observe classroom meetings. Teachers will provide ongoing reminders for students about classroom expectations within a virtual setting. Teachers will utilize least invasive techniques to redirect students when undesired behaviors are displayed. School staff will regularly remind students of expectations for taking care of personal/school-issued equipment. Staff members will be responsible for supporting students and families with navigating the LMS and be available to provide students with technical support. School staff will continue to track student participation and engagement with the LMS. Teachers will communicate concerns with families by phone, email, text or using the LMS. Communication with Families School staff will share a copy of the Whole Student Support Plan with families for their review prior to the beginning of the school year. Teachers will communicate with families on a weekly basis about student attendance, progress, and/or student engagement by email, phone, text or via the LMS. School staff will immediately communicate with students and families when students are not meeting expectations for distance learning. Alternatives to Distance Learning School staff may limit or restrict students' access to synchronous learning opportunities if they repeatedly fail to meet expectations for distance learning. Parents/guardians will be immediately notified about any changes to students' access to the LMS by email, phone, text or through the LMS. If students do not follow expectations for communicating or engaging respectfully with school staff or other students: School staff will remind students of expectations for distance learning. School staff will conference with families about school expectations not being met. Teachers may temporarily adjust students audio, video or chat privileges during synchronous meetings. Teachers may temporarily limit students' ability to post content on LMS chat or discussion boards. Teachers will follow their school procedures in documenting undesired behaviors. If these interventions are not successful in changing students behavior, teachers may request support from the Wellness Team. With students who need support, Wellness Team members will guide them in a time of reflection, teach them replacement behaviors, and support their transition into the learning environment. If students continue to display undesired behaviors, staff can discuss their concerns in student huddle meetings. Additional strategies and supports will then be identified and tracked for 4-6 weeks. If progress is not made after interventions are implemented for 4-6 weeks, a Student Study Team meeting will be held with all stakeholders. A behavior support plan will be created and progress will be tracked for 4-6 weeks. Plans will be revisited regularly to check for progress and effectiveness. If students use the LMS inappropriately, such as share their username/passwords, intentionally misuse the LMS or log in as another user: School staff will remind students of expectations for distance learning. School staff will conference with families about school expectations not being met. If students engage in cyberbullying or display/share inappropriate images on the LMS: Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 54 Special Populations LEAs' obligations to serve the District's English Learners (ELs) are outlined in U.S. Department of Education Fact Sheet , District Municipal Regulations 5-E3101 , OSSE's state EL policies and procedures , and DC PCSB EL Services Assurance Letter , and OSSE's Serving English Learners During Distance Learning FAQ.School staff will remind students of expectations for distance learning. School staff will notify the school social worker or counselor so that they can talk to the students and guide them in a time of reflection and restorative conversations. School social workers or counselors will document all cyberbullying incidents. School staff will conference with families about school expectations not being met.

DESCRIPTION: Rocketship will cont inue to follow IDEA timelines to to the greatest extent possible. We will have an increased amount of IEP Meetings at the beginning of the school year as a result of school closure. The implications are outlined in more detail below. As a result, we have narrowed the focus of IEP meetings for the launch of the 20.21 school year. Rocketship Public Schools will be creating procedures to ensure that we are consistently in compliance with all IDEA provisions.13.Describe the LEA's plan to serve students with disabilities, including: A description of how the LEA is maintaining IDEA timelines in collaboration with families and documenting delivered services; The steps the LEA is taking to ensure that family members with disabilities (e.g., a guardian with visual impairment) can access content to support their students' learning; and The manner in which LEA deliver related services for students in distance learning; The manner in which the LEA will support parent training for students receiving related services through distance learning; The manner in which LEAs will deliver recovery services to students with disabilities during the 2020-21 school year and how LEAs will communicate those services to families; The steps LEAs will take to ensure that students with disabilities are assessed upon return to school to determine the nature and severity of the impact of learning loss on their receipt of educational benefit; and The steps LEAs will take to support the delivery of recovery services to students in the care of the District of Columbia and students experiencing homelessness. Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 55 First Six Weeks of School 30 Day IEPs Assessment Plans for Reevaluations that were delayed Delayed Annuals If needed, adjustments of how services are written to align with instructional s Weeks 6-8 Regression & Recoupment Review Comp Ed Determination Schedule Adjustments & IEP Meetings During distance learning, parent requests for evaluations will be documented in SEDs. The School Psych, Associate Director of ISE, and/or Program Specialist, School Leader and grade-level ISE Specialist and General Education Teacher will meet to complete the Analysis of Existing Data and determine if it is possible to move forward with an evaluation. At this time, Rocketship is developing a safety and logistics plan in order to complete some assessments to the greeted extent possible. This plan will have to be approved by the board and meet DC COVID guidelines in order to be implemented and for assessments to be completed during Distance Learning. The steps the LEA is taking to ensure that family members with disabilities (e.g. a guardian with visual impairment) can access content to support their students' learning All families will have the opportunity to attend a Parent Camp before the year begins, which will focus solely on training families and giving them the knowledge they need to access the different platforms and content for virtual learning. Schools' teams will have monthly community meetings to provide continuous development for families, as needed, to families based upon feedback we receive. Families will complete a weekly Care Corps survey, where they will be able to identify any areas of support they need, including support around accessing content. The manner in which LEA deliver related services for students in distance learning Rocketship will continue to provide virtual related services to the greatest extent possible. Service providers will craft schedules based on the designated blocks in the bell schedule. As part of collaboration with teams, ISE & Related Service providers for each campus will hold a monthly collaborative meeting to review student needs, service implementation and upcoming IEPs. The manner in which the LEA will support parent training for students receiving related services through distance learning During orientation, virtual parent home visits and initial related service sessions, Related Service Providers will meet with parents and students to help them in determining the supplementary tools that the family needs in order to implement services in their home as well as any additional technology. RSP's will provide parents and students with guidelines and training on how parents can support their students during services as well as resources that the parents can use if they are unable to support their child during service delivery. The manner in which LEAs will deliver recovery services to students with disabilities during the 2020-21 school year and how LEAs will communicate those services to families Rocketship Public Schools will use the form in Attachment 4 to determine what services and the amount of services a student will receive for recovery services. Upon completion of progress monitoring and data collection (the first 6 weeks of school), Rocketship will facilitate Regression and Recoupment meetings for each student with an IEP that will include the entire IEP team. The steps LEAs will take to ensure that students with disabilities are assessed upon return to school to determine the nature and severity of the impact of learning loss on their receipt of educational benefit Students with disabilities will continue to take assessments like STEP and other core content assessments to identify student strengths and areas of need. Students with disabilities will also have their skills tracked with Amira and Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 56 Freckle throughout the 20.21 school year. Case managers will keep data records of all core skills for students from Amira and Freckle to measure both regression from before distance learning and time to recoup skills during the fall.

Whether families are in need of food, shelter, technology or other resources, it is the CareCorps responsibility to connect families with internal and external resources. The CareCorps is a school level team of individuals willing to do whatever it takes to connect with our most vulnerable families on a daily basis. Every Rocketship school has designated a CareCorps of at least four educators who are responsible for contacting every Rocketship family, at least twice per week. In the morning, the CareCorps sends a brief wellness survey to all families to ensure everyone feels safe at home and identify any needs in the school community. The team reviews all responses before 12pm and then follows up with direct outreach to families who indicated they need support. The CareCorps then connects families with the services and resources they need, including technology help, food assistance, or housing help. PURPOSE or POLICY STATEMENT: This submission is a narrative to demonstrate how Rocketship DC will meet the educational and social-emotional needs of English learners. DESCRIPTION:14.Describe the LEA's plan to serve ELs, including: A description of the EL program model and how it will maintain fidelity across in-person, distance learning and hybrid learning environments; The manner in which the LEA will set language goals across the four language domains of reading, writing, listening, and speaking to advance your EL students' English proficiency; The manner in which the LEA will provide language instruction in reading, writing, listening, and speaking to EL students during distance learning/hybrid learning environments by grade and by proficiency level; and The manner in which the LEA will provide EL students access to academic content by grade and proficiency level. Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 57 Technology PolicyRocketship will continue to follow OSSE's EL assessment timelines to to the greatest extent possible. The manner in which the LEA will provide language instruction in reading, writing, listening, and speaking to EL students during distance learning/hybrid learning environments by grade and by proficiency level At the beginning of the school year our focus is getting to know our EL students and their needs. Students goals will be made and entered into Elevation, our tracking program for EL students, within the first month of school. Teachers at Infinity Community Prep will be training in Guided Language Acquisition and Design (GLAD). This evidence-based training trains them on how to incorporate EL skills into instruction for all students. Small group language development will also be prioritized within the Humanities block. Integrated EL instruction will take place using various strategies, which apply at each level of proficiency, that can be integrated into daily distance learning activities, synchronous and asynchronous lessons. Examples of these strategies include use of input charts in videos and online lessons and language use opportunities (Turn and Talks, Say it With me/Read it with me, Total Physical Response, Cite your source). Transitional and waived students (students who are classified as EL but are near graduating from that status) will continuously be monitored for progress and placed into services if progress and goals are not being met. Language instruction will be provided in each domain through both Integrated and Designated English Language Development. During integrated ELD, students will focus on the speaking and listening domains to support strong habits of discussion. In K-2, students will have the opportunity to express their ideas through speaking and writing in thematic unit, phonics, and guided reading. In G3-G5, students will have the opportunity to express their ideas through speaking and writing in thematic unit, close reading, and guided reading. All grade levels will engage in a daily language block that will focus on the language strand of the CCSS. Students will apply these standards and skills to authentic speaking and writing contexts. Curriculum and student tasks are developed through a UDL lens. Students will have options for expressing their ideas by either verbally responding or through writing. Instruction will be differentiated by the amounts of support that students need to have equitable access to content. The manner in which the LEA will provide EL students access to academic content by grade and proficiency level Equitable access to content is a core belief of our English learner program. Within the Sheltered Instruction program model, students will be learning new content and language simultaneously. To achieve this teachers will use a variety of GLAD, SIOP, SDAIE strategies to plan their lessons and engage students in learning. This process includes proactively planning the types of processing and engagement opportunities for students. Strategies will also be employed to respond to the language and skills that students during instruction, so that teachers can provide support on the task and build independence. Goal setting and reflecting on progress towards goals will help students stay on track to meet their goals and assist teachers in intentionally supporting each goal. Teachers will adjust the type and intensity of their support, based on a students proficiency level. Teachers will use comprehensible input to help students understand new information and engagement strategies to maximize production of language. 15.Describe the LEA's policy for technology use during distance learning, including: Expectations for student access to devices and technical training; The manner in which the LEA will assess student/family technology needs; The supports that will be provided to students who do not have access to internet or devices due to circumstances beyond their control; The plan for replacing/repairing devices; Expectations for student access to internet and safeguarding personally identifiable information (PII); What limitations, if any, you are putting on LEA device use at home (e.g., prohibiting social media, video games, etc.) and how you are enforcing them; and Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 58 PURPOSE or POLICY STATEMENT: Rocketship DC is committed to the effective use of technology to both enhance the quality of student learning and the efficiency of school operations. Pre-COVID-19, students' use of the school owned and operated technology resources happened during class time, on campus. During and post-COVID-19, student use of, and access to, school-owned-and-operated technology is a necessary part of the learning process for all students. Rocketship DC is committed to equitable access to technology resources necessary for learning for all students and will enter the 2020-21 school year with enough chromebooks for every student, who needs one. Students (and where applicable, their families) must sign and submit a form to commit to keeping their Rocketship technology safe and in working condition during their time with it. Beyond defining Rocketship DC's general policy on providing equitable access to technology and ensuring its safe use, this policy provides a series of steps to ensure a Return to School Technology Plan is in place. It will include training and support for teachers to adapt virtual learning skills for the classroom. Additionally, it will provide training in data and cyber security to assist staff in understanding the risks and responsibilities associated with the new learning environment. DESCRIPTION: The following plan for the effective use and oversight of school technology during and after the COVID-19 Pandemic draws on a framework developed by the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction. This framework comprises three steps: Review (where things stood at the close of 2019-20); 1. Plan (what must be accomplished before the 2020-21 school year begins; and2. Implement (during SY 2020-21). 3. The intended result of following this process is to develop a Return to School Technology Plan that is based on and aligned to the existing School Technology Plan . If a school has not previously drafted a School Technology Plan, there is no time like the present to begin. Equipment, Software, and Training Expectation and Supports for Students and Staff Per DC PCSB requirement, Rocketship DC will provide all students and staff with the necessary technology equipment, software, and training to fully participate in remote learning as indicated in the tables below. Equipment All students and staff will receive the following equipment Chromebook will be provided to all students enrolled at Rocketship Protective Chromebook carrying case, by request Hot Spot, as needed prioritizing homeless, sheltered or families that are mobile iPads, as needed for Special Education students Software All students and staff will have access to the following software using school-created and maintained log-in and passwords. At no time will anyone outside of the school's community be able to access the software. Clever See Saw Google Classroom ZoomIf/how the school's technology policy differs by grade level. Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 59 Online Learning Programs, including: Lexia ST Math Freckle Lightsail Typing Agent Training For every piece of equipment and software, provide training for staff, students, and families (especially for younger children) on proper use and care. Training must also include a way to access technical support for malfunctioning equipment and to use the equipment and software properly. Review & Assessment: Equipment We will review the inventory of what equipment that was previously assigned to returning students and staff and ensure that they are in working order. For new families and staff joining the school community, we will survey their needs. We will keep extra equipment on site for students and staff to borrow for each expected type of equipment for use. Rocketship DC is running physically distanced Chromebook collection and distribution days in early August to collect all of the Chromebooks that are currently in homes, and replace them with an updated Chromebook for use in the new school year. Any Chromebooks that are returned that are needing repair will be sent to our vendor JetCity for remedy. These will become our replacement devices throughout the year. Internet availability and speed, and number of household members expected to be using the Internet during the school day The numbers, types, and conditions of devices used in their homes to support virtual learning, including, but not limited to: computer, smartphone, chromebook, and tablet Security features on the technology (for younger children, especially) Rocketeers must use their Rocketship log-in to access Chromebooks. Teachers have this information in the case a family forgets. Rocketship DC school-based operations teams own troubleshooting family technology issues at home. Rocketship gets information on technology issues via a daily survey families receive. With fast communication between the family and Rocketship we can solve almost all problems within a school week. Software Based on the instructional plan, determine what software best supports remote learning. We will complete a software inventory to determine what software was purchased or is in a trial period. We will inventory school technology staff strengths and needs. Inventory communication resources and protocols and evaluate performance and needs. Some of our base software include: Google Apps Zoom Classroom management Microsoft Training We will survey families and staff on their training needs for equipment use and software use and build a schedule based on need. All training will be provided remotely. If family or staff need help setting up equipment, Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 60 accommodations will be made to offer on-site training, following CDC social distancing guidance and ideally complete this via Facetime or another video app on a family's phone (if possible). Support Provided for Students without Access to Internet or Devices Based on the needs assessment, students without internet access and/or devices will be provided access via a mobile hotspot and an age-appropriate device. Where possible, students will be expected to retrieve hotspots and devices at the school, where they will also receive training and expectations for proper use and care of equipment. For students and families not able to retrieve equipment from the school, arrangements will be made for shipping the equipment directly to the student. Training, expectations and care of equipment will be provided virtually in such cases. Replacing/Repairing Equipment Equipment Rocketship DC will have loaner equipment available for families and staff on an as-needed basis. How will families return broken equipment? On-site visits will be scheduled How will families check out \"loaner\" equipment? On site visits will be scheduled and equipment will be tracked in our chromebook distribution tracking system. What is the accountability if equipment fails due to misuse? This will be addressed on a case by case basis. It is important to us that all students have access to a device to engage in learning, even if the equipment failed due to misuse. That will be a signal to us to spend more time with the student and family(remotely) in ensuring they take care of Rocketship's devices. We purposefully purchase durable equipment for our young students, but there is always this possibility. How will you identify if there is an equipment malfunction (versus software or training)? As families report issues (via the daily survey) our Operations staff gives the family a phone call to troubleshoot. The team has been doing this work since March 2019 and is able to assess Chromebooks remotely. In the case that solving the problem remotely is not possible we will ask the family to drop off the device at the campus during a scheduled time, adhering to CDC guidelines for physically distancing. Software How will software malfunctions be determined and addressed? If the school-based Operations team can not support the family in troubleshooting we can leverage the Personalized Learning team and Information and Technology Systems team and the vendors of our online learning platforms to solve software issues. How will student passwords be safeguarded? Student passwords will be safeguarded by our Personalized Learning team. Passwords can be shared with families, if they forget. What is the process for getting access if \"locked out\" of software? Families will reach out to Rocketship either through the daily survey, their teacher or via email. We will partner with the parent on next steps to unlock their computer. In some cases we can provide the information to do this over the phone, remote into the computer and solve, or in other cases we may need to have them drop the computer off on campus for us to support. Training What training will be provided throughout the year to families with repeat or severe issues with equipment or software? Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 61 For these issues, which we did not have many of in Spring 2020, we will partner with teachers and parents to monitor the technology closely. In addition, School Leadership will meet with the family via ZOOM to have a conversation about what happened previously and what safeguards the family can/should put in place to better protect the equipment. If a family is not engaged in this process, the Principal will be looped in for support. Who will be responsible for troubleshooting electronic issues at the school (vendor or school staff)? School-based operations team DC based Technology team member Jumpstart (vendor for tech support) JetCity (vendor for fixing Chromebooks) Expectations for student access to internet and safeguarding personally identifiable information (PII) Devices issued to students by the school will have pre-installed software that prevents students from accessing prohibited sites and allows school personnel to remotely login to the device, update its software or disable the device entirely. Equipment Each student assigned Chromebook is equipped with software that tracks and monitors logins and PC access; No student will be allowed to log into a PC or information without the needed credentials provided by Rocketship Education No student connected Chromebooks connection ties back to Rocketships enterprise servers for communication. Eliminating the ability to pull student level directory information or PII information Software Each Rocketship PC is equipped with securly software to address content filtering and monitor internet traffic relating to student and staff access Google safeguards are in place to protect student information while students are logged into Google Classroom Remote Learning Limitations on School-Provided Devices Equipment If a piece of equipment (charger, etc) breaks or goes missing Rocketship will work with the family to send a replacement. If a family becomes a repeat offender of missing items School Leadership will need to have a ZOOM conversation with the guardian and student. Hardware can be used by other family members, as long as everyone treats the device with care and as long as the Rocketeers can submit their work on time and are able to attend their live classes. Software Rocketeers must use their Clever log in credentials to access the computer. Families will not be able to download their own programs or software to the computer, as they are not an administrator. Rocketship can perform remote pushes of information to Chromebooks and the Chromebooks are set to automatically update when there is one available. Limitations regarding internet use is set by IT policies throughout our Rocketship Education. All student systems have been added to remote management systems to monitor and enforce policies. Training During Summer PD teachers will be trained on our online learning platforms, and our live lesson communication tools (ZOOM!, Facebook Live) and how to record and post videos (Google Classroom, Facebook) Office of the State Superintendent of Education 1050 First Street, NE, Sixth Floor Washington, DC 20002 62 Family Engagement PolicyStaff has access to a technology ticketing system that will get them a response quickly to their technology needs. This ticketing system can be found on our main staff webpage (internal). During the first week of school Rocketeers will focus on properly using technology at their desks (if virtual, at home). Families fill out a daily survey where (amongst other things) they can alert us to any technology issues. From there a staff member will call them and work on troubleshooting that day. Families can share technology issues with their student's teachers or a School Leader who can connect them with a DC-based technology problem solver (either a school-based operations team member or our Regional IT Support Specialist.

FAMILY ENGAGEMENT IN CONTINUOUS LEARNING Rocketship DC has crafted an Instructional Delivery Plan in order to provide equitable access to learning for students as we navigate returning to school during a global pandemic, COVID-19. The intention is to continually engage families in the improvement of our remote and on-site learning opportunities so that the school is providing each student what they need in order to navigate this new way of learning. We will engage families in this process by providing training, opportunities to provide feedback on an ongoing basis, and resources on how to support their learner at home and when they are learning in-person at school. Additionally, relationships with our families are core to our mission at Rocketship Public Schools, In the midst of COVID-19, we will continue to prioritize building authentic relationships with our families at the beginning of the year, knowing that it is more important now than ever to build strong partnerships with each of them. At the beginning of the year, Rocketship will do the following: Ensure 100% of families receive a virtual home visit by October 1st Hold a weekly family town hall at each school, starting in August up to the start of school, for families Dedicate Community Meeting / SEL t ime at the beginning of the year to building relationships between classmates Have technology and materials pick ups where families can meet teachers and staff members in a safe and socially distant way Survey parents during the first month of school to gain a better understanding of the challenges their students might have experienced since March to identify trends and supports Survey each individual student to identify the number of trusted adults and friends they have on campus; this information will be used to create targeted SEL interventions and groups Send a weekly CareCorps survey to families to provide supports and resources to our most vulnerable families We will continue to use the data we get from the aforementioned strategies to modify our engagement plans throughout the year to ensure we continue to prioritize relationships with all stakeholders. Trainings During the summer, and at regular intervals across the year, Rocketship DC will provide virtual and in- person (as we are able to) training to support families in navigating the continuous learning plan of Rocketship DC.
