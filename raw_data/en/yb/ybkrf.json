And they name names, documenting their involvement in such issues as acid rain, the dangers of smoking and secondhand smoke, the ozone hole, global warming, the Strategic Defense Initiative, and the banning of DDT. These scientists aimed to sow seeds of public doubt on matters of settled science by casting aspersions on the science and the scientists who produce it.

About this week's feature article In this week's eSkeptic, Richard Morrock discusses psychoanalyst Wilhelm Reich's development of pseudoscientific psychotherapy, sensational claims and extreme theories. This article appeared in [Skeptic magazine, volume 2, number 3](https://www.skeptic.com/magazine/archives/vol02n03.html) (1994). This is a follow-up article to [Epigones of Orgonomy](https://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/10-12-15/#feature), which appeared two weeks ago in eSkeptic. Richard Morrock is a writer based in New York. He has been active with the skeptics movement, and has lectured on a variety of subjects to skeptical groups in New York and Philadelphia. He is also involved with the International Psychohistorical Association, of which he has served as vice president and newsletter editor. He has written a book called [The Psychology of Genocide and Violent Oppression: A Study of Mass Cruelty from Nazi Germany to Rwanda](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0786447761?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0786447761) Pseudo-Psychotherapy: UFOs, Cloudbusters, Conspiracies, and Paranoia in Wilhelm Reich's Pyschotherapy by Richard Morrock The ideas of maverick psychoanalyst Wilhelm Reich tend to be found on the furthest shores of American intellectual life, where conspiracy theories abound, UFOs haunt the skies, and the radical left begins to overlap with the ultra-right. Overshadowed even in the 1960s by his rival, Herbert Marcuse, Reich remained a hero and martyr to a small but fragmented group of followers, and a major influence on the thinking of a much larger group of political and sexual non-conformists who might not describe themselves as Reichians. Wilhelm Reich was born and raised in the remote eastern hinterlands of the Austrian Empire around the turn of the century. After relocating to Vienna following World War I, he became involved with the burgeoning psychoanalytic movement of Sigmund Freud, and soon came to be regarded as its most productive disciple. At the same time, Reich was involved in Marxist politics; he was a member of the Austrian Communist Party, and was later briefly a member of the German Communist Party. \"If sexual repression is essential for the survival of oppressive class society, and if the oppressive class society imposes sexual repression, then where does one begin to eliminate oppression?\" Reich was hardly alone in combining a psychoanalytic profession with a proletarian revolutionary avocation, although he had a peculiar penchant for quarreling with others, such as Marcuse and Otto Fenichel, who shared these two orientations. Reich, however, combined the political and the personal in a way which distinguished him from even his most radical psychoanalytic colleagues. He argued that sexual repression was the basis of class oppression, and that only the liberation of the individual from his Oedipal complex could prepare the way for the emergence of social justice after the coming revolution. This theory laid down a challenge to both the communist and psycho-analytic establishments. From the former, Reich demanded a commitment to sexual revolution which, following a short period of experimentation in the wake of the Bolshevik revolution, the followers of Lenin were unwilling to make. From the latter, Reich demanded support for both sexual and social revolution; but no psychoanalysts were prepared to call for the elimination of all sexual repression, and most were far too comfortable in their professional lifestyles to mount the barricades on behalf of the international working class. Consequently, by 1935, Reich had been expelled from the ranks of both the communist movement and the International Psychoanalytic Association. Although his followers are oblivious to it, there is a contradiction in Reich's prescription for society. If, as Reich argues, sexual repression is essential for the survival of oppressive class society, and if, as he also argues, the oppressive class society imposes sexual repression, then where does one begin to eliminate oppression? It cannot be done through psychotherapy, because the ruling class would not permit it; nor can it be done through revolution, because sexually repressed workers would not be able to create a truly free society \u2014 one need only look at Russia. Given Reich's assumptions, meaningful social progress is all but impossible. It should not be surprising, then, that his most vocal group of adherents, the American College of Orgonomy, has now turned away from the original left-wing ideas of its founder, and endorses a hard-line variety of ultra-conservatism. Reich himself, late in his life, idolized Eisenhower and supported the Korean War, but even he would have hesitated to call for more authoritarianism in the public schools, or hint that the downfall of communism in Eastern Europe was really a communist plot. The rise of Nazism in Germany and Austria compelled Reich to emigrate to the United States, following a short stay in Scandinavia, where, even in relatively liberal Norway, his radical sexual views got him into trouble with the authorities. Arriving in New York City, Reich established himself in middle-class Forest Hills and founded a school of psychoanalytic thought which he later broadened to include opinions on everything from sex education to the origins of the universe. Following his death, his adherents split into rival factions. There are now three \"orthodox\" Reichian organizations which fight one another tooth and nail, while at the same time heaping scorn on the \"neo-Reichians\" such as Alexander Lowen, founder of bioenergetics. To his credit, Reich was the first theorist to bring the human body into psychotherapy, continuing a process which was begun, somewhat hesitantly, by Freud. Reich argued that repressed emotions were buried in what he described as the muscular armor. Sometimes he would illustrate what he termed the \"segments\" of the body \u2014 head, chest, pelvis, etc. \u2014 in charts which looked remarkably like those used by Hindu doctors to portray the chakras, or energy centers. Essential to Reichian therapy is the release of buried emotions through physical manipulation of the patient's body, which is coupled with psychotherapy of a more-or-less Freudian orientation. Sometimes this had dramatic results, but they were not always positive. In cases where the patient is not prepared to accept the feelings that are released, the effects are similar to a \"bad trip\" on LSD. After his experience, the patient starts to believe in some pretty strange things. Paradoxically, bad results in Reichian therapy lend support to his theories, much as alchemists' turning gold into lead, however unprofitable, would at least prove that they were indeed able to transmute metals. Anna Freud, who knew Reich well during his Vienna days, considered him psychotic. One can take this judgement with a grain of salt, needless to say, remembering that Reich's advocacy of sexual liberation might not have sat too well with the celibate Ms. Freud. But by the last years of his life, Reich was showing signs of paranoia which even his most devoted followers were hard pressed to deny. Two of his later books, [Listen, Little Man](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0374504016?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0374504016) and [The Murder of Christ](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0374504768?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0374504768), read like bizarre sermons, as Reich expounds on the perversity of narrow-minded fools who fail to recognize him as the secular messiah. These two works make Reich sound like the quintessential mad scientist. But neither book compares with his last, [Contact With Space](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007EVSU0?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0007EVSU0). While Reichians accuse the United States government of totalitarian tactics because the Food and Drug Administration, in an excess of bureaucratic zeal, burned Reich's books when they closed down his laboratory, the Reichians themselves have kept Contact With Space out of print, to ensure that the public remains unfamiliar with Reich's curious notions about hostile flying saucers. Unlike groups familiar to skeptics, such as MUFON and CUFOS, Reich did not merely maintain that the earth was being visited by space aliens. He went so far as to claim that the UFOs were hostile, piloted by beings he termed \"CORE people\" who were coming to steal our planet's orgone energy. He even wondered if his own father was one of these \"CORE people,\" which would make Reich the product of interplanetary miscegenation. From the hesitant way in which he expressed this opinion, it seems that his psychoanalytic training was alerting him to the possibility that this notion was delusionary. His followers have not always had such doubts. A graduate of Reichian therapy, Jerome Eden (now deceased), founded a group called the Professional Planetary Citizens Council, whose pretentious title disguised the fact that it never had more than eight or ten members. Eden not only pushed the theory that the earth was under attack by hostile flying saucers, he even claimed to have translated a \"Cosmic Combat\" manual, purportedly found at a UFO landing site along with a convenient bilingual dictionary, giving the aliens' plans for subjugating earth through stealth and deception. \"Should anyone detect our intent,\" the supposed space creatures slyly declare, \"the best defense is to publicly brand such outcry as preposterous and to brand such a person as obviously insane.\" The author of the document quotes the great Prussian military theorist Clausewitz, raising some suspicions in my mind that he/she/it may have been from our own planet; though I suppose one should hesitate to jump to such conclusions! Reichians have reported engaging UFOs in battle, using their \"cloudbusters\" \u2014 weather control devices of unproven value. In February, 1955, a group of Reichian scientists claimed to have fought off invading UFOs outside Tucson, Arizona, suffering one casualty as a heroic defender was injured by a blast of radiation. The invaders never returned. Reich himself once claimed to have driven off a UFO with his own cloudbuster near his laboratory in Rangeley, Maine. Reichians have not been emphasizing the UFO threat in recent years. However, Peter Robins of New York City has spoken at gatherings of the American College of Orgonomy about space visitors, and seems to aspire to Eden's title as leading Reichian authority on UFOs. One controversial issue on which Reichians have a great deal to say is weather control. Reichians, with their \"cloudbusters\" based on \"orgone energy,\" claim credit each time a drought ends in the West, although rival Reichian groups often fight with each other over whose experiments actually caused it to rain. The unproven claim of weather control tends to alienate some people who might otherwise be attracted to Reichian ideas; saving the world is one thing, playing god is another. Reichian die-hards, nonetheless, expect that their rain-making experiments will compel doubters to accept their entire cosmology. \"Reichians with their 'cloudbusters' claim credit each time a drought ends in the West, although rival Reichian groups often fight with each other over whose experiments actually caused it to rain.\" Another theory adhered to by Reichians is spontaneous generation. Reich argued that living forms could arise from inorganic matter in sealed, sterilized test tubes containing ordinary backyard debris boiled in water. If this were true, it would invalidate all biological research over the past few centuries. Reich was contemptuous of critics who argued that the appearance of amoebas and other micro-organisms in his test tubes were due to his inadequate controls, which allowed spores to survive in the medium. His followers argue that conventional scientists are unable to appreciate Reich's discoveries because they are \"armored\" by their neuroses \u2014 sort of a modern-day equivalent of the Emperor's New Clothes. They say that if other scientists underwent orgonomic therapy, they would see the same phenomena which the Reichians report from their own labs. This might well be true, if one were to assume that Reichian therapy is so harmful that it consistently causes people to see things that are not there. Reich ended his life in prison, dying of a heart attack just before he was scheduled to be released. The original charge against him was selling \"orgone accumulators\" across state lines, which got him into trouble with the FDA. However, he could have easily beaten this charge if he had wanted to. Reich refused to contest the charge in court on the basis that his \"scientific\" doctrines could not be argued in a court of law. He was convicted not of fraud or quackery, but of contempt of court. Reich's followers hold that their leader was framed as part of a communist plot and that the U.S. government, at the height of the Cold War and after years of McCarthyite hysteria, was acting as Moscow's instrument when it prosecuted Reich. Ironically, Reich's original aim was to purge Freud's doctrine of its metaphysical baggage and put it on a sound scientific basis. But as his school of thought developed, it began to include more and more long-discarded theories and folk tales, dressed up in pseudoscientific terminology and confirmed by dubious experiments which non-Reichians have not been able to replicate. Spontaneous generation is revived in Reich's descriptions of \"T-bacilli.\" Animal magnetism becomes orgone energy and the Yin and Yang of Mahayana Buddhism are reworked into Reich's theory of cosmic superimposition. What Reich never broke with in psychoanalysis was the notion of reductionism, which sees social events as nothing more than the reflection of psychological reality. Reich, in fact, carried this even further by attempting to reduce psychology to biology and physics, the latter being, as Martin Gardner pointed out, a subject about which Reich had far too little knowledge. Coupled with his own authoritarianism and his apparent inability to distinguish objective from subjective phenomena, Reich's reductionism led him to develop a pseudoscientific psychotherapy which exceeds all others both in its scope and in the dogmatism and intolerance of its adherents.

Christopher Dell joins the MonsterTalk crew to discuss why humans are so fascinated by these bizarre entities. About this week's feature article On November 4, 2005, the first ever Evolution-Intelligent Design trial of the 21st century drew to a close in Federal court in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania: Kitzmiller et al v. Dover Area School District. On December 20th, 2005, a judgement was made against the teaching of Intelligent Design. (We [reported on that important decision in eSkeptic](https://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/05-12-20/#feature) that day.) In this week's eSkeptic, two days after the fifth anniversary of that judgment, Andrew Williams discusses some of the details from the trial as well as the current state of affairs in the ongoing creationism-evolution debate. Andrew Zak Williams is a barrister based in England. He is also a columnist at [www.secularnewsdaily.com](http://www.secularnewsdaily.com/) and has articles published in the January 2011 editions of The Humanist and American Atheist. The Trial of the (New) Century Dover and the 5th Anniversary of Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District by Andrew Zak Williams This year, 20th December marked the fifth anniversary of the judgment in the first major, no holds barred courtroom battle between Evolution and the new species of creationism known as Intelligent Design (ID). The question before the court was whether Intelligent Design was a credible scientific theory. If so, the school board of a small town in Pennsylvania would be able to argue that it had acted lawfully when it amended its science curriculum to include the reading to students of a description of ID, along with recommended readings promoting this new form of creationism. If ID was just a religious belief, however, discussing it in a science classroom would be a violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, which aims to provide separation of church and state. ID's \"big tent\" had already become a public relations triumph, attracting the support of bible-thumping Christians, a sprinkling of academics, and millions in between. In fact, during the weeks before the case came to court, President George W. Bush had stated his belief that students should be taught both sides of the controversy, and the Pope was reported to be reconsidering the Vatican's acceptance of evolution. Meanwhile ID was being featured prominently in the likes of such venues as the New York Times, the American Spectator, and on late night TV debates. The trial would be called Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District. And like a boxing promoter anticipating the big fight, leading ID proponent William Dembski wrote on his website in May 2005: I therefore await the day when the hearings ... involve subpoenas that compel evolutionists to be deposed and interrogated at length on their views ... What I propose, then, is a strategy for interrogating the Darwinists to, as it were, squeeze the truth out of them. The article, which is still available on the ID-supporting Uncommon Descent website, is accompanied by a picture of a Darwin doll with its head in a vise. This kind of aggression from parts of the Christian community is explicable. For them, Kitzmiller was concerned with more than a science curriculum. It was a battle between worldviews: theism and godless materialism. As Daniel Dennett previously noted, \"The theory of evolution diminishes the best reason anyone has ever suggested for believing in a divine creator.\" There could be no doubt: if the claim brought by Ms. Kitzmiller and her fellow disaffected parents were to fail, other school boards would soon follow Dover's lead and introduce ID into their science classes nationwide. Is ID Science? Evolution refers to the idea that (1) species change through time and that (2) they are all descended from one or more common ancestors. It was Darwin who explained that (3) the engine that drives evolution is natural selection. At trial, the Dover board called biologist Michael Behe, a leading ID scientist, as its star witness. After all, it is his theory of Irreducible Complexity that underpins much of the ID movement. His evidence made clear that ID proponents don't necessarily reject the first two prongs of evolution. But they deny the third one. According to IDers, natural selection is incapable of driving evolution on the scale required to account for the diversity of life on the planet. Cue the Intelligent Designer. Leaving aside its religious implications, is ID even scientific? The plaintiffs' expert witness, biologist and believer Kenneth Miller, said no. Science is the systematic attempt to \"provide natural explanations for natural phenomena.\" Crucially, ID cannot be science because it relies upon a supernatural being. Behe and microbiologist Scott Minnich argued for a different definition of science that allows for the introduction of the supernatural. For them, ID is science \"because it relies completely on the physical, observable, empirical facts about nature plus logical inferences.\" According to Behe, the sub-cellular world appears to be designed, and so it is scientific to conclude that it must have been designed unless there is a compelling reason to believe otherwise. Unfortunately for him, Behe was forced to admit that his definition was so loose that it embraced even astrology. But there was another reason why the school board was always going to be on the back foot when it came to proving that ID was science. It had been the fall-out from the Dover school board's decision to promote the ID textbook, [Of Pandas and People](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0685459039?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0685459039), which had led to its decision to amend the science curriculum. The plaintiffs called philosopher Barbara Forrest to describe the history of the book under its various titles. The first two editions and the first draft of the third edition had explicitly taught creationism. But the second draft of the third edition eradicated the language of creationism and replaced it with ID-speak. What had happened between the two drafts to bring about this change? Forrest explained that the supervening event was the 1987 case Edwards v. Aguillard. In that case the Supreme Court held that teaching creation science violated the Establishment Clause because it involved teaching a religious belief rather than science. Although all subsequent editions used revised labels, such as replacing the word \"creation\" with \"design,\" at heart this was still a creationist text. Humorously, in the cut-and-paste process they failed to select the whole word before pasting in the new term \"design proponent,\" resulting in the hybrid \"cdesign proponentists.\" Irreducible Complexity What is Behe's theory upon which the scientific credibility of ID rests? Behe claims that if you analyze the blood-clotting system, the immune system and the bacterial flagellum, you'll see that they are \"irreducibly complex\". To explain what this means, he says that if these had evolved by natural selection, there must have been many intermediate forms between their simple earliest states and their present highly complex ones. But Behe claimed that this couldn't have happened through a step-wise gradual system such as natural selection because each of the intermediate forms would have been useless and thus eliminated by natural selection. When Behe first published his theory it was not subjected to the process of peer review that scientific journals demand. Instead, he laid out his thoughts in the 1996 book Darwin's Black Box, which sold largely to a religious audience desperate to embrace his conclusions. What's more, rather than providing compelling evidence, Behe set out the reasons for his theory and left it to others to disprove it. Even though it is exceptionally difficult to prove the evolutionary history of these types of biological systems, evolutionists rose to the challenge. In the case of the flagellum, evolutionary biologists have relied on a concept known as exaptation, or an ex-adaptation. This refers to the evolution of a system that evolved for one function but later evolved into a different use. In his courtroom testimony, Kenneth Miller explained that some bacteria possess a kind of syringe known as a Type III Secretory System (\"TTSS\"). The TTSS shares many protein parts with the flagellum but has fewer of them. And so the TTSS could have been naturally selected for its effectiveness at secreting things from inside to outside the cell before evolving into what eventually became a device for propulsion called the flagellum. Crucially, this demonstrated that if you remove some of the components of the flagellum, the result could be a working organic system, which is a fatal blow to the theory of irreducible complexity. The blood-clotting system fared no better under the withering cross-examination by the plaintiffs' attorneys. Behe's book had based much of its blood-clotting discussion on work carried out by Richard Doolittle. It was therefore an especial blow to Behe that in 2003 Doolittle himself published a paper that demonstrated that pufferfish lack at least three of the 26 factors found in the blood-clotting system, but crucially they possess what is still a workable blood-clotting system. This put to the lie Behe's claim that the system is irreducibly complex. What's more, there's no need to rely on the exaptation argument above. As for the immune system, Behe stated, \"The scientific literature has no detailed, testable answers to the question of how the immune system could have arisen by random mutation and natural selection.\" In one of the few visually dramatic points of the trial, the plaintiffs' lawyer piled a tower of over seventy articles and books on the witness stand that he confidently proclaimed provided that very explanation. Peering from behind the stack, Behe admitted that he hadn't read it all but nonetheless insisted that it just wasn't \"good enough.\" 20th December 2005 and Beyond At 10.30 on a crisp morning on Tuesday, 20th December 2005, Judge John Jones III handed down his judgment: all 139 pages of it. He was a religious man who was appointed to the job by George W. Bush. Even so, his ruling was a damning indictment of ID. Judge Jones explained that he couldn't avoid \"the inescapable conclusion that ID is an interesting theological argument, but that it is not science. ... The overwhelming evidence at trial established that ID is a religious view, a mere re-labeling of creationism, and not a scientific theory.\" Jones also noted that ID's central argument of irreducible complexity was nothing new. After all, it employed the same flawed and illogical contrivances that doomed creation science in the 1980s. And ID's failure to produce peer-reviewed publications was the final nail in the coffin of any scientific pretensions. In all, Jones concluded, it was \"abundantly clear that the Board's ID Policy violates the Establishment Clause,\" as does teaching ID in science class generally. The ruling has the force of law in only one of Pennsylvania's three federal judicial districts. But Judge Jones' decision serves as a warning to any school district thinking of instituting a policy similar to Dover. Only last November, 2010, Education Week reported that in several U.S. states school officials still feel emboldened by the ruling. The result has been a range of new curriculum materials, more teacher training, and pro-evolution activism by teachers. The Dover ruling clearly polarized opinion. For some it was the latest step in a Darwinian conspiracy to eradicate religion, and with it moral certainty. But only a year before the trial, ID theorist and Discovery fellow Paul Nelson admitted: Easily the biggest challenge facing the ID community is to develop a full-fledged theory of biological design. ... Right now, we've got a bag of powerful intuitions and a handful of notions such as irreducible complexity and specified complexity, but as yet, no general theory of biological design. And in 2006, Phillip Johnson, the figurehead of ID, gave an interview to Berkeley Science Review in which he conceded: \"No [ID] product is ready for competition in the educational world.\" In the light of these admissions, the kind of vitriol to which Judge Jones has been subjected is a stain on the fading honor of the ID movement. Of course, the fact that ID isn't science doesn't necessarily mean that it's wrong. Jones' judgment was a little surprising in this respect. He justified his decision that ID isn't science, in part, by referring to the fact that it had failed to be accepted by the scientific community and that it had been refuted by scientists. But curiously, he didn't go one step further and rely on those facts to conclude that the theory wasn't true. On the contrary, for legal reasons having to do with the restriction of the court to narrowly rule on the matter at hand, he expressly stated that the court was taking no position on that question. Teach the Controversy The Discovery Institute, ID's flashing beacon, is clear in its stance: its theory exists and so it's only fair for schoolchildren to be taught both sides of the argument. And if ID can't be taught, children should at least be taught the controversy. The fact that ID is religious and unscientific doesn't come into it: nor does the fact that in scientific terms there's no controversy to teach. The ID movement may have been born out of a desire to replace moral relativism with religious absolutes. But conversely, when it comes to education, it seeks to remove scientific absolutes and to replace them with a relativist approach in which proven science is taught alongside any theory which garners enough publicity to demand to be heard. Frustratingly for the scientific community, most of the American public agrees with the \"Teach the Controversy\" slogan. With its implied appeal to fair play, it's an inspired piece of marketing. But Judge Jones wasn't impressed. To him, the motto \"is at best disingenuous, and at worst a canard. The goal of the ID [movement] is not to encourage critical thought, but to foment a revolution which would supplant evolutionary theory with ID.\" In the realms of ID science, the movement marches on almost as though Kitzmiller didn't happen, with the likes of Michael Behe, Stephen C. Meyer, William Dembski, and Steve Fuller penning recent books which have attracted media attention. And in 2008 an independent film entitled Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed was released, in which it was alleged that mainstream science suppresses academics who support ID. ( [Read Expelled Exposed on skeptic.com](https://www.skeptic.com/reading_room/expelled-exposed/)) The film has been used in private screenings for legislators as part of the Discovery Institute's campaign to introduce Academic Freedom bills into state legislatures. Discovery's website even provides a boilerplate for those looking to draft this kind of legislation. In the main, the bills have been defeated, although Governor Bobby Jindal signed one into law in Louisiana in 2008. Nevertheless, Kitzmiller came as a well-deserved boon to pro-evolution teachers and scientists. Five years on, however, it is clear that in the battle between different worldviews, there's no truce in sight as creationism continues to evolve.

[Andrew at the JREF Most skeptics are familiar with the James Randi Educational Foundation \u2014 a not-for-profit organization founded in 1996 that offers [a $1,000,000 prize](http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/1m-challenge.html) for testable proof of paranormal ability. This world-renowned skeptical organization promotes critical thinking by reaching out to the public and media with reliable information about paranormal and supernatural claims. But besides the Foundation's famous founder and the Million Dollar Challenge, the JREF is notable for its commitment to education. This week on Skepticality, science educator and grassroots skeptical organizer Michael Blanford discusses his role as Director of Educational Programs for the JREF. Michael describes ongoing and upcoming educational programs \u2014 and how skeptics can help. About this week's feature article In this week's eSkeptic, Joel Carlinsky recounts psychoanalyst Wilhelm Reich's developement of pseudoscientific psychotherapy, sensational claims and extreme theories and their effect on the scientific world. This article appeared in [Skeptic magazine volume 2, number 3](https://www.skeptic.com/magazine/archives/vol02n03.html) in 1994. Joel Carlinsky is a long-time student of Orgonomy and the works of Wilhelm Reich and his followers. His critiques and analyses have drawn the attention of Orgonomists, for which he has officially been declared an \"Emotional Plague Character,\" an actual diagnosis in Orgonomy Therapy. Epigones of Orgonomy The Incredible History of Wilhelm Reich and his Followers by Joel Carlinsky In 1957 Wilhelm Reich, famed psychiatrist and \"discoverer\" of Orgone energy, died in a Federal prison while serving a two-year term for contempt of court. Many people, not least the Food and Drug Administration which had brought charges against him, thought that that was the last anyone would hear of Orgone Accumulators and the rest of Reich's highly original ideas. They were wrong. Today, 37 years after Reich's death, Orgonomy, the \"science\" of the Life Energy, is stronger than ever. The basis of this revival of Reich's \"scientific\" and psychiatric theories is a group called the American College of Orgonomy (A.C.O.), based in Princeton, New Jersey. The A.C.O. is composed mostly of psychiatrists who use Reich's method of psychotherapy, which is called \"Orgone Therapy.\" The A.C.O. is very far to the right of the political spectrum. The A.C.O. is into a lot more than just scamming a quick buck from gullible patients who have been led to think their sex life will be better if they pay an Orgonomist to fix it. They are also involved in Wilhelm Reich's method of rainmaking in a big way. Known as \"cloudbusting,\" this technique was invented by Reich in 1952 and consists of pointing hollow metal pipes at the sky and grounding the other end into water. By aiming the pipes properly, and, according to one recent issue of the Journal of Orgonomy, by having the proper \"intent\" (whatever that means), the operator can withdraw Orgone energy from the sky and induce rainfall. Wilhelm Reich was a figure unique in 20th century fringe movements. Once regarded as Freud's most brilliant pupil and probable successor, the courageous anti-Nazi activist parted company with mainstream science when he decided that Pasteur was wrong about spontaneous generation. A few years later Reich \"discovered\" the cosmic Life Energy which he named \"Orgone,\" and spent the rest of his eventful life doing research on Orgone energy. The \"science\" of Orgonomy, which he founded, included medical treatments claimed to be far more effective than anything known to orthodox medicine, meant to neutralize radioactivity; a motor that can run without fuel on free and unlimited cosmic energy; and a technology of weather control that he claimed could save the world from droughts and desertification. The Food and Drug Administration however, did not accept Reich's medical claims and eventually Reich wound up in Federal prison, where he died. Reich and his theories, however, were resurrected in the late 1960s. Dr. Ellsworth Baker, a psychiatrist who had studied under Reich, founded the American College of Orgonomy in 1967. The college publishes a slick, professional-looking journal called the Journal of Orgonomy. This journal publishes reports on weather control with Reich's cloudbuster; cancer research with the Orgone Accumulator (which concentrates Orgone energy out of the air); creation of life by means of \"Bion\" experiments; and their unique form of psychiatric treatment, called \"Orgone Therapy.\" Political articles of a far right orientation are standard fare, especially attacking \"liberals\" as mentally ill and therefore a form of social cancer. Most of the 30 or so members of the A.C.O. are psychiatrists. Most of the 4,000 or so people who have donated money to the A.C.O. fundraising campaign ($5,000,000 to date) are patients or former patients. This exploitation of emotionally vulnerable people is facilitated by the fact that Orgone Therapy seems to render the patient more or less permanently emotionally dependent on the therapist. In any case, it is a flagrant breach of ethics for psychiatrists to solicit funds from patients for a cause in which the doctor has an interest. The A.C.O. has a very active outreach program to spread the word. They encourage gift subscriptions of their journal to university libraries. They have a speakers' bureau. They hold frequent conventions here and abroad, and offer training programs and laboratory courses. Almost all of the people who get involved have had Orgone Therapy or go into Orgone Therapy subsequently; indeed, it is claimed that one cannot do successful work in Orgonomic biology, physics, or meteorology without having had \"psychiatric restructuring\" by Orgone Therapy. Their theories on medicine, psychiatry, microbiology, physics, biophysics, sociology, politics, meteorology, astronomy, childraising, ancient history, and just about every other subject imaginable are totally at odds with those of establishment science. In spite of this (or because of it) they constantly reiterate the theme that Reich was the greatest genius in history and was persecuted as Christ was; that Orgonomists today are persecuted; that they have great knowledge and wisdom unknown to the rest of humanity (and that cannot be understood or appreciated by those who have not had Orgone Therapy); and that all social and environmental problems can be dealt with only by their enlightened leadership. The most prominent member of the organization is not a psychiatrist. James Demeo, author of [The Orgone Accumulator Handbook](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0962185507?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0962185507), did his M.A. thesis on the Reich cloudbuster at the University of Kansas. He met with some faculty opposition but the degree was granted. He later did his Ph.D. work on a sociological and historical theory that all social problems \u2014 yes, all \u2014 including war, violence, injustice, patriarchial families, mental illness, environmental destruction, etc., are due solely to droughts and desertification. Dr. Demeo now makes his living doing lectures and workshops on Orgonomy all over the world, selling books and devices related to Orgonomy, and using his cloudbuster to \"break droughts.\" His \"Drought Abatement Outreach Program\" has been advertised in midwestern farm journals, and cloudbusting expeditions to bring rain have been paid for by drought-stricken farmers in Montana and elsewhere. Dr. Demeo claims to be responsible for most of the rain that has fallen in California in recent years, although he is silent on the subject of liability for flood damage. He also claims to have made rain in Germany, Greece, Israel, Arizona, and various other places, all of which, he asserts, were in dire need of his services. In fact, he claims, the rapid spreading of deserts threatens to engulf the entire world and can only be fought with cloudbusters, which only he and his associates are qualified to utilize properly. Demeo solicits donations to his \"research fund\" through a tax-exempt non-profit foundation he has set up. On at least one occasion funds contributed for one purpose seem to have been used for another purpose. He also is a partner in a commercial business venture using the cloudbuster. Currently, he is asking for $300,000 to establish a laboratory in northern California. He just might get it; his mentor and close associate, Dr. Richard Blasband, former President of the A.C.O., got $144,000, $48,000 of it from Lawrence Rockefeller via the Rockefeller Foundation, to do a study designed to prove the Orgone Accumulator violates the Second Law of Thermodynamics. Demeo publishes articles in the Journal of Orgonomy frequently. But he also publishes his own journal, Pulse of the Planet, which documents his weather control activities and energetically denounces anyone who dares to criticize him. He has also published a number of pamphlets as well as the [The Orgone Accumulator Handbook](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0962185507?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0962185507), but has not managed to get anything into the refereed scientific journals. He claims otherwise. He also claims expertise in an impressively (and impossibly) large number of fields. In fact, one gets a distinct impression from his resume that if Wilhelm Reich once wrote about it, James Demeo is an expert on it. While much concerned with scientific respectability, Demeo also loses no opportunity to gain exposure to a \"New Age\" audience. He has been frequently published and interviewed in Wildfire, a magazine put out by the \"Bear Tribe Medicine Society,\" a new-age type cult of white middle-class converts to Native American religions founded by the late Sun Bear, a medicine man who was criticized by his fellow Indians for mass-marketing their religion and culture to white dilettantes. Demeo has been a teacher at their \"Medicine Wheel Gatherings\" and has received thousands of dollars in contributions from well-intentioned yuppies who think they are thereby helping the earth by funding his rainmaking work. Another frequent outlet for Demeo's promotional articles, interviews, and advertising for rainmaking services is Acres USA, a New Age farm journal published in Kansas City, with a circulation of about 10,000 midwestern farmers. Acres mixes radionics machines for improving crop yields and homeopathy for farm animals, with farm-oriented conspiracy theories and support for the Posse Commitatus movement. (The conspiracy is by government, banking, and big business against the farmer.) Some of their readers have hired Demeo to break droughts. \"...Reich was solidly convinced that the Food and Drug Administration's legal case against him was due to a communist conspiracy ordered by the KGB to discredit his work in the United States so Russia could gain a monopoly on Orgonomic science.\" Although psychiatry is still the major source of income in Orgonomy, a new organization was recently formed exclusively for cloudbusting. Called the CORE (for Cosmic Orgone Engineering) network, it held a conference in Oregon. Attending was Matt Ryan, former editor of Wildfire, who is now employed by a New Age guru at Mt. Shasta. Mr. Ryan, who seems to have given up being a neo-Indian, was trained in cloudbusting by the late Jerome Eden, author of numerous books and articles in which he argued that hostile UFOs were the cause of droughts, an idea first promulgated by Reich in the 1950s. Also present, but perhaps unlikely to remain active in Orgonomy for much longer, was Dr. Blasband, who has recently become a devotee of a popular faith-healer to whom he is now recommending to his medical colleagues that they send their patients. In his last few years Reich was solidly convinced that the Food and Drug Administration's legal case against him was due to a communist conspiracy ordered by the KGB to discredit his work in the United States so Russia could gain a monopoly on Orgonomic science. Not surprisingly, many of today's Reichians are conspiracy buffs of one kind or another. One, James Martin, a publisher and small-press mail order book and magazine distributor, has a regular Reichian-conspiracy column in the conspiracy journal Steamshovel Press, which publishes any and all conspiracy theories, no matter how improbable. Martin, who also publishes his own conspiracy-oriented magazine and book catalog, called Flatland, thinks AIDS is due to bio-logical warfare; in this he differs with his good friend Jim Demeo, who thinks AIDS does not exist and is all a hoax by the government to scare teenagers away from sex. Orgonomy is not confined to the United States. The A.C.O. has held conferences in Germany, France, and Argentina. Orgonomic groups exist in Greece, Israel, Japan, and especially Germany. The Greek and Israeli groups have done cloudbusting under Demeo's supervision and the German group, which is large, well- funded, and based in Berlin, has had him over there several times for lectures and workshops. They have a large, well-equipped laboratory in Berlin and another in the town of Eberf\u00fcrt. Most of the members of the German group are medical doctors and, unlike their colleagues in the United States, they are free to use Orgone Accumulators on patients with cancer and other serious illnesses and they do so. Orgonomy is growing and it will not likely go away. Psychiatrists and mental health professionals take courses in Orgonomic procedures and faculty members at various colleges and universities arrange for Orgonomists to give guest lectures. Many educators and childcare professionals are heavily influenced by Orgonomic theories. I venture to predict that Orgonomy will be one of the key New Age movements to watch in the decade ahead.

Or was he? A lone assassin, that is? Yes, he was, but that is not what anyone giving informal tours of the plaza will have you believe if you give them a few minutes (and a few by Michael Shermer and Bernard Leikind Ever since the publication of physicist Dr. Bernard Leikind's article in Skeptic (see [eSkeptic for June 9, 2010](https://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/10-06-09/#feature)) and my [subsequent column in Scientific American](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=can-you-hear-me-now) in which I cited Leikind's arguments (both of which were skeptical of claims that cell phone use causes brain cancer), we have been inundated with letters disputing our skepticism. The letters come in a variety of flavors, so what follows are Dr. Leikind's responses to [the critics](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=can-you-hear-me-now#comments) that he identifies by their email names. My own response to critics will appear in the next issue of Scientific American, so in the meantime I defer to Dr. Leikind's responses below, as well as to the SkepDoc Harriet Hall, M.D. along with oncologist Dr. David Gorski, both of whom blog at [ScienceBasedMedicine.org](http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/), which covers the ongoing controversy over cell phones and cancer. For example, when I queried her on my critics, Dr. Hall responded to me: I agree that it is premature to say that cell phones \"can't possibly\" cause cancer, although Leikind is correct to say physics shows they can't possibly do it by the mechanisms that have been commonly proposed. The fact remains: there is no good evidence that cell phones do cause cancer. And so far I'm not convinced by the proposed mechanisms by which they might cause cancer. The radiation/mutation and tissue heating explanations have pretty well been debunked. I'm going to continue to think that cell phones don't cause cancer \u2014 and that there is a high probability that the kind of radiation they emit \"can't\" cause cancer \u2014 until I see something much more convincing in the way of evidence. If they do somehow cause cancer, studies to date have established that any effect can't be a very large one. Any potential cancer risk pales against the high risk of accidents from using them while driving, and against the convenience and safety effects of having instant communication. And I asked Dr. Gorski as well, and he responded to me thusly (with links to further reading): Basically, as I said, the article is correct in dubbing the idea that cell phone radiation causes cancer as very, very improbable, but I thought Leikind went too far in declaring it \"impossible\" based a priori on physics because, quite frankly, he completely ignores newer biological understanding of mechanisms of carcinogenesis. As I said in my post, I do not believe that cell phones cause cancer. I consider it highly unlikely and implausible. I do think, however, that declaring it \"impossible\" is premature.

And those effects cannot cause cancer, and we know this because there are many identical but more powerful similar effects, such as exercise. No one thinks that exercise causes cancer. I also find it persuasive that no one is concerned about cell phone microwaves causing skin cancer. But the radiation is more intense in our hands, ears, and scalp than it is in brains or optic or auditory nerves, and skin cells reproduce many times more frequently than any glial brain cells, and even many more times more frequently than any neuron cells. Dr. Leikind's responses to the posted critiques of my and his claims follow: GreenMind suspects that I may have ties to the cell phone industry. I use an old model Motorola RAZR V3 cell phone and pay T-Mobile about $40 per month for my cell phone service. I would be happy to earn some money from my investigation and writing about cell phones and cancer. The precautionary principle draws passionate support from public health care professional, Dr. Martin Donohoe. In the case of cell phone microwave radiation, scientists have already done the appropriate research. We know exactly what happens when any material, including living tissue, absorbs microwave radiation. The microwave energy appears as additional shaking, jostling, rattling and rolling of the molecules. In a living human being with her powerful temperature control mechanisms functioning and her blood flowing, we know that there is no potential for microwave radiation from a cell phone to cause significant, widespread or irreparable harm. Therefore, the precautionary principle does not apply. The situation is different when someone invents a new chemical. The precautionary principle would apply to eating cell phones but not to talking on them. It would not apply to texting while driving because the harmful potential is well known. Freedom for All and dideldum worry about power levels and heating. A cell phone emits about a watt of microwave radiation. Some of that power enters the user's hand, ear, scalp, skull, and brain and other tissues. To produce this watt of microwave radiation, the cell phone's electronics must convert somewhat more than a watt of power from its batteries. The excess power and all of the power that goes to operate the circuitry of the phone appears as a temperature increase in the phone. The phone may feel warm. This energy transfers to the user's hand or ear. Some may transfer to the environment by infrared radiation or convection. This energy does not cause cancer. The temperature increase in the human brain from absorbed cell phone microwave radiation is so small that many researchers mistakenly believe that there are non-thermal effects. The temperature never reaches the various potentially harmful temperatures that Freedom cites. GreenMind questions Dr. Shermer's and my statement that there is no known mechanism by which cell phone microwaves might cause cancer. I claim more than that there is no known mechanism. I assert that there is no unknown mechanism. To summarize, here is the proof. We know exactly what happens to the cell phone microwaves the body absorbs. The energy transfers from the radiation to jostling, jiggling, vibrating and twisting of the molecules. From there, the energy enters to flowing blood, reaches the entire body, and moves to the environment. If the power flow is large, the transfer to the environment will occur primarily by the evaporation of sweat. For the watt or less absorbed from cell phones, the transfer will occur by small changes to the flow of blood to the body's surface causing slight increases in radiation, conduction, and convection to the environment. There is little temperature increase in a living human being from cell phone microwaves. We know many other processes and effects that produce exactly the same effects at much greater energy and power levels, and all of these are safe and do not cause cancer. Exercise is one such process. Wearing a ski cap is another. Any researcher who proposes a mechanism by which cell phone radiation might trigger or enhance carcinogenesis is welcome to do so, but must begin with the process described, and also explain why much larger, but otherwise identical processes, do not trigger the proposed mechanism. This thought informs my consideration of the many real and supposed physiological effects of microwave radiation cited by readers. In the following, I use colloquial language but I could have used the technical terms. Knowledgeable scientists will recognize what these are. I mention specific readers in these notes, but often other readers made similar points. Richard2010 correctly asserts that it might be possible to modify the complicated and lengthy process by which an initiating incident leads to cancer. He says that microwaves might influence any of the intermediate steps that do not involve breakage of DNA. The only means by which cell phone microwave radiation might influence those steps is through the jiggling, jostling, rocking and rolling that occur when the organism's thermal control system is functioning. Test tube experiments that do not reproduce the stable temperature conditions in a living organism, however, are not relevant. While some can imagine putative carcinogenic mechanisms from electromagnetic radiation, the only forms of electromagnetic radiation that cause cancer, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays, operate by breaking chemical bonds in DNA. Megahurtz, Richard2010, and many other readers assert that microwaves have physiological effects. Some readers cite Russian studies, well known to researchers in this field. Western scientists could not replicate the Russian studies, and do not credit them. Readers point to therapeutic methods. Every therapeutic method that involves microwaves begins with the process I describe. Therapeutic use of microwaves always involves heating tissues. Monastralblue asserts that microwaves modify chemical bonds or transfer molecules from one quantum state to another nearby state without breaking the bonds. Quantum states of molecules that differ by such a small amount of energy that a microwave photon might cause a transition from one state, the supposedly safe one, to another, the supposedly bad one, will be virtually equally populated in the living organism because of the random shaking, rattling, and rolling of the organism's molecules. The supposedly bad state will not be empty. If population of the supposed state were bad in some way, carcinogenic or cancer enhancing, then the state would be doing its dirty work at all times. fscr37 says that Dr. Shermer and I have unstated assumptions and implies that these may be unjustified. The primary scientific assumption that pertains to the question of cell phones and cancer is that the laws of physics apply to biological systems, to organisms, just as they apply to anything else. The various speculative models, such as the resonance effects to which fscr37 refers, are unphysical and unbiological because they neglect to consider the environment in an organism when they supposedly occur. The energy exchange time, the time it takes for a molecule to transfer energy within its own modes of oscillation or with its neighbors, is about a hundred quadrillionths of a second, 10-13 seconds. This is the result of direct measurements. The oscillation periods of microwave radiation are about a hundred trillionth of a second, 10-10 seconds. That is, molecular jostling will interrupt any buildup of energy by any individual molecule or bond long before the processes frscr37 cites might develop. Iward notes that the risk that a cell may become cancerous relates to the rate at which it divides. In the brain, for example, neurons divide rarely, if at all, while glial cells divide more often. In adults, brain cancers are gliomas, not neuromas. If there were some effect of microwaves on carcinogenesis related to the division rate of cells, we'd expect that the microwaves might cause skin cancer in phone users' hands, ears, and scalp. The skin cells divide much more rapidly than any brain cells, and the intensity of the radiation is higher in these skin cells than in any brain cells. Cell phone radiation does not cause skin cancer, and no one fears that it might. Iward, hereticoftruth, Mark Pine guess that cell phone microwave radiation might have chemical effects other than breaking DNA molecules and refer specifically to denaturing of enzymes. Large, complex biological molecules (and small ones too) take on their shapes through a combination of strong covalent bonds and many weaker chemical bonds, such as hydrogen bonds, van der Waals bonds, and others. Denaturing a molecule refers to the process by which the molecule assumes another form, denaturing. It assumes the denatured form by breaking bonds, mostly weak ones. A cell phone's microwave radiation absorbed by a living human being cannot denature any biological protein or enzyme unless that radiation can substantially increase the tissue's temperature in the living organism. High power microwave radiation, much higher than from any cell phone, may damage the cornea in this way. Cooking tissue is bad, but does not cause cancer. Rivk, tomerg compares microwave cooking with absorbing microwave radiation from a cell phone. Sending microwave power into a roast in a microwave oven causes the temperature of the meat to rise. Sending the same microwave power into a living human being causes the person to sweat with little temperature increase. Dr. Eleanor Adair and others have done this experiment many times. Microwaving a human being causes sweat, not cancer. Can readers guess the difference between a cut of meat and a human being? Microwaving a person with power levels similar to those of a microwave oven is safe and does not cause cancer. It is not a good idea to microwave a man's testicles because they prefer temperatures lower than core body temperature. It is a bad idea to microwave your cornea or lens because they have little or no blood supply to provide cooling. Kiya, jschunke, and pradhangegeorge say that they and other people are hypersensitive to electromagnetic radiation and cite personal experience of these effects from their cell phone use. There is no such thing as electromagnetic sensitivity. It is an imaginary ailment. All double blind tests show that no one can tell if a cell phone or cell phone tower is radiating except through the usual human senses, such as looking at the screen or holding the phone and noting that it is warm. There have been many amusing reports of locals developing vague symptoms when the phone company installs a tower, symptoms that disappear when investigation reveals that the company has not yet installed the amplifiers. Perhaps Kiya would be less prone to headaches if he or she were to choose less annoying people to talk to. Richard2010 refers to non-thermal effects of microwave radiation. There are none in living organisms, in humans. This fact has not prevented mistaken researchers from doing studies and publishing about non-thermal effects. These researchers mistake the fact that they do not observe a temperature increase with something non-thermal taking place. By their definition, an ice cube melting in a glass of tea or water boiling would be non-thermal effects, but they are thermal effects. Every effect of cell phone microwave radiation must be a thermal effect because the absorbed energy goes into shaking, wiggling, rocking and rolling of the molecules. None of the energy goes anywhere else. If this causes changes to the blood-brain barrier, just to choose one example, then plenty of other things would also cause changes to the blood-brain barrier, such as wearing a ski cap. Wearing a ski cap is safe as long as it doesn't cover your eyes. Islesin refers to a comment in Microwave News. This journal has long added to the public's fears of imagined harm from electromagnetic fields. Scientific American readers may remember the kerfuffle about potential harm from high voltage power lines and household appliances. Microwave News was on the wrong side of that issue too. On the Internet I am often known as Left Coast Bernard. I say to my neighbor, CaliforniaJoe, that photons are the chunks of energy that carry all forms of electromagnetic radiation, not just visible light. Agdavis comments on the units in Dr. Shermer's column, which come from my Skeptic magazine essays. Chemists like to use kJ/mol, kilojoules per mole, which is an energy density, because they like matters relevant to test tube quantities. Using kJ/mol to refer to the energy in a chemical bond is telling us how much energy is in an Avogadro number of bonds, 6 X 1023. An Avogadro number of things is known as a mole, abbreviated mol. A watt-hour is a unit of energy (not a watt per hour); Joules. Physicists would prefer to use a density, just as chemists do. They would refer to Joules/bond or Joules/molecule, while the chemists like Joules per mole, a much larger, test tube sized number. Another reader confuses a mole of cell phones with a mole of photons from a cell phone. Comparing the energy in a mole of chemical bonds with the energy in a mole of microwave photons is correct thinking because it is also comparing the energy in a single bond with the energy in a single photon. The physical effect is, as always, one photon to one bond. Microwave photons do not have sufficient energy to modify any chemical bond, strong or weak. Monastralblue comments upon safety factors. Here is the way, roughly speaking, that the appropriate organizations establish safety factors for non-ionizing radiation. Since it is a well-established fact that this radiation transfers its energy into tissues as additional shaking, rattling, and rolling, the safety committees find the lowest detectable power level that produces a detectable temperature change, not the lowest level at which some harm occurs. Then they divide this level by 10 or 100. This becomes the official safe level. Exceeding the safe level only means that some temperature increase might be noticed, not that any harm would occur.

In this lecture by Leonard Mlodinow, based on his [co-authored book](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0553385461?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0553385461) with Stephen Hawking, answers to these ultimate questions are answers based on the most recent scientific evidence. For example, Mlodinow and Hawking show that according to quantum theory, the cosmos does not have just a single existence or history, but rather that every possible history of the universe exists simultaneously.

Why are we here? Why is there something rather than nothing? What is the nature of reality? Why are the laws of nature so finely tuned as to allow for the existence of beings like ourselves? And, finally, is the apparent \"grand design\" of our universe evidence of a benevolent creator who set things in motion \u2014 or does science offer another explanation? In this lecture by Leonard Mlodinow, based on his [co-authored book](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0553385461?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0553385461) with Stephen Hawking, answers to these ultimate questions are answers based on the most recent scientific evidence. For example, Mlodinow and Hawking show that according to quantum theory, the cosmos does not have just a single existence or history, but rather that every possible history of the universe exists simultaneously. When applied to the universe as a whole, this idea calls into question the very notion of cause and effect.

Skepticality Inside Consumer Reports One of the most positive aspects of the skeptical movement is advocacy for consumer awareness about the claims made by producers and advertisers of all sorts of products, from the outlandish to the commonplace. This week on Skepticality, Swoopy talks with Robert Tiernan, Managing Editor of Consumer Reports magazine, the monthly publication produced by The Consumers Union. For nearly 75 years, the Consumers Union has utilized rigorous scientific testing to separate hype from fact and good products from bad ones \u2014 empowering consumers to think more critically about everything from cars to health care. MonsterTalk The Iceman Goeth Late in the 1960s, in the era which gave us the famous Patterson-Gimlin Bigfoot film, fairgoers in Minnesota were confronted with a marvel: a hairy, primitive-looking humanoid frozen in a block of ice. Was it an anthropological relic? Was it a sasquatch? As investigators from the Smithsonian Institute and cryptozoological researchers studied the frozen creature, they came to very different conclusions as to what it represented. The MonsterTalk hosts interview Bigfoot researcher and former side-show performer Matt Crowley \u2014 and try to crack the case of The Minnesota Iceman. About this week's feature article In this critical review of paleontologist Simon Conway Morris's book [Life's Solution: Inevitable Humans in a Lonely Universe](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0521603250?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0521603250), paleontologist Dr. Donald Prothero deconstructs the myth of progress and evolution. Morris argues that convergent evolution means certain features will inevitably arise in nature such as eyes and ears, limbs and brains, and therefore these solutions become unavoidable and thus predictable. This book review appeared in [Skeptic magazine volume 10, number 3](https://www.skeptic.com/magazine/archives/vol10n03.html) in 2003. Inevitable Humans? Or Hidden Agendas? a book review by Dr. Donald Prothero The optimist sees a glass and says it's half full; the pessimist says it's half empty. So goes the classic metaphor for how our expectations and beliefs can bias our judgment and perception, and cause us to see only what we want to see. We're all familiar with examples of how Creationists can take straightforward scientific facts and twist them to fit their peculiar view of the world. Almost as soon as we detect this bias, our baloney alarms go off, and we read their arguments much more skeptically, because we have good reason to doubt that they have used the facts correctly. But the bias is not just among Creationists. All humans have a tendency to see and emphasize what fits their preconceptions, and ignore what does not. Scientists like to think of themselves as \"objective\" and not prone to those biases, but as many philosophers of science have pointed out, this is not true. Scientists are all too human, and their perceptions are largely affected by the culture in which they live, as well as how they were trained. No matter how \"objective\" scientists try to be, they are subject to all sorts of cultural and social expectations that distort their interpretations. Unfortunately, many scientists are unaware of these prejudices or unwilling to recognize that they might be subject to them, but the effects are there just the same. We all have a tendency to seek \"facts\" that are part of our theoretical universe, whether we are conscious of this or not. Darwin believed that he was objective in accumulating facts in an inductive fashion, but during a moment of candor, he wrote, \"How odd it is that anyone should not see that all observation must be for or against some view if it is to be of any service.\" \"Innocent, unbiased observation is a myth\" This bias is particularly apparent when scientists (and other people) begin to speculate outside the normal realm of testable hypotheses, and try to answer ultimate questions such as: \"Are we alone in the universe?\" or \"What are the chances of there being another form of intelligent life like us?\" These kinds of questions lead to non-scientific speculations about the meaning of our existence, or how humanity's status in the universe casts light on religious and philosophical questions of that nature. Science-fiction writers have long worked from the premise that some other form of alien life exists out there, looks something like us, and can communicate with us. Such optimism led to the SETI project, and to movies and novels ranging from H.G. Wells' pessimistic [War of the Worlds](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1936594056?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1936594056) to Steven Spielberg's more optimistic view of aliens in [Close Encounters of the Third Kind](https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/close-encounters-third-kind/id557265666?at=10l6ex) and ET, and a less anthropomorphic view of aliens in Carl Sagan's [Contact](https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/contact/id279598767?at=10l6ex). But these kinds of portrayals have always been relegated to science fiction, and are not taken seriously by scientists in the relevant fields. When trained scientists have speculated on such matters, they tend to be less optimistic. For decades, the scientific literature on the topic has been nearly unanimous that the evolution of humans on this planet was a unique and unlikely event, and that even if alien life existed on other planets, it would have little chance of resembling us. George Gaylord Simpson put the arguments in their clearest form in his 1964 essay \"On the nonprevalence of humanoids\" (Science, v. 143, pp. 769-775). More recently, Stephen Jay Gould argued in a number of books that chance and contingency are important factors in evolution, and that evolution is not predestined to follow a certain path that, as the anthropocentric bias dictates, eventually leads to us. The history of life could have been played out in a near infinite number of alternate scenarios if one or two events early in the sequence had occurred differently. Gould made this contingency argument most strongly in his 1989 book [Wonderful Life: The Burgess Shale and the Nature of History](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/039330700X?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=039330700X) (W. W. Norton), which popularized the amazing soft-bodied Cambrian fauna from the Burgess Shale of Canada. Gould argued that with so many bizarre experimental body forms (most of which do not survive today), there was no way of predicting what the future shape of life would be like from this early experimental phase. (The title of the book refers to the famous Frank Capra movie, [It's a Wonderful Life](https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/its-a-wonderful-life/id297250466?at=10l6ex), where Jimmy Stewart gets to view an alternate future predicated on a very slight difference in initial conditions \u2014 in this case, that his character had never been born). Our ancestors include the Burgess Shale fossil known as Pikaia, which was just a tiny wormlike lancelet back then, and a very minor part of the fauna, so that a Cambrian biologist would have no way of guessing that eventually the vertebrate body plan would be a great success, and most of the other types would die out. If the tape of life had been rewound and replayed, perhaps some other group would have dominated, and we would not be sitting here speculating about it! This argument is neither surprising nor novel to most scientists, and there has been very little disagreement with it in the scientific community \u2014 until now. Simon Conway Morris, a respected Cambridge paleontologist and one of the world's experts on the Burgess Shale fauna, has seen fit to disagree with Gould (and prevailing scientific opinion) wherever possible. His first attempt was his 1998 book [The Crucible of Creation: The Burgess Shale and the Rise of Animals](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0192862022?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0192862022) (Oxford University Press), his counter to Gould's Wonderful Life. In this book, he argued that the Burgess Shale fauna isn't quite as bizarre as earlier accounts (not just those of Gould's but even in his own writings) suggested. In this latest book, [Life's Solution](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0521603250?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0521603250), he takes issue with Gould again, but sadly Steve is no longer alive to answer him. Conway Morris is clearly bothered by the materialistic and non-anthropocentric implications of a history of life where chance events are important, and by the idea that humans are just an accidental by-product of chance events, not the likely end-product of the evolutionary process. Consequently, almost the entire book is an extended paean to the phenomenon of evolutionary convergence and parallelism. In this interpretation, evolutionary and functional constraints mean that only certain biological engineering solutions can work, and they have evolved more than once. Accordingly, we have the evolution of the camera-like eye in many unrelated groups, as well as such highly specialized features such as eusociality, echolocation, ovoviviparity, many different biochemical pathways, and examples too numerous to list here (since they take up most of his book, there's no need to repeat them). From this, Conway Morris argues that many of the features that make us human have evolved in parallel at least once elsewhere, so the evolution of some combination of humanoid features is inevitable. \"Conway Morris argues that many of the features that make us human have evolved in parallel at least once elsewhere, so the evolution of some combination of humanoid features is inevitable.\" But is this really true? The camera-like eye did evolve more than once, but most of the features that make us human have not been repeated anywhere else in the animal kingdom \u2014 especially not our disproportionately large brains, and all the attendant cultural phenomena. (In answer to this conundrum, Conway Morris falls back on the relatively weak arguments about crude tool use and social development in other animals, but this has always been a poor analogy). Nowhere does his argument address all the other disparate factors that had to come together to make us human over the past 10 million years: just the right lineage of bipedal apes, living in the right combination of environments to promote culture and brain evolution, and surviving in a world that became increasingly inhospitable as the Ice Ages waxed. Most of the convergences Conway Morris discusses seem impressive at first, but after a while, they remind the reader that most organisms are composed largely of unique features that are not convergent, and have never appeared more than once. Convergence is the rare exception in most groups of animals and plants, not the widespread rule. If all organisms were as highly convergent as Conway Morris suggests, then they would all tend to look alike, and we would never be able to tell them apart, let alone analyze their evolutionary relationships. Conway Morris' book is philosophically more in tune with the scientific literature of the 1950s and early 1960s, which viewed convergence as widespread, and despaired of ever telling whether groups had a unique evolutionary origin, because certain suites of anatomical features tend to appear more than once. But the whole thrust of systematic theory since the late 1960s has been driven by the cladistic revolution, which emphasizes unique evolutionary novelties, and underlined the fact that most organisms are not composed largely of convergent characters, but can be uniquely related to other organisms by these anatomical novelties. Indeed, cladistics has made it easier to recognize convergence (there's a huge literature on this topic, where it is known as the phenomenon of homoplasy). Nevertheless, the overwhelming conclusion of all this analysis is that it's a relatively rare phenomenon (except in a few groups that are very simple and stereotyped). Conway Morris, not surprisingly, has always been hostile to cladistics, so naturally he does not appreciate this perspective. Let's take Conway Morris' argument seriously and ask how we could test his hypothesis. If the evolution of humans is inevitable, why didn't it happen before in more than 600 million years of the evolution of multicellular animals? For example, the dinosaurs ruled the earth for over 150 million years, and some evolved very large brains relative to their body size (such as the dromaeosaurs, popularized by \"Velociraptor\" from the Jurassic Park movies and books). But they still didn't evolve human intelligence, let alone complex social structure or culture and tools. In fact, paleontologist Dale Russell became a laughingstock of the profession when he commissioned an artist to make a sculpture of a \"dinosauroid,\" an imagined human-like descendant of the dromaeosaurs \u2014 it looked like something out of bad science fiction, and clearly showed his own anthropomorphic biases. It also underlined the improbability that any other lineage would ever evolve into something like us, even though the dinosaurs had over 100 million years to do so (while we only took 6 million years as a family to evolve). More important, he misses Gould's critical point about contingency. Would we even be discussing this issue if the dinosaurs had not died out, allowing mammals to then take over the world, producing a lineage of primates to evolve into us? The dinosaurs were not failures that were eventually pushed out by mammals eating their eggs. Instead, dinosaurs were supremely successful for over 100 million years, forcing mammals to exist in tiny and nocturnal niches the entire time, since both dinosaurs and mammals appeared side-by-side in the Late Triassic, about 200 million years ago. There's no reason to doubt that dinosaurs would still dominate today if they hadn't been wiped out by a rock from space, or great volcanic eruptions, or whatever did them in. This was a random event that could not have been predicted, despite the fact that dinosaurs were well adapted to the world of the Cretaceous, not poorly adapted creatures destined to failure, as the popular metaphor would have it. And that indeed is the most crucial point of all that Conway Morris completely ignores, but which was central to Gould's original argument. Once groups of organisms are established and develop a body plan and set of niches, biological constraints are such that convergence and parallelism can be expected. But the issue of who gets this head start in the first place may be more a matter of luck and contingency that has nothing to do with adaptation. Returning to the Burgess Shale example, what if Pikaia (and the lineage of primitive chordates leading to vertebrates) had not survived? It certainly doesn't look like a sure winner compared to most of the more spectacular Burgess beasties. If it hadn't survived, there would have been no vertebrates, and half the examples of convergence that Conway Morris details could not have occurred, because they are peculiar to the basic vertebrate body plan, and not shared in any other phylum. Without vertebrates surviving the Cambrian, humans were not inevitable, since not even Conway Morris would argue that another group could have produced something like us. The jointed-legged phylum Arthropoda contains the most successful, diverse, and numerous organisms on the land, in the sea, and in the air today. This phylum includes the huge numbers and varieties of insects, spiders, scorpions, mites, ticks, millipedes, centipedes, and crustaceans. As numerous and diverse as they are, their habit of molting their exoskeletons when they grow means they can never exceed a certain body size \u2014 they would fall apart like a blob of jelly during their soft stage after molting without any skeletal support. (This, of course, is the reason why the huge insects in bad Sci-Fi movies are biologically impossible). Mollusks? They may be supremely successful producing clams, snails, and squids in the oceans, and a few land snails, but their body plan yields few convergences with vertebrates, let alone humans. And phyla such as the Echinodermata (sea stars, sea urchins, sea cucumbers, brittle stars, and sea lilies) are even more closely related to vertebrates. Yet they are even less likely to produce a humanoid due to their peculiar specializations, such as a radial symmetry with no head or tail, spiny calcite plates, and lack of eyes. In addition, they lack any sort of circulatory, respiratory, or excretory system, so they are forever bound to marine waters of normal salinity. When you examine the list of survivors of the Cambrian world, the role of contingency in determining which body plans survived becomes more and more obvious \u2014 and the significance of the convergence that Conway Morris details in so many examples is moot. Given that Conway Morris has taken this optimistic view of how easily nature can make a humanoid, one would expect that he is equally optimistic about the potential for life (and even humanoids) on other planets. But here he switches gears entirely, adopting a hard-boiled skepticism about the various estimates of the probability of life on other planets. He even casts doubts on the many models for how life originated in the first place. No SETI fan, he relentlessly squashes all the cheerful estimates based on the discoveries of new planets, or the ideas about the potential for primitive life on Mars, Io, Europa, or other bodies in our solar system. Instead, he follows the school of thought that argues that Earth is a unique and special place, the only one with conditions capable of evolving humans, or for that matter, life as we know it (the anthropic principle). In this view, only Earth has just the right combination of features (neither too hot nor too cold, also known as the \"Goldilocks effect\"). Conway Morris' position seems very surprising, given his lack of skepticism for arguments about the inevitability of human origins. Usually, in a scientific trade book such as this, one expects a consistent tone toward all lines of argument, rather than such an abrupt shift of gears. This change in tone makes one wonder about the underlying motivation of the author. He's an optimist about the possibility that humans are the inevitable by-product of evolution, but a pessimist that any other planet has humanoids \u2014 how can someone take those two mutually contradictory positions? The mystery is answered in the last chapter, when the author reveals that the whole motivation for his position is religious. Early in the book he trashes and dispenses with the fundamentalist Creationists, but by the end his arguments appear equally slanted and biased. His final chapter bashes agnostic materialists like Gould and Dawkins and veers abruptly off into his own philosophical beliefs, musing about why he finds materialism and agnosticism inadequate to provide \"meaning\" to life. At this point, one wonders if he is writing for the judges of the Templeton Prize, which is awarded to those who try to reconcile science and religion, rather than for an audience of people interested solely in scientific questions. He quotes religious scientists and Christian apologists such as C.S. Lewis extensively, and it's clear that the entire book has been a thinly disguised defense for the traditional Christian viewpoint that humans are God's handiwork and the pinnacle of creation, and that no other universes are so favored by God. At this point, the reader feels cheated. It's one thing to read Christian apologists who select examples from science to support their point of view, and usually give away their biases from the start. But Conway Morris ends up being a stealth apologist in pretending that his argument that humans are special was motivated strictly by the scientific evidence. In reality, from the very beginning, his biases caused him to select evidence to support this opinion, and to miss the point of arguments that did not. I much prefer the candor of someone like Gould or Dawkins, who identify their biases up front, or for that matter, even the openly Christian writers, because at least they're aware of their biases and not hiding them from the reader until the end. Well written trade science books are a vanishing breed, marketed to smaller and smaller audiences who are easily suckered into reading and believing pseudoscientific babble and religious tracts masquerading as science. What a pity that such a distinguished scientist as Conway Morris (who has produced much excellent science in the past) falls into the latter trap with this book. DR. DONALD R.

The Nature of Existence What if you could travel the world to ask scientists, artists, spiritual leaders, gurus, and everyday people why we exist? Documentary film-maker Roger Nygard (best known for his films about Star Trek fandom, Trekkies [1](https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/trekkies/id209206468?at=10l6ex) and [2](https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/trekkies-2/id268253815?at=10l6ex)) did just that, conducting over 170 interviews to explore The Nature of Existence. This week on Skepticality, Swoopy talks with Roger about his journey across the globe, and what he discovered during his compelling conversations with people of faith and science (including Richard Dawkins, Leonard Susskind, and Skeptics Society founder Michael Shermer). About this week's feature article In 1998, at eleven years of age, a young girl named Emily Rosa published a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Emily had conceived and executed an experiment that challenged the basis of one of the most accepted \"alternative\" healing procedures known: Therapeutic Touch (TT). She became the youngest person ever to have a research paper published in a peer reviewed medical journal. In this week's feature article, Larry Sarner (chairman of the National Therapeutic Touch Study Group) discusses Emily Rosa's investigation. The [original Rosa paper](http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/279/13/1005) can be found on the JAMA website and [the raw data](http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/ttdata.html) can be found on [Quackwatch](http://www.quackwatch.com/), a site operated by senior co-author Stephen Barrett. This article appeared in [Skeptic magazine volume 6, number 2](https://www.skeptic.com/magazine/archives/vol06n02.html) in 1998. The \"Emily Event\" Emily Rosa and the Therapeutic Touch Wars by Larry Sarner APRIL FOOL'S DAY, 1998, DAWNED CLEAR AND WARM in New York City. Three people, with an ungainly piece of cardboard and a towel, exited a hotel overlooking Central Park and clambered into a limousine marked \"Emily.\" They picked their way through traffic towards Rockefeller Center and an appearance on NBC's Today Show, the first of many that day. Despite the weather, the Rosas were in the eye of a whirlwind of activity and controversy which continues only slighted abated today. It was the first day of an event unprecedented in the contemporary skeptical movement. Eleven-year-old Emily Rosa had conceived and executed an experiment that challenged the basis of one of the most accepted \"alternative\" healing procedures known: Therapeutic Touch (TT). It was reported in one of the most respected of medical journals \u2014 the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA). (Preliminary results of the experiment were originally published in Skeptic magazine [vol. 4, no. 4](https://www.skeptic.com/magazine/archives/vol04n04.html) (1996) and [vol. 5, no. 2](https://www.skeptic.com/magazine/archives/vol05n02.html) (1997) The appearances Emily and her parents made on April 1st were only the beginning. Michael Shermer, publisher of Skeptic, later made a post on the internet to announce \"Shermer on 20/20, Emily Everywhere!\" That was seemingly true. At latest count, 100 distinct print pieces appeared, including the front pages of the New York Times and Los Angeles Times; Associated Press, UPI, and Reuters syndicated stories (reprinted countless times, often on front pages). Time reported it as \"Emily's Little Experiment\" and People magazine's title, \"Touchy Touchy,\" revealed the sensitive nerve it had pressed. There was immediate coverage overseas in The Lancet and the British Medical Journal, and numerous op-ed pieces and letters to the editor appeared everywhere. Television coverage came on all of the evening network news broadcasts, the morning shows, special reports on Fox, CNN, and MSNBC, local coverage, and talk show appearances in Canada and Hollywood, not to mention Scientific American Frontiers coverage the previous November. National Public Radio's All Things Considered made the initial break of the story, and at least eight talk and news interviews/stories followed on local and syndicated radio, including a blurb on Paul Harvey's commentary. Out in cyberspace, at least 12 web sites have been discovered dealing with the experiment, and Usenet newsgroups logged over 500 postings, along with several lively discussions on privately run \"lists.\" So ubiquitous was the coverage that one exasperated TT supporter opined in cyberspace that what he termed the \"Emily Event\" was necessarily an orchestration by an evil conspiracy of Big Media, Big Science, Big Medicine, and Big Pharmaceuticals. Conspiracy theories aside, was the Emily Event all media hype, or did it have a wider and enduring importance? One hopes it has the latter, but only time will tell. Despite the uncertainty of the outcome, the nature of its importance is possible to outline. First, it shows a way for scientific medicine and nursing to deal with pseudoscientific proposals for practice, such as TT. Second, it vividly demonstrates the effectiveness of capturing the public imagination for a cause, even if that cause is something as fundamentally cerebral as skepticism and critical thinking. Nurse Heal Thyself For some time, scientifically-based medicine has been on the defensive from an onslaught of pseudoscientific, non-scientific, and even anti-scientific practices. The proponents of \"alternative,\" \"complementary,\" and now \"integrative\" medicine have been prying for years at openings in the scientific \"establishment.\" Having found a few weaknesses \u2014 not the least of which is political \u2014 their persistence is paying off. Emboldened by a lack of effective sanctions against them, many people whose reputations would have been destroyed by being labeled as charlatans and quacks not only openly promote their \"alternatives,\" but also feel free to attack their scientific detractors as cranks and reactionaries. The growth of anti-reason and anti-science in medicine is as much the consequence of a lack of response by scientific medicine as it is of anything else. The battle is not lost, however. Part of the immensity of the response to Emily's \"Little Experiment\" is due to a visceral acceptance on the part of the American public of the validity of reason and science. Put in its starkest terms, the public recognized through this event: - that a patently silly practice had become widespread in an important segment of health care; - that it could have been unmasked simply, but wasn't for 25 years; and - that it was literally child's play to do that unmasking. This \"Emperor's New Clothes\" story was not lost on the media when they discovered it. In fairness, it was not lost on the medical establishment, either, who published it, setting off the event. But as dramatic as it was, the Emperor aspect should not obscure the way in which the unmasking was done \u2014 by reporting good science (as JAMA editor George Lundberg characterized it), albeit long overdue. In other words, the Emily Event happened because scientific medicine finally did what it is supposed to do \u2014 science. How Emily Did It TT practitioners reacted to Emily's achievement with a visceral response. Most were ill-informed or logically fallacious (see below). Unable to refute the science itself, the attacks have now settled upon a single theme: that the Rosa paper (and JAMA) went too far in using a single experiment to \"disprove\" TT. That theme gets to the heart of the medical importance of the Emily Event. The original experiment did not set out to debunk TT, nor did the paper claim it. In actuality, however, TT was debunked \u2014 not as a refutation of the Human Energy Field concept (as erroneously claimed by Lundberg in a note accompanying an abstract of the article). Instead it discounted TT as a healing modality by mounting an empirical assault on the alleged basis for TT practice, i.e., on its five \"postulates,\" or rather on one of them. TT practice, as a \"unique and efficacious\" modality (the justification for practice), rests on its postulates in the following manner: The hands can be used to manifest a TT practitioner's intention to heal by detecting and eliminating differences in the HEF of a patient, thereby either returning the patient directly to health or removing impediments to the healing processes of the patient's own body. It can be readily seen that if any one of the postulates can be shown to be logically invalid or to contradict reality, then the TT hypothesis falls. The truth or reality of the others would then be irrelevant. Thus, if the HEF can be shown not to exist, contradicting the Existence Postulate (see point 1 in sidebar above), then TT practice would necessarily be shown as not a unique intervention. If the hands can be shown to be an unreliable means of effecting intentional changes to the health of a patient, contradicting the Manual Postulate (see point 5 in sidebar above), then the TT hypothesis would necessarily fall. And so on. Most of TT's skeptics have in the past focused on the Existence Postulate, probably because it has the least ring of truth to it. Its lack of objective detectability especially seems to beg for debunking. However unfortunate, disproof of the existence of the HEF has been intractable, and the Rosa paper did not attempt it. Most TT proponents have in the past focused on the Manual Postulate. They cite dozens of clinical studies which purport to show TT \"works.\" They have had the wrong handle on the logical problem. Even if the clinical studies demonstrated unequivocally the reliability and efficacy of TT's hand-waving (which they do not), it still says nothing about the truth of the other postulates. Because Emily's experiment utilized practitioners' hands, it appears that it was a test of the Manual Postulate. That has led many of TT's defenders to attack the paper for ignoring the \"numerous\" clinical studies which would appear to contradict Emily's results. It has also led some TT skeptics to attack the experiment for not being double-blinded (a necessary feature in clinical studies). Regardless of appearances, however, Emily's little experiment was not a test of the Manual Postulate. The Rosa paper reviewed the clinical studies extensively (and their mixed results). Logically, it did not need to do so, however. Those studies \u2014 and even double-blinding \u2014 were irrelevant to the logical argument being made in the paper. What the Emily experiment was in fact was a test of the Perceptibility Postulate (III). It was a refutation of the notion that practitioners can perceive an HEF under conditions where they should have been able to do so. The power of Emily's experiment was that chances were vanishingly small that the Perceptibility Postulate could be true if the experiment turned out as it did. That observational result constitutes a \"refutation,\" which leads inescapably to the inference that the TT hypothesis falls. And that in turn leads to the conclusion, explicitly made in the Rosa paper by its senior author, Stephen Barrett, MD that \"the further professional use of Therapeutic Touch is unjustified.\" It is that reasonable conclusion which apparently was compelling enough for the editorial board of the Journal of the American Medical Association, after an especially prolonged and intensive peer-review, to publish the study, despite its origin in a child's science-fair project. That origin, of course, is what captured the widespread attention of the media and medicine-watchers world-wide. And it is the magnitude of that attention which particularly disquiets TT proponents and alternative-medicine advocates, for it brings to light not only the good science of Emily's experiment, but also the contrast which it makes with the paucity of fundamental and unequivocal evidence for TT. That leads to the lesson that medicine should take away from the Emily Event: don't ignore this stuff. The only way for quackery to succeed is for good scientists to do nothing. Don't just attack it \u2014 refute it. True, it's a Herculean task (there are an infinity of ways for people to be wrong), and not everyone is suited to do it, but someone must. The medical importance of the Emily Event rests with the change that may come about as a result. The most obvious and measurable change will be in the teaching and practice of TT. Noting the public visceral reaction to the scientific disproof of TT should cause deans of nursing to take a second look at their curricula and weed out TT or analogous kinds of programs. At the very least, TT should be relegated to the \"research\" back rooms of nursing academia, which it never should have left in the first place. The early results outside of academia are mixed. Quite surprisingly, a holistic clinic in Rhode Island quietly dropped TT from its offerings because of the results of Emily's experiment. Yet there are other, mainstream hospitals, like the medical center in Kansas that announced that \"after careful consideration\" it would continue to offer TT, citing theoretical justification found in quantum physics and Florence Nightingale's \"spiritual philosophy.\" The Top 10 Objections to the Rosa Paper ... with Retorts Since the Rosa paper poses a direct threat to many with vested interests in TT, those interests have advanced specious arguments to discredit the paper and its conclusions. Below is a catalog of the top 10 objections made by TT apologists, with responses. 10 Emily's experiment was worthless because it wasn't doubleblinded. The authors are biased against TT and any experimental results reported by them must be discounted. Emily's parents put her up to this so they could destroy TT. Just how was this bias supposed to have its effect on the experimental outcomes? Yes, it is important to control for \"experimenter bias,\" but not foolishly so. You don't do it just to be doing it, there must be a reason for doing so. Critics have yet to come up with any valid reasons for double-blinding, and some of the reasons put forward by critics are more bizarre than what was being tested. (For example, that Emily could stop the spinning of a coin by holding her hand several inches above it.) Double-blinding is compellingly important in clinical tests, but much less so in other types of experimentation. Emily's controls were sufficient for the experimental situation. It was a simple binary test. Either it was the right hand or the left. Either the subject said right or left. There were no shades of meaning or correctness to influence. As for Emily's parents putting her up to this, Emily herself bristles at this as it takes away credit from her she rightfully believes is hers. Her parents acted as teachers before and during the test, and helped her analyze and understand the results afterwards. They have raised her in an environment that puts a premium on the efficacy of the scientific method (as opposed to \"other ways of knowing\"), and they make no apologies for that. Emily's mother is an RN with a professional (and legal) responsibility to report substandard practice to responsible authorities within her profession. This responsibility extended to the results of Emily's test: it would have been professionally irresponsible for her to suppress or fail to report it. 9 The statistics were flawed. In particular, the number of subjects was too few to warrant the conclusions reached by the authors. Practitioners were expected to get 100% right, which is unreasonable. The study did no such thing. Logic \"expected\" practitioners to get 100% right since they claim to be able to manipulate consistently human energy fields for patient benefit, but the statistics analyzed the results only on the basis of getting 67% or 75% right. Yet subjects failed to do better than what would be expected from mere guessing. Indeed, the original protocol declared that a practitioner would have \"passed\" the test if she got 8 out of 10. Only one did that well, and in a retest got 6 out of 10. Emily had more practitioners in her study than the vast majority of previous TT studies had patients for theirs. The study's statistics take into account the size of the sample. Thus, as reported in the paper, if TT practitioners had the ability to feel an energy field with their hands at least two out of every three times they try, the probability of missing it with Emily's test (even with only 21 practitioners) was less than 1 out of 20. If they had the ability to detect the field at least 3 times out of 4, then the chance of missing it with Emily's test was only 3 out 10,000. 8 The practitioners were not validly screened as being truly \"representative\" of TT. In fact, one even reported being a practitioner for longer than TT has been around. As to being unrepresentative, in what way? All claimed an ability beforehand, all reported at least one year of experience with TT, and one had even published on TT and appeared in a teaching video. There is no \"certification\" process for TT practitioners, so it is not possible in testing to do anything but take their statements about their abilities at face value. In fact that was the reason why the allegedly anomalous \"length of practice\" was reported for one practitioner \u2014 it was the number of years stated by the practitioner herself. Assuming honesty on her part, it was likely she was reporting that she had been performing something like TT for that length of time. One point is clear after Emily's test: from now on, reference to a \"qualified TT practitioner\" must be to one who can demonstrably and objectively detect a patient's human energy field. We know of no one so qualified. 7 Emily's field was probably all wrong for this test. She either had (a) cold or bioenergetically dead hands; (b) a wild pubescent field; (c) too perfect a field (or too healthy); (d) a field with too short a range; (e) a field so large it encompassed both hands of a subject; or (f) suppressed or misdirected her field to fool her subjects (either consciously or unconsciously). In the second go-round, subjects were allowed to first \"feel\" the energy field around their hands and pick a hand for her to use in the subsequent test. If they couldn't feel anything at all at that point, why didn't they say something? Nothing in the previous literature on TT suggests significant obstacles or limitations to the practice of TT. With this notion, the \"TT Self-Assessment\" procedure (where nurses familiarize themselves by feeling the energy field between their own hands) could never work. Also, in TT originator Dolores Krieger's book she talks about her own \"Emperor's Clothes\" test where you can tell the difference when a shoulder is covered with plastic and when it is not; no warning is given that this test is invalid if the shoulder is healthy (not to mention the state of the practitioner). Also, Krieger claims to feel the energy fields of apparently normal seeds, rivers, rocks, etc. (and to tell the difference between them). As for redirecting her energy, it should be remembered that Emily was performing the role of a patient in this experiment. It has long been maintained that the beliefs and attitudes of patients (i.e., the people whose fields practitioners feel) have no bearing on the effectiveness of TT practice. This argument also belies the need for double-blinding. Regardless of who was holding out the \"target\" hand, this argument could always be used to call the target into question. With such obviously contradictory explanations or rationalizations, the point is made for the necessity for fundamental testing, such as Emily's. It should be noted that each of these reasons, if accepted, would lead to a fundamental untestability of the HEF premise. A failure could always be explained away. 6 This was not a test of TT, but a parlor game. What the practitioners were required to do during the experiment invalidated its applicability to TT, especially since TT is a holistic process and can't be validly analyzed in parts. Emily's test was not of efficacy or technique (or \"healing\"), but of raw ability. It's very much like testing a surgeon to see if he can tell, without looking, in which hand the scalpel is being held. In any event, there was some movement. Emily presented her hand after each coin flip, which required relative movement between her hands and the subject's. Both subjects and Emily had at least small movements of their hands during the trials, and some practitioners even wiggled their fingers or hands. Previous descriptions of the sensations of feeling an HEF state that the field itself is constantly in motion, and the literature states that such motion can be easily felt. Significantly, all of Emily's subjects agreed to the protocol and none voiced any concern that the test setup would pose a problem in demonstrating their ability. The argument about TT being \"holistic\" is a thinly disguised attempt to get back to \"outcome\" (i.e., clinical) testing, where it is easier to obfuscate, ignore negative results, or explain away nonconforming data. There have been numerous clinical trials on outcomes using TT. The results are highly mixed. Some tests do not have statistically significant results, others revealed slight positive effects (though statistically significant), and several actually reported statistically significant effects, but negative (i.e., the control group did better than the TT group). Holistic practitioners' prejudice against what they call \"reductionism\" (analyzing things in parts) is not shared by others in scientific medicine. 5 The conclusions reached by the authors were illogical and outrageous. Nobody ever said that feeling a human energy field was necessary to practice TT, and in fact one doesn't need to. TT theorists have said so \u2014 consistently. Some \"energy workers\" now say they do not have to feel the field to be effective, but for 25 years TT practitioners undeniably have claimed to feel the HEF and to assess and manipulate it. It is the raison d'\u00eatre of TT (as applied energy work). A quarter-century of conducting clinical studies and book writing by TT advocates makes it clear that (until this experiment came along) detecting the energy field was an indispensable part of TT practice. 4 It doesn't matter how TT works. Even if it's only a placebo, what's the harm? TT is too valuable not to be used. How do they know it works or is truly valuable? By anecdotal evidence and \"other ways of knowing\" (e.g., wishful thinking, whim, insights through meditation, \"grounded theory\", magic, etc.)? Sorry, science requires much more. But for the sake of argument, suppose that TT works only as placebo. How could it be ethically practiced non-experimentally on real patients? The practitioner needs to deceive the patient as to the efficacy and the mechanism of treatment (knowing full well it is only placebo). Deceit is never ethical, even with good intentions. Perhaps TT practitioners and others who argue this point are believers in the-ends-justify-the-means. Fortunately for the rest of us, responsible medical practitioners believe otherwise. Science requires much more. 3 Publication of this was a travesty. It was an insult to qualified, hard-working, grownup nurse researchers. Why? Because it was done by a kid? What is the minimum age for thinking scientifically? A panel of 15 JAMA editors passed this on for publication. They were highly mindful that if this particular study didn't pass muster, the journal's reputation would suffer. Had they suppressed it for non-scientific reasons, they would have been guilty of ignoring facts. JAMA editor George Lundberg put it well: \"Age doesn't matter. All we care about is good science. This was good science.\" Some of these \"qualified, hard-working grownups\" are not without reason for feeling threatened. Publication of Emily's experiment is embarrassing to those with Ph.D.'s or DNS's doing \"research\" in this area, many of whom actually owe their degrees to TT. It is also embarrassing to all of nursing for letting them get away with it for so long. If their research was so good, so undeniable, so revolutionary, why weren't their theories recognized by other scientific fields long before Emily was even born? 2 JAMA published this because simple, inexpensive remedies like TT threaten the economic interests of doctors and pharmaceutical companies. They won't publish research on things that will save consumers money. In truth, most papers on alternative medicine received by major (mainstream) journals are hopelessly poor in quality. Reading those papers that are published in the lesser journals confirms this. And, of course, there is the question of whether there is anything scientifically valid to report favorably about any alternative practice. To accept the conspiratorial premise on which this argument is based, one needs to accept also that the conspiracy is not only vast, but is ubiquitous. One has to accept that there is absolutely no one of integrity at the top of the medical professions. And one must accept also that the practicing professionals are so completely impotent, ignorant, or uncaring that they are all unable even to detect the conspiracy, much less fight it to get what is right for their patients. 1 TT works, Emily or no Emily. Let's talk about something else. And supposedly open minds slam shut. Next time the statement is made that \"skeptics are closed-minded,\" remember the Emily Event and consider whose minds were actually closed to evidence. Skeptic Know Thyself Skeptics have a chance to see if immense and favorable public opinion can achieve the modest goal of rooting out of nursing an obvious and scientifically disproved wackiness. If not, then perhaps it can be fairly said that skepticism is a toothless watchdog. But if change does come, then the cause of rational thinking and the tactic of exposing nonsense to public scrutiny are vindicated and a pattern is set for tackling future targets. Skeptics now need to mobilize and press home the advantage on TT.

Given the fact that Jerry Brown was Governor of California for two terms, ran for Senate in 1982 (where he lost to California Governor Pete Wilson), and ran for President twice (even giving Bill Clinton a run for his money), there are few people more qualified by experience to speak skeptically about American politics. With the mid-term elections still fresh on our minds, enjoy this candid and skeptical look into the inner workings of a modern democracy. We the People? Jerry Brown on Money, Politics, and Who Really Runs America an interview by Frank Miele Edmund G. \"Jerry\" Brown, Jr. has spent much of his life about as deeply \"Inside Politics\" and as much a part of modern American history as you can. His father, Edmund G. \"Pat\" Brown, Sr. was a popular Democratic Governor of California. Pat Brown won reelection against (then) former Vice President Richard Nixon, causing the latter to issue his never-to-be forgotten, but not honored, line, \"You won't have Dick Nixon to kick around anymore.\" He lost his bid for a third term to Republican Ronald Reagan. Jerry Brown himself served two terms as governor of the nation's most populous state. He lost a 1982 bid for the U.S. Senate seat to (current) California Governor Pete Wilson. In 1994 Jerry's sister, Kathleen, then California's Treasurer, unsuccessfully challenged Pete Wilson for re-election to the governor's office. Jerry Brown ran against Jimmy Carter for the Democratic nomination for President of the United States in 1976 (winning Maryland, Rhode Island, Nevada, and California) and ever so briefly in 1980. In 1992 he ran a guerrilla campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination, introducing the now trademarked 800-number. With his knowledge of the inside game of politics, Brown was able to stay in the race until the bitter end (capturing Maine, Vermont, Colorado and Nevada), eventually losing to Bill Clinton. Brown also served as the chairman of the Democratic Party in California 1989-91. Jerry Brown has never fit into the conventional politician's mold. He studied for 3 1/2 years for the priesthood and also went to India to work with Mother Teresa. To his critics and opponents, he was \"Governor Moonbeam\" because of his support for the California Space Satellite program and his encouragement of alternative energy sources. But his refusal to conform has also been his strength and his appeal to millions of voters across the nation. He not only knows the inside game, he also calls 'em as he sees 'em. Brown now heads WE THE PEOPLE, a non-profit, public interest group located in an industrial section of Oakland, CA, in post-industrial cyberspace at [ www.wtp.org ](http://www.wtp.org/) and toll free at 1-800-426-1112. His WE THE PEOPLE call-in radio program is carried on listener-sponsored Pacifica radio stations across the U.S. WE THE PEOPLE has organized a school for sustainability, a public interest law project, and a continuing series of community forums. Brown has also brought together political activists to discuss, imagine and plan ways to increase citizen activism. So, for a skeptical look at the democratic process in contemporary America, here is Jerry Brown \u2014 a politician out of denial and into recovery \u2014 on money, politics, and who really runs America. Skeptic: I got my introduction to politics when I was a high school student passing out flyers. At the time, I thought what I was doing really mattered. Then local boss told me, \"Kid, elections are won by money and votes, in that order!\" Was he right? Brown: Sure he was right. Money pays for the tasks in politics. These include everything from producing and showing TV commercials to hiring individuals to work in the community as pseudo-grass-roots leaders, organizers, and neighborhood activists. Without the money, the modern American political machine grinds to a halt. We don't have active participation, we have spectatorship. Turnout is down to just above 50% for the presidential election, more like 33% for an off-year congressional election, and even lower in many local elections. So what we have is a theory of democracy, a mythology of citizen power, of \"We the People.\" But the reality is the manipulation of the people through sophisticated computer-generated letters, TV ads, or what is called astro-turf organizing efforts. Astro-turf is a metaphor for organized person-to-person activity that many campaigns engage in, either by phone or less frequently door-to-door. But all of it is paid for and organized professionally. This is in complete distinction to a system of real volunteers flocking behind the banner and platform of a candidate and then going out to help get him or her elected. Skeptic: Was that grass-roots, rather than astro-turf, style of politics ever the case in America history? Brown: American history certainly started out with the political process being a monopoly of white male property owners. It then broadened under the Jacksonian reforms to include more people. Then the Big City bosses introduced the trading of jobs for votes and \"taking care of people\" and the corruption that came with them. In the South they had Plantation Politics, Jim Crow Laws, and a whites-only single party politics. American political history is a real mixed bag. We can't look to the past with rose-tinted glasses. Yet there was popular mobilization. Not in the 1920s when the Democratic candidates were more conservative than the Republicans. But with the Depression, FDR and the rejuvenation of the labor movement, there was real activism. Something was at stake \u2014 jobs, unemployment insurance, CCC [Civilian Conservation Corps]. There were real tangible rewards for political participation for ordinary folks, including poor people. Today the rewards are principally for the wealthy, the corporate representatives, what some would call the elite. And their participation is close to 100%. Skeptic: The counter argument is that many people don't vote because it really doesn't matter. It takes a depression to generate that level of interest and participation. But those circumstances can also throw up revolutions of either the right or the left. Maybe the beauty of America is that we're not overpoliticized or polarized. Brown: No. That might have been true in the past. But prior to the 20th century there were turnouts of 75% to 80%. That was before women and African-Americans were allowed to vote. What you have now is the increasing manipulation of the people by the elite based on fear \u2014 fear of crime, of terrorism, and before that, of communism. We have the development of a garrison state and an invasive central power. Ironically this is often fostered by Republicans as well as Democrats under the rhetoric of \"less government.\" But the power of the government is getting greater and greater because it acquires newer technology and more money. The non-participation of the people is really a misconception. The people are participating by their acquiescence. Consciously or not, they are being manipulated into demanding more and more police, surveillance, and incarceration, and the channeling of more money into the military and the corporate control of the economy. This is gradually diminishing the power of people, the strength of communities, the integrity of families and neighborhoods. We're getting an almost ocean-to-ocean homogenized mass consumption culture that is kept in line by corporate advertising on the one hand and the police surveillance and incarceration of the few percent that can't fit in on the other. Skeptic: We're all familiar with the flowchart in our high school civics book, \"How a Bill Becomes a Law.\" Now tell us how it really works. Brown: The way it really works is that a lobbyist for some interest group \u2014 a trucking interest, sanitation interest, a union, a bank, or a savings and loan \u2014 will go to a legislator. If they're in the game, they'll know which legislator to go to and they'll get a bill introduced. The interest group and its lobbyists will provide the language of the bill to the legislator. In California, the legislator will then have it written into the proper legislative language by the legislative council, a set of central staffers that serve the entire legislature. The bill then gets a number, and is ready to be reviewed by the various interest groups. There as also public interest groups such as environmentalists, civil libertarians, and consumer advocates that push bills. And their bills are reviewed and often opposed by corporate groups that don't want their business constrained. But the real discussion goes on behind closed doors. It involves the contest of economic pressures and political forces. The public hearings are mostly for show. They serve to get publicity and to make the interest groups feel good. Skeptic: How much of what we see of our legislatures on CSPAN and public access TV stations is for real and how much is professional wrestling? Brown: Well, it's professional wrestling in the sense that a lot of hearings take place just so the lobbyists can bring in their clients. It allows them to make a record, to put on a show, and to set out a marker so their boss will think they're doing their job. If it's a broad-based organization, they can send out a newsletter with a picture of all their experts testifying before Congress. It's all kept in the massive Congressional Record. The whole thing is about making news and looking good. But the real work goes on privately, at the staff level particularly, and sometimes among the more experienced legislators. But the key thing the legislators want to know is, \"What do the interest groups think?\" There are hundreds of these key interest groups. And they have to be satisfied. The word that we heard at the state capitol in Sacramento (CA) was, \"the legislator is the horse and you have to deal with the jockey!\" The jockey is the interest group. That's where the power is. The necessary deals are cut. And they're based on how they will get their guy elected, what will please the people in his or her district, usually the powerful people. That's not to say that a people's group can't have an impact. It can. But by and large, bills like the recent Telecommunications Bill are almost solely determined by the competing forces. Now, some people will say, \"Well, it's AT&T versus the Baby Bells versus the cable companies, and that's democracy!\" No! It's competition among elite, unrepresentative power groups to carve up the public power of America for their own interest. That is not democratic in any sense. Skeptic: If I'm a legislator why should I go along with these interests? Brown: Because they provide the money for your campaigns. The corporations can also define the business climate or how it's perceived. They are the powers-that-be. And if you become their enemy, you're viewed as an odd ball, as ineffective. You don't get re-elected. The PACs [Political Action Committees] provide an enormous sum of money. When the Democrats were in power, 50% of their money came from PACs. PACs deal with laws. That's why they give money \u2014 to influence legislation. If you're not part of that game, you're not there. And since you are there, you're part of the game. There are no exceptions. Skeptic: What about the First Law of Politics, to wit, \"If you can't eat their food, drink their booze, screw their women, take their money, and then vote against them, you've got no business being here\"? Brown: That quote came from former California Assembly Speaker Jesse Unruh (aka \"Big Daddy\"). It's another example of the way that politicians deceive themselves as well as their constituents, if in fact they do deceive themselves. The fact of the matter is that if day in and day out you take special interest money, you do what they want. Now on any given bill, if there's heat, if there's public scrutiny, you're not going to be obvious about having been bought off. You have to keep that covered. But in fact you are bought off. The entire system is bought off by the institutional bias created by special interest campaign spending. Skeptic: Who are the biggest contributors to the Republicans and the Democrats, nationally and here in California? Brown: In each state it is a little different. Obvious examples come to mind. The truckers, the medical industry, the tobacco industry, some of the unions are big contributors. Skeptic: Do they give to both sides? Brown: A lot of them do; some don't. Teachers and unions generally give to Democrats, oil companies and truckers are more Republican-oriented. Skeptic: Perhaps you can define some of these \"inside baseball\" terms \u2014 what do they mean and why are they important: Soft Money. Brown: Soft money is corporate or union, as opposed to individual, donations to a political campaign. In many states, there's no legal limit on soft money. Legally it is not allowed in federal campaigns. It can only be used for voter registration, party building, and state campaigns. But it can funnel back into campaigns. Skeptic: Vote Suppression. Brown: When you engage in mudslinging you can lower the voter turnout and the reduction in voter participation is skewed against the poor. Inclination to vote is strongest among the most educated and the most affluent. As you go down the income and education scale, you find lower rates of participation. Skeptic: Walking Around Money. Brown: That's money that you give to get people to go out and vote on election day. Today it's principally in the poor neighborhoods of large Eastern cities. Skeptic: Losers always like to claim the other side only won because they had more money. But if you're interested in domestic or foreign policy, if you're a group that has been the victim of government policies in the past, shouldn't you contribute to the process? What's wrong with that? Isn't that simply playing by the rules and playing smart? Brown: What's wrong with it is that it offends common-law notions of bribery, which proscribe the giving or receipt of money or anything of value, where the intent is to influence official behavior. That pretty well describes campaign contributions, particularly PAC donations. What's wrong is that the money exchange is inherently corrupting. It separates the process from ordinary people. As the central government takes on more power and as advanced technology makes things more complicated, the only ones with the time and the expertise to become active are the paid people. And increasingly they represent the corporate view of unlimited free trade, homogenization of all communities, the disruption of the neighborhood and the family in the service of neutered efficiency. Credit, consumption, global production, massive incarceration, massive propaganda, and a general anxiety are the products of the modern, market economy. It is making it virtually impossible to come to terms with the environmental crisis which threatens countless species, and human life itself. Skeptic: Or are contributors in many cases just playing safe? To what extent are political contributions a subtle form of paying protection? If Skeptic magazine were in a position to make big contributions (unfortunately, we're not) and there were a Gullible magazine, wouldn't Gullible have to contribute just to \"cover their ass\" so Congress didn't pass a bunch of pro-Skeptic legislation? Brown: Well, buying protection is buying influence. You have to be in the game. If the Baby Bells don't pay to play, then AT&T or the cable companies will come into their market and they'll lose out. The government has power and it auctions it off in a sophisticated way. The skill of being a member of Congress is knowing how to play in that auction. And then it's knowing how to take the money that comes from the auction and use it to get re-elected. That takes no brains at all because you hire a professional. You could be a dog and get elected, because most people don't see their congressman. In the modern, anonymous, urban areas, it's merely a mailer, a computerized pamphlet, brochure, book, or letter, and in some cases TV ads. But the face-to-face town meeting has long gone the way of the dodo bird. Skeptic: Let me see if I can interest you in a deal. You be the liberal Democrat, I'll be the conservative Republican. I'll scare the hell out of businesses by saying that you're going to raise taxes, and you scare the hell out of the unions by saying that I'm going to reduce their benefits. Don't you and I have jobs for the rest of our lives where we don't really have to work? Isn't this a little like professional wrestling? Brown: Right. That's what it is. It's a game. There are turf battles, however. There's the Praetorian Guard that has to be fed. And then there are the congressmen and their staffs. And then there are the reporters who report on them. It's becoming a semi-autonomous court, maybe like the court of Louis XIV or the Tsars of Russia. They throw a few bones to the people. They scare them with the hobgoblins of terrorism and underclass criminals. All of this is highly exaggerated. Much of it is created by the very corporate allocation of jobs and income, which then creates the dislocation and breakdown of the family, crime, and child abuse. All this generates the fear that keeps the same power mongers going in their decadent game of democracy abuse. Skeptic: Now go back in time and put on your old hat as a working politico. I want to run for Governor of California. I'm hiring you as my consultant. How much will it cost? Brown: It depends. Are you known or unknown? If you're known, you need a lot less. When I ran in the late 70s it took a couple million. My sister ran in 1994 and spent $22 million and lost. But you could do it on a lot less. Skeptic: Where does the money go? Brown: It goes to television. Your opponent is going to say that \"You are a dog molester.\" Then you have to put on ads saying, \"No, my opponent is a cat molester.\" And it goes back and forth. If you're not, as they say, \"up on television,\" people will ask, \"Where are you? Have you dropped out?\" You could be running around the state campaigning 10 hours a day. You have an electorate of 14 million in California. You can't reach that many people face-to-face in a hundred lifetimes. You can only do it through the corporate media. And they charge as much as $30,000 per minute for a prime time ad in a major media market. So you're talking about a million dollars a week to play in the game. Can you do that for $7 or $8 million? I think you could if you had a good campaign. You could do it for less if you had a real popular movement. Skeptic: Do you, as the consultant, get commissions or rebates (i.e., kickbacks) on media buys and mailers? Brown: You can get it on all of them. It all depends on what deal you cut or take. Today it's much more \"professional.\" The consultants commission everything from the art work to the postage. They're clever people. Consultants can be strategists or they can act as general contractors who haul in subcontractors. But it's simple, straightforward stuff. You take a random sample and do a telephone poll. Then you produce your TV ads. Hollywood is crawling with film makers who want to sell their services. It's a simple business. Some people have the knack for the game, just like some people can play football. Skeptic: OK, I'm running as the Skeptical candidate. I'm skeptical that capital punishment really deters potential murderers, that increased school spending actually better educates students, that commuter lanes actually reduce pollution. My skepticism is such that I don't think government ought to do anything unless there's a clear and present danger if they don't, and only after they have considered the unintended adverse effects of their policies. Do I stand a chance? Brown: No. The whole government is part of the big corporate global economy. Without government policing everything from trademarks to highway congestion to pollution, the whole system will break down. If you just leave it to the corporations, everything will grind to a halt. Under the present system someone has to protect the property, the investments, the border. All that is managed by the government-corporate-media system. Skeptic: Well, couldn't you then at least whittle it down to just the cops and military? Brown: Only if you whittle down the corporations. If you go back to the village, you could. But when you operate a global economy, bringing in tens of billions of dollars of merchandise from China, somebody's got to keep all that straight. Who is going to police the people in China who copy CDs? That takes government. If you don't police them, they'll be selling them here in the U.S. We are ground into a world where the state is the integral element of the modern economy. Skeptic: Would the public go for my platform, regardless of whether it's practical? Brown: No, because without government you wouldn't have Social Security. People would die of food poisoning at some fast food joint. People want an answer. \"If there's a problem, let's have a solution.\" That is the media background music. If there's child abuse, then thousands of people are arrested and millions are fingerprinted. It doesn't matter that a few years later half of them have to be let out because they weren't guilty. The war on drugs requires spending money in Mexico, Peru, Panama, and Colombia. And the money often goes to some of the same people working with the drug dealers to get the drugs in here. The system is running out of control. It's big, it's hard to watch, and a lot of people would like to go back to simpler days. But they do like going to the mall and loading up their car with all the stuff. We live in an age of guilt-free consumption. Skeptic: How about requiring TV (since that's where most of the money goes) and radio stations, which have to be licensed to serve the public interest, to provide substantial free time to qualified candidates to use as they please? Brown: That's fine. I proposed that 20 years ago to the FCC. They never answered me, to this day, though some of the networks are now talking about it. You could create a public forum through television where we could have a vital, democratic process. But real reform will require more than just new rules for TV stations. It will require a change in attitudes that will produce a change in the structure of government. The financial incentive, which is the heart of capitalism, is now turning into an out-of-control engine that is destroying everything from the family to democracy to human freedom. Skeptic: Originally, our legislatures met for only a small amount of time. They would then go home and lead a real life. We live in the age of high tech \u2014 internet, teleconferencing, telecommuting. Why do legislators have to be physically present to participate in debate and to vote? Why couldn't they be given the option to do both remotely from their home office? This would allow voters in the district to see their representative far more frequently and make it much harder for a lobbyist to work all of them in one day. Why don't we use technology in government more? Brown: First, there is a fear of technology. Second, the players want to get together to establish their relationships, the mafia brotherhood. And they want to deal with the lobbyists to raise the money. They want to play in the game. The myth is the power of Washington, the power of the state capitol. That is the symbol that there is a deliberative process, a representative mechanism. When politicians meet in official chambers it creates a ritual of government. Why do people have to go to church? The government is a church of a sort. The legislators voting in the Capitol is a way of ritualistically reconfirming the mythology that there is a democratic process to which the people are connected. The reality is very different. Skeptic: As skeptics, we regularly hear from individuals who have left cults or fraudulent faith healing acts, and the comeback we always get from their erstwhile fellows is, \"These are the people who have left. These are the sour grapes.\" So, why shouldn't we be skeptical of what you're saying now? Brown: Well, I said many of the same things when I was running for governor. I sponsored the Political Reform Act. If you listened to what I said at that time, it was not particularly different from what I'm saying now. But of course I didn't really follow it. Skeptic: What was the light that struck you on the road to Damascus? Brown: Getting older, seeing the breakdown of our society, the increase in the number of homeless and poor, the quadrupling of incarceration \u2014 principally of poor people and people of color. And then seeing the growth of special interest money at the same time, the increasing professionalization and manipulation of the political process. All of that is making the political enterprise more and more unacceptable, at least to me. Skeptic: From where you sit now, are you optimistic or pessimistic about the future of our republic? Brown: I would say we face grave danger. Personally, I still have a certain optimism. That's why I'm still involved. Skeptic: Thank you for taking the time to speak so candidly with Skeptic.

About this week's eSkeptic In this week's eSkeptic, we present an article from [Skeptic magazine vol. 2, no. 2](https://www.skeptic.com/magazine/archives/vol02n02.html) (1993) wherein physicist Milton Rothman examines the relationship between science and religion and the extent to which a scientist should apply his belief in realism to all aspects of our knowledge of the universe. Milton Rothman received his Ph.D. in physics after World War II. He spent several years in nuclear physics research at the Bartol Research Foundation in Swarthmore, PA, ten years in plasma physics research at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, and ten years as Professor of physics at Trenton State College. He has written some science fiction, a large number of technical papers and popular articles, and eight books. His latest book is [The Science Gap: Dispelling the Myths and Understanding the Reality of Science](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591021642?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1591021642) (Prometheus Books, 1992). Realism and Religion A Physicist Examines the Basis for Belief by Milton Rothman What should a scientist think about religion and God? Is there a relationship between belief in religion and the paranormal? Just how far should a skeptic go in challenging the belief systems of the world? Finally, what is the basis for our belief in anything? These are the fundamental questions I will address in this essay that touches on one of the most sensitive issues in skepticism \u2014 the relationship between science and religion and the extent to which the scientist should apply his belief in realism to all aspects of our knowledge of the universe. 1. Dealing Realistically with the Paranormal There are two ways of testing claims of the paranormal. By far the most popular is top-down observation: See what the psychic predicts \u2014 is this what actually happens? Look at the astrologer's horoscope \u2014 does it say anything valid about events in the real world? Analyze the results of ESP experiments and show what, if anything, is wrong with them. See if you can find physical evidence of UFOs or else explain how the claimed evidence was faked ... and so on. Theory plays a minor role. The other way is bottom-up theoretical: examine the purported paranormal phenomenon in light of general principles firmly established within modern physics. Is the claim plausible according to the standard model of particle physics, the principle of relativity, the theory of gravitation, and the rest of verified knowledge? For example, does a proposed machine require the expenditure of energy without an energy source? Then it cannot happen. Does ESP require that information travels faster than the speed of light? Then it cannot happen. Does a UFO defy gravity and hang suspended high in the air with no visible means of support? Then it cannot happen. These are not arbitrary or a priori judgements. The experiments that establish the general laws have already been done. You do not have to repeat the experiments for special cases of ESP and UFOs. General laws that apply to everything in the world also must apply to the particular cases of ESP and UFOs. (Those who object to this statement may refute it by proving the existence of objects or events in the universe that do not follow regular and general laws of nature.) The prerequisite for thinking in terms of physical laws is a framework of philosophical realism. All actual events in nature are described by realistic theories. (For a definition of realism see [Section 2](#section2).) By contrast, theories concerning paranormal phenomena almost invariably are associated with the world view of philosophical idealism. Idealists believe that ideas are more important than physical evidence. If an idealist believes that something exists, then that is the same as knowing it exists. The thought is father to the fact, rather than the other way around. An extreme Platonist might believe that a chair is merely a hypothetical entity, but his belief in supernatural forces represents truth. I do not wish to diminish the importance of ideas. To a realist, however, if an idea is to be of use, it must be an idea about something that actually exists. Since \"beauty\" is a mental construct that refers to something we all experience, the idea of beauty is a valid one. The idea of psychic energy, however, refers to something that has never been observed and, moreover, produces no observable effects. (This is not to be confused with a belief in psychic energy, which may produce observable effects.) We find, then, that when events are governed by idealistic (as opposed to realistic) theories, they invariably turn out to be mental constructs involving unreal entities and forces such as psychic energy, spiritual energy, an incorporeal \"mind,\" \"vibrations,\" antigravity, the ether, supernatural beings, and the like. Whoever claims the reality of imaginary and nonexistent things is operating in an idealistic framework. His idea or belief takes precedence over the existence (or non-existence) of physical evidence. In view of these observations it appears to me that those innately skeptical toward claims of the paranormal operate from a realistic philosophy, while those who tend to believe in the paranormal use a reference frame that is idealistic in nature. This dichotomy generally characterizes the distinction between normal and paranormal, skeptic and believer. It is not my aim to rehash the history of science and elaborate on the many conflicts that have arisen between realists and idealists. My position is that now, at the end of the twentieth century, the conflicts have been resolved in favor of realism, especially in the realm of things that happen at the macroscopic, human level. The idealists continue to mount a rear guard action in the microscopic domain, particularly in the area of quantum physics, but it is a vain effort. Many have written on this topic elsewhere, notably Bunge, 1967, 1993; Herbert, 1985; Popper, 1967; and Bell, 1987. Some of the arguments I make below have already appeared in prior work (Rothman, 1988, 1992). 2. Realism and Idealism Realism is the idea that the things that exist in the world have an objective existence; they are there whether or not humans observe them. Furthermore, these objects are made of particles subject to physical laws that govern their properties and behaviors. These laws result from the structure of the universe; they do not depend on human desires or intentions. Neither do they depend on the will of supernatural beings. As an illustration of how nature does not care about what humans think, consider that there are at least eleven ways of writing equations describing the motion of a baseball or a planet. (Hamilton's equations, Lagrange's equations, Maupertuis' law of least action, etc.) These equations are all equivalent to Newton's second law of motion, but each is different in structure from the others. However, there is only one reality that these several equations describe. Idealism, on the other hand, supposes that the human mind has some say about the way the world is. The foundation of idealism is the notion that \"mind\" is something that exists independently of the body. While mind-body dualism has been abandoned by all neuroscientists, it is still part of the idealist philosophy. The extreme idealist thinks that the outside world exists because the inside world of his mind creates the outside world. Theories of idealism less extreme admit to the existence of the universe, but hold that our ideas about reality are no more than opinions created in the mind, or that the nature of the things in the world is somehow influenced by what we think about them. This is the Platonic view. (The very fact that there are so many theories of idealism contesting for acceptance implies that idealism itself is an unverifiable opinion.) A saying, popular in some circles, is: \"Nothing exists until it is observed.\" If you believe this notion then it makes sense to ask the hoary question, \"If a tree falls in the forest, and there is nobody there to hear it, does it make a sound?\" To a physicist this is a non-problem. The question is answered simply by defining what we mean by a sound: It is a vibration in the air or other medium. A person with idealistic tendencies will say that the sound does not exist unless somebody hears it. Most working scientists who take the time to think about it adopt the viewpoint that realism is the only rational basis for a science. Yet some scientists make statements that are remarkably idealistic in nature. This is particularly true in the context of quantum mechanics, and a number of popular books have appeared during the past two decades whose sole effect has been to mislead and confuse the public. These books have to do with the nature of elementary particles as described by quantum mechanics. In quantum theory the location of an electron or photon is undefined until it is detected, and some properties of the particle (such as spin or direction of polarization) are in part determined by the state of the detector set up to observe the particle. This baffling phenomenon has given rise to the common \u2014 and misguided \u2014 belief that the particle does not exist until it is observed. Saying that a particle does not exist until it is observed is quite different from the legitimate statement that the observed properties of the object depend to some extent on the nature of the observation. It is something like my state of mind in listening to music. If I turn on the radio early in the morning and the station happens to be broadcasting a commercial containing loud rock-and-roll, I will complain bitterly about how raucous this is, and rush to shut it off. But, at night, if I have had a drink and am in the mood for dancing, then the same music is quite acceptable. \"Beauty\" and \"ugly\" depend on the state of the observer. But the music itself, as defined by the vibrations in the air, has not changed. Exemplifying the idealist scientist, the physicist Werner Heisenberg has been quoted as saying \"The idea of an objective real world whose smallest parts exist objectively in the same sense as stones or trees exist, independently of whether or not we observe them ... is impossible.\" John Gribben writes \"Nothing is real unless we look at it, and it ceases to be real as soon as we stop looking.\" (Gribben, 1984, p. 173) In spite of comments such as these, the realistic point of view is supported by a number of observations: A. While certain properties of a particle (such as spin and polarization) are contingent on the way the observation is made, their fundamental properties, such as rest mass and electric charge, are intrinsic and do not depend on how they are measured or who does the measurement. A glance at a table of fundamental constants, such as is found in the [Handbook of Chemistry and Physics](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1439820775?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1439820775), lists the electron charge, the electron mass, the proton mass, and many other physical quantities to a very large number of significant digits. These quantities are not invented or made up: they are the results of numerous measurements and are objective, intrinsic properties of real physical objects. (Indeed, a particle is defined by the totality of its fundamental properties: an electron is a particle with a certain mass, electric charge, and spin. A particle with a different mass, charge, and spin is a different particle.) B. The speed of light has been measured by many people all around the world. Everybody gets the same number within the limits of error \u2014 and the limits of error in recent years have become exceedingly small. There is no way this could happen if the speed of light was determined by the person measuring it. The same is true for all the other fundamental constants. The fact that everybody gets the same number when measuring these quantities is proof that the measurements represent the properties of real objects with objective existence. C. Saying that an object does not exist until it is observed leads to a logical fallacy \u2014 a reductio ad absurdum. First let us define \"observed.\" In physics, a particle is observed when it is detected \u2014 that is, when it deposits its energy in an appropriate instrument or nerve cell. Idealists, on the other hand, tell us that observation only takes place when the observer is conscious of the observation. Now, suppose that I am looking at a distant star. In common parlance it can be said that I am observing the star. To the idealist it follows that the star does not exist until it comes into my consciousness. But this conclusion is the result of semantic slippage. It must be understood that I am not directly observing the star with my eye. Rather, I am detecting photons which were emitted by the star a long time ago and which, after traveling many light-years, enter my eye. The physical detection takes place in the retina of the eye, where the photons vanish, giving up their energy to a number of electrons in retinal cells by means of the photoelectric effect. These electrons initiate an electrochemical impulse that travels through the optic nerve into my brain. Finally, then, I become aware of the impact of the original photons. I do not become conscious of the photon detection until after the signals have been processed by the visual center of the brain. This does not occur until several milliseconds after the initial detection of the photons. Do the photons not exist until I am conscious of their detection? If you hold to the idealist stance and insist on that interpretation, then you are saying that a non-existent object produced a signal in my retina, and only with subsequent consciousness did it become existent. Or to put it another way, the photons were detected in the retina before they existed. This is a reductio ad absurdum. D. The realistic view is that a particle detector can be totally inanimate; consciousness is not required for particle detection. Consider the detection of particles by a scintillation counter that sends signals into a computer. The computer adds up all the counts and stores them in the memory. A human may or may not look at the stored numbers. He may look at them days or years after the initial detection. Do we say that the particles do not exist until they stimulate the consciousness of a human being? Physically, this is an absurd statement, for it implies that the counters were triggered by a nonexistent particle. In reality the particles exist whether or not they are detected. The detection process merely tells us where they have come to rest and the computer counts how many particles were detected. The computer, in turn, may trigger other mechanisms; e.g., an alarm may ring if the particles are detected faster than a preset rate. The final effect does not depend on the presence of humans. (Absurdities proliferate without end once you start thinking that particles do not exist until they are detected. Think of a particle accelerator shooting high energy electrons at a target to produce nuclear reactions. Is it accelerating non-existent electrons producing reactions that do not exist until their products hit the detector?) E. The major controversies concerning realism center on \"quantum strangeness\" \u2014 a phenomenon associated with the famous Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paper of 1935 (Einstein, 1935). These phenomena all have to do with particles (electrons, photons) traveling in opposite directions, but effectively connected or correlated in some manner. For example, if an atom emits two photons by an orbital electron dropping two levels in cascade, these two photons will go off in opposite directions and will have identical polarizations. They are now detected in coincidence by distant detectors (A and B) polarized in the same direction. If the polarization of one detector is suddenly changed while the photons are in mid-flight, this will change the number of photons counted simultaneously in both detectors. It is as though detector A instantly knows what is happening at far away detector B. This \"spooky\" action at a distance is what arouses all the mystical theories of the idealists, who assume immediately that this kind of connectedness between the two photons should make it possible to send messages at speeds faster than light and perhaps provides a mechanism for ESP. However, a close examination of the experiments shows that in reality nothing about them allows information to be sent from one location to another faster than the speed of light. (Rothman, 1988, p. 83, 1992, p. 85; Bell, 1987, p. 60; Chiao, Kwiat, & Steinberg, 1993.) Thus, as far as events at the human level are concerned, the rules of realism still apply. 3. The Nature of Realism Realism and idealism are philosophies \u2014 points of view. As such, they can be neither proved nor disproved. They may be looked on as fundamental postulates. However, individual realistic or idealistic theories may or may not be falsifiable and verifiable. All realistic theories are falsifiable (by definition) and thus are legitimate empirical theories, testable by experiment. A theory that cannot be, in principle, falsified cannot be a realistic theory. The majority of idealistic theories are not falsifiable, and so are not empirical theories. In particular, theories based on religion (such as creationism) are unfalsifiable. As an example, suppose you object to creationism on the grounds that the fossil record (dated by radioactivity) shows that animals lived on earth millions of years ago. The creationist replies by saying God changed the decay rates of the radioactive isotopes about 8,000 years ago so that it merely appears as though the fossil is millions of years old. In actuality, the creationists say, God put the fossils there less than 10,000 years ago, for reasons known only to the creator. Whatever evidence you bring up to falsify the theory, the creationists claim God planted it there for His own mysterious purposes. These shifting and changeable ad-hoc assumptions make it possible to prove anything you want and so make creationism an unfalsifiable theory. The same method is used by ESP experimenters when they claim that the presence of skeptics in the same room as the experiment causes the results to be negative. The theory is rigged so that it is unfalsifiable. Perhaps the major reason for rejecting idealistic theories is that they invariably involve entities such as an incorporeal \"mind\" (separate from body), which cannot be detected by any physical means, and whose properties are subjective (that is, invented) so that there is no way of measuring them in any objective manner. Unmeasurable and undetectable entities such as phlogiston, caloric, and the ether have long vanished from the scientific vocabulary. Realistic theories, on the other hand, always involve things whose properties can be measured by objective, physical instruments. Realists start with one major assumption: there is but one reality, and the job of scientists is to determine its nature. Devotees of the Rashomon effect (according to which several people see the same event but each tells a different story) like to explain it by saying: \"Each person sees his or her own reality.\" However, this is but a metaphor. In actuality each person sees his own interpretation of reality, colored by his own preconceptions. This is quite a different matter. There is only one reality; only one event took place. Over the past century scientists have learned a great deal about the nature of reality. Physicists, in certain areas, are closing in on a complete picture, at least on a fundamental level. Neuroscientists, investigating the nature of consciousness, are far from the end, but feel they are on the right track when they confine their investigations to physical events taking place within the nervous system, visualizing the human being as a kind of computer, and avoiding imponderables such as \"psychic energy\" and mind-body dualism. In this discussion I will concentrate on physics, for this where we find the tools to test most paranormal theories for their pseudoscientific content. The part of physics that underlies all other knowledge is particle physics: the study of elementary particles and how they interact. If we know all the types of particles that exist, and if we know all the ways in which they interact, then we can predict what activities are possible and what are not possible. Particle physics does not allow us to predict all the complexities of life in the biological sphere, but it does allow us to stipulate what actions cannot possibly take place, and so it gives us a simple tool for identifying claims of the paranormal. The importance of this cannot be overestimated. One of the myths of popular culture is the claim that \"Nothing is impossible.\" Nothing can be farther from the truth. Modern physics clearly enables us to know what actions are possible and what are impossible. Particle physics as we know it now is based on the standard model of particle physics, first elaborated in the 1960s and 70s. Although this model is not complete, it has no known discrepancy with any experiment to date. Thus, any future, more complete theories of particle physics must include the standard model. Many accounts of the standard model are in print (Davies, 1984, pp. 70 & 80; Salam, 1989, p. 481; Rothman, 1992, p. 51; Weinberg, 1992, p. 58). For our purposes only a few essentials need be noted here: A. All matter consists of twelve kinds of particles, organized into three groups, or families. In fact, all matter existing under ordinary conditions \u2014 the matter that you and I come into contact with \u2014 consists of only the four particles in one family: the up quark, the down quark, the electron, and the electron-neutrino. (The familiar proton and neutron are made up of combinations of quarks.) All the actions that take place in the universe result from the four different forces that control the interactions between the twelve kinds of particles. These forces are the gravitational, electromagnetic, strong nuclear, and weak nuclear forces. B. Each of the four forces is characterized by certain symmetries in space and time. Through Noether's theorem, each symmetry is connected with a conservation law which states that a particular quantity in a system remains constant, even though everything else may be changing. For example, the force between two particles does not depend on time. (This is a symmetry, because you can set your clocks any time you like without changing the equations of motion.) Noether's theorem tells us the result of this condition: it tells us that there can be no change in the energy of the system in which these particles are interacting. Energy is the conserved quantity in this case. The consequences of the last statement are very pervasive. It means that no matter what happens, no matter how complex the system, the law of conservation of energy holds true: energy cannot be created or lost. Laws such as this are not \"just theories.\" They have been experimentally confirmed to an extraordinary degree of precision with experiments on elementary particles (Rothman, 1972, 1989, p. 101). If this law applies to the elementary particles, it applies to all things made of these particles. (Some authors refer to the First Law of Thermodynamics, which is simply a special case of conservation of energy as applied to heat engines.) Conservation of energy, together with our knowledge of the four forces, enables us to be skeptical about claims of ESP. This is because any information entering a person's brain must carry enough energy with it to activate signals in the nervous system. This information must be transmitted from one brain to another via one of the four forces. But none of the four forces will do. The nuclear forces are short-range; they cannot possibly do the job. The gravitational force is too weak. The electromagnetic force can be shielded by metal cages. ESP experimenters claim this does not matter. The electromagnetic force also loses strength with distance according to the inverse-square law. Devotees of ESP claim that distance does not matter. Therefore they must explain telepathy and teleportation by allusion to forces as yet unknown. This brings us to a crucial point often proffered by paranormalists in defense of their belief: how do we know that there are only twelve fundamental particles? How do we know that there are only four forces? How can we say that there are no other particles and forces waiting to be discovered? This is a question that could not be answered with certainty until 1989, when a new type of experiment made possible by a new generation of high-energy particle accelerators proved with a high degree of confidence that the three families of particles mentioned above are the only families of particles (Rothman, 1992, p. 59; Kinoshita, 1989, p. 22). Positive proof of this nature contradicts the folksaying common in many circles to the effect that \"it is impossible to prove a negative.\" This may be true in courts of law, but it is not true in physics. Experiments using very high energy accelerators give results that positively tell us there are no more than the three families of particle physics mentioned above. Thus, knowing the properties of these known particles, we can make definite predictions about what is possible and what is impossible. For example, if you tell the UFO believer that no real UFOs exist on this planet, he will say that you just have not looked in the right place at the right time. The realist, however, has positive proof. The realist says that if the UFO is described as traveling to earth at a speed faster than light and hovers in the air unsupported by mechanical means, then it simply cannot exist. It is not really necessary to look for evidence for or against this UFO, for faster-than-light travel does not exist, and antigravity does not exist. (All particles attract each other by the gravitational force; there is no way to arrange them so that they do anything else.) We are allowed to make statements like this because it has been established that all normal matter is made of quarks, electrons, and electron-neutrinos. Therefore anything that happens in the world must be allowed by the standard model of particle physics and by the properties of the four forces that control all the things that take place in the world. Conversely, anything not allowed by the standard model cannot happen. 4. Realists and Idealists It is my contention that realists have a tendency toward skepticism, whereas idealists have a tendency toward belief in unreal things. Realists believe that the only way they can get information about nature is through their senses. They also know that their senses can delude them, and that evidence obtained by instrumental observation is generally more reliable than the raw data pouring through the senses of an individual. The reliability of the evidence is enhanced by repeated observations and also by the ability of scientists to connect the observations into a logical structure through mathematical theory. The structure formed by the interrelatedness of verified theories is extremely rigid and hard to break. Once a scientific structure has been firmly validated, the realist doubts claims of phenomena that contradict that structure. He is a skeptic. Idealists, on the other hand, believe in the primacy of their own ideas. When told that the laws of physics forbid ESP and faster-than-light travel, the invariable answer is: you do not know what advanced civilizations will discover a thousand years from now, as though the nature of the universe is going to change in that time. The idea \u2014 the wish \u2014 is stronger than the facts. Paranormal theories are of two types: mystical and physical. Mystical theories or phenomena are based on entities of a transcendental nature: psychic energy, spiritual energy, auras, direct perception, etc., and include all the varied aspects of ESP, astrology, and new-age beliefs. None of these phenomena exist within the framework of physics. There are only four kinds of energy known to particle physics (in addition to kinetic energy) and none of them are spiritual in nature. Other paranormal phenomena pretend to be physical in nature: anti-gravity, perpetual motion, faster-than-light travel and time travel are listed under pseudoscience. The anti-gravity enthusiast takes the position that we do not know what gravity is, and therefore we cannot predict what we may yet discover about it. The realist, on the other hand, says we do know how gravity behaves, and what we know tells us that there is no way of arranging matter in such a way as to produce a gravitational repulsion or shield. While perpetual motion and UFO enthusiasts may not call on mysticism and supernatural entities for their theories, they behave like idealists in the sense that they believe their own ideas are more important than the physical evidence to the contrary. I have carried on a frustrating correspondence with a person who complains that scientists never worry about the cause of gravity. He claims that his theory \u2014 based on compressions from outer space \u2014 can explain the cause of gravity better than any other theory. This person refuses to acknowledge that his theory cannot even explain the inverse-square law. In addition, he refuses to acknowledge the fact that Einstein did worry about the cause of gravitation and produced the general theory of relativity as a result. He claims his theory is the only valid theory of gravity and it is the duty of scientists to prove him wrong (as though the methods of science are the same as courtroom procedures). Ideas \u2014 which he spins out ad infinitum \u2014 are more important to this paradoxer than reality. 5. Ordinary and Extraordinary Claims A saying currently popular among skeptics is that \"extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof.\" An example of an extraordinary claim is one that violates the fundamental laws of physics \u2014 that requires actions not allowed within the standard model of particle physics. To prove an extraordinary claim of a physical sort \u2014 let us say a gravitational shield providing the power of levitation \u2014 one would have to do an experiment that verifies the claim. The method of doing this experiment would be ordinary enough, but if the result verified the claim it would be a most extraordinary result. In the medical or psychological sciences one often must resort to statistical experiments using the methods of epidemiology. ESP experiments are of this nature. Medical epidemiological studies are notorious in producing conflicting results. Some reports say that food A is bad for you; others say that food A is good for you. Some reports say that low frequency electromagnetic fields cause cancer; other reports say they do not. The reason is that the studies are looking for tiny effects immersed in statistical noise. The same is true for ESP experiments. If the ESP effects were large enough to be both reproducible and useful, they could be verified by ordinary epidemiological methods. They would not require extraordinary methods. Indeed, if ESP effects were sufficiently large, a single experiment would demonstrate their reality. The moral: extraordinary claims that are valid can be verified by ordinary methods. The reason most extraordinary claims sound so extraordinary is that if they were true they would overthrow everything we know about modern physics. This is why we do not believe them until we have evidence that is irrefutable. 6. Reality and Religion The entities science deals with are observable with appropriate instruments. Or else, as in the case of quarks, they are not directly observable, but they produce measurable effects (and we know why they are hiding). These entities interact with each other according to laws which operate consistently on all forms of matter. The purpose of science is to determine what these laws are and how they operate. In the realm of physics this purpose has culminated in the Standard Model of particle physics. Religion also deals with entities and laws. The entities of religious literature are gods of various kinds, heaven, hell, prayer, supernatural forces, and sacred objects. In modern physics there is no mention of gods, heaven, or hell or, indeed, anything that is in the least bit supernatural. Thus, the realistic weltanschauung has no point of intersection with the religious viewpoint. More than that: there is no objective evidence that demonstrates the reality of gods, heaven, hell, or supernatural forces. On the contrary, there is copious evidence leading to the conclusion that these entities are invented by humans for a variety of psychological reasons. They are simple ways to understand the nature of the universe. Looked at from this point of view, religion is simply another example of belief in the paranormal. Religious theories require the believer to accept telepathic communication from man to god (prayer), and from god to man (the word of god). There is no requirement to identify what kind of force or interaction carries this telepathic information. Regardless of advances in scientific knowledge, most people maintain religious beliefs. Thus we must recognize that religion is a real phenomenon from the psychological and sociological point of view. This is easily understood by noting that religious beliefs originated long before we had instruments capable of showing us what the world is really like. Since religious belief is handed down by early training from parent to child, a predisposition to religious belief is difficult to shake off when the child grows to maturity. This accounts for the fact that so many scientists are religious, even though they have the tools to understand the universe in a rational manner. (I believe, however, that if a poll were taken it would show that the percentage of atheists among scientists is greater than in the public at large. But this is an unsubstantiated guess.) In graduate school I knew a physics student who was so orthodox he would not use a telephone on Saturday. Later he became a very important physicist, head of the department of a major university. Cases like this represent an extreme compartmentalization of two opposing beliefs in different parts of the mind. (I use the term \"mind\" metaphorically.) Religion also has dimensions beyond simple matters of gods, heaven, and hell. Religious beliefs deal with ethics and morality; they govern a culture's behavior. They also provide comfort for those who need it. Prayer and religious music have important effects that can be understood psychologically. For this reason a realistic philosophy that attempts to replace the idealistic philosophies of the religions must tread with care. It must not leave a vacuum, but must create an ethical system that is not based on supernatural entities, together with a way to comfort the masses without the religious opiate. Religionists often object to scientific explanations, on the ground that reductionist theories are unable to account for complex phenomena such as life and consciousness. However, we can understand life without trying to build up the structure of living organisms from a knowledge of elementary particle theory. The standard model of particle theory merely gives us a framework in which to operate. The study of life from the top down is a more fruitful way to go, and our exploding knowledge of the DNA molecule demonstrates how powerful our methods are. I hereby place a bet that our biologists will learn how to synthesize living matter during the next century. In conclusion, the ironic fact is that religion has no ability to explain anything. While scientific discovery has increased exponentially during the past century, religious discovery has remained a flat zero. There have been important historical discoveries, but no improvements in explaining where the gods reside, how they interact with man, where the gods lived before the universe was formed, and how they learned how to create the universe. (I use the plural gods, because each religion has its own variety of god.) Recent attempts to claim that a god caused the Big Bang really do not explain anything. They just push the unanswered questions back into the past. Bibliography - Bell, J.S. 1987. Speakable and Unspeakable in Quantum Mechanics.

But he also argues that technology is an extension of life \u2014 and an acceleration of the mind. Technology is not anti-nature, but rather the \"seventh kingdom\" of life: it now shares with life certain biases, urges, needs and tendencies. The system of technology that Kelly calls the \"technium,\" unconsciously \"wants\" to head in certain directions, just as do life and evolution. The technium functions as a living, natural system. Just as evolution has tendencies, urges, trajectories, established forms, and a direction, so too does the technium. Where is it headed? What is the true nature of its increasing presence in our society? And how do the goals of the technological agenda relate to humanity's goals?

About this week's eSkeptic In this week's eSkeptic, we present an explosive interview with one of the most controversial scientists of our generation: Richard Dawkins, on the triumphs, limitations, uses and abuses of Darwinism. This interview was first published in the sold out issue of [Skeptic magazine volume 3, number 4](https://www.skeptic.com/magazine/archives/vol03n04.html) (1995). Richard Dawkins, one of the leading thinkers in modern evolutionary biology, is also one of the best writers on the subject. The New York Times Book Review has hailed him as a writer who \"understands the issues so clearly that he forces his reader to understand them too.\" Check out [our online store](https://shop.skeptic.com//merchant.mvc?Screen=CTGY&Store_Code=SS&Category_Code=TPIRD) for many of Richard Dawkin's books, lectures and DVDs.

Recently, Dawkins [lectured at Caltech](https://www.skeptic.com/lectures/the-greatest-show-on-earth/) as part of the Skeptics Society's Distinguished Lecture Series. His lecture, now [available on DVD](https://www.skeptic.com/productlink/av219), was based on his book [The Greatest Show on Earth: the Evidence for Evolution](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1416594795?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1416594795). Never one to shy away from controversy, here is what the man Wired magazine termed \"the Bad Boy of Evolution\" had to say to Skeptic (back in 1995) about Darwinism, extra-terrestrial life, religion as a virus of the mind, morality, politics, punctuated equilibrium, and the future of evolutionary biology. Darwin's Dangerous Disciple An Interview with Richard Dawkins by Frank Miele S keptic: In your latest book, [River Out of Eden](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0465069908?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0465069908) (lecture [available on DVD](https://www.skeptic.com/productlink/av036)), which is a best seller in the UK, you use deep-sea bacteria that metabolize sulfur (rather than oxygen) to illustrate how evolution takes place in a series of successive steps. Does the existence here on Earth of an alternative metabolic \"fuel,\" in some sense make it more probable that there could be life elsewhere in the universe, perhaps using a different base than carbon? Dawkins: That's surely got to be right, hasn't it? You can speculate in a science fiction way about alternative bio-chemistries for life, but if you couldn't find anything on Earth moving ever so slightly towards an alternative bio-chemistry, that would argue against the idea. But when you do find an alternative biochemistry for life here on Earth, that makes it more plausible that somewhere else in the universe there's got to be an alternative form of life. Skeptic: What then is the sine qua non of life? What raw materials and conditions are necessary for life to exist? Dawkins: Well, you need raw materials that can self-replicate. I would have to be more of a chemist than I am to know how likely it is that you are going to get such molecules. I should very much like to direct chemists toward devising an alternative hypothetical chemistry that supports self-replication, a whole alternative system that could, in principle, give rise to life. The fundamental principle that will be required is self-replication. Chemists have begun to look at auto-catalytic functions in chemistry where at least some of the prerequisites are present. The sine qua non, as you say, is self-replication. I don't know how difficult it would be to achieve that chemically. Skeptic: How likely do you think it is that \"intelligent\" life exists somewhere else in the universe? Dawkins: At first glance, one might think that the really difficult step is getting life at all. Then once natural selection has gotten going (since the origin of life is really the origin of natural selection), you can proceed by an orderly progressive sequence through the evolution of some kind of information processing apparatus on to intelligence. On the other hand, if you look at what's actually happened on this planet, it probably took less than a billion years from the origin of the planet, under fairly unfavorable initial conditions, to produce life. But intelligence of a high order has only come about in the last couple of million years, perhaps. So it does seem that on this planet at least there has been a rather short interval from the origin of the planet to the origin of life and then a very, very long interval between the origin of life and the origin of intelligence. Skeptic: Are you then saying that the origin of intelligence is the bigger step? Dawkins: It's not my inclination to say that, but this disparity in time scale is the only data we have. We only have one sample \u2014 life on this planet. But for that fact, my personal inclination would have been to suggest that the origin of intelligence is not that difficult once you've got life. I'm quite intrigued by the thought that maybe it's the origin of life that's not that difficult. Skeptic: If so, what are the defining qualities of such \"intelligence?\" I'm thinking here of concepts such as Immanuel Kant's list of apriori ideas \u2014 time and space, number, cause and effect. Could, for example, a form of life evolve in whose mental map time's arrow went backwards, or in no specific direction? Dawkins: As for what one means by intelligence, I haven't really thought about that. You posed the hypothetical question, \"Could there be a life form whose concept of time goes backward?\" I can't imagine what that would look like. But I haven't thought about it enough. Skeptic: Of other species we know about here on Earth, we're very familiar with cats and dogs. I was always amazed (and delighted) how my dogs could coexist with me given that their set of sensory inputs was so different from mine \u2014 they see in black and white. They don't have the level of stereoscopic vision that humans and apes do. They use scent and vision in approximately opposite proportions. Yet they can come up with an equivalent map of the world so that they can fetch the paper, protect us from intruders, comfort us in distress. What does this tell us about the evolutionary process and how it molds not only the bodies but the cognitive maps of different species? Dawkins: That's an intriguing point. One thing you could say about dogs is that they have been domesticated, and a good deal of the domestication has been an inadvertent selection for coexisting with humans. While their wild ancestors, the wolves, do have facial expressions and other gestures which they use to communicate with each other, it's probable that domestic dogs have been selected to have more human feelings and facial expressions. So while dogs don't smile, they do other things with their eyes that appeal to humans. Maybe they have been shaped to be a bit less wolf-like and a bit more human-like, not by deliberate artificial selection, but by artificial selection nonetheless. Skeptic: In the 1930s, von Uexk\u00fcll used the term Umwelt to describe the different \"real worlds\" that animals construct based upon their differing sensory systems. He even built mechanical devices to try and create their perceptual Weltanschauungen. He manufactured optical devices to simulate the compound eyes of insects to allow one to see \"what they saw.\" With virtual reality now a reality, we could certainly do such things at a more sophisticated level than von Uexk\u00fcll did. Do you think this might be a potentially valuable line of research? Dawkins: Von Uexk\u00fcll used the concept of the Umwelt to explore the differences between the perceptual worlds of different animals. He tried to find a way to \"think himself into\" the Umwelt (the perceptual world) of a bee or a bat, for example, by seeing the polarization of light or by seeing into the ultraviolet range of the spectrum and thus probably not seeing images as we see images at all. I think it's a very important thing to do that, partly as a metaphor for \"getting outside yourself\" and seeing another point of view. We have an immensely human-centered view of things such as ethics and morality. Even if we pay lip service to being evolutionists, many people still think according to the Judeo-Christian view that all things have been put on Earth for the benefit of humanity and that the only justification for scientific research is if it benefits humanity. I think it's a salutary lesson to try to \"think yourself into\" the Umwelt of another species. But as I said in my talk last night before the Human Behavior and Evolution Society, I suspect that the perceptual world of other species possibly may not be as different from our own as you might think, even though they get their information through different physical media. Skeptic: So then doesn't natural selection force us to assume that time's arrow flies in a certain direction? Doesn't natural selection force us to operate on the basis of Kant's a priori ideas and Piaget's operations? Dawkins: Yes, I agree with that. Skeptic: In your speech the other night you said that the perceptual systems of animals represent the world as their near, or possibly even far, ancestors constructed them based upon natural selection. Can the world evolve faster than the sensory systems of the animals? Are many animals living today in a sensory world that no longer exists, as when the moth flies into the candle flame? Dawkins: When a moth flies into a candle flame presumably it is responding to the candle flame as if were a celestial object at optical infinity and acting appropriately to that situation, not the one it is in fact currently facing. It frequently happens that the real world evolves faster than an animal's cognitive map of it. Skeptic: Does that ever happen to human beings? Dawkins: Human beings are completely surrounded by the equivalent of \"candle flames.\" Notorious examples are our desire for sugar and fat \u2014 in nature the rule is, whenever you can get them, eat them. But when there's a surplus of those substance, they become bad for you. Most of what we strive for in our modern life uses the apparatus of goal seeking that was originally set up to seek goals in the state of nature. But now the goal-seeking apparatus has been switched to different goals, like making money or hedonistic pleasures of one sort or another. Natural selection equips us with \"Rules of Thumb,\" which in a state of nature have the effect of promoting the survival of our selfish genes. The Rules of Thumb go on, even though in this world of \"candle flames\" they no longer promote our inclusive fitness. Skeptic: Would you consider increasing population and war to be examples of candle flames? Dawkins: Increasing population itself is not an individual behavior pattern. It's a consequence of many things which are manifestations of individual behavior in a collective environment. To take a much simpler case, the dominance hierarchy is a manifestation of attacking and subservience between pairs of individuals, but the dominance hierarchy itself is not something that natural selection favors or disfavors. What natural selection favors or disfavors is the individual behavior of which the dominance hierarchy is a manifestation. I would put war and overpopulation in that category. Skeptic: In River Out of Eden, you also say that, \"Science shares with religion the claim that it answers deep questions about origins, the nature of life, and the cosmos. But there the resemblance ends. Scientific beliefs are supported by evidence, and they get results. Myths and faiths are not and do not\" (p. 33). But doesn't one first have to make the choice or decision to use pragmatism as the standard by which we judge? That is, we must first agree to base our decisions on what works, rather than on revelation or intuition. Isn't the most we can ask of the religious crowd, \"Either lay hands on flat tires and pray for the sick, rather than taking them to a mechanic or a doctor, or if you are not willing to be consistent, just shut up and go away?\" Doesn't the religious view amount to, \"When we're afraid, we seek God. When God doesn't answer our prayers, blame it on the Devil?\" Dawkins: Yes, it's a kind of pathetic, childish response to some failure. Skeptic: Then could you say that the reason that evolutionism is resisted so strongly is that our minds evolved to think in terms of personalities and entities rather than in terms of processes? Dawkins: Yes, it's the idea that somebody has got to be responsible. It's what children do \u2014 the petulant throwing the tennis racquet on the ground, blaming it for their bad shot. So is the reflex to sue somebody when you slip on the ice and sprain your ankle. Again, somebody has got to be blamed. It doesn't occur to many people that nobody's to blame, there's just ice and it's slippery and you fell down. Skeptic: Along that line, you have the following passage in River Out of Eden: In a universe of blind physical forces and genetic replication, some people are going to get hurt, other people are going to get lucky, and you won't find any rhyme or reason in it, nor any justice. The universe we observe has precisely the properties we should expect if there is, at bottom, no design, no purpose, no evil and no good, nothing but blind, pitiless indifference (p.133). This sounds rather like physicist Steven Weinberg's, \"the more the universe seems comprehensible, the more it seems pointless\" ( [The First Three Minutes](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0465024378?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0465024378)), or William Shakespeare's \"a tale told by an idiot, filled with sound and fury, signifying nothing.\" Is that in fact your position? Dawkins: Yes, at a sort of cosmic level, it is. But what I want to guard against is people therefore getting nihilistic in their personal lives. I don't see any reason for that at all. You can have a very happy and fulfilled personal life even if you think that the universe at large is a tale told by an idiot. You can still set up goals and have a very worthwhile life and not be nihilistic about it at a personal level. Skeptic: Well, if we don't accept religion as a reasonable guide to \"what is\" or even a reasonable guide to \"what ought to be,\" does evolution give us such a guide? Can we turn to evolution to answer not what is, but what ought to be? Dawkins: I'd rather not do that. I think Julian Huxley was the last person who attempted to. In my opinion, a society run along \"evolutionary\" lines would not be a very nice society in which to live. But further, there's no logical reason why we should try to derive our normative standards from evolution. It's perfectly consistent to say this is the way it is \u2014 natural selection is out there and it is a very unpleasant process. Nature is red in tooth and claw. But I don't want to live in that kind of a world. I want to change the world in which I live in such a way that natural selection no longer applies. Skeptic: But given the clay from which we are made, doesn't natural selection make it relatively unlikely that some things will work? Doesn't Darwinism undercut the great socialist hope, \"Why, because we will it so!\"? Dawkins: Some goals may be unrealistic. But that doesn't mean that we should turn around the other way and say therefore we should strive to make a Darwinian millennium come true. Skeptic: But then isn't what we ought to do (as David Hume argued long ago) just a matter of preference and choice, custom and habit? Dawkins: I think that's very likely true. But I don't think that having conceded that point, I as an individual should then be asked to abandon my own ethical system or goals. I as an individual can adopt idealistic or socialistic or unrealistic or whatever sort of norms of charity and good will towards other people. They may be doomed if you take a strong Darwinian line on human nature, but it's not obvious to me that they are. Skeptic: I think that you are saying that many of the lessons of evolutionary biology about morality or ethics are contrary to what we might normally call morality or ethics in ordinary discourse. When we look back at the Old Testament and the New Testament, it seems there's a lot about how to maximize one's inclusive fitness. If that's the case, do such religious views have anything to tell us? Dawkins: If it is true that some of the morality of the Old Testament, say, maximizes somebody's inclusive fitness, I don't think that has anything to tell us about what we ought to do. Skeptic: Then wouldn't we be better to throw out all this half-baked religious mumbo jumbo and move on to something else? Dawkins: Well yes, but that's obvious! Skeptic: Do you think that group fitness is a meaningful concept in evolutionary biology? If so, does it play a role in discussions of evolution and morality? Dawkins: I think it's logically meaningful, but I don't think it plays a role in evolution in the wild and therefore it doesn't play a role in anything else. I think it's of no importance. Skeptic: Can we use Darwinism and natural selection to analyze other events in history? To put it in its crudest form, if Hitler had won WWII would that have proved that his system was better (in a Darwinian sense) than that of the Allies? Or does the fact that the Soviet Bloc crumbled tell us anything about the relative fitness of market-based economies versus command economies. If might (or at least survival and reproduction) doesn't make right (as well as everything else), what does? Dawkins: I think it is not helpful to apply Darwinian language too widely. Conquest of nation by nation is too distant for Darwinian explanations to be helpful. Darwinism is the differential survival of self-replicating genes in a gene pool, usually as manifested by individual behavior, morphology, and phenotypes. Group selection of any kind is not Darwinism as Darwin understood it nor as I understand it. There is a very vague analogy between group selection and conquest of a nation by another nation, but I don't think it's a very helpful analogy. So I would prefer not to invoke Darwinian language for that kind of historical interpretation. Skeptic: The publication of the controversial book, The Bell Curve, has set off yet another round in the seemingly never-ending nature-nurture (or heredity-environment) controversy. Is this in fact a false dichotomy? You had this passage in The Selfish Gene (1989, p. 37): No one factor, genetic, or environmental, can be considered as the single 'cause' of any part of a baby. All parts of a baby have a near infinite number of antecedent causes. But a difference [original emphasis] between one baby and another, for example a difference in length of leg, might easily be traced to one or a few simple antecedent differences, either in environment or in genes. It is differences that matter in the competitive struggle to survive; and it is genetically-controlled differences that matter in evolution. Doesn't a passage like this indicate why E.O. Wilson's [Sociobiology](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0674002350?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0674002350), The Bell Curve, and your own writings automatically set off a vehement, moralistic, and often hysterical reaction from a cadre of left-wing scientists? Dawkins: On the face of it, I don't know why you lump those three books together. When I was talking about genetic differences as being analyzable, that's the position of any geneticist. All I was saying was that when you look at something like eye color in Drosophila (or indeed in humans), although there are hundreds of genes and environmental factors that enter into making an eye, nevertheless if there's a one gene difference at a particular locus between two individuals, that can be the determining factor as to why that particular individual has a pink eye rather than a black eye. That is just straight genetics. You can't get away from that. The reason why left-wing ideologues attack books like The Bell Curve has nothing to do with that. Those critics are concerned with issues like race and I never mention race. I don't mind mentioning race, but it has nothing to do with what I was talking about. Skeptic: But those same left-wing critics also attack your books. Dawkins: But they don't read them! Skeptic: Well, you document examples of such attacks in the end notes to the 1989 edition of The Selfish Gene. Isn't it just as ideological for Marxism to be brought in as an argument against genetic differences as it is to bring in Biblical fundamentalism as an argument against Darwinian evolution? Aren't we dealing with religion, rather than science here? Dawkins: I suspect that we may be. The reason I think so is that the criticisms in some cases just seem to be silly. They seem to be a hysterical reaction to a misunderstanding. It's as though some people think that any mention of genes in the context of human behavior is somehow tainted with the tar of Social Darwinism and all the horrors that social scientists see in the history of their subject. So instead of just calmly and peacefully sitting down and thinking about what actually is the truth \u2014 \"Are there genes that influence behavior?,\" the immediate response is to flame up old fires of what once upon a time were important political issues. That kind of thing bores me rigid! I care about what's actually true. Skeptic: In a Darwinian sense, isn't it somewhat meaningless to argue about any supposed displacement of \"superior\" beings by \"inferior\" beings, or that evolution \"is going backwards.\" Don't such arguments turn Darwinism on its head? Dawkins: Because whatever evolves is, by definition, superior? There's nothing nonsensical about saying that what would evolve if Darwinian selection has its head is something that you don't want to happen. And I could easily imagine trying to go against Darwinism. I don't see why that's inconsistent. I can easily imagine saying that in a Darwinian world, the fittest, by definition, are the ones that survive and the attributes that you need to survive in Darwinian sense are the attributes that I don't want to see in the world. I can easily see myself fighting against the success of Darwinism prevailing in the world. Skeptic: Shortly after publication of The Selfish Gene, you wrote a letter to the editor of Nature [the leading British science magazine, similar to Science here in the US], in which you stated that kin selection theory in no way provides a basis for understanding ethnocentrism. You said you made this statement, in part at least, to counter charges that were being made in the UK at that time by Marxist critics that Selfish Gene Theory was being used by the British National Front to support their Fascist ideology. In retrospect, do you think you went too far in trying to distance yourself from some would-be and very unwanted enthusiasts, or not far enough? Dawkins: As to distancing myself from the National Front, that I did! The National Front was saying something like this, \"kin selection provides the basis for favoring your own race as distinct from other races, as a kind of generalization of favoring your own close family as opposed to other individuals.\" Kin selection doesn't do that! Kin selection favors nepotism towards your own immediate close family. It does not favor a generalization of nepotism towards millions of other people who happen to be the same color as you. Even if it did, and this is a stronger point, I would oppose any suggestion from any group such as the National Front, that whatever occurs in natural selection is therefore morally good or desirable. We come back to this point over and over again. I'm definitely not one who thinks that \"is\" is the same as \"ought.\" Skeptic: How do you evaluate the work of Iren\u00e4us Eibl-Eibesfeldt, J.P. Rushton, and Pierre van den Berghe, all of whom have argued that kin selection theory does help explain nationalism and patriotism? Dawkins: One could invoke a kind \"misfiring\" of kin selection if you wanted to in such cases. Misfirings are common enough in evolution. For example, when a cuckoo host feeds a baby cuckoo, that is a misfiring of behavior which is naturally selected to be towards the host's own young. There are plenty of opportunities for misfirings. I could imagine that racist feeling could be a misfiring, not of kin selection but of reproductive isolation mechanisms. At some point in our history there may have been two species of humans who were capable of mating together but who might have produced sterile hybrids (such as mules). If that were true, then there could have been selection in favor of a \"horror\" of mating with the other species. Now that could misfire in the same sort of way that the cuckoo host's parental impulse misfires. The rule of thumb for that hypothetical avoiding of miscegenation could be \"Avoid mating with anybody of a different color (or appearance) from you.\" I'm happy for people to make speculations along those lines as long as they don't again jump that is-ought divide and start saying, \"therefore racism is a good thing.\" I don't think racism is a good thing. I think it's a very bad thing. That is my moral position. I don't see any justification in evolution either for or against racism. The study of evolution is not in the business of providing justifications for anything. Skeptic: In The Extended Phenotype you talk about the Green Beard Effect, and last night Napoleon Chagnon, the President of the Human Behavior and Evolution Society, actually dyed his beard green before introducing you. What is the Green Beard Effect and why do you mention it only to then dismiss it as being too improbable to be a factor in evolution? Dawkins: I use The Green Beard Effect as a way of explaining kin selection. If you imagine a gene that has two pleiotropic effects that apparently have nothing to do with each other (and in practice that's common enough), if one of its effects is to give somebody a label, such as the Green Beard, and the other is to give somebody a propensity to act altruistically towards individuals so labeled (that is, Green-Bearded individuals), then theoretically that gene will spread. The Green Beard Effect is a way in which a would-be selectively altruistic gene can recognize copies of itself in other individuals. That means that the gene can propagate itself by looking after copies of itself when it has the opportunity to do so. That's relatively easy to understand. But as far as I know, in practice Green Beards don't exist. But kinship is a kind of statistical Green Beard. Although your brother is not guaranteed to contain the gene that's making you practice \"fraternal\" behavior towards him, the odds that he has that gene are statistically higher than the odds that a random member of the population has it. Kinship is therefore a statistically watered down version of the Green Beard Effect that actually works. Skeptic: Could there be selection for a mechanism that would operate like this \u2014 \"those who look like me, talk like me, act like me, are probably genetically close to me. Therefore, be nice, good, and altruistic to them. If not avoid them?\" And could that mechanism later be programmed to say \"be good to someone who wears the same baseball cap, the same Rugby colors, or whatever?\" That is, could evolution have a produced a hardware mechanism that is software programmable? Dawkins: I think that's possible. Skeptic: In his book, [Complexity](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0226476553?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0226476553), Roger Lewin includes interviews with a number of evolutionary biologists. One of the topics they examine is progress. Is there a general tendency towards progress in terms of say, increasing neural complexity, increasing brain size, or increasing behavioral plasticity over the course of evolution? Or is this, as Stephen Jay Gould has termed it, a rather noxious concept that we should read out of evolutionary thinking? Dawkins: I think that there has been an almost hysterical over-reaction against the concept of progress. I've been as against some mistaken interpretations of the concept of progress as anybody. I very, very strongly object to the idea that living creatures can be arranged on a ladder, a kind of phylogenetic scale, with humans at the top. Not only should we not treat humans as being on the top, we should not see the animal kingdom as being layered as we often do. All zoology textbooks present their chapters in the same order \u2014 you start with protozoa, then you move through the coelenterates, then the flatworms, then the round worms and so on. Certainly that interpretation of progress is just a logical error. Evolution is a branching tree and that's all there is to it. However, it is another matter to say that there is no progressive evolution within one lineage as you go from the distant past, through the more recent descendants, up to the present. There very well could be such progress. To the extent that adaptation is to the a-biotic environment (such as the weather), you would expect no progress. Evolutionary change would simply track the weather. If it gets cold, you get a thick coat. If it gets hot, you shed your thick coat, and so on. To the extent that adaptations are to the biotic environment (that is, other organisms, rather than natural conditions), then it seems to me quite plausible that there is in fact a progressive arms race as I term it. The better a predator gets at running down prey, the more it pays the prey to shift resources into anti-predator adaptations and out of other aspects of life. There are always trade-offs in the economy of life. If the predators are getting really good at their job, it makes sense for the prey to shift resources (which admittedly could have been put into making more offspring), into making better legs for running or better sense organs for detecting the predators. The predators then shift their resources accordingly. Given the extraordinary elegance and beauty and complexity of the adaptations that we see all around us in living creatures, I think it's ludicrous to deny that those are the result of progressive evolution. There has been progress. Skeptic: In your most recent book, River Out of Eden, you try to clear up some misunderstandings about the First Mother and the First Father. Would you like to repeat them? Dawkins: I refer to things like the belief that Mitochondrial Eve was, like the mythical Biblical Eve, the only woman on Earth. Nonsense, she could have been the member of a huge population. She's simply the common ancestor of all living humans. Another error is to think that Mitochondrial Eve is our most recent common ancestor. She most certainly is not our most recent common ancestor. That distinction much more likely goes to a male. The reason for that is pure logic and it's spelled out in River Out of Eden. Skeptic: A few years ago, you and Stephen Jay Gould got in to a bit of an intellectual row about the question of punctuated equilibrium. By the time you wrote The Blind Watchmaker you seemed to say that more was made of the controversy by journalists than was warranted. What is your current position on this controversy? Dawkins: I think that punctuated equilibrium is a minor wrinkle on Darwinism, of no great theoretical significance. It has been vastly oversold. Skeptic: Why? Dawkins: That's a matter of individual psychology and motivation and not my province. Skeptic: You also took a bit of flak for likening religion (I think specifically Catholicism) to a virus? Is that still your position? Dawkins: Yes. I come to it through the analogy to computer viruses. We have two kinds of viruses that have a lot in common \u2014 namely real biological viruses and computer viruses. In both cases they are parasitic self-replicating codes which exploit the existence of machinery that was set up to copy and obey that kind of code. So I then ask the question, \"What if there were a third kind of milieu in which a different kind of self-replicating code could become an effective parasite?\" Human brains with their powerful communication systems seem to be a likely candidate. Then I ask, \"What would it feel like if you were the victim of a mind virus?\" Well, you would feel within your-self this deep conviction that seems to come from nowhere. It doesn't result from any evidence, but you have a total conviction that you know what's true about the world and the cosmos and life. You just know it and you're even prepared to kill people who disagree with you. You go around proselytizing and persuading other people to accept your view. The more you write down the features that such a mind virus would have, the more it starts to look like religion. I do think that the Roman Catholic religion is a disease of the mind which has a particular epidemiology similar to that of a virus. Skeptic: But couldn't the Pope (or Evangelical Protestants for that matter), reply, \"Look, we just have a terrific meme. It's winning what you would describe as a Darwinian battle and you're angry because you just don't like it.\" Dawkins: Religion is a terrific meme. That's right. But that doesn't make it true and I care about what's true. Smallpox virus is a terrific virus. It does its job magnificently well. That doesn't mean that it's a good thing. It doesn't mean that I don't want to see it stamped out. Skeptic: So once again the discussion goes back to how do you determine whether something is good or not, other than by just your personal choice? Dawkins: I don't even try. You keep wanting to base morality on Darwinism. I don't. Skeptic: Given the number of popular and scientific controversies in which you have been involved, is there anything on which you have changed your mind, on which you'd like to correct the record, or which you see differently now than you did when you first became a household name? Dawkins: Well, my second book, The Extended Phenotype, published in 1982 and summarized at the end of the second edition of The Selfish Gene, does downplay the role of the individual organism as the only vehicle of the genetic replicators. Previously, I rather blurred the distinction between vehicle and replicator. In The Extended Phenotype, I emphasize the distinction. I think I was right to say that fundamentally what is going on in natural selection is the differential survival of replicators. Replicators survive by virtue of their phenotypic effects upon the world. As it happens, it is a contingent fact that most of those phenotypic effects tend to be bound up in the vehicle (the particular individual body) in which the replicator (the gene) is housed. But that doesn't have to be so. I use the didactic device of looking at animal artifacts like beaver dams, the effects of parasites on hosts, animal communications, and indeed all of the interactions in ecosystems as illustrations of the ways in which genes might in principle and sometimes in fact do insure their survival by exerting phenotypic effects outside of the body in which they reside. That's a kind of change of mind. My original purpose in introducing the concept of memes really was not to produce a theory of culture, but rather to say that Darwinism doesn't have to be tied to genes. It can work wherever you have a self-replicating code. We should actively be looking around for other examples of self-replicating codes which are \"doing the Darwinian thing.\" The important thing is not to get too hung up on genes when you're doing your evolutionary biology. Skeptic: What are the areas in biology into which Darwinism should be extended? Dawkins: Sex is one that is being actively worked on. That is, the question of why it exists. Then there's the embryological gap. In our Darwinism we postulate that there are genes for this and genes for that. We just leave the embryological causal link between genes and phenotype as a black box. We know that genes do, in fact, cause changes in phenotypes and that's all we really need in order for Darwinism to work. But it would be nice to fill in the details of exactly what goes on inside the black box. To me, human consciousness is a deep, philosophically mysterious manifestation of brain activity and is in some sense a product of Darwinian evolution. But we don't yet really have any idea how it evolved and where it fits into a Darwinian view of biology. I don't know whether it will yield to a sudden flash of enlightenment, whether it will become one of those rather messy problems that never really get a proper solution, or whether it will eventually turn out that there never was a problem at all and that we were actually making up problems where there really weren't any. From where I sit, it seems to be a deeply difficult problem that has always been a philosophical problem but which I think is ripe for a take-over by evolutionary biology once we think how to do it. Skeptic: Thank you very much. Glossary - ALLELE(S) - The alternative forms of a gene that can exist at a particular locus. Thus, A, B, and O are the alleles of the ABO blood group system; positive and negative are the alleles of the Rh system. - GREEN BEARD EFFECT - A term coined by Dawkins for the situation in which a gene has two effects (pleiotropy), one of which produces a recognizable phenotypic trait (the hypothetical Green Beard) and the other produces the tendency to manifest altruistic behavior toward others who also manifest that trait. - GROUP SELECTION (THEORY) - The theory that natural selection also operates at the level of the group and not just the individual organism. - INCLUSIVE FITNESS - The total reproductive success of an individual, including the proportionate success of his relatives based on the percentage of genes they share in common (100% for identical twins, 50% [on average] for siblings, parents, or offspring, 12.5% for first cousins, and so on). - KIN SELECTION (THEORY) - The selection of genes so as to cause individuals to favor their close genetic relatives as they are statistically likely to share genes in common. Often invoked to provide a neo-Darwinian explanation of behaviors such as altruism. - MEME(S) - A term coined by Dawkins for units of cultural inheritance, analogous to genes (the units of genetic transmission), which are acted upon by natural selection. - MITOCHONDRIA - The cell organelles that are the site of energy-releasing biochemical reactions. Mitochondria have their own DNA, which is passed through the female line only and thus is often used in tracing genetic lineages. MITOCHONDRIAL EVE, believed by some to be the common ancestor of all humans, was determined by analysis of mitochondrial DNA. - PHENOTYPE - The observed trait, morphological or behavioral, manifested by an organism. It is the product of the organism's genotype and the environment in which the organism has developed. - PLEIOTROPY(-IC, -ISM) - The condition in which one gene produces two (or more) different phenotypic traits. - PUNCTUATED EQUILIBRIUM (THEORY OF) - The theory proposed by Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldridge that evolution can consist of long periods of stasis (no change), punctuated by short periods of rapid change (speciation events), rather than a steady series of small, incremental steps. Editor's note: The above interview, along with the John Hartung article on the evolution of in-group morality found in [volume 3, number 4](https://www.skeptic.com/magazine/archives/vol03n04.html) (sold out), served as an introduction to [volume 4, number 1](https://www.skeptic.com/magazine/archives/vol04n01.html) of Skeptic that featured a special section on the controversial field of evolutionary psychology in which human behavior \u2014 including and especially the human mind \u2014 is analyzed through a strict Darwinian paradigm. Proponents and critics spoke out on this and other controversies brewing in the general study of evolution. Skeptical perspectives on evolution from Richard Dawkins - [The Greatest Show on Earth:](https://www.skeptic.com/productlink/av219) the Evidence for Evolution (DVD $23.95) with Richard Dawkins - - [River Out of Eden: A Darwinian View of Life](https://www.skeptic.com/productlink/av036) (DVD $23.95) with Richard Dawkins - - [The Ancestor's Tale: A Pilgrimage to](https://www.skeptic.com/productlink/b092PB) the Dawn of Evolution Human Values](https://www.skeptic.com/lectures/sam-harris-moral-landscape-how-science-can-determine-human-values/) [Skeptic](https://www.skeptic.com/author/skeptic/)| Comments Off on The Moral Landscape: How Science Can Determine Human Values Sam Harris's first book, [The End of Faith](https://www.skeptic.com/productlink/b139PB), ignited a worldwide debate about the validity of religion. In the aftermath, Harris discovered that most people \u2014 from religious fundamentalists to nonbelieving scientists \u2014 agree on one point: science has nothing to say on the subject of human values. Indeed, our failure to address questions of meaning and morality through science has now become the most common justification for religious faith. It is also the primary reason why so many secularists and religious moderates feel obligated to \"respect\" the hardened superstitions of their more devout neighbors. In this lecture, based on his explosive book, [The Moral Landscape](https://www.skeptic.com/productlink/b141HB), Sam Harris tears down the wall between scientific facts and human values, arguing that most people are simply mistaken about the relationship between morality and the rest of human knowledge. Harris urges us to think about morality in terms of human and animal well-being, viewing the experiences of conscious creatures as peaks and valleys on a \"moral landscape.\" Just as there is no such thing as Christian physics or Muslim algebra, there can be no Christian or Muslim morality. This lecture was recorded on October 24, 2010 as part of the [Distinguished Science Lecture Series](https://www.skeptic.com/lectures/about/) hosted by Michael Shermer and presented by The Skeptics Society in California (1992-2015). We offer this lecture to you freely, and greatly and the Science of Climate Change August 7-14, 2011 IF YOU ONLY GO ON ONE CRUISE, MAKE IT THIS ONE! We have selected the best glacier cruise that we could find and added lectures from a world-renowned panel of distinguished experts for a hands-on voyage of discovery into the science of glaciers and climate change. Join Skeptics Society's founder Dr. Michael Shermer and geologist Dr. Donald Prothero to discover how glaciers form, and how they have changed throughout the planet's history. Learn about the science of ice cores and other climate indicators, and what they tell us about climates past and future. Discuss what can be done about climate change, and get the inside story on what government agencies are planning for the future. In Seattle, we will board Holland America's luxurious MS Oosterdam and spend seven amazing days in Alaska's Inside Passage, seeing some of the world's most beautiful scenery. The ship will cruise to spectacular glaciers in Glacier Bay, Misty Fjords, Mendenhall Glacier in Juneau, plus stops in Victoria, Sitka, and Ketchikan. For your entertainment, there will be a performance by the skeptical singer/satirist Roy Zimmerman. You will return to Seattle seven days later inspired and informed and exhilarated! Don't miss this once-in-a-lifetime chance to see global climate change in action, and learn about it from leading experts as we travel. See the glaciers before they're gone!

About our speakers DR. ANDERS CARLSON's research involves the interaction of ice sheets, oceans and the climate system on orbital to centennial time-scales.He is interested in the effects of deglaciation on climate, constructing paleoclimate records, and the role of the ocean in modulating the climate response between hemispheres. He also conducts research in paleo-glaciology looking at the influence of till and the substrate on ice sheet motion, and the development of basal drainage systems. He currently is working on the Laurentide and Greenland Ice Sheets, addressing the behavior of these ice sheets and their effects on climate over multiple glacial cycles. His approach to research uses a combination of dating methods (cosmogenic dating, radiocarbon), analytical techniques (isotope and trace element analysis, geochemistry), field geology, and conceptual and analytical models. He believes a holistic approach is required to place data into the global picture and vice versa for the applicability of models. RANDALL DUNCAN is an expert on emergency management and [FEMA](http://www.fema.gov/) planning for climate change. He teaches trainees at FEMA and in the state emergency management system, and is an Adjunct Faculty member teaching emergency management at Park University in Missouri.

SATIRIST/SONGWRITER ROY ZIMMERMAN What's funny about war, poverty, ignorance, bigotry, neo-conservatism, homophobia, greed, lust and fear? Ask Roy Zimmerman. He's been writing satirical songs for twenty years. Zimmerman has played clubs across the US, and shared the stage with George Carlin, Bill Maher, Kate Clinton, Dennis Miller, Sandra Tsing Loh, kd lang, Andy Borowitz and Paul Krassner. His up-to-the-moment topical songs are featured on American Public Media's syndicated broadcast \"Weekend America\" and Sirius Radio's \"West Coast a one-man show called \" [Faulty Intelligence](https://www.skeptic.com/productlink/av562CD).\" There's a decidedly lefty slant to his lyrics. \"We used to have a name for Right Wing satire,\" he says. \"We called it 'cruelty.'\" He has written for theater productions and founded and wrote all the material for the comedy folk quartet The Foremen, who recorded four albums, two of them for Warner/Reprise Records. They sang Zimmerman's Oliver North lampoon, \"Ollie Ollie Off Scot Free\" directly to the colonel himself on North's own syndicated show. \"Friends,\" said North, \"this is a very weird group.\" He has released a number of CDs including \"Faulty \"PeaceNick,\" \"Homeland\" and \"Security,\" and most recently. \"Real American.\" Zimmerman lives in Marin County with his wife and frequent co-writer Melanie Harby and their two boys. The Los Angeles Times says, \"Zimmerman displays a lacerating wit and keen awareness of society's foibles that bring to mind a latter-day Tom Lehrer.\" Tom Lehrer himself says, \"I congratulate Roy Zimmerman on reintroducing literacy to comedy songs. And the rhymes actually rhyme, they don't just 'rhyne.'\" Joni Mitchell says, \"Roy's lyrics move beyond poetry and achieve perfection.\" Lecture Schedule - AUGUST 8, 2011 8-11 AM - - Dr. Michael Shermer on The Believing Brain: From Ghosts and Gods to Politics and Conspiracies \u2014 How We Construct Beliefs and Reinforce Them as Truths - Dr. Donald Prothero on How Glaciers Work, and How Climate Changes - Dr. Bruce Molnia on The Retreat of the Glaciers - AUGUST 8, 2011 2-5 PM (hosted by Michael Shermer) - - Dr. Anders Carlson on Climate Change: Evidence from Ice Cores and Other Geological Indicators - Prothero on Science Denialism and Climate Change - Panel with Anders Carlson, Bruce Molnia and Donald Prothero on Science Denialism and Climate Change (moderated by Michael Shermer) - Dr. Anders Carlson on Climate Change: Evidence from Ice Cores - AUGUST 12, 2011 3-5 PM (hosted by Michael Shermer) - - Randall Duncan on Planning for Future Climate Change: an Emergency Management Prospective - Q & A with Anders Carlson, Randall Duncan, Bruce Molnia and Donald Prothero: an opportunity to Ask the Experts (moderated by Michael Shermer) - Randall Duncan on Planning for Future Climate Change: - AUGUST 13, 2011 3-5 PM (hosted by Michael Shermer) - - Performance by Roy Zimmerman About the cabins offered on our cruise There are three types of cabins available to us on this cruise: inside (J), ocean-view (D), and balcony (VD).

The Rise of Bat Boy In the pantheon of American monsters, only one truly dominated the newspapers of the 1990s. Checkout lines everywhere were haunted by the bald-headed, wide-mawed visage of Bat Boy. What was Bat Boy, and where did he come from? The MonsterTalk team interviews [cartoonist](http://www.thelightersideofscifi.com/) Tye Bourdony, a former employee of the Weekly World News. Bourdony shares his insights about Bat Boy and the rise and fall of the famous tabloid paper. In this week's eSkeptic, we present an excerpt from Tim Callahan's book [Bible Prophecy: Failure or Fulfillment?](https://www.skeptic.com/productlink/b048PB) (1997). The book covers all the major biblical prophecies (especially those concerned with the end times) and examines the paranoid style of conspiratorial thinking that has lead to a cornucopia of theories about who is really running the world, determining the fate of nations, establishing the power of economies and everything from assassinating world leaders to controlling Snapple. In this excerpt from the final chapter of his book, Callahan links biblical prophecies of the end times (the \"mark of the beast\" and all that) with modern global conspiracy theories that involve black helicopters, Hong Kong Gurkhas, militia, and the so-called \"New World Order\" which are supposed to signal that the end is nigh. (This excerpt can also be found in [ Skeptic magazine volume 4, number 3](https://www.skeptic.com/magazine/archives/vol04n03.html) from 1996.) The End of the World and the New World Order Black Helicopters, Hong Kong Gurkhas, Global Conspiracies & the Mark of the Beast by Tim Callahan As I write this introduction to the excerpt from my new book on [Bible Prophecy: Failure or Fulfillment?](https://www.skeptic.com/productlink/b048PB), the movie [Independence Day](https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/independence-day/id272967721?at=10l6ex) set a new record of $96 million gross on its opening weekend. The movie opens with a youthful technician in the SETI program headquarters checking the monitors for signs of extra terrestrial intelligence, while his boom box blasts the rock song \"It's the End of the World.\" For the erstwhile Earthlings in the movie it almost was the end of the world as the space aliens were not exactly the friendly types depicted in ET, [Close Encounters of the Third Kind](https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/close-encounters-third-kind/id270946850?at=10l6ex), and other Sci Fi blockbusters. Why are we so fascinated by \"end of the world\" stories? Sure, Independence Day owes some of its success to a huge marketing campaign that began on Superbowl Sunday seven months before (telling viewers this would be their last Super-bowl Sunday party); and to the spectacular special effects depicting the explosion of the Empire State Building, the White House, and other national monuments. But there is something deeper here, that goes to the heart of our psyche \u2014 the belief that one way or another we are doomed. Sci Fi authors and film producers are simply capitalizing on a theme that has been with us since biblical times. In [Skeptic, Vol. 3, #2](https://www.skeptic.com/magazine/archives/vol03n02.html), I wrote a review of Hal Lindsey's book Planet Earth \u2014 2000 A.D., in which I showed that as we approach the big millennium date doomsday warnings will proliferate in pop culture. Lindsey (like all doomsayers) was cautious, however, hedging his prediction with alternatives for 2007 or even 2048 (when he will be long gone), just in case 2000 comes and goes without incident. In my book I review all the major biblical prophecies, especially those concerned with the end times. Modern Technology & Other Signs of the End The Bible, especially the book of Revelation, is filled with allegorical stories and symbolic tales. The problem is in interpretation. Are these stories prophetic warnings for us, or social commentary for the readers of the time of their writing? Fundamentalists and conspiratorialists try desperately to stretch apocalyptic writings (that were about the politics of their time) to fit modern times. They also try to fit poetic pictures of destruction into modern technology. The most obvious of these is the idea that fire raining down from heaven means nuclear-armed missiles. Another is the idea that the phrase \"every eye shall see him\" (Rev. 1:7) refers to the return of Christ being seen worldwide on television. Hal Lindsey has speculated that the demonic locusts, the plague of the fifth trumpet, represent helicopters. Here is the actual description of the locusts from Rev. 9:7-10: In appearance the locusts were like horses arrayed for battle; on their heads were what looked like crowns of gold; their faces were like human faces, their hair like women's hair, and their teeth like lions' teeth; they had scales like iron breastplates, and the noise of their wings was like the noise of many chariots rushing into battle. They have tails like scorpions, and stings, and their power of hurting men for five months lies in their tails. In that their wings make a rushing noise, that helicopters could be said to look as if they have stinger-like tails, and that the locusts' armor could be said to be a description of the metal skin of helicopters, the locusts could be stretched to fit these modern machines, if one uses a good deal of imagination. Hal Lindsey apparently took the locusts with faces of men as being the crew of the helicopters as seen in the cock-pit from without. Just how it is that military helicopters would torture, but not kill, for five months is not explained. On the other hand, locusts commonly live for five months, and the prophet Joel's locusts were also like horses (see Joel 2:4-9). It is also hard to figure how they could have come out of the smoke from the bottomless pit (Rev 9:3) or why their king would be Abaddon, the angel of the bottomless pit (Rev. 9:11). Even if helicopters do not work that well in fulfilling the imagery of Revelation, they do figure in conspiracy theories. Listen to any fundamentalist radio station for a while and you will hear reports of ominous black (i.e. unmarked) helicopters harassing good conservative folks. Supposedly they were hovering over the Branch Davidian compound in Waco just before the tanks went in. People have claimed that the helicopters are often filled with men wearing unusual uniforms, hence the speculation that they are carrying foreign troops and that these are trial runs for the U.N. takeover of the U.S., eventually instituting the world government that will be ruled by the Antichrist. Among the people who claim to have been buzzed and harassed by low-flying black helicopters are Christians who are home-schooling their children to keep them out of the secular school system. Despite the popularity and availability of video cameras and despite reports of repeated harassment, none of these sightings have ever been substantiated. This last minor fact has not reduced the fears concerning the infernal machines in the least. If anything, the ability of the black helicopters to avoid detection has added to their satanic mystique. Another report of foreign troops being brought in to take away our rights was the assertion that the federal crime bill of 1994 had in it a provision for bringing in foreign police \u2014 specifically from Hong Kong \u2014 to enforce laws in America. The idea was that, unlike American cops, the foreigners would not have any compunction about firing on a crowd of American citizens. There was even one report that the police being brought over from Hong Kong were Gurkhas, troops with a legendary reputation for savagery. Reality was something else again. While there are about a thousand Gurkhas stationed in Hong Kong, they are used for border patrol only. Members of this elite corps of the British army are not so much noted for savagery, but rather are famous for their honesty, trustworthiness, sense of personal honor, and most of all for their valor. Since 1911 Gurkhas have won 13 Victoria Crosses, the British equivalent of the Congressional Medal of Honor. The likelihood that these elite troops, so fiercely loyal to the Queen, would be loaned out to the U.S. to kill Americans is nil. However, there is just the smallest grain of truth to the rumor that the government was going to bring in Hong Kong police. On page 843 of HR 3355, section 5108 directed the Attorney General, the heads of the FBI and the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), along with the Commissioners of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) and the Customs Service to recruit former Royal Hong Kong Police officers into Federal law enforcement positions. The true story is this. Hong Kong is shortly due to revert to the People's Republic of China. Thus, the officers of the Royal Police will soon be without either a job or a home. The fact that the INS was involved in the recruitment plan should tell anyone that these officers would be brought in as naturalized citizens. Since Hong Kong is an international port, its police are experienced in coping with black market goods and drug smuggling, hence the participation of the FBI, the DEA, and the Customs Service in the recruitment program. This is a far cry from bringing in foreign police for crowd control. In any case, this recruitment plan was dropped from the final version of the bill. Another horror story of the impending world government is that they have already subverted our money, planting occult symbols on dollar bills that hint at the drive to a globalist dictatorship. This was done during the (infamous) Roosevelt administration. The symbol in question is the pyramid with an eye on the back of the dollar bill. Below it is the Latin inscription Novus Ordo Seculorum, which translates as \"New World Order.\" Or does it? What we have here is a compound error made up of bad Latin, bad spelling, and poor history. Those readers who, like myself, took some Latin in high school, might remember that the suffix \"orum\" is the genitive plural for nouns in the second declension. Seculorum would have to be plural and mean \"of the worlds,\" which seems a rather clumsy phrasing. It certainly would be if in fact the word in question was \"seculorum.\" Actually, in their desire to read an apocalyptic conspiracy into our currency, the millenarian crowd has added the letter \"u\" between the \"c\" and the \"l\" of the word printed on the dollar, which is seclorum or \"of the ages.\" Thus, far Ordo Seclorum reads \"New Order of the Ages.\" Since this symbol and motto are on the back of our country's Great Seal and were put there when the nation was being founded, they represent the revolutionary sentiment that by dispensing with kings, whose rule was autocratic and based on force, and replacing that system with a republic based on reason, balance of powers, and self rule, the founders of our nation were creating a new order for the ages. Another phrase to be found on the back of the dollar bill, in fact one more prominently displayed than the Latin motto as well as being written in English is: \"In God We Trust.\" For some reason this phrase and its obvious implications seem to be consistently overlooked by conspiracy theorists. Other excursions into modern monetary subversion involve credit cards, bar codes, and other technologies that could potentially be a modern version of the Mark of the Beast. The most technologically sophisticated of these would be a computer microchip inserted under the skin either in the forehead or the back of the hand. Such technology is actually available and has been used to locate sheep and cattle grazing on range-lands. However, such solid state electronics are extremely vulnerable to electromagnetic fields, such as those generated by television screens. Sitting too near the boob-tube could erase the Mark of the Beast from many a couch potato. There are, of course, other technologies that suggest themselves as potential Marks of the Beast. Whole books have been written on how the bar code is a prelude to it. The cashless society is another concept that fits into the idea of having to take the mark if one would buy or sell. Thus, credit cards in general and Visa cards in particular are candidates for the Mark of the Beast. In the case of Visa cards, we have a dubious excursion into numerology, which should, like astrology and palmistry, be anathema to fundamentalist Christians. The basic scheme of numerology is that every letter in the alphabet is assigned a number from one to nine as follows: \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 A : B : C : D : E : F : G : H : I J : K : L : M : N : O : P : Q : R S : T : U : V : W : X : Y : Z Then the numbers of each word or name analyzed are added up. If a two or three digit number results, those numbers are added in a column until a number from 1 to 9 is reached. These nine numbers have specific psychological characteristics assigned to them, much as do the 12 signs of the Zodiac. Applying this system to the word VISA, we get the following 4+9+1+1=15 1+5=6 In the original numerological system, 6 stands for natural harmony as in the six colors of the spectrum. However, in order to make the Visa card come out as the Mark of the Beast, those fundamentalists who indulge in this sort of non-sense substitute biblical symbolism wherein 6 is the number of imperfection. Thus, by extrapolation, 6 means the same as 666. And voila! we have the Number of the Beast! (I will concede two items. First, while they do look for satanic conspiracies in many innocent aspects of the mundane world, very few fundamentalists involve themselves in interpretations as arcane as the numerological value of the Visa card. Second, the fear of some form of mandatory identification card and its misuse by a centralized government, even on the national level, is a reasonable one. While I like the convenience of my charge cards, untraceable cash transactions, which cannot be monitored by either a government or a corporation, constitute a democratically sound safeguard against intrusions into one's privacy. It is when these entirely valid concerns are linked to paranoid millennial fantasies that bizarre interpretations result. If we must interpret every universal identification system in apocalyptic terms, then every American citizen, upon being assigned a social security number, has taken the Mark of the Beast.) So far I have dealt with supposed symptoms of the satanic New World Order. Let us now look at the institutions millenarians and others of their ilk see as the movers behind this globalist conspiracy. Global Conspiracies Those who see the world in terms of a system under Satan's control, who see themselves \u2014 as many fundamentalists do \u2014 as being under siege, not only see a satanic pattern in world events of today, but see them as entrenched in history as well, particularly in the events of the twentieth century. They also see the Satanic conspiracy as having so pervasively infiltrated our system that virtually no one in power is untouched by it. For example, John McManus, present head of the John Birch Society, said that not only was the Reagan administration thoroughly infiltrated by agents of the New World Order, and the public brainwashed by the \"liberal media,\" but that William Bennett and Rush Limbaugh were both brainwashed by the New World Order (Live From L.A. KKLA November 29, 1993). Since not even Rush Limbaugh can be trusted, it is not surprising that McManus also pointed out that the heads of CBS, NBC, ABC, the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Los Angeles Times, the Wall Street Journal, Time, Newsweek, U.S. News and World Report, and the National Review are all members of the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), seen as one of the chief architects of the New World Order. Besides media heads, who else is a member of the CFR? According to Gary Kah in En Route to Global Occupation (as well as other sources), former and present members of the CFR include Adlai Stevenson, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Cyrus Vance, Zbigniew Brzezinski, Paul Volker, Lane Kirkland, Henry Kissinger, George Schultz, Nelson Rockefeller, David Rockefeller, Alan Greenspan, Jeanne Kirkpatrick, George Bush, Richard M. Nixon, George McGovern, Michael Dukakis, Donna Shalala, Richard Cheney, Colin Powell, Jimmy Carter, John F. Kennedy, Robert Kennedy, Edward Kennedy, Jesse Jackson, and many others. That people whose political beliefs cover such a broad spectrum are all members of the CFR should tell anyone that the organization, in actual fact, has no particular political leaning of its own. In short, the membership is too broad, varied, and extensive to be an indicator of any significance. Rather than revealing an entrenched conspiracy, this partial membership list indicates a prestigious organization that people prominent in politics, education, the media, and finance frequently join. Kah even admits that Dukakis only joined the CFR after his unsuccessful bid for the presidency. Other organizations high on the enemies list in this basic conspiracy scenario are the Trilateral Commission, the Club of Rome, the Bilderberg Group, and lesser organizations such as the Aspen Institute. All of these share with the CFR the qualities of being unofficial advisory bodies with distinguished membership rosters. Official government and international organizations in the supposed conspiracy include the Federal Reserve System (FRS) and, of course, the United Nations, the world government itself. Facts have little credibility in the minds of conspiracy addicts when it comes to the major players in their cherished scenario. That the UN is unable to control or bring into obedience one warlord whose clan controls one section of one third-world city would seem to make it a paper tiger. The same is true of the European Community, the other major contender for the role of Empire of the Antichrist. That the EC was either unable or unwilling to intervene effectively in Bosnia, its own back yard without American assistance, makes it a bit of a dud as the Neo-Roman Empire. Conspiracy theorists counter that the U.N. and the EC are allowing the conditions in Bosnia and Somalia to deteriorate for various reasons of their own, among them being a draconian program of population control. Of course, if either of these two institutions were to intervene effectively, these same theorists would use those events as evidence of the growing power of the UN and the EC. Thus, their belief is confirmed regardless of what happens, a sure sign of intellectual self-deception. As Michael Howard points out in his 1989 book [The Occult Conspiracy](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0892812516?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0892812516): \"Conspiracy theorists regard the UN with suspicion because of the alleged involvement of the CFR in its creation\" (Howard 1989, p. 167). The Council on Foreign Relations was formed when the United States failed to join the League of Nations, which had been set up after World War I chiefly by President Woodrow Wilson and his special advisor Col. E. M. House. In 1919 Col. House met with members of a British group called the Round Table that was the brain-child of 19th-century diamond and gold magnate, Cecil Rhodes. Rhodes was obsessed with the vision of a world government based on British values, and had set up the Round Table as a means toward that end. (This, of course, makes Rhodes scholars suspect as agents of the New World Order.) Members of the Round Table agreed to set up a non-governmental advisory body aimed at influencing nations toward peaceful resolution of conflicts. In England it was called the Institute for International Affairs (IIA); in America it became the CFR. An unofficial Anglo-American advisory group or think tank hardly fits the role of end-time bogey. However, the CFR does have a strong internationalist bent. In many ways the organization's lack of ideology has been used against it. As Howard puts it (p. 166): In the eyes of their opponents the CFR is currently dedicated to destroying the sovereignty of the United States, reversing the democratic process which instigated the 1776 American Revolution, promoting internationalism and the foundation of a world super state embracing both capitalism and Communism in a new political order. The evidence for this seems to be largely based on the neutral stance adopted by the CFR in American politics. Formerly, the CFR was viewed by its critics as being an elitist right-wing power group and was even accused of financing Hitler's rise to power. No support has ever been found for this claim. Next to the CFR, the Trilateral Commission is perhaps the most anathematized international advisory group in existence. Founded in 1970 and having a membership drawn from Japan, Europe, and North America, its stated goal is to \"encourage closer cooperation among these three democratic industrialized regions\" (item 15479, Encyclopedia of Associations, 1995). The Club of Rome has a broader appeal, being concerned with issues as varied as environmental degradation, overpopulation, economics, etc. The Bilderberg Group was originally founded in 1954 as an anti-Communist organization, but softened its stance in the wake of detente. All of these organizations have properties that lay them open to attack from the more paranoid among us. First of all, since they are composed of an international elite, there is the suspicion, no doubt somewhat justified, that their members think that they know better than the common man or woman how the world ought to be run. Second, since they often discuss sensitive issues, they often keep their meetings secret. This implies covert operations and clandestine plots. Third, given that all of these organizations wish to draw upon people influential in the worlds of finance, politics and media, there is considerable overlap of membership among them. This gives the appearance of an international conspiracy. Certainly the potential for elitism and conspiracy exists among these organizations, but the varied political views of the members would tend to act as a safeguard against such an occurrence. Howard gives this word of caution with regard to such organizations (p. 163): In general, as far as it can be detected at all by those who are directly in contact with its working, this influence can be characterized as benign. However, the unpalatable fact must also be faced that in some instances the pursuit and exercise of power in the political arena can have a corrupting effect, especially when it encounters the inherent weakness of human nature. Probably the greatest weakness of human nature seen in these organizations is in their inherent failure, because they are so much a part of the established system, to comprehend or anticipate what might variously be called novelty, chaos, or serendipity. As two examples of this failure to comprehend the curves thrown us by reality, consider that it was the professionals who got us into Vietnam. Consider also that the experts were caught just as flat-footed as the rest of us at the break-up of the Warsaw pact and the fall of the Soviet Union. The Federal Reserve System (FRS), along with any international banking system, is another source of paranoia for the conspiracy crowd. Any control or manipulation of the money supply is assumed to be part of a monetary conspiracy inimical both to individual freedom and national sovereignty. McManus has claimed that our national debt is being deliberately increased to put us in hock to international bankers as part of the plan to destroy our national sovereignty and create the New World Order. The FRS, or the Fed, created by congress in 1913, has the function of controlling the money supply, which it does by buying and selling government bonds, regulating the rate at which commercial banks borrow money from the Federal Reserve Bank, and regulating the requirements as to what percentage of commercial banks' assets are held in the Federal Reserve. If the Fed buys government bonds, reduces the discount rate to commercial banks, or lowers their Federal Reserve requirements, the money supply is increased, interest rates fall and inflation increases. When the Fed sells bonds, raises the discount rate or the Federal Reserve requirements, less money circulates, interest rates rise, and inflation is reduced. Obviously businesses are affected, often much against their will, by the policies of the Fed. Hence, it is not always well thought of, and among conspiracy theorists it has become viewed as an agent of the New World Order, this despite the fact that its present chairman, Alan Greenspan, was a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of the late Ayn Rand and is strongly influenced by Libertarian economic theory. Templars, Freemasons & the Dreaded Illuminati It is understandable that those who see the world as rushing to its final doom are likely to see any group urging international cooperation as being an instrument of the Antichrist. Instead of seeing the CFR and the Trilateral Commission as idealistic and somewhat elitist brain trusts, millenarians see them as a network of semi-secret societies wielding power illegitimately, not merely to influence but to control sovereign national governments. But whence came these powerful shadow regimes? Conspiracy theorists trace them all the way back to the Knights Templar, who, starting out as crusaders and protectors of pilgrims, supposedly fell under various influences including pagan mystery religions and the Assassins of Alamut. Having become corrupt and rich, the Templars tried to control the wealth of Europe but were valiantly stopped by Philip the Fair of France (1268-1314). Upon being put to the question the leaders of the Templars revealed that they worshiped a goat-headed idol called Baphomet, which they anointed with the blood of unbaptized babies, and that they ritually defiled crucifixes and practiced sodomy in their secret rites. Gary Kah and other conspiracy theorists report this story with evident relish. The Templars, after all, make wonderful foils. As the first internationalists whose wealth and banking system made them the creditors of and potential powers behind the governments of rising national states, they resemble the picture the theorists in their paranoia have painted of the CFR, the FRS, the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds. That they were secretly practicing satanic rites confirms the theorists in their assurance that their modern counterparts are part of the Kingdom of the Beast. All of us who grew up reading Sir Walter Scott's Ivanhoe are predisposed to believe the worst of the Templars from the start. After all, Bois-Gilbert and the other heavies in the classic were all Templars. But how much of this story is true? And how does it relate to modern times? The Templars were obviously quite powerful and somewhat corrupt. By the beginning of the 13th century, three crusading orders \u2014 the Templars, the Knights of St. John, and the Teutonic Knights \u2014 between them controlled 40% of Europe's frontiers and as such exerted considerable influence in the courts of Europe. The Templars made money by ferrying crusaders and pilgrims to the Holy Land and importing spices from there to Europe. As their wealth increased, they became the bankers of Europe and they became increasingly lax in fulfilling their religious vows. They conspired with the Sultan of Egypt to thwart Frederick II's crusade, and by 1254 were at open war with another crusading order, the Knights Hospitaler. When Acre, the last Christian stronghold in the Levant, fell to the Moslems in 1291 the Templars were expelled from the Holy Land. Now they were no longer even nominally crusaders. In 1307 Philip the Fair found himself facing bankruptcy and owed the Templars large sums of money. Thus, he made common cause with Pope Clement V to destroy the order, whose increasing wealth and independence were alarming the Church. The Grand Master of the Templars, Jacques de Molay, came to Paris that same year to discuss a new crusade. He was arrested, and Templar lodges and treasuries were seized throughout France. Pope Clement issued a bull ordering the arrest of all members of the order throughout Christendom. It was then that the Templars made their confessions either under torture or the threat of it. Considering that both the King of France and the Pope needed some criminal charge upon which to base the seizure of Templar treasuries, it is hardly surprising that the order was found to have become heretical. To this day it is unclear which charges if any made against the Templars were true. De Molay protested his innocence even as he was being burned at the stake in 1314. The significance of the Templars is that there is a link between them and Freemasonry. Late in the Middle Ages powerful craft guilds flourished in Europe. But, as the result in the decline in the building of new cathedrals and the subsequent drop in guild membership, the masons began to allow men not involved in the trade to join as honorary members. These men became known as \"free and accepted masons\" or Freemasons. In some countries, after the fall of the Templars their remnants were absorbed into the Masonic Guilds. Much of the medieval tradition, however, was embellished in the 17th and 18th centuries when the Freemasons adopted the rites and trappings of various chivalric orders. Though the organization is not specifically Christian, it began with a distinctly Protestant, anticlerical bias. The Templars, seen as prototypes of Protestant martyrs, were taken as a chivalric ideal to aspire to. So it is in modern times that the Masonic club for teenage boys is called the DeMolay, and the Knights Templar is one of the advanced lodges in Freemasonry. Without going into a detailed history of the Masons, let me just point out that their system of secret lodges allowed for open discussion of politics in countries where voicing one's opinion could result in imprisonment or death. In Latin countries Freemasonry tends to attract free thinkers and anticlericals. This fact plus the association of the Templars with the Masons has laid the latter open to all the charges leveled against the former, not only by fundamentalists but by European and South American dictators. In volume 22 of the [Encyclopedia Britannica](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SEKHJW?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000SEKHJW) the true significance of the Masonic lodges is mentioned in a discussion of the history of Italy in the late 1700s (p. 223): In the Italy of the old regime, there had been no representative political life. But the increase in the number of Masonic Lodges at the end of the 18th century demonstrated the desire for secret discussion of problems different from those that were agitating the academies and the agrarian societies. Not all the Freemasons became supporters of the Revolution and the French, but many of them did so. The moderate and constitutional demands of the Masonic Lodges began to be accompanied by more democratic demands, and there were in Milan, Bologna, Rome, and Naples cells of Illuminati, republican free-thinkers, after the pattern recently established in Bavaria by Adam Weishaupt. But were the Illuminati really such radicals? Indeed they were, and they were justly considered a threat by virtually every government in Europe. And what were the Illuminist beliefs that were so threatening to the governments of Weishaupt's day? Among them were such dangerous ideas as universal suffrage, equality of the sexes, and complete freedom of religion. Other Illuminist beliefs were of the utopian socialist variety. They included the abolition of social authority, private property and national states. Humanity, in the Illuminist vision, would live in anarchic harmony and universal brotherhood, and would enjoy peace and free love. This may make the Illuminati sound like a cross between Marxists and 1960s flower children, and is no doubt the image that so horrifies fundamentalist conspiracy theorists. But all such comparisons are doomed to error, because implicit in them is a disregard for historical context. To understand the Illuminati, one must understand the politics of Europe in the late 18th century, the time of the Enlightenment. In reaction to the excesses of the religious wars of the 1600s the intellectuals of the 1700s were rational, secular and anticlerical. The growth of science and rationalism provoked the thinkers of that day to question everything, and they found much that did not stand up well in the light of reason. Thus, in addition to being rational and secular, they were also democratic and egalitarian. And seeing the concentration of wealth and power in the hands of the nobility and the state religions, they considered the abolition of private property a necessary step to change what was clearly an unjust social order. Despite the prevalence of democratic ideals in the philosophy of the time, most of the states of Europe were ruled by kings who were absolute despots. (Remember that the American Revolution was just starting the year the Illuminati came into being.) These powers naturally resisted the democratic flow of their culture tenaciously, so tenaciously in fact that it took the rest of the 18th century, all of the 19th century, and part of the 20th to remove them. Thus it was not until late in the 1800s that the French were free of both the Bourbons and the descendants of Napoleon Bonaparte. It was not until the end of World War I that the Hohenzollerns of Prussia, the Hapsburgs of Austria, and the Romanovs of Russia were removed, and the empires of Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Turks broken up. Indeed, we are still today dealing with the aftermath of the persistence of these monarchies. As a graphic indication of how the battle lines were drawn, consider that as part of the Illuminist initiation ceremony the candidate was led into a room containing an empty throne, a crown, a scepter, and a sword, and was invited to take them up. But, he or she was told, if they did so they would be denied entry into the order. The crowned heads of Europe were not likely to take kindly to a secret society harboring such sentiments, nor were the established religious authorities. This, coupled with the anticlerical and anti-Christian bias of the Illuminati, made them even better foils than the Templars had been in the Middle Ages. Thus they were branded as atheists, Satanists, assassins and whatever else would feed a sensationalist, fear-mongering campaign. (I should point out that as Marxist as the abolition of property sounds, a variant of that principle \u2014 land redistribution \u2014 was practiced in America when, following the Revolution, the estates of Tories were seized, broken up, and given to landless families. Since most of the newly independent colonies still limited voting rights to property owners, this meant that the number of voters was increased significantly.) Are the Illuminati still active? Are they the unifying power behind the CFR, the Trilateral Commission, the Bilderbergers, and the Club of Rome? Are they the secret masters of worldwide Free masonry? For the most part the Illuminati were absorbed into other revolutionary groups. No doubt many joined the French Revolution or shifted in the 19th century from utopian socialism to Marxism. There is no evidence that they exist today. On the other hand the influence of Freemasonry is such that men holding to its ideals were instrumental in creating one of the 20th century's greatest powers, a power whose global influence and military might is greater than any known in the history of the world, a power viewed by many small nations as a distinct threat to their sovereignty. In fact, one of these nations has identified this power with Satan. This ominous power is the United States of America. Most of the founders of our nation, including George Washington, were Masons. Such was the influence of Freemasonry that the back of the Great Seal, that symbol on our dollar bill that so terrifies conspiracy theorists, contains the pyramid with an eye in it, which is a Masonic symbol. Humanists and New Agers Not only were most of the founding fathers Freemasons, at least one, Benjamin Franklin, was a Rosicrucian. The Rosicrucians were supposed to have access to the teachings of Christian Rosenkreuz, who was born in 1378 and lived for over 100 years. He had supposedly learned esoteric disciplines held by the ancient Egyptians, the Pythagorean philosophers of ancient Greece and other occult wisdom. In reality, the earliest Rosicrucian writings date from 1614. This secret fraternal order may actually have been founded by the Swiss physician and alchemist Paracelsus (1493?-1541). While it attracted many of the intelligentsia of the 18th century, the Rosicrucian order never seems to have developed as an organization of significant political influence to match the Freemasons. It was a common belief in the 18th-century that ancient civilizations had held secret knowledge lost to people of their day. To some degree this was true in that, for example, the technology to make large panes of clear glass, lost since the fall of the Roman Empire, was not rediscovered until the 1600s. The supposed esoteric knowledge of the Egyptians, however, was more the stuff of which the legends of Atlantis were made. Fraternal orders used supposed access to ancient hidden knowledge as a means of self-validation. The Masons claimed descent from the masons sent by Hiram of Tyre to build Solomon's Temple. Naturally, these Phoenician masons brought with them secrets of the ancient Egyptians. Thus, fraternal orders developed a quasi-pagan mythology as part of their ritual. Fundamentalists in general and conspiracy theorists in particular have seized on this, anathematized the Masons and Rosicrucians, and see in their rituals a pagan revival. Another pagan revival or intrusion of occult influences is that popular pastiche of westernized eastern religion, astrology, warmed over 19th-century mysticism (theosophy and the like), revived paganism of dubious validity and general feel-good spirituality called the New Age movement. Of course, the phrase \"New Age\" is too close to \"New World Order\" to not provoke fundamentalist paranoia. Both the pseudo-pagan rites of the Freemasons and the New Age movement excite millenarian fears as being the religion of the false prophet in Rev. 13:11-15. The facts that the New Age movement is patently silly, that the Rosicrucians have been reduced to soliciting new members through ads in pulp magazines, and that the mumbo-jumbo of Masonic ritual is nothing more than the usual hokum of fraternal societies have not blunted those fears in the least. And, since conspiracy theorists point out the great overlap in the ranks of professional politicians of Masons and members of the CFR, fears of the Illuminati are revived. As an example of how absurd such fears of a pervasive sub rosa paganism are, I can offer my experiences with Masonic organizations, indirect though they were. Out of filial duty I attended a number of officer installations as my parents moved up the ranks as members of the Garden Grove chapter of the Order of the Eastern Star, a Masonic organization for women and married couples. Having met the other members of the lodge and heard their political and social views, I can safely say that, as staunch Nixon supporters in the Vietnam War years, these people were not Illuminist, neo-pagan revolutionaries. It is common at these installations for the newly installed officers to introduce the friends and family members who have turned out to support them. Many of these are from other Masonic women's or couples' organizations, such as Daughters of the Nile or the Amaranth. Like the officers they had turned out to support, these women were quintessentially Orange County Republican. Thus, when one of the matrons introduced one of her friends as \"the High Priestess of my White Shrine,\" momentary visions of these ladies indulging in pagan rites and child sacrifice dissolved in the face of their obvious middle-class conservatism. What stretches credulity even further is the supposed link between New Agers and secular humanists, particularly since the latter generally hold the former in absolute contempt. The prime mechanism of indoctrination into this pagan/humanist world system is seen by millenarians and conspiracy theorists as being the public school system. The main tactics are seen as dumbing down students to make them manageable and desensitizing them to such horrors as infanticide. The system's chief architect is generally considered to be the late John Dewey, whom they hold responsible for modern failures in education. The problem with this view is that Dewey's model of permissive education hit its peak in the 40s and was dealt a death blow by the pressure to emphasize math and science at the expense of the humanities following the launch of the first Sputnik satellite in 1957. That the emphasis in science has not produced better educated students since then is a product of family breakdown, oversized classes, the encumbering of teachers with all sorts of baggage based on social agendas, the pervasive influence of television, and a host of other societal problems, none of which are demonstrably related to clandestine conspiracies. As an example of fundamentalist fears that children are being desensitized to such horrors as infanticide, consider a brief article by fundamentalist author Berit Kjos (pronounced Chos) that appeared in a magazine called Media Bypass. Kjos told of a mother who was trying to restrict the use of a novel called The Giver in the classroom because it contained a scene in which a low birth-weight baby is efficiently done away with. The mother felt that it desensitized children to infanticide. Kjos (1995) says of the book: Laura's mother knew that The Giver fit into the flood of classroom literature that force children to think the unthinkable and reconsider the values they learned at home. It also models many of the pitfalls and supposed perfections of the utopian school-centered community documented in Goals 2000 and other blueprints for change prepared by the educational establishment. And now for a dose of reality. I was so intrigued by Kjos's article that I went to the library and read The Giver, which was the winner of the 1994 Newbury Award. The novel is about a futuristic society which is seemingly utopian. As the story unfolds it becomes more and more evident that the society is quite sinister. Old people, incorrigibles and problem babies are \"released.\" Up to the point of the climactic scene which Laura's mother thought would desensitize kids to infanticide, \"release\" has by implication been a mystical letting go. When the hero actually views the \"release\" of a low birth-weight baby it turns out to be a horrific scene in which the baby is killed by lethal injection and disposed of down a garbage chute. Desensitizing? Hardly! The scene is traumatic. If anything it is likely to turn the kids into right-to-lifers. Laura and her classmates were required to make their own decisions as to whether the society portrayed in The Giver was right or wrong, though how they could think it right is a bit hard to figure. Fundamentalists object to such exercises. This is curious since they are the first to complain about \"dumbing down\" in the school system. One would think that exercises that make kids examine why they believe what they believe would be the opposite of dumbing down. Yet, when it comes right down to it fundamentalists want their children taught by rote. This is fine as far as it goes. Multiplication tables, rules of grammar and proper spelling can and should be laid out in black and white terms. But children also need to exercise their minds. And here is the rub. People can only be taught to think for themselves by questioning the validity of ideas. People who question invariably start questioning the Bible or at least how their parents and other authorities interpret it. Since children who question things may end up questioning their parents' premillennial beliefs, fundamentalists, when it comes right down to it, really do not want their kids to think. The Importance of Conspiracy Theories As part of the crisis that provokes the creation of a world government, Gary Kah sees the possibility of a Syrian attack on Israel, with a possible nuclear exchange as part of the hostilities. He cites the failed, or as he puts it, as yet unfulfilled prophecy of the destruction of Damascus in Is. 17:1 (that Damascus would be destroyed and never rebuilt) as possibly being fulfilled in this exchange, thereby validating both the prophecy and his scenario. That prophecies that clearly were not fulfilled are assumed to be awaiting fulfillment \u2014 some day \u2014 highlights the impossibility of falsification built into the fundamentalist scenario. There is in essence a basic dishonesty that pervades both millenarian prophecies and conspiracy theories. There may also be, among those who accuse the rest of us of being dupes or agents of a conspiracy, some hidden agenda of their own. Whether it is from sloppy research or sympathetic politics, Gary Kah has quoted extensively from so-called historian Nesta Webster to back up his assertion that the Illuminati/Freemasons are responsible for Marxism and everything else of evil in the world. Michael Howard says of Nesta Webster (1989, pp. 161-162): Typical of these politically motivated conspiracy theorists was Nesta Webster who wrote a series of best-selling books in the 1920s exposing the so-called Jewish world domination plan. She claimed that the Jews, working through secret societies and the international banking system, were the eminences grises behind the revolutionary movements of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries ... Webster believed she was the reincarnation of a countess who had been executed in the French Revolution and was convinced it was her duty in this lifetime to expose the secret societies who had plotted the 1789 uprising ... Webster revealed her true political colours in 1923. Her books had reviled Marxism as the modern cover for the \"Jewish menace\" and in that year she went a step further by joining the British Fascist Party.... That dishonesty which makes prophecy unfalsifiable and fails either by insufficient research or design to report the fascist anti-Semitism behind a cited author may not be entirely limited to that of an intellectual nature. It might well be cynically, cold-bloodedly monetary as well. While I cannot read the minds of those fostering millenarian fears and thus cannot absolutely prove a deliberate attempt to deceive on their part, there are ample motives that might lead them to fan millennial paranoia. Consider Hal Lindsey. According to the back cover of his book, Planet Earth \u2014 2000 A.D., he has authored 11 books. All of these are on the end-time and all are best-sellers in the Christian market. Their combined world-wide sales exceeds $35 million. In addition to this Lindsey has speaking tours, talk show appearances, etc. While I have no idea what portion of the sales go to him or how much of this money he devotes to charities, it is a sure bet that his celebrity status makes for a more attractive life than merely pastoring a local church would. Then there is Don McAlvany, editor of The McAlvany Intelligence Advisor, another conspiracy theorist who mixes stories of implanted biochips as the Mark of the Beast with ominous predictions of impending economic collapse. He advises his readers to buy gold and silver as a hedge against the coming disaster. Interestingly enough, McAlvany is a dealer in silver and gold. Could it be that that his financial interests are to some small degree shading his prophecies? While such end-times speculations as seeing the Mark of the Beast in the bar code, Visa cards, and implanted computer chips, or fears that Hong Kong Gurkhas will be imported into the U.S. for crowd control may seem harmless and rather silly, the avid adherence to the belief that these are the last days has serious consequences in that it motivates the way a sizable bloc of American voters views both domestic and foreign policy. In his book The Mind of the Bible-Believer, Edmund D. Cohen points out that it was extremely fortunate that the Soviet Union was run by atheists. Since they did not view the world as being fulfilled in an apocalyptic vision and did not believe that they had immortal souls that would survive a nuclear armageddon, they had a built-in reason to avoid an atomic war. Hal Lindsey has many times boasted that his lectures at places such as the Air Force Academy are always heavily attended and well received. Perhaps we should thank God that the Cold War ended before one of Lindsey's enthusiastic listeners pushed the nuclear envelope too far. Even with the end of the Cold War, there are consequences that voters holding the premillennial mind-set may plunge us into. Consider that their belief in the end-times has not been in the least bit shaken by the end of the Cold War and consider that the sweeping Republican electoral victories of 1994 were accomplished by a shift of only 2% of the voters coupled with a low voter turn-out. Since one of the voter blocs influencing that swing to the right consists of fundamentalist Christians looking forward to Armageddon, defense spending will likely not be based on rational considerations alone. Further, an aggressive, even bullying foreign policy could emerge, particularly in terms of our dealings with the Islamic nations and Russia. While the influence of premillennialists may well prove a windfall for defense contractors, it could easily have a disastrous effect on how the government deals with internal issues. Consider the example of the infamous James Watt. As Secretary of the Interior, it was his job to enforce environmental regulations. As a premillennialist, however, it was his belief that there was no point in defending the environment since the world was going to end soon and the whole thing would be destroyed anyway. There is no end to the number of problems this rationalization could be applied to. Why worry about the problems of homelessness or drug addiction? The world is going to end soon. Why bother using our taxes to fund vaccinating school children? The world is going to end soon. Why bother reforming injustices? The Lord is coming back to institute a perfect society in a few years at most. Particularly when the financial benefits of more defense spending and less emphasis on environmental and social programs fit so nicely with the eschatology of the pre-millennialist voters, we will see how destructive are the fantasies woven by Hal Lindsey and others of his ilk.

For Michael Shermer's daughter there were 6895 days (or just a shade under 18.9 years). The quantitative figure doesn't begin to capture the qualitative feeling of bonding that happens between a parent and a child during that time. In this week's Skepticblog, Michael Shermer explains his experience of empty nest syndrome with a little help from si muove is Italian for \"and yet it moves.\" These are perhaps the most famous words attributed to the Italian physicist, mathematician, astronomer and philosopher Galileo Galilei. While this quote makes for a dramatic climax to the story of Galileo's condemnation for heresy in 1633, there is no proof that the great scientist ever said it. This week on Skepticality, Swoopy talks with author Dan Hofstadter, whose book [The Earth Moves](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393338207?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0393338207) paints a unique picture not only of Galileo the heliocentrist, but also of Galileo the humanist. In this week's eSkeptic, we present the third in a series of classic historical pieces in skeptical and pseudoscience literature. Last week we presented William Jennings Bryan's never-delivered [Address to the Jury in the Scopes Case](https://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/10-10-06/). A couple weeks before that, we republished Benjamin Franklin's and Antoine Lavoisier's [investigation of Mesmerism](https://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/10-09-22/#feature) for King Louis XVI of France. And, this week, we present Robert W. Wood's famous letter that blew apart the chimerical search for n-rays, with an introduction by psychologist and skeptical investigator Terence Hines. A classic from skeptical history, this letter first appeared in Nature in 1904, republished here and in [Skeptic magazine volume 4, number 4](https://www.skeptic.com/magazine/archives/vol04n04.html) in 1996. What Ever Happened to n-Rays? by Terence Hines In early 1903, the news of the discovery of a new type of radiation in France spread through the international physics community. Rene Blondlot, one of the most famous physicists in the world, had made the discovery at the University of Nancy. He named the new radiation n-rays in honor of the university and city. The discovery of a new form of radiation was certainly not an unprecedented event at the start of the 20th century. Several other types of radiation had been reported in the dozen or so years previously (including x-rays). But none would be more controversial than n-rays. N-rays were supposedly a form of radiation exhibited by any number of substances, with the bizarre exceptions of green wood and \"anesthetized\" metal (metal soaked in ether or chloroform). Within less than a year of its announced \"discovery,\" no fewer than 30 papers were published confirming the existence of the new rays. Other laboratories, however, using more sophisticated methods were unable to replicate the findings. Blondlot's measuring instrument was a spectroscope with an aluminum-coated prism and thread on the inside. The n-rays were refracted by the prism and spread out into a spectrum. The only way to see the normally invisible n-rays was to cause them to hit a treated thread (e.g., one coated in calcium sulfide). Moving the thread across the gap between the prism and n-ray source caused the thread to become illuminated and this is what was reported as a \"detection\" (see illustration below for another way to \"detect\" n-rays). In 1903 Nature sent Johns Hopkins University physicist Robert W. Wood, who was attending a scientific conference in Britain, to Nancy, France, to investigate. During a series of experiments, when the lights were out, Wood secretly removed the prism from the spectroscope, after which n-rays were still detected, clearly an impossible result since the prism was supposedly critical for refracting the rays. In short, what Wood's little experiment proved was that n-rays didn't exist. Blondlot's use of a purely subjective methodology, as opposed to an objective one, led him to believe in the reality of the new rays, as it did in several other laboratories, mostly in France. (There may have been some nationalistic bias here since the Germans had discovered x-rays). Wood was an extraordinary individual whose wide-ranging areas of interest included many in physics, as well as non-traditional areas such as investigating spiritualistic mediums and the use of scientific methodology in crime detection. Following his visit to Blondlot's laboratory, Wood reported his findings in the September 29, 1904, issue of Nature, then, as it is today, one of the leading scientific publications in the world. This letter, reprinted here, is a classic in skeptical literature. After its appearance in Nature, it was quickly published in French in the Revue Scientifique (Vol. 2, Oct. 22, 1904, pp. 536-538) and in German in the Physikalische Zeitschrift (Vol. 1, 1904, pp. 789-791). The letter seems to have had quite an effect. According to M. Nye, whose excellent history of the n-ray affair should be consulted for further details (\"N-rays: An Episode in the History and Psychology of Science.\" Historical Studies in the Physical Sciences, 1980, 125-156), \"only one confirming account of n-rays was presented to the [French] Academy\" in the following years. Thus, Wood's letter signaled the beginning of the end of the n-ray episode. The debate would simmer on for a few more years and Blondlot, who retired in 1909, continued his n-ray quest, but to no avail. It is worth noting that nowhere in Wood's letter did he specify at which laboratory it was that he made his observations. But everyone in the field knew. The n-Rays by Robert W. Wood (Nature, September 29, 1904, 530-531) The inability of a large number of skillful experimental physicists to obtain any evidence whatever of the existence of the n-rays, and the continued publication of papers announcing new and still more remarkable properties of the rays, prompted me to pay a visit to one of the laboratories in which the apparently peculiar conditions necessary for the manifestation of this most elusive form of radiation appear to exist. I went, I must confess, in a doubting frame of mind, but with the hope that I might be convinced of the reality of the phenomena, the accounts of which have been read with so much scepticism. After spending three hours or more in witnessing various experiments, I am not only unable to report a single observation which appeared to indicate the existence of the rays, but left with a very firm conviction that the few experimenters who have obtained positive results have been in some way deluded. A somewhat detailed report of the experiments which was shown to me, together with my own observations, may be of interest to the many physicists who have spent days and weeks in fruitless efforts to repeat the remarkable experiments which have been described in the scientific journals of the past year. The first experiment which it was my privilege to witness was the supposed brightening of a small electric spark when the n-rays were concentrated on it by means of an aluminum lens. The spark was placed behind a small screen of ground glass to diffuse the light, the luminosity of which was supposed to change when the hand was interposed between the spark and the source of the n-rays. It was claimed that this was most distinctly noticeable, yet I was unable to detect the slightest change. This was explained as due to a lack of sensitiveness of my eyes, and to test the matter I suggested that the attempt be made to announce the exact moments at which I introduced my hand into the path of the rays, by observing the screen. In no case was a correct answer given, the screen being announced as bright and dark in alternation when my hand was held motionless in the path of the rays, while the fluctuations observed when I moved my hand bore no relation whatever to its movements. I was shown a number of photographs which showed the brightening of the image, and a plate was exposed in my presence, but they were made, it seems to me, under conditions which admit of many sources of error. In the first place, the brilliancy of the spark fluctuates all the time by an amount which I estimated at 25 percent, which alone would make accurate work impossible. Secondly, the two images (with n-rays and without) are built of \"installment exposures\" of five seconds each, the plate holder being shifted back and forth by hand every five seconds. It appears to me that it is quite possible that the difference in the brilliancy of the images is due to a cumulative favoring of the exposure of one of the images, which may be quite unconscious, but may be governed by the previous knowledge of the disposition of the apparatus. The claim is made that all accidents of this nature are made impossible by changing the conditions, i.e. by shifting the positions of the screens; but it must be remembered that the experimenter is aware of the change, and may be unconsciously influenced to hold the plate holder a fraction of a second longer on one side than on the other. I feel very sure that if a series of experiments were made jointly in this laboratory by the originator of the photographic experiments and Profs. Rubens and Lummer, whose failure to repeat them is well known, the source of the error would be found. I was next shown the experiment of the deviation of the rays by an aluminum prism. The aluminum lens was removed, and a screen of wet cardboard furnished with a vertical slit about 3 mm. wide put in its place. In front of the slit stood the prism, which was supposed not only to bend the sheet of rays, but to spread it out into a spectrum. The positions of the deviated rays were located by a narrow vertical line of phosphorescent paint, perhaps 0.5 mm. wide, on a piece of dry cardboard, which was moved along by means of a small driving engine. It was claimed that a movement of the screw corresponding to a motion of less than 0.1 of a millimeter was sufficient to cause the phosphorescent line to change in luminosity when it was moved across the n-ray spectrum, and this with a slit 2 or 3 mm. wide. I expressed surprise that a ray bundle 3 mm. in width could be split up into a spectrum with maxima and minima less than 0.1 of a millimeter apart, and was told that this was one of the inexplicable and astonishing properties of the rays. I was unable to see any change whatever in the brilliancy of the phosphorescent line as I moved it along, and I subsequently found that the removal of the prism (we were in a dark room) did not seem to interfere in any way with the location of the maxima and minima in the deviated (!) ray bundle. I then suggested that an attempt be made to determine by means of the phosphorescent screen whether I had placed the prism with its refracting edge to the right or the left, but neither the experimenter nor his assistant determined the position correctly in a single case (three trials were made). This failure was attributed to fatigue. I was next shown an experiment of a different nature. A small screen on which a number of circles had been painted with luminous paint was placed on the table in the dark room. The approach of a large steel file was supposed to alter the appearance of the spots, causing them to appear more distinct and less nebulous. I could see no change myself, though the phenomenon was described as open to no question, the change being very marked. Holding the file behind my back, I moved my arm slightly towards and away from the screen. The same changes were described by my colleague. A clock face in a dimly lighted room was believed to become much more distinct and brighter when the file was held before the eyes, owing to some peculiar effect which the rays emitted by the file exerted on the retina. I was unable to see the slightest change, though my colleague said that he could see the hands distinctly when he held the file near his eyes, while they were quite invisible when the file was removed. The room was dimly lit by a gas jet turned down low, which made blank experiments impossible. My colleague could see the change just as well when I held the file before his face, and the substitution of a piece of wood of the same size and shape as the file in no way interfered with the experiment. The substitution was of course unknown to the observer. I am obliged to confess that I left the laboratory with a distinct feeling of depression, not only having failed to see a single experiment of a convincing nature, but with the almost certain conviction that all the changes in the luminosity or distinctness of sparks and phosphorescent screens (which furnish the only evidence of n-rays) are purely imaginary. It seems strange that after a year's work on the subject not a single experiment has been devised which can in any way convince a critical observer that the rays exist at all. To be sure the photographs are offered as an objective proof of the effect of the rays upon the luminosity of the spark. The spark, however, varies greatly in intensity from moment to moment, and the manner in which the exposures are made appears to me to be especially favourable to the introduction of errors in the total time of exposure which each image receives. I am unwilling also to believe that a change of intensity which the average eye cannot detect when the n-rays are flashed \"on\" and \"off\" will be brought out as distinctly in photographs as is the case on the plates exhibited. Experiments could easily be devised which would settle the matter beyond all doubt; for example, the following: Let two screens be prepared, one composed of two sheets of thin aluminum with a few sheets of wet paper between, the whole hermetically sealed with wax along the edges. The other screen to be exactly the same, containing, however, dry paper. Let a dozen or more photographs be taken with the two screens, the person exposing the plates being ignorant of which screen was used in each case. One of the screens being opaque to n-rays, the other transparent, the resulting photographs would tell the story. Two observers would be required, one to change the screens and keep a record of the one used in each case, the other to expose the plates. The same screen should be used for two or three successive exposures, in one or more cases, and it should be made impossible for the person exposing the plates to know in any way whether a change had been made or not. I feel very sure that a day spent on some such experiment as this would show that variations in the density on the photographic plate had no connection with the screen used. Why cannot the experimenters who obtain results with n-rays and those who do not try a series of experiments together, as was done only last year by Cremieu and Pender, when doubt had been expressed about the reality of the Rowland effect? Readers interested in more information on Wood himself should consult his biography Doctor Wood: Modern Wizard of the Laboratory by William Seabrook, published in 1941. The 4 small illustrations to the right of Wood's portrait at the beginning of this article represent a few of Wood's wide ranging pursuits: (top to bottom) 1) Wood participated in many experiments in early aviation and took this photo in 1896 of aviation pioneer Otto Lilienthal's last successful flight. Wood is said to have tried the glider himself. 2) He wrote a best-selling book How to tell the Birds from the Flowers that lampooned contemporary nature books. 3) He invented and named the fish-eye camera, as well as pioneering many other photographic techniques such as infrared and ultraviolet photography. 4) Wood also found time to investigate leading psychics of his day, including Margery (pictured), and Eusapia Palladino. NEW ON MICHAELSHERMER.COM Can You Hear Me Now? Reports of a link between cell phones and cancer have periodically surfaced ever since cell phones became common appendages to people's heads in the 1990s. In Michael Shermer's October Scientific American column, he discusses how physics shows that it is virtually impossible for cell phones to cause cancer. NEW ON SKEPTICBLOG.ORG Touching History On Sunday, October 3, a group of skeptics gathered in Falls Church, Virginia to celebrate James Randi's 82nd birthday. Randi was joined by paranormal investigator Joe Nickell, Center for Inquiry founder Paul Kurtz, psychologist and magician Ray Hyman, magician Jamy Ian Swiss, JREF president D.J. Grothe, evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins, and many other skeptical luminaries from around the world. Michael Shermer had the opportunity to explore a private collection of some of the rarest books in the history of science, owned by a good friend of James Randi. Shermer shares that experience in Evidence for Evolution](https://www.skeptic.com/lectures/the-greatest-show-on-earth/) [Skeptic](https://www.skeptic.com/author/skeptic/)| Comments Off on The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution Richard Dawkins, discussing his book [The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution](https://shop.skeptic.com/greatest-show-on-earth-by-richard-dawkins), begins by explaining that all of his previous books na\u00efvely assumed the fact of evolution, which meant that he never got around to laying out the evidence that evolution is true. Dawkins also came to realize that a disturbingly large percentage of the American and British public didn't share his enthusiasm for evolution. In fact, they actively abhorred the idea, since it seemed to contradict the Bible and diminish the role of God. So Dawkins decided to write a book for these history-deniers, in which he would dispassionately demonstrate the truth of evolution beyond sane, informed, intelligent doubt. If Charles Darwin walked into a 21st-century bookstore and wanted to know how his theory had fared, this is the book he should pick up. As Darwin famously noted, \"There is grandeur in this view of life.\" What Dawkins demonstrates is that this view of life isn't just grand: it's also undeniably true. last speech (never delivered) for the Scopes' Monkey Trial in 1925 was reprinted the next year as a pamphlet: a tool for believers to combat what they perceived to be a cultural threat \u2014 the theory of evolution. He deemed it \"the most powerful argument against evolution ever made.\" In this week's eSkeptic, we present the speech which we also printed in [Skeptic magazine volume 4, number 2](https://www.skeptic.com/magazine/archives/vol04n02.html) in 1996. Mr. Bryan's Address to the Jury in the Scopes' Case The Speech Which Was Never Delivered by William Jennings Bryan May it please the court, and gentlemen of the jury: Demosthenes, the greatest of ancient orators, in his \"oration on the crown,\" the most famous of his speeches, began by supplicating the favor of all the gods and goddesses of Greece. If, in a case which involved only his own fame and fate, he felt justified in petitioning the heathen gods of his country, surely we, who deal with the momentous issues involved in this case, may well pray to the ruler of the universe for wisdom to guide us in the performance of our several parts in this historic trial. Let me in the first place, congratulate our cause that circumstances have committed the trial to a community like this and entrusted the decision to a jury made up largely of the yeomanry of the state. The book in issue in this trial contains on its first page two pictures contrasting the disturbing noises of a great city with the calm serenity of the country. It is a tribute that rural life has fully earned. I appreciate the sturdy honesty and independence of these who come into daily contact with the earth, who living near to nature, worship nature's god and who, dealing with the myriad mysteries of earth and air, seek to learn from revelation about the Bible's wonder working God. I admire the stern virtues, the vigilance and the patriotism of the class from which the jury is drawn, and am reminded of the lines of Scotland's immortal bard, which, when changed but slightly, describe your country's confidence in you: O, Scotia, my dear, my native soil! For whom my warmest wish to heaven is sent, Long may thy hardy sons of rustic toil be blest with health, and peace, and sweet content. And, Oh, may heaven their simple lives present From luxury's contagion, weak and vile Then, howe'er crowns and coronets be rent A virtuous populace may rise the while, And stand, a wall of fire, around their much loved isle. Let us now separate the issues from the misrepresentations, intentional and unintentional, that have obscured both the letter and the purpose of the law. This is not an interference with freedom of conscience. A teacher can think as he pleases and worship God as he likes, or refuse to worship God at all. He can believe in the Bible or discard it; he can accept Christ or reject him. This law places no objections or restraints upon him. And so with freedom of speech, he can, so long as he acts as an individual, say anything he likes on any subject. This law does not violate any rights guaranteed by any constitution to any individual. It deals with the defendant, not as an individual, but as an employee, an official or public servant, paid by the state, and therefore under instructions from the state. The right of the state to control the public schools is affirmed in the recent decision in the Oregon case, which declares that the state can direct what shall be taught and also forbid the teaching of anything \"manifestly inimical to the public welfare.\" The above decision goes even farther and declares that the parent not only has the right to guard the religious welfare of the child, but is in duty bound to guard it. That decision fits this case exactly. The state had a right to pass this law, and the law represents the determination of the parents to guard the religious welfare of their children. It need hardly be added that this law did not have its origin in bigotry. It is not trying to force any form of religion on anybody. The majority is not trying to establish a religion or to teach it \u2014 it is trying to protect itself from the efforts of an insolent minority to force irreligion upon the children under the guise of teaching science. What right has a little irresponsible oligarchy of self-styled \"intellectuals\" to demand control of the schools of the United States, in which 25,000,000 of children are being educated at an annual expense of nearly $2,000,000,000? Christians must, in every state of the union, build their own colleges in which to teach Christianity; it is only simple justice that atheists, agnostics and unbelievers should build their own colleges if they want to teach their own religious views or attack the religious views of others. The statute is brief and free from ambiguity. It prohibits the teaching, in the public schools, of \"any theology that denies the story of divine creation as taught in the Bible,\" and teaches, \"instead, that man descended from a lower order of animals.\" The first sentence sets forth the purpose of those who passed the law. They forbid the teaching of any evolutionary theory that disputes the Bible record of man's creation and, to make sure that there shall be no misunderstanding, they place their own interpretation on their language and specifically forbid the teaching of any theory that makes man a descendant of any lower form of life. The evidence shows that defendant taught, in his own language as well as from a book outlining the theory, that man descended from lower forms of life. Howard Morgan's testimony gives us a definition of evolution that will become known throughout the world as this case is discussed. Howard, a 14-year-old boy, has translated the words of the teacher and the textbook into language that even a child can understand. As he recollects it, the defendant said \"a little germ of one cell organism has formed in the sea; this kept evolving until it got to be a pretty good sized animal, then came on to be a land animal, and it kept evolving, and from this was man.\" There is no room for difference of opinion here, and there is no need of expert testimony. Here are the facts, corroborated by another student, Harry Helton, and admitted to be true by counsel for defense. White, superintendent of schools, testified to the use of Hunter's civic biology, and to the fact that the defendant not only admitted teaching evolution, but declared that he could not teach it without violating the law. Robinson, the chairman of the school board, corroborated the testimony of Superintendent White in regard to the defendant's admissions and declaration. These are the facts; they are sufficient and undisputed; a verdict of guilty must follow. But the importance of this case requires more. The facts and arguments presented to you must not only convince you of the justice of conviction in this case, but, while not necessary to a verdict of guilty, they should convince you of the righteousness of the purpose of the people of the state in the enactment of this law. The state must speak through you to the outside world and repel the aspersions cast by the counsel for the defense upon the intelligence and the enlightenment of the citizens of Tennessee. The people of this state have a high appreciation of the value of education. The state constitution testifies to that in its demand that education shall be fostered and that science and literature shall be cherished. The continuing and increasing appropriations for public instruction furnish abundant proof that Tennessee places a just estimate upon the learning that is secured in its schools. Religion is not hostile to learning; Christianity has been the greatest patron learning has ever had. But Christians know that \"the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.'' Now, just as it has been in the past, and they therefore oppose the teaching of guesses that encourage Godlessness among the students. Neither does Tennessee undervalue the service rendered by science. The Christian men and women of Tennessee know how deeply mankind is indebted to science for benefits conferred by the discovery of the laws of nature and by the designing of machinery for the utilization of these laws. Give science a fact and it is not only invincible, but it is of incalculable service to man. If one is entitled to draw from society in proportion to the service that he renders to society, who is able to estimate the reward earned by those who have given to us the use of steam, the use of electricity, and enable us to utilize the weight of water that flows down the mountainside? Who will estimate the value of the service rendered by those who invented the radio? Or, to come more closely to our home life, how shall we recompense those who gave us the sewing machine, the tractor, the threshing machine, the tractor, the automobile and the method now employed in making artificial ice? The department of medicine also opens an unlimited field for invaluable service. Typhoid and yellow fever are not feared as they once were. Diphtheria and pneumonia have been robbed of some of their terrors, and a high place on the scroll of fame still awaits the discoverer of remedies for arthritis, cancer, tuberculosis and other dread diseases to which mankind is heir. Christianity welcomes truth from whatever source it comes, and is not afraid that any truth from any source can interfere with the divine truth that comes by inspiration from God Himself. It is not scientific truth to which Christians, therefore, can be scientific unless it is true. Evolution is not truth; it is merely an hypothesis \u2014 is millions of guesses strung together. It had not been proven in the day of Darwin; he expressed astonishment that with two or three million species, it had been impossible to trace any species to any other species. It had not been proven in the days of Huxley, and it has not been proven up to today. It is less than four years ago that Professor Bateson came all the way from London to Canada to tell the American scientists that every effort to trace one species to another had failed \u2014 every one. He said he still had faith in evolution, but had doubts about the origin of species. But of what value is evolution, if it cannot explain the origin of species? While many scientists accept evolution as if it were a fact, they all admit, when questioned, that no explanation has been found as to how one species developed into another. Darwin suggested two laws, sexual selection, and natural selection. Sexual selection has been laughed out of the class room, and natural selection is being abandoned, and no new explanation is satisfactory even to scientists. Some of the more rash advocates of evolution are wont to say that evolution is as firmly established as the law of gravitation, or the Copernican theory. The absurdity of such a claim is apparent when we remember that anyone can prove the law of gravitation by throwing a weight into the air, and that anyone can prove the roundness of the earth by going around it, while no one can prove evolution to be true in any way whatever. Chemistry is an insurmountable obstacle in the path of evolution. It is one of the greatest of the sciences; it separates the atoms \u2014 isolates them and walks about them so to speak. If there were in nature a progressive force, an eternal urge, chemistry would find it. But it is not there. All of the 92 original elements are separate and distinct; they combine in fixed and permanent proportions. Water is H2O, as it has been from the beginning. It was here before life appeared and has never changed; neither can it be shown that anything else has materially changed. Man A Special Creation There is no more reason to believe that man descended from some inferior animal than there is to believe that a stately mansion had descended from a small cottage. Resemblances are not proof, they simply put us on inquiry. As one fact, such as the absence of the accused from the scene of the murder, outweighs all resemblances that a thousand witnesses could swear to, so the inability of science to trace any one of the millions of species to another species, outweighs all the resemblances upon which evolutionists rely to establish man's blood relationship with the brutes. But while the wisest scientists can not prove a pushing power, such as evolution is supposed to be, there is a lifting power that any child can understand. The plant lifts the mineral up into a higher world, and the animal lifts the plants up into a world still higher. So, it has been reasoned by analogy, man rises, not by a power within him, but only when drawn upward by a higher power. There is a spiritual gravitation that draws all souls toward heaven, just as surely as there is a physical force that draws all matters on the surface of the earth towards the earth's center. Christ is our drawing power; he said, \"I, if I be lifted from the earth, will draw all men unto Me,\" and his promise is being fulfilled daily all over the world. It must be remembered that the law under consideration in this case does not prohibit the teaching of evolution up to the line that separates man from the lower form of animal. The law might well have gone farther than it does and prohibit the teaching of evolution in lower forms of life; the law is a very conservative statement of the peoples' opposition to an anti-Biblical hypothesis. The defendant was not content to teach what the law permitted; he, for reasons of his own, persisted in teaching that which was forbidden for reasons entirely satisfactory to the law makers. Many of the people who believe in evolution do not know what evolution means. One of the science books taught in the Dayton high schools has a chapter on \"The Evolution of Machinery.\" This is a very common misuse of the term. People speak of the evolution of the telephone, the automobile, and the musical instrument. But these are merely illustrations of man's power to deal intelligently with inanimate matter; there is no growth from within in the development of machinery. Equally improper is the use of the word \"evolution\" to describe the growth of a plant from a seed, the growth of a chicken from an egg, or the development of any form of animal life from a single cell. All these give us a circle, not a change from one species to another. Evolution \u2014 the evolution involved in this case, and the only evolution that is a matter of controversy anywhere \u2014 is the evolution taught by defendant, set forth in the books now prohibited by the new state law, and illustrated in the diagram printed on page 194 of [Hunter's Civic Biology](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1154664333?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1154664333). The author estimates the number of species in the animal kingdom at 518,900. These are then divided into 18 classes, and each class indicated on the diagram by a circle, proportioned in size to the number of species in each class and attached by a stem to the trunk of the tree. It begins at protozoa and ends with mammals. Passing over the classes with which the average man is unfamiliar, let me call your attention to a few of the larger and better known groups. The insects are numbered at 360,000, over two-thirds of the total number of species in the animal world. The fishes are numbered at 13,000, the amphibians at 1,400, the reptiles at 3,500, and the birds at 13,000, while 3,500 mammals are crowded together in a little circle that is barely higher than the bird circle. No circle is reserved for man alone. He is, according to the diagram, shut up in the little circle entitled \"mammals,\" with 3,499 other species of mammals. Does it not seem a little unfair not to distinguish between man and lower forms of life? What shall we say of the intelligence, not to say religion of those who are so particular to distinguish between fishes and reptiles and birds, but put a man with an immortal soul in the same circle with the wolf, the hyena, and the skunk? What must be the impressions made upon children by such a degradation of man? In the preface of this book, the author explains that it is for children, and adds that \"the boy or girl of average ability upon admission to the secondary school is not a thinking individual.\" Whatever may be said in favor of teaching evolution to adults, it surely is not proper to teach it to children who are not yet able to think. The evolutionist does not undertake to tell us how protozoa, moved by interior and resident forces, sent life up through all the various species, and can not prove that there was actually any such compelling power at all. And yet, the school children are asked to accept their guesses and build a philosophy of life upon them. If it were not so serious a matter, one might be tempted to speculate upon the various degrees of relationship that, according to evolutionists, exists between man and other forms of life. It might require some very nice calculation to determine at what degree of relationship the killing of a relative ceases to be murder and the eating of one's kin ceases to be cannibalism. But it is not a laughing matter when one considers that evolution not only offers no suggestion as to a creator but tends to put the creative act so far away to cast doubt upon creation itself. And, while it is shaking faith in God as a beginning, it is also creating doubt as to heaven at the end of life. Evolutionists do not feel that it is incumbent upon them to show how life began or at what point, in their long drawn out scheme of changing species man became endowed with hope and promise of immortal life. God may be a matter of indifference to the evolutionists, and a life beyond may have no charm for them, but the mass of mankind will continue to worship their Creator and continue to find comfort in the promise of their Saviour that he has gone to prepare a place for them. Christ has made of death a narrow, starlit strip between the companionship of yesterday and the reunion of tomorrow, and evolution strikes out the stars and deepens the gloom that enshrouds the tomb. If the results of evolution were unimportant, one might require less proof in support of the hypothesis, but before accepting a new philosophy of life, built upon a materialistic foundation, we have reason to demand something more than guess; \"we may well suppose\" is not a sufficient substitute for \"thus saith the Lord.\" If you, your honor, and you, gentlemen of the jury would have an understanding of the sentiment that lies back of the statute against the teaching of evolution, please consider these facts: First, as to the animals to which evolutionists would have us trace our ancestry. The following is Darwin's family tree, as you will find it set forth on pages 180-181 of his \" [Descent of Man](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0814720641?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0814720641).\" \"The most ancient progenitors in the kingdom of vertebrata, at which we are able to obtain an obscure glance, apparently consisted of a group of marine animals, resembling the larvae of existing asidians. These animals probably gave rise to a group of fishes, as lowly organized as the lancelot; and from these the canoids, and other fishes like the lepidosiren, must have been developed. From such fish a very small advance would carry us on to the amphibians. We have seen that birds and reptiles were once intimately connected together; and the monotrematata now connect mammals with reptiles in a slight degree. But no one can at present say by what line of descent the three higher and related classes, namely, mammals, birds and reptiles, were derived from the two lower vertebrate classes, namely, amphibians and fishes. In the class of mammals the steps are not difficult to conceive which led from the ancient monotremata to the ancient marsupials; and from these to the early progenitors of the placental mammals. We may thus ascend to the lemuridae; and the interval is not very wide from these to the simiadac. The simiadae then branched off into two great stems, the new world and the old world monkeys; and from the latter, at a remote period, man, the wonder and glory of the universe, proceeded. Thus we have given to man a pedigree of prodigious length, but not, it may be said, of noble quality.\" Darwin, on page 171 of the same book, tries to locate his first man, that is, the first man to come down out of the trees, in Africa. After leaving man in company with gorillas and chimpanzees, he says: \"But it is useless to speculate on this subject.\" If he had only thought of this earlier, the world might have been spared much of the speculation that his brute hypothesis has excited. On page 79 Darwin gives some fanciful reasons for believing that man is more likely to have descended from the chimpanzee than from the gorilla. His speculations are an excellent illustration of the effect that the evolutionary hypothesis has in cultivating the imagination. Professor J. Arthur Thomson says that the \"idea of evolution is the most potent thought economizing formula the world has yet known.\" It is more than that; it dispenses with thinking entirely and relies on the imagination. On page 141 Darwin attempts to trace the mind of man back to the mind of lower animals. On page 118 and 114 he endeavors to trace man's moral nature back to the animals. It is all animal, animal, animal, with never a thought of God or religion. Our first indictment against evolution is that it disputes the truth of the Bible account of man's creation and shakes faith in the Bible as the word of God. This indictment we prove by comparing the process described as evolutionary with the text Genesis. It not only contradicts the Mosaic record as to the beginning of human life, but it disputes the Bible doctrines of reproduction according to kin \u2014 the greatest scientific principle known. Evolution Incompatible With Faith Our second indictment is that the evolutionary hypothesis carried to its logical conclusion, disputes every vital truth of the Bible. Its tendency, naturally, if not inevitably, is to lead those who really accept it, first to agnosticism and then to atheism. Evolutionists attack the truth of the Bible, not openly at first, but by using weasel-words like \"poetical,\" \"symbolical,\" and \"allegorical\" to search out the meaning of the inspired record of man's creation. We call as our first witness Charles Darwin. He began life as a Christian. On page 39, volume l, of the life and letters of Charles Darwin, by his son, Francis Darwin, he says, speaking of the period of 1828 to 1831. \"I did not then in the least doubt the strict and literal truth of every word in the Bible.\" On page 412 of volume 2, of the same publication, he says, \"when I was collecting facts for 'The Origin' my belief in what is called a personal God was firm as that of Doctor Puzey himself.\" It may be a surprise to your honor, and to you, gentlemen of the jury, as it was to me, to learn that Darwin spent three years at Cambridge studying for the ministry. This was Darwin as a young man, before he came under the influence of doctrine that man was from a lower order of animals. The change wrought in his religious views will be found in a letter written to a German youth in 1879, and printed on page 277 of volume 1 of the life and letters above referred to. The letter begins: \"I am much engaged, an old man, and out of health, and I can not spare time to answer your questions fully, nor indeed can they be answered. Science has nothing to do with Christ, except insofar as the habit of scientific research makes a man cautious in admitting evidence. For myself, I do not believe that there ever has been any revelation. As for a future life, every man must judge for himself between conflicting vague probabilities.\" Note that \"science has nothing to do with Christ, except insofar as the habit of scientific research makes a man cautious in admitting evidence,\" stated plainly, that simply means that \"the habit of scientific research\" makes one cautious in accepting the only evidence that we have of Christ's existence, mission, teaching, crucifixion, and resurrection, namely the evidence found in the Bible. To make this interpretation of his words the only possible one, he adds \"for myself, I do not believe that there ever has been any revelation.\" In rejecting the Bible as a revelation from God he rejects the Bible's conception of God, and he rejects also the supernatural Christ of whom the Bible, and the Bible alone, tells. And, it will be observed, he refuses to express any opinion as to a future life. Now let us follow with his son's exposition of his father's views as they are given in extracts from a biography written in 1876. Here is Darwin's language as quoted by his son: \"During these two years (October, 1838, to January, 1839) I was led to think much about religion. Whilst on board the Beagle I was quite orthodox, and I remember being heartily laughed at by several of the officers (though themselves orthodox) for quoting the Bible as an unanswerable authority on some point of morality. When thus reflecting I felt compelled to look for a first cause, having an intelligent mind, in some degree analogous to man; and I deserved to be called an atheist. This conclusion was strong in my mind about the time, as far as I can remember, when I wrote the 'Origin of Species.' It is since that time that it has very gradually, with many fluctuations, become weaker. Then arises the doubt, can the mind of man, which has, as I fully believe, been developed from a mind as low as that possessed by the lowest animals, be trusted when it draws such grand conclusions? \"I can not pretend to throw the least light on such abstruse problems. The mystery of the beginning of all things is insolvable by us; and I, for one, must be content to remain an agnostic.\" When Darwin entered upon his scientific career he was \"quite orthodox and quoted the Bible as an unanswerable authority on some point of morality.\" Even when he wrote \"Origin of Species,\" the thought of \"a first cause, having an intelligent mind, in some degree analogous to man,\" was strong in his mind. It was after that time that \"very gradually, with many fluctuations, his belief in God became weaker.\" He traces this decline for us and concludes by telling us that he can not pretend to throw the least light on such abstruse problems \u2014 the religious problems above referred to. Then comes the flat statement that he \"must be content to remain an agnostic,\" and, to make clear what he means by the word agnostic, he says that \"the mystery of the beginning of all things is insolvable by us\" \u2014 not by him alone but by everybody. Here we have the effect of evolution upon its most distinguished exponent; it led him from an orthodox Christian, believing every word of the Bible and in a personal God, down and down to helpless and hopeless agnosticism. But there is one sentence upon which I reserve comment \u2014 it throws light upon its downward pathway: \"Then arises the doubt, can the mind of man, which has, as I fully believe, been developed from a mind as low as that possessed by the lowest animals, be trusted when it draws such grand conclusions?\" Here is the explanation; he drags man down to the brute levels, and then, judging man by brute standards he questions \"'whether man's mind can be trusted to deal with God and immortality.'\" How can any teacher tell his students that evolution does not tend to destroy his religious faith? How can an honest teacher conceal from his students the effect of evolution upon Darwin himself ? And is it not stranger still that preachers who advocate evolution never speak of Darwin's loss of faith, due to his belief in evolution? The parents of Tennessee have reason enough to fear the effect of evolution upon the mind of their children. Belief in evolution can not bring to those who hold such a belief any compensation for the loss of faith in God, trust in the Bible and belief in the supernatural character of Christ. It is belief in evolution that has caused so many scientists and so many Christians to reject the miracles of the Bible, and then give up, one after another, every vital trust in Christianity. They finally cease to pray and sunder the tie that binds them to their Heavenly Father. The miracle should not be a stumbling block to anyone. It raises but three questions: First, could God perform a miracle? Yes, the God who created the universe can do anything he wants to do with it. He can temporarily suspend any law that he has made or he may employ higher laws that we do not understand. Second: Would God perform a miracle? To answer that question in the negative one would have to know more about God's plans and purposes than a finite mind can know and yet some are so wedded to evolution that they deny that God would perform a miracle merely because a miracle is inconsistent with evolution. If we believe that God can perform a miracle and might desire to do so, we are prepared to consider with open mind the third question, namely: Did God perform the miracles recorded in the Bible? The same evidence that establishes the authority of the Bible establishes the truth of miracles performed. Now let me read of one of the most pathetic confessions that has come to my notice. George John Romanes, a distinguished biologist, sometimes called the successor of Darwin, like Darwin, was reared in the orthodox faith, and like Darwin, was led away from it by evolution. For 25 years he could not pray. Soon after he became an agnostic, he wrote a book entitled, \" [A Candid Examination of Theism](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1103429906?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1103429906),\" publishing it under the assumed name \"Physicus.\" In his book he says: \"And for so much as I am far from being able to agree with those who affirm that the twilight doctrine in the 'new faith' is a desirable substitute for the waning splendor of 'the old' I am not ashamed to confess that with this virtual negation of God the universe to me has lost its soul of loveliness; and although from hence the precept 'work while it is day' will doubtless but gain an intensified force from the terribly intensified meaning of the words that 'the night cometh when no man can work,' yet when at times I think, as think at times I must, of the appalling contrast between the hallowed glory of that creed which once was mine, and the lonely mystery of existence as now I find it \u2014 at such times I shall ever feel it impossible to avoid the sharpest pang of which my nature is susceptible.\" Do these evolutionists stop to think of the crime they commit when they take faith out of the hearts of men and women and lead them out into a starless night? What pleasure can they find in robbing a human being of \"the hallowed glory of that creed\" that Romanes once cherished, and in substituting the \"lonely mystery of existence\" as he found it? Can the fathers and mothers of Tennessee be blamed for trying to protect their children from such a tragedy? If any one has been led to complain of the severity of the punishment that hangs over the defendant, let him compare this crime and its mild punishment with the crimes for which a greater punishment is ascribed. What is the taking of a few dollars from one in day or night in comparison with the crime of leading one away from God and away from Christ? He who spake as never man spake, thus describes the crimes that are committed against the young: \"It is impossible but that offenses will come: but woe unto him through whom they come. It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and he be cast into the sea than he should offend one of these little ones.\" Christ did not overdraw the picture. Who is able to set a price upon the life of a child \u2014 a child into whom a mother poured her life and for whom a father has labored? What may a noble life mean to the child itself, to the parents and to the world? And, it must be remembered that we can measure the effect on only that part of life which is spent on earth; we have no way of calculating the effect on that infinite circle of life which existence here is but a small arc. The soul is immortal and religion deals with the soul; the logical effect of the evolutionary hypothesis is to undermine religion and thus affect the soul. I recently received a list of questions that were to be discussed in a prominent eastern school for women. The second question in the list read: \"Is religion an obsolescent function that should be allowed to atrophy quietly, without arousing the passionate prejudice of outworn superstitions?\" The real attack of evolution, it will be seen, is not upon orthodox Christianity or even upon Christianity, but upon religion \u2014 the most basic fact in man's existence and the most practical thing in life. James H. Leuba, a professor of psychology at Bryn Mawr college, Pennsylvania, published a few years ago a book entitled, \"Belief in God and Immortality.\" In this book he relates how he secured the opinions of scientists as to the existence of a personal God and a personal immortality. He issued a volume entitled, \"American Men of Science,\" which he says, included the names of \"practically every American who may properly be called a scientist.\" There are 5,500 names in the book. He selected 1,000 names as representative of the 5,500, and addressed them personally. Most of them, he said, were teachers in schools of higher learning. The names were kept confidential. Upon the answer received, he asserts that over half of them doubt or deny the existence of a personal God and a personal immortality, and he asserts that unbelief being greatest among the most prominent. Among biologists, believers in a personal God numbered less than 31 percent while unbelievers in a personal immortality numbered only 37 percent. He also questioned the students in nine colleges of high rank and from 1,000 answers received, 97 per cent of which were from students between 18 and 20, he found that unbelief increased from 15 per cent in the Freshman class up to 40 to 45 per cent among the men who graduated. On page 280 of this book, we read \"the students' statistics show that young people enter college, possessed of the beliefs still accepted, more or less perfunctorily, in the average home of the land, and gradually abandon the cardinal Christian beliefs.\" This change from belief to unbelief he attributed to the influence of the persons \"of high culture under whom they studied.\" The people of Tennessee have been patient enough; they acted none too soon. How can they expect to protect society, and even the church, from the deadening influence of agnosticism and atheism if they permit the teachers employed by taxation to poison the mind of the youth with this destructive doctrine? And remember, that the law has not heretofore required the writing of the word \"poison\" on poisonous doctrines. The bodies of our people are so valuable that the druggists and physicians must be careful to properly label all poisons; why not be as careful to protect the spiritual life of our people from the poisons that kill the soul? There is a test that is sometimes used to ascertain whether one suspected of mental infirmity is really insane. He is put into a tank of water and told to dip the tank dry while a stream of water flows into the tank. If he has not sense enough to turn off the stream he is adjudged insane. Can parents justify themselves if, knowing the effect of belief in evolution, they permit irreligious teachers to inject skepticism and infidelity in the minds of their children? Do bad doctrines corrupt the morals of students? We have a case in point. Mr. Darrow, one of the most distinguished criminal lawyers in our land, was engaged about a year ago in defending two rich men's sons who were on trial for as dastardly a murder as was ever committed. The older one, \"Babe\" Leopold, was a brilliant student, 19 years old. He was an evolutionist and an atheist. He was also a follower of Nietzsche, whose books he had devoured and whose philosophy he had adopted. Mr. Darrow made a plea for him, based upon the influence that Nietzsche's philosophy had exerted on the boy's mind. Here are extracts from his speech: \"Babe took to philosophy... He grew up in this way; he became enamored of the philosophy of Nietzsche. Your honor, I have read almost everything that Nietzsche ever wrote. A man of wonderful intellect; the most original philosopher of the last century. A man who made a deeper imprint on philosophy than any other man within a hundred years. In a way he has reached more people, and still he has been a philosopher of what we might call the intellectual cult. \"He wrote one book called 'Beyond Good and Evil,' which was a criticism of all moral precepts, as we understood them, and a treatise that the intelligent was beyond good and evil; that the laws for good and the laws for evil did not apply to anybody who approached the superman. He wrote on the will to power.\"I have just made a few short extracts from Nietzsche that show the things that he (Leopold) has read, and these are short and almost taken at random. It is not how this would affect you. It is not how it would affect me. The question is, how it would affect the impressionable, visionary, dreamy mind of a boy \u2014 a boy who should never have seen it \u2014 too early for him.\" Quotations from Nietzsche: \"Why so soft, oh my brethren? Oh why so soft, so unresisting and yielding? Why is there so much disavowal and abnegation, in your heart? Why is there so little faith in your looks? For all creators are hard and it must seem blessedness unto you to press your hand upon millenniums and upon wax. This new table, ah, my brethren, I put over you; become hard. To be obsessed by moral consideration presupposes a very low grade of intellect. We should substitute for morality the will to our own end and consequently to the means to accomplish that. A great man, a man whom nature has built up and invented in a grand style, is colder, harder, less cautious and more free from the fear of public opinion. He does not possess the virtues which are compatible with respectability with being respected, nor any of these things which are counted among the virtues of the herd.\" Mr. Darrow says: That the superman, a creation of Nietzsche, has permeated every college and university in the civilized world. \"There is not any university in the world where the professor is not familiar with Nietzsche, not one... Some believe it and some do not believe it. Some read it as I do and take it as a theory, a dream, a vision, mixed with good and bad. but not in any way related to human life. Some take it seriously... There is not a university in the world of any high standing where the professors do not tell you about Nietzsche and discuss him or where the books are not there. \"If this boy is to blame for this, where did he get it? Is there any blame attached because somebody took Nietzsche's philosophy seriously and fashioned his life upon it? And there is no question in this case but what that is true. Then who is to blame? The university would he more to blame than he is; the scholars of the world would be more to blame than he is. The purposes of the world ... are more to blame than he is. Your honor, it is hardly fair to hang a 19 year-old boy for the philosophy that was taught him at the university. It does not meet my ideas of justice and fairness to visit upon his head the philosophy that has been taught by university men for 25 years.\" In fairness to Mr. Darrow, I think I ought to quote two more paragraphs. After this bold attempt to excuse the student on the ground that he was transformed from a well-meaning youth into a murderer by the philosophy of an atheist, and on the further ground that his philosophy was in the libraries of all the colleges and discussed by the professors \u2014 some adopting the philosophy and some rejecting it \u2014 on these two grounds, he denied that the boy should be held responsible for the taking of human life. He charges that the scholars in the universities were more responsible than the boy, and that the universities were more responsible than the boy, because they furnished such books to the students, and then he proceeds to exonerate the universities and scholars, leaving nobody responsible. Here is Mr. Darrow's language: \"Now I do not want to be misunderstood about this. Even for the sake of saving, the lives of my clients, I do not want to be dishonest and tell the court something that I do not honestly think in this case. I do not think that the universities are to blame. I do not think they should be held responsible. I do think however, that they are too large and that they should keep a closer watch, if possible, upon, the individual. \"But you can not destroy thought, because forsooth, some brain may be deranged by thought. It is the duty of the university as I conceive it, to be the greatest storehouse of the wisdom of the ages, and to have its students come there and learn, choose. I have no doubt but that it has meant the death of many, but that we can not help.\" This is a damnable philosophy, and yet it is the flower that blossoms on the stalk of evolution. Mr. Darrow thinks the universities are in duty bound to feed out this poisonous stuff to their students, and when the students become stupefied by it and commit murder, neither they nor the universities are to blame. I protest against the adoption of any such a philosophy in the state of Tennessee. A criminal is not relieved from responsibility merely because he found Nietzsche's philosophy in a library which ought not to contain it. Neither is the university guiltless if it permits such corrupting nourishment to be fed to the souls that are entrusted to its care. But, go a step farther, would the state be blameless if it permitted the universities under its control to be turned into training schools for murder? When you get back to the root of this question, you will find that the legislature not only had a right to protect the students from the evolutionary hypothesis, but was in duty bound to do so. While on this subject, let me call your attention to another proposition embodied in Mr. Darrow's speech. He said that Dicky Loeb, the younger boy, had read trashy novels, of the blood and thunder sort. He even went so far as to commend an Illinois statute which forbids minors reading stories of crime. Here is what Mr. Darrow said: \"We have a statute in this state, passed only last year, if I recall it, which forbids minors reading stories of crime. Why? There is only one reason; because the legislature in its wisdom, thought it would have a tendency to produce these thoughts and this life in the boys who read them.'' If Illinois can protect her boys, why can not this state protect the boys of Tennessee? Are the boys of Illinois any more precious than yours? But to return to the philosophy of an evolutionist, Mr. Darrow said: \"I say to you seriously that the parents of Dickey Loeb are more responsible than he, and yet few boys had better parents.\" Again he says: \"I know that one of two things happened to this boy: That this terrible crime was inherent in his organism and came from ancestor or that it came through his education and his training after he was born.\" He thinks the boy was not responsible for anything; his guilt was due, according to this philosophy, either to heredity or environment. But let me complete Mr. Darrow's philosophy based on evolution. He says: \"I do not know what remote ancestor may have sent down the seed that corrupted him, and I do not know through how many ancestors it may have passed until it reached Dicky Loeb. All I know, it is true, and there is not a biologist in the world who will not say I am right.\" Psychologists who build upon the evolutionary hypothesis teach that man is nothing but a bundle of characteristics inherited from brute ancestors. This is the philosophy which Darrow applied to his celebrated criminal case. \"Some remote ancestor \u2014 he does not know how remote \u2014 \"sent down the seed that corrupted him.\" You can not punish the ancestor \u2014 he is not only dead, but, according to the evolutionists, he was a brute and may have lived 1,000,000 years ago. And he says that all the biologists agree with him \u2014 no wonder so small a percent of the biologists, according to Leuba, believe in a personal God. This is the quintessence of evolution, distilled for us by one who follows that doctrine to its logical conclusion. Analyze this dogma of darkness and death. Evolutionists say that back in the twilight of life a beast, name and nature unknown, planted a murderous seed and that the impulse that originated in that seed throbs forever in the blood of the brute's descendants, inspiring killings innumerable, for which murderers are not responsible because coerced by a fate fixed by the laws of heredity. It is an insult to reason and shocks the heart. That doctrine is as deadly as leprosy; it may aid a lawyer in a criminal case, but it would, if generally adopted, destroy all sense of responsibility and menace the morals of the world. A brute, they say, can predestine a man to crime, and yet they deny that God-incarnated flesh can release a human being from his bondage or save him from ancestral sins. No more repulsive doctrine was ever proclaimed by man; if all the biologists of the world teach this doctrine \u2014 as Darrow says they do \u2014 then may Heaven defend the youth of our land from their impious babblings. We Must Not Forget God Our third indictment against evolution is that it diverts attention from pressing problems of great importance to trifling speculation. While one evolutionist is trying to imagine what happened in the dim past, another is trying to pry open the door of the distant future. One recently grew eloquent over ancient worms, and another predicted that 75,000 years hence everyone will he bald and toothless. But those who endeavor to clothe our remote ancestors with hair and those who endeavor to remove the hair from the heads of our remote descendants ignore the present with its imperative demands. The science of \"how to live\" is the most important of all the sciences. It is desirable to know the physical sciences, but it is necessary to know how to live. Christians desire that their children shall be taught all the sciences, but they do not want them to lose sight of the rock of ages while they study the age of the rocks; neither do they desire them to become so absorbed in measuring the distance between the stars that they will forget Him who holds the stars in his hand. While not more than two per cent of our population are college graduates, these, because of enlarged powers, need a \"heavenly vision,\" even more than those less learned, both for their own restraint and to assure society that their enlarged powers will be used for the benefit of society and not against the public welfare. Evolution is deadening to spiritual life of a multitude of students. Christians do not desire less education, but they desire that religion shall be entwined with learning so that our boys and girls will return from college with their hearts aflame with love of God and love of fellow men, and prepared to lead in the altruistic work that the world so sorely needs. The cry in the business world, in the industrial, even in the religious world \u2014 is for consecrated talents \u2014 for ability plus a passion for service. Our fourth indictment against the evolutionary hypothesis is that, by paralyzing the hope of reform, it discourages those who labor for the improvement of man's condition. Every upward-looking man or woman seeks to lift the level upon which mankind stands, and they trust that they will see beneficent changes during the brief span of their own lives. Evolution chills their enthusiasm by substituting aeons for years. It obscures all beginnings in the midst of endless ages. It is represented as a cold and heartless process, beginning with time and ending in eternity, and acting so slowly that even the rocks can not preserve a record of the imaginary changes through which it is credited with having carried an original germ of life that appeared sometime from somewhere. Its only program for man is scientific breeding, a system under which a few supposedly superior intellects, self-appointed, would direct the mating and the movements of the mass of mankind \u2014 an impossible system. Evolution, disputing the miracle and ignoring the spiritual in life, has no place for the regeneration of the individual. It recognizes no cry of repentance and scoffs at the doctrine that one can be born? It is thus the tolerant and unrelenting enemy of the only process that can redeem society through the redemption of the individual. An evolutionist would never write such a story as the Prodigal Son; it contradicts the whole theory of evolution. The two sons inherited in the same parents, and through their parents from the same ancestors, proximate and remote. And these sons were reared at the same fireside and were surrounded by the same environment during all the days of their youth; and yet they were different. If Mr. Darrow is correct in the theory applied to Loeb, namely, that his crime was due either to inheritance or to environment, how will he explain the difference between the elder brother and the wayward son? The evolutionist may understand from observation, if not by experience, even though he can not explain why one of these boys was guilty of every immorality, squandered the money that the father had laboriously earned, and brought dis- grace upon the family name; but his theory does not explain why a wicked man underwent a change of heart, confessed his sins and begged forgiveness, and because the evolutionist can not understand this fact one of the most important in the human life, he can not understand the infinite love of the Heavenly Father who stands ready to welcome home any repentant sinner, no matter how far he has wandered, how often he has failed, or how deep he has sunk in sin. Your honor has quoted from a wonderful poem written by a great Tennessee poet, Walter Malone. I venture to quote another stanza which puts into exquisite language the new opportunity which a merciful God gives everyone who will turn from sin to righteousness: \"Tho' deep in mire wring not your hands and weep, \"I lend my arm to all who say 'I can.' \"No shamefaced outcast ever sank so deep, \"But he might rise and be a man.\" There are no lines like these in all that evolutionists have ever written. Darwin says that science has nothing to do with the Christ who taught the spirit embodied in the words of Walter Malone, and yet this spirit is the only hope of human progress. A heart can be changed in the the twinkling of an eye, and, a change in the life follows a change in the heart. If one heart can be changed, then a world can be born in a day. It is the fact that inspires all who labor for man's betterment. It is because Christians believe in individual regeneration and in the regeneration of society through the regeneration of individuals that they pray: \"Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven.\" Evolution makes a mockery of the Lord's prayer! To interpret the words to mean that the improvement desired must come slowly through unfolding ages \u2014 a process with which each generation could have little to do \u2014 is to defer hope, and hope deferred makes the heart sick. Evolution Demoralizing & Deadly Our fifth indictment of the evolutionary hypothesis is that if taken seriously and made the basis of a philosophy of life, it would eliminate love and carry man back to a struggle of tooth and claw. The Christians who have allowed themselves to be deceived into believing that evolution is a beneficent, or even a rational, process have been associating with those who either do not understand its application or dare not avow their knowledge of these implicators. Let me give you some authority on this subject. I will begin with Darwin, the high priest of evolution, to whom all evolutionists bow. On pages 149 and 150, in \" [The Descent of Man](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0814720641?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0814720641),\" already referred, he says: \"With savages, the weak in body or mind are soon eliminated and those that survive commonly exhibit a vigorous state of health. We civilized men, on the other hand, do our utmost to check the process of elimination, we build asylums for the imbecile, the maimed and the sick; we institute poor laws; and our medical men exert their utmost skill to save the life of every one to the last moment. There is reason to believe that vaccination has preserved thousands who from a weak constitution would formerly have succumbed to smallpox. Thus the weak members of civilized society propagate their kind. No one who has attended to the breeding of domestic animals will doubt that this must be highly injurious to the race of man. It is surprising how soon a want of care, or care wrongly directed, leads to the degeneration of a domestic race, but, excepting in the case of man himself, hardly a one is so ignorant as to allow his worst animals to breed. \"The aid which we feel impelled to give to the helpless is mainly an incidental result of the instinct of sympathy, which was originally acquired as part of the social instincts, but subsequently rendered in the manner previously indicated, more tender and more widely diffused. Nor could we check our sympathy, even at the urging of hard reason, without deterioration in the noblest part of nature... We must therefore, bear the undoubtedly bad effects of the weak surviving and propagating their kind.\" Darwin reveals the barbarous sentiment that runs through evolution and dwarfs the moral nature of those who become obsessed with it. Let us analyze the quotation just given. Darwin speaks with approval of the savage custom of eliminating the weak so that only the strong will survive and complains that \"we civilized men do our utmost to check the process of elimination.\" How inhuman such a doctrine as this! He thinks it injurious to \"build asylums for the imbecile, the maimed and the sick.\" Or to care for the poor. Even the medical men come in for criticism because they \"exert their utmost skill to save the life of everyone to the last moment,\" and then note his hostility to vaccination because it has \"preserved thousands who, from a weak constitution, would, but for vaccination, have succumbed to smallpox.\" All of the sympathetic activities of civilized society are condemned because they enable \"the weak members to propagate their kind.\" Then he drags mankind down to the level of the brute and compares the freedom given to man unfavorably with the restraint that we put on barnyard beasts. The second paragraph of the above quotation shows that his kindly heart rebelled against the cruelty of his doctrine. He says that we \"feel impelled to give to the helpless,\" although he traces it to a sympathy which he thinks is developed by evolution; he even admits that we could not check this sympathy \"even at the urging of hard reason, without deterioration of the noblest part of our nature.\" \"We therefore bear,\" what he regards as \"the undoubtedly bad effect of the weak surviving and propagating their kind.\" Could any doctrine be more destructive of civilization? And what a commentary on evolution! He wants us to believe that evolution develops a human sympathy that finally becomes so tender that it repudiates the law that created it and thus invites a return to a level where the extinguishing of pity and sympathy will permit the brutal instincts to again do their progressive work. Let no one think that this acceptance of barbarism, as the basic principle of evolution, died with Darwin. Within three years a book has appeared whose author is even more frankly brutal than Darwin. The book is entitled \" [The New Decalogue of Science,](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0766195481?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0766195481)\" and has attracted wide attention. One of our most reputable magazines has recently printed an article by him defining the religion of a scientist. In his preface he acknowledges indebtedness to 21 prominent scientists and educators, \"nearly all of them doctors\" and \"professors.\" One of them who has recently been elevated to the head of a great state university read the manuscript over twice and made many valuable suggestions. The author describes Nietzsche, who, according to Mr. Darrow, made a murderer out of Babe Leopold, as the bravest soul since Jesus. He admits Nietzsche was \"gloriously wrong,\" but he affirms that Nietzsche was \"gloriously right in his fearless questioning of the universe and of his own soul.\" In another place the author says: \"Most of our morals today are jungle products.\" And then he affirms that: \"It would be safer, biologically, if they were more so.\" Now, after these two samples of his views, you will not be surprised when I read you the following: \"Evolution is a bloody business, but civilization tries to make it a pink tea. Barbarism is the only process by which man has ever organically progressed and civilization is the only process by which he has ever organically declined. \"Civilization is the most dangerous enterprise on which man ever set out. For when you take man out of the bloody, brutal, but beneficent hand of natural selection you place him at once in the soft, daintily gloved, but far more dangerous hand of artificial selection. \"And unless you call science to your assistance and make this artificial selection as efficient as the rude methods of nature, you bungle the whole task.\" This aspect of evolution may amaze some of the ministers who have not been permitted to enter the inner circle of the iconoclasts whose theories menace all the ideals of civilized society. Do these ministers know that evolution is a \"bloody business\"? Do they know that barbarism is the only process by which man has ever organically progressed, and \"that civilization is the only process by which he has ever organically declined\" ? Do they know that the bloody, brutal hand of natural selection is beneficent and the artificial selection \"found in civilization is dangerous\"? What shall we think of the distinguished educators and scientists who read the manuscript before publication and did not protest against this pagan doctrine? To show that this is a world-wide matter, I now quote from a book issued from the press in 1918, seven years ago. The title of the book is \"The Science of the Power,\" and its author, Benjamin Kidd, being an Englishman, could not have any national prejudice against Darwin. On pages 46 and 47 we find Kidd's interpretation of evolution: \"Darwin's presentation of the evolution of the world as the product of natural selection in never-ceasing war, as a product that is to say, of a struggle in which the individual efficient in the fight for his own interests was always the winning type \u2014 touched the profoundest depths of the psychology of the west. \"The idea seemed to present the whole order of progress in the world as the result of a purely mechanical and materialistic process resting on force. In so doing it was a conception which reached the springs of that heredity born of the unmeasured ages of conquest out of which the western mind has come. Within half a century the 'Origin of Species' had become the Bible of the doctrine of the omnipotence of force.\" Kidd goes so far as to charge that \"Nietzsche recited the interpretation of the popular Darwinism, delivered with the fury and intensity of genius.\" And yet Nietzsche denounced Christianity as the \"doctrine of the degenerate,\" and mercy as \"the refuge of weaklings.\" Kidd says that Nietzsche gave Germany the doctrine of Darwin's efficient animal in the voice of his sermon, and that Bernhardi and the military textbooks in due time gave Germany the doctrine of the superman translated into the national policy of the superstate aiming at world power. And what else but the spirit of evolution can account for the popularity of the selfish doctrine, \"each one for himself, and the devil take the hindmost,\" that threatens the very existence of the doctrine of brotherhood ?\" In 1900 \u2014 25 years ago, while an international peace congress was in session at Paris, the following editorial appeared in L'Univers: \"The spirit of peace has fled the earth because evolution has taken possession of it. The plea for peace in past years has been inspired by faith in the divine nature and the divine origin of man; men were then looked upon as children of one father and war therefore was fratricide. But now that men are looked upon as children of apes, what matters it whether they were slaughtered or not?\" When there is poison in the blood, no one knows on what part of the body it will break out, but we can be sure that it will break out unless the blood is purified. One of the leading universities of the south, (I love the state too well to mention its name), publishes a monthly magazine entitled, \"Journal of Social Forces.\" In the January issue of this year a contributor has a lengthy article on \"Zoology and Ethics,\" in the course of which he says: \"No attempt will be made to take up the matter of the good or evil of sexual intercourse among humans aside from the matter of conscious procreation, but as an historian it might be worth while to ask the exponents of the impurity complex to explain the fact that without exception the great herds of cultural affloescence have been those characterized by a large amount of freedom in sex relations and that those of the greatest cultural degradation and decline have been accompanied with greater sex repression and purity.\" No one charges or suspects that all or any large percentage of the advocates of evolution sympathize with this loathsome application of evolution to social life, but it is worth while to inquire why those in charge of a great institution of learning allow such filth to be poured out for the stirring of the passions of its students. Just one more quotation: \"The Southeastern Christian Advocate\" of June 25, 1925, quotes five eminent college men of Great Britain as joining in answer to the question: \"Will civilization survive?\" Their reply is that \"Greatest danger to our civilization is the abuse of the achievements of science. Mastery over the forces of nature has endowed the twentieth century man with a power which he is not fit to exercise. Unless the development of morality catches up with the development of technique, humanity is bound to destroy itself.\" Can any Christian remain indifferent? Science needs religion to direct its energies and to inspire with lofty purpose those who employ the forces that are unloosed by science. Evolution is at war with religion because religion is supernatural, it is therefore the relentless foe of Christianity which is a revealed religion. Let us, then, hear the conclusion of the whole matter. Science is a magnificent material for force, but is not a teacher of morals. It is perfect machinery, but it adds no moral restraints to protect society from the misuse of the machine. It can also build gigantic intellectual ships, but it constructs no moral rudders for control of storm tossed human vessels. It not only fails to supply the spiritual element needed, but some of its unproven hypotheses rob the ship of its compass and thus endanger its cargo. In war, science has proven itself an evil genius, it has made war more terrible than it ever was before. Man used to be content to slaughter his fellowman on a single plane \u2014 the earth's surface. Science has taught him to go down into the water and shoot up; to go up into the clouds and shoot down from above, thus making the battlefield three times as bloody as it was before; but science does not teach brotherly love. Science has made war so hellish that civilization has but to commit suicide; and now we are told that newly discovered instruments of destruction will make the cruelties of the late war seem trivial in comparison with the cruelties of war that may come in the future. If civilization is to be saved from the wreckage threatened by intelligence not consecrated by love, it must be saved by the moral code of the meek and lowly Nazarene. His teachings and His teachings alone can solve the problems that vex the heart and perplex the world. The world needs a saviour more than it ever did, and His is the only name under Heaven whereby we must be saved. It is this name that evolution degrades, for carried to its logical conclusion, it robs Christ of the glory of a virgin birth, of the majesty of His deity and mission, and of the triumph of His resurrection. It also disputes the doctrine of the atonement. It is for the jury to determine whether this attack upon the Christian religion shall be permitted in the public schools of Tennessee by teachers employed by the state and paid out of the public treasury. This case is no longer local; the defendant ceases to play an important part. The case assumes the proportions of a battle royal between unbelief that attempts to speak through so called science and the defenders of the Christian faith, speaking through the legislators of Tennessee. It is again a choice between God and Baal. It is a renewal of the issue in Pilate's court. In that historic trial \u2014 the greatest in history \u2014 force, impersonated by Pilate, occupied the throne. Behind it was the Roman government, mistress of the world, and behind the Roman government were the legions of Rome. Before Pilate stood Christ, the apostle of love. Force triumphed, they nailed Him to the tree and those who stood around mocked and jeered and said, \"Christ is dead.\" But from that day the power of Caesar waned and the power of Christ increased. In a few centuries the Roman government was gone and its legions forgotten; while the crucified and risen Lord is the greatest fact in history and the growing figure of all time. Again love and force meet face to face and again, \"What Shall I Do With Jesus\" must be answered. A bloody doctrine, evolution demands, as the rabble did 1,900 years ago, that He be crucified. This can not be the answer of the jury representing a Christian state and sworn to uphold the laws of Tennessee. Your answer will be heard throughout the world; it is eagerly awaited by a praying multitude. If the law is nullified there will be rejoicing where ever God is repudiated, the Saviour scoffed at and the Bible ridiculed. Every unbeliever of every kind and degree will be happy. If, on the other hand, the law is upheld and the religion of the school children protected, millions of Christians will call you blessed, and with hearts full of gratitude to God will again sing that old song of triumph: \"Faith of our fathers, living still, In spite of dungeon, fire and sword, Oh, how our hearts beat high with joy, Whene'er we hear that glorious word:\u2014 Faith of our fathers\u2014holy faith, We will be true to thee till death.\" Skeptical perspectives on evolution and creationism - [Reinventing Evolution: Creationism and Contingency](https://www.skeptic.com/productlink/av079) (DVD Shermer - - [The New Creationism: Intelligent Design Theory](https://www.skeptic.com/productlink/av096) (DVD $]23.95) by Jared Diamond - - [A Darwin Day 200th Birthday Celebration](https://www.skeptic.com/productlink/av197) (DVD $23.95 CD $15.95) with Donald Prothero, Michael "}
