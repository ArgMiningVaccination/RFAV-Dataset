Kay How you choose to spend the first moments of the day can create a template for how that day unfolds. Integrating dinacharya\u2014Ayurvedic self-care routines\u2014into your daily schedule sets you up for greater balance and well-being. One of my favorites morning routines is abhyanga, Ayurveda's daily ritual of oil self-massage, which promotes vitality, strength, and flexibility. When I heat scented oils and lovingly rub them into my skin before fully entering my day, it feels as though I'm wearing a soft shield that buffers me against everything from chilly breezes to my own reactivity. Abhyanga should be resorted to daily. It wards off old age, exertion, and aggravation of vata. \u2014Ashtanga Hrdayam: Sutrasthana: II: 8-9 There are scores of abhyanga therapies specific to various conditions, but for your own daily anointing, the oils you choose\u2014and even your underlying intention\u2014will depend on your dosha (Ayurvedic constitution). (If you don't know your dosha, read more about the indicators of each constitution.) See the sidebar to learn how abhyanga can be tailored to your dosha. When you practice abhyanga, you're nurturing yourself in multiple ways, including nourish- ing and protecting the largest organ of your body: your skin. Many of the oils recommended for abhyanga contain anti-inflammatory nutrients. Natural oils can help to balance the pH of the skin, heal minor wounds and abrasions, and keep the skin hydrated. On the days I practice abhyanga, all my senses feel more accessible, particularly my sense of touch. Vata Slow, gentle massage with plenty of oil, using long strokes Begin at the feet, then move up to the belly and upper body, ending at the head Purpose is rejuvenation Pitta Gentle, firm, rhythmic massage with moderate amount of oil Begin at the head, then move down to the belly and lower body, ending at the feet Purpose is balance Kapha Deep, firm, rigorous massage, with little oil; dry herb powders are usually preferred Begin at the belly, then move down the body and to the feet, and end back up at the head Purpose is cleansing Abhyanga for Y our Dosha The oils you choose\u2014and even your underlying intention\u2014 will depend on your dosha (Ayurvedic constitution). continued on page 22 Practice SUMMER 2015 V olume 24 Issue 2 go to page 1 Abhyanga go to page 3 Chill Out with Ayurveda go to page 5 V edanta go to page 8 Y oga for Disease go to page 10 Letter from David go to page 11 Wisdom of Jyotish go to page 13 KY AA ConferenceContact Information Kripalu Y oga and Ayurveda 413.448.3202 website: kripalu.org/kyaa e-mail: kyaa@kripalu.org Kripalu Registration 800.741.7353 is published by Kripalu Center for Y oga & Health, PO Box 309, Stockbridge, MA 01262. \u00a92015 All rights reserved. Kripalu Center for Y oga & Health is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit educational organization whose mission is to empower people and communities to realize their full potential through the transformative wisdom and practice of yoga. Abhyanga also harmonizes your energy body and stimulates circulation. I think of movement as a nutrient, and the action associated with massage benefits your immune and circulatory health, pumping lymph and encouraging blood flow. Some of the evidence-based benefits of yoga\u2014such as the activation of the vagus nerve, with its profound positive impact on our neurobiology and epigenetics\u2014can be accessed through a mindful practice of abhyanga. Mentally and emotionally, taking the time for self-care is a loving gift to yourself (the Sanskrit word for oil, sneha, can also translate as love). The practice of ab - hyanga reminds me that even the busiest or most challenging day can begin or end with a few moments of soothing pleasure. Even taking the time to prepare the oils is a sustained act of self-love. I can't do abhyanga without seeing my life as more joyful and pleasant\u2014bigger than just a col-lection of tasks and deadlines. It also helps me stay more ground-ed, focused, and balanced. When I find myself with the telltale combination of dry skin, frazzled or grumpy mind, and tired body, I know that rededication to abhyanga can help me get back to my resilient, centered self, quickly and easily. While the Western scientific community has thus far paid less attention to Ayurvedic practices than to yoga, stay tuned. A small trial published in the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine found that an hour of abhyanga produced reductions in self-reported stress and heart rate in all participants, and lowered blood pressure in indi-viduals with pre-hypertension. As researchers focus more on these practices, they may well confirm what yogis have known all along: The body of one who uses oil massage regularly does not become affected much, even if subjected to accidental injuries or strenuous work. By using oil massage daily, a person ... becomes strong, charming, and least affected by old age. \u2014Charaka Samhita: Sutrasthana: V: 88-89 n Annie Nutritionist at Kripalu, is an integrative dietitian, Kripalu Yoga teacher, and author of the award-winning book Every Bite Is Divine. everybiteisdivine.comThe Benefits of Abhyanga continued from page 1 When I heat scented oils and lovingly rub them into my skin before fully entering my day, it feels as though I'm wearing a soft shield that buffers me against everything from chilly breezes to my own reactivity. 3 SUMMER 2015 V olume 24 Issue 2 Practice go to page 1 Abhyanga go to page 3 Chill Out with Ayurveda go to page 5 V edanta go to page 8 Y oga for Disease go to page 10 Letter from David go to page 11 Wisdom of Jyotish go to page 13 KY AA Conference go to page 1 Abhyanga go to page 3 Chill Out with Ayurveda go to page 5 V edanta go to page 8 Y oga for Disease go to page 10 Letter from David go to page 11 Wisdom of Jyotish go to page 13 KY AA ConferenceChill Out with Ayurveda RECIPES AND PRACTICES FOR STA YING COOL IN THE PITTA SEASON According to Ayurveda, it's the season of pitta\u2014 hot, sharp, and bright\u2014and that can make us feel like wilted flowers, drained of energy, or we can find ourselves getting more easily irritated and hot-tempered. In Ayurveda, we balance with opposites, so look to activities and foods that are heavy, cool, and moist. On these pages, the Kripalu School of Ayurveda faculty offers recipes, a pranayama practice, and daily routines to keep you cool, alert, and emotionally balanced.Pranayama to Balance Pitta Chandra Bhedana, the Moon-Piercing Breath This pranayama evokes lunar, feminine, cooling qualities. T o practice, gently place the right thumb over the right nostril. T ake a deep inhalation through the left nostril. At the top of the inhale, seal off the left nostril with the right ring finger and exhale through the right nostril. Continue in this rhythm: Inhale through the left nostril, exhale through the right, inhale left, exhale right. Practice for eight minutes each day.

Though it's tempting to drink iced beverages when it's hot out, Ayurveda teaches that ice reduces the strength of our digestive fire. Instead, choose drinks that have a naturally cooling nature even without ice, like watermelon juice or coconut water. Or try this refreshing Ayurvedic take on a sports drink, which is especially good on days when you've worked or played a little too long in the sun. This recipe uses limes, which are cooling, rather than lemons, which are heating, according to Ayurveda. Juice of half a lime or whole lime, depending on size Pinch of mineral or sea salt 1 \u00bd cups water, at room temperature Sweetener to taste (maple syrup or raw sugar are more cooling options) If you're feeling especially hot, try adding \u00bc cup of pomegranate juice to enhance the cooling quality. SIMPLE SUMMER SOUP In spring, you'll want to enjoy this easy-to-digest soup while it's warm; in summer, you might want to let it cool to room temperature for a refreshing light lunch or dinner. This recipe includes broccoli, celery, and spinach, but feel free to experiment with a variety of green vegetables, including asparagus, collard greens, and Swiss chard, as well as fresh herbs like mint, parsley, or cilantro when blending. V egetables deliver antioxidants that cleanse the blood, keeping pitta in check. T o stimulate low appetite and a heavy feeling in the stomach, add a little fresh ginger when cooking. 2 cups water 4 cups fresh broccoli crowns and stalks, chopped in 1-inch pieces 3 stalks fresh celery, chopped in 1-inch pieces 1 teaspoon black pepper 1 teaspoon ground turmeric 4 cups fresh spinachSalt to taste Fresh lemon juice Combine the water, broccoli, celery, black pepper, and turmeric (plus minced ginger to taste, if using) in a medium-sized saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium and cook 10 minutes, or until vegetables begin to soften. Place entire contents of saucepan in a blender with the spinach, and add herbs if using. (Y ou can also use an immersion blender.) Blend until smooth; you might need to add more hot water to achieve a desired consistency. Add salt to taste and a squeeze of lemon.Ayurveda for Keeping Y our Cool As the temperature begins to spike, you might notice that your emotions start to mirror the sticky situation outside. If you find yourself getting agitated, critical, and impatient during the dog days of summer, try these practices to keep from melting down! Get outside and connect with nature. T ake a calming walk in the shady woods or a nearby park. Spend some time under the night sky, gazing at the stars. Leave some space in your schedule so you have room to air out emotionally; give yourself permission now and again to take a lazy day to decompress. T ake a cool foot bath. Steer clear of violent movies and television shows, which aggravate pitta. Keep good company. Avoid critical, argumentative people, and spend time with those who make you feel buoyant and light. Avoid the sun during the hotter times of the day, and wear loosely woven fabrics, preferably in light colors. Eat with the season\u2014nature provides the antidote to whatever ails you. If it's growing in your garden, chances are it will pacify pitta. Watermelon, cantaloupe, or a light salad with fresh herbs are all cooling choices. Avoid overly spicy and salty food. n 5 SUMMER 2015 V olume 24 Issue 2 Practice go to page 1 Abhyanga go to page 3 Chill Out with Ayurveda go to page 5 V edanta go to page 8 Y oga for Disease go to page 10 Letter from David go to page 11 Wisdom of Jyotish go to page 13 KY AA Conference go to page 1 Abhyanga go to page 3 Chill Out with Ayurveda go to page 5 V edanta go to page 8 Y oga for Disease go to page 10 Letter from David go to page 11 Wisdom of Jyotish go to page 13 KY AA ConferenceYoga has always been a search for truth. India's sages were pragmatic and defined truth as \"that which liber-ates from ignorance and suffering.\" They reasoned, \"If the truth can be found, then we can act in alignment with truth to live more happily and avoid unnecessary pain.\" Two different levels of truth were recognized: social truth and ultimate truth. Social truth includes all the attitudes, under-standings, and moral principles that support healthy inter-personal relationships and create a safe, just, predictable, and humane society. Sometimes this level of social truth is called by another name, dharma. A related term you may hear is svadharma, which refers to an individual's unique expression of relative truth in a chosen lifestyle, value system, and way of contributing to society. Ultimate truth is something different and deeper. India's sages believed there was an inner unity and truth underlying the apparent diversity of the external world. All the visible forces of nature were seen to have their source in this invisible unity, and the sages speculated that a person gaining access to this inner truth would discover an inexhaustible reservoir of power and intelligence lying at the heart of creation. Yoga philoso - phy records the attempts of these sages to conceptualize the ultimate truth in various ways and develop practices to experi-ence it directly. Kripalu Yoga has always remained in align-ment to the spirit of this quest for truth. All its practices are designed to help practitioners establish a direct connection to their energetic source and use it to live a more empowered, authentic, open-hearted, creative, and conscious life. A student can attain the light of [ultimate] truth only by assimilating its essence, which is locked in seed form within Vedanta's esoteric terms. The final truth of Vedanta can only be gained through the practice of yoga because it involves the realization of the soul. This requires more than mere thinking.\" \u2014Swami Kripalu The V edas and the Upanishads The first written texts that refer to yogic themes and practices are the four Vedas, which have the distinction of being the oldest books in humankind's library. Consisting of prayers, mantras, rituals, and other religious lore, the Vedas were com-posed around 3000 B.C.E. Both yoga and its sister science, Ayurveda, find their source in the Vedas, and are, at times, referred to as Vedic wisdom. Unfortunately, the ancient Vedas themselves are so cryptic that their meaning has been almost entirely lost. The first teachings that remain relevant to today's yoga practitioners are collectively referred to as Vedanta. The word Vedanta means \"the end of the Vedas.\" Along with linking these later teachings back to the Vedas, this term alludes to the notion that Vedanta distills the voluminous Vedas down to their essence. V edanta: The Ultimate T ruth In this series drawn from the writings of Y oganand Michael Carroll and Shobhan Richard Faulds, we elucidate various aspects of yoga philosophy, beginning with V edanta. Swami Kripalu considered V edanta the highest expression of the V edic scriptures because it focuses on the ultimate truth. continued on page 76 Practice SUMMER 2015 V olume 24 Issue 2 go to page 1 Abhyanga go to page 3 Chill Out with Ayurveda go to page 5 V edanta go to page 8 Y oga for Disease go to page 10 Letter from David go to page 11 Wisdom of Jyotish go to page 13 KY AA ConferenceV edanta T erms and Doctrines BRAHMAN (the Absolute) is the word used by the Upanishadic sages to describe the inner unity and ultimate truth, which they saw as eternal and imperishable. Brahman is unmanifest and invisible, the primal source and unchanging substratum of the manifest and visible universe, which is constantly changing and evolving. V edanta was one of the first philosophical systems to see matter as arising from an undifferentiated spiritual essence. Although it exists everywhere, Brahman is impossible for the human mind to grasp because it is entirely devoid of all qualities and attributes. T o realize Brahman, yogic techniques must be employed to go beyond the limited reach of the mind and senses. ATMAN (the Self) is the true individual\u2014not the personality or ego, but rather one's innermost being that lies beneath the ever-changing world of the mind, body, and senses. V edanta considers Atman the true Self, which is seen as identical and one with Brahman. The nature of Brahman and Atman is described by the compound word sat-chit-ananda. means The path to realize Brahman is to discover it as the spiritual source and true nature of your own being\u2014the Atman. M AYA (illusory power) is the external, transient world perceived by the mind and senses. The sages renounced maya as illusion because they were searching for an ultimate reality that was always and forever true. Contemplating deeply, the sages saw that maya has no separate existence apart from Brahman, whose projection of the material universe is like sunlight that can't be separated from its source, the sun. When seen as a part of Brahman, maya is simply a facet of the ultimate truth. Its deluding power arises in the individual mind, which perceives external objects through the lens of the senses and considers them lasting and real. A core assertion of V edanta is that external objects are not real but rather flickering projections cast on the screen of the mind. The veiling power of maya is sometimes referred to by another term, avidya (ignorance), the primal nescience that keeps us unaware of Atman/Brahman and looking outside of ourselves through the senses for fulfillment. Where Brahman is a formless singularity, maya takes on a dazzling multiplicity of names and forms, causing us to lose touch with our true nature as Atman and satchitananda. V edanta sees the root cause of human suffering as our willingness to accept maya as real, which leads us to wrongly identify with the body, mind, and ego. Seeing ourselves as small and separate, we seek fulfillment through gratifying our senses versus discovering our true identity as Atman.

The word \"upanishad\" means \"to sit at the feet of a master,\" and these texts preserve the spiri-tual dialogues between sages and their disci-ples. Where the authors of the Vedas sought illumination through religious rites like the fire sacrifice, it was the Upanishadic sages who first directed their attention inward, to realize truth within their own being through the systematic practice of contem-plation, meditation, and other yogic techniques. Over several centuries, these sages developed the view of Vedanta as summarized in the following terms and doctrines (see page 6). Nondualism as the Foundation of V edanta Taken together, these terms expound the principle of nondu- alism (advaita\u2014meaning \"not two\") that is foundational to the view of Vedanta. The sages believed that Brahman could never be known through the dualistic mind but, as the essence of our being, it could be realized through direct identifica - tion with Atman. They distilled this central message into two teaching maxims. The first was a clear statement that you are none other than Atman/Brahman, Tat tvam asi, which literally means \"That thou art.\" The second was a potent affirmation to be used in meditation: aham brahmasi, which means \"I am the Brahman.\" The primary tools of Vedantic meditation are vairagya, the re - nunciation of desire, and viveka, the power to discriminate be - tween what we truly are (Atman) and what we merely appear to be (maya). Meditation proceeds along a path of negation called neti neti (\"not this, not this\") and the process of systematically rejecting all false identifications. What occurs upon the realiza - tion of Brahman is conveyed through the teaching metaphor of a rope being mistaken for a venomous snake. In the moment when maya's veil of illusion is drawn aside and reality is seen directly, its nondual nature is apparent. Any sense of separation and fear of the outer world fall away when the soul realizes its true identity as the eternal Atman/Brahman. Vedanta gained prominence throughout India during the time of the Upanishads, but its influence waned with the growing popularity of Buddhism. An important figure in the revival of Vedantic thought and practice was Shankara, an eighth-cen-tury monk who travelled the continent, winning its inhabitants back to nondualism through his discourses and public debates. Historians credit Shankara with consolidating the ideas found in the Upanishads into a coherent philosophy, which he called Vedanta. His best-known work is Viveka Chudamani (The Crest Jewel of Discrimination). Vedanta remains a vital wisdom tradition, with most of its Western practice schools drawing inspiration from Ramana Maharshi, a sage who lived from 1879 to 1950 and popularized the practice of self-inquiry. Although different names are used for the ultimate truth, the quest for Brahman remains a constant of yoga philosophy. n T aken together, these terms expound the principle of nondualism (advaita\u2014meaning \"not two\") that is foundational to the view of Vedanta. Meditation proceeds along a path of negation called neti neti (\"not this, not this\") and the process of systematically rejecting all false identifications.8 Practice SUMMER 2015 V olume 24 Issue 2 go to page 1 Abhyanga go to page 3 Chill Out with Ayurveda go to page 5 V edanta go to page 8 Y oga for Disease go to page 10 Letter from David go to page 11 Wisdom of Jyotish go to page 13 KY AA Conference The Impact of Y oga on Lifestyle Disease RESEARCH AND RAMIFICATIONS by Sat Bir S. Khalsa The intent of yoga is to create well-being as a result of physical, emotional, mental, social, and spiritual balance. This is also the intent of medicine, as defined by the World Health Organization. While the entire focus of yoga is to create such a balance to prevent diseases, yoga can be used to cure or manage diseases as well. A general feature of yoga practice\u2014including asana, pranayama, and medita - tion\u2014is its capability of inducing a coordinated psychophysiological response, which is the antithesis of the stress response. This \"relaxation response\" consists of a generalized reduction in both cognitive and somatic arousal, as observed in the modified activity of the hypothalamic pituitary axis and the autonomic nervous system. Basu Bagchi and M. A. Wenger, in their early yoga research, wrote, \"Physiologically, yogic meditation represents deep relaxation of the auto - nomic nervous system without drowsiness or sleep.\" A large number of subsequent research studies examining the effects of these techniques, both in isolation and in combination, have further confirmed these early results. Yoga practice is most typically associated with reductions in the levels of the stress hormones cortisol and the catecholamines; a decrease in sympathetic activity, with a corresponding increase in parasympathetic activity; reductions in metabolic rate and oxygen consumption; and salutary effects on cognitive activity and cerebral neurophysiology. The first systematic medical application of yoga started in India in 1918, at the Yoga Institute at Versova near Mumbai. This was soon followed by clinical work at the Kaivalyadhama Yoga Institute in Lonavala under Swami Kuvalyananda in CONFERENCE PRESENTER continued on page 9A general feature of yoga practice\u2014including asana, pranayama, and meditation\u2014is its capability of inducing a coordinated psychophysiological response, which is the antithesis of the stress response.9 SUMMER 2015 V olume 24 Issue 2 Practice go to page 1 Abhyanga go to page 3 Chill Out with Ayurveda go to page 5 V edanta go to page 8 Y oga for Disease go to page 10 Letter from David go to page 11 Wisdom of Jyotish go to page 13 KY AA Conference go to page 1 Abhyanga go to page 3 Chill Out with Ayurveda go to page 5 V edanta go to page 8 Y oga for Disease go to page 10 Letter from David go to page 11 Wisdom of Jyotish go to page 13 KY AA Conferencethe 1920s. Subsequently, yoga therapy has proliferated in India with the establishment of yogic hospitals and clinics and the widespread application of yoga treatments by clinicians and yoga institutes. This trend has also spread internationally, with the appearance of yoga therapy centers, the inclusion of yoga programs in hospital cancer programs and affiliated alternative medicine centers, and the establishment of yoga therapy train- ing programs and the International Association of Yoga Therapists. This movement in yoga therapy comes at a time when noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) are the leading cause of death in the world. According to the World Health Organization, 38 million people die each year from NCDs, mainly from cardiovascular diseases, cancers, chronic respiratory diseases, and diabetes. More than 14 million of those deaths occur between the ages of 30 and 70, of which 85 percent are in developing countries. In most middle- and high-income countries, NCDs were responsible for more deaths than all other causes of death combined; in the United States, NCDs are estimated to account for more than 88 percent of total deaths. That number is projected to increase by 15 percent globally between 2010 and 2020. Yoga research offers a different set of statistics\u2014one that has the potential to counteract this catastrophic trend. In a national survey of yoga practitioners' mental and physical health, compared to national norms, practitioners reported better sleep, higher energy level, healthier weight, better relationships\u2014and 86.5 percent reported they were happier because of practicing yoga. A study I co-facilitated showed that increased yoga experience predicted lower body mass index and reduced medication use in women aged 45 and over. This is just a tiny fraction of a growing body of research on yoga's effects on gene expression, mood state, brain structure and function, and brain biochemistry, among many other areas of study. This work is making an impact on how the health-care field views yoga (for example, Medicare now reimburses for Dean Ornish's cardiac yoga program). As yoga practitioners have always known, intuitively and experientially, yoga doesn't just make you feel good. These practices have real, concrete results for the mind and body\u2014they positively impact everything from the brain and biochemistry to BMI and blood glucose levels. This is not a placebo effect; you don't have to \"believe in yoga\" for it to work. When you practice regularly over a significant period of time, these changes will occur. n Sat Bir S.

I'm grateful for your interest. Over the course of our history as an organization, residential volunteers have played an important part in supporting the hard work of the paid staff and faculty. Recently, the decision was made to end the residential volunteer program in late 2015, so we can shift our focus to other vital programs and activities that deliver more reliable mission impact in the field of yoga education. The decision to complete the residential volunteer program was made with great care by Kripalu leadership with the full support of the Board of Trustees, following extensive discussions about the future of the program. Questions about the alignment and sustainability of the program actually began many years ago, and continued until recently, when it became obvious that the program was not always delivering an effective curriculum based in the practice of yoga (as opposed to various self-help modalities that were not directly connected to our yoga mission). Despite efforts by numerous administrations, only a portion of the students each semester chose to go deep into disciplined yoga or Karma Yoga practice, on and off the mat. Thus, the program fell short of the standards of quality and impact that Kripalu aims to achieve in its yoga curriculum. This result is in direct contrast to the highly effective mission-driven programs at Kripalu, such as those offered by the Kripalu Schools of Yoga and Ayurveda. The Schools continue to evolve, grow, and thrive at Kripalu, while delivering exceptional yoga experiences that are both transformational and empowering. As a not-for-profit educational institution, it is necessary that we devote our time and energy only to those programs that truly deliver on the promise of the mission. The staff and leadership of Kripalu recognize the women and men who have devoted their time in selfless service. We honor, respect, and thank all of those who served in the past and those who serve today. The great majority of residential volunteers were strong contributors who helped Kripalu grow and evolve. We are humbled by what they did to support Kripalu and grateful that they took what they learned here and spread that compassionate self-awareness in the world. And we continue to support the other two volunteer programs that exist at Kripalu; together, those positive programs provide more than 1,000 opportunities a year to experience Kripalu as a volunteer. Finally, a note on adapting to change. Swami Kripalu taught that there are not 10, but 23 yogic virtues. One of the lesser known niyamas is ksama, or forbearance from judgment, about which he said: Life requires us to adapt ourselves. Both attraction and aversion disturb the mind. Neutrally bearing both, the mind of the yogi remains tranquil. In times of change, I recommend that all Kripalu Yoga practitioners and teachers join me in the practice of ksama. As yogis, we do not need to chase every thought, feeling, and emotion that occurs in life; instead, each change that life presents is an opportunity to practice observation without judgment.

We asked him to explain the origins of Jyotish, also known as V edic astrology, and its applications for contemporary practitioners. What is Jyotish, and what are its origins and philosophy? \"Jyoti\" means light and \"isha\" means God. According to the Vedas, Jyotish is the light of God that is to be used to guide souls through periods of darkness and challenge in this world. Jyotish has its origins in the teachings of the great Maharishi Parasara, regarded to be the grandfather of Vedic astrology. Originally it was an oral tradition, dating back thousands of years, until the teachings of this rishi were recorded in the two volumes called Brihat Parasara Hora Shastra. Those two volumes contain all that is to be known about the subject\u2014the calculations, philosophy, and guidelines for the interpretation of the natal chart, etc. Parasara had an erudite student called Maharishi Jaimini, who expanded on some of Parasara's teachings. His work is to be found in the Upadesa Sutras of Maharishi Jaimini. Well-trained Vedic astrologers are dedicated to the study of these classical works. What is the relationship between Jyotish and Ayurveda? Jyotish and Ayurveda are related at a very fundamental level. We have the atma (soul), the manas (mind), and ahamkara (ego), as well as the three gunas (qualities) and the tattvas (five elements), karmendriyas (five organs of action), and the tanmtras (the medium of sensations). These are the building blocks of both subjects. In Jyotish, the signs of the zodiac (rasis) and the planets (grahas) are a manifestation of the tattvas and the gunas and, according to the ancient teaching, there is a correspondence between the planets and the doshas, dhatus, and srotas. For example, you might expect the sun, Mars, and Ketu (described in Ayurvedic texts as a lunar node or half-planet) to be powerfully pitta-aggravating planets; the full moon, Jupiter, and Venus give rise to kapha dosha; and Saturn, said to be the cause of all chronic diseases, gives rise to vata dosha. So if one or more of these planets influence that part of the chart that determines one's body type, then the person will have a predominance of that dosha in his/her constitu-tion. Jyotish is said to be the most objective and reliable method of de - termining one's constitution, and it is completely unique in its capacity to time the onset of a serious illness or imbalance, whether it be on the mental/emotional or physical plane.

Jyotish offers guidance for the entire variety of experiences in human life, but I would say that people most commonly seek guidance from a Vedic astrologer around the topic of relation-ships and marriage. That includes the timing of marriage, compatibility and harmony between the couple, the birth of children, the sustenance of the marriage, marital affairs, and advice on separation and divorce. The second most com-mon area has to do with career\u2014talents, guid-ance, and promotions, as well as relationships with superiors. In general, chart interpretation focuses on determining an individual's capacity to master the four primary areas of life according to the Vedic tradition: dharma (creating purpose and meaning); artha (gaining mastery over issues related to career and money); kama (our relationships with others and society in general); and moksha (spiritual development). What tools does Jyotish offer the Ayurvedic practitioner? Vedic astrology is able to tell us what is destined to be experienced in this world well into the future. It can also tell us how we are likely to interpret those experiences and how the experiences impact our health and wellness\u2014the doshas, dhatus (tissues), and srotas (the channels through which nutrients and energy flow). Many of us are unable to fully digest our experiences, and that's where the trouble begins. If we maintain a healthy agni (digestive fire), we can work successfully with many of our challenges. This can be done on both the mental/emotional and physical levels, through meditation and good dietary practices. According to Jyotish, our karmas have to be experienced, and the planets are relentless forces of the soul that are destined to manifest. n Brendan Feeley practices Ayurveda and jyotish in the Washington DC area.
