Or a dullness or roughness that no amount of sleep or dilligent application of skincare can fix? Skin ageing\u2014premature or otherwise\u2014may be the issue at play here. While we can't stop the ageing process, we can prevent the signs from showing on our skin\u2014with a little help from Crystal Tomato's Whitening Supplement. It's no secret that environmental factors such as pollution and UV rays are one of the biggest threats to healthy, radiant skin, not least because they can induce and accelerate extrinsic ageing. This supplement helps counter this with Crystal Tomato Carotenoids, which are extracted from specially cultivated, non-genetically modified crystal tomatoes. These potent antioxidants aid in reducing the damage caused by free radicals, pollutants and the like, and better yet, offer protection against oxidative stress, thereby helping to prolong the longevity of cells and fighting premature skin ageing. Defend against free radical damage Unlike regular carotenoids, which are usually coloured and can give skin an orange tint when taken in large amounts, Crystal Tomato Carotenoids are colourless and have just as strong an antioxidant effect. Combined with the regular use of a sunscreen, this supplement offers well-rounded protection against sun damage. Working in tandem is L-Cysteine, an amino acid that promotes collagen and elastin production to plump and firm skin for a more youthful look and feel. It also stimulates the production of glutathione, which lightens pigmentation by converting melanin into a lighter hue. It's never too early to embark on an anti-ageing regime, and at just one caplet daily, this is an easy first step towards beautiful, radiant skin, no matter your age.
