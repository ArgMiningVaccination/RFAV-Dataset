DePaul's mission challenges and calls us to work toward an inclusive and conversational relationship with the diverse people, faiths, religious and spiritual traditions found within the community. University Ministry holds to the legacy of St. Vincent DePaul and St. Louise de Marillac and honors this legacy by assuring that student religious, faith or spiritual communities, groups, programs, ministries, organizations or individuals already operating on campus or hoping to organize on campus\u2014their activities, worship, service and outreach\u2014are congruent with the Vincentian tradition of being; \u009fRooted in faith and prayer. \u009fOpening and welcoming communities which connect faith to everyday life and people of all walks of life. \u009fDedicated to the service of others, especially to people who are poor or marginalized. \u009fBased on personalism that calls for a belief and practice in the sacred dignity of all people. With this in mind, University Ministry seeks to: \u009fSupport a vibrant faith and spiritual life for students of all religious faiths or spiritualities. \u009fSustain a mutually supportive and cooperative inter-faith and ecumenical culture at DePaul University. \u009fSupport and sustain the Vincentian model for service and reflection. OVERSIGHT BY UMIN University Ministry staff maintains oversight for campus religious, faith, spiritual and Vincentian service activity through three offices: \u009fCatholic Campus Ministry (CCM) \u009fThe Office of Religious Diversity (ORD) \u009fThe Vincentian Community Service Office (VCSO). Oversight and support for campus religious, faith, spiritual and DCSA Vincentian service activity are provided by UMIN staff in order to ensure that the best interests and needs of students are served and the best interest of the University are protected and promoted. To this end the UMIN Protocol and Standards direct and unify all existing and developing campus spiritual, faith, religious and Vincentian service activities. Students engaged in any of these activities must relate to UMIN in one of four ways: 1. Through a registered Student Religious Organization (SRO) within ORD and CCM. Students work with ORD or CCM staff for initial approval as an SRO and then complete the OSI registration process (See Org Sync). Student Religious Organizations are defined as a campus religious, faith or spiritual organization with a primary goal, clearly stated within the group's constitution, as on-going promotion of spiritual, religious and/or faith development among students on campus. These Organizations are sustainable, developed by students through CCM or ORD, they are officially registered and recognized through OSI and rely upon on-going support, guidance and oversight by CCM and DCM staff. 2. Through a registered DCSA-Service Organization (DCSA-SO) within VSCO. Students work with VCSO staff for initial approval as a DCSA-SO and then complete the OSI registration process (See Org Sync). Drawing upon the unique Vincentian lens that promotes work with the marginalized and insists upon personal reflection, DCSA Service Organizations specifically sponsor on-going and recurring community service opportunities within the Chicago area. These Organizations are developed by students through VCSO, they are officially registered and recognized through OSI and rely upon on-going support, guidance and oversight by VCSO staff. 3. Through an established Affiliate Group within UMIN. Leaders in these Groups work directly with UMIN staff PRIOR to engaging in any campus religious, faith, spiritual or Vincentian service activities, gatherings, events or meetings to determine the appropriateness of establishing a new Affiliate Group on campus. This option is for: \u009fStudents who wish to establish a new entity on campus. Once approved by UMIN staff as an Affiliate Group, leaders may consult with UMIN staff for consideration in seeking formal recognition on campus as a Student Religious Organization (SRO) , DCSA Service Organization (DCSA-SO) or a UMIN Ministry Program. OR \u009fStudents involved in service groups already established on campus outside of VCSO but seeking formal recognition as a registered DCSA Service Organization. Affiliate Groups are defined as student led small groups (8 or fewer students) that are loosely formed (no constitution, by-laws or foundational documents) and are developed: \u009fSolely out of interests and needs of students. \u009fOnly in consultation with UMIN staff PRIOR to the Group's formation. \u009fWith on-going guidance and oversight by UMIN staff as long as the Group functions. \u009fWith the understanding that the Group may only function for a limited time (one academic year or less) but with further understanding that the Group may, through UMIN staff guidance and oversight, move into a sustained SRO, DCSA-SO or UMIN Ministry Program. 4. Through a recognized UMIN Ministry Program within one of the three UMIN offices. Students actively engaged in UMIN ministry may work directly with UMIN staff in developing a ministry vision into a viable and sustainable Program within UMIN. UMIN Ministry Programs are specific programs that grow out of interests of students who are actively engaged in UMIN offices (Catholic Campus Ministry, Office of Religious Diversity and Vincentian Community Service Office). These Programs are developed in close consultation with UMIN staff and are supported by a specific UMIN office. GENERAL PROTOCOL AND STANDARDS All UMIN Ministry Programs, SROs, DCSA-SOs and Affiliate Groups follow specific protocol and high standards, which are critical to the establishment and on-going recognition of religious, faith, spiritual and Vincentian service activities on campus. University Ministry staff will work closely with each Organization, Program or Group to ensure that these guidelines are followed. (In rare instances a Group or Organization will no longer be allowed to function on campus because it does not adhere to the guidelines, the University mission and vision or the policies, procedures, protocol and expectations defined by OSI, UMIN or the University.) The protocol and standards follow: 1. All are student initiated and led. In keeping with DePaul's OSI policies, formation of all UMIN Organizations, Groups or Programs are to be initiated by students. Students interested in forming a new Organization, Group or Program must first contact a UMIN staff person to discuss their vision and intentions. 2. All are directed by DePaul's mission, vision and Policies and Procedures. As part of UMIN all spiritual, faith, religious and Vincentian service Organizations, Groups or Programs on campus will embrace the Vincentian mission, function out of the institution's value system, follow the Protocol and Standards set forth by DePaul University Ministry and adhere to the Policies and Procedures proceeding from the University and the Office of Student Involvement. 3. All are guided by the unique nature of the Group, Organization or Program. University Ministry at DePaul encourages students to develop faith, spiritual or religious Organizations, Groups or Programs that will best meet their needs. However, in an effort to eliminate duplication of services UMIN staff will first work with students to determine if are/can needs be met through Organizations, Groups or Programs already established on campus. If this is the case, UMIN staff will encourage and assist interested students in involvement in established Organizations, Programs or Groups. If a particular ministry, faith, spiritual or Vincentian service need is not already being met on campus UMIN staff will guide students in appropriate directions for developing their unique vision. 4. All are engaged with UMIN. Members of religious, faith, spiritual or Vincentian service Groups, Organizations and Programs on campus are part of the UMIN community. It is the expectation that leaders (and other members) of Groups, Programs and Organizations will recognize their connection to University Ministry by engaging in the broader UMIN community activities and events. While many opportunities for student engagement in the larger UMIN community exist, UMIN student leaders are expected to participate in: \u009fUMIN Student Leader Retreat (fall quarter) \u009f ORD Quarterly Inter-religious Celebrations (QIRC ) \u009fVCSO Vincentian Service Day (spring quarter) \u009fAdditional training, programming and activities as specified within each UMIN office.

LEADERSHIP In keeping with DePaul's mission to \"expand and develop purposeful co-curricular activities to promote leadership, civic engagement, cultural awareness and personal and spiritual development,\" primary leadership within campus spiritual, faith, religious and Vincentian service Groups, Organizations and Programs belongs to the students. In the spirit of St. Vincent de Paul, the university community works together to challenge students to identify and live consistently with their values; build healthy relationships and take the perspective of others into consideration when making choices; contribute to the campus and broader communities and promote the common good; think critically and make informed and ethical decisions; and strive for excellence in all they do. (For more information on DePaul's Socially Responsible Leadership Framework and its five dimensions, visit http://studentaffairs.depaul.edu/sli/about/framework.asp.) In keeping with the university's commitment to promoting socially responsible leaders and in order to assist student leaders to lead successfully, OSI and UMIN provide numerous opportunities for leadership development. The ways in which student leaders are identified and serve will vary within the different Groups, Programs or Organizations: Student Religious Organization Leadership Student Leaders Student Religious Organization leaders will be determined in accordance with the requirements of OSI (See Org Sync). In addition, SROs may be required to fill additional leadership roles by specific UMIN offices. SRO leaders will be required to participate in and promote UMIN activities and events as well as leadership development opportunities offered by UMIN and Student Affairs and by specific UMIN offices with which the leaders are associated. The following are UMIN activities and events in which SRO student leaders are required to participate: \u009fUMIN Student Leader Retreat (fall quarter) \u009f ORD Quarterly Inter-religious Celebrations (QIRC ) \u009fVCSO Vincentian Service Day (spring quarter) \u009fAdditional training, programming and activities as specified within each UMIN office (Consult with CCM or ORD staff). External Leaders In a few instances external leaders from local faith or worshipping communities, groups, para-church organizations or national/international programs may be invited by students and approved by UMIN staff to work with a campus spiritual, faith, religious Groups, Programs or SROs. Regular and on-going (at least once a quarter) external leadership within a campus spiritual, faith, religious Organization, Program or Group is limited to advising and consulting. Students always maintain primary leadership roles in determining the direction, focus and implementation of activities and events of their Group, Organization or Program. Approved external leaders are referred to as Community Ministry Associates (paid by external entities to support DePaul students) or Community Ministry Volunteers (non-paid volunteers). Community Ministry Associates (CMAs) and Community Ministry Volunteers (CMVs) must be vetted by UMIN staff prior to any contact with students on campus. The vetting process includes but may not be limited to: \u009fa formal (annual) meeting between the CMA/CMV and UMIN staff. \u009freview of an annual registration form that includes a Felony Certification as required by the University Office of General Counsel. Upon UMIN approval CMAs ad CMVs must adhere to specific DePaul University policies and procedures and UMIN Protocol and Standards for External Leadership (See Appendix III). Community Ministry Associates and Volunteers must be invited by students to help support the SRO and may not impose themselves upon the student Organization or students themselves. (Please refer to Appendix III, UMIN Protocol and Standards for External Leadership). External leaders are always encouraged to not only attend signature UMIN events but they are required to promote attendance at events by SRO leaders and members. The following UMIN activities are to be attended by all SRO leaders and CMAs and CMVs are strongly encouraged to attend the bolded events; \u009fUMIN Student Leader Retreat (fall Inter-religious Celebrations (QIRC ) \u009fVCSO Vincentian Service Day (spring quarter) \u009fAdditional training, programming and activities as specified within each UMIN office (Consult with UMIN staff). University Advisors Every SRO must have a DePaul faculty or staff advisor whose primary purpose is to advise, guide and educate the group on specific issues relating to the university. A UMIN staff member will always serve as the primary SRO or DCSA-SO advisor and will be listed as the advisor on OSI registration forms and the Organization's Org Sync page. A secondary faculty or staff advisor may also work with the Organization. Student leaders must consult annually with UMIN staff regarding faculty or staff advising. A secondary faculty or staff advisor may advise and guide the group on pertinent religious, faith or spiritual matters. Faculty or staff advisors will follow the guidelines provided by OSI and are encouraged to participate in training events provided by OSI (See Org Sync). DCSA Service Organization Leadership Student Leaders DCSA Service Organization leaders will be determined in accordance with the requirements of VCSO (Consult with staff) and OSI (See Org Sync--Constitutions). Also, DCSA-SO leaders are required to participate in and promote UMIN activities and events as well as leadership development opportunities offered by UMIN, OSI and VCSO. The following are UMIN activities and events in which DCSA-SO student leaders are required to participate: \u009fUMIN Student Leader Retreat (fall quarter) \u009f ORD Quarterly Inter-religious Celebrations (QIRC ) \u009fVCSO Vincentian Service Day (spring quarter) \u009fAdditional training, programming and activities as specified by VCSO (Consult with staff). University Advisors Every DCSA-SO must have a DePaul faculty or staff advisor whose primary purpose is to advise, guide and educate the group on specific issues relating to the university. A VCSO staff member will always serve as the DCSA-SO advisor and will be listed as the advisor on OSI registration forms and the Organization's Org Sync page. Staff advisors will follow the guidelines provided by OSI and are encouraged to participate in training events provided by OSI (See Org Sync). Affiliate Group Leadership Leadership within Affiliate Groups comes from students alone who consult with UMIN staff. Students will organize themselves in a way that is consistent with the needs of the Group and in keeping with the policies and procedures of the University, the Office of Student Involvement and the Protocol and Standards of University Ministry. It is highly recommended that Affiliate Group leaders who anticipate moving the Group into a UMIN Ministry Program, SRO or DCSA-SO actively participate in the following UMIN activities: \u009fUMIN Student Leader Retreat (fall Inter-religious Celebrations (QIRC ) \u009fVCSO Vincentian Service Day (spring quarter) \u009fAdditional training, programming and activities as specified within each UMIN office. UMIN Ministry Program Leadership Student leaders for UMIN Ministry Programs will be selected/appointed/hired according to the UMIN office with which the program is connected. Like all leaders within UMIN, students leading or assisting in leadership of UMIN Ministry Programs will be required to participate in UMIN activities and events as well as in leadership development opportunities offered by UMIN, OSI and the particular UMIN office with which the leaders are associated. Student leaders within UMIN Ministry Programs are required to participate in the following: \u009fUMIN Student Leader Retreat (fall quarter) \u009f ORD Quarterly Inter-religious Celebrations (QIRC ) \u009fVCSO Vincentian Service Day (spring quarter) \u009fAdditional training, programming and activities as specified within CCM and ORD. (Contact CCM or ORD staff for details) ACCOUNTABILITY UMIN Ministry Programs, SROs, DCSA-SOs and Affiliate Groups (participants and student leaders, Community Ministry Associates and Community Ministry Volunteers) will adhere to University Policy, University Ministry Protocol and Standards and the OSI Standards of Accountability (See Org Sync). Failure to adhere to these policies, procedures, standards, protocol and expectations will result in learning resolutions determined and administered by the University, University Ministry and/or the Office of Student Involvement. UMIN Groups, Programs and Organizations, leadership and members are held accountable to all policies, procedures, protocol, expectations and standards by UMIN staff. REGULATION AND LEARNING RESOLUTIONS University Ministry staff recognizes the broken human condition, which may lead on occasion to issues that call for corrective action. University Ministry maintains a pastoral and fiduciary responsibility in such situations to take action in adherence to DePaul's uncompromising commitment to respect the dignity of all human beings. Separate from any action taken by the Office of Student Involvement, Student Government Association and/or the Dean of Students, University Ministry may exercise actions resulting from failure on the part of student leaders, CMAs, CMVs or student participants to adhere to UMIN Protocol and Standards. Learning Resolutions Infractions occur when participants and/or leadership do not comply with University Policies and Procedures, UMIN Protocol and Standards, OSI Policies and Procedures or Standards of Accountability, the Student Handbook or other rules or regulations governing the university; and/or function outside the Vincentian values as reflected in the University Mission Statement. NOTE: For purposes of University Ministry, we find the following points especially important for you to know. Examples of these infractions include but are not limited to UMIN Program, Group or Organization participants and/or leadership engaging in: \u009fDegradation of the dignity of any individual or group. \u009fProselytization or conversionary activities which pressure others to join or participate or which create unsafe, uncomfortable or harmful conditions for the full participation of any or all students (See Appendix IV). \u009fAction or commentary that excludes participation at any level in an Organization, Program or Group. Minor Infraction The following steps will be taken in the case of a minor infraction (as determined by OSI and UMIN staff on a case by case basis): 1. UMIN staff will initiate a conversation between the Group, Organization or Program leadership team, including, when appropriate, any CMA and/or CMV. Additional UMIN and/or OSI staff and/or any other appropriate university representative may be invited into the conversation. The conversation will include an explanation of the area or issue of concern. 2. Specific learning outcomes necessary to remediate the issue will be developed by the leadership of the Group, Program or Organization in consultation with UMIN staff. 3. The Group, Program or Organization will be placed on probation, to last no more than two academic quarters, during which time the leadership will work to successfully achieve learning outcomes. 4. If the learning outcomes are not met within two academic quarters, the Group, Program or Organization will be suspended indefinitely. Any Organization that has its SRO or DCSA-SO status suspended for a minor infraction and having successfully met learning outcomes may reapply for SRO or DCSA-SO recognition after three academic quarters and with reorganization of leadership. Regaining SRO or DCSA-SO recognition will happen only upon approval by UMIN staff in consultation with appropriate university offices. Further minor infraction during probation or subsequent to the initial infraction may result in stronger consequences, up to and including indefinite suspension of the SRO or DCSA-SO or dissolution of the SRO or DCSA-SO. Any Group that has been suspended for a minor infraction will not be allowed to continue functioning on campus. Any Program that has been suspended for a minor infraction may resume upon the approval of scrutiny of UMIN staff. Major Infraction Major infractions may include but are not limited to: \u009fRepeated offenses regarding proselytization, degradation or exclusionary practices. \u009fNeglect in successfully meeting learning outcomes developed to resolve minor infractions. \u009fNon-compliant activities as determined by staff from OSI and UMIN in consultation with the Dean of Students and other offices as necessary. In the case of a major infraction, SRO or DCSA-SO recognition will be immediately suspended and the SRO or DCSA-SO may be dissolved. If an SRO or DCSA-SO is dissolved due to a major infraction, the Organization will not be permitted to reorganize or apply for future SRO or DCSA-SO recognition. INITIAL ESTABLISHMENT OF UMIN GROUPS, ORGANIZATIONS AND PROGRAMS Student interest, need and initiation are always the primary motivations for establishing an SRO, DCSA-SO, Affiliate Group or UMIN Ministry Program. All Organizations, Groups and Programs can only be established in consultation and collaboration with UMIN staff who will provide direction and guide students through proper channels for establishing an Organization, Group or Program. UMIN staff conversations are ALWAYS the launching grounds for establishment of any new spiritual, religious, faith or Vincentian service activity on campus. Students interested in establishing a new faith, spiritual, religious or Vincentian service activity on campus must consult with UMIN staff PRIOR to beginning SRO or DCSA-SO registration processes through OSI or PRIOR to meeting with or recruiting others for involvement. Staff, upon meeting with students, will guide and direct students through proper channels if establishment of a new Group, Program or Organization is feasible. NOTE: For purposes of University Ministry, we also find the following points especially important for you to know. \u009fIndividuals or communities, groups or programs external to DePaul may not initiate formation of SROs, DCSA-SOs, UMIN Ministry Programs or Affiliate Groups or ANY spiritual, faith or religious activity on campus. \u009fSolicitation, evangelizing or recruitment of DePaul students by individuals or communities, groups or programs external to DePaul for the purpose of establishing religious, spiritual, faith or service activities on campus are in keeping with DePaul University's non-solicitation policies and are strictly prohibited. \u009fIndividuals or communities, groups or programs external to DePaul are not allowed to sponsor, lead, guide or publicize spiritual, faith or religious events or activities on campus. This includes conversations/activities (such as scripture studies) that purport to be \"informal\" but are being led by students who have been trained to recruit members for external organizations. For example, using any training techniques or materials intrinsic to sharing the beliefs of the external entity or individual. See Appendix IV or more details. ANNUAL REVIEW AND RECOGNITION All UMIN Organizations, Programs and Groups will be reviewed annually by student leaders in collaboration with UMIN staff. The review may focus on the following: \u009fMeeting of annual goals. \u009fAdherence to SRO or DCSA-SO constitutions. \u009fAdherence to University mission and values. \u009fAdherence to UMIN, OSI and University policies, procedures, standards, protocol and expectations. \u009fConsideration of the continued need for or sustainability of the Organization, Program or Group. \u009fDevelopment of strategies or goals for moving forward or dissolving the Organization, Program or Group. In addition, the following may be taken into account by UMIN staff in considering whether or not a Group, Organization or Program will continue to function on campus: \u009fLeadership participation in UMIN sponsored training/leadership development events and activities through the year. These events and activities will be shared with student leaders during the annual (or initial) meeting with UMIN staff. \u009fActivities and participation were actively recorded and reported throughout the year. \u009fLeadership and members participated in required UMIN events throughout the year. These events are listed under General Protocol and Standard, Item 4. SROs and DCSA-SOs All SROs and DCSA-SOs must register annually with UMIN and OSI in order to maintain status as a registered Student Religious Organization. The following points may be helpful to keep in mind as the annual registration process is considered: \u009fThe first step in the annual registration process is meeting with UMIN staff and completing the registration process relevant to each UMIN office (Consult with UMIN staff for details). \u009fEach UMIN office may have specific annual registration procedures and requirements. These will be shared with student leaders during the meeting with UMIN staff. \u009fUpon approval by UMIN staff, SROs and DCSA-SOs may re-apply through OSI in order to maintain its status as a registered organization. \u009fAny Organization that has not been first approved by UMIN may begin the annual registration with OSI but the registration will by denied by UMIN staff. \u009fDetails for annual registration with OSI are found on Org Sync with regular updates posted. Staying connected through Org Sync will help student leaders meet deadlines, plan for training, etc. Affiliate Groups Following the annual review, UMIN staff in consultation with Group student leaders may decide to: \u009fDissolve the Group at the end of the current academic year. \u009fContinue the Group for a designated amount of time (maximum of one additional year). \u009fMove the Group in SRO, DCSA-SO or UMIN Ministry Program status. UMIN staff will guide and direct Groups through the review, dissolution or continuation processes. UMIN Ministry Programs UMIN Ministry Programs continue as determined by UMIN staff in consultation with students. SCHEDULING ACTIVITIES Leaders and members of UMIN Organizations, Groups or Programs agree to engage in the broader UMIN programs, events and activities. To this end student leaders agree to: \u009fRefrain from scheduling events on the same dates or times as UMIN key events such as the Vincentian Service Day, UMIN retreats or training events, Quarterly Inter-religious Celebrations or other activities or events indicated by specific UMIN offices. \u009fMake every effort to schedule around other UMIN events open to the larger community such as but not limited to the Annual MLK Worship Celebration, Fast-a-thon, Ecumenical Epiphany and Pentecost celebrations, Inter-faith Seder, etc. \u009fParticipate in UMIN activities as described above and including leadership \u009fActively invite and accompany Group, Program or Organization members to UMIN activities as described above. All activities and events of Groups, Organizations and Programs will be consistently congruent with Vincentian traditions and the mission and values of the University (See DePaul Mission Statement). Leaders and participants will adhere to University Policy, UMIN Protocol and Standards, OSI Standards of Accountability and the Student Handbook. Funding for events or activities will be determined by the nature of the Program, Group or Organization and in consultation with UMIN staff.

Appendix II Travel and UMIN Van Usage All UMIN student leaders are required to adhere to the travel policies of the University if they are engaged in any type of travel related to DePaul. (See University Policies http://policies.depaul.edu/policy/policy.aspx?pid=109) International Travel Any UMIN Group, Program or Organization planning international travel for any reason must abide by university policies and procedures. See DePaul Policies and Procedures for international travel details. https://international.depaul.edu/IndependentTravel/index.asp Any UMIN Group, Program or Organization planning any international travel must first consult with UMIN staff at least six months prior to the planned travel. NOTE: All DCM related SROs are required to provide a copy of international travel registration to DCM staff three weeks prior to travel. Domestic Travel DePaul University has very specific Policies and Procedures governing all aspects of domestic travel related to the University. These Policies and Procedure cover the following types of travel: \u009fTravel using personal vehicle \u009fTravel using university vehicle (UMIN vans) \u009fPublic transportation. Personal or University Vehicle Use For full details regarding use of personal or university vehicles for university purposes see Policies and Procedures: http://policies.depaul.edu/policy/policy.aspx?pid=109. Following are limited details for domestic travel. Local & Non-Local Travel Local travel is travel within the Chicago land area (Cook, DuPage, Kane, Lake, McHenry, and Will counties). Non-local travel is travel outside the Chicago land area (Cook, DuPage, Kane, Lake, McHenry, and Will counties). If students are traveling outside the Chicago land area, anyone driving their own vehicle, a rented vehicle or a university vehicle must adhere to the following: \u009fRequires driver over the age of 21. \u009fPassengers (staff or students who are not a University certified driver) must sign a travel waiver (see below for more information on travel waivers. \u009fTravel waivers must be submitted to UMIN staff one week prior to travel. Waivers can be found in Org Sync Forms. Required Travel Waivers Passengers (who are not University certified drivers) engaging in Non-Local Travel in a University Vehicle, a Personal Vehicle for University Business, or other transportation provided by or arranged by the University (for example a chartered or rented vehicle, or public transportation) for University Business must sign a travel waiver approved by the Office of the General Counsel. Travel waivers can be found at Org Sync Forms. These waivers must be submitted to UMIN staff a minimum of one week prior to travel. Any students planning on traveling for any UMIN purpose within or beyond Chicago-land must inform UMIN staff early in the planning process (a minimum of four weeks prior to travel) so that staff can support and advise the group in their preparations. UMIN staff will archive all travel forms (waivers, international travel registration, domestic travel registration) for two years as indicated by University General Counsel. Van Rentals Any UMIN Group, Program or Organization planning on renting a van for use must consult with UMIN in the early planning stages (a minimum of four weeks prior to travel) of the anticipated trip. UMIN staff (all Offices) must consult with Office of Risk Management (Mary Joyce Cometa) for insurance information prior to renting a vehicle. The Office of Risk Management may deem it necessary to deny van rental by any UMIN Group, Program or Organization. Driver Responsibilities Drivers are required to: \u009f Ensure that University vehicles are only used for University business--this includes not transporting any unauthorized passengers such as family, friends, or hitchhikers. Adhere to all driving laws applicable to the location, including those related to mobile device usage. Current Illinois law prohibits drivers from using a mobile device to text, email or surf the internet while driving, and also prohibits talking on a cell phone while in a construction work zone or school zone. Inspect a University vehicle before and after driving the University vehicle for safety concerns, and report any defects immediately to the supervisor of the department to UMIN staff. Immediately report all fines or traffic violations received while driving a University vehicle to the supervisor of the department to which the University vehicle is assigned (UMIN staff) and to the Office of Risk Management and Environmental Health & Safety. Not permit anyone who has not successfully completed the Driver Certification process maintained by the Office of Risk Management and Environmental Health and Safety to operate a University vehicle or a personal vehicle that is being used for University business. Allow no more than 10 occupants per vehicle, including the driver (fifteen-person passenger vans that are University vehicles or personal vehicles being used for University business must have the backseat of the van removed). Require all occupants of a University vehicle or personal vehicle that is being used for University business to wear a seat belt. Report all accidents involving University vehicles or personal vehicles that are being used for University business on-campus to Public Safety and to the UMIN office and report all accidents involving University vehicles or personal vehicles that are being used for University business that occur off- campus to the local police where the accident occurred and to the UMIN office. IMPORTANT NOTE: If a University vehicle is involved in ANY type of accident (including scraping side of van in parking lot) the DRIVER MUST CONTACT THE LOCAL PUBLIC POLICE DEPARTMENT, FILE A REPORT WITH THE POLICE DEPARTMENT AND SUBMIT A COPY OF THE FILED REPORT TO UNIVERSITY PUBLIC SAFETY. UMIN Van Usage - FAQ's All UMIN student leaders within DCSA-Service Organizations, UMIN Ministry Programs, Student Religious Organizations and Affiliate Groups have limited access to UMIN vans. Who may use the vans? University Ministry (UMIN) van usage is restricted to UMIN and only those Groups, Programs or Organizations that have a clear and specific connection with UMIN. University organizations and groups that do not specifically relate to UMIN as a UMIN Ministry Program, Affiliate Group, Student Religious Organization or DCSA-Service Organization are not allowed access to UMIN vans. How can I check the schedule for van availability? Scheduling preference is given to the DCSA-SOs. The DCSA-SO service schedule is generally mapped out two weeks prior to the start of each quarter. UMIN related Organizations, Groups or Programs can check on availability of the vans at the UMIN reception desk, Suite 311, Lincoln Park Student Center. How do I reserve a van? Reservations can be made only by university drivers who are certified by the university (see \"How do I get certified?\" below). If a van is available, please ask the UMIN receptionist in Suite 311, Student Center to request van usage from appropriate UMIN staff. If UMIN staff approves van usage the UMIN reception staff in UMIN office, Suite 311, Lincoln Park Student Center will assist in finalizing necessary documentation. How do I get certified by the university to use the van? All drivers who will be driving University Vehicles or who will be driving students in personal vehicles for University business must participate in a driver certification process maintained by the Office of Risk Management and Environmental Health & Safety. The driver certification process is initiated by filling out a \"Motor Vehicle Form\" available on the Office of Risk Management and Environmental Health & Safety website: http://rmehs.depaul.edu. This Driver Certification process will include: \u009f A check of the driver's driving record. The cost of this will be charged back to the UMIN SRO of DCSA-SO. The Organization must have a financial account set up with OSI and must have adequate funds available to accommodate the charge back. In some cases UMIN offices MAY cover the costs of the driving record check. However, this must be verified PRIOR to proceeding with the record check. \u009f An on-line driver training program. Drivers will be notified within 4-5 business days if they successfully completed the driver certification process. The driver certification must be complete prior to checking on van availability. What must van drivers and passengers due to comply with University Policies prior to travel? DePaul University has very specific guidelines for students, faculty and staff regarding use of personal, rented or university vehicles for university purposes. Prior to using the UMIN van, rental or personal vehicles for university business drivers must become familiar with the guidelines within this document and those found at http://rmehs.depaul.edu/Contribution%20Folder/Documents/driver%20policy%202012%20use.pdf. Are there any restrictions on travel distances? Travel is not restricted outside of the Chicago land area if using public, personal or rented transportation. However, only university-approved drivers who are 21 years of age or older may drive during \"non-local travel.\" (see \"Local and Non-local\" above). Use of UMIN vans outside a 90 mile radius of the Lincoln Park campus is prohibited. How/where do I get the van/keys? The vans are located in the university parking lot below the \"El\" tracks. Vans must be returned to the exact location from which they were retrieved.

Appendix III UMIN Protocol and Standards for External Leadership Community Ministry Associates and Community Ministry Volunteers These Protocol and Standards support DePaul University Policies that require all student Organizations, Programs and Groups be guided by the needs and interests of students. Student Contacts, Solicitation, Evangelization or Outreach Members of community religious or spiritual organizations (congregations, temples, synagogues, para-church organizations, etc.) are not allowed to recruit or solicit DePaul students for involvement in activities, events, programs or ritual (worship, prayer, liturgies) associated with their religious or spiritual organization. This does not preclude posting of appropriately approved bulletin board posters. Such approval MUST be obtained by UMIN first and then by OSI. Contact the Director of the Office of Religious Diversity or the Protestant Chaplain. Use of DePaul logos on any flyer, letterhead, posters, advertisement, websites, etc. is not allowed. Community members are not allowed to solicit DePaul students, faculty or staff for recruitment of other students for the purpose of establishing a religious or spiritual organization, group or program on campus or for encouraging participation in an off-campus or campus activity sponsored by an external individual or entity. Any individuals representing an off-campus, external religious or spiritual organization with interest in engaging DePaul students in ministry on campus or in establishing a new Student Religious Organization, Affiliated Group or Ministry Program must meet with University Ministry Staff before engaging with students, faculty or staff regarding their intentions. Failure to set-up such a meeting prior to any engagement on campus with students, faculty or staff will result in the individuals' immediate dismissal from campus as well as refusal of consideration of future requests for access to students, faculty and staff on campus. (DePaul University Ministry provides guidelines for appropriate outreach on campus. See Appendix IV.) External Leadership Defined In a few instances external leaders from local faith or worshipping communities, groups, para-church organizations and/or national/international programs may be invited by students and approved by UMIN staff to regularly work with campus spiritual, faith, religious Groups, Programs or Student Religious Organizations. Regular work with students refers to meeting with students on campus for the purpose of advising and guiding at least once a quarter and is only permitted once approved by UMIN staff. Approved external leaders are referred to as \u009fCommunity Ministry Associates (paid by external entities to support DePaul students) OR \u009fCommunity Ministry Volunteers (non-paid volunteers). Vetting and Reviews of CMAs and CMVs Community Ministry Associates (CMAs) and Community Ministry Volunteers (CMVs) must be vetted by UMIN staff prior to any contact with students on campus. The vetting process includes but may not be limited to: \u009fA formal meeting between the CMA/CMV and UMIN staff. \u009fReview of an annual Community Ministry Associate/Volunteer Registration Form that includes a Felony Certification as required by the University Office of General Counsel. This form will be provided to the potential CMA or CMV during the vetting meeting. In addition to the initial vetting process, an annual review of each CMA and CMV will take place at least two weeks prior to the beginning of each academic year. At this time an annual Community Ministry Associate/Volunteer Registration Form and Felony Certification will be provided and processed. UMIN staff will determine on a case-by-case basis which potential external leaders may initially work or continue working with DePaul students as CMAs or CMVs. The determination will be based in part upon: \u009fThe ability of the external leader to support and guide rather than lead the Group or Organization. \u009fThe need for such leadership as determined by students and staff. \u009fThe congruency of the group/ministry/program mission and values and practice with Vincentian values and the mission of DePaul University. \u009fIndividual adherence to University Policies, mission, vision and UMIN Protocol and Expectations. \u009fA sense of true partnership and mutual respect between the CMA/CMV, students and UMIN staff. Standards for CMAs and CMVs University Ministry staff hold all CMAs and CMVs to the high standards that are part of the fabric of UMIN and the University. Following are expectations that uphold this standard and the Vincentian nature of spiritual, faith and religious activities on campus: Community Ministry Associates will support UMIN mission, vision and values in the following ways: \u009fCMAs and CMVs will extravagantly welcome persons from all walks of life and faith traditions, encouraging one another in their faith journeys. \u009fCMAs and CMVs will conduct their work in the manner of St. Vincent DePaul and uphold the mission and vision of DePaul University. CMAs and CMVs will be familiar with these things which can be found on the DePaul website. \u009fCMAs and CMVs must adhere to all DePaul University policies and procedures, Office of Student Involvement Standards of Accountability and UMIN Protocol and Standards. CMAs and CMVs will be familiar with policies, procedures, standards, protocol and expectations. These can be found on DePaul's website or made available by UMIN staff. \u009fCMAs and CMVs will not impose themselves upon the Student Religious Organization with which they work or upon individual students by engaging students in any spiritual, religious or faith conversations or activities unless invited by the student(s). Specifically this means that CMAs and CMVs will refrain from proselytizing or conversionary activities at any time. \u009fCMAs and CMVs will allow students to lead, while providing support and guidance in all activities on campus including guidance in the annual registration and/or review processes outlined by UMIN or the Office of Student Involvement. Specifically, CMAs and CMVs will consistently encourage student-oriented and student-driven leadership for all programs, events, studies, etc. \u009fCMVs and CMAs are encouraged to not only attend signature UMIN events but they are required to promote attendance at events by SRO leaders and members. The following UMIN activities are to be attended by all SRO leaders and CMAs and CMVs are strongly encouraged to attend the bolded events; \u009fUMIN Student Leader Retreat Celebrations (QIRC ) \u009fVCSO Vincentian Service Day (spring quarter). In addition, CMAs and CMVs will actively encourage students to participate in UMIN service and mission immersion experiences, educational programs, retreats and worship, etc. \u009fCMAs and CMVs agree to meet with UMIN staff at least once a quarter but more often if deemed necessary by UMIN staff. These may be one on one meetings or meetings with larger communities and invitations to the meetings will come from UMIN staff. Active and regular participation for the sake of leadership development, fellowship and information sharing is required. \u009fCMAs and CMVs will actively encourage students to work collaboratively with other ecumenical and inter-religious Groups, Organizations and Programs within UMIN as well as with UMIN staff. This includes active encouragement of student leaders for participation in UMIN leadership opportunities, meetings, retreats, etc. \u009fCMAs and CMVs will consistently guide student leaders in providing UMIN and OSI with appropriate annual documentation, learning outcomes, and evaluations. \u009fCMAs and CMVs will complete an annual Community Ministry Associate/Volunteer Registration Form and Felony Certification which will be reviewed and archived by UMIN staff. \u009fCMAs and CMVs understand that oversight for their work with students on campus is the responsibility of UMIN staff who will meet with the CMA or CMV for an annual review and registration, which will happen at least two weeks prior to the beginning of each academic year. UMIN Support of CMAs and CMVs Community Ministry Associates and Community Ministry Volunteers will be supported by UMIN staff in the following ways: Respect and honor for different theological/religious/spiritual perspectives and traditions. Mentorship, support, and development as faith-filled leaders. Partnership for recruitment, marketing, promotion and program planning. Advocacy within UMIN and the wider university community. Information sharing. Other External Leaders At times University Ministry staff may invite members from congregations, synagogues, ministries, programs or groups external to DePaul to assist with specific religious, spiritual or faith leadership roles on campus. These leaders will be held to DePaul's high standards and work within the parameters of Vincentian values and the mission of the University. These external leaders might assist with UMIN sponsored events such as but not limited to Jewish High Holy Days, the MLK Worship Celebration, guest speaker for student study groups or weekly worship, hosts for occasional meals, etc. Appendix IV Proselytizing vs. Evangelizing Proselytizing and Conversionary Activities and Outreach Activities NOTE: Because proselytizing and evangelizing are often subjective, it is important for all who believe they are engaging in evangelism to carefully choose words, monitor the situation and refrain from aggressive or harmful behavior. ANY student who FEELS threatened in any way by another may report the threat to Public Safety and University Ministry staff. As some groups who proselytize have a difficult time understanding what DePaul encourages around evangelism we have provided some detailed information below. Proselytizing Evangelizing The word PROSELYTIZE derives from the Greek and means \"come forward.\" The word EVANGELIZE comes from the Greek and refers to \"sharing the good news.\" Proselytizing is an aggressive attempt to convert others to one's religious or set of beliefs or practices. Evangelizing is an attempt to share one's religion through relationship and sharing that which brings life. Proselytizing is illegal in some countries and forbidden by the US military because it is deemed threatening to others. Evangelizing is practiced throughout the world and emphasizes care and respect for the other. Proselytizers often prey on those on the margins, those distressed and targets certain cultural groups. Evangelizers honor the cultures of others and respects those on the margins and those suffering. Proselytizing involves persuasive and aggressive language and attitude. Evangelizing is non-threatening and involves open and honest conversation and a welcoming attitude. Proselytizing is highly coercive and creates a sense of threat, lack of safety or discomfort for the other. Evangelizing is non-threatening and if discomfort is present it is recognized and honored. Proselytizing is argumentative. It does not respect the dignity of others or religious freedom. Evangelizing allows others to express their beliefs and practices and is always respectful. Proselytizing is judgmental in nature and often employs guilt, emotional blackmail and/or maneuvering to succeed in conversion. Evangelism is inviting, transparent, uses a \"no strings attached\" approach and never offers threats of severe consequences if the invitation is not accepted. In proselytizing the other is always wrong and will ultimately be condemned for this. Evangelization always respects the beliefs of others and never indicates that they are wrong in their beliefs. Proselytizers find and articulate faults of others' faith, community or beliefs and practices. Evangelizers affirm others' faith, community, beliefs or practices. Proselytizing often begins with one message or tactic and changes to another as in a \"bait and switch\" situation. Evangelizing is always open, honest, forthright and consistently transparent. Proselytizing is considered derogatory because of its disrespectful, dishonest and close-minded nature. Evangelizing MAY be considered derogatory when evangelizers are insistent or pushy. Those evangelizing try to remain open to knowing when \"enough is enough.\" Through proselytizing, conversion is the result of aggressive persuasion. Through evangelism, conversion is the result of authentic relationship, open discourse and a change of heart. The following are examples of conversionary tactics known as proselytizing which are not allowed at DePaul: \"Your church/community has problems. It is being surrounded by evil because it is sinful.\" In extreme cases the one trying to convert might even ridicule and scoff at the other's beliefs and community. These are unkind, disrespectful and most often dishonest commentary about the other person's beliefs and practices. \"MY church is growing and people are on fire. You can be part of that instead of struggling with a church that is so sinful and lacking in good leadership.\" Often the one trying to convert will find out where/if the other is engaged in a spiritual practice or community already. If so, the proselytizer will compare the two communities even if they have no idea what the other community might look like or truly believe. If they do know the community or faith, they will speak about all of its flaws. \"If you join us you will find joy and be part of a community that will always be there for you. If you don't you will always be searching and you will be condemned. You'll never find peace. You'll never succeed. All your problems are the result of your bad path.\" This is emotional violence and psychological abuse. This type of moral exploitation can be very convincing but extremely harmful. \"By sharing your student loan money you will find hope and salvation. Giving is a sign of your commitment to a new life. You will be rewarded.\" The request for money or social connections doesn't usually come up immediately but insistence on sharing wealth and resources even later in a relationship is always an indicator of manipulation. \"In this community you will be surrounded by like-minded people. We will find you a roommate who will practice as you do and you will never be alone. We even have many who are hoping to find a partner for life.\" One of the goals with extreme groups is to enmesh the community so that the sense of belonging and commitment to the community will not be shaken. These tactics usually come later in the conversion process but should always strike concern. \"It must be really difficult being...(Asian/Black/Hispanic/Poor/Lonely/YOU NAME IT!) You don't need to feel alone. I'm here for you and I have a community that will love you and care for you.\" Proselytizing is often aimed at those who are perceived to be on the fringes. Student with a sad demeanor, sitting alone in Brownstones, studying alone in the library, eating alone, appearing to be lost on campus are examples of prime targets. Often foreign students and those who exhibit marginalization are targeted. People in distress are often good targets also. \"Hi! Would you like to grab a cup of coffee and get to know each other?\" This is problematic if the person inviting the other has a hidden agenda such as sharing their faith or recruiting for a faith, spiritual or religious group on or off campus. However, if the agenda is clearly indicated in the invitation the other person has the opportunity to decline or accept the invitation AND the agenda. TRANSPARENCY is key! Transparency in personal verbal invitations as well as through any media is critical.
