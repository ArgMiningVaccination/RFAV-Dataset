Section Dividers: Prepared by the Tennessee Department of General Services, Printing and Media Services Division.Bill Haslam, Governor The Government Finance Officers Association of the United States and Canada (GFOA) presented a Distinguished Budget Presentation Award to the State of Tennessee for the Annual Budget beginning July 1, 2013. In order to receive this award, a governmental unit must publish a budget document that meets program criteria as a policy document, as an operations guide, as a financial plan, and as a communications device. The award is valid for a period of one year only.

This budget was developed in a national economy that continues to struggle. As a result, it was necessary to recommend adjustments to the current fiscal year 2014 budget to reflect a lowered revenue estimate. The fiscal year 2015 budget assumes nominal revenue growth. For funding increases, I am recommending funding increases for program and inflationary growth in TennCare as well as the K-12 Basic Education Program funding formula. I am also recommending strategic investments in education, economic development and capital outlay; all of which are detailed in this document. To remain balanced, the budget reduces recurring funding for state programs by 2.4 percent. Although difficult, reductions were carefully determined to minimize the impact on important government programs and services. Lastly, I am recommending the rainy day fund reserve be increased by almost 9 percent to $496.3 million. This budget reflects the many challenges and opportunities we are all facing. My staff and I look forward to working with you on this and other important issues in the upcoming legislative session. Sincerely, Bill Haslam BILL HASLAM GOVERNOR STATE OF TENNESSEE STATE CAPIT , TN 37243-0001 x PH: 615\u00b7741\u00b72001 x www.tn.gov February 2014 To the members of the 108th General Assembly: I am pleased submit to you the fiscal year 2015 Budget for the State of Tennessee.

My staff and I look forward to working with you on this and other important issues in the upcoming legislative session. Sincerely, Bill Haslam State of Tennessee Budget Highlights Recommended Budget, Fiscal Year 2014-2015 The total recommended state budget for 2014-2015 is $32.6 billion, with $ 15billion from state appropriations, $12.9 billion from federal funds, and $4.7 billion from other departmental revenues, higher education student tuition and fees, and bonds for cap italprojects and facilities revolving fund capital outlay. This is a decrease of $642 .1million in total funding and $131.3 million in state funding from the revised 2013-2014 spending estimates. Mid-year review of state tax collections and advice from economists and the State Funding Board suggest that current -year estimates of taxes collected by the Department of Revenue should be adjusted down. In the general fund for fiscal year 2013-2014, the revenue estimate decreased by $126.1 million from the or iginally budgeted estimate. The revised current -year growth rate in the general fund is 2.3 percent compared with the actual 2012-2013 Department of Revenue collections. For 2014-2015, before inter -fund reallocations, general fund taxes are expected to grow by $323 million above the revised current -year estimate. This is a 3.25 percent general fund growth rate above the revised current -year estimate. Revenue growth rates are within the range of revenue growth recommended by the State Funding Board.Therevised revenue estimates for the current year and estimates for next year are based on a slow economic recovery through fiscal year 2014-2015 and beyond. Plan for Balancing Supplemental appropriations in 2013-2014 total $ 23.2 million, $15.3 million of which is in the Department of Economic and Community Development and $3 million for property tax relief. In fiscal year 201 4-2015, the budget is balanced, with recurring revenues fully supporting recurring appropriations. This is accomplished by additional budget reductions in fiscal year 2014-2015. Base budgets in general fund programs throughout state government have been reduced by $132.9 million and certain programs have been decreased by $18.8 million for a net recurring base reduction of $151.7 million in the general fund. The average general fund recurring reduction is 2.4 percent. Reductions in programs supporting public safety are minimal or non- existent. (The reductions are detailed in Volume 2: Base Reductions .) Reductions in the TennCare program are $80.2 million, or 60 percent of the recurring, general fund, base budget reductions recommended. TennCare services and programs to be reduced, eliminated, or reformed include: reducing rates paid to medical service providers by 1 percent ($18.5 million ); eliminating the standard spend down Medicaid category, a reduction made possible by the Federally Facilitated Marketplace (FFM) ($ 11.1 million) ; implementing private sector best practices for routine laboratory tests ( $7.2 million); implementing maximum allowable co -pays ($6.7 Cover Tennessee enrollees to the FFM ($6.7 million); reducing the amount the program pays for brand name drugs from 13 percent of average xxi xxi State of Tennessee Budget Highlights Recommended Budget, Fiscal Year 2014-2015 The total recommended state budget for 2014-2015 is $32.6 billion, with $ 15billion from state appropriations, $12.9 billion from federal funds, and $4.7 billion from other departmental revenues, higher education student tuition and fees, and bonds for cap italprojects and facilities revolving fund capital outlay.

Other large reductions in state programs and services include: reducing the allocation of the Basic Education Program (BEP) growth fund by $7.5 million; reducing the amount paid to local jails for housing state felons by increasing capacity in state institutions for a savings of $2.3 million; and closing the New Visions Youth Development Center operated by the Department of Children's Services for a savings of $2.1 million. A total of 620 positions will be abolished as a result of reductions implemented in this request. At this time, approximately 520of these positions are vacant. More than one- half of the position reductions are from two departments: Labor and Workforce Development (173) andHuman Services (15 4). Federal and State Mandates State expenditures in the TennCare program are matched according to a rate set by the federal government known as the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP). The federal government determines this rate for all states based on changes in per-capita income. For fiscal year 201 4-2015, federal participation in health care programs is decreasing from 6 5.500% to 65.065%. This means an increase of $ 32.9 million in state funding to TennCare and $469,300 to the Department of Children's Services for foster care and adoption assistance to maintain the existing level of service in those programs. A total of $ 4million in state funding is required to pay salary increases mandated by state law for certain job classifications within state governmen t. These jobs and the state dollars necessary to fund the required increase sinclude: assistant district attorneys and criminal investigators ($ 1.1 million ), assistant public defenders and criminal investigators ($637,500), assistant post - conviction defenders ($31,800), trooper step increases ($ 828,600) and border- state survey ($607,700) , and wildlife officer step increases ($ 424,200) and survey ($319,600). State law requires annual payments of $600 to local police officers after they complete at least 4 0 hours of in- service training and an increase in the number of officers eligible for the payments under this state mandate is funded with $338,400. State statutes mandate that teachers at the state- run schools must be compensated based on their training and experience. To fund this state mandate, $48,800 is provided to the Department of Children's Services for the Youth Development Centers and $99,300 to the Department of Education's Special Schools.Budget Highlights K-12 Education For K -12 education, the cost to maintain full funding of the Basic Education Program (BEP) formula, which provides an equitable state share of K -12 public education funding to local education agencies (LEAs) , is $46.8 million .The state share of a 2 percent salary increase effective July 1, 2014, for teachers and other positions funded through the BEP formula is funded with $48.6 million. Six months of appropriation for a 5 percent group health insurance adjustment effective January 1, 2015 is provided for with $8 million. Salary equity adjustments are funded with $14.5 million. In total, the state funding for the operations of local school systems will increase by $ 117.9 million after salary and insurance adjustments .An educator evaluation system that helps provide training, certific ation, and coaching resources for districts and schools is funded with $1.3 million. A total appropriation of $10.4 million is provided to fund various grant programs such as: public television stations ($2 .8million non-recurring), the Governor's School s ($1 .9 recurrin g), family resource centers ($3.1 million non-recurring), Alvin C.

Federal and State Mandates State expenditures in the TennCare program are matched according to a rate set by the federal government known as the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP). The federal government determines this rate for all states based on changes in per-capita income. For fiscal year 201 4-2015, federal participation in health care programs is decreasing from 6 5.500% to 65.065%. This means an increase of $ 32.9 million in state funding to TennCare and $469,300 to the Department of Children's Services for foster care and adoption assistance to maintain the existing level of service in those programs.

Detailed Budget Estimates - Estimates of expenditures and revenues, including all funding sources; program statements; statement of the state's bonded indebtedness, detailing redemption requirements until retirement, the net and gross debt of the state, and condition of the sinking fund; and 3. Appropriations Bill and Other Budget Bills - The General Appropriations Bill, through which the General Assembly gives legal sanction to the financial plan it adopts. Upon passage, this bill appropriates by agency and funds the expenditures for the ensuing fiscal year. The revenues by which these expenditures are financed also are detailed in this bill. In addition, other bills required to give legal sanction to the financial plan must be filed. Parts one and two are included in the Budget Document. The format of the Budget Document is reviewed annually for clarity and content. Part three , the Appropriations Bill and other budget legislation, such as the Bond Authorization Bill, are separate documents. The \"Introduction\" section of the Budget Document begins with t ransmittal letters from the Governor to the General Assembly and from the Commissioner of Finance and Administration to the Governor. These letters and the following budget highlights summarize the policy and financial recommendations included in the document. The next section of the Budget Document, entitled \"Budget Overview,\" is a brief summary of the total budget. This overview is a series of charts and schedules that summarize the Budget. The total state budget and the general fund budget are represented by pie charts that detail each major tax and each func tional area for the recommended budget. Tennessee's current tax structure has the m ajority of its tax revenue coming from the sales tax, the largest portion of which funds K-12 education. The over view schedules clarify and detail the e xpenditures, revenue sources, and personnel requirements of state government. The Budget Document has several total budget schedules comparing pr ograms by funding source and showing how those funds are derived. Also i ncluded are tables that list, by department, the cost increases proposed for the next fiscal year. A separate table lists, by department, proposed base budget reductions, indicating the percent of reduction compared with general fund state appropriations and with so -called discretionary appropriations. The discretionary appropriations exclude appropriations from all dedicated taxes and fees, federal aid, and other departmental revenue; and general fund appropriations for the K -12 Basic Education Program (BEP), pre-kindergarten , c onstitutionally and statutorily required salaries of judges, 31 district attorneys general, 31 public defenders, and certain programs affecting indigent or low-income persons.

The \"Introduction\" section of the Budget Document begins with t ransmittal letters from the Governor to the General Assembly and from the Commissioner of Finance and Administration to the Governor. These letters and the following budget highlights summarize the policy and financial recommendations included in the document. The next section of the Budget Document, entitled \"Budget Overview,\" is a brief summary of the total budget. This overview is a series of charts and schedules that summarize the Budget. The total state budget and the general fund budget are represented by pie charts that detail each major tax and each func tional area for the recommended budget. Tennessee's current tax structure has the m ajority of its tax revenue coming from the sales tax, the largest portion of which funds K-12 education. The over view schedules clarify and detail the e xpenditures, revenue sources, and personnel requirements of state government. The Budget Document has several total budget schedules comparing pr ograms by funding source and showing how those funds are derived. Also i ncluded are tables that list, by department, the cost increases proposed for the next fiscal year. A separate table lists, by department, proposed base budget reductions, indicating the percent of reduction compared with general fund state appropriations and with so -called discretionary appropriations. The discretionary appropriations exclude appropriations from all dedicated taxes and fees, federal aid, and other departmental revenue; and general fund appropriations for the K -12 Basic Education Program (BEP), pre-kindergarten , c onstitutionally and statutorily required salaries of judges, 31 district attorneys general, 31 public defenders, and certain programs affecting indigent or low-income persons. Budget Highlights million .A recommended deposit to the fund of $40.3 million in fiscal year 201 4-2015 will have the total revenue fluctuation reserve at $ 496.3 million on June 30, 2015. TennCare Reserve The TennCar e reserve consists of prior -year unspent funds appropriated to the TennCare program. The unobligated reserve , as of June 30, 2013, is estimated at $306.9 million . A closing transfer of $25 million is expected on June 30, 2014, so the balance is projected to be $281.9 million on June 30, 2014. The balance is expected to be the same on June 30, 2015. Conclusion The budget document includes narrative program statements for each of the line -item programs for which funds are recommended. In addition, deta iled statements explain the recommended cost increases .Volume 2: Base Budget Reductions , describes the reductions in recurring funding by program.xxxxxxThe Budget Document There are two charts that provide the total fund ba lance available, indicating the appropriation requirements and the general fund and education fund revenues and reserves available to meet that need: \"General Fund and Education Fund, Comparison of Appropriation Requirements and State Revenues\" for the current year , and next (or recommended budget) year. The two charts show how the budget is balanced against general fund and education fund tax revenues for the two fiscal years. Because of its dedicated funding sources, the Department of Transportation's appropriation requirements and revenue sources are stated on a separate chart. All agencies and departments are included in the summary comparison schedules by program and funding source. Other schedules provide detail on the supplemental appropriations required to maintain programs in the current fiscal year, the Constitutional spending limitation requirement, a su mmary of personnel and funding for all state agencies and higher education instit utions, and Tennessee characteristics, which include demographic and other information on the state. Charts in the overview summarize base budget reductions and base budget adjustments (increases). The charts reflect changes from the current -year work program recurring state appropriations. The overview also includes ch arts summarizing the lottery for education revenue estimates, program requirements funded from the lottery revenue, and lottery reserve fund balances. The section entitled \"State Tax Revenues\" presents state tax revenue estimates for the ensuing fiscal year, compared with actual collections for the previous year and the revised estimate for the current year. This section explains the various sources of revenue, by collecting agency, and the statutory apportionment among the various funds: the general fund, education fund, highway fund, sinking (or debt service) fund, and cities and counties fund. Included in the \"Financial Statements\" section are the comparative balance sheets for the general fund, education fund, and highway fund. This s ection is followed by the expenditures and requirements of the debt service fund for the previous, current, and subse quent fiscal years. A debt service fund comparative balance sheet also is included. The status of the various authorized and unissued bonds is given in a schedule of bonds and appropriations made for capital purposes in lieu of bond issuance. The statement of bonded indebtedness pres ents the retirement schedule for the state's bonded debt. The cost of outstanding bonds is reflected as principal and interest. The proposed capital outlay for the ensuing fiscal year is included within the \"Capital Outlay and Facilities Program\" section. Specific projects are shown for each department impacted, along with capital maintenance. Whether from current funds of the ge neral fund, the sale of general obligation bonds, or from other sources, the proposed funding for each project is indicated. All of the summary charts and program statements in this Budget Document include appropriations from all state sources, both general taxes and dedicated taxes and fees. The major portion of the Budget Document is \"Program Statements by Functional Area.\" For presentation in the Budget Document, departments and agencies with related missions, programs, goals, and objec tives are grouped, resulting in six functional areas. This enables legislators, policy- makers, and citizens to have a bet ter concept of the magnitude and costs of services provided through the various funct ional areas of state government. At the beginning of each functional presentation is an introduction to the The Budget Document associated agencies, followed by a list of the cost increases that are recommended for that area of state government. The cost increase list is followed by tables that show the total expenditures, funding sources , and personnel of each functional area. The activities and responsibilities of the departments and agencies are explained through narrative descriptions of each program. Following this narrative, fiscal and personnel data are provided for the last complet ed year, the current year, and the next year. The next -year estimates include the level of funding and number of positions for the recommended base budget, program cost increases, and the total recommended. Base budget reductions necessary to balance general fund appropriations are included in the recommended base budget of this document by program. The specific base reductions by program are itemized in a separate Volume 2, Base Budget Reductions. Following the \"Program Statements by Functional Area,\" the next- to-last section of the Budget Document is \"Budget Process.\" This section includes explanatory sections entitled \"The Budget Process,\" and \" Basis of Budgeting and Accounting.\" The final section is the \"Glossary and Index.\" xxxi xxxi The Budget Document There are two charts that provide the total fund ba lance available, indicating the appropriation requirements and the general fund and education fund revenues and reserves available to meet that need: \"General Fund and Education Fund, Comparison of Appropriation Requirements and State Revenues\" for the current year , and next (or recommended budget) year.

From state fiscal year 2008-2009 to 2013-2014, the act awarded over $6 billion to the State of Tennessee. The funds awarded included enhanced medicaid matching funds, grants to Local Education Agencies, increased food stamp benefits, special education grants, and infrastructure grants for highways and bridges. Also, the State of Tennessee applied for and won a $500 million multi- year grant in 2010 to improve educational outcomes as part of the Race to the Top program outlined in ARRA . This funding will be fully programmed by June 30, 2014. Another federal aid development is the passage of the Budget Control Act of 2011, a law designed to provide for an increase in the federal debt limit while reducing long- term budget deficits . Most significantly for the states, the act established spending caps on discretionary spending programs through federal fiscal year 2021 and included automatic procedures to reduce spending over a 10- year period by over $1.2 trillion. The automatic spending cuts, known as sequestration, were triggered on January 2 , 2013 and effective March 1, 2013. As a result, 242 state- administered federal programs in Tennessee were reduced $71.8 million for fiscal year 2013-2014. Fiscal year 2013-2014 also contains increased federal funding to TennCare for implementing certain provisions of the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) . The impacts to the TennCare budget are displayed elsewhere in this volume. Fiscal 2015 Outlook For fiscal year 2014-2015, increased aid from the federal government is recommended largely in the TennCare program. Of the total cost increase from federal sources of $251,436,900, the share directed to the TennCare program is $246,614,800. Implementing provisions of the federal ACA will result in an additional $143.2 million federal funds to the program. These funds are the federal share of costs for the Eligible But Not Enrolled (EBNE) population. Medical inflation and utilization cost increases will require an additional $116.8 million federal funds. A factor reducing the federal aid estimate in both the TennCare and Department of Children's Services budgets is the loss of federal funds due to a decrease in the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) . The FMAP is the rate at which the federal government matches state appropriation expenditures in the programs. The formula measures a state's personal income relative to the nation . The revised FMAP reduced FY15 federal funding by $33.4 million in TennCare and the Department of Children's Services . An increase in state appropriation is recommended to offset this loss of federal funds . Since fiscal year 2009-2010, non- TennCare federal funding has remained flat or lessened from the expiration of non- recurring sources, including American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and Race to the Top funds. TennCare federal funding has grown with rising medical inflation and utilization and implementation of new federal laws.

The $12,911,660,000 of federal funding is a decrease of 2.4% from the 2013-2014 estimate. Of the total federal funding, $6,592,536,200 (51%) is recommended for TennCare expenditures, $2,767,821,800 (22%) for the Department of Human Services, $1,065,843,700 (8%) for the Department of Education, and $2,485,458,300 (19%) for all other state programs. The Bureau of TennCare receives funds from the federal Department of Health and Human Services to administer the state's Medicaid waiver program. The Tennessee Department of Human Services administers multiple federal programs, with the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (formerly known as Food Stamps) being largest . The Tennessee Department of Education also administers multiple large federal programs, receiving funds from the federal Department of Education, for such programs as grants to Local Education Agencies, Special Education, and A-49 Significant Federal Funding Program Actions - 2009 to 2014 In February 2009, Congress passed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) . From state fiscal year 2008-2009 to 2013-2014, the act awarded over $6 billion to the State of Tennessee. The funds awarded included enhanced medicaid matching funds, grants to Local Education Agencies, increased food stamp benefits, special education grants, and infrastructure grants for highways and bridges. Also, the State of Tennessee applied for and won a $500 million multi- year grant in 2010 to improve educational outcomes as part of the Race to the Top program outlined in ARRA . This funding will be fully programmed by June 30, 2014. Another federal aid development is the passage of the Budget Control Act of 2011, a law designed to provide for an increase in the federal debt limit while reducing long- term budget deficits . Most significantly for the states, the act established spending caps on discretionary spending programs through federal fiscal year 2021 and included automatic procedures to reduce spending over a 10- year period by over $1.2 trillion. The automatic spending cuts, known as sequestration, were triggered on January 2 , 2013 and effective March 1, 2013. As a result, 242 state- administered federal programs in Tennessee were reduced $71.8 million for fiscal year 2013-2014. Fiscal year 2013-2014 also contains increased federal funding to TennCare for implementing certain provisions of the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) . The impacts to the TennCare budget are displayed elsewhere in this volume. Fiscal 2015 Outlook For fiscal year 2014-2015, increased aid from the federal government is recommended largely in the TennCare program. Of the total cost increase from federal sources of $251,436,900, the share directed to the TennCare program is $246,614,800. Implementing provisions of the federal ACA will result in an additional $143.2 million federal funds to the program. These funds are the federal share of costs for the Eligible But Not Enrolled (EBNE) population. Medical inflation and utilization cost increases will require an additional $116.8 million federal funds. A factor reducing the federal aid estimate in both the TennCare and Department of Children's Services budgets is the loss of federal funds due to a decrease in the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) . The FMAP is the rate at which the federal government matches state appropriation expenditures in the programs. The formula measures a state's personal income relative to the nation . The revised FMAP reduced FY15 federal funding by $33.4 million in TennCare and the Department of Children's Services . An increase in state appropriation is recommended to offset this loss of federal funds . Since fiscal year 2009-2010, non- TennCare federal funding has remained flat or lessened from the expiration of non- recurring sources, including American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and Race to the Top funds.

Employment should see growth of 1.7 percent and the nation's unemployment rate should drift down to 6.2 percent by the fourth quarter of the year. The state will see marginal improvement in many measures of economy activity in 2014, including gross d omestic product, personal income and the unemployment rate. Inflation -adjusted gross domestic product should see growth of 2.8 percent and nominal personal income will advance 4.2 percent. On a fiscal year basis, personal income should be up 3.3 percent in fiscal year 2014 -2015. The unemployment rate is projected to average 7.5 percent for the year, down from the 8.2 percent rate recorded in 2013. Nonfarm employment will up 1.5 percent, the same rate of growth that took place in 2013. Job growth in manuf acturing will slow to 1.0 percent as output levels inch closer to pre-recession levels of production.

State of Tennessee Tennessee Economic Overview Recommended Budget, Fiscal Year 201 4 - 2015 Tennessee's fiscal environment depends on economic conditions that influence both the expenditure and revenue sides of the state budget. The Center for Business and Economic Research at the University of Tennessee prepared this summary of current economic conditions and expectations for short -term economic growth in Tennessee and the nation. For additional information, see the most recent edition of \"An Economic Report to the Governor of the State of Tennessee.\" Calendar year 2013 was characterized by a number of fiscal shocks tied to the federal government that dampened economic growth. Despite these shocks and other downward pressure points, the economy performed reasonably well for the year. The economy's resilience is testimony to the new -found strength that finally has been established in the aftermath of the Great Recession. Had these same events transpired in 2010, 2011 or 2012, the economy may have slipped back into recession. Expectations for 2014 and 2015 are generally positive and most measu res of economic activity including income and output growth are expected to show improvement. The discussion that follows provides additional background on current economic conditions and the economic outlook for the state and nation to help frame the sta te's fiscal outlook for the upcoming fiscal year. For more information on the economic outlook for the U.S and Tennessee, see An Annual Report to the Governor of the State of Tennessee. Recent Economic Conditions Economic growth in 2013 was respectable in light of all of the downward pressures that the economy confronted. The year began with elimination of the two -percentage point payroll tax holiday and was followed by the sequestration of federal government spending that began in March. In the late sum mer, financial markets overreacted to the possibility of the Federal Reserve winding down its aggressive stimulus program. And throughout the year there was a rancorous debate over the federal budget that culminated with a short- lived federal government sh utdown in October. As all of this transpired, the global economy was suffering from a slowdown that dampened U.S. exports. The national economy nonetheless saw inflation - adjusted gross domestic product rise by 1.9 percent and nonfarm employment grow 1.6 percent for the year. The national unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of 2013 was 7.3 percent, well below the level that prevailed a year prior. Like the nation, economic growth in Tennessee slowed some in 2013, but most measures of economic activity continued to register gains. Nominal personal income was up 2.7 percent for the year compared to 5.3 percent growth in 2012. State gross domestic product outperformed the nation, benefitting from slower but still very strong growth in the manufacturing sector. Nonfarm employment was up 1.5 percent for the year, well below the 2.0 percent growth rate registered in 2012. The state's manufacturing sector continued to see strong job gains with employment advancing 2.2 percent and inflation -adjusted industr ial output growing 3.6 percent. The unemployment rate has been a disappointment. After averaging 7.8 percent in the first quarter of 2013, the unemployment rate jumped to 8.3 percent in the final quarter of the year. Short -Term Economic Outlook The out look for 2014 is relatively bright. The global economy should continue to improve , which will enhance the export position of the U.S. and Tennessee. The federal budget deal that was reached last year and the reduced likelihood of brinkmanship in the budge t process will help instill consumer and investment confidence. Ongoing improvements in the housing sector will help buoy the economy as well. U.S. inflation -adjusted gross domestic product will see growth of 2.7 percent this year, followed by 3.2 percent growth in 2015. Strong growth in consumer spending on durable goods, including light vehicles, will help drive stronger overall economic growth. Some of the best news will come from the nation's housing sector where the value of residential investmen t is expected to jump 14.6 percent in 2014 and 17.3 percent in 2015. U.S. exports will be up 4.6 percent this year compared to growth of only 2.5 percent in 2013. Federal government spending will be a drag on A-51 growth with spending expected to fall 1.1 per cent. Employment should see growth of 1.7 percent and the nation's unemployment rate should drift down to 6.2 percent by the fourth quarter of the year. The state will see marginal improvement in many measures of economy activity in 2014, including gross d omestic product, personal income and the unemployment rate.

A-115 State of Tennessee State Tax Revenues Introduction Recommended Budget, Fiscal Year 20 14-2015 The revenues necessary to finance state government are collected from a variety of sources. The primary source of funding for state expenditures is appropriation from general revenues. General revenues are proceeds from taxes, licenses, fees, fines, f orfeitures, and other imposts laid specifically by law. The revenue estimating process generally starts twelve months before a fiscal year begins. Revenue collections are tracked on a monthly basis, and this information, along with specific long- run forec asts of individual sectors of the economy, is used to form the basis for the next fiscal year's estimated revenue collections. Preliminary estimates are supplied to the Department of Finance and Administration in mid-summer by the Department of Revenue and the University of Tennessee Center for Business and Economic Research. Tax estimates are recalculated in October and November and refined in December and January for inclusion in the Governor's Budget Document. Sales tax estimates are based on estimated retail sales activity, which is provided by the Center for Business and Economic Research. Corporate excise tax estimates are made as late as possible in the year to take advantage of the latest available corporate profit forecasts for the nation and the October state tax returns filed with the Department of Revenue, which provide information useful in projecting quarterly estimated corporate tax payments through the next year. Estimates for selective excise taxes are commonly based on long -run consumption trends for the selectively -taxed items: cigarettes, gasoline, beer, and alcoholic beverages. Long -run trend analysis is also used as a basis for projecting corporate excise and franchise tax collections and Tennessee Valley Authority in lieu of tax payme nts. Motor vehicle fuel (primarily diesel fuel) taxes and motor vehicle registration fees are estimated conservatively, given their sensitivity to business cycles (especially the truck -related components of both taxes). The revenue estimating process in Tennessee incorporates the \"Good Practices in Revenue Estimating\" endorsed by the National Association of State Budget Officers and the Federation of Tax Administrators. This requires using national and state economic forecasts, developing an official reven ue estimate, monitoring and monthly reporting on revenue collections, and revising estimates when appropriate. Tennessee Code Annotated (TCA) 9 -4-5104, 5105, 5106, and 5202 specify the manner in which tax revenue estimates are prepared and transmitted to the General Assembly in the Budget Document. The Commissioner of Finance and Administration prepares revenue estimates based on advice from economists, his own staff, the Department of Revenue, and the State Funding Board. The Funding Board, which is compos ed of the Governor, the Commissioner of Finance and Administration, the Comptroller, the State Treasurer, and the Secretary of State, is assisted in preparing its range of revenue growth estimates by economists from the state's universities, the executive director of the Fiscal Review Committee, and staff of the Department of Finance and Administration, Department of Revenue, and the Treasurer's Office. The Funding Board prepares and recommends a range of revenue growth estimates using the information prov ided by the economists, the executive director of the Fiscal Review Committee, and staff. The Funding Board's review and recommendations concern only the taxes collected by the Department of Revenue. The growth estimates provide a basis for the tax reven ue estimates that are used in preparing the budget. However, recommendation of revenue estimates in the Budget is the responsibility of the Governor A-61 State of Tennessee State Tax Revenues Introduction Recommended Budget, Fiscal Year 20 14-2015 The revenues necessary to finance state government are collected from a variety of sources. The primary source of funding for state expenditures is appropriation from general revenues. General revenues are proceeds from taxes, licenses, fees, fines, f orfeitures, and other imposts laid specifically by law. The revenue estimating process generally starts twelve months before a fiscal year begins. Revenue collections are tracked on a monthly basis, and this information, along with specific long- run forec asts of individual sectors of the economy, is used to form the basis for the next fiscal year's estimated revenue collections. Preliminary estimates are supplied to the Department of Finance and Administration in mid-summer by the Department of Revenue and the University of Tennessee Center for Business and Economic Research. Tax estimates are recalculated in October and November and refined in December and January for inclusion in the Governor's Budget Document. Sales tax estimates are based on estimated retail sales activity, which is provided by the Center for Business and Economic Research. Corporate excise tax estimates are made as late as possible in the year to take advantage of the latest available corporate profit forecasts for the nation and the October state tax returns filed with the Department of Revenue, which provide information useful in projecting quarterly estimated corporate tax payments through the next year. Estimates for selective excise taxes are commonly based on long -run consumption trends for the selectively -taxed items: cigarettes, gasoline, beer, and alcoholic beverages. Long -run trend analysis is also used as a basis for projecting corporate excise and franchise tax collections and Tennessee Valley Authority in lieu of tax payme nts. Motor vehicle fuel (primarily diesel fuel) taxes and motor vehicle registration fees are estimated conservatively, given their sensitivity to business cycles (especially the truck -related components of both taxes). The revenue estimating process in Tennessee incorporates the \"Good Practices in Revenue Estimating\" endorsed by the National Association of State Budget Officers and the Federation of Tax Administrators. This requires using national and state economic forecasts, developing an official reven ue estimate, monitoring and monthly reporting on revenue collections, and revising estimates when appropriate. Tennessee Code Annotated (TCA) 9 -4-5104, 5105, 5106, and 5202 specify the manner in which tax revenue estimates are prepared and transmitted to the General Assembly in the Budget Document. The Commissioner of Finance and Administration prepares revenue estimates based on advice from economists, his own staff, the Department of Revenue, and the State Funding Board. The Funding Board, which is compos ed of the Governor, the Commissioner of Finance and Administration, the Comptroller, the State Treasurer, and the Secretary of State, is assisted in preparing its range of revenue growth estimates by economists from the state's universities, the executive director of the Fiscal Review Committee, and staff of the Department of Finance and Administration, Department of Revenue, and the Treasurer's Office. The Funding Board prepares and recommends a range of revenue growth estimates using the information prov ided by the economists, the executive director of the Fiscal Review Committee, and staff. The Funding Board's review and recommendations concern only the taxes collected by the Department of Revenue. The growth estimates provide a basis for the tax reven ue estimates that are used in preparing the budget. However, recommendation of revenue estimates in the Budget is the responsibility of the Governor A-62 Comparison Statement of State Revenues Estimated July 1, 20 12 - June 30, 20 15 and Commissioner of Finance and Administration. The State Funding Board's most recent letter notifying the Governor and the chairmen of the Senate and House Finance, Ways and Means committees of its revenue growth estimates is included at the end of the State Revenues section in subsection entitled \"State Funding Board, Range of Tax Revenue Estimates.\" This l etter states the economic assumptions affecting the Funding Board's recommendations. A more detailed economic overview is presented in the \"Budget Overview\" section of the Budget Document. The tax revenue estimates recommended in the Budget Document are shown in a following subsection entitled \"Comparison Statement of State Revenues.\" These taxes include not only the taxes collected by the Department of Revenue (the major taxes), but also those collected and deposited to the General Fund by some other line agencies in conjunction with carrying out their programs. In the revenue estimate charts, the latter are shown by collecting agency and are subtotaled as Other S tate R evenue. Following the chart comparing taxes for the three fiscal years are three charts included to show collections by fund. The distribution of taxes among the funds on these charts is as provided by law as it existed last year for 2012 -2013, actual revenue and as it exists currently for 2013-2014, and 2014- 2015 estimates. The funds on the distribution charts, for Budget Document presentation, are General Fund, Education (Trust) Fund, Highway (Transportation) Fund, Debt Service Fund, and Cities and Counties (Local Government) Fund. (For information about the inclusion of certain Special Revenue Fund taxes and fees in the General Fund estimates, see the \"Budget Process\" section. ) Following the four tax revenue estimate charts is a chart detailing the revenues of regulatory boards, with the collections and estimates listed by board. This is a supporting schedule to the \"Comparison Statement of State Revenues\" charts, on which single lines for regulatory board fees appear . In addition to the general revenues detailed in this section, other revenues are collected by departments, institution s, and agencies and are appropriated directly to them. These are called departmental revenues. In the Budget Document, these departmental revenues are estimated by program and are shown as federal revenue, other revenue (or, sometimes, current services and other revenue), and tuition and fees. The term \"other revenue\" includes interdepartmental revenue, current services revenue, non -governmental revenue, and revenue from cities and counties. These various departmental revenues consist of earnings and ch arges for goods and services; student tuition and fees in the higher education system; and donations, contributions, and grants - in-aid from the federal government, political subdivisions, foundations, corporations, and individuals. In a few cases, the other departmental revenues also include reserves from revolving funds or from the unencumbered balance and capital outlay (major maintenance) reserves, in instances in which specific legal authority to carry such funds forward exists. The departmental reven ues are reflected in each department's budget as operating revenue. The next subsection titled \"Tax Expenditures\" presents two tax exemption charts labeled \"Items Not in Sales Tax Base\" and \"Major Tax Exemptions\" as required by law. Subsequently, i nformat ion presented in the subsection entitled \"Revenue Sources and Basis of Apportionment\" outlines the general tax revenues by collecting agency, along with TCA citations on the rate and source of the revenue and the basis of apportionment among funds and agencie s, based on current law.

This section is intended to fulfill that statutory obligation. Under the law, the Budget Document is required to identify all e xemptions from state taxes, to the extent that it is practicable, and estimate the amount of revenue that would have been collected by the state in the ensuing fiscal year if the exemptions were not to exist. No format or reporting period is specified. Tax Exemptions It is not possible to estimate the amount of revenue lost for each of the tax exemptions found in the Tennessee code. For example, since 1947, the list of non- profit institutions that are exempt from the sales tax has grown dramatically. S uch institutions are allowed to buy tangible goods and certain services tax free. Retailers and sellers require proof of exemption and keep records of exempt sales; but tax returns filed with the Department of Revenue do not show detailed statistics on exempt sales by type of exempt entity. Such data is only available in the records of the thousands of individual retailers and vendors who sell directly to the public. Therefore, the tax exemptions listed in the present report consist only of those that c an be estimated with a reasonable degree of accuracy. The fiscal impact of Tennessee's major tax exemptions is presented in tabular form in Tables 1 -A and 1- B. Estimates of revenue loss are provided for FY 2014-2015. Table 1- A presents revenue foregone on services not currently taxed. These services represent activities that were not included in the original tax base. Table 1 -B presents revenue foregone due to specific exemptions in the existing sales tax law. For each item in this table, the exemption is briefly described and the specific authorization of the Tennessee code is cited. It is difficult to estimate the true cost of tax exemptions for two reasons. First, each exemption is considered separately, without regard to how it overlaps with other provisions of the tax code. Summing tax exemptions may result in double -counting in cases where exemptions overlap. Secondly, the estimates of revenue loss provided in the tables do not generally take into account the impact of a change in a particular t ax provision on taxpayer behavior that impacts other taxes (the estimates do not reflect secondary or feedback effects).

Under the law, the Budget Document is required to identify all e xemptions from state taxes, to the extent that it is practicable, and estimate the amount of revenue that would have been collected by the state in the ensuing fiscal year if the exemptions were not to exist. No format or reporting period is specified. Tax Exemptions It is not possible to estimate the amount of revenue lost for each of the tax exemptions found in the Tennessee code. For example, since 1947, the list of non- profit institutions that are exempt from the sales tax has grown dramatically. S uch institutions are allowed to buy tangible goods and certain services tax free. Retailers and sellers require proof of exemption and keep records of exempt sales; but tax returns filed with the Department of Revenue do not show detailed statistics on exempt sales by type of exempt entity. Such data is only available in the records of the thousands of individual retailers and vendors who sell directly to the public. Therefore, the tax exemptions listed in the present report consist only of those that c an be estimated with a reasonable degree of accuracy. The fiscal impact of Tennessee's major tax exemptions is presented in tabular form in Tables 1 -A and 1- B. Estimates of revenue loss are provided for FY 2014-2015. Table 1- A presents revenue foregone on services not currently taxed. These services represent activities that were not included in the original tax base. Table 1 -B presents revenue foregone due to specific exemptions in the existing sales tax law. For each item in this table, the exemption is briefly described and the specific authorization of the Tennessee code is cited. It is difficult to estimate the true cost of tax exemptions for two reasons. First, each exemption is considered separately, without regard to how it overlaps with other provisions of the tax code. Summing tax exemptions may result in double -counting in cases where exemptions overlap. Secondly, the estimates of revenue loss provided in the tables do not generally take into account the impact of a change in a particular t ax provision on taxpayer behavior that impacts other taxes (the estimates do not reflect secondary or feedback effects).

The board was created by the 45th General Assembly with passage of Public Chapter 126, Public Acts of 1887, codified as Title 9, Chapter 9, and Section 101 of the Tennessee Code. By statute, the state's full faith and credit, as well as ten percent of all state tax revenue collected by the Department of Revenue and allocated to the general fund, the debt service fund and the highway fund are pledged for the payment of principal and interest on all state bonds issued after July 2013. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2013, the debt limit calculation produced a maximum annual debt service debt limit of $648,933,400. The annual debt service requirement on the state's outstanding debt, authorized but unissued debt, and proposed bond authorizations in the fiscal year 20 14-2015 budget total $316,164,000, well below the maximum statutory debt limitation . The statutory debt limitation, therefore, provides for a substantial amount of additional debt capacity . Over the years, Tennessee has consistently maintained a relatively low debt burden. This has been accomplished through the use of sound, prudent, and conservative debt management practices adopted by the executive and legislative branches of government, with concurrence of the State Funding Board. Such practices include funding a portion of the state's capital program with surplus cash, cancellation of bond authorizations in lieu of issuing debt, creating and maintaining a \"Rainy Day Fund\" to offset unanticipated revenue shortfalls, and the adoption of state statutes designed to control the issuance of excessive debt. The state continues to maintain a relative low debt burden, and access to the capital markets remains strong. Tennessee's commitment to conservative and pr udent debt management is widelyrecognized by the nation 's leading debt -rating agencies. Current ratings on the state's general obligation long- term debt are: Fitch AAA, Standard and Poor's AA+, and Moody's Investor Service Aa a. Tennessee did not issue any additional general obligation debt in the fi rst six months of this fiscal year. As of June 30, 2013, Tennessee's total general obligation bonded indebtedness was $1,797,895,000, excluding the F acilities Revolving Fund. T his debt was issued entirely for institutional and building construction. In the spring of fiscal 2013, t he first session of the 108 th Ge neral Assembly approved new general obligation bond authorizat ions in the amount of $266,000,000. Of this amount, institutional and building bonds accounted for $185,000,000 and highway bonds $81,000,000. The state's practice of using surplus cash to finance road projects in lieu of issuing debt has been one of the k ey factors in Tennessee's ability to secure and retain very high bond ratings. Consistent with this long -standing policy, the Funding Board cancelled $ 104.6 million in highway bond authorizations, and $13.1 million in building construction bonds and other authorizations . The increase in bond authorization coupled with the Funding Board's action on bond cancellations increased the category of authorized but unissued bonds to $1,848,505,300, which includes $828.8 million in capital construction bonds, $879.4 million in highway fund authorizations, $98.4 million in FRF bonds, and $41.9 million in data processi ng equipment and software bonds. The recommended 2014-2015 Capital Budget is funded from proposed bond authorizations in the amount of $84.1 million, $122.8 m illion from surplus cash , and $41.8 million from federal funds and other sources.

A-157 State of Tennessee Capi tal Budget Recommended Budget, Fi scal Year 201 4-2015 A Capital Project begins when an agency or department identifies a need that can be met through the Capital Budget Process. At a designated point in the year, a gencies and departments submit these project concepts to the Department s of General Services and Finance and Administration . Upon receipt of the capital budget requests, a phased approach of review is undertaken by the Departments of General Services and F inance and Administration . The initial phase focuses on a needs assessment to establish priority and directi on. During this phase, feasibility and/or market studies are performed to determine the viability of the project, project risks, and potential routes of implementation. The goal of the initial phase is to generate a recommend ation regarding the dispositio n of the project. The next phase provides additional planning to de velop better cost estimates. The end result of the above phased approach is the development and prioritization of a formal capital budget request. The various agencies and departments annually submit both their capital maintenance and capital improvement requests in priority order to the Department of Finance and Administration Division of Budget. All capital budget requests are further reviewed on both a technical and financial basis upon receipt by the Department of Finance and Administration. The projects are analyzed for funding requirements and consistency with program goals and are r eviewed within projected avail ability of funds in the budget for the requested fiscal year. If funds are deemed to be insufficient, individual projects may be deferred to be included in future budgets or rejected. The Administration intends for the needs of departmental programs to be the impe tus for all capital outlay, support program , and service requirements. F unding of projects is analyzed on priority of fiscal support for individual existing and new programs t o find the best mix of capital improvements and maintenance to sustain and implement programs. The management of facilities should be flexible enough to adjust to changing programs through renovation of existing assets. Attempts are made to minimize operational costs and future capital expenditures through better design and more flexible layouts, as has been done in the state's new prison s. When a capital project creates the need for additional operational funding, the operating costs are identified d uring the capital budget review and further re viewed in the develo pment of the budget in the year when the new space is expected to be occupied. Improvements to real property funded by public or private funds must be approved by the State Building Commission, comprised of seven ex-officio members: the Governor, the Secretary of State, the Comptroller of the Treasury, the Commissioner of Finance and Administration, the Treasurer, and the Speakers of the Senate and House of Representatives. The State Building Commission, in addition to supervising improvements to real property, oversees leases by state agencies and the demolition of structures located on state pro perty. The capital items presented in this document as recommendations to the General Assembly reflect projects meeting State Building Commis sion requirements and policy guide lines. Capital maintenance projects are defined as major, non- routine repairs and replacements unrelated to new construction and costing $100,000 or more. Maintenance projects costing less than this amount are addressed within the departments' operational budget major maintenance programs. Capital maintenance projects i nclude items that appreciably extend the life of the facility, such as alterations to rectify code deficiencies, modifications for health and safety issues, repairs to improve utility systems, repaving, roof repairs, exterior fencing and lighting, and repair projects that restore a facility to its former condition and do not result in changes in facility use. Funding for these projects is allocated to the individual state enti ties.

Funding for these projects is allocated to the individual state enti ties. A-136 Capital improvement projects are defined as those providing new facilities or materially extending the useful life and improving or changing the function of an existing facility. These projects include facility renovation, new construction, new utility or service systems, land with or without buildings, appurtenances, site improvements or permanent betterments, and initial equipment to fu rnish and operate a new or improved facility that requires the assistance of a design professional or costs $100,000 or more. The 2014-2015 capital outlay budget recom mends $248,745,200 divided between capital improvement projects and capital maintenance requests. The recommendation includes $52.4 million for infrastructure related to the new Hankook Tire Plant, $129.16 million for higher education projects, $4 million to construct a new veterans home, and various upgrades to state facilities . Capital Improvement Projects \u2014 Capital improvement projects recom mended for fi scal year 2014-2015 total $141,961,100, including $78.62 million from state appropriation and $53.1 million from bonds. Other funding sources account for the remainder of the total amount. Projects from dedicated sources of revenue are also recommended for the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Age ncy totaling $2,570,000. Capital Maintenance \u2014 Capital maintenance projects are recom mended at a level o f $106,784,100. A st ate appropriation of $44,180,000 is requested along with a $31 million bond authorization. Other funding sources account for the remainder of the total amount. These projects focus on maintaining current facilities, primarily through repair and renovation of roofing, mechanical, and electrical systems. Funding is also included to bring state facilities in line with federal standards for asbestos and citizens with disabilities. The Tennessee Board of Regents and the University of Tennessee are also funded for modifications to assist in ADA compliance. New Bond Authorizations \u2014 The Capital Budg et includes a proposed bond authorization of $84.1 million. This includes $28.4 million for higher education projects, $ 52.4 million for the new Hankook Tire Plant, and $3.3 million to renovate and update facilities . Total capital maintenance, capital improvements, and Facilities Revolving Fund requests will require bond authorizations totaling $ 84.1 million. The following chart compares the bond authorizations recommended with those approved by the General Assembly during the past several years. Facilities Revolving Fund \u2014 Capital funding in the am ount of $23,820,000 is recommended for capital m ainte nance and capital i mprovement projects. The total recommended amount is funded with departmental funds. These projects are listed in the Facilities Revolving Fund section, which follows the Capital Budget section of this document. Oper ating Costs \u2014 This section includes estimates of the first year operating costs resulting from proposed new construction. Differences can be the result of efficiencies from better d esigns and energy systems or program requirements. Renovation pr ojects that do not have an impact on operating efficiencies are considered to be cost neutral. Only those projects that will have increased operating costs from the current budget are included in the schedule.

Through Race to the Top, the U.S. Department of Education has asked states to advance reforms around four specific areas: adopt standards and assessments th at prepare students to succeed in college and the workplace and to compete in the global economy; build data systems that measure student growth and success and inform teachers and principals about how they can improve instruction; recruit, develop, reward, and retain effective t eachers and principals, especially where they are needed most; and turn around lowest-achieving schools. Tennessee was awarded $500 million over four years to implement the innovative activities put forward in the grant application. Critical to Tennessee's success was the passage by the Tennessee General Assembly of First Extraordinar y Session Public Chapter 2, the \"First to the Top Act of 2010.\" This legislation significantly changed the requirements for teacher evaluations, allows school systems to develop alternative salary schedules, and created the Achievement School District to allow state takeover of chronically failing schools in Tennessee.

Through Race to the Top, the U.S. Department of Education has asked states to advance reforms around four specific areas: adopt standards and assessments th at prepare students to succeed in college and the workplace and to compete in the global economy; build data systems that measure student growth and success and inform teachers and principals about how they can improve instruction; recruit, develop, reward, and retain effective t eachers and principals, especially where they are needed most; and turn around lowest-achieving schools. Tennessee was awarded $500 million over four years to implement the innovative activities put forward in the grant application. Critical to Tennessee's success was the passage by the Tennessee General Assembly of First Extraordinar y Session Public Chapter 2, the \"First to the Top Act of 2010.\" This legislation significantly changed the requirements for teacher evaluations, allows school systems to develop alternative salary schedules, and created the Achievement School District to allow state takeover of chronically failing schools in Tennessee.

The executive director of the Tennessee Higher Education Commission serves as the executive director of TSAC. Currently, TSAC's duties include guaranteeing student loans; administering the Academic Scholars program and, for financially needy Tennesseans, the Tennessee Student Assistance Awards program; administering loan and scholarship programs encouraging students to enter the teaching, nursing, and medical professions; executing the federal program designed to prevent potential defaults on student loans; arranging for or serving as the lender of last resort; and marketing and administering the Tennessee Education Lottery Scholarship program.

The workload of the court consists of cases appealed from lower courts. Supreme Court decisions act to resolve controversies arising out of Tennessee law and to establish guidelines for the lower courts to use in future decisions. The intermediate appellate courts are the Court of Appeals and the Court of Criminal Appeals. The Court of Appeals hears appeals only in ci vil cases from the lower courts.

THDA was created in response to a need for housing initiatives in rural areas, but it also performs activities in the major urban centers. The agency is authorized to sell tax- exempt revenue notes and bonds to provide funds for making below-market interest rate mortgage loans. Through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's Section 8 program, THDA provides rental subsidies to assist renters in need and administers project-b ased contracts. THDA also administers two federally funded grant programs, the HOME program and the Neighborhood Stabilization program. The HOME program assists local housing providers in implementing affordable housing plans. The Neighborhood Stabilization program provides grants to non-profit organizations and local governments that buy foreclosed homes, rehabilitate, and rent or resell the homes to low- to middle-income families in order to help stabilize the housing market. The agency received proceeds from the National Mortgage Settlement fund which are being utilized to support activities aimed to prevent foreclosures. More recently, THDA has assumed administration of two federal programs from the Department of Human Services. The Weatheri zation Assistance Program (WAP) enables low- income families to permanently reduce their energy bills by making their homes more energy efficient. The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) helps keep families safe and healthy through initiatives that assist families with energy costs. Activities of THDA include the rehabilitation and construction of rental and homeowner housing. The low income housing tax credit program, administered by THDA, supports acquisition, rehabilitation, and new construction of rental units for low-income tenants. THDA has a governing board composed of state officials and gubernatorial and legislative appointees who are active and knowledgeable in their respective industries.

Planning and Estimation Immediately after a new fiscal year begins each July, the staff of the Division of Budget begins making plans for the budget that will be considered by the General Assembly for the subsequent fiscal year. These plans inc lude designing and updating the forms and instructions used by departments and agencies in presenting their operational and capital budget requests to the Division of Budget. These electronic forms and instructions are distributed to the agencies in Augu st. The deadline for completion and transmission of the budget requests is the first of October. During this preparation period, the staff of the Division of Budget meets as needed with agencies' fiscal , capital , and program personnel to answer questions and provide assistance in developing their budget requests. In addition to projecting expenditure levels, estimates of the major revenue sources, such as the sales, franchise, excise and gasoline taxes, are prepared for both the current and next fiscal years. The revenue estimates are prepared by the Commissioner of Finance and Administration after receiving advice from the State Funding Board, as required by TCA section 9 -4- 5202. All revenue estimates, including estimates for licenses and fees, are part of the budget review by the Commissioner of Finance and Administration, the Governor, and their staffs. Preparation of the Budget Chapter 33 of the Public Acts of 1937 granted the Governor the authority and duty to develop and submit to the General Assembly a recommended budget. The law directs the Commissioner of Finance and Administration to prepare the budget in accordance with the Governor's directives. B-328 B-328The Budget Process After the receipt of agency operational and capital budget requests, analysts with the Division of Budget begin the process of balancing expenditures against estimated revenues. Within this constraint, funds must be provided for Administration initiatives of high priority, activities mandated by state or federal statute, and the day -to-day operat ion of state government. Instructions for the agency operational budget requests include the submission of two levels of requests: (a) a base request, which accommodates the continuation of current services, and (b) a cost increase r e- quest, which includes funds to implement mandated requirements, compensate for rev- enue reductions, initiate new programs, or enhance the base level due to increased costs of providing current services. Capital Budget requests are submitted to the Division of Budget along with agency operating budget requests, where they are reviewed in conjunction with the Real Estate Asset Management office. Based on these reviews and available funding, recommen- dations are made to the Commissioner of Finance and Administration and t he Gove r- nor for consideration in the Budget. Following analysis of the requests by the Division of Budget, detailed recom - mendations are made to the Commissioner of Finance and Administration. Meetings are convened with commissioners and directors of the departments and agencies by the Commissioner of Finance and Admin- istration. A consensus is sought with the agencies as to the appropriate funding level for the upcoming year. After these meetings are completed, the Budget Division staff makes any revisio ns that have been agreed upon and presents the estimates to the Commissioner of Finance and Administration for his and the Governor's consideration. The Governor and the commissioner review the recommendations resulting from these hearings and consider necessary alterations to fit within the scope of the Administration's initiatives and estimated revenues. The Governor may choose to conduct meetings or budget hearings with agency heads and may direct them to submit plans for further adjustments to their budgets. After gubernatorial decisions have been finalized, the staff of the Division of Budget prepares the Budget Document for printing. Meanwhile, work begins on the Governor's Budget Message. The Budget must be presented to the General Assembly prior to February 1, or prior to March 1 when a newly elected Governor takes office, unless the General Assembly by joint resolution allows submission on a later date. At the time the Budget Document and Budget Message are presented, the appropriation process is initiated. The Appropriations Bill, prepared by the Department of Finance and Administration, is introduced and referred to the Finance, Ways and Means committees of both houses of the Legislature. The various standing committees of the houses may review those parts of the Appropriations B ill that fall within their purviews. The departments often are invited to testify before these committees on issues relating to their budgets. After these committees report their reviews, the Finance, Ways and Means committees begin hearings on the budget in its entirety. Again, the departments may testify, and the Commissioner of Finance and Administration is invited to discuss the budget recommendations. Considerations made by the committees include the fiscal impacts caused by other legislation introduced by the members of both houses, recommendations of other legislative committees, and Appropriations Bill amendments filed by members of the Legislature. The Finance, Ways and Means committees of each house repor t out the Appropriations Bill with any amendments they recommend. The Appropriations Bill then is sent to Calendar committees of each house to be scheduled for floor action. The Senate and House of Representatives must pass the same Appropriations Bill in the same form for it to be enacted into law. Approval of the General Appropriations Bill usually The Budget Process occurs during the last week of the legislative session. In signing the bill into law, the Governor may line -item veto or reduce specific appropriations. Or, he could veto the entire bill; but this rarely would be done. Any veto may be over -ridden by a majority of the elected members, each house acting separately. Tennessee has a tradition of enacting a single General Appropriations Act each year. Budget Exe cution When passage of the Appropriations Bill is complete and is signed or enacted into law, the execution of the act begins. Two important concepts are involved: preparation of work programs and development of allotment controls. Invariably, there are changes to the Budget Document presented by the Governor to the General Assembly. These changes are made by amending the Appropriations Act during the adoption process. Analysts of the Division of Budget and fiscal personnel in the departments and agencies have the responsibility of reconciling the approved Appropriations Act with the Budget Document. This may involve increases or decreases to the agency allotments. The Division of Budget establishes an annual allotment for each agency and division usi ng the reconciled Appropriations Act. This annual allotment, called the official work program, is provided to the Division of Accounts as a means of spending control. The agencies and divisions spend against these allotments during the fiscal year. Budge t execution is a process that continues throughout the fiscal year. In addition to the daily review of numerous operational and personnel transaction requests, the budget analysts must ensure that the legislative intent of the Appropriations Act is being followed by the various departments and agencies. Further legislative review and control is maintained through the Fiscal Review Committee and the Finance, Ways and Means committees. In addition to the review of agency activities by these bodies, the Finance, Ways and Means committees must be informed of any new or expanded programs resulting from unanticipated departmental revenues. These revenues usually are new federal grants, but also may be other departmental revenues. When notice of unexpected reven ue is received by an agency, the Commissioner of Finance and Administration, if he wants to approve the program expansion, may submit an expansion report to the chairmen of the finance committees for acknowledgement. Upon the chairmen's acknowledgement of the expansion report, the Commissioner of Finance and Administration may allot the additional departmental revenue to implement the proposed or expanded program. Agencies may not expand programs or implement new programs on their own authority. This expansion procedure is not used to increase allotments funded from state tax revenue sources. No appropriations from state tax sources may be increased except pursuant to appropriations made by law. A transfer of appropriations between allotments for purposes other than those for which they were appropriated may not occur without the approval of the Commissioner of Finance and Administration and a committee comprised of the Speakers of the House and the Senate and the Comptroller of the Treasury. Throughout the fiscal year, the Budget Division staff reviews the status of the various allotments and advises the Commissioner of Finance and Admin - istration of any problems. At the end of the fiscal year, the Division of Budget has the responsibility of executing rev isions to the annual allotments as a function of the accounts closing process. Audit and Review Post-audit and review also are functions that continue throughout the fiscal year. Post-audit is a responsibility of the Comptroller of the Treasury, an offic ial B-329 B-329 The Budget Process After the receipt of agency operational and capital budget requests, analysts with the Division of Budget begin the process of balancing expenditures against estimated revenues.

Audit and Review Post-audit and review also are functions that continue throughout the fiscal year. Post-audit is a responsibility of the Comptroller of the Treasury, an offic ial B-330 B-330The Budget Process elected by the General Assembly. The Division of State Audit, within the Comptroller's Office, has the duty of conducting, supervising, and monitoring the audits of all state departments and agencies. Intermediate care facilities receiving Medicaid funds also are within the purview of this division, and state grants to other entities also are subject to aud it. In addition, program audits are performed to determine whether agencies are functioning efficiently. The General Assembly also participates in a continuing review throughout the fiscal year. The Fiscal Review Committee, a bipartisan committee comprised of members from both houses, meets regularly when the General Assembly is not in session. Following a set agenda, members of this committee rev iew audit reports and departmental personnel respond to inquiries about activities and programs under the department's jurisdiction. Governmental Accountability: Strategic Planning and Performance Measures The Governmental Accountability Act of 2013 amended the Governmental Accountability Act of 2002, which required strategic planning, performance- based budgeting, and performance audits, to require strategic planning, performance measures, and performance aud its. By August 15 each year, executive branch agencies submit strategic plans to the Commissioner of Finance and Administration who may require modifications. The Commissioner must consolidate approved plans and submit them to the Governor and General Assembly by September 30 each year . For 2013, the Commissioner of Finance and Administration, as allowed by law , exempted the Higher Education Commission and non -cabinet agencies from submitting plans to Finance and Administration, but encouraged the commission and non- cabinet agencies to continue the planning process. The judicial branch, Comptroller of the Treasury, State Treasurer, Secretary of State, Attorney General and Reporter, and legislative branch are not subject to strategic plan review by the Commissioner of Finance and Administration. They must submit plans separately to the General Assembly and Governor by September 30. Under the Accountability Act, instructions for developing strategic plans and performance measures are issued to executive branch agencies by the Commissioner of Finance and Administration, who under other law , also issues budget instructions to all agencies. The s trategic plans must include performance measures and standards, which must be included in the recommended Budget Document. The Governmental Accountability Act requires the Commissioner of Finance and Administration to annually evaluate strategic plans and performance measures. Also under the Governmental Accountability Act, as well as und er other law, each state agency is subject to performance review by the Comptroller of the Treasury. The Governmental Accountability Act s of 2013 and 2002 continue the Tennessee tradition of strong executive management of the line agencies, begun with the Governmental Reorganization Act of 1923, and strong executive budget development and budget execution responsibility, begun with the budget law of 1937. The General Assembly has the prerogative to alter executive recommendations through the Appropriations Act and to alter policy and exert oversight through the legislative and performance review processes. State of Tennessee Basis of Budgeting and Accounting Budgeting Basis The annual budget of the State of Tennessee is prepared on the modif ied accrual basis of accounting - the method under which revenues are recognized when they become available and measurable, and expenditures are recognized when the liability is incurred. Most appropriations generally lapse at the end of each fiscal year. Appropriations for contractual obligations in the Highway Fund do not lapse at year end, but are carried forward for subsequent year expenditures . In addition, it is the state's budgetary practice to appropriate matching dollars for jointly funded projects in the year of federal apportionment. Most revenue collection estimates are presented on a mo dified accrual basis, consistent with the basis of accounting explained below. The law requires the Governor to present his proposed budget to the General Assembly annually. The General Assembly enacts the budget through passage of a general appropriations act. This act appropriates funds at the program level. Before signing the Appropriations Act, the Governor may veto or reduce any specific appropriation, subject to legislative override. Once passed and signed, the budget, in the form of the Appropria tions Act, becomes the state's financial plan for the coming year. Budgetary control is maintained at the program level by the individual departments and agencies, acting in conjunction with the Department of Finance and Administration. The latter has a Division of Budget and a Division of Accounts to execute budgetary controls. The Budget Document details the separation between payroll and operational funds by program. Any movement of funds between the payroll and operational funds requires approval an d a revision to the budget by the Division of Budget on behalf of the Commissioner of Finance and Administration and the Governor. Other budget revisions during the year, reflecting program changes or intradepartmental transfers of an administrative natur e, require certain executive and legislative branch approval, pursuant to law. This is discussed in detail in the \"Budget Process\" subsection. With proper legal authority, the Division of Budget, acting on behalf of the Governor and Commissioner of Finance and Administration, may execute allotment (or budget) revisions. The line agencies may not make these revisions themselves. In Tennessee, as in other states, appropriation of funds is a legislative power, not an executive power. No expenditures may b e made, and no allotments increased, except pursuant to appropriations made by law. For Budget Document purposes, all funds are classified as General Fund except for the Department of Transportat ion (Transportation, or Highway Fund), Capital Outlay (Capita l Projects Fund), Facilities Revolving Fund, Debt Service (or Sinking) Fund, and Cities and Counties - State -Shared Taxes (Local Government Fund). The Education Trust Fund, including the Lottery for Education Account, for which state tax revenues are esti mated separately, is included in the General Fund in the presentation of the Budget Overview, although a separate fund balance statement for this fund is included in the \"Financial Statements\" section of the Budget Document. The presentation of all the ope rating budgets within the General Fund in the Budget Document, except for Transportation, is done for ease of budget presentation and understanding. In the Budget, revenue estimates for Special Revenue, Internal Service, and Enterprise Fund programs, funded by dedicated revenues, are included in the state tax revenue and departmental revenue estimates in the General Fund, as are those programs' expenditures. Special Revenue Fund programs reflected in the General Fund in the Budget Document are: Wildlif e Resources Agency Boating Safety Wetlands Acquisition Fund Wetlands Compensation Fund Tennessee Regulatory Authority Education Fund B-331 B-331 The Budget Process elected by the General Assembly.

Enterprise Fund programs reflected in the General Fund in the Budget Document are: Tennessee Housing Development Agency Grain Indemnity Fund Client Protection Fund. In the \"Budget Overview,\" Education Trust Fund programs are presented in the General Fund, although the tax apportionments for the Education Fund are separately estimated. This, again, is done for ease of presentation and understanding of the budget. It also is done because the taxes earmarked and apportioned to the Education Fund are less than the Education appropriations, requiring General Fund tax support for Education programs. The programs in the Education Trust Fund are: (1) Department of Education (K -12), including general -source programs and the dedicated -source After -School Programs Special Account, funded by 100% of unclaimed lottery prizes; (2) Higher Education, including state appropriations for the University of Tennessee, the State University and Community College System (Board of Regents), the Foreign Language Institute, and the dedicated- source appropriation in the Lottery for Education Account; and (3) all funding sources for programs of the Higher Education Commission and the Student Assistance Corporation. In the Budget Document, certain institutional revenues for the two university systems are estimated. These include unrestricted educational and general revenues (E&G), and auxiliary enterprise funds. Examples of unrestricted E&G funds are student tuition and fees; unrestricted state, federal, local, and private gifts, grants, and contracts; local appropriations; and sales and services related to academic programs. Restricted funds are not reflected in the Budget Document. Although presenting the operating budgets in this consolidated fa shion makes the budget easier to understand, the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) does present the Sp ecial Revenue and other funds separate ly from the General Fund. The Division of Accounts provides that document to the General Assembly and th e public. Basis of Budgeting and Accounting Accounting Basis (From Division of Accounts, Comprehensive Annual Financial Report) The financial statements of the State of Tennessee are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, as prescribed by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB). These principles require that the financial statements present the primary government and its component units, or the entities for which the government is considered to be financially accountable. Component units are discretely presented in a separate column in the government -wide financial statements to emphasize legal separation from the primary government. In t he government -wide financial statements, the financial activities of the state are reported as governmental or business -type activities. The government -wide financial statements are reported using the accrual basis of accounting. Revenues are recorded when earned and expenses are recorded when a liability is incurred, regardless of the timing of related cash flows. In the fund financial statements, the state's major governmental funds include: General Fund - used to account for all financial transactions not required to be accounted for in other funds; Education Fund - used to account for revenues and expenditures associated with programs involving the Department s of Education and Higher Education. Funding is provided primarily from the dedicated sales and services taxes and federal monies received from the U.S. Department of Education. Net education lottery proceeds and 100% of unclaimed lottery prizes fund higher education scholarships and a fter-school programs; Highway Fund - used to account for revenues and expenditures associated with the Department of Transportation. Funding is provided from dedicated highway user taxes and funds received from the various federal transportation agen cies; and, Capit al Projects Fund - used to account for the acquisition or construction of all major governmental capital facilities. The state's non- major governmental funds , reported in a single column, include: Special Revenue Fund - used to account for specific reven ues earmarked to finance particular or restricted programs and activities; Debt Service Fund - used to account for the payment of principal and interest on general long -term debt; and, Permanent Funds - used to account for legally restricted funds where only earnings, not principal, can be spent. All of the gover nmental funds are reported using the current financial resources measurement focus and the modified accrual basis of accounting. Under this basis, revenues are recognized when they become measurable and available. Expenditures generally are recorded when a liability is incurred, as under accrual accounting. However, debt service expenditures, as well as expenditur es related to compensated absences and claims and judgments, are typically recorded only when payment is due. Principal revenue sources considered susceptible to accrual include taxes, federal funds, local funds and investment income. Taxes and similarly measurable fees and fines, are generally considered to be available if collected within 60 days after fiscal year -end. Grants and similar items are recognized as revenue when all eligibility requirements impose d by the provider have been met, and the amou nt is received during the current period or within six months after fiscal year-end. The state uses this same six month availability period for most other measurable revenues. However , tobacco and similar litigation settlement proceeds are generally considered available if collection is expected within 12 months after fiscal year -end. Licenses, permits, and other similar miscellaneous revenue items are considered measurable and available only when cash is received by the state.

Funding is provided primarily from the dedicated sales and services taxes and federal monies received from the U.S. Department of Education. Net education lottery proceeds and 100% of unclaimed lottery prizes fund higher education scholarships and a fter-school programs; Highway Fund - used to account for revenues and expenditures associated with the Department of Transportation. Funding is provided from dedicated highway user taxes and funds received from the various federal transportation agen cies; and, Capit al Projects Fund - used to account for the acquisition or construction of all major governmental capital facilities. The state's non- major governmental funds , reported in a single column, include: Special Revenue Fund - used to account for specific reven ues earmarked to finance particular or restricted programs and activities; Debt Service Fund - used to account for the payment of principal and interest on general long -term debt; and, Permanent Funds - used to account for legally restricted funds where only earnings, not principal, can be spent. All of the gover nmental funds are reported using the current financial resources measurement focus and the modified accrual basis of accounting. Under this basis, revenues are recognized when they become measurable and available. Expenditures generally are recorded when a liability is incurred, as under accrual accounting. However, debt service expenditures, as well as expenditur es related to compensated absences and claims and judgments, are typically recorded only when payment is due. Principal revenue sources considered susceptible to accrual include taxes, federal funds, local funds and investment income. Taxes and similarly measurable fees and fines, are generally considered to be available if collected within 60 days after fiscal year -end. Grants and similar items are recognized as revenue when all eligibility requirements impose d by the provider have been met, and the amou nt is received during the current period or within six months after fiscal year-end. The state uses this same six month availability period for most other measurable revenues. However , tobacco and similar litigation settlement proceeds are generally considered available if collection is expected within 12 months after fiscal year -end. Licenses, permits, and other similar miscellaneous revenue items are considered measurable and available only when cash is received by the state.
