The Awake in the Wild Teacher Training is for people who care deeply about the earth, who have a strong Dharma / meditation practice and who take that contemplative presence into the outdoors. Equally important, it is for those who feel called to take people deep into nature with a spirit of reverence and contemplation. The 2023-2024 training program has just started in Europe. The 2024-2025 training program will be held in North America. A Field Guide to Nature Meditation: Available in Print, Audio & Kindle \"From the simplest feeling of a gentle breeze to the great mysteries of life and death, Mark Coleman guides us into an ever-deepening appreciation and understanding of the world around us. A jewel of a book, and highly recommended.\" \u2014Joseph Goldstein, author of Mindfulness: A Practical Guide to Awakening "}
