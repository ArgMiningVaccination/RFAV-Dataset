The human body produces antibodies that attack acetylcholine receptors, interrupting the communication between nerve and muscle, causing muscular weakness. Homoeopathy has great potential for treatment of myasthenia gravis with improving muscular weakness and enhances the quality of gravis. autoimmune disorder where antibodies against the nicotinic [acetylcholine] receptors on the post-synaptic membrane of the neuromuscular junction inhibit neuromuscular transmission causing muscular weakness. Myasthenia gravis is the commonest neuromuscular disorder with a prevalence of 14.2 cases per million in the US and 20 to 70 cases per million in the UK.1(i) Causes Neuromuscular transmission depends on the opening of acetylcholine-gated ion channels in muscles by the nerve-evoked, quantal release of neurotransmitter from the nerve terminal. The resulting endplate potential triggers the muscle action potential, leading to muscles contraction. The primary abnormality in the myasthenia gravis is loss of acetylcholine receptors, which caused by heterogeneous IgG antibodies that can be detected in the serum.2(i) Classification According to causes [myasthenia to transplacental transfer of maternal antiacetylcholine receptor antibodies 3 Drug induced myasthenia gravis- caused due to some drugs 4 Congenital myasthenia gravis- genetic abnormality in acetylcholine receptors Triggering factors- Fatigue, Illness, Stress, Extreme heat, Pregnancy, Some medications and some antibiotics. Signs & symptoms A disease characterized by progressive fatigue and generalized weakness of the skeletal muscles, especially those of the face, neck, arms, and legs, caused by impaired transmission of nerve impulses following an autoimmune attack on acetylcholine receptors. Ocular / Eye muscles: In more than half the people who develop myasthenia gravis (MG), their first signs and symptoms involve eye problems, such as: Drooping of one or both eyelids (ptosis), Double vision (diplopia), which may be horizontal or vertical, Blurred vision, which may come and go. Face and throat muscles: In about 15 percent of people with myasthenia gravis, the first symptoms involve face and throat muscles, which can cause difficulties with: Speaking. speech may be very soft or sound nasal, depending upon which muscles have been affected. Swallowing may choke very easily, which makes it difficult to eat, drink or take pills. In some cases, liquids trying to swallow may come out of nose. The muscles used for chewing may wear out halfway through a meal, particularly if eating something hard to chew, such as steak. Facial expressions. Facial expressions are affected. Arm and leg muscles: Myasthenia gravis (MG) can cause weakness in arms and legs, but this usually happens in conjunction with muscle weakness in other parts of body \u2014 such as eyes, face or throat. The disorder usually affects arms more often than legs.2(iii) Complications Myasthenic crisis is a medical emergency that develops when muscles that control breathing become severely weakened. This condition may lead to acute respiratory failure and patients often require a respirator to assist breathing during the crisis. Other complications that may develop include choking, food aspiration, and pneumonia. Diagnosis It is not diagnosed easily. Since weakness can happen in any other disease, mild myasthenia gravis is often not diagnosed. Suspected patients can diagnose with the help of Neostigmine test, Icepack test, Electrophysiological test, Serological test, Radiological test.1(ii) Homoeopathic approach Homoeopathy with its holistic approach proves to be one of the most valuable systems of medicine while dealing with the cases of Myasthenia gravis (MG). The innermost core of philosophy allows treating the patients on the basis of individualisation. The totality includes subjective and objective understanding about the disease state where the underlying cause and the individual's susceptibility are being addresses.3 Myasthenia gravis is a progressively deteriorating condition, calling for some measures to control the disease process. Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disorder guided by genetic tendencies and other general factors. In other words, it is a constitutional disorder, where the whole constitution needs to be addressed. Homoeopathic treatment being constitutional in nature treats the disease at a deeper level through the process of full individualizing examination and case analysis.

With the help of homeopathic medicines, the faulty immune system can be made to work properly, not producing antibodies that are against the body. Homoeopathy with its holistic approach proves to be one of the most valuable systems of medicine while treating the cases of Myasthenia gravis. Homoeopathy has inordinate potential for dealing Myasthenia gravis with improving muscular weakness and boosts the quality of patient's life.
