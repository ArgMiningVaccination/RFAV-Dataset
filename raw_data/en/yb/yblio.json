In month 9, plan to see your provider each week until your baby arrives. You and your provider will decide the timing and number of visits based on your health needs. These visits are needed to learn how the baby is growing. You will also be able to talk with your provider about your feelings, any physical changes, and medical tests you are offered. At each visit, your weight, blood pressure, the growth and position of your baby, and your baby's heart rate will be checked. Your provider will also begin checking your cervix for softening, thinning (effacement) or opening (dilation). Your care team will talk with you about what else needs to be done to make sure we know your wishes for labor and delivery.4 Third Trimester Vaccinations You can receive the vaccines from your primary care provider, a walk-in clinic, or a local pharmacy. Tdap Vaccine This vaccine prevents the spread of pertussis, more commonly known as whooping cough, to your baby. Tdap vaccination is recommended between 27 and 36 weeks of pregnancy and for all those who will be spending time with your baby, including grandparents and daycare providers who have not received a booster in 10 years. Gestational Diabetes Toward the end of the second trimester, or beginning of the third trimester, you will have a glucose tolerance test. This test will see if you have developed gestational diabetes. This condition can affect your health and the health of the baby. This form of diabetes often goes away after pregnancy, but it is also important to care for yourself and your baby during pregnancy. Some moms can manage gestational diabetes with diet and exercise, some will need oral medicines, and some will need to use insulin. Getting Ready for the Test Eat and drink normally but avoid high sugar foods. How is the test done? At your appointment, you will be given a special sweet flavored drink that is approved by the lab. After an hour, we will check your blood sugar. If the results are high, you may need a second test. Getting Ready for the Second Test Do not eat or drink anything but water for 8 to 12 hours before your test. How is the second test done? Your blood sugar will be checked 4 times. 1. Your blood sugar will be checked when you arrive at the clinic after not eating for 8-12 hours. Then you will drink the same sweet flavored drink as before. 2. Blood sugar test after 1 hour 3. Blood sugar test after 2 hours 4. Blood sugar test after 3 hours You will need to be at the clinic for up to four hours. You cannot eat anything until after the final blood sugar test. You may want to bring a snack for when the test is complete. 45 Third Trimester Fetal Movement Counts It is normal to worry about your baby's health. One way you can know your baby is doing well is to record the baby's movements one time each day. This is called a kick count. When to Start Kick Counts Start at 28 weeks for an average pregnancy Start earlier as directed by your provider for high-risk pregnancy How to Do a KickCount Here are tips for counting kicks: Choose a time when the baby is active, such as after a meal Sit comfortably or lie on your side The first time the baby moves, write down the time Count each movement until the baby has moved 10 times. This can take from 20 minutes to 2 hours. The movements can be kicks, twists, turns, swishes, or rolls Try to do it at the same time each day Get to know what is normal for your baby Helpful Hints Babies are usually most active between 9 p.m. and 1 a.m. Babies sleep an average of 20 to 40 minutes at a time Lay down in a quiet, undisturbed area Every woman and baby is different when it comes to feeling movement Hiccups do not count as movements Call your provider or go to the hospital right away if you notice any of the following: Your baby moves fewer than 10 times in 2 hours while you are doing kick counts Your baby moves much less often than on the days before You have not felt your baby move all day 56 Third TrimesterPreterm Labor Preterm labor starts when you go into labor and are still 3 weeks or more away from your due date. An early delivery can cause your baby to have problems with breathing, eating, and keeping normal body temperature. Knowing the signs of preterm labor can help you know when to get help and avoid a possibly serious situation. Early Warning Signs of Preterm Labor (Before 37 Weeks) Contractions (the belly tightens like a fist) every 10 minutes or more often Change in vaginal discharge Large increase in the amount of discharge Leaking fluid Bleeding Pelvic pressure - the feeling that the baby is pushing down Low, dull backache Cramps that feel like a menstrual period Belly cramps with or without diarrhea If you have any of these symptoms, call your health care provider to decide if you may be having preterm labor. Pregnancy Warning Signs Headache that does not go away Swelling in your face, eyes, or hands Sudden weight gain over 1 to 2 days Pain or burning when you urinate Not urinating very much at a time Vomiting or diarrhea lasting 24 hours or more Vision changes - such as blurry vision, seeing spots or flashing lights, dimming vision, or sensitive to light Pain in your belly below your ribs Vaginal bleeding Less or no fetal movement7 Third Trimester Signs of Labor When it is time for baby to arrive, they will let you know. True labor contractions are regular, get stronger, last longer, and get closer together. False labor contractions will remain irregular. Here are some signs that it is time for baby to be born. Counting Contractions You may have contractions during the last few months of pregnancy. Read the Understanding Birth book for more information. An easy way to remember when it is time to go to the hospital is 5-1-1. Contracts are: 5 minutes apart Last 1 minute each Going on for 1 hour If you live more than a one hour drive from the hospital or you have any complications, talk with your care team about when to come to the hospital. Mucous Plug When you are pregnant, the center of your cervix is filled with thick mucous called a mucous plug. Losing your mucous plug means that your body is preparing for labor in the next days or weeks. Most women do not notice when the mucus plug passes. If you do notice it, do not worry. You do not need to call the hospital or your provider. Losing the mucus plug is a normal process. Recognizing True Labor Contractions are your uterine muscles tightening. If you place your hand over your abdomen you can feel your uterus get hard. That is a contraction. Your contractions may start out feeling like menstrual cramps or gas pains, but they may be more painful. Take a warm bath or rest. If contractions continue, you may be in labor. If you are still unsure, change positions or take a walk. If contractions continue and become stronger, labor has probably begun. 78 Third TrimesterWhen to Come to the Hospital If your due date is more than 4 weeks away and you are having what you think is true labor, call the hospital. When your contractions are every 5 minutes or if you are too uncomfortable to stay home. When your water breaks, even if no contractions are present. This could be a gush or just a small trickle of fluid. If you have constant, severe pain. If you have bright red vaginal bleeding. Tell Your Provider Let your provider know if you have any of the following: Headache Dizziness Changes in vision Severe pain in the abdomen Sudden swelling in hands, feet, or face Sudden weight gain Chills or fever Problems urinating or a burning sensation when you urinate Your baby moves less Go to the Resources page to find the phone number for the hospital near you. Car Seat To-Do List Find a car seat. Make sure the car seat is new or from someone you trust. If used, make sure the car seat has not been involved in an accident, not recalled, and not expired. Read the instruction manual to learn how to install your seat. Install your car seat before going to the hospital. Get your seat checked at Sanford's free car seat checks. To find a car seat inspection resource in your community, visit our Parenting Resources page.9 Third TrimesterTime to Pack Your Bags Packing in advance can help you feel ready for the arrival of your baby whenever they decide to come. We recommend having your bags packed by your eighth month. Some items are provided.

Labor should only be induced for medical reasons\u2014not for convenience or scheduling concerns. Until then, here are the top reasons to go at least 39 weeks of pregnancy. 1. There are fewer complications and risks for both you and baby through a vaginal birth. 2. Recover faster - A vaginal birth has a faster recovery time than a cesarean birth, which is a major abdominal surgery. 3. Birth a brainier baby - At 35 weeks your baby's brain is only two-thirds the size it will be at full term. 4. Boost breastfeeding - Term babies are better at sucking and swallowing than babies born earlier. 5. Reduce your baby's risk - Babies born early have a higher risk of jaundice, low blood sugar and infection. 6. Maximize those little lungs - Babies born just 2 or more weeks early can have far more problems breathing. Inducing Labor Sometimes labor needs a little help to get started. Your provider may recommend inducing labor for several reasons, most often if there is concern for the mother's or baby's health. Labor can be induced by: Ripening the cervix: As you get closer to labor, your cervix begins to soften, thin out, and open. These changes allow the baby to move through the birth canal. To ripen your cervix, your provider may use a balloon catheter or apply the hormone prostaglandin to your cervix. Stripping the membranes: Your provider inserts a finger through the vagina and cervix. Then swipes their finger across the thin membrane that connects the amniotic sac to the wall of your uterus. When the membranes are stripped, your body releases natural prostaglandins. Breaking your water (also called rupturing the membranes): If your cervix has started to open and your baby's head is down close to the cervix, your provider may use a small plastic hook to break the amniotic sac. Stimulating contractions: If other methods have not started regular contractions, you may be given the medication Pitocin through an intravenous (IV) line. Contractions should start within 30 minutes. Pitocin is always given in the hospital. 11 Third Trimester Hospital Stay Labor Starts When labor begins call the hospital and let them know you plan to come in. This will allow us to prepare for your arrival. Arrive at the Hospital Your first stop when arriving may be to our triage room. Here our expert nurses will check your progress and make sure your baby is ready for labor. It is common for patients to be sent home. Remember, babies come at their own time. If it is time for you to stay, we will have you fill out any needed forms to admit you to the hospital. We will also review your wishes for birth. This is to make sure your experience is centered on what you feel is best for you and your baby. If you are being induced, your health care team will give you instructions on how to prepare for delivery. Labor and Delivery Your next stop will be the labor and delivery room. This room is where you will stay until after you deliver your baby. Here you will meet your expert labor and delivery nurse, who will care for you. Communication between you and your care team is very important. Things can happen quickly, open communication helps ensure we are able to best support you. Feel free to share how you feel or your wishes at any time. Below are some things that happen to most moms: You will be asked to wear a hospital gown or a personal clothing item that you brought with you that is comfortable and supports care. Physical exams will be done as needed to monitor progress. A blood sample will be taken. An IV may be placed in your arm. Your contractions will be monitored by either feeling your abdomen or with an electronic monitor. The provider will be involved during your labor to understand your needs and wants, and to check on your progress. They will also be present during your baby's delivery. 1112 Third TrimesterBirth Experience Options Birthing Birthing options differ. Talk with your healthcare team about the options available in your area. Pain Management Comfort positions Wh irlpool tub bath or shower Or al pain medicationPain medication in IV Ni trous oxide La bor epidural There are lots of positions and ways to help you be comfortable during labor including using a birthing ball.

Bonding We work with you to best support bonding between you and your baby.
