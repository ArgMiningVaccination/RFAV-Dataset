This includes experience advising and representing employers of all sizes and across virtually all industries in connection with union representation campaigns, collective bargaining negotiations, strike preparations, labor arbitrations, and National Labor Relations Board proceedings. UNION CAMPAIGNS Ogletree Deakins has extensive experience representing management in union representation campaigns. Since its inception in 1977, the firm has represented clients confronted with every form of union organizing activity. From union card signing activity and traditional union campaigns involving NLRB elections, to campaigns involving various levels of neutrality, to multi-site and even global attacks, to corporate campaigns, our attorneys have represented clients effectively, efficiently and successfully. POSITIVE EMPLOYEE RELATIONS STRATEGIES Ogletree Deakins has been a pioneer in developing strategies and practices that create positive employee relations. Through these legal, thoughtful approaches, enlightened employers work to develop a trust relationship with employees that minimize the risk of unionization. From vulnerability assessments, to issue identification and resolution systems, to program development and related management training, Ogletree Deakins lawyers work closely with clients to achieve positive employee relations. COLLECTIVE BARGAINING Ogletree Deakins' attorneys have also represented clients with bargaining units of all sizes, and with all major unions, in countless collective bargaining negotiations. Our attorneys are very experienced in handling the numerous matters that comprise collective bargaining, including wage rates and structures; health insurance, retirement plans and other benefits issues; productivity, performance, attendance, discipline, and other accountability measures; transfer of work, facility closure, subcontracting, and other management rights; and promotion, transfer, and layoff and recall rights, including ensuring management authority to fill positions based on skills and qualifications. STRIKE PREPARATIONS Preparing for a strike or work stoppage is a task no company looks forward to undertaking, but is essential as part of the bargaining process and to ensure that (in the worst case) the company is protected. Ogletree Deakins' attorneys routinely work closely with our clients in making detailed preparations that are necessary in advance of a strike, and help them execute this strategy as needs require. LABOR ARBITRATIONS Ogletree Deakins attorneys routinely handle labor arbitrations for our clients with unionized workforces. Our lawyers have represented clients in labor arbitrations in virtually all industries and with all major unions. This experience includes discipline and discharge matters; management rights disputes, including work relocations, subcontracting, layoffs, and work jurisdiction matters; benefits disputes, including health and retirement benefit disputes; and interest arbitration. NLRB PROCEEDINGS When traditional labor disputes end up before the National Labor Relations Board, our attorneys also have a wealth of experience before the NLRB and the Courts of Appeal. This includes the defense of unfair labor practice charges against employers, including those alleging unlawful terminations, failure to bargain in good faith, and conduct allegedly interfering with employee rights; the prosecution of union unfair labor practice charges for unlawful picketing and boycott activities, failure to bargain in good faith, and other violations of the National Labor Relations Act; and in representation proceedings, including unit determination and election proceedings, objections hearings, decertifications, and other unit and representation disputes.
