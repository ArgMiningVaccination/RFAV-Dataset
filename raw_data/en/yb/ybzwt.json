All practitioners hold certification in their chosen profession and undergo further training in Anthroposophic principles and practice. Rudolf Steiner, (1861-1925) an Austrian spiritual scientist and initiate, propounded the philosophy that, today is called Anthroposophy. (Anthropos- Human being, Sophia -Wisdom) It covers the basis for all that is governing the planet earth, with the Human being at the epicentre of it. Anthroposophic medicine, including general and oncological medicine and surgery in private practice and hospitals, anthroposophic nursing, eurythmy therapy, art therapy, massage therapy, artistic speech therapy, music therapy, chirophonetics, Biodynamic farming, Pedagogy and Waldorf schools, Care for the less able (previously Curative Education with residential and non-residential care), Chemistry, Architecture, and more. Anthroposophic practitioners seek to understand all aspects of the person with the illness. The wisdom of the human being is the bedrock on which rests the management and therapy of illness and disease. It considers all the processes and systems of the body, soul and spirit. The Physical Body is something we share with all minerals and earthly substances which are condensed, hard, inanimate and lifeless. Another aspect of the human being is that which makes it live. A life force which we call the Etheric Body and we share with the plant world. It has water as its element. Our movement and feelings are what we share with the animal world. This we refer to as the Astral Body. It has the mobile air as its element. The one feature that distinguishes the human being from all other objects and living things is the ability to think, speak, choose, decide and judge. It is the Ego Body, the \"I\" which brings these abilities into the Human being. It is related to Warmth or Fire. The presence of these four bodies or sheaths work in harmony and balance to provide for ease and health. The absence of balance between them may give rise to illness and disease. The three functional parts of the human being are: The Nerve-sense system streams from above downwards into all parts of the body thus governing the actions of the body of the human being. The Rhythmic system is in the middle and includes the heart and lungs. These are the rhythmic organs which function incessantly in the body until death. The Metabolic-limb system in the lower aspect of the physical body contributes to providing the energy and fuel necessary for bodily functions and for movement. It is essential that the cold, still nerve- sense system, and the warming, mobile metabolic- movement system are balanced well in order to ensure good health. The different areas of Anthroposophy encompass varied fields of human endeavour. - - Anthroposophic medicine & therapies - Pedagogy- Waldorf/Steiner Schools - Agriculture- Biodynamic Farming - Eurythmy - Curative education - Camphill movement - Architecture - Economy - Community development Dramatherapy The intentional use of drama/theatre processes to express creativity, balance our soul life and to bring about psychological growth and change. By using our will in a much more energising way than the oppressive action-at-all-costs that is part of our lifestyle, and warming up our body for activity, we are ready to take on a role or to make a useful improvisation for self-awareness. Drama develops the self-reflecting and self-observing capacities of the individual. Healing environments Knowledge of the flow of energy in environments as well as in the human body enable the practitioner to create spaces that are non-toxic for the physical body, soothing and harmonious for the soul, inspiring and uplifting for the spirit. Education and assistance are given to create a healthy nurturing environment in the home and workplace. Massage Therapy Both rhythmical and etheric massage use light rhythmical movements with a characteristic suction quality that gently and persuasively helps to re-establish a dynamic integration of the whole human being. Through essential elements of warmth and movement they stimulate the will to bring about healing. The Anthroposophic approach to massage was developed by Dr Ita Wegman and Rudolf Steiner in the 1920's and joined later by Marguerite Hauschka. Etheric Massage has evolved out of this stream and was developed in Australia by Ulrike Faeste. Natural plant oils are used as a base with a wide range of herbal and metal substances. The massage includes forms for specific organs, such as the liver and kidneys which are deeply beneficial. Medicine Medical knowledge and skilful diagnosis can be enriched through an understanding of the phenomena of illness and health. The goal is always to find the appropriate medical option that will integrate the patient's personal needs in the context of their biography. All medical disciplines including surgery and dentistry are represented in Anthroposophic Medicine. Nursing Throughout all phases of life, care is integral to healing. The anthroposophic nurse begins from the premise that the spirit is always health and that an illness is not accidental, but the chance to develop the patient's biography further. Accompanying the patient during this phase with the right gestures of compassion, personal sacrifice and mediation the nurse can support the patient's capacity to cope with discomfort and pain. By using traditional methods such as compresses, ointments and oils alongside medicinal substances the need for invasive intervention is often significantly reduced. Such nursing demands heightened perceptions and skills which are developed through the study and practice of Anthroposophy. Painting, Drawing and Sculpture Anthroposophic art therapy helps the patient to repair and reclaim lost balance and harmony. Beginning with the primeval element of creation, and using tools of colour, form and modelling with clay in a meditatively concentrated way, the patient can again unite all the parts which have become disconnected. Through this, balance and wholeness can be regained. Pharmaceutical Working pharmaceutically within Anthroposophy, we undertake the preparation and transformation of elements of the natural kingdoms through a variety of pharmaceutical processes and an attitude of soul, to bring forth preparations of therapeutic value. Psychotherapy and counselling Extends conversational counselling to embrace direct experiences through body awareness, movement, visualization and sound work. The individual's free will is engaged in the process of encouraging self-awareness, empowerment, healing and transformation. Artistic Speech therapy Our humanity expresses itself through the gift of speech. Illness can render us speechless or reduce our ability to express ourselves fully and thus weaken our experience of self in the world. Artistic speech therapy uses sound, words, rhythm and gestures to strengthen the connection between body and soul and in so doing engages the will. Eurythmy therapy Through this innovative and highly developed movement therapy, specific exercises are prescribed and taught to stimulate the patient's inner interest in a healthy awareness of movement. This is done through the use of particular elements of speech and music. The dynamics of healthy movement and stability of soul are awakened and consolidated in the patient. Therapeutic singing The singing voice can become a therapeutic tool and singing can serve as an anthroposophic therapeutic modality that addresses the development of all aspects of the human being as described by "}
