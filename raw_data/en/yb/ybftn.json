On January 9, 2008, FDA announced1 it was undertaking enforcem ent actions against seven pharm acies involved in the business of producing and promoting plant- derived prescription drug produc ts, collectively referred to as \"bio-identical\" horm ones through a process known as com pounding. In warn ing letters issued to these pharm acies, FDA ordered the pharm acies to cease m aking false or m isleading efficacy and safety claim s about these products, and threaten ed further regulatory action against the pharm acies if they did not com ply.2 The announcem ent was FDA's long-awaited response to a Citizen Petition (CP)3 filed in October 2005 by Wyeth, the m anufacturer of the comm only prescribed commercial drug Pr emarin\u00ae. The CP had dem anded that FDA undertake enforcem ent actions against seve ral com pounding pharm acies which it claim ed were really m anufacturing new drugs under the guise of compounding, in effect m aking an \"end-run\" around the new drug approval requirem ents of the 1938 Federal Food, Drug, and Cosm etic Act (the Act).4 How all of the nam ed pharm acies will reac t to FDA's warning letters rem ains to be seen. This recent battle between FDA and pharm acies over bio-identical horm ones is the latest episode in the often contentious debate s surrounding two big issues: (1) w ho has jurisdiction over pharm acy com pounding;5 and (2) how to balance regulation of commercial speech with FDA attem pts to re strict the advertising and promotion of prescription drugs. Pharm acy Com pounding of Prescription Drugs Com pounding is an essential, core practice of pharm acists6 and is defined as \"the preparation, m ixing, assembling, packaging or labeling of a drug or device (i) as the result of a practitioner's prescripti on drug order or initiative based on the pharm acist/patien t/prescriber re lationship in the course of professional practice.\"7 1 FDA Webview, Statement on Compounding, available at http://www.fda veb.com (last a ccessed January 10, 2008). 2 Id. 3 Wyeth Citizen Petitio n to FDA, Docket 2005-0411, Re: Citizen Petitio n seek ing FDA actio ns to counter flagrant violations of the law by pharmacies compounding bio-identical hormone replacement therapy, drugs that end anger public health.

Com pounded drugs are thus individualized and by the pharm acy profession's own statem ents before Congress8 are replacem ents for com parable comm ercial prescription drugs known to be safe and effective. At the pres ent tim e, however, m ultiple com pounding pharm acies have b een horm one thera py to an anonym ous, national audience of wom en as a safer and more effective alte rnative for treatm ent of m enopause than commonly prescribed co mmercially m anufact ured prescription drugs. Consum ers m ay not be aware of the fact that there is virt ually no data to suppor t many of the in terne t claim s being m ade for bio-identical horm ones, but m ajor m edical soc ieties such as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists9 and the Endocrine Society have repetitively gone on record at m eetings,10 in journals,11 and before Congress12 for years stating that the health claim s being made for bio-identical hormones have no firm evidentiary basis. The pharm acy industry has consistently argued13 that com pounding of prescription drugs is part of routine pharmacy pr actice and thus subject to regu lation only by the individual states through their state boards of pharm acy. The pharm acy industry thus sees no role for FDA in regulation of pharm acy com poundi ng even though it invo lves prescription drugs which have, by design, never undergone fo rmal safety and efficacy testing unlike nearly all co mmercially m anufactured prescrip tion drugs. FDA argues that it has at least some jurisdiction over pharm acy compounding.14 Clearly the change in the m anner of Pensi ons, 108th Congress (2003) (statement of D aniel A.

Were th is argu ment accepted, t he practice of pha rmacy co mpoundi ng, esse ntial to patie nt care, would cea se to exist because no pharmacy could m eet the effi cacy and safet y new drug approval re quirements of the Act. For t his rea son, FDA chooses to exercise \"enforcem ent discretion\" over pharmacy compoun ding, not seeking to disturb \"traditional compoun ding\" (however defined), and intervening when seco nd 2prom pharm acies, as well as the non-individualiz ed audience they are being m arketed to, has raised significant concerns over whet her th e pharm acy activ ity in q uestion is th e trad itional compounding FDA has expressed it has litt le interest in interfering with,15 or whether what is going on is another kind of pharm acy activity, however defined. The Problem of FDA J urisdiction Over Com pounding The clash between FDA and the pharm acy co mpounding industry is not a new one, and has been in a state of flux even since the Suprem e Court's Western States decision16 of 2002 affir med the 9th Circuit's decisions17 that (1) the com pounding pharm acy advertising and soliciting restrictio ns of \u00a7 503A of the 1997 Food and Drug Adm inistration Modernization Act (FDAMA)18 were violations of the First Am endm ent and unconstitution al restrictions on co mmercial sp eech under the Central Hudson test; and (2) th ese speech restrictions were not se verable from all of the rem aining language dealing with pharm acy com pounding. As a resu lt of the Suprem e Court's decision the entirety of section 503A was void19 and the entire portion of the Act which dealt with pharm acy com pounding was elim inated. Ironically, had FDAMA not contained provision s which ran af oul of First Am endm ent commercial speech doctrine, \u00a7503A would have elim inated much of the current controversy since it form ally acknowledged that pharm acy com pounded prescription drugs were not \"new drugs,\" as defined by the Act,20 and exempted com pounded drugs which sati sfied certain requirem ents from having to satisfy three key provisions of the Ac t: (1) the adulteration provision of section 501(a)(2); (2) the m isbranding provision of 501(f)(1); and (3) the new drug approval provisions of section 505.21 Despite Western States , FDA continues to m aintain tha t it ha s at least so me jurisdiction over pharm acy com pounding. The 2002 Com pliance Policy Guide22 (CPG) contains a list of the factors FDA considers in deciding whet her to exercise its en forcem ent discretion.23 Among those factors are whether a com pounde d product m ay have a potential adverse effect on the public health, whether a firm is compounding finished drugs from bulk active ingredients that are not com ponents of FDA-approved drugs, or whether a firm is compounding drugs that are \"versions\" of dr ugs that were withdrawn or removed from argument for jurisdiction) that the pharmacy activ ity is really manufacturi ng. As noted, there are proble ms with this arg ument as well. 15 Id. 16 West ern States, supra note 6. 17 West ern States Medi cal Center v.

This tr aditiona l activ ity is n ot the subject of this guidance.\"25 No defi nition of \"reasonable quantity\" of compounding, or \"traditional com pounding\" are provided in recent FDA testim ony before Congress on the issue of bio-identical hor mones, and the cu rrent enforc ement actions do not contain a guideline by which FDA can consisten tly distinguish am ong those com pounding pharm acies it seeks to regul ate from those it does not. Federal Courts Have Not Yet Favored FDA Attempts to Regulate Com pounding Federal judges have cons istently rejected the not ion that pharm acy com pounded prescription drugs are \"new drugs\" as defined by the 1938 Federal Food, Drug, and Cosm etic Act.26 This holding was m ost recently re-asserted in the August 30, 2006 decision by United States Di strict Court for t he West ern District of Texas Medical C enter Pharmacy v. Gonzales.27 In this bench trial a federal j udge granted the plaintiffs' m otion for summ ary judgm ent against FDA and he ld, among other things, that lawfully compounde d prescriptio n drugs for hum ans fa ll outside the d efinition of \"new drugs. \"28 The Court forcefully rejected FDA's effo rts to claim that a pharm acy compounded drug is a \"new drug\" and to assert jurisdicti on over prescription drug com pounding by this argum ent.29 Specifically, the Court found that \"e xtemporaneous com poundi ng of drugs is authorized under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7353a (Section 503A of the FDCA) and such com pounding is thereby exempted from the [new] drug appr oval process and outside the scope of the definition s of 'new drug' and 'new of the FDCA.\"30 This decisio n has been appealed to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals; at the time of this writing a decision is pending. The other argum ent which both FDA and the pharm aceutical industry h ave m ade in court against compounding pharm acies is to claim that they are really \"m anufac turers.\" This argum ent is also prob lematic. First, there is a statutory basis fo r the str aightforward notion th at a pharm acy engaged in th e practice of com poundi ng cannot, b y definition, be a manufacturer, and is th erefore not subject to the manufacturing requirements of the Act.31 Second, federal judges have rejected the \"volum e of business\" argum ent as a way 24 Id. 25 Id. 26 Under the specific language of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 360(g)(1) and 374 (a)(2)(A), pharmacies are e xpressly exem pt from FDA registratio n as manufacturers FDAM A's orig inal provisions essen tially exempted the overwhelming majority of compoun ded prescription drugs from the core new drug approval requirements of the Act.

Tex. 2006). 28 Id. 29 Id. 30 Covington & Burling. Food & Drug E-Alert. \"Western District of Texas Compounding Deci sion on Medical Center Pharmacy v. Gonzales. September 27, 2006, available at www.c ov.com (last accessed Decem ber 23, 2007). 31 Under the specific language of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 360(g)(1) and 374 (a)(2)(A), pharmacies are e xpressly exem pt from FDA registratio n as manufacturers FDAM A's orig inal provisions exempted \"com pounding\" occurring.32 Indeed, the cour t in the f irst Western States decision rejected this line of reasoning in unusually forceful terms,33 and this approach wa s tacitly af firmed by all courts in the subsequent Western States decisions.34 Given that com pounding pharm acies m ay prepare com pound prescription drugs in reasonabl e anticipation of re ceiving a prescription, and that som e compounding pharm acies will, becau se of econom ies of scale, unavoidab ly be invo lved in the production of large num bers of similar compounded prescription drugs (particu larly so for BHRT), it is an u navoidable that there will be som e large volum e compounding by som e pharm acies. Adding to the confusion has been the use of the term s \"traditional com pounding\" and \"bulk com poundi ng\" by HHS Chief Counsel without providing m eaningful definitions of either term .35 Is FDA's Enforcem ent Action Appropriate? Is What's Going On Really Com pounding ? Of course, the \"traditional com poundi ng\" both F DA and the pharm acy industry constan tly refer to is an undefined entity which both the internet, en trepreneurial pharm acy business practices and pharm acy i ndustry econom ies of scal e are relegating to the past. However, both FDA and the pharm acy profession employ sim ilar definitions of what com pounding is (and by im plication what \"trad itional com pounding\" is), and this definition36 actually provides som e guidance as to how FDA can assert jurisdiction, and control, over som e of the predom inatel horm therapies as a wholesale replacem ent for all wom en instea d of commercially available p rescription drugs which are known to be safe and e ffective is, by the Pharm acy industry's own overwhelming majority of compoun ded prescription drugs from the core new drug approval requirements of the Act. The FDC A does contain exem ptions to its manufact uring provisions for pharmacies. The atute exem pts pha rmacies from the regi stration and inspect ion requirements for manufact urers provided the pharmacies meet certain requi rements, suc h as com plying with state laws and performing compounding activ ities in their no rmal co urse of business, an d as such protects a bro ad range of pharmacy co mpounding practices from the trad itional regulatory requirem ents of m anufacturers .. 32 West ern States Medi cal Center v.

A \"com pounde d drug product is a drug produc t made in response to, or in anticipation of, receipt of a valid prescri ption orde r or a notation on a valid presc ription order from a licensed practitione r that state s the compounded product is necessa ry fo r the ide ntified patient.\" In m any instances of u se of bio-identical hormone prescrip tions the substitution over a co mmercial drug product is not \" necessa ry\" in the medical sense. 5admission, not com pounding.37 This o pens the doo r to an FDA argum ent that what is being done is not com pounding. A recent co mprehensive review of bio-iden tical h ormone therapy38 concluded that \"although individualized horm one pr oducts m ay decrease som e symptom s of m enopause, it seem s they have no proven advantage over conventional horm one therapies and their use is not supported by evidence regarding pharm acokinetics, safety, and efficacy.\"39 There is enough legitim ate direct scientific litera ture to dem onstrate that m any of the medical benefit and safety claim s made by some internet-based com pounding pharm acies are e ither blatantly f alse or scien im possible.40 Just as importantly, the essential \"triad\" relationship41 between patient, physician, a nd com pounding pharm acist which characterized true com pounding is absent in som e of these com pounding activities when pharm acies activ ely so licit pa tient business d irectly v ia the interne t instead of waitin g to receive prescriptions from a physician. Conclusion The real question is whether FDA is prepared to undertake more drasti c action to reign in a pharm acy practice which is a real p ublic health issue and th us well with in FDA's mission statem ent.42 As it is, it took F DA al most three years from the tim e of its initial review of Wyeth's Citizen's Petition to re spond, and then all it did was send warning letters to seven pharm acies, none of which ar e the biggest players in the bio-identical horm one therapy industry. FDA already lack s the m edical resources to adequately monitor post-m arketing surveillance of drugs, devices, vaccines, and foods in the United States ;43 whether it is p repared to s eize large batches of bio-identical horm ones m ade by compounding pharm acies is open to question. However, if FDA elects to fulfill its mission and decides to engage select com poundi ng pharm acies head-on, it will h ave to come up with som ething other than th e new drug or m anufacturing argum ents consistently rejected by f ederal courts.
