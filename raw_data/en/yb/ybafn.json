Open your eyes a little bigger now. Would you like a better body? How about some optimal health? You may need to open your mind and your heart a little more as well. Take a deep breath. Can you feel it? God is communicating with you right now. He wants to give you knowledge. The Bible is filled with scriptures. Some are stories, some are songs to bring you joy and hope, some are parables meant to convey his religious message, and some are instructions for our lives to be led with moral character. Do you dare to know the true? Knowledge will make a difference in your life, your family's life, and your friends' lives. Then you will know the truth, and the true will set you free (John 8:32). How good will you feel when you can understand the mystery ingredients in vaccines. Vaccines never freely share their ingredients with you; they are mysterious. We are told that they are safe. But are they? And what are they? And where do they come from? And what do they do to our bodies? These ingredients are contaminated with toxic chemicals that our bodies were never meant to be injected with. Some folks say vaccines are necessary. Well, I am here to tell you that God has already made you uniquely perfect. We do not need these man made additives to protect us. Our bodies are created by God. He made us resilient. He made us capable of healing ourselves. He made us in his image. The power is within us, our minds, and bodies. We are temples for the Holy Spirit to dwell in. If you would like to take hold of your very own precious life and stop being a robot that is told what to do in the name of science, well, this book is for you. We are not to be science experiments. Science and faith can go hand in hand. Research proves outcomes. God is the almighty physician. Let his word be our prescription for what ails us. In this book, you will find every vaccine currently being offered and its ingredients listed scientifically and defined in plain English. Not only that, but you will also have a chance to surf the Bible and read scripture in its full content. I have paired biblical reference and scientific research to show that there is evidence in the Bible that warrants a need for religious exemption from immunizations to protect ourselves in a holy manner. Jesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom, and healing every disease and sickness among the people "}
