Step 2 is Oxygenation via Ozone Therapy. One of the most important factors in healing is oxygen. Ozone is a naturally occurring energy-rich molecule embodying unique physico-chemical and biological properties. Ozone helps improve oxygen delivery in your body by causing more oxygen to be released by hemoglobin and improving red cell flexibility. This leads to an increase in the amount of oxygen released to the tissues. Ozone therapy also helps to inactivate bacteria, viruses, fungi, yeast and protozoa by disrupting the integrity of the bacterial cell envelope making them vulnerable to oxidation and elimination from the body, replacing them with healthy cells. 10 benefits of ozone therapy: Improved Immune System.
