I walk you through the whole process, firstly with discussing whether the program is suitable for you in a discovery call. Once we decide to go ahead, I gather all your information and send you off for a blood test. Your plan is then developed from the results of this. I step you through the 4 stages of your program for long-term health management. 1. book your discovery call The first step is to have a discovery call so I can assess whether the program will be suitable for you. 2. get your blood test At your first appointment, you will receive the referral form for your blood test to be done. After 1 week of this generally your plan has been created. 3. receive Your plan Once your plan is complete, we sit and go through it together and discuss anything that may come up. You will receive a lovely starter pack, your plan, a shopping list, meal plan, use of an app for shopping and some bonus goodies. 4. ongoing support Over the next 12 weeks we will have regular appointments to check your progress, nut out any concerns you may have and move you through the 4 stages of the program.

At 36, I was struggling to lose weight despite large doses of thyroxine been administered, and trying various methods. Fasting/ small grazing/ limited food/ exercise etc. I visited Janelle, having never been to a naturopath before... I was desperate to try anything to shift the weight. She recommended metabolic balance would be an ideal program for me to try. After 2 weeks, I felt amazing. I lost 8kg in 4 weeks. Huge energy and confidence gain. I just stumbled across this list of issues that I took to my GP, just before starting Metabolic balance. Here is what was on the list: - Irregular heavy periods lasting for days - Inflammation - overall puffiness - Stiff joints in the morning (Dr query rheumatoid arthritis, blood tests came back negative) - I had cut out all dairy for 6 months, still no difference I now have no issues with any of these and feel the best that I have felt in years.
