Vaccine FAQ When is my turn to get the vaccine? All Hartig Drug pharmacies and clinics will administer vaccine in accordance with State and county defined eligibility parameters. Each of the counties in which we operate define their own allocation plan and priority. Hartig drug will provide updates via email, social media and news outlets. Will I receive the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine? Vaccines are based on availability, and Hartig Drug will administer based on the type of vaccine received. Both vaccines are safe and effective. The FDA, CDC, and ACIP have not declared preference for one vaccine over another. Do I have to get both doses? Nearly all COVID-19 vaccines being studied in the United States require two shots. The first shot starts building protection and primes the immune system, but everyone has to come back a few weeks later for the second shot to get the most protection the vaccine can offer and strengthen the immune response. How is the vaccine distributed? Each county will progress through the following Phases, with additional tiering within some phases: - Phase 1A: limited doses available for persons in healthcare settings (primarily long-term care facilities) - Phase 1B: limited doses available for frontline essential workers (definition varies) & age 65 years and older - Phase 1C: Pending Federal, State and local public health review and approval - Phase 2: Pending Federal, State and local public health review and approval - Phase 3: Pending Federal, State and local public health review and approval What kind of side effects should people expect from the vaccine? The most commonly reported side effects of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which typically lasted several days, were pain at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle pain, chills, joint pain and fever. Of note, more people experienced these side effects after the second dose than after the first dose, so it is important for vaccination providers and recipients to expect that there may be some side effects after either dose, but even more so after the second dose. The most commonly reported side effects of the Moderna vaccine were similar including injection site pain, fatigue, headache, muscle and joint pain, and chills. "}
