The community should heighten vigilance for protection against influenza. The surveillance data of the Centre for Health Protection (CHP) showed that the weekly percentage of detections tested positive for seasonal influenza viruses has increased gradually since early July and reached 9.83% last week, which was higher than the baseline threshold of 9.21%. Majority of the detections was influenza A(H3) viruses. An increasing influenza-associated admission rate in public hospitals was observed, particularly in children aged below 12 years. Members of the public should maintain good personal protection against seasonal influenza. Particularly, children, elderly and chronic disease patients are urged to receive seasonal influenza vaccination as early as possible for personal protection as it takes about two weeks to develop antibodies in the body after vaccination. They should seek medical advice promptly if influenza-like symptoms develop so that appropriate treatment can be initiated as early as possible to prevent potential complications. Young children, elderly and patients with chronic diseases are prone to influenza infection and its complications. As schools and organisations are collective assembly places, infectious diseases such as influenza could be easily spread among people through their daily contacts. Sources of infection could come from staff, visitors or students (especially those having active symptoms). In this regard, we would like to urge you to reinforce preventive measures in schools, kindergartens and child care centres so as to mitigate the impact of seasonal influenza. - 2 - Schools should actively check the body temperature of all students every day during this influenza season when they arrive at school so as to identify students with fever. This additional measure should continue until the local influenza activity returns to the baseline level. By then, the CHP will issue another letter to inform you. To prevent outbreaks of influenza and other respiratory infections, it is of prime importance that children with fever (oral temperature higher than 37.5, or ear temperature higher than 38), regardless of the presence of respiratory symptoms, should not be allowed to attend school. Staff should be alert of their own conditions every day and should refrain from work if they have fever or respiratory symptoms. It is also important to measure and record students' body temperature properly. Please refer to Section 2.3 of the \"Guidelines on Prevention of Communicable Diseases in Schools /Kindergartens /Kindergartens-cum-Child Care Centres /Child Care Centres\" published by the CHP for detailed information on monitoring of body temperature, which can be accessed at: http://www.chp.gov.hk/files/pdf/guidelines_on_prevention_of_communicable _diseases_in_schools_kindergartens_kindergartens_cum_child_care-centres_c hild_are_centres.pdf Vaccination is one of the most effective ways to prevent seasonal influenza and its complications. To increase seasonal influenza vaccination (SIV) uptake amongst school students, the Department of Health strongly encourages your school to arrange outreach seasonal influenza vaccination service at your campus to protect your students, if not yet done. Should your school wish to organise school outreach vaccination activities, you may still enrol in the Seasonal Influenza Vaccination School Outreach (Free of Charge) Programme 2023/24. Under the Programme, all school students of the participating schools can receive free seasonal influenza vaccination, through Public-Private-Partnership (PPP) vaccination teams. Alternatively, you can invite doctors from the list published on the Centre for Health Protection (CHP) website under the Vaccination Subsidy Scheme School Outreach (Extra Charge Allowed) to provide subsidised outreach vaccination services for your students. For more information on how to arrange outreach vaccination activities, please visit the following website: https://www.chp.gov.hk/en/features/100634.html . Besides receiving seasonal influenza vaccination as early as possible for personal protection, the following measures are advised to prevent - 3 - influenza and respiratory tract infections: Surgical masks can prevent transmission of respiratory viruses from ill persons. It is essential for persons who are symptomatic (even if having mild symptoms) to wear a surgical mask; For high-risk persons (e.g. persons with underlying medical conditions or persons who are immunocompromised), wear a surgical mask when taking public transport or staying in crowded places. It is important to wear a mask properly, including performing hand hygiene before wearing and after removing a mask; Avoid touching one's eyes, mouth and nose; Wash hands with liquid soap and water properly whenever possibly contaminated; When hands are not visibly soiled, clean them with 70 to 80 per cent alcohol-based handrub; Cover the nose and mouth with tissue paper when sneezing or coughing. Dispose of soiled tissue paper properly into a lidded rubbish bin, and wash hands thoroughly afterwards; Maintain good indoor ventilation; When having respiratory symptoms, wear a surgical mask, refrain from work or attending classes at school, avoid going to crowded places and seek medical advice promptly; and Build up good body immunity by having a balanced diet, exercise regularly, take adequate rest, do not smoke and avoid overstress. If you notice an increase in fever or respiratory illnesses among children/ students, clients or staff, please report promptly to the Central Notification Office of investigations and outbreak control.
