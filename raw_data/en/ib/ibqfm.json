Located in Self Experience, p. 37.) Posture: Sit in Easy Pose with a straight spine. Keep your chin in and your chest out. Focus: Close your eyes and meditate. Breath: Not specified. Mantra: If you wish to use a mantra with this meditation, you may use \"Har, Haray, Haree, Wahe Guru.\" You may chant it out loud, chant it mentally or listen to a musical tape of the mantra. It is your choice. Mudra: Raise your right arm straight up with the palm facing forward. Stretch your left arm straight out to the side parallel to the floor with the palm facing down. Split the fingers of each hand so that the Sun and Mercury (ring and little) fingers are together and the Jupiter and Saturn (index and middle) fingers are together. Time: 11 minutes maximum. Comments: To practice this meditation for 40 days, alternate the arm position each day. The first day you practice with the right arm up and the left arm out to the side. The next day stretch the left arm up and the right arm out to the side and so on. (You must always keep your elbows straight.) Your body will start healing itself after the first 2 minutes. The entire cellular system will interact to heal you. Your body shall start healing and every muscle shall start hurting. This posture will hurt as long as you have any toxins in your body. This is central nervous system control therapy. In exactly 11 minutes, your entire cellular system shall change. After 40 days the meditation will start working on your subtle bodies. Whatever starts happening to you after 40 days, keep to yourself. Don't speak of it to anyone. This is the most powerful self-purification you can do. It can give you complete control of your being. It improves intuition and makes you powerful and healthy. You'll be free of all garbage: physical, mental and spiritual. The mantra, \"Har Haray Haree Wahe Guru,\" can be translated, \"The creative aspect of God. Wow! Ecstasy!\" It is a mantra of the indescribable and ecstatic experience of God's creativity and abundance. \u00a9 The Teachings of Yogi Bhajan - All Rights Reserved All teachings, yoga sets, techniques, kriyas and meditations courtesy of The Teachings of Yogi Bhajan.
