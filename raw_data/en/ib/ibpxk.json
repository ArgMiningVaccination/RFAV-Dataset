Global Advances in Health and Medicine Introduction Anthroposophic medicine is a form of integrative medicine that originated in Europe but is not well known in the US. It is comprehensive and heterogenous in scope and remains provocative and controversial in many academic circles. Assessment of the nature and potential contribution of anthroposophic medicine to whole person care and global health seems appropriate. Methods Because of the heterogenous and multifaceted character of anthroposophic medicine, a narrative review format was chosen. A Health Technology Assessment of anthroposophic medicine in 2006 was reviewed and used as a starting point. A Medline search from 2006 to July 2020 was performed using various search terms and restricted to English. Books, articles, reviews and websites were assessed for clinical relevance and interest to the general reader. s of German language articles were reviewed when available. Reference lists of articles and the author's personal references were also consulted. Results The l...

Bielefeld: Transcript Verlag. 2018 Drug design, development and therapy 2009 Anthroposophic medications (AMED) are prescribed in 56 countries. To study clinical outcomes in patients prescribed AMED for chronic disease. Prospective cohort study. 110 medical practices in Germany. 665 consecutive outpatients aged 1-71 years, prescribed AMED for mental, respiratory, musculoskeletal, neurological, genitourinary, and other chronic diseases. Disease and Symptom Scores (physicians' and patients' assessment, 0-10) and SF-36. During the first six months, an average of 1.5 AMED per patient was used, in total 652 different AMED. Origin of AMED was mineral (8.0% of 652 AMED), botanical (39.0%), zoological (7.2%), chemically defined (13.0%), and mixed (33.0%). From baseline to six-month-follow-up, all outcomes improved significantly: Disease Score improved by mean 3.15 points (95% confidence interval 2.97-3.34, p < 0.001), Symptom Score by 2.43 points (2.23-2.63, p < 0.001), SF-36 Physical Component Summary by 3.04 points (2.16-3.91, p < 0.001), and SF-36... Global advances in health and medicine : improving healthcare outcomes worldwide 2014 Anthroposophic medicine is a physician-provided complementary therapy system that was founded by Rudolf Steiner and Ita Wegman. Anthroposophic therapy includes special medicinal products, artistic therapies, eurythmy movement exercises, and special physical therapies. The Anthroposophic Medicine Outcomes Study (AMOS) was a prospective observational multicenter study of 1631 outpatients starting anthroposophic therapy for anxiety disorders, asthma, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, depression, low back pain, migraine, and other chronic indications under routine conditions in Germany. AMOS INCORPORATED TWO FEATURES PROPOSED FOR THE EVALUATION OF INTEGRATIVE THERAPY SYSTEMS: (1) a sequential approach, starting with the whole therapy system (use, safety, outcomes, perceived benefit), addressing comparative effectiveness and proceeding to the major system components (physician counseling, anthroposophic medicinal products, art therapy, eurythmy therapy, rhythmical massage therapy... 2018 Scandinavian Journal of Caring Sciences Anthroposophic health care is rooted in the work of Steiner and Wegman in Switzerland during the 1920s. The Swedish hospital in this study offers integrated conventional and anthroposophic health care therapies which are conceptualized as an extended and integrative variant of health care and not as CAM. In anthroposophic care, health is viewed as a matter of body, soul and spirit in balance. Therapeutic resources include nursing care, therapeutic conduct (art and body therapies) and medicines based on natural remedies. This study aims to deepen the understanding of what constitutes good care from a patient's perspective to alleviate patients' suffering and to identify clinical markers for good care. As anthroposophic care is associated with theory and holistic ideas, this study aims at exploring whether or not anthroposophic care has a beneficial effect. A qualitative method was used, and the analysis was conducted with a phenomenological hermeneutic approach. Sixteen forme... Journal of bacteriology and infectious diseases 2020 Background. Measles outbreaks continue to occur in Europe as a result of suboptimum vaccination coverage. This article aims to describe individuals susceptible to measles, and provide an overview of affected groups and the public settings in which measles transmission occurred in Europe in 2005-2009. Methods. Individuals susceptible to measles were described and categorized on the basis of factors leading to nonvaccination and vaccine failure. A literature search was conducted to identify affected groups and public settings in which measles transmission occurred. Results. Most individuals susceptible to measles are previously uninfected and unvaccinated. The reasons for nonvaccination in individuals eligible for vaccination ranged from lack of information to poor access to health care. Several outbreaks have emerged in Roma and Sinti, Traveller, anthroposophic, and ultra-orthodox Jewish communities, and immigrants identifying them as being particularly at risk. Public settings for transmission included mostly educational and health care facilities. Conclusions. Improved efforts are needed to strengthen immunization programs, identify barriers for measles-containing vaccine uptake, and explore methods to target vulnerable populations that are not being reached with routine immunization delivery services. Specific measures are needed to prevent and control measles in educational and health care facilities. Failure to identify who gets measles and implement the elimination strategies raises concerns for the successful and sustainable elimination of measles in Europe. Vaccine 2014 Background: This paper examines a paradox in the German healthcare system: Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) practices are a major element of medical encounters in Germany. Patients seek them, physicians provide them, and public health insurances pay for them in part. Despite all this, CAM practices are not acknowledged as scientifically valid. Material and Method: I will examine this situation in detail based on 2 ethnographic studies. The first study refers to an attempt to introduce homeopathic education at a German university. The second one is a study in the context of cancer and CAM. These cases are perfect examples of the current power struggles that are impeding the expansion of CAM practices in Germany. Results: The results should be seen from the theoretical angle of the study of science. The conventional method of proving scientific validity is in contradiction to those frameworks in which the impact of CAM might be demonstrated. There are economic interests invested in preventing the integration of CAM into existing scientific structures. However, the current hybridization of CAM with conventional medicine might be a step towards an institutionalized heterogenization of medical practices in Germany. Conclusions: A broader understanding of scientific methods within the CAM community could provide a useful frame for future research. I suggest that the CAM community more actively takes part in the discourse with representatives of conventional medicine and come out of the closet.
