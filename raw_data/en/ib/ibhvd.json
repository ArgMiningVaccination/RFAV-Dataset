Success in executing NASA's ambitious aeronautics activities and space missions requires solutions to difficult technical challenges that build on proven capabilities and require the development of new capabilities. These new capabilities arise from the development of novel cutting-edge technologies. The promising new technology candidates that will help NASA achieve our extraordinary missions are identified in our Technology Roadmaps. The roadmaps are a set of documents that consider a wide range of needed technology candidates and development pathways for the next 20 years. The roadmaps are a foundational element of the Strategic Technology Investment Plan (STIP), an actionable plan that lays out the strategy for developing those technologies essential to the pursuit of NASA's mission and achievement of National goals. The STIP provides prioritization of the technology candidates within the roadmaps and guiding principles for technology investment. The recommendations provided by the National Research Council heavily influence NASA's technology prioritization. NASA's technology investments are tracked and analyzed in TechPort, a web-based software system that serves as NASA's integrated technology data source and decision support tool. Together, the roadmaps, the STIP, and TechPort provide NASA the ability to manage the technology portfolio in a new way, aligning mission directorate technology investments to minimize duplication, and lower cost while providing critical capabilities that support missions, commercial industry, and longer-term National needs. The 2015 NASA Technology Roadmaps are comprised of 16 sections: The Introduction, Crosscutting Technologies, and Index; and 15 distinct Technology Area (TA) roadmaps. Crosscutting technology areas, such as, but not limited to, avionics, autonomy, information technology, radiation, and space weather span across multiple sections. The introduction provides a description of the crosscutting technologies, and a list of the technology candidates in each section.2015 NASA Technology Roadmaps TA 6: Human Health, Life Support, and Habitation SystemsTA 6 - 3 DRAFTTable of Support Systems and Habitation Systems ............ 6-20 ............................................ 6-21 6.4 Environmental Monitoring, Safety , and .1: Environmental Control and Life Support Systems and Habitation Human Health, Life Support, and Habitation SystemsTA 6 - 4 DRAFTExecutive Summary This is Technology Area (TA) 6: Human Health, Life Support, and Habitation Systems, one of the 16 sections of the 2015 NASA Technology Roadmaps. The Roadmaps are a set of documents that consider a wide range of needed technologies and development pathways for the next 20 years (2015-2035). The roadmaps focus on \"applied research\" and \"development\" activities. This roadmap provides a summary of key capabilities and technologies for the Human Health, Life Support, and Habitation Systems TA, which include game-changing or breakthrough items. These capabilities and technologies are deemed necessary to achieve predicted national and Agency goals in space over the next few decades. The sub-TAs included in the roadmap are Environmental Control and Life Support Systems (ECLSS) and Habitation Systems; Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Systems; Human Health and Performance (HHP); Environmental Monitoring, Safety, and Emergency Response (EMSER); and Radiation. Goals For future crewed missions beyond low-Earth orbit (LEO) and into the solar system, regular resupply of consumables and emergency or quick-return options will not be feasible, and spacecraft will experience a more challenging radiation environment in deep space than in LEO. Therefore, TA 6 focuses on developing technologies that enable long-duration, deep-space human exploration with minimal resupply consumables, increased independence from Earth, within permissible space radiation exposure limits. Planetary protection policy and guidance for Mars missions have not yet been formalized, but will need to be considered at the TA 6 level. Overarching sub-goals include: transitioning from partially-closed life support systems on the International Space Station (ISS) to a more fully-closed integrated system; developing advanced technologies for spacesuits that enable more frequent and rapid EVAs in both microgravity and surface environments (e.g., exposure to dust); significantly improving in-space crew health diagnostics, treatments, and countermeasures; and enabling real-time analysis of a broad range of compounds and microbial organisms in the vehicle. In addition, the radiation effort is focused on developing technologies that increase crewed mission duration (100 to 1,000 days, depending on the mission) in the free-space radiation environment while remaining below the space radiation permissible exposure limits (PELs). Technology snapshots with more detailed performance metrics for various Design Reference Missions are provided in the Appendix of TA 6. Table 1.

Benefits The primary benefit of developing technology for the Human Health, Life Support and Habitation Systems TA is the ability to successfully achieve affordable crewed space missions to LEO and beyond. As a unique, human-tended test platform in the space environment, continued operations and missions on the ISS will directly contribute to the knowledge base and spur advances in these areas in the coming decade. Developing long-duration ground test capabilities and either extending ISS operations or using an alternative permanent or semi-permanent in-space facility would facilitate sustained testing and associated advancements into the following decade as well, in preparation for missions beyond LEO. Ground and in-space test beds will be crucial to the development and validation of technologies needed for those bold space missions. 1 of 13 2015 NASA Technology Roadmaps TA 6: Human Health, Life Support, and Habitation SystemsDRAFT Figure 1.

Technology Area Strategic Roadmap (Continued)TA 6 - 182015 NASA Technology Roadmaps TA 6: Human Health, Life Support, and Habitation SystemsTA 6 - 19 DRAFTIntroduction This roadmap provides a summary of key capabilities necessary to achieve national and Agency goals in human space exploration over the next few decades in the Human Health, Life Support and Habitation Systems technology area (TA). As an example, crewed missions venturing beyond low-Earth orbit (LEO) will require technologies with improved reliability and radiation protection, reduced mass, improved self-sufficiency , and minimal logistical needs, since an emergency or quick-return option will not be feasible. As shown in Figure 2, the sub-TAs included in the roadmap are: Environmental Control and Life Support Systems (ECLSS) and Habitation Systems; Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Systems; Human Health and Performance (HHP); Environmental Monitoring, Safety, and Emergency Response (EMSER); and Radiation. Figure 2. Technology Area Breakdown Structure for Human Health, Life Support, and Habitation Systems TA 6 technologies are specific to the human element and include those that directly affect crew needs for survival and well-being, as well as the environment to which the crew is exposed and interfaces that crew members encounter . For example, water recovery technologies are needed not only for allowing direct human consumption, but also for hygiene and controlling the humidity of the crew' s environment. In addition to shared applications, each sub-TA has unique technological challenges, which will be discussed below.2015 NASA Technology Roadmaps TA 6: Human Health, Life Support, and Habitation SystemsTA 6 - 20 DRAFT6.1 Environmental Control and Life Support Systems and Habitation Systems The main sub-goal of spacecraft life support and habitation systems is to maintain an environment suitable for sustaining human life throughout the duration of a mission. The ECLSS and Habitation System area is typically described as serving four primary functions: 6 .1 .1 Air Revitalization: The overarching function of this area is to maintain a safe and habitable atmosphere within a spacecraft, surface vehicle, or habitat. 6 .1 .2 Water Recovery and Management: This area provides a safe and reliable supply of potable water to meet crew consumption and operational needs.6 .1 .3 Waste Management: The objective of this area is to safeguard crew health, increase safety and performance, recover resources, and protect planetary surfaces, all while decreasing mission costs.6 .1 .4 Habitation: This area focuses on habitation functions that closely interface with life-support systems, including food preparation and production, hygiene, metabolic waste collection, clothing/laundry, and the conversion of logistics trash to resources. While this functional decomposition is helpful for describing ECLSS and habitation systems, it is important to recognize opportunities where combining lower-level functions or applying technology solutions to multiple functions may offer attractive benefits. 6.2 Extravehicular Activity Systems EVA systems are critical to every foreseeable human exploration mission, from in-space microgravity missions in LEO to planetary surface exploration. In addition, a launch, entry , and abort (LEA) suit system is needed to protect the crew during launch, landing, and cabin contamination/depressurization events, as well as the ascent/decent transition for planetary excursions. An EVA system includes hardware and software that spans multiple assets in a given mission architecture and interfaces with many vehicle systems, such as life support, power , communications, avionics, robotics, materials, pressure systems, and thermal systems. The roadmap for TA 7 (Human Exploration Destination Systems), addresses tools that are included with the EVA system. For the purpose of this document, the EVA system includes three subsystems: 6 .2 .1 Pressure Garment: The suit, or pressure garment, is the set of components a crew member wears and uses. It includes the torso, arms, legs, gloves, joint bearings, helmet, and boots. The suit employs a complex system of soft-goods and mobility elements in the shoulders, arms, hips, legs, torso, boots, and gloves to optimize performance while pressurized without inhibiting unpressurized operations. The LEA suit also contains provisions to protect the crew member from both nominal and of f-nominal environments (e.g., gravitational, sound, chemical) encountered during launch, entry , and landing, as well as potential descent/ascent to planetary surfaces. 6 .2 .2 Portable Life Support System (PLSS): The PLSS performs functions required to keep a crew member alive during an EVA. These functions include maintaining thermal control of the astronaut, providing a pressurized oxygen (O 2) environment, and removing products of metabolic output such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O). 6 .2 .3 Power, Avionics, and Software (PAS): The PAS system is responsible for the EVA system's power supply and distribution, collecting and transferring several types of data to and from other mission assets, providing avionics hardware to perform numerous data display and in-suit processing functions, and furnishing information systems to supply data that enables crew members to perform their tasks with more autonomy and efficiency.2015 NASA Technology Roadmaps TA 6: Human Health, Life Support, and Habitation SystemsTA 6 - 21 DRAFT6.3 Human Health and Performance The main sub-goal of the HHP technologies is to maintain the health of the crew and support optimal and sustained performance throughout the duration of a mission. The HHP domain includes four functional focus areas: 6 .3 .1 Medical Diagnosis and Prognosis: This functional area provides a suite of medical technologies, knowledge, and procedures that minimize the likelihood and consequence of of f-nominal medical events during exploration missions. Efforts are also focused on developing novel screening, diagnosis, and treatment technologies for conditions that drive medical risk, as well as developing the appropriate infrastructure to match the level of care required for exploration Design Reference Missions (DRMs). 6 .3 .2 Long-Duration Health: This area focuses on providing validated technologies for medical practice to address the effects of the space environment on human systems and countermeasures to maintain crew physical health, behavioral health, and sustained performance on extended-duration missions. 6 .3 .3 Behavioral Health: The objective in this area is to provide countermeasures and conduct monitoring to reduce the psychosocial, neurobehavioral, and performance risk associated with extended space travel and return to Earth. Technology advancements are needed to identify, characterize, and prevent or reduce risks associated with space travel, exploration, and return to terrestrial life on astronauts' behavioral health and performance 6 .3 .4 Human Factors: This area focuses on technologies that support the crew's ability to effectively, reliably, and safely interact within mission environments. Elements include physical accommodation, fit, ergonomics of crew hardware interfaces, physical and cognitive augmentation, training, and Human-Systems Integration (HSI) tools, metrics, methods, and standards. 6.4 Environmental Monitoring, Safety, and Emergency Response The sub-goals of the EMSER effort are to develop technologies that ensure crew health and safety by protecting against spacecraft hazards and to ensure effective response should an accident occur. This area includes four functions: 6 .4 .1 Sensors: Air, Water, Microbial, and Acoustic: The objective of this area is to provide future spacecraft with advanced, networks of integrated sensors to monitor environmental health and accurately determine and control the physical, chemical, and biological environments of crew living areas and their environmental control systems. 6 .4 .2 Fire: Detection, Suppression, and Recovery: The objective of spacecraft fire safety is to develop technologies that ensure crew health and safety by reducing the likelihood of a fire, or , if one does occur, minimizing the risk to the crew, mission, and/or system.6 .4 .3 Protective Clothing and Breathing: The objective of this area is to provide the crew with sufficient capability to address off-nominal situations within the habitable compartments of the spacecraft. Off- nominal events include fire, chemical release, microbial contamination, and unexpected depressurization. 6 .4 .4 Remediation: The focus of remediation is to provide the crew with the ability to clean the habitable environment of the spacecraft in the event of an off-nominal situation. Off-nominal events include fire, an inadvertent chemical release, or microbial contamination.2015 NASA Technology Roadmaps TA 6: Human Health, Life Support, and Habitation SystemsTA 6 - 22 DRAFT6.5 Radiation The radiation area is focused on developing technologies to increase crew mission duration (100 to 1,000 days, depending on the mission) in the free-space radiation environment while remaining below the space radiation permissible exposure limits (PELs). It is generally accepted that to meet the sub-goal of extending crew mission duration, an integrated, optimized approach utilizing shielding options, biological countermeasures, improved understanding of the risks, and the ability to better predict and monitor the radiation environment will be required. The primary radiation technologies requiring advancement to meet this sub-goal include: 6 .5 .1 Risk Assessment Modeling: The focus of this area is to develop tools that enable, quantify , and reduce uncertainty in assessing astronaut risk due to space radiation exposure, as well as to improve mission operations, mission planning, and system design for LEO, deep-space, lunar , and Mars missions. 6 .5 .2 Radiation Mitigation and Biological Countermeasures (BCM): The focus of this area is to develop BCMs that can minimize or prevent physical, cognitive, and behavioral disorders due to space radiation without adverse side effects and loss of life. 6 .5 .3 Protection Systems: The focus of this area is to advance the design of integrated radiation protection shielding technologies that extend the duration of missions beyond LEO by more than 60 days, within the scope of reasonable vehicle design and mass. The focus is to provide passive or active shielding through design advances, advanced materials, lightweight structures, and in-situ resources. 6 .5 .4 Space Weather Prediction: The focus of this area is to advance improvements in solar particle event (SPE) forecasting and alert systems to minimize operational constraints for missions outside the protection of the Earth's geo-magnetic field. 6 .5 .5 Monitoring Technology: The focus of this area is to prototype and mature advanced, miniaturized radiation measurement technologies, and to demonstrate these technologies as integrated vehicle systems using available platforms.2015 NASA Technology Roadmaps TA 6: Human Health, Life Support, and Habitation SystemsTA 6 - 23 DRAFTTA 6.1: Environmental Control and Life Support Systems and Habitation Systems In short-duration missions lasting days or weeks, open-loop life-support systems, in which stored consumables like water and oxygen are used once by the crew and discarded in various forms of metabolic wastes, typically offer the best combination of simplicity, reliability, and mission mass. As mission durations increase to months and years, the mass of consumables grows until, depending on specific mission parameters, it becomes more advantageous from a life-cycle cost perspective to recover water and oxygen from metabolic byproducts for subsequent re-utilization by the crew. Onboard the International Space Station (ISS), water is recovered from wastewater and oxygen is recovered indirectly from carbon dioxide. The physical-chemical processes that are employed provide safe water and oxygen that meet the metabolic and basic hygiene needs of the crew. However, less than 90% of the available water and less than half of the potential oxygen that could be is actually recovered. Furthermore, the reliance on expendable items like filters and sorbent beds, and the complexities of the systems themselves, create a dependence on the re-supply of equipment and materials from Earth. In LEO, where the ISS operates, equipment and material re-supply can be sustained through the logistics contributions of international partners and United States (U.S.) commercial cargo transportation providers. However, in missions beyond LEO, such re-supply chains will become stretched to the point of limiting the potential for extended-duration human space exploration. It is critically important to evolve and supplement today's Earth-reliant systems and prove their readiness to extend humanity's reach to Mars and other deep-space destinations. Improvements to life support and habitation capabilities are expected to be achieved through a combination of evolutionary improvements to the state of the art (SOA) technologies and system architectures, supplemented with new capabilities and paradigms that have yet to be proven. Demonstration that these improvements have been achieved will require testing in a flight environment for at least two years to prepare for a likely Mars round-trip transit mission duration. The ISS will be an important part of such a proving ground, providing opportunities to integrate and operate technologies within existing systems, independently as separate stand-alone payloads, as part of complete new systems operated independently in a dedicated location or module, or some combination of each strategy. Once proven on the ISS, the suite of technologies will be ready for integration with other systems, such as power and thermal control, for a vehicle-level demonstration of the readiness to proceed on to Mars. The ECLSS and Habitation Systems Technical sub-TA has technologies that crosscut with other sub-TAs in TA 6, as well as with other TAs. Within TA 6, the technologies that require maturation to support Air Revitalization (6.1.1), Water Recovery and Management (6.1.2), and Waste Management (6.1.3) are also relevant to Extravehicular Activity Systems (6.2), albeit on a different scale. Habitation (6.1.4) benefits from technology advances in TA 7 Human Exploration Destination Systems, and TA 12 Materials, Structure, Mechanical Systems and Manufacturing, and all of TA 6.1 can benefit from advances made in TA 10, Nanotechnology. Sub-Goals The overarching sub-goal for environmental control, life support, and habitation is to develop and demonstrate highly reliable capabilities needed to sustain humans for long periods of time in deep space with minimal reliance on Earth-supplied consumables, expendables, replacement equipment, and crew intervention and maintenance, coupled with capabilities to efficiently use in-situ resources and recycle, reuse, and repurpose consumable and expendables. The ISS or other suitable platforms in the relative vicinity of Earth will serve as the proving ground to demonstrate readiness to support missions to Mars and deep-space destinations over mission lengths measured in years. 2015 NASA Technology Roadmaps TA 6: Human Health, Life Support, and Habitation SystemsTA 6 - 24 DRAFTIncreasing closure of water and oxygen loops can pay significant dividends to deep-space missions, but only if the systems involved have the demonstrated reliability needed to avoid mission costs associated with large stored reserves; large, redundant systems; and large inventories of replacement hardware. Overall system reliability and potential reductions in spare equipment should be addressed at both the subsystem (hardware) and complete system levels, Design and operational simplicity , combined with process robustness to unforeseen circumstances and conditions, need to be regarded among the most important measures of \"goodness\" as candidate technologies are developed and compared.

TA 6 .1 .1 Air Revitalization Technical Capability Objectives and Challenges Open-loop air revitalization architectures typically utilize stored oxygen to meet the daily metabolic consumption needs of the crew. Exhaled carbon dioxide is scrubbed from the cabin atmosphere with either expendable media, such as lithium hydroxide, or regenerable media, such as solid amines, from which the carbon dioxide is then vented overboard. Respired and perspired water vapor is also vented overboard, either with the carbon dioxide or separately. Volatile organic compounds emitted by the crew or off-gassed from spacecraft equipment are cleansed from the cabin atmosphere using suitable sorbents and catalytic oxidizers. Fans circulate air through ducting to and from points in the cabin selected to ensure uniform mixing for safety and comfort. Filters mounted at duct inlets capture airborne particulates and microbiological contaminants. Heat exchangers, operated at temperatures above the cabin dew point, collect waste heat from circulated cabin air and transfer it to coolant loops. Closed-loop air revitalization architectures perform the same primary functions as do open-loop architectures, but they do so in a manner specifically designed to preserve precious oxygen and water for re-utilization. This requires additional equipment and operational complexity and, therefore, is not typically implemented unless mission durations are of sufficient length to make it worthwhile. In a closed-loop architecture, rather than venting carbon dioxide overboard, it is adsorbed onto regenerable media, from which it can then be desorbed and delivered to systems designed to recover the oxygen component of the molecule. On the ISS, this is done by reacting the carbon dioxide with hydrogen to produce water and methane in what is referred to as the Sabatier process. The methane is vented overboard while the water, once polished, becomes part 2015 NASA Technology Roadmaps TA 6: Human Health, Life Support, and Habitation SystemsTA 6 - 26 DRAFTof the ISS's water supply. A portion of this water supply is used to generate oxygen for the crew through electrolysis, a process that dissociates water into oxygen and hydrogen. Because the amount of hydrogen produced is proportional to the amount of oxygen needed by the crew, its supply is limited, which then limits the maximum amount of oxygen recoverable from carbon dioxide to no more than half of what's available. Closed-loop air revitalization systems also are distinguished from open-loop systems in that cabin heat exchangers are operated at temperatures below the cabin dew point so that water vapor may be condensed, collected, and delivered to water processing equipment for purification and re-use. The primary air revitalization capability objective is the reliable and efficient recovery of oxygen from carbon dioxide exhaled by crew members. This capability depends on a number of inter-dependent functions, beginning with the removal of carbon dioxide from a spacecraft cabin atmosphere and culminating with the liberation of re-useable oxygen either directly from carbon dioxide or, more typically, from water that is generated as a by-product of carbon dioxide reduction reactions. Durable, robust materials are needed that are suitable for removing carbon dioxide from cabin atmospheres and delivering it to downstream processes for oxygen recovery . The capacity to control carbon dioxide partial pressures to levels measured at less than 2 millimeters of mercury (mmHg) without substantially impacting equipment size and power consumption may be needed to alleviate crew member health issues. Increasing the percentage of oxygen recoverable from carbon dioxide from 50 percent today, to 75 percent initially, and ultimately more than 90 percent, could enable or enhance deep-space exploration, depending on the specific duration and constraints of the missions. Means are needed to simplify the integrated complexity of the SOA water electrolysis system to increase reliability and operational robustness, as is the capability to recharge oxygen storage tanks to pressures up to 3,600 pounds per square inch absolute (psia) with oxygen generated onboard. High-capacity sorbents and high-efficiency oxidizing catalysts are needed to replace obsolete materials in spacecraft trace contaminant control applications. Durable and chemically-inert hydrophilic surfaces with antimicrobial properties are needed to avoid periodically drying out condensing heat exchangers, as well as the problematic conversion of airborne silica-containing compounds into refractory compounds, which are difficult to subsequently extract from recycled water supplies. High-capacity, high-efficiency filtration media that reduce crew time dedicated to routine filter cleaning are needed, as are media and methods suitable for capturing planetary dust particles that may be carried into habitable elements on the suits and equipment of crew members following EV As on planetary surfaces. Benefits of Technology Improving the reliability of air revitalization capabilities will most directly benefit future long-duration human missions beyond LEO by reducing the amount of spare equipment and emergency supplies of oxygen that must be launched from Earth to ensure crew survival and mission success. Secondary benefits can include reducing the amount of crew time dedicated to maintaining systems and allowing more compact packaging of systems which don't require frequent access for maintenance. Reducing the resources needed to maintain carbon-dioxide partial pressures in cabin atmospheres by developing higher-efficiency materials and processes might reduce the incidence of headaches and mitigate cognitive decline among crew members during both short- and long-duration missions. Increasing the percentage of oxygen recoverable from crew member carbon dioxide can reduce the dependence on Earth-based oxygen re-supply and build up oxygen reserves that can subsequently be used to support EVAs and short-duration vehicular excursions away from a primary habitat. Improving the efficiency and capacities of systems that remove particulates from cabin atmospheres can reduce crew time dedicated to filter cleaning and maintenance and can mitigate allergic responses in crew members caused by exposure to particulate-laden air. Dust inadvertently transferred into habitable cabins from Air Revitalization Test Articles2015 NASA Technology Roadmaps TA 6: Human Health, Life Support, and Habitation SystemsTA 6 - 27 DRAFTplanetary bodies, such as the Moon or asteroids, may pose unique risks to crew health due to the absence of Earth-like weathering processes. Processes that take advantage of metabolic pathways available in organisms like algae and bacteria may also provide benefits for carbon dioxide removal, oxygen production, and air purification. A highly reliable system that could remove carbon dioxide from the air and generate oxygen directly from it, while safely and efficiently managing the formation and handling of problematic by-products like carbon monoxide and solid carbon, could offer opportunities to simplify system architectures and reduce resources. Table 3. TA 6.1.1 Technology Candidates - not in priority order TA Technology Name Description 6.1.1.1Carbon Dioxide (CO2) Removal (Closed-Loop)Systems that remove metabolically-generated carbon dioxide from the spacecraft atmosphere to safe levels for the crew, and deliver the carbon dioxide to onboard processes dedicated to the recovery of oxygen. 6.1.1.2 Carbon Dioxide (CO 2) ReductionSystems that recover oxygen from carbon dioxide removed from the spacecraft atmosphere through chemical reactions to reduce the carbon dioxide to other products. 6.1.1.3 Trace Contaminant ControlSystems that remove toxins from the spacecraft cabin atmosphere to below the spacecraft maximum allowable concentrations.

TA 6 .1 .2 Water Recovery and Management Technical Capability Objectives and Challenges Open-loop water management systems meet daily crew needs by delivering water stored in onboard tanks. The tanks are loaded prior to launch and typically contain a residual biocide to maintain microbial cleanliness throughout the mission. Water vapor perspired and respired by the crew is scrubbed from the cabin atmosphere and vented overboard. Urine is collected and discarded overboard. Closed-loop water recovery and management systems purify cabin humidity condensate and crew member urine so that the resulting potable water can be re-used by the crew . On the ISS, chemicals are added to the urine upon collection in order to stabilize it. The stabilized urine is distilled via a vapor compression distillation process. The resulting distillate is combined with cabin humidity condensate and processed through a sequence of operations including degassing, filtration, adsorption, ion exchange, and catalytic oxidation. Iodine is added to the finished water to maintain microbial control; health risks associated with long-term consumption of iodine dictate that the iodine be removed at the delivery point of use. The combination of stabilization chemicals with the constituents of urine, including elevated levels of calcium induced by crew members' physiological responses to the micro-gravity environment, limits the amount of water recoverable from urine today to about 75 percent, beyond which problematic precipitation of solids begins to occur . Even with changes that are currently being made to the formulation of urine-stabilizing solutions, water recovery from urine will likely remain limited to no more than 85 percent without supplemental processing in a solids-tolerant system. 2015 NASA Technology Roadmaps TA 6: Human Health, Life Support, and Habitation SystemsTA 6 - 28 DRAFTAlso of interest are means to reduce the usage rate of expendable media like filters, adsorbents, and ion- exchange resins. Water recovery and management objectives include reliably increasing the percentage of water recovered from urine beyond 85 percent and potentially broadening the types of wastewaters that can be processed. A challenge to achieving water recovery efficiencies of 90 percent or greater is having systems that are resilient to the formation of complex precipitants, which form as water is extracted from increasingly concentrated brine. Reducing reliance on expendable media, such as filtration media, sorbents, and ion-exchange resins is an important capability enhancement as well. Any additional equipment mass required to achieve higher water recovery efficiencies must be substantially less than the water re-supply mass savings to justify the added complexity and risk involved. Other objectives include developing biocides, which are microbiologically effective at concentrations that are safe for long-term human consumption, or alternative microbial control techniques that can assure the long-term safety of stored water supplies. These biocides must be dosed, preferably by passive means, into recycled water supplies within specific target ranges and would preferably be able to maintain anti-microbial effectiveness in stored water reserves for several years. Non-toxic urine pretreatment solutions that effectively prevent microbial growth and the precipitation of solids can reduce potential hazards and simplify system design and operations. Some exploration mission scenarios may also require water recovery and management systems to be tolerant of intermittent periods of dormancy , measured in months and years, between periods of extended operation; having technologies and system architectures that don't require substantial effort to \"safe\" and then reactivate after long periods of dormancy will be required. Benefits of Technology Improving the reliability of water recovery capabilities will most directly benefit future long-duration human missions beyond LEO by reducing the amount of spare equipment and emergency supplemental supplies of water that must be launched from Earth to ensure crew survival and mission success. A secondary benefit of increasing water recovery is the reduction in volume of residual brine (which may be toxic) that must be stored or somehow disposed of. In long-duration missions into deep space, the retention of water mass within a transit or habitation vehicle can provide secondary benefits, like radiation shielding. Highly reliable water-recovery technologies and architectures that depend minimally on expendable media can substantially reduce the stowage volume needed for spare equipment and fresh expendable items. Biocides that are safe for prolonged human consumption at concentrations that effectively prevent microbial growth can simplify system architectures and operations by eliminating the need to strip the biocide out of water prior to its consumption by the crew. By remaining effective over periods of years, such biocides can enable exploration scenarios in which stored water supplies remain safe for immediate use for a year or more prior to or between crew visits. Non-toxic urine pretreatment solutions can reduce the hazard potential associated with fluid leaks and can also enable a greater degree of invasive crew maintenance within systems than would otherwise be safe with more toxic fluids.

This can include biocides, point-of-use filters, or other means.2015 NASA Technology Roadmaps TA 6: Human Health, Life Support, and Habitation SystemsTA 6 - 29 DRAFTTA 6 .1 .3 Waste Management Technical Capability Objectives and Challenges Today, waste management encompasses the collection, containment, and ultimate disposal of solid waste, including crew fecal material (and associated wipes) and wet and dry trash generated by the crew through their daily activities. On the ISS, airflow entrains crew fecal waste and associated wipes into a fixed canister outfitted with individual porous bags. No compaction other than that achieved by the forces of airflow , which draw the bag and its contents to the bottom of the container, is done. Full canisters are removed, capped, and disposed of in departing logistics vehicles. Urine is collected separately and is drawn by airflow into a funnel and hose assembly by a centrifugal device that separates the air from entrained urine. Separation and containment is imperfect, resulting in frequent escapes of urine and fecal materials. Trash is deposited into bags and manually compacted by crew members to minimize volume. Waste management objectives include developing a universal metabolic-waste management system that can be effectively integrated and operated within any type of exploration spacecraft or habitat. Simplicity of use and the effectiveness of material capture and containment are key aspects of this system. Compatibility with potential resource recovery processes, including pretreatment of urine for subsequent water recovery or compaction of solid waste to reduce volume, are required. In the event of a waste management system failure, contingency devices based on passive, capillary-driven fluid containment are needed to enable the continued collection and overboard disposal of crew member urine. The ability to effectively compact and stabilize trash enables long-duration missions and the ability to repurpose trash material to serve other purposes, such as provide radiation protection or alternative fuels, may enhance missions to deep space. Benefits of Technology Universal metabolic waste management systems suitable for integration and used throughout a fleet of various exploration spacecraft, habitats, or excursion vehicles will reduce exploration life-cycle costs and enhance crew effectiveness by facilitating common usage and maintenance procedures. These metabolic waste management systems must be designed to support system architectures and mission concepts in which wastes are simply collected and contained for disposal or for processing to recover reusable resources, such as water , minerals, or gases. Trash management technologies can substantially reduce the accumulated volume of discarded materials onboard a spacecraft or within a habitat and can stabilize the material to minimize its potential environmental hazard to the crew. In missions where planetary protection safeguards must be adhered to, compacting and inerting trash may be required at levels beyond those required for spacecraft habitation needs. Table 5.

Venting of gas is also a possible disposal means.2015 NASA Technology Roadmaps TA 6: Human Health, Life Support, and Habitation SystemsTA 6 - 30 DRAFTTA 6 .1 .4 Habitation Technical Capability Objectives and Challenges On the ISS, habitation systems include crew quarters, a galley and food systems, hygiene supplies, clothing and linens, and cargo transfer bags. Crew quarters provide a private space for sleep and relaxation. Dehydrated foods and beverages constitute the bulk of crew member dietary intake, supplemented with fresh foods made available from periodic resupply missions. Limited refrigerated and frozen storage is available for foods that are not shelf-stabilized. Laundering of clothing and linens is limited and rudimentary , involving substantial manual effort by crew members. Clothing and linen items contribute substantially to airborne particulate loads that require crew to periodically clean cabin air filters. Cargo transfer bags and packaging materials provide little to no functionality beyond their initial usage for protecting equipment, and are not conducive to efficient inventory management. Habitation objectives include maximizing mass and volume efficiency by developing multi-functional capabilities. For example, volumes dedicated to crew quarters could serve the additional purpose of enabling crew hygiene with the development of liners that protect crew-quarters equipment and prevent the uncontrolled escape of liquid water into other habitable areas. Lightweight, multi-functional cargo transfer bags and packing materials that can be re-purposed for other functions once stored contents are removed could reduce the launch mass of logistics vehicles, as well as internal stowage volumes. Other habitation objectives include reducing ambient noise levels in the cabin by developing quiet fans and adaptive, intelligent noise control systems to enhance crew comfort and well-being. Lint-free, extended-wear clothing, linens, and surface wipes that can be repeatedly laundered by means that are compatible with other onboard life support systems can enhance long-duration missions by reducing launch mass dedicated to clothing, personal hygiene, and general housekeeping, particularly on long-duration missions. Long-duration missions will require that the nutritional stability of food be maintained for periods of up to five years without refrigeration. The ability to efficiently grow fresh vegetables may be required to fully address nutritional needs. Benefits of Technology Multi-functional materials and devices can reduce the mass and volume of equipment and supplies that need to be launched from Earth, and may also be re-purposed to meet needs that might not have been anticipated in mission planning. The internal habitable volume of spacecraft and habitats will likely be at a premium. As such, the innovative, multi-functional use of materials, equipment, and spaces can maximize the level of functionality achievable within very confined habitable volumes. Spacecraft cabins have historically been noisy environments, with acoustic emissions from fans, pumps, and air flowing through ducts and dif fusers impacting crew communication and comfort. These emissions are partially attenuated now by bulky insulation and mufflers. Quiet components, such as fans, would reduce emissions at the source, reducing the need to add mass and volume for attenuating materials. Active, intelligent noise-cancellation technologies could also attenuate the acoustics effect on crew members, particularly as emissions change over time when equipment ages or as crew operations change. Understanding the kinetics of vitamin loss that occurs during food processing and storage and the nutritional content that remains over extended periods of storage will provide the tools necessary to optimize the processing, packaging, and storage of food items needed for multi-year missions. Reliable and efficient food production systems in which fresh vegetables are grown in-situ within a deep-space habitat can provide a nutritionally important supplement to stored foods while also providing a psychological benefit to crew members. Food crops may also provide benefits for carbon dioxide removal, oxygen production, and water purification. Multi-functional lighting systems that provide efficient ambient illumination, aid circadian management, and sustain plant growth may provide multiple benefits.2015 NASA Technology Roadmaps TA 6: Human Health, Life Support, and Habitation SystemsTA 6 - 31 DRAFTTable 6.

Existing suits in operation today are designed for Earth-orbital missions with infrequent and short-duration EVAs in a relatively clean environment. Additionally, a LEA suit provides for crew survivability and occupant protection during contingency and post-landing mission events, and may be used for ascent from and descent to planetary surfaces. A new generation of suits and technologies is required to support national and Agency goals and projected missions over the next few decades, including the development of technologies to extend EVA capability and to be tested on the ISS beyond 2020. An example is the current Modified Advanced Crew Escape Suit (MACES), which is a derivative of LEA suits utilized for Shuttle. The MACES can be enhanced to support short-duration EVA tasks. Another example is the Z-2 suit, which will provide key advances over the first generation Z-1 suit, the most significant being a hard composite upper torso, to provide long-term durability for planetary EVAs. The critical technology needs are those that enable the proposed future missions, due to the difference in the environments, frequency and duration of EVAs, and remote exploration mission locations. Some identified technologies include those that may significantly impact mission implementation (e.g., decreased mass, enhanced mobility, and dust protection) and those that are critical to human safety and well-being (e.g., in-suit waste management). Extravehicular Activity Systems has technologies that crosscut with other areas of TA 6, as well as with other TAs. Within TA 6, the technologies that require maturation to support Portable Life Support System (6.2.2) are also relevant to Air Revitalization (6.1.1), Water Recovery and Management (6.1.2) and Waste Management (6.1.3), albeit on differing level of scale. EVA applications will require additional miniaturization and integration in the suit's form factor. Pressure Garments (6.2.1) will benefit from technology advances in TA 12 Materials, Structure, Mechanical Systems and Manufacturing; similarly , EVA PAS (6.2.3) will benefit from advances in TA 5 Communication, Navigation, and Orbital Debris Tracking and Characterization Systems. Likewise, all of TA 6.2 can benefit from advances made in TA 10 Nanotechnology and several sub-areas of TA 7 Human Exploration Destination Systems. Sub-Goals EVA systems are critical to every foreseeable human exploration mission, from in-space microgravity EVAs in LEO to planetary surface exploration. In addition, a LEA suit system is needed to protect the crew during launch, entry, and landing, and for the potential events of cabin contamination or depressurization. The overarching sub-goal is to develop new suit designs and technologies that are enabling to proposed future missions into the solar system, due to the difference in the environments, frequency and duration of EVAs, and remote exploration mission locations versus current suit systems for Earth orbital missions. MACES is the current LEA suit for the Orion spacecraft2015 NASA Technology Roadmaps TA 6: Human Health, Life Support, and Habitation SystemsTA 6 - 33 DRAFTTable 7.

Summary of Level 6.2 Sub-Goals, Objectives, Challenges, and Benefits - Continued The Z-1 is the state of the art ground test demonstration suitTA 6 .2 .1 Pressure Garment Technical Capability Objectives and Challenges The pressure garment system (PGS) is the set of components (torso, arms, legs, gloves, and helmet) that a crew member wears and uses for operations external to the space vehicle. The PGS also contains provisions to protect crew members from both nominal and off-nominal conditions during launch, entry, and landing. The current Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) on the ISS has a PGS design and associated components for orbital, short-duration EVAs in a relatively clean environment. The Advanced Crew Escape Suit (ACES) was the LEA suit used for the Space Shuttle, but it was not designed with adequate mobility to support EVA tasks. Future suits require a PGS that can accommodate new environments such as Mars' and advanced mission operations (pressurized don or doff). Other PGS advancements include advanced and multi-functional suit materials and fabrication techniques; suit configurations and architectures with decreased mass; components with increased capability (e.g., mobility); sizing to accommodate a wide range of crew members; dust-resistance technologies; and increased durability or life. Advances in the pressure garment for future spacesuits are sought to allow efficient donning or doffing, enable long-duration and high-performance suited operations in both space and planetary environs, provide scaling across a range of anthropometric sizes, and provide crew support, such as safe in-suit waste management and provision of water. The majority of these technological advances and an overall new suit design(s) are needed to support near-term design reference missions (DRMs) (e.g., EM-2, DRM 5) and for testing aboard the ISS in a relevant space environment, including microgravity and radiation. For those technologies identified for test or demonstration on the ISS, the need date for integration into a prototype and operational suit is as early as 2021, but no later than 2023 (prior to the end of operations on the ISS in 2024). Numerous technical challenges exist for the PGS. For future missions, one challenge is to provide donning or doffing suits up to approximately 9 pounds per square inch differential (psid) while maintaining other features of pressure suits (low mass, sizing, long-life, mobility , and 2015 NASA Technology Roadmaps TA 6: Human Health, Life Support, and Habitation SystemsTA 6 - 35 DRAFTenvironmental protection).This capability does not currently exist, as all suits to date have been or are donned or doffed at cabin pressure. Also, to support future suit design and implementation, quantified structural suit stresses in different loading conditions (e.g., satellite capture or picking up a rock) are needed, including the effects of crew. Additionally, future suits must be capable of fitting an occupant per NASA-STD-3001, NASA Space Flight Human-System Standard. As stated in Volume 2, Space Flight Human-System Standard, \"each program shall identify or develop an anthropometry, biomechanics, aerobic capacity, and strength data set for the crew member population to be accommodated.\" While program requirements may vary based on the mission and other pertinent requirements or constraints, the current practice is to design to the fifth to 95th percentile American in any or all of the critical dimensions. Future exploration-class suits should incorporate new and innovative technologies for human-centered design to meet challenges like requiring no more than 10 percent of an individual's strength to articulate the suit. Future missions will also include gravitational environments and mission limitations for overall vehicle or systems mass; for future suits, a significant reduction in mass is needed (i.e., less than 100 pounds total mass). Managing in-suit waste poses significant challenges to preclude human waste leakage, allow for extended days in suit (vehicle contingency) without causing occupant injury or death, and increase the capacity of the SOA for both liquid and solid content. Advances are required for the PGS material layup for both space and planet environments, and can include material exposure to dust, abrasion, punctures, cuts, hypervelocity impacts (micrometeoroids and secondary ejecta), plasma and shock, general vehicle materials compatibility (such as ammonia), and Mars thermal environment (including seasonal variation), without compromising existing suit mobility. New suit materials should continually be identified, evaluated in coupon-level testing, and integrated into the suit PGS and components. Game-changing advances would include materials that combine two or more of the following functions: power generation, heat rejection, communication, dust protection, injury protection, reduced risk of electrical shock hazards (e.g., due to plasma charging), radiation protection, fire protection, and enhanced crew survivability. Other advances should address limitations in current helmets by providing permanent anti-fogging, being durable (anti-scratch), and providing visor assemblies (to allow change-out when damage does occur). Advancements necessary for an exploration-class glove include mobility of the complete assembly, reduced injury potential during use, reduced system mass, increased thermal operational range, and increased life in the lunar or Martian dirt environment. Also needed for future missions is a long-life, high-use, reusable in-suit drink or nutrition bag. Future suits should also incorporate automatically activated distress and geo-locating systems. Benefits of Technology Advancements in suit technologies is enabling to all planned future missions. Specific benefits include the ability to perform unassisted pressurized don or doff for future space vehicle architectures (e.g., suitport - which is discussed in TA 7.3); the ability to change out components; long-duration performance with durability (e.g., in-suit waste management, dust); significant mass reduction over the current EMU with increased capability (e.g., abrasion resistance, self-healing); the ability to perform frequent EV As to support mission needs without extensive servicing, maintenance, or need for ground support; improvements in crew comfort, sizing, and fit level; and ease of use.

TA 6 .2 .2 Portable Life Support System Table 8. TA 6.2.1 Technology Candidates - not in priority order - Continued Technical Capability Objectives and Challenges The PLSS is used with EV A suits to perform functions required to keep a crew member alive during an excursion from the space vehicle. The functions include maintaining thermal control of the crew member, providing a pressurized oxygen environment, and removing products of metabolic output, such as carbon dioxide, water, trace contaminants, and heat. Advancements in the PLSS are necessary to enable future missions, such as to planetary environments. An example is the sublimator currently utilized as a part of the ISS EMU to reject heat (metabolic heat plus system-generated heat); it sublimates water and the vapor is released into space. Sublimation is a physical mechanism requiring a hard vacuum environment, and thus cannot be used for Mars surface missions. Another example is the current ISS EMU, which uses either a lithium hydroxide (LiOH) or silver oxide (MetOx) single-sorbent bed to absorb CO 2 during an EVA. The LiOH is relatively light but not reusable and therefore has a significant logistical and system mass impact for longer missions. The MetOx is regenerable between EVAs but has a mass greater than 18 kilograms (kg) when scaled for surface exploration metabolic loading, and also requires significant power and vehicle space for the hardware used for regeneration. For Mars missions, the PLSS design will be pursued as closed-loop to function in the Mars atmosphere and be compliant with planetary protection guidelines and policy. 2015 NASA Technology Roadmaps TA 6: Human Health, Life Support, and Habitation SystemsTA 6 - 37 DRAFTThe PLSS is a prime candidate for infusion of new technologies to significantly reduce or eliminate consumables, improve reliability, and increase crew performance. Significant (order of magnitude) increase in heat rejection performance and provision for closed-loop operations (no venting to environment) are some key advances that would enable future missions. For most technological advances and for an overall new suit design, the objective is to test aboard the ISS in a relevant space environment. This drives a need date for the technologies integrated into a prototype suit no later than 2023, to allow testing prior to the end of the ISS program in 2024. Technical challenges for the PLSS include the development of hardware that can reject heat in a Martian atmosphere while fitting within a small enough mass and volume box to be carried by an astronaut. Radiator approaches seem to hold the most promise, but a radiator must allow adjustment of the heat removal rate, without penalty against other parameters compared to the SOA. The radiator would also need to be dust tolerant (degradation of emissivity) and impact tolerant (for example, falling or hitting a rock). In addition, developing closed-loop CO 2 removal is necessary if stringent planetary protection requirements are implemented. Current technology requires a separate large oven, which would have a large impact on pressurized mobile assets. For in-suit atmospheric constituent sensors, three different technology approaches exist at this time, each with their own challenges: Nondispersive Infrared (NDIR), phase-resolved luminescence, and wavelength modulation spectroscopy. Two of them are sensitive to liquid water and the other is at a low Technology Readiness Level (TRL). Suits will also need accurate pressure sensors, and the increased accuracy can be obtained from precision-matched resistors and active compensation circuits. However , this approach draws more power, increases the size, and makes the sensor more susceptible to radiation ef fects. Using an alternate sorbent is highly desirable for suit life support, but obtaining a sorbent that has the affinity to adsorb compounds at trace levels without adding considerable energy release, and then releasing those compounds with a relatively minor pressure swing to vacuum is a challenge. Another example sorbent technology is the amine swingbed, which can meet many of the functional requirements but also releases ammonia (NH 3) into the ventilation loop and concentrates it during storage periods. Another suit challenge is to improve on the CO2 and H2O membrane technologies, but early versions require heating to high temperatures, which in an EVA application would be prohibitive from a power perspective and would increase the flammability risk from an oxygen compatibility perspective. Optimizing PLSS components, such as the fan, is also sought. Current centrifugal blower designs achieve high aero efficiency but with very tight tolerances (< 0.003 inch (in.)) and high shaft speeds (over 20 thousand revolutions per minute (krpm+)). Advanced technology would seek to open the tolerances and increase the head-rise, while lowering the shaft speed and keeping the volume approximately the same as the current technology . Benefits of Technology A benefit of advancing suit technologies is that advanced regenerable technologies for removing moisture and CO 2 from the suit lead to reduced consumables and mass. In addition, the ability to capture CO2 and moisture from the suit and deliver them back to the vehicle without incurring significant mass, volume, or power penalties would help close the loop for water and oxygen on a mission level. Non-venting heat rejection technologies would lead to significant reduction in mission consumables as well. Compact, low-mass, reliable, and efficient technologies and advanced suit components need to be developed to enable heat rejection to the spectrum of thermal environments and ensure crew performance for the expected exploration missions.

Current space suits are equipped with radio transmitters and receivers so that spacewalking astronauts can talk with ground controllers and other astronauts. The astronauts wear headsets with microphones and earphones. The transmitters and receivers are located in the backpacks worn by the astronauts and operate only in the ultra-high frequency (UHF) band. Advances in PAS technologies can dramatically increase capabilities over the SOA. Examples include advances in radio and avionics technologies, such as antennas, member information displays; and technologies that provide improvements in speech quality, auditory quality, and listening effort for in-helmet vocal communications. Another advancement would be a radio with networking capabilities and data rates that support the transmission of high-definition (HD) video. Integrating components like speakers and microphones into the suit will improve crew comfort and the reliability of the communications system. Also, dramatic increases in the specific energy of future suit power systems are needed. Similar to the PLSS, these advances should be tested aboard the ISS in a relevant space environment, especially for radiation-hardened components. For those technologies identified for test or demonstration on the ISS, a need date for integration into a prototype and operational suit is as early as 2021, but no later than 2023 (prior to the end of operations on the ISS in 2024). Also needed are technologies for space field geology, which has not been conducted since the Apollo missions. An example would be where the EVA informatics system would record suited-crew position relative to a known point (such as a rover); record audio (such as spoken field notes), record HD video from a camera to mark the position of the geological sample, and provide real-time access to the astronaut to review findings while still conducting the EVA. Only analog space missions are currently active in this field and are limited to standard Earth-based techniques (e.g., manual logging and photography), which cannot support future missions. Advanced EVA informatics (to include field geology) and other advanced suit PAS should be in place by 2027 to be viable for implementation on planetary exploration missions. For PAS, key hardware constraints include mass, power, volume, and performance of existing radiation- hardened electronics. The primary challenge for suit battery packages is improved power density (100 percent increase). Lithium ion cells do not have adequate power density to meet the needs of future portable life support systems. One primary focus for radio systems is improving the interface between the crew member , the acoustic pickup (microphones), and communications and generation (speaker) systems. Benefits of Technology For suit radio and audio systems, integrating speakers and microphones into the suit will improve crew comfort as well as the reliability of the communications system. Information systems and displays have tremendous possibilities for improving crew autonomy and efficiency and advancing the SOA. An integrated sensor suite that includes crew-health diagnostics, coupled with advanced informatics, speech recognition, voice commanding, computing, and display systems, can offer a wealth of information on crew state, external environment, mission tasks, and other mission-critical information to maximize crew performance and safety . Advanced batteries can support long-duration EVAs with minimal servicing or maintenance. 2015 NASA Technology Roadmaps TA 6: Human Health, Life Support, and Habitation SystemsTA 6 - 40 DRAFTTable 10.

Equally important to the crew's physical health is their behavioral health and their ability to function effectively throughout the mission and upon their return to Earth. Advanced \"omics\" technologies, which screen astronaut candidates to ascertain their susceptibility to various effects of space missions, could be used to recruit the astronaut corps. Sophisticated methodologies could be used to select a team for a particular mission. Additionally, personalized prescriptions (pharmaceutical, exercise, sensorimotor, psychological, etc.) could be developed and implemented during the mission. The physical and mental health of crew members should be optimal to maximize performance throughout the mission. Based on the personalized rehabilitation regimens, long-term physical and mental health of the crew members can be achieved. If environmental conditions can compromise the physical and mental health of the crew, the performance of the crew will be suboptimal. This requires the design and maintenance of operational environments and scenarios that support appropriate life and work behaviors (e.g., restful sleep, reasonable stress and workload levels), as well as a safe and efficient environment (i.e., human-centered tools and automation; adequate space for privacy and crew cooperation). Additionally, it is important to understand human health and performance in the exploration atmosphere (8.2 psi/34 percent oxygen, microgravity , elevated carbon dioxide), since the effects of the exploration atmosphere could drive countermeasure procedures, protocols, and technologies. Human-centered design of onboard systems with effective interfaces and information architectures is critical for mission success. Appropriate allocation of tasks, coupled with proper integration of humans with automation and robotics, will minimize errors and maximize efficiency. Training technologies that support initial, recurrent, and just-in-time instruction will ensure that crew members can apply the proper knowledge and skills to both nominal and off-nominal situations. These technologies will prove increasingly critical as mission durations and distances from Earth increase, since the crews will be required to function without timely support from Earth. Technologies for Human Health and Performance (TA 6.3) crosscut with other areas in TA 6, as well as with other TAs. Within TA 6, the technologies that require maturation to support Medical Diagnosis and Prognosis (6.3.1) and Long-Duration Health (6.3.2) are also relevant to Radiation Monitoring Technology (6.5.5) and Risk Assessment Modeling (6.5.1). Tools for monitoring cognitive state, as well as training technologies developed for behavioral health (6.3.3) can be leveraged to support long-duration mission needs for human factors (6.3.4). Human Factors (6.3.4) will also benefit from and contribute to advances within TA 4 Robotics and Autonomous Systems, especially with regards to ensuring effective teaming of humans with automation and robots. Sub-Goals Future human spaceflight exploration objectives will present significant new challenges to crew health, including hazards created by traversing the terrain of planetary surfaces during exploration and the physiological effects of variable-gravity environments. The limited communications with ground-based personnel for diagnosis and consultation of medical events will create additional challenges. Providing healthcare capabilities for exploration missions will require definition of new medical requirements and development of technologies. These capabilities will help to ensure exploration crew health and mission safety and success before, during, and after flight.2015 NASA Technology Roadmaps TA 6: Human Health, Life Support, and Habitation SystemsTA 6 - 42 DRAFTTable 11.

Ef forts have been made to develop and select technologies to screen, diagnose, and treat these medical conditions, as well as provide efficient infrastructure support for a particular level of care. In large part, NASA relies on commercial medical hardware and practices to screen, diagnose, and treat medical conditions. However , these technologies are often incompatible with microgravity, primarily because they depend on gravity in order to operate, resulting in altered performance in space. Additionally, resource constraints (mass, volume, and power; limited resupply; lack of refrigeration and limited training time) and logistical concerns often complicate and constrain the efficient use of devices in microgravity. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), Fundoscope, ultrasound, and Tonometer are currently available onboard the ISS to measure the eye structure and function of crew members in a microgravity environment. The vision impairment noted during space missions is potentially due to elevation of Intracranial Pressure (ICP), sodium ion intake through food, and higher carbon dioxide levels in the habitable environment. Developing an effective countermeasure to minimize this vision impairment during space mission is one of the challenges of this TA. The current ultrasound imaging platform on the ISS will be enhanced with additional infrared and other fluorescence-based image modalities. For long-term missions, the approach to address microgravity- induced physiological challenges and isolation-induced performance issues will be radically different compared to LEO missions. Astronaut corps selection, followed by selection of the team for long-term missions, could be addressed based on personalized medicine principles. Vision impairment, along with susceptibility to radiation-induced issues, will be addressed at the molecular and cellular levels compared to the current treatment mode. Behavioral changes during the long-term mission will be monitored continuously and an appropriate treatment plan will be in place. The human-centered design of the vehicle, coupled with sophisticated just-in-time training and appropriate environmental conditions, will enhance the performance of the human during these missions. LEO missions have a viable evacuation strategy that can provide definitive medical care within hours. Exploration DRMs, however, do not have near-real-time communications or an evacuation capability. In exploration missions, we need to fly more medical hardware and increase crew training so that they may operate independently for longer periods of time. Benefits of Technology A number of proposed technologies align with today's Medical Prognosis Team items and can be transitioned to medical practice once they have been fully validated. Screening technologies that are designed to recruit, train, and rehabilitate crew members could be used for many challenging mission assignments. Enriched oxygen generators, generation of medical-grade water, miniaturized imaging technologies, and biosample analytical methodologies could be used in home healthcare and remote conditions, such as rural, battlefield, and wilderness medicine. Inherent features of NASA technology\u2014miniaturization, ease of use, reusability, and autonomy\u2014are well-suited for the abovementioned terrestrial conditions. In addition to analysis of biological samples, in-flight imaging is another method to monitor crew health and provide real-time diagnostic data for researchers and flight surgeons. Technologies that need a minimum amount of biological samples should also be developed. Non-invasive enabling technology is required to An astronaut onboard the ISS checks her vision using an innovative medical diagnostic device2015 NASA Technology Roadmaps TA 6: Human Health, Life Support, and Habitation SystemsTA 6 - 44 DRAFTguide studies aimed at accurately assessing bone structure, muscle mass, cardiovascular function, and vision changes, as well as diagnosing musculoskeletal and soft tissue injuries or other medical conditions. Currently on the ISS, Office of the Chief Technologist, Tonometer, and ultrasound are available, along with Fundoscope to assess and treat vision impairment. These devices are onboard the ISS to measure ocular structure and function (e.g., intraocular pressure, fundus imaging, optic nerve sheath and ocular morphology imaging), along with AcuityPro software to measure visual acuity. A two-dimensional (2D) ultrasound unit is also onboard the ISS to assess crew health. Non-ionizing, full-body , dynamic, three-dimensional (3D) imaging for in-situ physiological monitoring, diagnosis, and treatment should be in place for future missions. Potential technologies include Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), ultrasound, Raman, and near infrared (NIR) to enhance the current capabilities. Miniaturization and integration with other diagnostic or in-flight analysis tools is highly desired. Minimally invasive diagnostic sensor suites that can be donned or dof fed are being developed. While addressing the potential medical conditions that might require spaceflight surgery , development in the area of sterile, closed-loop fluid and ventilations systems for trauma and other surgeries are being explored.

The platform must also exhibit expanded assay capability; extended shelf-life of consumables (e.g. reagents, cartridges); minimize mass, volume, power, consumables; and provide sample containment. 6.3.1.4 StethoscopeThe next-generation stethoscope will enable medical and non-medical personnel to listen to internal auscultation sounds that are generated by the body in a noisy environment. 6.3.1.5 Sterile Fluid Generation DeviceThe intravenous (IV) fluid delivery system will enable the generation of sterile fluid from an exploration vehicle's existing potable water supply. 6.3.1.6Radiofrequency Identification (RFID)-Based Medical Inventory Tracking Hardware and SoftwareA medical inventory capability, such as the Medical Consumable Tracking (MCT) system, will use RFID technology to electronically track consumable contents within a medical kit. 6.3.1.7Suite of Medication Packaging OptionsThe medication packaging materials and design will preserve stability and shelf life during long-duration exploration missions with limited re-supply capability. 6.3.1.8 Medical Equipment SterilizationThe system will enable sterilization of medical equipment that is to be used more than once on an exploration mission. 6.3.1.9Integrated Medical Equipment and Software SuiteDevelopment of a data architecture to efficiently manage crew health and human performance data generated in support of an exploration mission will fill this gap. The ideal architecture will enable plug-and-play connectivity, automate routine data management tasks, and allow for future expansion of the system.2015 NASA Technology Roadmaps TA 6: Human Health, Life Support, and Habitation SystemsTA 6 - 45 DRAFTTA 6 .3 .2 Long-Duration Health Technical Capability Objectives and Challenges Ongoing progress made in the fields of genomics, physiomics, transcriptomics, intracellular Nanobots for diagnosis and treatment, materials, and other relevant technologies will significantly enhance our ability to address the medical needs of the human system. Measuring in-flight changes in bone mass and structure over the course of ISS missions is important. Increased understanding of the effects of spaceflight on bone (particularly of hip and spine) will improve the probabilistic assessment of fracture risk during long-term missions. Challenges associated with providing for long-duration health include providing a system that combines both resistive and cardiovascular exercise, providing vibration isolation and stabilization systems, developing monitoring capabilities that can be used for long-term missions, ensuring the stability of pharmaceuticals, and improving the shelf life of consumables used for biosample analysis. Additionally, providing crew members with a multi-spectral, controllable suite that enables quality sleep is also a challenge, but is critical to the long-term health of crew . The countermeasures that are used consistently to date in the U.S. human space program are fluid loading, compression garment or antigravity suit for orthostatic intolerance, physical exercise to counteract the skeletal muscle atrophy and loss of muscle strength and endurance that is associated with microgravity exposure. Other crosscutting technologies provide significant value to other discipline teams - one example is artificial gravity (AG), which is seen as a potential game-changing technology. Aside from being a promising countermeasure for many body systems, AG development would require a new approach to vehicle design and potentially revolutionize the way we explore space. AG may reduce requirements for other countermeasures and reconditioning after spaceflight. AG alone or in combination with another countermeasure can be used to combat multiple-system deconditioning of bone, muscle, cardiovascular, sensorimotor, and other physiological systems. The biggest challenge for developing and assessing the efficacy of AG is the lack of a baseline or reference mission design and architecture to compare and contrast solutions for implementation (e.g., hyper- vs. hypo-gravity , exposure prescription), along with quantifying the health impacts. Other needed capabilities include understanding the effects of microgravity and radiation on human systems, as will be ascertained using model systems (Biosentinels) such as cells, 3D tissue, micro-organisms, and small animals. Induced pluripotent stem cells could be used to generate individualized treatments for astronauts on long-duration missions. These model systems should be evaluated using robotic precursor missions with platforms (including altered-gravity capabilities) at the ISS, free-flyer-hosted payloads including micro- and nano-satellites (Edison), and commercial or international collaborative missions like Bions. Advanced exercise equipment and methods, which also meet mass, volume, and other constraints, are needed to support extended missions beyond LEO to maintain crew fitness levels. Several exercise countermeasures are currently deployed on the ISS: the Combined Operational Load Bearing External Resistive Treadmill (COLBERT), Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED), and cyclic ergometer. Current exercise prescriptions using rack-mounted hardware consume large amounts of space and stowage in the vehicle. In addition, both the treadmill and cycle ergometer require power levels that may not be available in new vehicles. A pharmaceutical countermeasure against spaceflight-induced bone loss is also in place. For future exploration missions, low-power and more reliable, robust equipment; a monitoring capability; and a vibration isolation An astronaut onboard the ISS exercises to prevent the physiological effects of long-duration spaceflight2015 NASA Technology Roadmaps TA 6: Human Health, Life Support, and Habitation SystemsTA 6 - 46 DRAFTsystem (VIS) that can be easily deployed and adjusted to various gravitational environments. Additionally, robust, efficacious, and validated nutritional, radio-protective, and pharmacological countermeasures should be geared towards various physiological systems affected by spaceflight environment. With the inability for rapid return to Earth, other required technologies including lab-on-a-chip are needed to prevent and address crew injury and physiological changes such as for predicted visual changes, immune compromise and the possibility of decompression sickness. Quality sleep and circadian management will also be essential to crew health. Overall nutrition or consumables and monitoring technologies, such as pharmaceuticals and technology for detection of microbes in water and on surfaces are also essential for ensuring crew health and preventing illness. A primary challenge is that most of the aforementioned technologies do not yet exist, and should be developed and tested in a space environment (e.g., on the ISS) prior to being employed on a long-duration mission. Monitoring technologies are needed to assess the degree of bone and muscle loss during the mission and customize countermeasures needed for the crew . In-flight research is essential to understand in \"real time\" the ef fects of long-duration spaceflight and develop countermeasures. As exploration missions increase in duration and distance beyond our present experience, it will be necessary to monitor crew health and provide real-time diagnostic data for researchers and flight surgeons. Preservation and return of biological samples for analysis on Earth will become increasingly difficult due to vehicle stowage constraints and refrigeration requirements. Currently , portable clinical blood analyzers with limited analysis capabilities are used, and samples are preserved and returned to Earth for later analysis. Consequently, most results are only available well after flight crews return. In the future, instruments will analyze biological fluids (e.g., blood, urine, saliva, sweat) in-flight and provide real-time feedback on crew health. Assays for complete blood count with white blood cell differential, blood gases, metabolic panel, cardiac panel, liver panel, urinalysis, and biomarkers of stress, fatigue, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage, bone loss, and numerous other analytes will be assessed. Assays to detect pathogenic bacteria and viruses are also needed. Benefits of Technology Developing a benchmark for the requisite level of crew strength and endurance is required to accomplish future long-duration mission objectives. Once this benchmark is developed, specialized exercise hardware and a safe exercise regimen with equivalent or improved benefits that reduce the time dedicated to daily physical exercise could be created. Early development of countermeasure technologies will be essential to maintain the crew' s health. Critical biomedical technologies include on-orbit bioanalysis, lab-on-a-chip and other diagnostic capabilities, cell and animal models (biosentinels), advanced imaging, and countermeasures like artificial gravity (AG). Integrating individual devices into hand-held, in-flight, reportable units with increased capability and reduced mass, volume, and power is necessary for feasible implementation of these technologies in the smaller vehicles, expected to be used for more advanced missions. These technologies are being developed and validated on the ISS. The lab-on-a-chip technologies developed for assessing real time crew health can be used for bed-side monitoring under terrestrial conditions. Table 13.

The suite could include heart rate and blood pressure monitoring and electrocardiogram.

TA 6 .3 .3 Behavioral Health Technical Capability Objectives and Challenges NASA currently employs a number of countermeasures to support crew behavioral health and performance during short- to mid-length missions in LEO. As we expand our mission durations and distance from Earth, it will be necessary to expand the capabilities of this support, which currently relies on close proximity to Earth. In particular, countermeasures to ensure astronauts maintain adequate team cohesion, cooperation, and communication are needed, as are means to keep the crew connected to family and friends on Earth. Likewise, measures to ensure crew obtain adequate sleep, rest, and recreation; maintain cognitive function; and balance stress and workload levels are also needed. Current approaches to prevent behavioral conditions and psychiatric disorders begin during crew selection and continue post-flight. The objective of the behavioral health component of the astronaut selection process is to identify individuals who, at the time of application, have diagnoses that are incompatible with the demands of spaceflight, and then further identify those who are believed to be best suited, psychologically , to be astronauts. Countermeasures are a second line of defense to prevent behavioral conditions and psychiatric disorders from occurring pre-flight, during flight, and post-flight. For example, psychological support services are provided to crew members and their families before, during, and after missions. Selection, training, and countermeasures will still apply to future missions. However , desired technologies to support the more highly autonomous, highly confined exploration ventures should be feasible in spaceflight, have high user acceptability, be individualized (where applicable), and provide real-time feedback to crew members. The challenge is to be minimally invasive while remaining sensitive to changes over time. An example of needed technology is one that brings together unobtrusive measures of the sleep and wake cycle, associated crew performance, and possible environmental stressors, to provide further context to the behavioral health and performance of the crew.2015 NASA Technology Roadmaps TA 6: Human Health, Life Support, and Habitation SystemsTA 6 - 48 DRAFTMissions beyond LEO will pose significant challenges to astronauts' psychological health, due to confined living quarters, delayed communications, no view of Earth, and separation from loved ones, among other factors. Potential deleterious outcomes associated with these risk factors increase as mission duration extends beyond six months; nonetheless, some missions may last up to three years. Additional technologies are needed to identify, characterize, and prevent or reduce risks associated with space travel, exploration, and return to terrestrial life on astronauts' behavioral health and performance. Unobtrusive measures and technologies will provide the ability to detect when countermeasures may be needed. Technologies will yield preventative countermeasures as well, such as virtual worlds for sensory stimulation and connection to family and friends back home; just-in-time training to facilitate team coordination and skills throughout the mission; and dynamic lighting systems to support a day-night cycle for optimal physiological and psychological health. Benefits of Technology Currently in spaceflight, multiple methods are employed to prevent an adverse behavioral condition. While systematic data collection is lacking, anecdotal reports indicate that overall, crew member behavioral health and performance is maintained throughout six-month missions to LEO. However , future exploration missions will pose unique stressors and challenges. Identifying individual, team, and environmental factors that increase the likelihood and consequence of adverse outcomes will improve the efficacy of prevention and treatment in missions to come. Known contributors to performance decrements, adverse behavioral conditions, or psychiatric disorders include sleep and circadian disruption, conflict, lack of autonomy , daily personal irritants, workload, fatigue, monotony, cultural and organizational factors, family and interpersonal issues, and environmental factors, such as confined spaces, poor lighting, noise control, and CO 2 levels.

Whereas these \"tried and true\" operations have functioned reliably for LEO missions (e.g., Shuttle and the ISS), this design paradigm will not extend gracefully to next-generation exploration missions. Instead, NASA will require human-systems technologies that afford the crew a higher level of autonomous function, including far better integration with onboard automation. Less ground-based support will also necessitate improved onboard training and decision-support tools, including systems that support recurrent or refresher and just-in-time training for both nominal and off-nominal operational events. The primary objective of Human Factors is for human space exploration to preserve the safety of the crew , promote human performance, and increase efficiency during all phases of the mission. This objective is achieved by integrating human factors principles into the environmental and architectural design of hardware, software, vehicles, and habitats. In particular, effective on-orbit environmental conditions and architectural design are critical for the health and well-being of crew members, as well as the habitability of vehicles and habitats. Optimized usability in the design of workspaces, equipment, and tools for the remote spaceflight environment is also important. Many human performance errors that have been experienced in long-duration spaceflight have been directly related to poor system and task design. Poor task design results from a lack of integration and consideration of the human throughout the operational process. The human-system interface and tasks that require human involvement must be designed to elicit appropriate inputs from the operator . If the roles and responsibilities for accomplishing tasks are not clearly defined, there will be a risk of serious errors of omission or commission. This risk may relate to interactions among multiple crew members, interactions between crew and robotics, and between crew and ground control personnel. Evidence for the risk that is associated with poor task design is related to both human and automated tasks. Although operator errors are common in all work environments, task errors that occur during human spaceflight missions could have drastic consequences. Errors can be due to inadequate information, which, in turn, may be caused by: a) a lack of situational awareness that can result from poorly-designed interfaces, poorly-designed tasks, or cognitive decrements caused by, for example, fatigue or exposure to toxic environments; b) forgetting, which can result from inadequate training, poorly-designed procedures, or cognitive decrements; c) an inability to access appropriate data and procedures, which can result from poorly-designed interfaces, poorly-designed tasks, or cognitive decrements; and d) a failure of judgment, which can result from incorrectly perceiving or interpreting cues, inappropriately estimating results of decisions, or inadequate data. Effective performance by the crew is dependent upon advanced user interface concepts, including task-tuned displays and controls, smart habitats and human-robotic interaction, and interactive visualization technologies to increase the capacity, usability, and reliability of information transfer. Human-systems integration (HSI) standards, methods, and tools should be implemented. These include the HSI scorecard (for human factors requirements and processes assessment for human-rating the spacecraft), the Maneuverability Assessment Scale (for real-time data collection), and the System Consistency Scale (for hardware and software design assessment).2015 NASA Technology Roadmaps TA 6: Human Health, Life Support, and Habitation SystemsTA 6 - 50 DRAFTRobust training technologies, enabling both pre-flight and in-flight training methods and tools are critical, especially for long-duration missions with communication delays. A long-duration mission habitat and workstation design that encompasses enhanced tools for assessing habitability impact to ensure crew' s health and performance and anthropometric consideration for human capabilities is required. It is important to develop improved human-computer and robotic interfaces to ensure safety and productivity . Benefits of Technology A successful human spaceflight program depends heavily on the crew's ability to interact effectively, reliably, and safely with their environments. The Human Factors area represents a commitment to developing effective, efficient, usable, adaptable, and evolvable systems to achieve mission success, based on increased understanding of human performance (perception, cognition, action) and human capabilities and constraints in the operational context.

The modeling should be based on sound ergonomic principles. 6.3.4.9 Physical AccommodationTechniques to ensure crew in EVA suits can safely perform diverse tasks. Proper and adequate accommodation of suited crew in a safe manner is a necessary requirement to ensure new and existing space hardware is designed effectively.2015 NASA Technology Roadmaps TA 6: Human Health, Life Support, and Habitation SystemsTA 6 - 51 DRAFTTA 6.4: Environmental Monitoring, Safety, and Emergency Response A primary requirement for manned spaceflight is the generation and maintenance of a safe environment in the habitable volume of the spacecraft. To meet such a requirement, technology is needed to assess and manage the risks to environmental health during the mission. In manned spaceflight, risks can arise from degradation or loss of active controls, combustion events, leaks from system or payload equipment, and crew activities or actions, such as EVAs, personal hygiene, housekeeping, payload operations, and normal metabolism (for example, the generation of CO 2). As such, these risks not only affect crew health, but they can also affect the ECLSS within the vehicle, which were designed to generate an environment suitable for sustaining human life. Monitoring data confirms the performance of ECLSS technologies and manages potential crew health risks. Environmental monitoring data is used to manage acute crew health problems associated with contamination events that may result in exposures; to make more informed assessments of crew-reported symptoms and potential links to contaminant exposure and/or cabin environmental observations; and to guide crew actions and successful recovery during off-nominal environmental problems. In addition, monitoring can provide early warning of off-nominal situations where controls degrade or fail, necessary data to assist in correcting failures and determining their root cause, and data on a variety of toxicological compounds and environmental factors that may have specific crew health impacts. Technologies in the Environmental Monitoring, Safety, and Emergency Response area (6.4) crosscut with other sub-areas in TA 6, as well as with other TAs. Within TA 6, the technologies that require maturation to support EVA Systems (6.2) may contribute to Protective Clothing and Breathing (6.4.3). There may be opportunities for synergistic technology development between Air Revitalization (6.1.1) and the more acute demands of environmental Remediation (6.4.4). Similar synergies may exist between Air Revitalization (6.1.1), Water Recovery and Management (6.1.3), and Sensors: Air, Water, Microbial, and Acoustic (6.4.1). The 6.4.1 area will likely benefit from advances made in TA 10 Nanotechnology, as well. Sub-Goals The sub-goals of environmental monitoring, safety, and emergency response are to develop technologies that ensure crew health and safety by protecting against spacecraft hazards, and for ef fective response should an accident occur. The two major technology sub-goals for environmental monitoring are the monitoring of microorganisms and microbial identification and enumeration and advance water analysis with speciation (inorganic and organic species). Microbial characterization and comprehensive water analysis for the ISS have relied on sample returns and subsequent ground analysis. Despite logistics issues and costs, manned missions within LEO have the option for sample return, whereas long-duration missions well beyond LEO do not. This limit on sample return for missions beyond LEO drives the need for technology that can provide more information in-flight than what current water and microbial monitoring provides. Increasing the degree of autonomy is also needed. By automating the routine operations and procedures, requirements for crew time can be reduced significantly. Ground commanding of systems is already possible. Systems can also be configured to automatically operate at predefined intervals and perform data analysis. However, further developments in automation to decrease over-reliance on ground support to verify in-flight results using sample returns and ground analysis is required. In-flight validation protocols to ensure proper instrument functionality and data integrity are quite limited with current monitoring hardware. A limited degree of data validation is usually accomplished through redundancy and comparison to ground analyses. (Ground support may be present, albeit in a limited manner, but a great degree of autonomy is required as missions travel farther from LEO.) 2015 NASA Technology Roadmaps TA 6: Human Health, Life Support, and Habitation SystemsTA 6 - 52 DRAFTThe typically physical characteristics imposed by any mission vehicle used beyond LEO apply to all environmental monitoring hardware as well. All hardware must be small in size and volume, have low power requirements, have little to no consumables, and properly sample the environment. Multi-functional hardware can be desirable, but further assessment may be required since the loss of hardware can potentially translate into the loss capabilities. Table 16.

Most of the SOA provides simple indications of the state of the environment onboard the vehicle. Many ground-based laboratory technologies are assisted by gravity and as such, is not readily translated into in-flight monitoring. Relatively simple and robust monitoring technology is required to provide crew with information to properly manage the vehicle environment during the mission. The primary limitation with the SOA is reliance on sample return, ground analysis, and ground support. Hardware onboard the manned vehicle should provide sufficient information for real-time, operational decisions. Other limitations include reliance on resupply of consumables. Contributing to this is limited calibration and battery life of the SOA. The need to reduce crew-time is also a limitation. Tasks as simple as checking calibration, changing batteries, and sampling surfaces with a cotton swab would take a few minutes when performed on the ground, but may take up to an hour in flight. Increasing the reliability of monitoring hardware will address these challenges. The focus of this area is to provide future spacecraft with advanced sensors capable of monitoring environmental health and accurately determining and controlling the physical, chemical, biological, and acoustic environments of crew living areas and their environmental control systems. Existing technologies will not meet the needs of future exploration for LEO and beyond, for which logistical resupply will be impractical and mission lengths will be far greater, necessitating greater independence from Earth. Crew time spent monitoring and controlling the spacecraft environment must be reduced. Related technologies in physical, chemical, biological, and acoustic monitoring and advanced control must be assembled and be tied synergistically to provide necessary technologies for future human space exploration. The focus will also be on adapting readily-available technology for reliable, long-term operation in the space environment and on meeting the constraints imposed by the vehicle without sacrificing capability. In some cases, NASA-unique needs will require unique solutions. Challenges in the sensor area may be met by a combination of technologies. Analytical techniques that have been demonstrated aboard the ISS, such as Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR), differential mobility spectrometry (DMS), and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) can serve as the basis for environmental monitoring instrumentation. Combinations of these analytical techniques can create a single 'suite' of sensors applicable to atmospheric and water quality monitoring. Properly designed sample preparation and inlet devices can enable monitoring of multiple gas- and liquid-phase targets with the 'suite' of sensors. Additional sample processing stages may enable microbial monitoring as well. Microbial monitors and sensors should be able to distinguish the presence of undesirable microbes against a background of benign, or even essential, organisms. In all cases, needs for manned spaceflight are more constraining than terrestrial needs. This is true not only in terms of An astronaut works on the Major Constituent Analyzer (MCA) in Node 3 of the ISS An astronaut installs a total organic carbon analyzer in the U .S . lab of the ISS2015 NASA Technology Roadmaps TA 6: Human Health, Life Support, and Habitation SystemsTA 6 - 54 DRAFTmass, volume, and long-term reliability, but also in terms of the operational aspect of the technology, such as ensuring calibration and translating the information provided by these technologies into a suitable form such that crew can manage nominal and off-nominal situations. Extended-duration missions will require mitigation of acoustic risks, such as increases in noise levels due to aging vehicle systems and off-nominal situations, and lack of crew time to adequately monitor and analyze frequency or spatial coverage in order to recognize increased noise levels. Also, crew desensitization to gradual increases in noise may result in exposure to higher-than-acceptable noise levels. Benefits of Technology An alerting capability for acoustic monitoring must be provided to combat crew desensitization to gradual increases in cabin noise. The approach to developing environmental monitoring sensors is to leverage the rapidly-advancing communities in microelectronics, biotechnology , and chemical and biological terrorism defense, and the intrinsic drive in the commercial market for the development of smaller , more reliable, and more capable technology.

Because of the presence of particulates, this type of fire detection is susceptible to false alarms in a zero-gravity environment. This detection scheme is coupled to a single-use, pressurized fire-suppression bottle to manage fires onboard spacecraft. To help mitigate a fire emergency scenario, information from ground assessments of material flammability in normal gravity at the highest operational oxygen concentration is used in the material selection process during vehicle design. The SOA for fire suppression is a single-use, pressurized vessel of CO 2 that removes the oxygen leg of the fire triangle. However, when discharged, CO concentrations in the immediate area increase well beyond safe levels for crew, requiring isolation of the area and supplemental CO2 2 scrubbing. Moreover, CO2 is not effective for combustion events involving a fuel source that generates self-sustaining heat due to the lack of natural convection in microgravity necessitating the use of single-use, pressurized water mist extinguishers. The objective of spacecraft fire safety is to develop technologies that ensure crew health and safety by reducing the likelihood of a fire, or, if one occurs, minimizing risk to the crew, mission, and system. This is accomplished by addressing the flammability of materials in low and partial gravity , fire detection, fire suppression, and post-fire cleanup. Verifying the flammability limit at length and time scales relevant for spacecraft and evaluating material toxicity and potential toxic or corrosive gas generation in various environments and gravity fields will be a challenge. Advanced fire suppression agents and architectures and hardware for various types of fires with various spatial configurations in spacecraft under low- and partial-gravity will be a challenge. Knowledge of combustion events has greatly benefited from experiments performed onboard the ISS in microgravity, as well as ground-based experiments. These experiments, coupled with material flammability testing, have provided a solid basis not only for managing combustion events on spacecraft, but also in the design of the spacecraft environment. A major objective for fire detection and suppression is gaining a greater understanding of the combustion event in low- or partial-gravity at the dif ferent pressures and oxygen concentrations defined by the various missions; for example, a low-pressure environment with high oxygen concentrations. Knowing the behavior of combustion events under these intermediate conditions will help determine the strategies needed to manage potential cabin fires during surface missions. The major challenge for fire research is predicting flammability in low-pressure and partial-gravity environments, as materials can burn at lower oxygen concentrations than they do in normal gravity . This means that materials that are non-flammable in normal gravity in certain configurations may actually allow a flame to propagate in low or partial gravity in those same configurations. A deeper understanding of flame propagation within this context is needed to properly design and build appropriate fire detection and suppression systems. Development of hybrid fire detection technology that combines gaseous and particulate detection systems will eliminate the potential for false positives that plague current systems. Fire suppressants used in spacecraft should be efficient and nontoxic, and should cause little or no damage to the equipment. They also should be easy to clean up with onboard resources and have the ability to reach any corner of the spacecraft. Technologies should also be multi-use; specifically, fire suppression system must be rechargeable during the mission. These topics will be even more critical for long-duration exploration missions, since rapid return to Earth is not an option and the ability to safely continue the mission will substantially increase the probability of mission success. This must be accomplished without adding complexity to the fire-response process or increasing required consumables.2015 NASA Technology Roadmaps TA 6: Human Health, Life Support, and Habitation SystemsTA 6 - 56 DRAFTBenefits of Technology Early fire detection improvements to minimize false alarms require both particulate and gaseous species detection, as well as distributed sensors. Reducing the size and power consumption of both particulate and gaseous species sensors, as well as increasing information content and sensor lifetime, is also required for this capability to be realized. These fire detection systems could potentially be combined with sensors to monitor post-fire cleanup, thereby reducing mass and simplifying crew emergency operations. Table 18.

TA 6 .4 .3 Protective Clothing and Breathing Technical Capability Objectives and Challenges The SOA in protective clothing and breathing technologies for in-flight, off-nominal events relies heavily on the ability to resupply. Typical protective clothing and breathing technology are single-use only and designed for one type of off-nominal event. Silver-shield gloves protect hands from various liquid and solid chemicals but are designed for single use. Respirators with user-changeable cartridges and oxygen masks protect crew from gaseous chemicals. Protective clothing must be able to provide protection in multiple of f-nominal situations that may be encountered during a mission. In addition to this degree of protection, a multi-use capability is required to alleviate the need for resupply. The objective of this area is to provide crews with sufficient capability to address of f-nominal situations within the habitable compartments of spacecraft. Off-nominal events include fire, chemical release, microbial contamination, and unexpected depressurization. Existing technologies will not meet the needs of future exploration, which requires greater independence from Earth because logistical resupply from Earth is not practical. Advancements are needed to reduce weight and cost, yet still provide effective protective clothing and breathing capabilities that can be deployed when needed. Personal protection technology provides crew with the protection necessary to manage of f-nominal situations, such as a fire or a chemical release. Current personal protection technologies are highly specialized for a particular event and are typically single-use only. Given the limited space in spacecraft and the lack of resupply, these characteristics are not compatible with long-duration missions beyond LEO. Multi-use and multi-function personal protection technologies are a major objective. This technology development, as well as the development of remediation technologies, depends upon the development of new materials. Integrating various types of personal protection technologies for multi-use and multi-functions must result in protective clothing and respirators without gaps or loss of protection. Development should be cognizant of human factors so as not to hinder mobility and communication. Personal protection technology depends on the ability of materials to provide a barrier to hazardous agents and physical stresses. As such, the development of personal protection technology is tied directly to materials development. Materials that are resistant to chemicals, not permeable to liquids, and resistant to tears are required in order to develop the personal protection technology needed for exploration missions. Additionally, human factors issues such as fit, comfort, and mobility should be addressed at the design stage. Multi-use capability, which is dictated by the limitations of resupply during long-duration missions, will necessitate the 2015 NASA Technology Roadmaps TA 6: Human Health, Life Support, and Habitation SystemsTA 6 - 57 DRAFTneed to verify the cleanliness and integrity of the personal protection technology . Breathing technology will also depend on materials development. Multi-use capability may drive the development of respirator filters containing multiple type of filtering media. Crew comfort, flow rates, and other human factor issues must be addressed early in the development of breathing technology. Benefits of Technology Protective clothing and breathing technologies for in-flight, off-nominal events rely heavily on the ability to resupply. Advancements are needed to reduce weight and cost, yet still provide effective protective clothing and breathing capabilities that can be deployed when needed. Protective gloves need to provide protection in a multitude of situations and still allow crew to perform precision movements. Proper ocular protection will also be required. Protective clothing should provide a great degree of comfort while simultaneously providing the required protection. Protective clothing and breathing technologies must be effective, regenerable (if applicable), and deployable by crew in various off-nominal situations. Improvements are needed to evolve coveralls and gloves that are resistant to fire, chemicals, and microbes. The difficulty in this effort lies in the ability to verify the efficacy of protective articles and respirators for use in another off-nominal event. Functionality, as well as cleanliness, needs to be assessed immediately after use, and means to ensure the protective clothing can be used in a subsequent off-nominal event must be developed.

TA 6 .4 .4 Remediation Technical Capability Objectives and Challenges The focus of remediation is to provide crew with the ability to clean the habitable environment of the spacecraft in the event of an off-nominal situation. Off-nominal events include fire, an inadvertent chemical release (toxic leak event), or microbial contamination. The SOA in remediation technologies for in-flight off-nominal events relies heavily on the ability to resupply. Methods to regenerate current materials employ heat to desorb contaminants from the surface, thereby increasing power requirements. Metallocenes and hybrid organic or inorganic catalysts have been shown to immobilize contaminants. Combining this capturing ability with the ability to undergo light-induced conformational changes in the geometry of the catalyst, regenerable remediation technology may be possible with very low power requirements. Although these technologies are at the research level, they represent the type of development required for future missions. Advancements are needed to reduce weight and cost over current methods, yet still provide ef fective remediation capabilities that can be deployed when needed. Remediation technologies must be ef fective, regenerable (if applicable), and deployable by crew in various of f-nominal situations. Personal protective equipment suitable for spaceflight and provide multi-use protection from chemical, combustion, and microbial contamination hazards are needed.2015 NASA Technology Roadmaps TA 6: Human Health, Life Support, and Habitation SystemsTA 6 - 58 DRAFTBenefits of Technology Remediation technology will provide crew with the ability to rectify of f-nominal events by returning a volume of spacecraft back into habitable space. Remediation technology also provides a level of protection to the nominal functions of a vehicle's ECLS systems by helping remove the burden an off-nominal situation can create. Designed operating margins of safety can be maintained throughout the mission, and design lifetime can be achieved. Remediation techniques may be incorporated into the ECLSS architecture and/or operate independently of the ECLSS to offer operational flexibility and functional factors of safety. Table 20.

Possible other improvements include combining shielding with biological countermeasures to enhance effectiveness and developing higher-fidelity space radiation monitoring capabilities in the form of miniaturized active personal dosimetry . These improvements will help minimize crew radiation risk and support operations for long-duration, human exploration missions beyond LEO. Exposure to space radiation poses both acute and chronic risks to crew health and safety that have clinically- relevant, lifelong implications. The major risks include radiation carcinogenesis, acute syndromes, acute and late central nervous system (CNS) effects, and degenerative tissue (e.g., cardiac, gastro-intestinal, circulatory) effects. The major technical challenge for future human space exploration is determining the best way to protect humans from the high-charge and high-energy galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) permeating interplanetary space. With our current knowledge base, there is a need to provide mitigation technologies (such as biological countermeasures and shielding) against GCR for missions occurring beyond LEO for more than than about 100 days to remain below PELs for space radiation. Exposure estimates for longer missions, including Mars, are estimated at about three to five times above PELs. This technical challenge is extremely difficult because 1) GCR heavy ions cause damage at the cellular and tissue levels that is substantially different from the damage caused by terrestrial radiation (such as x-rays or gamma rays), as GCR heavy ions have significantly higher ionization density and large associated uncertainties exist in quantifying the associated biological response; and 2) shielding against GCR is much more difficult than shielding against terrestrial radiation, due to severe mass constraints and the ability of GCR to penetrate shielding material (high-charge and high-energy). Shielding from solar particle events (SPEs) is much easier than shielding from GCR. Protecting humans from SPEs may be a solvable problem in the near-term by maturing identified shielding solutions through design and configuration. However, mission operational planning has a major knowledge gap of forecasting the occurrence and magnitude, as well as all-clear periods, of SPEs. Primary radiation technologies requiring advancement include radiation risk projection models that use validated ground and flight data, radiation mitigation measures, space weather forecasting, radiation protection, and radiation monitoring. Without accurate risk projection models, the ef fectiveness of shielding materials for GCR, mitigation measures, and crew selection criteria are poorly defined. The accuracy of risk models must improve as the level of risk increases from the ISS to near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) and Mars in order to develop the technologies necessary to ensure crew safety . The Radiation area (6.5) has technologies that crosscut with other sub-areas in TA 6, as well as with other TAs. Within TA 6, the predictive models and lifelong monitoring tools that require maturation to support Long-Duration Health (6.3.2) will also benefit radiation Risk Assessment Modeling (6.5.1). Similarly, there will be synergistic technologies between EVA Systems (6.2) and radiation Protection Systems (6.5.3). Radiation Protection Systems (6.5.3) will benefit from technology advances in TA 12 Materials, Structures, Mechanical Systems and Manufacturing; similarly, radiation Risk Assessement Modeling (6.5.1) and radiation Monitoring Technology (6.5.5) may benefit from advances in TA 11 Modeling, Simulation, Information Technology, and Processing. Radiation Monitoring Technology (6.5.5) may also benefit from advances in TA 10 Nanotechnology. 2015 NASA Technology Roadmaps TA 6: Human Health, Life Support, and Habitation SystemsTA 6 - 60 DRAFTSub-Goals Unlike some other aspects of space travel, space radiation exposure has clinically-relevant implications for the lifetime of the crew. It is currently estimated that long-term missions could increase the chance of fatal cancer anywhere from five to 21 percent above the baseline risk. Radiation health and performance risks include carcinogenesis, acute syndromes, acute and late CNS effects, and tissue degeneration. The challenge of ensuring crew safety means that 'risk limits' are sufficiently understood, defined, and not exceeded. The purpose of the radiation sub-goals is to ensure that the radiation risk to astronauts is reduced to as low as reasonably achieved (ALARA). The focus is on developing technologies to increase crew mission duration in the free-space radiation environment while remaining below the space radiation PELs. Specifically , the five technology development objectives center on reducing uncertainty in assessing the risk of death due to radiation exposure, extending the number of safe days in space using biological countermeasures (BCMs) or shielding, improving the ability to predict the future space weather events and their duration to prepare and protect the crew, and developing small, low-mass, low-power, crew-friendly sensors for monitoring the radiation environment. It is generally accepted that extending crew mission duration in free space will be accomplished using a combination of shielding, BCMs, improved understanding of risks, and the improved means to predict and monitor the radiation environment.

TA 6 .5 .1 Risk Assessment Modeling Technical Capability Objectives and Challenges Current radiation risk assessment models are used to estimate cancer risk from radiation to crew during operations in LEO. These models do not include synergistic, circulatory, or CNS effects. In addition, they are based on scaling data derived from terrestrial radiation exposures to the spaceflight environment and are not truly representative of the free-space radiation environment. Additionally, current cancer models have 350 percent uncertainty. For missions beyond LEO, modeling tools need to be improved to more accurately and precisely predict lifetime risk of morbidity and mortality, and to appropriately sum risk from different endpoints, such as cancer, CNS, and other degenerative diseases, and degradation of performance. Major advances are required to reduce uncertainties associated with radiation risk projection models for both NEA and Mars missions so that the impacts of optimized use of shielding designs, mission length, crew selection, and mitigation measures can be quantified. The objective is to improve the models such that uncertainty is reduced to 50 percent for all radiation exposure risk for Mars missions (1,000-day mission), and to 200 percent for near-term NEA missions (365-day mission). A major challenge for radiation will be to acquire sufficient ground analog and flight data on living systems exposed to the relevant space environment, develop models that accurately predict radiation risks, identify genetic factors, and develop mitigation measures for remaining risk. Benefits of Technology Radiation risk assessment and modeling tools that are well understood and provide minimal uncertainty are needed to assess astronaut risk due to space radiation exposure. These will improve mission operations, mission planning, and system design for LEO, deep-space, lunar, and Mars missions. Tools currently used to estimate cancer risk from radiation to crew during operations in LEO do not include synergistic ef fects. 2015 NASA Technology Roadmaps TA 6: Human Health, Life Support, and Habitation SystemsTA 6 - 62 DRAFTTable 22.

Computational tools enabling the accurate prediction of radiation exposures within the human body given a known free-space radiation environment (i.e. tools that account for modifications to the particle environment as radiation transits planetary atmosphere, vehicle materials, and human tissue). Models need to interface with NASA design processes within reasonable timeframes.Transport and Nuclear Physics Modeling Tool(s) for Radiation Exposure (Transport Codes)6.5.1.7 TA 6 .5 .2 Radiation Mitigation and Biological Countermeasures Technical Capability Objectives and Challenges New molecular or genetic-based systems biology approaches are needed to achieve the uncertainty levels required for long-duration missions (missions lasting more than about 100 days). Biological countermeasures need to reduce the risk of adverse biological effects due to space radiation without having adverse side effects or causing a loss of life. Significant advances are required to integrate fundamental research on the cellular , molecular, and tissue damage caused by space radiation into modeling major signaling pathways that cause cancer, CNS effects, and degenerative diseases. Once these are understood, BCMs can be developed that minimize or prevent physical, cognitive, and behavior disorders due to space radiation. BCMs also need to protect against radiation-induced oxidative stress; mitigate cancer initiation and promotion; protect against cardiovascular disease and cardiac events; and protect against immune dysfunction and radiation-induced burns and delayed wound healing. Currently, mitigation strategies for radiation exposure are based on acute exposure to gamma radiation. Several BCMs have been studied to prevent or mitigate the effect of radiation and are approved for use under these conditions. Few treatments have been investigated in a simulated space environment. There are currently no BCMs approved to mitigate or prevent the deleterious ef fects of space radiation. Some agents have been developed for low linear energy transfer (LET) radiation at high doses. However , the terrestrial agents are based on historical data from terrestrial radiation sources and do not translate well to the space radiation environment. Computational tools to model pharmaceutical interactions are also needed. This would enable the evaluation of drug response and interactions individually and in combination with other drugs, and provide an individual sensitivity toolkit to determine effectiveness and toxicity of BCMs for individual astronauts.2015 NASA Technology Roadmaps TA 6: Human Health, Life Support, and Habitation SystemsTA 6 - 63 DRAFTBenefits of Technology There have been minimal studies performed to assess BCMs in a simulated space radiation environment, representing an acute exposure or high LET radiation, and no studies have been performed under a simulated low-dose, chronic space radiation environment. Radiation countermeasures must demonstrate a reduction in the risk of adverse ef fects due to radiation and a corresponding increased number of safe days for the crew. An objective would be to reduce the risk of adverse effects to less than the three percent Risk of Exposure Induced Death (REID), or increase the days the BCMs can protect the crew for a total mission (transit and stays). The BCMs effects would be combined with other protective measures to minimize the risk of radiation-induced ef fects to the crew. A challenge is that one type of BCM will not be enough. A suite of BCMs will need to be developed to address the various health problems expected due to the radiation exposure. Table 23.

Address individual sensitivity. Toolkit has promise to lower mission costs and enable longer duration missions. TA 6 .5 .3 Protection Systems Technical Capability Objectives and Challenges The design of integrated radiation protection shielding that extend beyond LEO exploration missions duration by more than 60 days, within the scope of reasonable vehicle design and mass. Limited passive shielding options that consist of rearranging moveable components to create a shield or using additive slabs of polyethylene exist for mitigating radiation exposure during SPEs, but there is no shielding option for long-duration protection from GCR. The types of materials that can provide passive shielding of humans against radiation are well known, but mission designers will need to take a cross-disciplinary , integrated systems approach to develop lightweight, cost-effective, multi-functional solutions. Active radiation shielding is at low TRL. High-fidelity simulations of active radiation shielding systems are needed to determine which of the system components will give the largest improvements in shielding capability . Areas that hold the most promise are advances in lightweight structures and magnets, superconductors, and active cooling systems. It is generally accepted that protective shielding cannot completely protect against GCR. Therefore, shielding options combined with BCMs will be needed to protect humans for long-duration missions.2015 NASA Technology Roadmaps TA 6: Human Health, Life Support, and Habitation SystemsTA 6 - 64 DRAFTShielding from SPEs is much easier than shielding from GCR. Protecting humans from SPEs may be a solvable problem in the near-term by maturing identified shielding solutions through design and configuration. Shielding systems must be developed while considering vehicle design and mass versus the amount of protection achieved. The objective is to optimize systems to achieve reductions in crew exposure to GCR and SPE for beyond-LEO missions. There are two approaches to determine performance: 1) percent reduction in astronaut exposure for percent increase in mass over SOA vehicle design, and/or 2) number of days for mission for accepted PELs with reasonable increase in mass of SOA vehicle design. Benefits of Technology Development of advanced radiation protection systems will allow crew members to stay within the NASA PELs for longer-duration exploration missions beyond LEO while impacting the overall vehicle mass as little as possible.

This limits mission efficiency and could increase the likelihood of damaging vehicle systems and increasing astronaut radiation exposure. Of primary concern for future long-duration missions outside of LEO are Solar Energetic Proton (SEP) events (i.e., the transient increase in energetic protons levels), and large Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs). There is no current ability to predict the onset, intensity, and evolution of SEPs and CME arrival time. Although SEP exposure can, in theory, be mitigated by passive shielding, vehicle mass constraints can limit the degree of mitigation for any future long-duration mission. It is thus vital that tools for forecasting occurrence and magnitude be developed for future exploration to alert flight control teams and crews of impending adverse conditions. The objective of these tools would be to provide forecasts on time windows from days to weeks with high confidence and low false alarm rates. Benefits of Technology Forecasting solutions will allow flight control teams to conduct missions with higher efficiency and greater safety. Advanced warning will allow critical systems to be safed prior to adverse space weather conditions. Probabilistic models will allow for higher fidelity mass trades of future vehicles, resulting in better mission risk assessment. Ensemble forecasting techniques will provide better integration of multiple space weather data streams for gleaning the most relevant information needed for mission-critical operational decision points.

Current monitoring technologies for in-mission radiation environmental measurements are either passive (crew badges, area monitors), requiring return to ground for analysis post-facto, or are larger , multi-kilogram, approximately 10 Watt (W) systems for ambient monitoring, perhaps away from crews and sensitive vehicle systems. Further advancements are needed in the design and development of miniaturized personal dosimeters for crew, low mass and low-power active radiation instrumentation, and advanced warning systems for spacecraft to minimize and monitor exposures during operations. Currently, astronaut exposure to radiation is monitored through passive personal dosimeters. A variety of other measurement devices have also been used on the ISS with output dose, dose equivalent, or particle fluence. These devices are not integrated into ISS systems and therefore require astronaut time for deployment. Advanced, miniaturized radiation measurement devices will need to be adapted to spaceflight hardware prototypes and demonstrated and matured on available platforms as integrated vehicle systems. Additionally, advancements need to be made in the mass, power required, measured quantity , battery life, and wireless capability of personal dosimetry monitoring technologies. Active personal dosimeters should have batteries sufficient for long missions and be small enough to be worn by astronauts. Additionally, they should be able to communicate with vehicle systems wirelessly. Active area dosimeters should have low enough power requirements and be small enough (smart phone size or smaller) that they can be distributed throughout the spacecraft and integrated into the vehicle monitoring systems. Charged particle and neutron spectrometers should be no bigger than the Radiation Assessment Dosimeter (RAD) used on the robotic Mars mission Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) and be able to measure the particles and energy ranges at least as broad as those measured by current compact systems. Benefits of Technology Improvements to monitoring devices will enable better mapping of the radiation environment of exploration vehicles and habitats; improved data streams communicated to the crew and ground; and reduced volume, mass, and power consumption by these monitoring devices.

Understand the system implications and break-over points for designing a pressure garment system, which can be utilized by occupants with 5th to 95th percentile American dimensions in any or all of the identified critical dimensions.

Technology Challenge : The challenge is in developing technologies that can be integrated to meet the desired end product. Often, solutions to one problem make solutions to other problems non-viable. Also, hardcoat antifog solutions developed in the past have proven to be non-viable due to two primary challenges. First, the slight expansion and contraction that happens during pressurization of the helmet must be addressed by the coating without causing cracking and crazing of the coating. Second, the coating must be durable enough to withstand 100 extravehicular activities (EVAs) of use (including helmet cleaning that is often necessary between EVAs). Technology State of the Art : The Z2 suit (currently in development) includes a new helmet geometry that will address a subset of these issues (particularly helmet shape and vent inlet for CO 2 washout). Durable permanent antifog solutions have been attempted under the Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) program without success.

Human hand physiology puts numerous joints in close proximity , making design challenging. Additionally, human hand variation is considerable. The human hand has some of the smallest muscles in the body, but they are also the most used muscles in an EVA scenario. All of these factors make glove design a difficult task.

Developing small non-regenerable non-venting CO2 removal hardware is anticipated to require significant out of the box thinking.

Alternate chemistries may provide a greater capacity and efficiency in removing CO2 2 and provide a lower preference for removing water and therefore result in less loo p drying. Technology Challenge : The challenge is to improve on the performance of the SA9T sorbent while at the same time mitigating non- desirable aspects, such as NH3 liberation into the ventilation loop. Additionally, if trace contaminant control functionality can be integrated, carbon or other swingbed or passive membrane approaches could be developed that meet the functional requirements while mitigating NH production. Implementation of the swingbed approach over a single sorbent bed also of fers the complexity of the valving and motor actuators 3 to facilitate the bed swing which must be addressed. A passive membrane approach must have a high selectivity > 1400 for CO2 over O2 in order to be acceptable at the system level; this has yet to be achieved at ambient temperature. Technology State of the Art : One of the technologies for accomplishing this task, amine swingbed, can meet many of the functional requirements but also releases NH3 into the ventilation loop and concentrates it during storage periods.
