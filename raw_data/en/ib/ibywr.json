The Primary data element for XYZ Analysis: Current Available Stock Quantity. A system of categorization, with similarities to Pareto analysis, the method usually categorizes inventory into three bands with each band having a different management control associated. Although different criteria may be applied to each category the typical method of \"scoring\" an inventory item is that of annual stock value of said item (qty in stock X cost of item) with the result then ranked and then scored (X, Y or Z). Bandings may be specific to the industry but typically follow a 70%, 90%, 100% banding in that X class items represent 70% of the stock value (although they may account for 20% number wise), Y class items fall between 70% and 90% of the annual stock value with C class the remaining. In practical terms the complex high cost materials typically fall into the X class items, with the consumable, low cost (and typically fast moving) classed as X class.

For a product, these attributes include, but are not limited to, manufacturer, product description, material, size, color, packaging, and warranty terms. When a business takes an inventory, it counts the quantity of each stock keeping unit. SKU can also refer to a unique identifier or code that refers to the particular stock keeping unit. SKUs are not always physical objects. Anything that can be sold separately from anything else has a stock keeping unit, such as extended warranties, delivery fees, installation fees, and licenses.Varchar 30 Inventory Ayurvedic Generic Drug Name 05.031.0156Name of generic drug based on controlled vocabulary of Ayurveda, e.g. Sitopaladi Churna etc. Values: Refer Code Directory CD05.136Varchar 254 Inventory Ayurvedic Brand Drug Name 05.031.0157Name of the branded Ayurvedic drugs as manufactured by different pharmaceutical companies, e.g. LIV 52, Mentat etc. Values: Refer Code Directory CD05.137Varchar 254 National Committee on Meta Data and Data Standards for Health Domain Overview Report 25Entity Name of Data Element and its IdentifierDescription of Data Element Data FormatMax Size Remarks Inventory Unani Generic Drug Name 05.031.0158Name of generic drug based on controlled vocabulary of Unani, e.g. Khamira Abreshametc. Values: Refer Code Directory CD05.138Varchar 254 Inventory Unani Brand Drug Name 05.031.0159Name of the branded Unani drugs as manufactured by different pharmaceutical companies, e.g. Sualin etc. Values: Refer Code Directory CD05.139Varchar 254 Inventory Homeopathy Generic Drug Name 05.031.0160Name of generic drug based on controlled vocabulary of Homeopathy, e.g. Thuja Values: Refer Code Directory CD05.042Varchar 254 Inventory Homeopathy Brand Drug Name 05.031.0161Name of the branded Homeopathic drugs as manufactured by different pharmaceutical companies e.g. Alfavena Malt, Aller Aid etc. Values: Refer Code Directory CD05.060Varchar 254 Inventory Non-Drug Item Classification 05.031.0162Classification of Non-Drug inventories into various categories such as surgical, non-surgical supplies, Consumables, Disposable and Durables.

Although facility is assigned a sequential integer code which will be generated by database system and used as a unique facility identifier, still the implementation of unique integer code as facility identifier is very much dependent on database system which generate these numbers and does not ensure an essential guarantee to be always unique e.g. in case if database is ported from one DBMS system to another, the unique sequential numbers (or auto increment primary keys of tables will change) In order to avoid this problem, we propose to use guid along with unique facility identification code to be used as attributes in Facility masterbits 16 National Committee on Meta Data and Data Standards for Health Domain Overview Report 51Entity Name of Data Element and its IdentifierDescription of Data Element Data Format Max SizeRemarks Episode Episode ID 05.009.0001Identifier assigned to a Patient Episode. An episode of care consists of all clinically related services for one patient for a discrete diagnostic condition from the onset of symptoms until the treatment is complete. Thus, for every new problem or set of problems that a person visits his clinical care provider, it is considered a new episode. Within that episode the patient will have one to many encounters with his clinical care providers till the treatment for that episode is complete. Even before the resolution of an episode, the person may have a new episode that is considered as a distinctly separate event altogether. Thus, there may be none, one or several ongoing active episodes. All resolved episodes are considered inactive. Hence they become part of the patient's past history. A notable point here is that all chronic diseases are considered active and may never get resolved during the life-Time of the person, e.g., diabetes mellitus, hypertension, etc.Varchar 50 Episode Episode Type 05.009.0002This data element describes the type of the episode.

It is essential to retain permanent records of all patient encounters. Unique ID to be assigned for each patient encounter. A clinical encounter is defined as (1) an instance of direct provider/practitioner to patient interaction, regardless of the setting, between a patient and a practitioner vested with primary responsibility for diagnosing, evaluating or treating the patient's condition, or both, or providing social worker services. (2) A contact between a patient and a practitioner who has primary responsibility for assessing and treating the patient at a given contact, exercising independent judgment. Encounter serves as a focal point linking clinical, administrative and financial information. Encounters occur in many different settings - ambulatory care, inpatient care, emergency care, home health care, field and virtual (telemedicine). It must be ensured that no encounter number is arbitrarily assigned. The system will need to ensure this. When linking records from diverse systems, episode and encounter reconciliation through appropriate merging and demerging will need to take place.

Although facility is assigned a sequential integer code which will be generated by database system and used as a unique facility identifier, still the implementation of unique integer code as facility identifier is very much dependent on database system which generate these numbers and does not ensure an essential guarantee to be always unique e.g. in case if database is ported from one DBMS system to another, the unique sequential numbers (or auto increment primary keys of tables will change) In order to avoid this problem, we propose to use guid along with unique facility identification code to be used as attributes in Facility master.bits 16 82 National Committee on Meta Data and Data Standards for Health Domain Overview ReportEntity Name of Data Element and its IdentifierDescription of Data Element Data FormatMax Size Remarks Episode Episode ID 05.009.0001Identifier assigned to a Patient Episode. An episode of care consists of all clinically related services for one patient for a discrete diagnostic condition from the onset of symptoms until the treatment is complete. Thus, for every new problem or set of problems that a person visits his clinical care provider, it is considered a new episode. Within that episode the patient will have one to many encounters with his clinical care providers till the treatment for that episode is complete. Even before the resolution of an episode, the person may have a new episode that is considered as a distinctly separate event altogether. Thus, there may be none, one or several ongoing active episodes. All resolved episodes are considered inactive. Hence they become part of the patient's past history. A notable point here is that all chronic diseases are considered active and may never get resolved during the life-Time of the person, e.g., diabetes mellitus, hypertension, etc.Varchar 50 Episode Episode Type 05.009.0002This data element describes the type of the episode.

A clinical encounter is defined as (1) an instance of direct provider/ practitioner to patient interaction, regardless of the setting, between a patient and a practitioner vested with primary responsibility for diagnosing, evaluating or treating the patient's condition, or both, or providing social worker services. (2) A contact between a patient and a practitioner who has primary responsibility for assessing and treating the patient at a given contact, exercising independent judgment. Encounter serves as a focal point linking clinical, administrative and financial information. Encounters occur in many different settings - ambulatory care, inpatient care, emergency care, home health care, field and virtual (telemedicine). It must be ensured that no encounter number is arbitrarily assigned. The system will need to ensure this.
