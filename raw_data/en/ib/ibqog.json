Using a rational design and library approach, we engineered stable HA stem antigens ( \"mini-HAs \") based on an H1 subtype sequence. Our most advanced candidate exhibits structural and bnAb binding properties comparable to those of full-length HA, completely protects mice in lethal heterologous and heterosubtypi c challenge models, and reduces fever after sublethal challenge in cynomolgus monkeys. Antibodies elicited by this mini-HA in mice and nonhuman primates bound a wide range of HAs, competed with human bnAbs for HA stem binding, neutralized H5N1 viruses, and mediated antibody-dependent effec tor activity. These results represent a proof of concept for the design of HA stem mimics that elicit bnAbs against influenza A group 1 viruses. The ultimate goal of influenza vaccinology is the development of a universal vaccinethat protects against a wide range of strains and subtypes, thereby eliminating the needfor seasonal reformulation of vaccines and providing an effective defense against viruseswith pandemic potential. The relatively recent discovery of broadly neutralizing human mono- clonal antibodies (bnAbs) against influenzaviruses ( 1-8) has raised hopes that a broadly pro- tective vaccine may indeed be feasible ( 9-13). Because the majority of these bnAbs are directedtoward co nformational epitopesin the hemagglutinin (HA) stem ( 1,2,4,5,7), this r e g i o nm a yh a v et h ep o t e n t i a lt oi n d u c eb r o a dprotective immunity, provided it is well exposed and properly presented. Various strategies to enhance exposure of the HA stem to the immune system are being ex- plored, including presentation on self-assembling nanoparticles (14 virus-like particle ( 17), and immune refocusing ( 18). Yet another approach involves removal of the HA head while stabiliz-ing the HA stem. A prerequisite for generating a b r o a d l yp r o t e c t i v es o l u b l eH As t e mi m m u n o g e nis that it is stable and structurally resembles thestem of full-length (FL) HA. This simple and ele- gant concept is complicated by serious structural constraints ( 19). HA is a metastable pH(22). Removal of the transmembrane domain and HA head without extensive structural modifica-tions to stabilize the remaining molecule inevita- bly leads to loss of native conformation of the HA stem ( 19) and concomitant loss of conformational bnAb epitopes. Previously reported soluble HAstem- derived immunogens have exhibited lower affinity with bnAbs relative to FL HA, indicatingsuboptimal conformation ( 23-26). Design and initial characterization Starting with the HA sequence of H1N1 A/Brisbane/ 59/2007, changes were introduced using a com-bination of rational design and library approaches(27). In the first design phase (stages I to III; Fig. 1A), we aimed to generate a soluble andstable HA stem monomer containing bnAb epi- topes in the correct conformation, whereas in the final stages (stages IV and V), we aimed to createa mini-HA in its natural trimeric form. Details on the design, sequences, and screening are out- lined in ( 27) and figs. S1 and S2. As a readout for a native-like stem conformation of the mini-HAconstructs, we used the binding of bnAbs CR9114 and CR6261 (both of which recognize epitopes in the HA stem) ( 28). From each design stage, the best-performing candidates were selected for fur-ther optimization. Key mutations in these lead candidates are schematically depicted in fig. S2 and on a model structure of mini-HA in Fig. 1B. Selected mini-HAs #4157 (stage II), #4454 (stage III), #4650 (stage IV), and #4900 (stage V) were expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293F cells and purified. On the basis ofsize, mini-HAs #4454 appeared pre- dominantly monomeric in #4650 was larger, suggesting at least partial formation ofdimers, whereas #4900 appeared trimeric (fig.S3A). was confirmed gel nonreducing and reducing conditions(fig. have four putative N-linked glycosylation sites (Fig. 1B). Under reducing conditions, the mini-HAbands were diffuse and ran at higher molecular weight (35 to 45 kD) than expected (29 kD), in- dicating that the mini-HAs were glycosylated(fig. S3B). withpeptide-N-glycosidase as for mini-HA #4900 in fig. S3B). The glycans appear relevant for proper fold-ing, as attempts to efficiently produce mini-HAwith retention of bnAb epitopes in bacteria were not successful ( 29). Size exclusion chromatography with inline multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS) anal-ysis revealed a single peak (fig. S4A), with av- erage molecular weights of 40 kD kD for #4650, and 108 kD for #4900(Table 1), which also indicated that #4157 and #4454 are monomeric in solution, #4650 forms dimers (at least in part), and #4900 forms tri-mers. In the presence of CR9114 or CR6261 Fabs,a peak shift to shorter retention time was ob- served for all mini-HAs, indicating formation of complexes (fig. S4A), which was confirmedby MALS (Table 1), with masses in agreementwith binding of one Fab (monomeric mini-HAs #4157 and #4454), one to three (trimeric mini-HA#4900) ( and CR6261 to four can- didate immunogens was i n the nanomolar range, with affinity improving as the design processprogressed (Table 1 and fig.

Structural characterization Modifications introduced throughout the design gradually increased the conformational stability as determined by hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) ( 31,32). In introduced in III (from#4157 to #4454) and stage V (from #4650 to #4900) stabilized the overall structure and theshorter A helix (Fig. 2). Furthermore, we ob- served only a low level of deuterium exchange on the long CD helix of mini-HA #4900, likelydue to the shielding effect caused by trimeriza- tion. Most important, the HDX pattern of mini- HA #4900 is very similar to that of trimeric FLHA, further demonstrating that the final designmimics the structure and dynamics of native HA. In line with these findings, the overall stability of t h em i n i - H A sa l s oe v o l v e d ,a si sa p p a r e n tf r o mmeasurements of the thermal stability (fig. S5). Complexes of mini-HAs with CR9114 Fab were first studied by negative-stain electron micros-copy (EM) (Fig. 3A). The EM class averages illus-trate the progression from monomeric (#4454) to a more heterogeneous mixture of monomers and dimers (#4650) and fin ally to a trimeric form (#4900). To provide further structural insights,we determined the crystal structures of #4454- CR9114 and #4900-CR9114 Fab complexes to 4.3 \u00c5 and 3.6 \u00c5 resolution, respectively (Fig. 3, B andC, and table S1) ( 27).

These results convincingly demonstrate that the iterative design process led to antigens with an increasingly improvedHA stem conformation and ultimately yieldedHA-like stem antigens with a preserved CR9114 epitope. In vivo effects When tested in mice, all mini-HAs were highly immunogenic, eliciting high titers of antibodiesbinding to the FL HA of the A/Brisbane/59/2007(H1N1) strain used as the basis for mini-HA gen- eration (fig.

Next, we evaluated the ability of mini-HA im- munogens to provide protection against strin- gent lethal challenges and characterized the elicited immune response ( F i g .4a n df i g .S 7 ) .P r o - tection against influenza challenge with H1N1 A/PR/8/34 (heterologous to the parental strain used for design of the mini-HAs) was assessedafter one, two, or three immunizations with (monomer, variant mini-HA #2759 were only partiallyprotected against mortality and showed severe weight loss and clinical symptoms, whereas #4650 and #4900 provided complete protection, with#4900-immunized mice showing neither weightloss nor clinical symptoms (Fig. 4A and fig.

Evenafter one immunization, #4900 exhibited 90% protection against mortality, although animals exhibited some (recoverable) weight loss andclinical symptoms, whereas #4650 and #2759were not able to protect animals. Antibodies elicited with mini-HA #4900 after two and threeimmunizations competed with bnAb CR9114 forbinding to the FL HA stem (Fig. 4A), which shows that this mini-HA could readily elicit antibodies specific for bnAb stem epitopes. Mice immunized three times with an ex- panded set mini-HAs were challenged with heterosubtypic H5N1 A/Hong breadth of #4157 (monomers) failed to elicit pro- tection, #4454 (improved library monomer) and #4650 exhibited partial protection, whereas#4900 exhibited complete protection with nei-ther weight loss nor clinical symptoms (Fig. 4B and fig. S7D). To further investigate antibody- mediated effector mechanisms, we tested pre-challenge sera and to some extent #4650, showeddetectable neutralization, demonstrating the ability of these mini-HAs to elicit bnAbs (Fig. 4C). Besides direct virus neutralization, mechanisms, such as antibody-dependentcellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), contribute substan- tially to protection against stem-directed bnAbs being particularly effective inthese mechanisms ( 35). We therefore used a test prechallenge sera ( 36-38). The evolving mini- HAs demonstrated an increasing ability to elicit antibodies with potential to induce ADCC (Fig. 4D), with ADCC potency of serum antibodies cor-responding to survival proportions observed int h eH 5 N 1c h a l l e n g em o d e l .I na c c o r d a n c ew i t h the binding data (fig. S7, A and B), mini-HA #4900 elicited ADCC responses to a wide rangeof group 1 influenza A HAs (fig. S7E). To assesswhether serum antibodies are indeed responsible for the observed in vivo protection, we passively transferred serum from mice immunized with#4650 and #4900 to na\u00efve mice and subsequentlychallenged the recipient mice with A/HK/156/97 (H5N1) virus (Fig. 4E and fig. S7F). In contrast to mice that received mock serum, mice thatreceived serum from mini-HA -immunized mice were significantly protected, proving that anti- bodies play a key role in the protection elicitedby mini-HAs. 1304 18 SEPTEMBER 2015 \u007fVOL 349 ISSUE 6254 sciencemag.org SCIENCE Fig. 4.

In a recent study (26), a bacterially produced trimeric HA stem construct also seemed more effective than mono-meric versions in eliciting protection in an ani- mal influenza challenge model. We next tested the immunogenicity and pro- tective efficacy of a three-dose regimen cynomolgus monkeys ( Macaca fascicularis ). As controls, groups of six monkeys received three injections of phosphate-bufferedsaline (PBS) or two human doses of a trivalentseasonal influenza vaccine (the standard of care for na\u00efve children). As previously observed in mice, #4900 elicited high titers of antibodies inmonkeys that were able to bind to a wide range of group 1 FL HAs (Fig. 5A and fig. S8A); com- pete and heterosubtypicHAs (Fig. 5B); and elicit ADCC responses to (Fig. Furthermore, #4900 elic- ited H5N1 pseudoparticle-basedneutralization assay (fig. S8B), as for the mouse sera (Fig. 4C), but also in a standard micro- neutralization assay (Fig. 5D). Relative to mock-immunized monkeys, animals vaccinated with mini-HA #4900 had signif icantly reduced fever after challenge with A/Mexico/InDRE4487/2009(H1N1) virus (Fig. 5E and fig. S8E) ( 39), although no significant effect on the tracheal viral load was detected (fig. S8C). These results are comparable to those from monkeys vaccinated with the tri-valent seasonal influenza vaccine (Fig. 5E and fig.S8C). However, the immune response elicited by mini-HA #4900 differed from the response elic- ited with the trivalent vaccine. As expected, vac-cination with the seasonal vaccine, but not with \"headless \"#4900, elicited hemagglutination- inhibiting (HI) antibodies against A/California/0 7 / 0 9( H 1 N 1 )v i r u s ,f r o mw h i c ht h eH 1c o m p o -nent of the trivalent vacci ne is derived and which is closely related (two am ino acid differences) to the A/Mexico/InDRE4487/2009 (H1N1) virus usedto challenge the monkeys (fig.

Future studies will need to address the minimal doses of mini-HA and adjuvant fora protective response. Be cause preexisting immu- nity may have a profound effect on the breadth of the response and no animal model recapitulatesthe complex preexisting immunity against influ- enza found in humans, such studies should be performed in humans ( 41). Concluding remarks We have described the design and characteri- zation of a series of soluble HA immunogenssolely composed of the HA stem. Although allselected mini-HAs elicited comparable levels of antibodies to FL HA, the breadth and protective ability of the elicited antibodies progressively in-creased with the structural evolution of mini-HAconfiguration. Th e final candidate \u2014stabilized tri- meric mini-HA #4900 \u2014demonstrated its unique ability to elicit broad and protective immune re-sponse in mice and nonhuman primates. It has been reported ( 42,43) that stabilization of respira- tory syncytial virus F antigen improves immuneresponse and protection. Our results demonstratethat the same principle holds for influenza HA and provide further direction for the design of an epitope-based, universal influenza vaccine. REFERENCES AND NOTES 1. D.

CR9114 and CR6261 share a nearly identical epitope formed by helix A of HA2 and a segment of HA1, and both neutralizevirtually all group 1 influenza A strains. CR9114 also neutralizes influenza A group 2 viruses and binds influenza B strains, demonstrating greater breadth relative to CR6261. Because CR6261 appears to have more stringent epitope requirements than CR9114, we used CR6261 binding as the key criterionfor the selection of final candidates.29. The apparent importance of the glycans may partially explain why previously reported HA stem -derived proteins that were expressed in E. coli , and thus not glycosylated, failed to mimic the native HA stem more closely. 30.

Structural differences between the stems of group 1 and group 2 HAs restrict the activity of most bnAbs to one group. Although some antibodies, like CR9114, can bind both groups,such antibodies appear to be extremely rare. The observed lower reactivity to group 2 HAs of immune serum elicited against group 1 HA stem mimics was therefore to be expected. 34. I. Alberini et al.,Vaccine 27, 5998 -6003 (2009). 35. D. J.

The reduction in fever in #4900-vaccinated animals relative to PBS-immunized animals is significant when periods shortlyafter challenge (e.g., 0 to 3 days or 0 to 8 days) are considered, because the fever is most pronounced shortly after challenge. Although still visible when the entire 21-day follow-up period is considered, the reduction is no longer statistically significant because of the large variation in measured body temperatures. 40. R.

L. Mao,2,6 William A. Goddard III,3Julia R. Greer1,7 Metallic glasses are metallic alloys that exhibit exotic material properties. They may have fractal structures at the atomic level, but a physical mechanism for their organizationwithout ordering has not been identified. We demonstrated a crossover between fractal short-range (<2 atomic diameters) and homogeneous long-range structures using in situ x-ray diffraction, tomography, and molecular dynamics simulations. A specific class offractal, the percolation cluster, explains the structural details for several metallic-glasscompositions. We postulate that atoms percolate in the liquid phase and that the percolating cluster becomes rigid at the glass transition temperature. Freeze a liquid fast enough, and it becomes a glass, a material that is structurally sim- ilar to the liquid but incapable of flow. Thisconcept, albeit not well understood ( 1,2), is so ubiquitous that it holds even for metals (3). Vitrified metals, or metallic glasses, are a class of disordered materials with nondirectionalbonding and possess a suite of lucrative mechan- ical properties, such as high elastic limit and strength ( 4). Unlike most crystalline metals and alloys, metallic glasses earn their name from a lack of long-range atomic order and the absence of typical defects, such as dislocations, renderingtheir microstructure challenging to conceptualize 1306 18 SEPTEMBER trimeric influenza hemagglutinin stem as a broadly This copy is for your personal, non-commercial use only. clicking here. colleagues, clients, or customers by , you can order high-quality copies for your If you wish to distribute this article to others here. following the guidelines can be obtained by Permission to republish or repurpose articles or portions of articles ): September 22, 2015 www.sciencemag.org (this information is current as ofThe following resources related to this article are available online at http://www.sciencemag.org/content/349/6254/1301.full.htmlversion of this article at: including high-resolution figures, can be found in the online Updated information and services, http://www.sciencemag.org/content/suppl/2015/08/24/science.aac7263.DC1.html can be found at: Supporting Online Material http://www.sciencemag.org/content/349/6254/1301.full.html#relatedfound at:can be related to this article A list of selected additional articles on the Science Web sites http://www.sciencemag.org/content/349/6254/1301.full.html#ref-list-1, 23 of which can be accessed free: cites 59 articles This article http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/collection/biochemBiochemistrysubject collections: This article appears in the following registered trademark of AAAS. is aScience 2015 by the American Association for the Advancement of Science; all rights reserved.
