Nancy Lane received the Ph.D. in Religion and Psychology from The Union Institute,Cincinnati, Ohio, and was a Visiting Scholar at Oxford University, England, where she studiedthe meaning of healing and suffering. Dr. Lane received the Master of Divinity from ColgateRochester Divinity School, Rochester, N.Y., and a B.A. in Religion from Wells College, Aurora,N.Y.Ordained in the Episcopal Church in 1984, she served as a diocesan staff officer and Director ofthe Office of Access Ability for the Diocese of Central New York. Dr. Lane later became theExecutive Director of Disability Awareness: An Empowering Ministry. She is known as annational and international speaker on issues of accessibility and disability in the Church and thecommunity, and delivered papers before the World Council of Churches Congress in theNetherlands, the W.C.C. Consultation on Religion and Disability in Uruguay, and theInternational Congress on Pastoral Care and Counseling in Australia. She has lectured atnumerous colleges, seminaries, and conferences within the ecumenical community and for manysecular organizations, including medical schools. Dr. Lane has also preached and led workshopsin several hundred churches across America. For many years she has led a retreat for people0 with disabilities on the Spirituality of Living with a Disability at Kirkridge Retreat Center inBangor, Pa.Dr. Lane is a Jungian-based psychologist, with expertise in treating women with disabilities,battered women and women suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). She is alsotrained in Spiritual Direction.Dr. Lane has written a number of articles on the spirituality of living with disability and is author ofa book on the spiritual and theological implications of the abuse of power toward women with disabilities. INTRODUCTIONThe Rev. Nancy Lane, Ph.D.The materials in this resource book have arisen from my fifteen years of ministry concerned withthe inclusion of people with disabilities in the Christian church. Consequently, the resourcesreflect a Christian perspective. However, I believe that people of other faiths can use some of theresources as springboards for exploring the issues of disability and accessibility in their faithcommunity. Further, it is not necessary to be a Christian to be engaged in theological reflectionon the issues of healing and suffering, the meaning of life, and the presence or absence of God inour experiences.As noted in the page devoted to the Author's Background, my academic studies and myprofessional experiences have been devoted to the theological, spiritual, biblical, hermeneutical,psychological, and practical aspects of the experience of disability. I have read extensively on theissues of healing and suffering as they relate to living as a human being in general and to livingwith a disability or chronic illness in particular. As a Christian and an ordained priest I havefound deep meaning in the life, crucifixion, death, and resurrection of Jesus. As a psychologist Ifind that these are also powerful symbols of the spiritual journey toward healing andtransformation even if one is not a Christian. Thus, you will find the themes of suffering, death,transformation, healing and resurrection running through the materials in this book.I also have the experience of living with cerebral palsy since my birth. This experience has beenrich with the blessings of those who see and accept me as a person who is also gifted and able.Life has been blessed with loving parents, two lovely daughters, and life-long friends. I havebeen able to achieve most of my goals from being a pianist, a dancer, a serious cook andgastronome, mother and grandmother to being a scholar, a writer, and a priest of the Church.Nevertheless, I have also encountered years of discrimination and exclusion in and by theinstitutional church. In my early work as a diocesan staff officer and in the years since then as avolunteer director for Disability Awareness, I answered hundreds of letters and calls frompeople with disabilities who have been excluded from the church because of negative attitudes,\"victim theology\" and architectural and communication barriers. They wrote of the spiritualwounds engendered by exclusion and despaired of God's presence to them. Like them, I havehad to wrestle with this same pain of exclusionof being denied the sacraments, access tocolleagues and a worshipping community, and prevented from being deployed as a priest forthe last ten years. It was within this context that I eventually pulled together the material on\"Spiritual Abuse\" which is among the handouts. The materials gathered there show that myexperience is not unusual; others have written about the pain of exclusion and have repeatedlycalled the church to become welcoming and inclusive. It is my hope that the resources includedhere will be used to open the mind, hearts, and doors of faith communities to people withdisabilities.Just as the experiences of discrimination and exclusion affect our journeys, so do the experiencesof acceptance and affirmation. Whenever I give a workshop, lecture, or lead a retreat I find thatmy voice, my experiences, my gifts and abilities, and my life are affirmed. What I have learnedthrough years of study and wrestling in prayer makes a difference to many people because it affirms their own experiences of living with limitations, disabilities, vulnerabilities, suffering,grace, healing, and faith. People thank me for putting their own experiences into words, for giving a name to the pain and anger of exclusion, for affirming that people still use biblical textsto blame them for their (or their child's) disability. They thank me for affirming that a merciful and loving God does not condemn them.Thus, the published articles, the articles \"Victim Theology\" and \"Changing Attitudes, Creating Awareness\" and the handouts arise out of my years and years of formal study, extensivecorrespondence, lectures and retreats, teaching, work as a psychotherapist, and my ownexperiences of exclusion and inclusion in the Church. Those of us who work in the field of Religion and Disability often write about how important it is for people with disabilities to telltheir stories, and how equally important it is for people in the faith communities to hear and receive our stories. Our stories are a missing but significant part of the ongoing story of the history of God in creation and are a testament to what we can teach others about living in faith inthe midst of the ambiguities of this life.The handouts which are included in this resource are intended for both people with disabilitiesand people wanting to minister with them. The handouts are usually used in conjunction withmy seminary course, workshops, retreats, or lectures. However, most of them can also stand alone as useful resources. The handouts on forgiveness were written in the context of the article ATheology of Anger When Living With a Disability. They are also useful in addressing the variousissues outlined in The Grief Cycle. Many of the handouts also draw on years of reading in theclassics of both western and eastern spirituality. This will be seen more specifically in the handouts which give a definition of healing and a definition of spirituality as used in my writing.Included in this resource booklet is a revised syllabus of a course I taught recently at UnionTheological Seminary in New York city. This was a two credit course, taught once a month forthree months. Given the brevity of class time, there was not time to cover everything that needsto be covered for total ministry. I would add ethics to a full time course because of the continuingbacklash against the ADA and the effects this is having on life and death decisions for peoplewith disabilities. However, the syllabus does attempt to give students an introduction toministry with people with physical and mental disabilities, including mental retardation. The syllabus and the annotated bibliography serve to provide an extensive reference guide forresources that are available to churches.There were two very significant components to this course which verified once again theimportance of narrative and the power of story-telling. One of the assignments was to select a healing (or miracle) story and exegete (explain) it from the perspective of the person beinghealed. Students made their presentations in class and nearly every one was a powerful exampleof what the ministry of Jesus must have been like for those whose lives were changed. The stories came to life as students spoke about their own experience with disability, praying forhealing, and the disability remaining. Unlike listening to a sermon on the healing stories bypreachers who have not examined disability or healing at a deep level, one did not go awayfeeling the healing ministry of Jesus was irrelevant today. The stories of my students were thebiblical stories come to life and they changed each of us who heard them. The second component of the course which involved story-telling was the final reflection paper,using the questions outlined. Students had to grapple with questions of suffering and how theywould minister to or with someone who questions the meaning of life because of disability. Likethe general population, students were in different places in terms of understanding suffering andin asking their own questions. It was very clear, however, that while the problem of sufferingwas a major issue in their thinking (and lives), few of them had found the means (or taken thetime) to engage in deep theological reflection or reading on suffering. Yet, suffering is a fact oflife, whether or not one is disabled. As future clergy persons, they will be called upon often tospeak to the questions of \"why?\" or \"how long?\"A persistent theological and biblical theme that affects people with disabilities and their familiesis that suffering, in whatever form, is \"God's will.\" I have discussed this briefly in the article\"Victim Theology,\" where I have also mentioned how study of the suffering of God has beenvery helpful in attempting to understand the incomprehensible mysteries of suffering and evil inthe world. Just as I will commend future divinity students to read further in the area of sufferingand the suffering of God, I urge you, the reader, to do so as well. The reading may challenge youto expand your understanding of the images of God images that teach us about the depth andbreadth of a loving God who is present with each of us in suffering. The reading will also askyou to enter the mystery of sufferingwhere there may not be any answers but there will betransformation and strength for the continuing journey.You will note that the articles and the handouts reflect the historical, biblical, psychological andmedical distinction between cure and healing. Recent scientific studies on the bodymind/soulunity confirm this distinction. As you live with a disability or chronic illness or minister to thosewho do, reflect carefully on this distinction. When you pray for healing of your self or others, beopen to what it means to be healed. The majority of people living with disability do not want orask for \"fixed\" bodies; they pray for healing of the wounds engendered by discrimination, thebarriers of exclusion, the pain of abuse, and the negative attitudes of our communities andchurches. One can live with a disability or chronic illness and know healing. I pray that readers will find these resources of use in their own spiritual journey as well as inworking to create an inclusive, welcoming, and accessible faith community. ARTICLES:Changing Attitudes, Creating AwarenessandVictim Theology CHANGING ATTITUDES, CREATING AWARENESS This paper highlights several critical areas where churches can begin to understand thebarriers of exclusion to people with disabilities. Several of the hand-outs illuminate howa faith community becomes accessible and inclusive. Our workshops also address theseissues more fully for those who are interested in learning more. ACCESSIBILITY ISSUES\"The current dominant social view in No. America is that people with disabilities andchronic illness should be invisible and powerless.\"1 There is a deafening silence in our faithcommunities about the injustice that people with disabilities continue to face at the end of the21st century. This is compounded by the refusal of the most religious communities tounderstand and accept responsibility for the barriers erected by negative attitudes, inaccessiblebuildings and programs, and an able-bodied theology that is too often abusive to people withdisabilities. Many of the frustrations of people living with disability result because the distancebetween our need for inclusion and access and the religious community is too great. We areconstantly caught up in adjusting to exclusion and the spiritual wounds engendered by it whilethe community fails in their responsibility to become inclusive.2People with disabilities are not only physically excluded but we are psychologically andspiritually alienated from participation in the fullness of life in the faith community.3 HaroldWilke has reminded the Church for several decades that \"The Ramp Is Not Enough!\" The rampmay get you into a building but there is no point in being there if you are not welcome andincluded.The Church has adopted all of society's prejudices of people with disabilities.Negative attitudes exclude people from participation in the community and in theChurch. Negative attitudes include fear, ignorance, patronization, and prejudice all of which\"block people with disabilities from their rightful place within the community.\"4\"These experiences are not simply inconvenience or mere documentation of humaninsensitivity. The right to participation in one's community touches on issues of justiceand ultimately, concerns one's dignity as a child of God. Conversely, exclusion from the The Rev. Nancy Lane, Ph.D. 1 9 community to which one belongs can cause acute suffering and can erode a person'ssense of identity.\"5Exclusion is oppressive and dehumanizing. \"The categories of inclusion and exclusiontouch immediately on a profound current of biblical thought. The root meaning of justice in thebiblical context has to do with right relationships, with the restoration of a situation or environmentwhich promotes equity and harmony in a community (Anchor Bible Dictionary).6 \"A body that despisesor overlooks its own members is an unhealthy body. A church that is not inclusive of peoplewho are disabled is incomplete and is not yet the body of the crucified and risen Christ.\"7In 1978, 21 years ago!, a White House Conference for the Handicapped adopted aresolution which cited the failures of the church to be more welcoming and inclusive:\"religion and religious institutions have marginalized the handicapped, seeing them asobjects of pity and mission only, failing to see them as participating members of the wholefamily of God.\"8In a document written by the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) it was noted that\"Among the clergy as well as the laity, there exists much prejudice, ignorance,indifference, rejection, and misunderstanding of disability. This may well stem from anunawareness of their own or potential disability. Therefore, the clergy and professionalchurch workers need to be educated to a conscious awareness of [the issues ofdisability.] \"9When I began ministry in 1984, I saw very few signs of change in the Church as a result ofthe comprehensive statements of either COCU or the ELCA. People with disabilities are requiredaccept the limitations and problems which disability imposes on them. We are also expected toaccept these discriminatory barriers and negative attitudes. The normative tradition of ourculture, and by extension much of the Church, is that one should be white, male, wealthy,educated, able-bodied, and able-minded. Consequently people without disabilities are notexpected to accept the reality of disability in others, nor the possibility that it will probably affectthem personally. Those within the Church who have attempted to do a ministry around theissues of disability are constantly inundated with reminders of more pressing needs of oppressedgroups, and that disability is not an issue. Thus, there are many people with disabilities whocontinue to be wounded by the spiritual death-making of exclusion in and by the Church. The Rev. Nancy Lane, Ph.D. 1 0 2 The Americans with Disabilities ActThe Church should be a leader in accessibility, integration, and acceptance of all people,yet it has done little to welcome, nurture or sustain people with disabilities. Negative attitudeskeep people away; inaccessible buildings and programs prevent people from entering andparticipating. One cannot participate if shut out by inaccessible architecture within the church orby the lack of appropriate communications for hearing or vision impairments.In 1990 the ADA was passed as a result of the disability-rights movement. This civil-rightslaw was designed to end discrimination and exclusion for 54 million Americans. \"Churcheslobbied for and received blanket exemption from the ADA, Consequently, there are manydenominations which continue to condone the discrimination of people with disabilities. NancyEiesland writes,Many religious bodies have continued to think of and act as if access for peoplewith disabilities is a matter of benevolence and goodwill, rather than aprerequisite for equality and the foundation on which the church as a model ofjustice must rest.1\u00b0 The religious community remains silent about these negative attitudes and theirinsensitivity toward marginalized persons. They are not pro-active for integration andaccessibility for people with disabilities. IT TOOK A LAW to get our rights protected in society,but the religious community was exempt! One religious leader defended this exemption in thisway:[Does] the church needs its own ADA?...Should the church pass such laws? I don't thinkso. You see, churches already have such a law. And churches should guarantee the rightsof all individuals not because of a law but because of THE law. It is called the Law ofLove.11Carter Heyward has written that love requires justice.12 James Nelson says agape loverespects and liberates the other .13 This is the same liberating love which people with disabilitiesseek from faith communities. Yet, the experiences of people with disabilities demonstrates wellthat the liberating love that requires justice and offers healing may be the law of the land but it isnot operative in places of worship. While society has now improved, because of a law, theChurch remains inaccessible and outside the law. They promote the fourth-class (women being The Rev. Nancy Lane, Ph.D. 3 second-class, ethnic minorities third class) citizenship of people with disabilities throughexclusion and \"victim theology.\"Attitudinal and physical barriers allow the religious community to continue practicingoppression, causing the act of worship to be a \"source of frustration, exclusion, and pain.\"14Barriers always convey the \"message that some people are more valuable or worthy than others,that disability equals incompetence and inferiority.\"15 In a just community there would be noinferior people, no barriers, no insensitivity to the subtle forms of oppression being perpetuated.The ADA \"clearly reflects the principles of love and justice which form the foundation of alife of faith.\"16 Voluntary compliance with the principles of the ADA would demonstrate that thereligious community believed in the supreme worth of all of God's people and that all peoplehad equal privileges and responsibilities in the community.17 Further, an ethic of love and justicerequires acceptance of the ADA, for it makes \"illegal that which was immoral.\"18 There are nocredible arguments for ignoring the biblical law of love and justice which would enddiscrimination and exclusion within the religious community. (See characteristics of love.) THEOLOGYThe various theologies of the 90's reflect the cultural and experiential diversity of ourworld in significant ways for bringing needed change to the Church. Yet, the voices of peoplewith disabilities, both in and out of the Church, are absent. Our stories of struggle andoppression are not heard or received. While many theologies address classism, sexism, racism,heterosexism (and homophobia), none of them speak to handicapism. \"Handicapism\" refers tosocietal and institutional oppression and stereotyping, including negative attitudes. Thisomission allows theology to continue setting us apart and treating as different, unequal andinvisible. It remains the task of theology to hear and include the voices of people withdisabilities in the struggle against oppression. I believe Nancy Eiesland and the women whowrote Not All Violins are attempting to do this.Eiesland points out that \"disability has never been religiously neutral, but shot throughwith theological significance,\"19 while Charlotte Caron's book illustrates that \"...many peoplewith disabilities have experienced the church as destructive [and] acknowledge[s] the churches'participation in that evil.\"20 Both books point out that there are many denominations which have The Rev. Nancy Lane, Ph.D. 2 4 a \"theology of access\" or written policies about access but, reject people with disabilities forordination, reflecting an \"institutional double-minded stance [of] discrimination and injustice...\"21Justice, in a religious sense, means that all are created equal. There can be no justice as long as thepower of a few oppresses others. This is a basic denial of human rights22, which always seekjustice and liberation from oppressive conditions.In some of my own writing I have looked to liberation theology which is concerned withjustice and with empowering people. \"A key principle of liberation theology asserts that God ison the side of those who are oppressed and those who do not have power in society.\"23Liberation theology listens to those who suffer at the margins and who speak from the\"underside.\" Black theology also listens to the voices of people who are oppressed anddismantles thepie-in-the-sky-by-and-bytheology of the status quo. I also believe feminist theologyhas much to contribute to a theology of disability but feminists have historically refused toinclude the voices and experiences of women with disabilities.While all of us can point to changes in accessibility and inclusion in society and someplaces within the religious community, \"the prejudice, hostility, and suspicion toward peoplewith disabilities [cannot] be dismissed as relics of an unenlightened past.\"24 Nancy Eiselandnotes, the church has sometimes been a place of inclusion, hope and liberation but, more often ithad devalued and ignored people with disabilities.25 In the meantime, \"the church [continues] tosquander the considerable theological and practical energies of [people] with disabilitieswho...call the church to repentance and transformation.\"26 SPIRITUALITYSpirituality is about our faith development and growth in moving toward God. Disabilityor chronic illness often cause a crisis of faith, yet it can be crisis in which our faith is deepened asa result of our questioning and wrestling with our questions about the meaning of life. We learnalso to live into our questions.Religious roots, traditions, and communities are very important to people who seek toknow God and find the meaning of life. Religion is a source of hope and a sustaining factor in thelives of most human beings. Yet religious communities are places where people with disabilitiesare \"marginalized and drastically oppressed.\"27 Religious communities throughout America The Rev. Nancy Lane, Ph.D. 13 5 \"feel no obligation toward the spiritual needs of [people] with disabilities and seem oblivious totheir omission.\"28 Contrast this omission with the words of Morton Kelsey: \"God's action is theperfect expression of love. It is a mixture of concern, caring, and action. When we love, weparticipate in God's way of reaching out to humankind.\"29 God's love is inclusive; it reaches outto everyone.Religious traditions help people find meaning and hope for their lives, but when we areshut out of the faith community, the search for hope and meaning often turns to needlessdespair. Charlotte Caron writes \"Often we want to find hope but, in fact, despair prevails. Welose hope at certain points in our lives when we cannot see a future for ourselves.\"30 Whenpeople with disabilities are alienated from their religious tradition, emptiness and pain stand inthe place of soul and spirit. That pain is exacerbated by the soul pain of rejection, isolation,powerlessness, and oppression. Oppression hurts at a very personal level, for it is death-makingto the soul.One of the more difficult aspects of living with disability is the way society handlessuffering, loss, grief and disability. Disability is not accepted as one of the many realities of life.The reality of human experience is that we live in a world where there is chaos, death,destruction, grief, loss, and disability. In general, society treats nearly all forms of physical,mental, and emotional disability as unacceptable. Consequently, the burden of acceptanceisplaced on those who are disabled. People with disabilities are expected to live with theirdisability and accept the barriers and limitations of people who find it difficult to accept orinclude us in the life of the community.Disability is affected, for better or worse, by the spiritual dimensions of one's life. Thepain of being disabled is exacerbated by the pain of rejection and struggle caused by negativeattitudes toward us. The soul-pain of coming up against negative attitudes on a daily basismagnifies physical pain. When pain dominates body and soul, the need for the reconciling andhealing love of others becomes critical. Yet, many faith communities fail to offer or provide thishealing love. Consequently, people in pain often experience \"abandonment by God\" andisolation from the faith community. Too often, they decide that disability, loss, and griefinvalidate any possibility of belief in God.31 The Rev. Nancy Lane, Ph.D. 1 4 6 Fr. Donald Senior, who leads a Bible Study tour to Israel for people with disabilities,writes about the suffering brought on by negative attitudes. \"Very often the suffering [people]with disabilities experience is not due to jthe disability itself],... Much of the acute sufferingconnected with...disability comes from the reactions of able-bodied [people] who treat them asless than human, or worse, ignore them altogether.\"32 Exclusion diminishes people. It is \"oftenmore de-humanizing and painful than [the] disability itself.\" It is a form of suffering we do notchoose, but are left to bear alone.33 ANGER AND ANGER AT GODThe problems related to living with a disability are not created in isolation but within thevery real context of the political and economic systems. These systems work to oppress andsuppress the lives and voices of people living with disabilities. Only as we express appropriaterage at these systems will we be liberated. \"Physical access and attitudinal acceptance form basicprerequisites for justice and liberation of [people] with disabilities.\"34Martin Luther King saidthat freedom was never voluntarily given by the oppressor, but that it must be demanded by theoppressed.Having said all of this, we must turn to the use of anger to address the issues of injustice.Many of people with disabilities have known that feeling of hopeless rage at the barriers andprejudices of discrimination. Our anger at these forms of oppression must not be denied. It is asign of hope and faith, for anger which confronts the issues causes a tension which is necessaryfor creative change. You may well encounter a person with a disability who is angry and whohas been labeled angry which usually means \"pay no attention.\" Labeling someone as angry isa convenient way to dismiss their concerns and to ignore their demands to be taken seriously.Beverly Harrison writes that \"Anger directly expressed is a mode of taking the other seriously.\"35Too often it is we who are not taken seriously so it is difficult for our anger to be heard andunderstood as necessary for our inclusion.When anger is because of oppression and social injustice, we usually feel alienated fromothers. However, failure to express our anger at the injustices which threaten the quality of ourlives results in apathy and diminishment of who we are.36 People tend to feel angry and guiltywhen the oppressed \"spill their guts.\" It requires courage and boldness to confront with honesty The Rev. Nancy Lane, Ph.D. 157 and clarity the injustices which undermine our lives. This is a place where expressing our angerto God can protect us from apathy. (I have written about anger at God in one of my articleswhich is in the handbook.)Much of the injustice we face is created and sustained by political structures. It is difficultto address an entire system in an effort to create change and effect justice. Personalcommunication usually has no effect, and political communication by persons with disabilitieshas brought too little too late for too many. We can use our anger in positive ways to insist uponchange by seeking love and not destruction. This is the hard path as it makes no concessions toinjustice and requires a spiritual discipline which will keep us from becoming the oppressor....anger can often reflect the human capacity to transcend the immediate situation,gain a new perspective and effect a change for the better, or...at least register aprotest at the wrongness of that which cannot be changed.37\"The gospel of anger\" can be found in the anger of Jesus, who sided with the rejected ofsociety and who spoke out fearlessly against the authorities. Jesus had no patience with thosewhose piety overlooked justice and mercy. His anger was to speak truth to falsehood andhypocrisy. The gospel of anger is about truth, love and justice.38 This is anger which identifiesand articulates clearly what is needed. It speaks out of love and seeks to bring change where it isneeded.People with disabilities experience considerable anger because they have to \"expend somuch energy and emotion as [they] struggle for what so many people accept with unconsciousease.\"39 We are often angry because the necessary changes for inclusion in the Church occur veryslowly or not at al1.40 Our anger is real but there are few safe places for expressing it. Anger inpeople with disabilities is regarded as a problem, a symptom of numerous disorders. TheChurch compounds this by corresponding anger with sin, rather than seeing anger as a healthyemotion that needs appropriate expression.41Religious communities seldom address the sins of negative attitudes and injustice towardus, so people with disabilities remain excluded, angry and hurt. The anger of people withdisabilities is rarely accepted. Our anger is ignored, denied, or silenced by those who tell us howwe should feel and behave. This mis-understood anger then becomes another reason for The Rev. Nancy Lane, Ph.D. 1 6 8 excluding or labeling us. Our society controls marginalized people by blaming the victim, anddis-empowering them by declaring their behavior as aberrant.If we identify many of the sources of our anger from prejudice, discrimination and denialof our rights, we have three choices: \"remain silent, leave, or confront.\"42 Confrontation has ahigh price, but these struggles are often necessary in order to eliminate the barriers which areplaced in our way and which exclude us from full participation in life.Anger can be creative when used to bring needed change, or it can be destructive if weturn it inward and succumb to the silence and invisibility that is demanded of us by oppressivestructures. There are also other reasons for anger in people with disabilities, including the angerthat comes with loss and grief. Many of those losses are caused by the barriers of exclusion anddiscrimination but, if we identify these losses and express our grief, we are labeled angry.Anger, grief, and depression are major spiritual issues in the lives of those withdisabilities but we rarely find spiritual help from the religious community in learning how tomove through these experiences. There are spiritual issues which the religious communityaddresses in the lives of non-disabled people. However, they remain ignored in the lives ofpeople with disabilities because non-disabled people are uncomfortable when we express thepain and anger of injustice and oppression. If people of faith were to listen and hear ourfrustration, they would inevitably be to led to action--action that would ask them to examinetheir own attitudes, challenge the attitudes of those close to them, and then to work to eliminatethe barriers that contributed to our pain and loss. Currently religious communities find it ispolitically correct to end the suffering of many oppressed peoples in this and other countries,and this is important and necessary ministry. However, it is still not politically correct to hear thevoices of people with disabilities and address the barriers which continue to be death-making toour souls, but this, too is a necessary and important ministry.Anger that is trivialized, medicalized, or silenced turns to despair and depression. Peoplewith disabilities live with lengthy and recurring periods of depression. Non-acceptance of whowe are, our feelings or our reality is death-making to our souls. It isolates us, denies ourhumanity, and leaves us frustrated... and angry. This may cause one to be locked into a viciouscycle that leads to destructive behaviors and/or depression and hopelessness. The Rev. Nancy Lane, Ph.D. 17 9 What many of us forget, or fail to understand, is that anger is a choice we make whenfaced with the struggles of living. It is a chosen reaction to humiliation.43 For persons living witha disability, it may be the only appropriate choice in the face of negative attitudes and barriers ofdiscrimination. Whenever we are prevented from achieving our goals and desires, we arefrustrated and have a need to change the situation. The emotional response to frustration isanger. A response to a threat or to frustration causes bodily change, thus we feel angry.\" We feelanger as a reaction to injustice or frustration. Anger that we feel has the power to transform andheal our lives if we acknowledge its' presence and purpose in our lives.* Anger denied prevents us from being part of a community.* When we hide anger, we lose the power to Be, to act, and to love.* Anger is a protest against being treated as less than equal.* Anger expressed is a way of asking to be taken seriously.* Anger heard is being taken seriously.* Anger is a normal reaction to injustice or frustration.Anger is a powerful spiritual resource for people with disabilities because anger is amotivating force for necessary change. \"Action to change structures that perpetuate the violenceof [any prejudice and discrimination] is essential for those who profess a liberationist faith anddesire a just world.\"44 William Sloan Coffin reminds us that \"Anger keeps [us] from toleratingthe intolerable.\"45 Anger is the energy which promotes justice and pushes us toward growth.People with disabilities question everything through entering into the struggle andexploring the rough places in the spiritual journey. Our questions keep us going. Sometimes wegain insight and wisdom; other times we ask new questions and continue the journey. We areoften angry, but our anger empowers us to seek justice, confront evil, to wrestle with God anddemand a blessing.46 Expressing our anger in a community of faith where it is heard andreceived would enable all of us to gain health. CONCLUSIONSThe religious community must change its attitude toward people with disabilities or theywill continue to be devalued. Devalued people are treated badly; they are rejected, abused, andconsidered unworthy for time and friendship, thus causing further marginalization. They The Rev. Nancy Lane, Ph.D. 18 10 become objects of pity, subjects of charity, and treated in ways which diminish their dignity,growth, competence, health, finances, and their quality of life. There are too many who continueto regard us as brave or courageous at one end, or worthy of pity at the other end. Neitherextreme allows for understanding or acceptance of us as human beings in the same struggle.Every human society has scapegoated and marginalized some group of people. Thevision of a whole human community still challenges us: a family of God in which the stranger iswelcome and treated with justice and integrity. The religious community cannot exemplify theImago Dei or bear witness to the interdependence of human beings as long as we exclude peoplewith disabilities. When we marginalize, exclude or distance ourselves from others, we narrowour own boundaries and foreshorten our own vision.47The religious community has much to learn from people who live with disabilities. Ibelieve that those of us who understand suffering and who have moved into and through it, caninform the religious community in ways which will transform it. Charlotte Caron reminds thefaith community thatIt is not always easy to survive and the power and passion that keeps us survivingis not to be minimized. The endurance that enables survival reflects an importantspiritual resource... This resource exhibits moral strength and spiritual courage... 48 END NOTES 1Charlotte Caron in Not All Violins: Spiritual Resources by Women with Disabilities and Chronic Illnesses.

Nancy Lane, Ph.D.21 13 VICTIM THEOLOGY Most of my ministry has been concerned with the issues of healing and disability.The majority of people with disabilities whom I talk with or who writeme haveexperienced spiritual trauma from Christians who continue to use biblical and theologicalissues to blame and victimize persons with disabilities: 1) your faith has not made youwell; 2) you are demon possessed; 3) whose sin is it that you were born disabled?; 4)suffering is God's will; and 5) the blemished shall not approach the altar;1 These verses areused to judge, dismiss, and dis-empower us, usually shutting us out of the religiouscommunity. They also place the burden for healing on the person who is disabled,causing further suffering and continued alienation from faith communities. This is what Icall \"victim theology.\" In this paper I will attempt to set out how these scriptures areused and how such use reflects a \"victim theology.\" 2Many well-meaning religious people encourage people with disabilities to \"beartheir cross\" or to \"offer it up.\" While these can be authentic religious responses for thoseon the spiritual journey, they are not welcome or healing responses to people withdisabilities who are asking for inclusion and for recognition of their abilities within thefaith community. A more appropriate, life-giving response would involve listening to ourstories and responding by working with us to change attitudes. Religious leaders who \u00a9 1992 This material mati not be reprobuceb or useb without author's permission.The Rev.NandiLAW, M.D. 221 have studied scriptures know that God is the author of the \"impossible\" and the\"miraculous\"--a boundary-breaking God who offers access toeveryone, Jew and Gentile,able-bodied and disabled.3 Thus, it is all the more disturbing to know that religiousleaders are frequently the defenders of limitations, barriers, and negative attitudes.Rebecca Chopp says that \"...physical afflictions become elevated to virtuous sufferingwhen... they can be spoken of as trials of obedience. Such teachings allow either one oftwo options for those with disabilities: miraculous healing or heroic suffering.\"4 Neither ofthese options are acceptable to people with disabilities.I. Faith healing:There are many faith-healers out there pronouncing that people who are nothealed lack faith. Many healing services continue to suggest that physical and mentalimperfections are the effect of sin, or that disability reflects evil. There are also those whoimply that persons with disabilities chose to suffer, or that \"disabilities are merely thephysical manifestation of imperfections of the soul. \"3 Such pronouncements are spiritualabuse. \"Spiritual abuse is the act of denying people considered disabled their fullhumanity. It is to treat and care for them as if they were less than human.\"6 Exclusionproduces spiritual wounds:anger, low self-esteem, \"...a sense of meaninglessness,despair, even loss of faith.\" While many people are vulnerable to these feelings, \"...we are 2 \u00a9 1992 This material mmi not be reprobuceb or useb without author's permission. The Rev. Nroicti Uwe, Ph.D. 23 more...likely to experience spiritual pain directly connected to our [living with] adisability, and we have a right to turn to theology for healing.\"7Healing in the early Church involved the laying on of hands. This continues to be apowerful ministry of healing when the community lives in faith that God's will be done.The efficacy of prayer and caring also have healing effects on people. To care for anotheris to understand, listen to and accept the person you are praying for. When people areaccepted as they are, they are empowered to move toward wholeness. Wholeness doesnot always mean that disability or illness will be removed from our midst. When peopleare accepted as they are, they are empowered to move toward wholeness. The healingministry of Jesus was concerned with the whole person: body, mind, and spirit. Thismeaning has been obscured wherever persons with disabilities become \"victims\" ofhealing rather than persons whose lives are healed.Healing occurs in many ways and at many levels of an individual. Likewise,illness and disability occur at levels within us beyond the reach of medicine. The earlychurch saw healing as a sacrament. People seeking healing went to confession and soughtforgiveness before being anointed in healing service. One entered into the sacrament ofhealing with a contrite heart and a deep intentionality toward God's will. Today, it isoften not God's will which is prayed for but the will of others who decide that healing willmean our disability will disappear. This becomes another form of oppression as it pushes \u00a9 1992 This inAtcrial niati not be reprobuceb or web without author's permission.TheRev.NAticmLame, Ph.D. 243 us back into the guilt, shame and fear of stigma. This is death-making to the soul seekinga spiritual life.There are many people who interpret faith as the prerequisite for removing thedisability, which is entirely different than being healed. They are obsessed with wantingdisabled bodies to be \"healed,\" meaning fixed, turned into something society defines as\"normal\" because disability is seen as a basic flaw rather than a human variation. Theprayers of these people place the burden of \"healing\" on people with the disabilities.Healing is expected to change the person with a disability into someone without a visibledisability. Physical healing is not what most people with disabilities desire. Rather, it isspiritual and emotional healing---acceptance, respect, inclusion and opportunity.Even the gospel stories suggest the distinction between curing and healing.Donald Senior, a New Testament scholar who writes about religion and disability says\"I use the term cure in a strict physical sense, referring to physical transformationby which, for example, the withered arm of the man in the synagogue of Capernum ismade straight. Healing hasa more profound and comprehensive meaning, referring notonly to physical transformation but to a profound spiritual transformation as well. Not all peopleeven in the drama of the Gospels have access to cure; but allare invited to be healed. Even Jesus himself, one could say, would ultimately not experience cure butwould be healed through the experience of resurrection.\"8 There is a distinction between healing and curing. Healing \"represents a conditionof one's life; \"cured\" relates strictly to one's physical condition.\"9 Healing is a continuingprocess leading one to wholeness and integration. The world \"health\" comes from a root 4\u00a9 1992 This material mats not be reprobuceb or uses without author's permission. The Rev. Neoicti Lane, Ph.D. word meaning \"whole.\" Wholeness, or health, is not just an absence of illness ordisability, it is a way of living.\"10 To be healthy or whole is to be integrated and at peacewith oneself.11Wholeness is founded upon the transformation of our whole being--ofour spiritual and psychological self, of our way of living in the world. Healing is notalways about being free of illness or disability. It is often about letting go of falseexpectations and unrealistic hopes or dreams and becoming all you can be. Healingallows us to live with disability rather than suffer from it.II. Disability reflects evil.\"The New Testament knows two different forms of illness. First, there ispossession by an evil spirit, which has robbed the person concerned of his or her self, orcentre. Secondly, there are various illnesses which are really called weaknesses, in whichthe inner centre of a person's power has been disturbed.12Religious tradition has regarded people with disabilities as \"either divinely blessedor damned: the defiled evildoer or the spiritual superhero.\"13 Neither characterization\"adequately represents the ordinary lives and lived realities of most people withdisabilities.\"14 Christine Smith points out that is especially true for women withdisabilities, whose bodies \"are the enemy and that the way to escape them is to transcendthem spiritually.\"15 \"...theology that encourages us to ignore our bodily experiences and tohate our bodies is not constructive. [The women in Caron's book write] \"We are appalled \u00a9 1992 This material coati not be reprobuceb or used without author's permissiou.The Rev. Nmat Large, Ph.D. 26 by the idea of a God who might see us as evil simply because we are women withdisabilities... unable to live apart from the concrete existence we have here and now\"(Caron 26).Literature often portrays public responses to the sight of persons with disabilitiesin ways which suggest the person represents evil or sin. Consequently, there are manywho see deformities as punishment for sin. These attitudes cause people with disabilitiesto become victims or scapegoats. Victims become scapegoats because they are perceivedas a threat to all that had been defined as \"normal\" by the culture.16Telling people that disability is the result of sin is a form of scapegoating. Rene _Girard's treatment of the scapegoat shows that, historically, people with disabilities havebeen the primary scapegoats in our culture. Scapegoating is also a projection of the sinagainst us that goes unchecked. \"Sin is the collective attitude of our society that rewardspower, violence, betrayal of trust, lies, threats and violation of persons. ... Sin is revealedby a society that does not value persons, destroys creation, and uses power and privilegedestructively.\"17 Violence against people with disabilities, and in particular women, isepidemic. Some statistics show that 90-95% of women with disabilities are abused andraped. They are rarely believed and few, if any, services are available to them because ofnegative stereotyping. The sins of those who betray, violate and abuse people withdisabilities are not identified and no one is held accountable. The religious community 6\u00a9 1992 This material marl not be reprobuceb or use, without author's permission.The Rev.NAtial Laic, 27 should be standing with us in identifying these sins of oppression and injustice, workingwith us to seek justice, and praying with us for healing of the deep wounds. Instead, thereis a deafening silence and it is death-making to the lives of those left to suffer alone.III. Disability reflects sin:In the gospel of John, the question is asked of Jesus, \"whose sin is it?\"18 This verse isoften cited as proof that God's will takes the form of punishment brought on by theperson or by the parents. Many of us would quickly reply that we do not accept thistheology. Yet, the birth of a child who is disabled or the occasion of a late onset disabilitybrings forth a common question: what did I do to deserve this?19 Even if these people areable to move beyond self-blame, the church reinforces this viewpoint with its theology ofvictimization--\"if you have enough faith you would be healed.\"The disciples were attempting to blame the man's blindness on him or his parents.This attitude relieved them of the need to respond to the man born blind in ways whichheal. The disciple's failed to express their faith or that God was at work through them.Jesus did the work of faith and healing when he responded that no one sinned, thuslifting one of the many burdens projected on to persons with disabilities. Jesus says thatthe man born blind has the opportunity to express his FAITH by demonstrating that God is at work in his life.IV. Suffering is Ph.D. This view holds that disability is God's will, that God is the author of suffering inorder to get our attention. This view suggests an avenging God, a selfish God, amanipulating God-- images which are not useful to people living with disability. Theconcept of virtuous suffering is \"used to promote adjustment to unjust social situationsand to sanction isolation among people with disabilities... [it] encourages people withdisabilities to acquiesce to social barriers as a sign of obedience to God and to internalizesecond-class status inside and outside the church.\"20Another theme of suffering stresses the goodness of the one who is disabled andencourages them to bear their suffering as they will be rewarded in heaven. This is \"pie-in-the-sky-by-and-by\" theology, intended to silence complaints or expressions of need.This is also a theology of oppression, which marginalizes people with disabilities andrenders them invisible. This theology is used by the powerful to \"silence the voices of thepowerless and maintain the positions of the powerful.\"21There are many people who suggest that God gives pain and suffering as a way tofind meaning in life. Whenever theology or New Age philosophy are used to providevapid answers to complex issues, God and the spiritual quest for understanding aretrivialized and there is victim blaming. For the last several years I have studiedextensively the suffering of God as found in both Christian and Jewish literature. Thisreading has enabled me to understand the suffering and death of Jesus in ways which 8\u00a91992 This material mad not be reprobuceb or used without author's -permission.The Rev. Nroicti La lie, 29 liberated me from the trite advice that disability, oppression, injustice, andmarginalization were my \"cross to bear.\" Instead I discovered the deeper truth of ElieWeisel's story about the child who was hung in the courtyard of their prison camp. Hisneighbor asked him, \"where is your God now?' Weisel answered, \"There. God hangs therewith the child.\" There are those who think Weisel despaired of God at this point. For me, it is a vivid reminder of God's suffering and of God's presence in human suffering.The image of the \"crucified God\" expresses the suffering-love of God. Whitehead calls God \"the suffering companion who understands.\" In order to understand our reality, and be present to us, God suffers with us. The God who suffers is thus a God who isdisabled. God enters into our reality in order to know it. The image of a \"disabled God\" is meant to remind us that God's power is limited, thus God is able to be disabled, and tosuffer. Burton Cooper writes that \"Jesus on the cross is God disabled, made weak andvulnerable to worldly powers because of the perfection of divine love.\"22Viktor Frankel's book, Man's Search for Meaning, is a classic example of how people found meaning in the aftermath of the most meaningless and senseless suffering the world has known. Frankel demonstrates with his life that deep faith and spiritualconnectedness to God enable one to grapple with meaninglessness and find the strength and courage to enter the mystery of suffering, and find God. This is theology that does not blame God or others for suffering. Rather, this is a theology that says we are not left \u00a9 1992 This material rnam not be Author's permission.The Rev. NAricti Lace, MD.9 alone to suffer. God is with us, and in embracing both God and life as it is, we will growdeeper in our understanding of God's will for our lives.Life with a disability is not all suffering. Nevertheless, those of us who live withdisability, who have plumbed the depths of our experiences of grace and limitation, ofloss and survival, of grief and joy, of oppression and crying out, have much to bring to thetheology and spirituality of seeking, finding, and knowing God. It is simply of matter ofacceptance and inclusion, of being welcomed into the community, where our stories andexperiences are heard and received as part of the ongoing history of God in the world.Charlotte Caron suggests that our endurance is a spiritual resource which others can learn from:...endurance shows that the human spirit is tough, that it will hang on andnot say no. Endurance enables people to lead complex and meaningful livesin the midst of incredibly dehumanizing conditions. ...[Our ability to hangon] shows a self exercising responsibility, a self of often tremendous moralcourage.23V. Disability as mission for charity.The fifth theological interpretation of disability is that of mission. People withdisabilities are regarded as objects, in need of charity. Charity \"neglect[s] the social andpolitical needs of people with disabilities\"24 and leaves them further isolated in thestruggle to find inclusion. When you are the object of charity, others decide what youneed and assume that they know what is best for you. You are not allowed to articulate 10\u00a9 1992 This material mam not be reprobuccb or uscb without Author's permission.The Rev. Neoicsi 31 your real needs or to have a say in decision-making about your life. Objectifying peoplewith disabilities is a political act because it is a way of controlling us and it prevents usfrom being seen as real \"people with interests, opinions, needs, desires, emotions orexpectations.\"25 Nancy Eiesland writesAs long as disability is addressed in terms of the themes of sin-disabilityconflation, virtuous suffering, or charitable action, it will be seen primarilyas a fate to be avoided, a tragedy to be explained, or a cause to bechampioned rather than an ordinary life to be lived. As long as disability isunaddressed theologically or addressed only as a special interestperspective, the Christian church will continue to propagate a double-minded stance that holds up the disabled as objects of ministry andadulation for overcoming the very barriers that the church has helped toconstruct.26 CONCLUSIONSThe stories of healing in the New Testament are stories that need to beappropriated by each of us as our own healings. Jesus heals the whole person, their placein life and in the community, and helps them to find their own way of life. When Jesusraises the sick, \"health, life and confirmation of their being were restored to them.\"27 They were no longer solelydependent on others but became their own person, with their ownlanguage, dignity and their own story.28Healing in the NT has far-reaching consequences, extending well beyond beingable to hear, see, talk or walk again. Rather, one finds support and is able to stand again, \u00a9 1992 This niAteriA mast not be reprobuceb or used without author's permission.The Rev. Naliai Lam, M.D. 3211 social relations are restored, patriarchal exclusions are broken, peace is bestowed, andrighteousness is achieved (forgiveness of sins).People who live with disabilities and/or chronic illnesses and who haveexperienced healing in some way often experience conflict with \"healthy\" people.Healing transforms people and sometimes other people may not recognize thetransformation. They do not know that the person who has been healed has been on ajourney that has been life-changing.29 We see this in many of the Gospel stories where theperson who has been healed is instructed to go and show him or her self to the priestwho had the power to declare a person clean and could permit their return to thecommunity. The power of prayer and the sacrament of healing are intended to restore usto wholeness. Wholeness does not always mean that one's disability or illness will beremoved. It does mean that we learn to find meaning in them, and integrating ourexperience into the totality of our life. We do live with disability, and that should be themessage of a lived out hope. Faith lived out may be most visible in persons withdisabilities who endure the struggles, accept the challenges, and continue to face life in allits ambiguity.Those of us who live with disability, who have plumbed the depths of ourexperiences of grace and limitation, of loss and survival, of grief and joy, of oppressionand crying out, have much to bring to the theology and spirituality of seeking, finding, 12\u00a9 1992 This material coati not be author's permission.The Rev. Nana' Larie, Ph.D. 33 and knowing God. It is simply of matter of acceptance and inclusion, of being welcomedinto the community, where our stories and experiences are heard and received as part ofthe ongoing history of God in the world.Walter Wink has written that the world is divided into two groups: \"those who areaware of their disabilities and those who are blind to them. Those who are moreobviously disabled or who have been forced by life to come to terms with their disabilitieshave a prophetic task to play in awakening [others] to the uniqueness of who we areunder God.\" Wink suggests that others may discover their \"own most divinepossibilities\" by turning to us \"for guidance, leadership and wisdom.\"30If you are a person with a disability, tell your story to your faith community,persisting until you are heard. Telling our stories is holy work; it is making sacred thatwhich has been painful for too long. If you are a person without a disability, findopportunities to listen to our stories in your community. Encourage people withdisabilities to be visible and work with others to make your community a welcoming andhealing place for all people, a place where God's love, mercy and justice counteract allinjustice and victim theology.

Ph.D. Seminary Course Syllabus 37 Disability, Spirituality and Healing: Theological, Spiritual andBiblical Perspectives for Ministry. Dr. Nancy Lane INTRODUCTION TO THE COURSEThis course is designed to prepare students to minister with people with disabilities in a \"caring andinclusive\" church community. To be welcoming and inclusive usually requires the personal andcommunal transformation of individuals as well as institutions. Transformation is about shiftingattention from diversity to inclusivity, from segregation to integration, from counter-dependenceto interdependence.There are well over forty million Americans with some disabling condition in America, with adiversity of social and pastoral needs. This means that one in four church members are disabledor have a family member who is disabled. However, this 25% of church members are often invisibleor absent from congregational life. People with disabilities are often overlooked in parish ministrybecause of this \"invisibility.\"Their need for access to the community of faith is rarelyunderstood or addressed. The Church has been one of the most resistant institutions inbecoming accessible. Too often access is defined as architectural adaptation, rather than beingproperly understood as an issue of faith and justicerequiring an attitude of welcome andinclusion.Attitudes cannot be legislated. However, our theology is reflected in the ways in which we liveout our faithwhich is further reflected in our attitudes toward people who are categorized as\"different\" in our society. \"Attitude adjustment\" is never a simple matter as human beings areformed by the beliefs, attitudes, and fears of family and friends, as well as their own lifeexperiences. These contributing factors often include the myths and negative images andattitudes of our culture toward people with disabilities. We will explore the biblical, theological, spiritual, liturgical, hermeneutical and pastoral careissues associated with ministry with people with disabilities and their inclusion in the faithcommunity. Students will examine the issues of access (attitudes, communications and architecture)to gain understanding of the social resistance to inclusion. Old and New Testament scriptures will beexamined as a means of reflecting on contemporary theological-pastoral attitudes about disability. Wewill look at several of the gospel healing stories from the perspective of people with disabilitiesand people who have been healed. We will analyze the relationship between faith and healing(both in traditional thinking and in the current literature related to studies of the bodymindconnection), issues of healing vs. cure, illness vs. disease, and the emerging theologies ofdisability. We will focus on (1) the roles of faith, spirituality, prayer, and healing as it relates to issues of disability,(2) the theological and psycho-spiritual issues of living with disability and, (3) how theology, ministryand scriptures impact these issues. Areas to be examined also include: the cycle of grief anddepression as stages of death and resurrection; a theology of anger as social protest and faithdevelopment; the meaning of suffering and healing in the spiritual journey; finding God's strength inweakness; healing, wholeness and transformation vs. curing. Class texts and resources will includeautobiographical, theological, psycho-spiritual and literary writings and films. Disability, Spirituality and Healing: Theological, Spiritual and Biblical Perspectives for Ministry. 1Dr. Nancy Lane38 Course Content The focus of this course will be concerned with biblical, theological, pastoral, and practicalaspects of ministry.Accessibility: Attitudinal and ArchitecturalA theology of ministry with people with disabilities.Pastoral care with people with disabilities or their families.Spirituality and disability.Healing and disability.A theology of sufferingDeveloping sensitivity to the language of disability and the labels of our culture.Ethical issues (if we have time).Components of this course will include both lecture/didactic, experiential, and theologicalreflection. The theological reflection will occur both in class and through journal writings. Theintention is for students to integrate the didactic and experiential components for the purposes ofministry and pastoral care.The issues of disability are very important to anyone in ministry. How one treats people withdisabilities and how a parish includes and welcomes them tells much about how we live out theGospel message. Secondly, ministry always involves being present to the pain, suffering, andvulnerability of our parishioners. If we are afraid of our own vulnerability and limitations, then wewill be uncomfortable and unavailable to the experience of others. Thus, this course is not abouta marginal ministry but, rather, is a significant paradigm of ministry. Wrestling with the issues ofdisability, suffering, and healing, is to wrestle with the very human questions about the meaningof life.While this course can be seen as an area of \"specialized ministry,\" our intention is to highlightthe central questions and issues ministry in general. We intend to interface the issues of ministrywith the more general issues of disability. These issues will be placed within a theologicalcontext for the purposes of understanding suffering, healing and spiritualityfor those with whomyou minister and for yourself. Theological reflection will be used as a means of integrating thisunderstanding in your daily life; that is, you are expected to gain more than a purely intellectualunderstanding from the content of this course.Due to the brevity of this course, we will not be dealing with specific disabilities. The readingscover the experiences of people with a variety of disabilities. When I refer to disability I ambeing inclusive of persons with major, chronic illnesses; physical, mental, and emotionaldisabilities; vision and hearing impairments. I am not referring to people who are alcoholic, HIVinfected, obese, anorexic, or dealing with phobias. This is not meant to minimize in any way theseriousness of those issues: Rather, this course is designed to deal with disabilities asunderstood in the biblical-historical contextdisabilities which have historically been seen as theresult of sin, evil, or demonic possession. A note regarding Deaf people is also made under theassignments.Secondly, there are a wide range of issues which could be dealt with in a course on disabilityranging from Christian Education issues to guardianship to ethical considerations. Since it isimpossible to cover everything in our brief time together, I have chosen to address the morefundamental issues of ministry and theologyhow we understand God's will and how God worksin and through suffering, illness, disease, spiritual life, and healing. This includes getting at theaffective aspects of this coursewhat are your feelings as you read, see a film, and interactwith people with disabilities? How do these feelings affect your understanding of ministry andhow will they inform your ministry? Disability, Spirituality and Healing: Theological, Spiritual and Biblical Perspectives for Ministry.Dr. Nancy Lane392 COURSE OBJECTIVES1.To understand how the risen Christ embodies the brokenness of people who live withdisabilities, disease or chronic illness. 2.To recognize why the Body of Christ is incomplete wherever people with disabilities are notincluded. 3.To understand the healing texts of the gospels from the perspective of healing and peoplewith disabilities. 4.To be able to incorporate ideas and strategies for ministry that will enable you to developinclusive and welcoming faith communities wherever you serve. 5.To be able to identify people with disabilities in your own faith community and in institutionswhere you study or work. 6.To be able to help people find meaning and purpose in life in the midst of loss and suffering. 7.To integrate the learning from this course in ways which prepare you for a pastoral ministryof presence. 8.To foster your academic, professional, spiritual and personal growth.

Experiential component - WRITTEN PAPER. This component is intended to help studentsbridge theory and practice so that they are able to integrate concern for the place and care ofpeople with disabilities into their understanding of parish ministry. This is ONE assignment.Read each of the following criteria carefully and write ONE paper on your visit to a churchand your interview with a person with a disability.A. Visit a church which is involved with ministry with people with disabilities forthe purposes of gaining an understanding of how various churches have addressed theissues of accessibility, inclusion, and welcome. This will also give you an opportunity tobe in touch with your feelings, assumptions, and any stereotypes about people withdisabilities.If your visit is to another parish other than your own, can you describe how your ownfaith community ministers with people with disabilities:Are they active participants in the full life of the church?Are there separate, special programs? If so, do you know why?Is your church welcoming and inclusive in their attitudes?Is your church accessible? In what ways? What more needs to be done? Why do youthink it has not been done? B.Interview and listen to the stories of one or more people with a disability; comparethem to your story; seek the common ground in our stories.A NOTE ABOUT DISABILITIES WHICH QUALIFY FOR THISINTERVIEW. READ CAREFULLY.1. The person must have a disability which has interfered withnormal access to thechurch/synagogue and/or tofull participation in the life of the community: someone in awheelchair, or who uses a walker, braces, cane; someone withmental illness (not an anxiety or panic disorder); someone who isdevelopmentally disabled; someone who is blind; someone who iselderly and finds it difficult to access the building, read thebulletin, or hear the service.2. Unless you are Deaf orHearing-Impaired, please donot interview someone who is. People who are Deaf do not consider themselvesdisabled. This is a cultural issue for them. Youmay have to inquire from the church who to interview. The pastor or others may tellyou they have no one who is disabled in their church. Check with the church secretary:s/he will probably know of someone who stopped coming because of a disablingcondition. Remember that one-fourth of every congregation is disabled in someway and are probably invisible because of access/attitudinal issues.C. Write an informal 4-5 page paper about:Your Church visit.Your interviewanswering as many of the questions listed below aspossible.Your pastoral response to any issues which you identify in the church'saccessibility or in the interview.Due the first week after mid-term break.Disability, Spirituality and Healing: Theological, Spiritual and Biblical Perspectives for Ministry.Dr. Nancy Lane458 QUESTIONS TO CONSIDER FOR YOUR CHURCH VISIT:Is the church accessible? In what ways? Is anything more needed?If it is not accessible, what is the attitude toward making it accessible?Are people with disabilities active participants in worship and the life of the community?If your visit was to another parish other than your own, can you describe how your own faithcommunity ministers with people with disabilities:Are they active participants in the full life of the church?Are there separate, special programs? If so, do you know why?Is your church welcoming and inclusive in their attitudes?Is your church accessible? In what ways? What more needs to be done? Why do youthink it has not been done?QUESTIONS TO CONSIDER FOR YOUR INTERVIEW:D How do their stories enable you to see God in the person with a disability?D How has their spirituality been affected by their experiences of church or faith?What were the issues of their lives that may affect their spirituality? Pay particularattention to the issues of:their sense of the church's history toward people with disabilitieswhat Christians (including clergy) said to them that excluded or includedthemhow scripture has been used to blame or heal their woundsexperiences in which others attempted to heal them. Be careful and besensitive to whatever is said.how they see the healing miraclesissues of abuse: physical, sexual, emotional or spiritual. If this comeslisten and try to be present. You do not have to have answers or solvethe issues. Do not leave without acknowledging the privilege of beingpresent with them to hear their stories and affirming the pain of theirexperiences.D Were you able to identify the needs and gifts of the people you met?D What is your reaction to their needs? Can you identify what it means to youpersonally?D How would you, as a pastor, address these needs or areas of concern?> How easy was it for you to identify their gifts? How would you receive them if youwere the pastor?D How did talking with this person(s) change or challenge your assumptions orstereotypes?DDid this encounter raise questions for you that you would like to see addressed inclass? 5. Reflection Groups: We will take some time during the afternoon sessions to reflect togetheron how the readings and your experiences affect your understanding of ministry and theology.What is happening to you as a person and pastor? What have you seen or experienced that haschanged you in some way? What does it mean to you? How will you integrate your learning intoyour own life? Into your ministry? Disability, Spirituality and Healing Theological, Spiritual and Biblical Perspectives for Ministry. 9Dr. Nancy Lane As preparation for your reflections I expect students to take time to carefully evaluatethemselves honestly and clearly. This means being conscious of your feelings, thoughts, andreactions to the various issues of disability. What do issues are raised for you in your encounterswith people with disabilities? Can you identify any fears? Are you afraid of limitation andvulnerability? Do you know why?Not all of your thoughts may be appropriate for group reflection. I expect students to discerncarefully what they feel comfortable discussing in a group. Your journal will be a good place forother thoughts and reflections. You may also make an appointment to speak with me directlyabout issues that are raised for you and which need further attention.6.

The behavior of a healthy community would reflect the following:Negative attitudes disappear as people embrace and practice a liberatory theology wherebyall people are welcomed and included as equals.Stereotyping is non-existent. In listening to the stories of people with disabilities, thecommunity comes to know us as people with real feelings, needs, desires and abilities.Diversity is more desirable than homogeneity.Injustice and oppression come to end as all barriers are removed and non-disabled people areheld accountable for the sins of discrimination, prejudice, exclusion, violence, andmarginalization.Spiritual growth deepens in the community as they learn the significance of recognizinghumanity's interdependence.Attitudes of pity, condescension and charity are replaced with a spirituality of compassion;no one is objectified and there is mutuality in giving and receiving.Inclusion is a reality and not a resolution or mission statement confined to paper androutinely ignored.The spiritual needs of people with disabilities and their families are addressed with concernfor wholeness and healing, rather than blaming and victimization.People with disabilities will live without violence and their abuse will not be tolerated. Theywill be listened to and help provided as appropriate to facilitate justice and healing.The community respects people with disabilitiestheir lives, experiences, and wisdom.The gifts, abilities, and insights of people with disabilities are welcomed and received.The lives of people with disabilities will have value.We will be invited to tell the truth about our lives and our experiences.We will have the power to make decisions about our lives. \u00a9 1998A Healing MinistryThe Rev. Nancy Lane, Ph.D.P.0. Box 274Lansing, N.Y. 14882-0274 We will not experience being silenced, dis-empowered, or otherwise marginalized.We will be allowed to name ourselves and our experiences (self-identified and self-defining)rather than being defined by others.Compassion and respect will accept that we cannot do some things, while celebrating with usthe things we can do.Communities will routinely accommodate our needs.People will stand with us as advocates when necessary.People will welcome our friendship and enter into lasting relationships with us so that we canmove out of exclusion and isolation.' CHARACTERISTICS OF GOD'S COVENANTAL LOVE These are the characteristics which would define a religious community as inclusive.1.God's binds us together as members of a covenantal community. 2.God's love affirms the worth and value of each member without exceptions.3. When God's love is reflected in the life of a community, covenantal love will beextended inclusively. 4.The community will seek to meet the basic needs of every member. 5.They will remember that God's love is steadfast and eternal. 6.They will reflect God's reconciling and forgiving love.2 1The Barb Wire Collective.

Box 274Lansing, N.Y. 14882-0274 52 AESTHETICS OF ASSCESSIBILITY Accessibility into our churches is how we say \"Welcome!\" to persons who happen to live withdisability. But 'the ramp is not enough.' It is imperative that we create an atmosphere of beautyand form that convey a positive message towards accessibility and those who require it.Therefore it is critical that our ramps and entrance ways complement the architecture anddecor of our church grounds and buildings. For instance, materials should complement andnot detract from the original building materials. Care should be given in choosing materialswhich do not require excessive maintenance and which will last. It is of absolute necessity touse the correct scale for ramps so they insure the desired accessibility. When ramps are longor have many turns, the use of landscaping to enhance them is highly desirable. This mayrequire some creative thought and attention to detail. Functional use is only one goal inaccessibility; maintaining or augmenting the beauty and integrity of the church is a primarygoal. This same consideration should be given to your use of accessibility signs. We suggestthat signs be made of lucite and use the required international handicap symbol. This permitsyour signs to be a part of your decor rather than being an unattractive appendage. Signs couldidentify accessible entrances, elevators, and bathrooms. The accessible entrance sign(s)needs to be in plain view of the main entrance and near the sign announcing what church thisis. Remember that your outside sign, and your newspaper ads, cannot say \"TotallyAccessible\" without the following conditions being met: welcoming attitudes of inclusionaccessible entranceaccessible parkingaccessible bathroomlarge bulletinssound system the entire liturgysufficient lighting in the church Accessibility features which are not aesthetically pleasing add to the complaints of those whooppose the presence of persons with disabilities in our churches. Their first complaint isagainst defacing the beauty of their church. We need to be intentional in conveying thataccessibility can be a lovely addition to our churches as well as functional.The beauty and form of our liturgy call us to worship with hearts filled with praise andthanksgiving for the glory of God. May our accessibility endeavors convey more of thatbeauty as we glorify God with our inclusiveness. \u00a91992The Rev. Nancy Lane, Ph.D. 53 COUNSELING PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES OR THEIR FAMILIES I. Learn to understand disability:A. Know something in general about major disabilitiescerebral palsymental retardationmultiple sclerosishead injurymental illnessB. When working with a family or person with a disability, ask them to explain what the disability is, theimplications, and what they understand about it. They are often the real experts of their child or their disability.C. Encourage people with disabilities to learn about their disability and what it means for them if you findthat they are not well informed or are fearful of the disability or disease.D. Assess the needs and strengths of the person.I. They may not know their strengths or their abilities.2. Do not buy into learned helplessness.3. Enable them to be comfortable when help is needed and gracious when not needed. E.Understand the classic grief cycle:1. There is grief over the loss or abilities and perceived images.2. There is anger which must be expressed encourage it and acknowledge it.3. There will be frustration; listen; you do not have to fix it.4. Address their fears.5. Understand something about forgiving .6. Acceptance is not the same as liking a disability; nor is it accomplished once. F.Learn to enter the struggle Be present to the painUnderstand that it is real for themAccept what they feelHelp them to integrate suffering as one dimension of livingMove them toward living with their disability rather than suffering from it. G.Be aware of your own limitationsHow do they enable you to understand and accept the limitations of those whose disability affectsthem in greater areas of their life? \u00a91986The Rev. Nancy Lane, Ph.D.54 II.There are no special skills for working with persons who are disabled or theirfamilies. You already possess skills which can be expanded.A. CRISIS COUNSELING: This skill can be used to work with parents or persons disabled who areunable to accept disability, or let go of their sense of guilt, sin, or grief. Where there is a child with a disabilityinvolved, encourage and enjoy them. Model real acceptance and celebrate both small and big steps in theirgrowth. Look for and encourage the \"rites of passage\" (e.g. baptism, confirmation, etc.) for them and for theirfamily.B. PRESENCE AND SUPPORT: Disability is a long term struggle of coping. Pat, ready made answersfor coping with prejudice and negative attitudes or expectations of others does not provide presence or support.Listening, hearing the pain, entering the struggle, means reaching out even when you do not know what to say.You do not need to have the answers!C. ENABLER: Professionals often overlook the secondary problems of disability, e.g. poverty, agencies,transportation problems, lack of family, emotional and community support, social isolation, sexual issues. There isa need for these persons to know there is someone who understands their needs, can search through the desertof non-existing or inadequate programs, fight the bureaucratic red-tape, or stand with them as they \"fall throughthe cracks\". This may mean finding an able and committed advocate who has the time, energy, and staminanecessary.These are suggested counseling strategies. The essence here is not developing new skills, but rather wideningthe boundaries to include persons previously excluded by therapy.Remember that the questions of any persons in counseling are ultimately spiritual. Counseling must not separatethe questions of living, suffering, or dying from the realm of one's spirituality. To do so would be to fragmentpeople and to deny their search for meaning, which is the penultimate search for God. 5501986The Rev. Nancy Lane, Ph.D. FEARS OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIESTOWARD PEOPLE WITHOUT DISABILITIES 1. FEAR OF INTIMACY:This is the fear of being open and allowing others to get to know you.My insecurity may show and then I will not be accepted.Those who treat me as inferior will dominate me (abuse issues).I often receive pity when I want to be equal.My abilities and gifts are not received; only my disabilities are seen.2. FEAR OF REJECTION:This is the fear of being myself because others won't understand my attitudes,actions or behavior.My integrity is criticized if I am honest about my values and beliefs asone who has experienced a different life/culture.Others have fear of my needs for access, transportation, communicationand understaring.My competence is too often doubted, forcing me to prove myself.3. FEAR OF FAILURE:This is the fear of failing even if I try.Others will only see my loss of control or my struggle, rather than givingme a chance to do things as I can.My worth may be questioned, even though I am giving as well as I can.4. FEAR OF SUCCESS:This is the double-bind fear of succeeding in a society which has few positiveexpectations of persons with disabilities.The extra-effort required to achieve success includes advocacy, struggle,additional energy and resources. This may mean going without a sociallife, so the question becomes \"is it worth the price?\" Also, \"how far can Igo?\"You begin to doubt normality and decide not to pursue your goals.Copyrighted 1989The Rev. Nancy Lane, Ph.D.56 You fail to recognize your own successes and achievements and thinkothers did it for you. You doubt your own abilities.5. FEAR OF CHANGE:This is the fear that things will become worse than they already are.I will be left isolated and unwelcome.Others will make me uncomfortable and will not assist me with realneeds.My independence will be taken away and others will make mydecisions.6. FEAR OF MATURITY:Others will give me too many obligations and responsibilities if I movebeyond self-limiting boundaries of safety.I will be left without choices, only decisions to make without help.There will be no one to walk with me into the unknown.No one will accept the new me if I grow. Copyrighted 1989The Rev. Nancy Lane, Ph.D.57 FINDING ACCEPTANCE OF OURSELVES AND OUR DISABILITIES Know who you are. Accept who you are, without shame, without apology.Integrate your limitations and disabilities into the whole of who you are. When disability is notintegrated as simply one part of a greater whole, it becomes a weapon against ourselves andothers.We are all different, all of us unique. What is good and right for us may be detrimental to another.Some concepts are for you, others are not.Do not blame disability for everything that goes wrong in your life. Everyone struggles with loss,problems, suffering, and eventually death.At the same time, recognize that a struggle for acceptance and value in society is involved. We arenot alone in this struggle but one of many disenfranchised groups in our society and religiouscommunity. We are participating in a universal struggle for acceptance of the diversity which isfound in the image of God.The responsibility for yourself, your life, and your growth is yours alone, and no one else's. The\"blaming game\" is a dead end, vicious circle that leads no where except to more of the same. Oneof the more radical approaches to personality transformation allows for no reasons, nojustifications, and no excuses. This is the point at which we cry, \"Okay, it's you and me, God!!\"Acceptance comes as we do the hard work of healing the deep wounds which may have beencaused by abuse, rejection, loss, betrayal, injury, and so forth. We heal the wounds as we nameand acknowledge their affect on our lives; forgive ourselves, others and God as necessary; and letgo of the pain.Allow yourself to enter into the moments of anguish, depression, failure, and grief. We doexperience loss; we do grieve for real or perceived images of who we were or might have been. Thegrief cycle will recur throughout your life time. You cannot conclude it once and for all. Recognizeit when it comes and know it will pass. You will not be shattered by it but you will be expanded bythe presence of God in the midst of the journey through it.One of the most debilitating neuroses of our time has been defined as being the desire to be perfect.This is the trap of the \"tyranny of the should's,\" which says:We should be honest, courageous, brave, unselfish. We should be perfect. Weshould be able to endure everything, be like everybody, love everyone; nothingshould matter; we should never feel hurt, or feel sorry for oneself; we should begrateful to be alive at all times; we should be in control of all emotionsnaieelings;we should not wish for things to be different; we should be able to overcome everydifficulty. A HEALING MINISTRYThe Rev. Nancy Lane, Ph.D.P. 0. Box 274Lansing, N.Y. 14882-0274 The \"should's\" are a pressure against us determined by a world alien to who we are. As long as we\"should,\" we are serving the gods of others and not trusting our inner responsibility to being whowe are, as we are. Authentic acceptance is claiming our own experience, authority, and thoughts,while also being honest about our limitations and circumstances.Acceptance is found only be letting go of our \"idealized self-image\" which denies our limitationsand problems. As we face our disabilities with honesty, we will struggle with the suffering andpain we feel. However, entering into this suffering actually liberates us from the suffering ofinjured vanity and excessive sensitivity to the world.Acceptance means who do not have to apologize for being disabled or needing assistance. It isletting go of all guilt and shame. People who abuse, discriminate, and are otherwise insensitive,unaware, or inaccessible do not apologize for their behavior. You do not need to be \"sorry\" forbeing who you are, or for needing more time, assistance, and for using assistive devices. When wedo not apologize for little accidents, we avoid passing guilt around, and we allow grace to work inand through our disabilities. We become witnesses of God at work in and through our lives as weare.Acceptance is not \"out there\" somewhere: it is to be found deep within ourselves.. If we cannot acceptwho we are, we cannot expect others to do so. Focus on the abilities you have been given, and noton what you have lost or never had.Acceptance is the result of integrating disability and all the feelings and emotions associated withthat experience. Acceptance is being healed of bitterness and resentment through forgivingourselves, others and GOD. Acceptance is about being whole in body, mind and spirit. It is notabout having disability removed from your life. It is about living with disability in creative andmeaningful ways which celebrate the goodness of who we are.Acceptance is knowing fully who you are, and then claiming the freedom to Be and Become Allthat God has created you to be in the world. Acceptance is discerning and claiming your gifts andabilities and then using them creatively to make a difference in the world around you.YOU ARE ACCEPTEDIt is that mixture of selfishness and self-hate that permanently pursues us, that prevents us fromloving others, and that prohibits us from losing ourselves in the love with which we are loved eternally. Hewho is able to love himself is able to love others also; she who has learned to overcome self-contempt hasovercome contempt for others. We cannot transform our lives, unless we allow them to be transformed by thestroke of {God's} grace.Grace strikes us when we are in great pain and restlessness. [Grace] strikes us when we walkthrough the dark valley of a meaningless and empty life. [Grace] strikes us when we feel that our separation A HEALING MINISTRYThe Rev. Nancy Lane, Ph.D.P. 0. Box 274Lansing, N.Y. 14882-0274 259 is deeper than usual, because we have violated another life, a life which we loved, or from which we wereestranged. [Grace] strikes us when our disgust for our own being, our indifference, our weakness, ourhostility, and our lack of direction and composure have become intolerable for us. [Grace] strikes us when,year after year, the longed-for perfection of life does not appear, when the old compulsions reign within us asthey have for decades, when despair destroys all joy and courage. You are accepted. You are accepted,accepted by that which is greater than you. Simply accept the fact that you are accepted.' 1 Paul Tillich. \"You Are Accepted,\" in The Shaking of the Foundations. New York: Charles Scribers, 1948, 161. A HEALING MINISTRYThe Rev. Nancy Lane, Ph.D.P. O. Box 274Lansing, N.Y. 14882-0274 60 IMPLICATIONS OF DISABILITY ON FAMILY LIFEDisability is almost always understood as catastrophic. It may be seen as punishment, andit usually is seen as being destructive to one's hopes, dreams, and plans for life. How oneunderstands disability in oneself or in a family member is predicated upon the following:The developed capacity to understand what happened, e.g. the cause.The strength of family relationships, e.g. accepting, supportive.One's environment, e.g. freedom in accessibility or isolation.The spiritual and religious beliefs one has, or the lack thereof.The degree of pain and symptom relief, e.g. pain management and control ofsymptoms.Note: Pain cannot be understood within the strict confines of physicalsymptoms. Pain is a symptom of the whole person: physical, psychological& spiritual. Thus, the level of pain and suffering one is experiencing cannotbe determined quickly or easily. It requires an extensive and comprehensiveevaluation of the person's physical, psycho-social, and spiritual condition,including levels of access, isolation, finances, ability to make appropriatechoices, and ability to maintain a measure of autonomy.These considerations are essential in understanding the ethicalimplications of the \"right to die\" movement. The disability rightsmovement recognizes these implications and the failure of non-disabledpeople to insure that a quality of life is accessible to people withdisabilities. Their impatience and social constructs of disability as \"toopainful\" or \"life not worth living\" has allowed our nation to consider\"legalized medical killing\" which is what is left when the euphemism'sare taken away. (See C. Newell and others.)People in or near a family respond to the developing characteristics of disabilityaccording to the age of the one who is or who becomes disabled. Those reactions influencehow (or if) they will chose to help. The following sections list the reactions of peopleaccording to the age of the child at the onset of disability:AGE 1-3:- Ourfeelings are influenced by behavior of child.- Theirdependency is source of our anxiety.- We mayfeel anger at the parents for their failure to protect the child...evenbefore birth. (This may allow people to \"blame the victim\".)- Parents mayfeel responsible, resulting in anger, guilt, grief.410\u00a91989 1The Rev. Nancy Lane, Ph.D.61 While family togetherness is crucial, some families split apart and do notsupport each other.AGE 3-5:- Disabilityhappens to \"others\", not to a child, especially one of \"ours\".- Disability isassociated with coldness and disfigurement.- Disability isn't permanent, e.g. the reality doesn't sink in.- Illness isperceived as a just punishment (usually from God).- The child cantolerate separation, so s/he can be institutionalized, e.g. out ofsight:a) placement equals rejection; b) society says we can \"kick\" a child out ofthe family because we have \"kicked\" them out of society.AGE 6-11:- Disabilityhas a meaning all of its own: a) it's permanent or b) reserved forold age. Therefore, childhood disability is unnatural; is not fair; can beattributed to external factors.- Our ownfear of injury/mutilation becomes more pronounced.- The child orfamily is blamed (blaming the victim).- The child is not tobe told anything beyond bare minimum, as the hopes/he will be \"normal\" is sustained regardless of the cost.AGE 12-18:- They arebudding roses, full of vitality, so there is less acceptance of theirbeing disabled.- Physical ravages areleast endurable.- Theirdependency and/or physical deterioration creates feelings in othersof shame, disgust, and disgrace. Families always have certain expectations. Those expectations change where there is achild with a disability, creating additional stresses on family life:Stress is related to the relative expectations of the parents for themselves.Middle class families usually have control over their lives, make goals and haveplans which usually happen. A child with a disability (especiallydevelopmental) challenges all of that, bringing a sense of powerlessness. Thefamily then looks for a quick fix, which can come in the form of denial. \u00a91989 262 The Rev. Nancy Lane, Ph.D. CLINICAL STRESSES FOR PARENTS:They have lost the fantasized child (who is never disabled).Parents grieve as if child had died; grief cycle lasts lifetime.They worry what to do with the child who IS here.- They need correctand adequate information about the disability andresources.- There is a needfor responsive interaction with child: bonding is moredifficult if the child is blind.The burden of care takes a huge toll on a family.The stigma on families is draining as it is continuous.These stresses emerge in waves over life-span, so appears as periodic crisis.Families are more socially isolated; they get away less, need for respite care isproblem.Caretaker (usually mother) is most stressed, affects other children and father.Stress in mothers equals response of the child with a disability to her.Studies indicate problems between mother and child when first-born isdisabled. - Similar problems between disabled mother/eldest daughter,disabled father/eldest son.Divorced mothers of children with developmental disabilities turn to clergymost often because they are even more socially isolated.Interaction of mother with her non-disabled child is very different:- She is overprotectiveof child w/ disability; the child is never the leader,mother knows best--always doing TO the child; does not enhance the child'ssense of self.- Adolescentnon-disabled child gets to babysit too much so is isolated frompeers; cannot say no to mother; developmental needs are affected. COUNSELING PARENTS ABOUT NON-DISABLED SIBLINGS:> Do not expect them to hide their tears; they too feel loss.Include them in plans for the child w/disability which affect family life.They have fears that disability is contagious, runs in the families and otherfantasies.Let them bring the gift of who they are to the situation/family.> Do not say \"God willed this.\" Offer a model of God that is loving andcompassionate, rather than capricious.> They may go play as a way of reducing their anxiety.> Siblings have more difficulty if the one with a disability is of same sex.The child who is normal is overloaded with responsibility. \u00a91989 3The Rev. Nancy Lane, Ph.D.63 IMPORTANT FAMILY HELPS FOR ALLEVIATING STRESS:> Positive family perceptions of who they are together.> The strength of the marriage.> The support of extended family.> Emotional support from within and without family.> Having a network of friends, one of which is intimate.> Reciprocity: being able to give back in order to keep your support systemgoing.- Support networks of families with disabled children usually contain morefamily than friends. Family members burn out and do not wait for thereciprocity.Mothers seldom have the energy to remember and do theniceties.> Being involved with the community, e.g. neighbors, church, professionals.Availability of financial resources: determines quality and quantity of neededservices, household help, and equipment.Play time for family members.Respite care for families improves their perception of their child w/ disability.Reduces over-protectiveness. Social isolation leads to enmeshment. \u00a9 1989The Rev. Nancy Lane, Ph.D. Ways the Church Can Provide Help for Families of Persons with Disabilities The birth of a child with a disability contributes to the divorce rate and to women being single parent, head ofhousehold. Even where there is no divorce, it seems to contribute to the growing incidence of spouse and childabuse. It also affects family incomeusually leaving one income instead of two, and creating greater demand onavailable financial resources.I. When you know there is a child with a disability: early intervention can provide for better information and options for the familyconnect family with someone who knows where programs/services are and who knows how toaccess themarrange for respite care through volunteers Although there are many programs for families, there are few which speak to the needs of families of persons withdisabilities. II.Families need on-going spiritual growth. They need access to the church through accessible architecture, appropriate communications, andwelcoming and inclusive attitudes.We need to recognize that there are differences in needs for these families; there are also differencesin how each church can carry out their ministry with persons with disabilities.There is a real ministry in expecting \"appropriate\" behavior from persons with disabilities. Allowinginappropriate behavior is destructive to the persons and to the community.Provide aid in Christian education classes and in worship services. Allow persons with developmentaldisabilities or mental retardation to be full participants in the mainstream and not in \"special\" classesor separate services.Be aware that the staff of group homes often interfere with church participation. Their approach isthat \"we\" know what \"they\" need (This is also dismissive of parents who may be the real authoritieson their child). III.What can Church do uniquely that no one in community can do: Provide faith commitmentProvide a presenceBe a community of prayerBe a source of spiritual growth for the familyIV. What must the Church do: AcceptHopeCelebrateEducateMinister Copyrighted 1985The Rev. Nancy Lane, Ph.D. 65 V. What might the Church do: Serve as a model of total accessibility and acceptanceVI. What the Church should not do:inflict guiltbe blind to need, e.g. \" we have no one with a disability here\"be ignorant of either the needs or the abilities of someone with a disabilityVII. What Churches can do to undo the damage:REMEMBER: the church can be a lonely place for the family of a person with a disability.People with disabilities do not want to be \"special\" but want to be part of the community.People with disabilities want to be touched - but always ask first.Help the parish to know that mental retardation can happen in any family.The challenge to the church is whether they can and will accept any and everyoneKnow how to respond to the birth of a child with a disability rather than reacting to it.Learn how to respond to all persons with disabilities.If there are no persons with developmental disabilities in your church, ask WHY: what are you doingabout it?If there are persons with D.D., are you doing \"with\" them, rather than \"to\" or \"for\" them?Are there people who will sit with a child who is disabled during church so that parents canparticipate in worship?Are young persons w/ disabilities active in Youth Group, or camping?The Church can address the alienation of persons with disabilities by caring, which leads to healing.Do not be afraid to speak to the sexuality of persons with disabilities.The Church can serve as an advocate for people with disabilities, especially in employment:does their employer value the person for his or her work?remember that their rate of pay = valueAre we ministering to the staff and volunteers of persons with disabilities, who are often wounded people? Copyrighted 1985The Rev. Nancy Lane, Ph.D. 66 THE GRIEF CYCLE Emotional Stages for People with DisabilitiesGrief gains momentum anytime the reality of disability affects one's life, rather it is having accessto people, places and events, or the ability to make choices. Each disappointment and loss triggersthe feelings associated with earlier losses and disappointments. Each instance may revive thesadness, frustration, helplessness, and anger associated with being disabled. 1. SHOCK AND DESPAIR:> The onset of a disability may cause shock as it changes the dreams, goals andexpectations that had been taken for granted.> Despair is usually about the losses related to our person--the Self. It is about what weare without, e.g. a particular ability or image (Kierkeggard).> There can be despair over external realities related to barriers of access anddiscrimination in seeking employment, medical care, or social inclusion. 2. ANGER:Sources of anger in the grief cycle, These are normal and must be expressed in order to move through them.These are not to be confused with the issues of anger related to empowerment, equality and justice.> Anger at the disability .> Anger at ourselves (did we cause it? do we deserve it? The \"why\" questions).> Anger at doctors, nurses, spouse, parents, children (they may deny our limitationsor pain).> We may see our anger as being unforgivable (further lowering our self esteem).> We may feel overwhelmed by helplessness.> The gaps between our idealized self-image and our actual selves are exposed,shattering illusions. \u00a9 1987A HEALING MINISTRYThe 6i \"Self-esteem reflects the congruity or the incongruity...between the ideal self we aspire to beand the actual self we experience in reality. When we have come to accept our limitationsand our capabilities, when our ideal selves are in reasonable harmony, our self-regard islikely to be secure and resilient. It can absorb some of the bruises\"1> We feel inadequate, to blame, guilty, and hostile.It is important to help people express their anger with God and eventually to forgive God. This enablespeople to develop a stronger relationship with God and to live out of a deep faith which provides strength toface what is so painful now.3. BARGAINING:> Bargaining is an attempt to return to \"normal\". This is part of a stage of denial. Peoplecannot move through this until they have enough ego strength to face into their innerpain.4. DEPRESSION:Depression is a normal response to any situation of loss and grieving. Some depressions require more medicalintervention than others. All depression is related to our spiritual life and our search for meaning andpurpose. We need to ask what God is saying to us in depression. It is helpful to work with a spiritual directorand to read about the \"dark night of the soul.\" The spiritual journey into darkness is a familiar theme inclassical spirituality: Jolm of the Cross, Teresa of Avila, Dante' and others.Depression related to disability is a reaction to:> Loss of perceived images and abilities of self.> Loss of image of what it means to be an upwardly mobile family.> Loss of expected or hoped for dreams.> Loss of abilities once had or wished for.> Loss of or impaired health.> Pain that is not controlled.> Inability to fix or change the disability.> Guilt: feeling to blame for the disability. McCollum, Audrey T., \"Grieving Over the Lost Dream,\" in The Exceptional Parent, pp. 9-12, February 1984. \u00a91987A HEALING MINISTRYThe Rev. Nancy Lane, Ph.D.P.0. Box 274Lansing, N.Y. 14882-02742 Depression is an expected response to significant disappointment and loss, even the loss of dreams.Depression is marked by helplessness and a loss of self-esteem, outward signs of the inner fear or realihy of thedisabilihj. Depression usually enfolds a faltering self-image. 5. ACCEPTANCE:> This does not mean \"liking\" one's disability, but rather it means learning to live withit rather than suffering from it.Letting go of the false ideals of power and perfection.> No longer turning critical judgments from others into harsh self-judgments (lettinggo of the tyranny of the \"should's\".> Recognizing anger and finding appropriate expressions of it in safe places. Learninghow anger can be creative and putting it to work for us, rather than against us.> Seeking self-forgiveness; forgiving God and others, so that we eliminate guilt anddisappointment.> Letting go of lost or shattered dreams, reconciling oneself to the reality of disability.Accepting that which cannot be changed, while looking for modifications for thosethings which can be changed, e.g. problem-solving can change many things so thatwe are not left helpless. Remember that people with disabilities, parents, other family members, and care givers, are eachin a different stage of the grief cycle and may not be able to communicate where they are. Theymay not even know where they are, much less why.Being courageous in the face of adversity does not serve anyone well. When we postpone grief itwill erupt in other ways, perhaps as a global anger and bitterness. It will affect our mind, thuscausing biological changes in our bodies until we are physically ill. If we avoid dealing with grief,we succeed only in drawing our emotional energy away from our family and friends. We becomedistant and detached, further isolating ourselves, thus further contributing to grief and anger.The grief cycle is part of our growth. It is part of the journey to God. It is not to be avoided, nor is itto merely be endured. It is to be entered into; we have to walk through it in order to move beyondit. \u00a9 1987A HEALING MINISTRYThe Rev. Nancy Lane, Ph.D.P.0.

Use your nicest dishes, light acandle, put on nice music.Make meal time special - a time to appreciate the goodness of yourself andyour home.Be careful about junk foods, high sugar content, and empty calories. Sugarcauses severe insulin drops which affect depression and mood swings. We donot have to do this to our bodies. Read labels; there is sugar where you leastexpect it. Be careful also of processed foods which are non-nutritional.Food can be an addiction when \"we are starved for love.\" You will need to fillyour emptiness with good things, and we begin by choosing good food to eat.If alcohol and drug addiction are a problem, begin a routine of eating hotoatmeal every morning. Meditate for a time afterwards. 0Find a support group and a community where there is prayer andworship.0Join a Recovery Group.0See a psychotherapist and work on your issues of inner pain.0Find a trained Spiritual Director to help you sort out your relationship toGod and Self.Make sure that you have adequate vitamins to account for any additional stress onyour body due to illness, disease, etc.Depression can be something calling us to sleep and rest while our wounds heal. Restaccording to your physical needs. Do not keep going when you need a break. Youare not weak, or failing; you are limited. Loving oneself includes allowing the body theattention it needs to not be exhausted.Rest can also include hot baths, with sweet smells and soft music.

Dreams are keys to your healing.Reduce all chaos inyour life by creating a space of beauty and around you. Make it aslight and orderly as possible. You will feel much more rested and less chaotic inside.Find a way of exercising: swimming at the Y or a high school. Movement to music canbe helpful; walking, deep breathing; find a way to get fresh air everyday.Meditation and prayer for spiritual and psychological health are essential. Taking 20minutes once or twice a day to quiet your thoughts, empty your mind' and be still. It isa way of reducing chaos in your life.Make a special place to meditate even if it is a corner.Have a candle, some incense, a picture or icon, a cross, or a rosary, or all ofthem.There are lovely meditation tapes to use; if money is a problem use the library,beg copies from friends. 1I am not here speaking of emptying the mind as in TM or New Age. That emptying can lead toa false self feeling in control and to negative energy leading one on the wrong path.

Box 274, Lansing, NY 14882-027471 IDENTIFYING SPIRITUAL NEEDS Illness, disease, addiction, depression, emotional disorders and other imbalances inour lives are directly related to unmet spiritual needs. We are most aware of spiritualneeds whenever we question the meaning of our life. Spiritual needs are those needs forour life to have meaning and purpose:ForgivenessReassuranceAcceptanceHopePeaceGiving thanks for the goodness of our lifeThese are universal needs whether or not one is \"religious.\" These needs are presentthroughout one's life, in good times and in bad times. Some of these needs may be met byfriends, family or others. This is not enough for most people, especially in times of crisis.This is because of the deep, inner longing that cannot be met by another human being.This longing is always for God, who alone can satisfy our deepest hunger and thirst. Thedepth of this thirst and hunger is known by acknowledging how much it takes to satisfythe demands of your addiction (e.g. how much and how long did you drink, drug,gamble, smoke, shop, etc.?)On a clean sheet(s) of paper, list your spiritual needs.

Box 274, Lansing, NY 14882-027472 FORGIVENESS Forgiveness is about letting go of pain so that we can move on.When we forgive someone who has hurt us, we let go of the pain their hurt caused us.When we accept forgiveness from God, we let go of guilt, shame and feelings ofworthlessness.When we accept forgiveness from others, we let go false pride, guilt, and shame.When we forgive ourselves, we let go of our mistakes, poor choices, and our need tobe the suffering martyr.When we let go, we heal. Forgiving enables us to heal the psychological wounds sothat we are free to move on.Forgiveness helps us to make positive changes in our lives and improve of sense ofself-worth.1 When we do not forgive, we hang on to the grudges, resentments, andself-defeating behaviors that are a barrier to a healthy and productive life.2Forgiveness helps to \"re-create your life, rebuild your self-esteem, and find the innerpeace\" which you seek. Working your way through forgiveness will help you to:> acknowledge your hurt and understand the things you have done because yourwere hurt;> get rid of guilt and shame and stop taking the blame for all that has happenedto you;> stop sabotaging behaviors and break old patterns of relating to life;> unload your anger; \u00a9 1994A Healing MinistryThe Rev.

It lightens our burden as we no longer have toexpend our energy carrying pain, anger and resentments. We need God's love flowingthrough our lives and our being--loving, healing, illuminating and reconciling all that isbroken, lost, or in pain.To forgive is to confess to God the things we have done and the things we havefailed to do. Having another person hear you is an important part of the journey and wewill talk about that shortly. Confessing may take the form of writing out the things thatyou need to let go of. Your confessor may suggest burning this as a concrete, visible wayof letting it go. Confessing requires humility--simply meaning that we come to realize thatwe are dependent on God, rather than on angry self-determination.Forgiveness is a process, and not accomplished simply or easily. It takes time. Weforgive only as much as we can at any given time - -and never more than we are ready toforgive. Forgiveness is not about forgetting what has been done to us; it is aboutremembering it in ways which deepen our wisdom and maturity--rather than feeding ouranger and resentment.Remember this is a process and one that cannot be hurried. We cannot forgiveanyone until we are ready. Do not try to rush it. Be patient with the process and withyourself.We begin with ourselves: asking God to forgive us those things which havebeen destructive to ourselves, to others and to God.We forgive ourselves for those things God has already forgiven us for--ourmistakes, our selfishness and willfulness. Then we must accept God'sforgiveness.We forgive those who have wronged or injured us.We live as people who are forgiven. Copyrighted 1996A Healing MinistryThe Rev. Nancy Lane, Ph.D.P. 0. Box 274, Lansing, NY 14882-02747 5 If we believe we are forgiven then we will act that way: our self-image willimprove; we will be more positive about life, our potential and our future; we willbe reconciled to others and will behave in a more loving manner.God is more ready to speak than we are to listen. The art of listening to thevoice of God in our midst probably develops out of our sense of despair,failure and pain, as it did [for] Elijah. ...What we hear the voice of Godsaying is more like the whisper of silence; more like the roaring of awaterfall; more like the secure movement of a held and sleeping infant.What we hear is the Voice beyond all voices: affirming and calling us to ahumble, forgiving, trusting and compassionate walk, not through a gardenof un-imagined splendor, but through the grubby reality of the everyday(Incarnate Hearing, Jeff Hamilton). Copyrighted 1996A Healing MinistryThe Rev. Nancy Lane, Ph.D.P. 0. Box 274, Lansing, NY 14882-027476 FORGIVING GOD Forgive God for the pain and suffering which you feel is unfair and deep. We are not suggesting thatyou forgive God for not getting your own way in life. No one does. Nor should we forgive God forwhat we bring upon ourselves ... addictions, bad habits, irresponsible living.Hating God is much healthier then turning hatred in upon ourselves. It takes courage and aknowledge of God. Hating yourself is simply hating God in disguise because you lack courage to dootherwise. Expressing this strong feeling puts the venom \"out there\" rather than allowing it to destroythe God-given potential with us. It allows us to be honest and break down the barriers between usand God so that eventually we can receive forgiveness and heal.Stop defending God or trying to explain away the darkness of God. To seek a God of love is toencounter a living presence in whom there is both dark and light, good and evil, love and anger, lightand fire. When we are defending God, we are not attending to the inner struggle which calls us fromsomething to something better. Denying the darkness will not help us to see the Light any better,Light has shadows. The cross casts the deepest shadow.Life is not perfect; it comes with pain and suffering. It also comes with things which give us happinessand meaning.Evil and darkness are realities and are necessary if there we are also to have good and light.God suffers with us. We are not abandoned.God forgives those who have brought pain and destruction into our lives.God forgives us for the pain and destruction we cause others or ourselves. ANGER AS A CREATIVE POWER We may combine our anger with intelligence and reasoning so that we develop a sharp mind.Anger may motivate our ambition and we will achieve our goals.Anger stir us to work for justice where there is injustice.Anger may drive us to work tirelessly on behalf of others who suffer.We can turn anger into compassion by being present to the suffering of others (e.g. listening, praying,visiting, support groups, volunteer work). \u00a9 1995A Healing MinistryThe Rev.

It is no different in caring for someone who lives with disability. 1.See the presence of the Incarnate God in the person. Respond to the disabilitysecondly. Then you can see and hear what is offered or needed. 2.It is rarely inappropriate to ask the person what their disability is or to ask how youcan be helpful. Asking is caring enough to know the person. 3.Disability is not usually an illness. It is rarely contagious. 4.Listen: you may not be asked to do anything but asked to receive something theyhave to offer. 5.Listen: you do not need to have the answers and may not be called upon to provideany. 6.Listen: simply be present to the pain or the joy. Caring is part of your job already. 111117.Listen: the person with a disability can tell you best what they need, how you canprovide it, and why it is important. 8.Learn: You do not have to be an expert in anything. People with disabilities are theexperts in their disability and usually know what they need for acceptance andinclusion. 9.Learn from their ability to embrace vulnerability and their ability to ask the toughquestions of life and faith. Do not be afraid of your own vulnerability.10. Learn that some people with disabilities are angry, stuck, hurting or without neededcare, support, etc. These are universal experiences which are often heaped onto theperson who has been ignored, forgotten, or unwelcome. Their ability (and inability) tosort it all out can teach you about prejudice, compassion, discrimination, courage andsuffering.11. Accept the person as you would any other. You don't have to understand everythingor like everything about them. CLERGY TRAINING/STAFF DEVELOPMENTThe Rev. Nancy Lane, Ph.D.\u00a91994781 12. Be prepared to make referrals just as you would for anyone needing counseling,respite care, employment, etc. (Most clergy are not good at referral for anything andneed to develop this skill.)13. Recognize your own fears (and/or) projections about limitation, powerlessness,illness, and death. Fear of their need for assistance or help is probably denial and fearof your own in ability to be inter-dependent.14. Don't be afraid to ask someone to repeat something if you did not understand. It isinsulting and patronizing to pretend you understood when it is crystal clear by yourlook or response that you did not--and did not care enough to be sure you did.15. People with disabilities have the same emotions, desires, and needs as people withoutdisabilities. They may have tough questions of faith and prayer but they are notdifferent from others; we are forced by circumstance to wrestle with God-issues moreopenly and honestly because we usually cannot hide or deny our limitations.Ministering with people with disabilities is not something added on to your pastoralresponsibilities. It is an integral part of what you already do and is something which cannurture your spiritual life if you allow it to do so.Clergy get caught up in wondering how to answer or address the issues posed by thesimple presence of a person with disability. The more important questions are ignored:What is God asking of you by the presence of this person in your life?What can you learn from or because of this person(s)?What issues and questions of your life are confronted by the needs or issues of theperson(s) with a disability in your congregation?Does your church reflect diversity and receive the gifts of all people or does thechurch work to avoid and exclude any who remind them of the limitations, imperfectionsand injustices of God's created order?How does your church's response reflect their ability (or lack thereof) to be awelcoming and healing community?What is God doing in the life of your church under your leadership because of theperson(s) with disabilities and/or their families? CLERGY TRAINING/STAFF DEVELOPMENTThe Rev. Nancy Lane, Ph.D.\u00a91994792 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF DISABILITYFaculty and Staff Training and DevelopmentAs a general rule, special skills are not necessary for working with people with disabilities. Understanding the issues of people living with disability allowsone to use one's skills for effective listening, care, and/or referral.Understand that low self-esteem and chronic depression are major issues related to the psycho-social and economic problems that are prevalent when living with disability.Understand that learned helplessness people with disability needs to de dealt with directly, rather than feeding it.Recognize projected anger and deflect it wisely (e.g. not blaming or isolating the person in punishment).Learn to hear frustration and anger in constructive ways.Remember that anger may be the only appropriate response of the person to discrimination, isolation, abuse, etc. Help the person to use the anger to work for change if possible.Redefine negative expectations - yours and theirs.Recognize your own fear of limitation and disability.There may be a \"fear-of-success\" in people with disabilities because of the negative attitudes of society and the need of many people without disabilities to take care of people with disabilities.Encourage and enable people with disabilities to discover and use their potentiality and abilities.Accept the reality of limitations where necessary while also challenging them where possible.Remember the politics of language: it can empower or dis-empower people with disabilities. Avoid medical language as it defines people in the limited terms of a sickness model.Use creative approaches to encourage people with disabilities to learn their own stories for personal growth.Encourage people with disabilities to integrate their disability into the totality of their life experience rather than as something dragged along behind them. \u00a91990 1 The Rev. Nancy Lane, Ph.D.so SOME WORKING DEFINITIONS OF SPIRITUALITY Spirituality is about knowing God in a very intimate relationship, as opposed tohaving \"Knowledge of or \"information concerning\" God. Spirituality is rooted in one'sexperience of God in life. Spirituality bears witness to the revelation of God on thepilgrimage; it speaks about God's holiness and God's justice, in personal and in social life.Spirituality bears witness to the mystery of God, and to the mystery at the heart of thehuman encounter with God. It leads people away from easy answers into the dark night offaith. Spirituality knows God as the ground of all reality and of our own beings. It seeks todeepen one's inner life and holds together the mystical and political dimensions of the lifeof faith. Spirituality takes seriously the experiences of God in all people and learns tolisten to those who critique Christian tradition because of marginality (See Leech,Experiencing God).Spirituality is defined as the life principle that pervades a person's entire being,including volitional, emotional, moral-ethical, intellectual, and physical dimensions, andgenerates a capacity for transcendent values. Spirituality integrates and transcends thebiological and psychological dimensions. Spirituality is about the deep search to findpersonal meaning in life. When one develops a spirituality, it becomes possible to relateto reality with hope, even in the presence of suffering.Three things are necessary for one to resolve a spiritual crisis (such as addiction,dis-ease, depression, etc.) and transcend suffering with integrity instead of despair:A desire to find and give personal meaning to one's experience/suffering.A deep desire for relatedness to God.An awareness of your true Self SPIRITUALITY: GOD/SELF AND WHOLENESS The Self refers to the whole of one's personality-- ego, consciousness, personaland collective unconsciousness. \"Self\" with a capital \"S\" is different from \"self', with asmall \"s\", which refers to the ego alone. At the root of finding Self is the key word\u00a9 1995The Rev. Nancy Lane, Ph.D.P. 0. Box 274, Lansing, NY 1488281 \"acceptance.\" \"The Self as the center and totality of the psyche which is able to reconcileall opposites can be considered as the organ of acceptance par excellence.\"When we seek after self-knowledge, we want to know who we truly are, asopposed to \"being yourself.\" Self-knowledge requires becoming more conscious thanone has been.Jung described the search for the Self as when people come to know themselvesand accept who they are, being reconciled within, and to the adversity in their lives. Hesaw it as making peace with God, but giving over self-will for God's will (cf. Jung,Collected Works).The Self is a symbol signifying a union between the opposites within the psycheand \"is a God-image, or at least cannot be distinguished from one\" (Jung, CollectedWorks). The Self is not God but there is a psychological relationship between the Self andGod. The Self is God within as God cannot be \"wholly other.\"The Self is the wholeness of the personality,\" which if all goes well is harmonious,but which cannot tolerate self deceptions\" (Jung, Memories, Dreams & Reflections).Finding the Self is the goal of psychic development. The Self emerges as the result of theindividuation process, which is a long process of integrating all the fragments of ourunconsciousness into a whole which is conscious of itself (Singer, Boundaries of theSoul).Through the individuation process, one begins to realize and integrate the abilitiesand potentialities which have always been within one. The search for Self enables one tothrow off the projections and conventions of the world in order to be more fully who one is.It is finding one's own direction, purpose and value.\"To those who [feel] rejected and [unloved], this process offers thepotentiality of restoring faith in themselves. It may give them back theirhuman dignity and assure them of their place in the world\" (Singer,Boundaries of the Soul). \u00a9 1995The Rev. Nancy Lane, Ph.D.P. 0. Box 274, Lansing, NY 1488282 SPIRITUAL ABUSE AND THE CHURCHAll discrimination perpetuates marginalization, spiritual abuse, oppression, and injustice. The Church must take the appropriate steps to embrace and practice the principles of inclusion and equality set forth in the Americans with Disabilities Act (1990). In doing so they will also promote justice bypracticing the \"law of love\" set forth in the teachings of scripture. The following excerpts have been selected to illustrate these points:Whenever people with disabilities fail to ask for access and inclusion in theChurch they contribute to their own oppression. To be silent about exclusion is to\"internalize ableism\" and perpetuates the spiritual abuse of the Church towardus. \"Spiritual Abuse is the act of denying people considered disabled their fullhumanity. It is to treat and care for them as if they were less than human.\"'\"Problems associated with having a disability go beyond the physical limitationsimposed by the disability itself. The sense of exclusion we are likely toexperience produces spiritual wounds: anger, low self-esteem, a sense ofinferiority, a sense of meaninglessness, despair, even loss of faith.\"\"People with disabilities, who are clearly loved by God, have often not been ableto hear God's word, to see God's glory or to feel the healing warmth andaffirmation of God's community of faith. This exclusion...has caused people withdisabilities to feel marginalized in the very places where love and justice arepreached and practiced.\"'\"Having a disability can lead to the destruction of one's sense of life's meaning,not because the disability in itself in any way diminishes the intrinsic value ofone's life, but because the social consequences can be so profound. People withdisabilities are often see by mainstream society as other, in some marginalcategory, not whole, not fully human. Having a disability can render onedependent on others, threatening one's sense of self-esteem. It can limit one'sproductivity, leading others to underestimate the productive capacities one mayactually still have. Having a disability can thus be socially isolating, creating asense of rejection and fears of abandonment, even abandonment by God. Thusthe social consequences of physical disability can leave one with a sense that one's life has lost its meaning.'\"\"To be prevented, because of disability, from entering or serving in God'ssanctuary should be unthinkable. To give up, because of disability, the goal ofbecoming a priest or minister, should be unthinkable. To be denied, because ofdisability, the healing, cooling, uplifting waters of faithfulness, should be equallyunthinkable. To speak directly, who among us has the right to tell anotherperson, by action, word or unwelcoming attitude, that they are not worthy enough The Rev. Nancy Lane, Ph.D. 83 to worship and serve God? No person, no group of people, has the right toexclude another from worship.\"The attitudinal barriers erected by the church puts disability in asociopolitical category. These barriers are often more handicapping than isan individuals disability:Barriers lead to positions of subordination and social disadvantagelack of access to employment and health care, discrimination, poverty,and isolation.These barriers make disability an issue of justice.People with disabilities become an oppressed group because ofattitudes and behaviors, ...avoidance and assumptions [by otherpeople].Personal boundaries are repeatedly violated because people withdisabilities are not seen as real people.People with disabilities are either made invisible or given specialattention that is embarrassing or demeaning.Negative stereotypes portray people with disabilities as passive,dependent, childlike. The person is perceived as an object. One'shumanity is lost when they are objectified.When people with disabilities are excluded from the Church, theirstrengths go unacknowledged or underdeveloped, and the Church iscut off from what these people have to offerwhich is valuable. 1\"People with disabilities have valuable perspectives based on theirexperiences with their bodies and with the oppression theyexperience... We lose the insight that comes from their pain andloss, from struggle and suffering and overcoming the barriers toliving. ...When we create barriers..., we lost the additional insightthat comes from experiences of achievement and fulfillment, ofsolidarity and community. \"v\"\"The ADA (July 1990) prohibits discrimination against and provides equal accessfor people with disabilities to employment... ...the ADA challenges thestereotype of viewing people with disabilities as ...needing treatment orsupervision... The intention of the ADA is to ensure that all Americans...receiveequal opportunity to participate freely and fully in society, a goal fully consistentwith a Christian ethic of love and justice. ...churches and other religiousorganizations... are required to comply only with the employment and promotion The Rev. Nancy Lane, Ph.D. 84 2 provisions of the law, as stated in Title One [of the ADA]. These provisions prohibit discrimination against persons with disabilities in any aspect of theemployment processhiring and promotion... While religious organizationsmay not be legally mandated to comply with the other provisions of the ADA, as institutions of faith they should feel a moral obligation to do so. ...Surely full compliance with the spirit of the ADA is a Biblical mandate based on the precepts of love of neighbor and equal respect for all God's children. The Americans with Disabilities Act clearly reflects the principles of love and justice which form the foundation of a life of faith.\"'\"Above all, the implementation of the ADA within the religious community affirmsa political and social vision which seeks to overcome oppression and injustice, the hallmark of an ideological ethic. ...Where love and justice dwell there will be no ...barriers...\"'The World Council of Churches adopted a resolution in Nairobi in 1975 \"whichstrongly affirmed the need for an attitudinal change within the Church:The disabled are treated as weak to be served, rather than as fullycommitted, integral members of the Body of Christ and the human family;the specific contribution which they have to give is ignored.... The Churchcannot exemplify the full humanity revealed in Christ, bear witness to theinterdependence of humankind, or achieve unity in diversity if it continuesto acquiesce in the social isolation of [people with disabilities] and to deny them full participation in its life.\"\"There are a number of unique contributions individuals with disabilities oftenbring to a community of faith. Among the most prominent of these are a spirit ofopenness, simple acceptance (trust), personal warmth and vulnerability. Thesequalities can play an important role in challenging a community of faith to re-examine many of its values and achieve significant growth and learning.\"'The Church has to face a crucial choice: \"either to proclaim and implement thegood news of nondiscrimination and inclusivity to all [people] by breaking down[all] barriers, or to retreat behind concrete, conscious, unconscious and linguisticbarriers which perpetuate brokenness and alienation and falsify the Gospel.\"x\" 'Brett Webb-Mitchell, Ph.D. \"The Spiritual Abuse of People with Disabilities\" in Journal of Religion in Disability & Rehabilitation,Vol. 2 (1) 1995, p. 63.\" Charles Gourgey. \"Disability and Destiny\" in Journal of Religion in Disability & Rehabilitation, Vol. 2 (1) 1995, p. 75.\"' Virginia J.

Many people have not taken time to reflect on their attitudes so are not conscious of how or why they reject people with disabilities.Secondly, the above attitudes are easy to form when disability is viewed from the medical model. This model sees a person only in terms of body partswith a focus on the dis-ability.Christians who claim that the Church is the Body of Christ and who say they are disciples of Christwho healed people at the margins of life andproclaimed justicecannot be witnesses of their faith so long as they holdthese negative attitudes. 1.'William A.

Box 274Lansing, N.Y. 14882-027488 LIVING INTO A SPIRITUALITY Why we need to choose a life of spirituality:So we can move from a life lived in fear to a life of exploring possibility and potential.So we can ask for what we need without apologizing for our lives.So we can share our needs openly and not suffer in silence and/or shame.So we can live simply rather than fragmented.So we can be present to the moment, thus present to the Living God who appearsunexpectedly.So we can create a world of reverence and respect around us. This is to make spaceand time sacred in our lives rather than profane.Spirituality allows one to go against the rules when appropriate and/or necessary.Spirituality allows one to make space for giving energy and creativity to one's life. The Benefits of Seeking the Spiritual Life:You are grounded in God so are more able to give yourself away for others withoutfeeling over-burdened or behaving like a martyr.You gain a sense of your own solitude while being related to community.(This is a necessary aspect for making peace with the inevitability of one's death.)You are able to pull away from the busyness of life to be alone, to enter into prayerwith the deeper inner-self, and thus able to become integrated (healed).An awareness of Self in an intimate relationship with God leads to spirituality.Achieving union with the Beloved (Self/God). \u00a9 1995The Rev.

Look back in orderto look forward again.Know your own personal story: where have you been, where are you, where are youbeing led by God?See your story alongside the biblical stories. The scriptures are our stories:We are, or will, live them in some way in the course of our lifetime. We knowthe places of exodus, exile, famine, war, despair, and the hope of entering apromised land.Allow every story to come to life within you so that you may see anotherperception towards the on-going creative event of your life.Remember that you are in prayer whenever you are consciously includingand inviting God into where you are and what you are doing.Develop a hospitality towards others, self, and each new day.Hospitality is: welcoming others, seeing God in them for you, sharing withthem, entering into a relationship of mutuality where you receive as well asgive.Hospitality towards self is to welcome what you do not like in your own lifein order to deal with it in creative ways which permit God's healing.Hospitality allows us to find new life, love, concern for others, widerinterests, and attraction to new people and places.When you are with another person:0Feel better about yourself & being wanted.0LAUGH, have fun together.0Learn something new because of your time together.0Discover how God is present in your togetherness.Hospitality invites and involves the other so that they may become part of theprocess, first in offering hospitality to you, and then entering into aspirituality for their own lives. \u00a9 1995The Rev.

Box 274, Lansing, NY 14882-0274 STATEGIES FOR PASTORAL CARE OFPERSONS WITH DISABILITIES OR THEIR FAMILIES Be sensitive to how you tell a family their child is disabled should you be expected to do this.It is important to be aware of your own fear of limitation and finiteness. It is OKAY to have troubledealing with your fears.Intervene early with parents; do not wait for time to pass and, damage to occur.Remember that families feel often feel cursed by God because of sin and fate.Be honest, direct, and realistic about their future.Do not try to fix it. Help them to learn how to live with it. Be an advocate as you can, but primarily doministry and then recruit others as advocates.Studies show that families are not looking for technically competent people in the clergy (Heifetz).Look at curative care vs. palliative, remembering that healing begins with how we integrate andaccept what life brings.Treat the situation holistically. Do not treat them as a family of a disabled child. Empower them to bebetter parents or better siblings. Trust your own gut reactions to the family situation. Ask: 'what can Ido for you?'You may not necessarily know you are making a difference. The quality of your care is moreimportant that quantity.Acknowledge within your church community the presence of the person with a disability.Do not desert the family.Do not minimize their reality.Do no harm. Professionals often do harm by not knowing what they are doing with or for thesepersons.Encourage networking support for the family.Provide encouragement in their daily struggle to do what is required for care of their child (i.e. rehabservices, exercises).Remember that siblings feel embarrassed, ambivalent, and guilty. Many are having identity crisisbecause of their sibling with a disability. Help them get in touch with the \"SIBS\" network.You do not need to be a specialist. Your ministry is to be there and to listen.

Nancy Lane, Ph.D. 93 A FEW DEFINITIONS OF HEALING Healing powers consist only in and no more than in allowing, causing, or bringing to bearthose things or forces for getting better (whatever they may be) that already exist in thepatient.'There is a distinction between healing and curing. Donald Senior, a New Testamentscholar who writes about religion and disability writes\"I use the term cure in a strict physical sense, referring to physical transformationby which, for example, the withered arm of the man in the synagogue of Capernum ismade straight. Healing has a more profound and comprehensive meaning, referring notonly to physical transformation but to a profound spiritual transformation as well. Notall peopleeven in the drama of the Gospels have access to cure; but all are invited tobe healed.\"2Healing \"represents a condition of one's life; cured relates strictly to one's physicalcondition.\"' Healing is a continuing process leading one to wholeness and integration.The word \"health\" comes from a root word meaning \"whole.\" To be healthy or whole is tobe integrated and at peace with oneself. Wholeness is founded upon the transformation ofour whole being--of our spiritual and psychological self, of our way of living in the world.John Sanford (Healing and Wholeness) defines illness as \"something that results in amalfunctioning of consciousness\" because the ego is affected. Illness can also be caused bypainful psychological and spiritual distress. Yet, we can also be ill without being aware ofour pain because of unconsciousness. In fact, our level of unconsciousness may prevent usfrom measuring our own state of health--our state of wholeness. If we remember thatscience has now determined that the bodymind/soul are one, then we will appreciate thathealth depends on a holistic balance within, where everything functions harmoniously. COPYRIGHT 1995The Rev. Nancy Lane, Ph.D.A Healing MinistryP. 0. Box 274, Lansing, NY 1488294 The ancient Greeks \"regarded all illness, physical or psychological, as the result of aloss of harmony.\"' One remained well as long as one was in harmony with oneself andwith ones' God. Any illness reflected that one had lost one's balance and was out ofharmony within. This is the view of the ancient Chinese, and Tai Chi is the practice ofrestoring and maintaining balance within the bodymind. However, it was also the viewoften found in the literature of classical spirituality (both eastern and western).Healing also depends on self-image and a persons ability to take care of their ownspiritual and emotional needs thus, many illnesses originate from inner disharmony.Healing seeks to bring bodymind/soul into the harmony essential for health. Findingharmony or balance in our lives requires that we:Let go of whatever causes us dis-ease in life.Examine our motives: are we control freaks? Why?Do we fear being out of control on the inside so take control ofeverything on the outside?Are we manipulative or can we identify what we need in our lives andask for it clearly or go after it in healthy, life-giving ways?Are the activities of our daily lives life-giving or death-making?Things that are death-making press down on us, sap our energy, and prevent feelings of joy(which is not the same as happiness). Anything which prevents us from being who we are isdeath-making.Finally, wholeness does not simply mean a lack of physical or emotionalsymptoms.

Box 274, Lansing, NY 14882 96 TRANSFORMATION One's life cannot be healed unless their are honest about what it would mean to them. Addictivebehaviors and many illnesses can be a means of avoidance. People who do not develop good copingmechanism's use illness as a way of getting attention. Instead of asking for what they need in a direct andresponsible manner, they let sickness ask for them. Addictive behaviors and illness can also be a means ofavoiding people, responsibility, and life. It is a way of avoiding the painful work of growth and transformation,of making hard decisions about changing one's life and oneself. Addictions and illnesses represent animbalance not only in our personal lives, but in the world around us. Both are a call to transformation and newlife, to address what is being avoided in order to be well again. Avoidance leads to dis-order. Healing leads toorder: order allows healing.Our illnesses, addictions, and psychological disturbances are part of the journey toward wholenessand healing. That journey takes us inward and downward in the healing process, where we have to confrontand examine our shadow, or dark side and take responsibility for integrating the neglected or rejectedaspects of ourselves. The following disease model is usually used in discussing addictive or compulsivethinking and attitudes. However, it is an appropriate way of distinguishing negative, dis-eased thinking fromthinking that is informed and shaped by connection to one's spirituality. Whether or not we are able to do thisdepends on our ability to move from living out of a model of dis-ease to living from a model of spirituality (i.e.wellness).

Many of us have anxieties or behaviors which actively block the healing process:Self-defeating or sabotaging behavior.Fear of healing--fear of acting and living in a new way.Fear of the truth.Fear of having to take steps that will change your current situation.Fear of being happy and healthy.2. Are you working well with a therapist? If you have not found one, why not?If you have a therapist, are you comfortable with him or her?If not, have you taken steps to address the problem or to find a newtherapist?What stops you from doing what is best for your future well-being?3. Have you taken time to be still--to listen to the inner voice?Do you take time to reflect on where you are?If you are never silent do you know what you are running from and why?What is it that you do not want to hear?4. What are you doing to nurture your spirituality?Do you know what you are called from? Do you know what you are called to?Have you considered working with a qualified Spiritual Director? \"Healing may not be so much about getting better as about letting go of everythingthat isn't you--all of the expectations, all of the beliefs--and becoming who you are.Not a better you, but a realer you. ...We need to let go, to throw away everythingthat isn't us in order to be more whole\" (Moyers, Healing and the Mind, 354).Healing is about evoking the will to live. \u00a9 1994The Rev.

Box 274, Lansing, NY 1488298 CLERGY IMTH DISABILITIES SPEAK OUTThe following statements, set out by a group of clergy with disabilities, reflect our desire to be self-defined and to have our gifts recognized in positions of visibility. They also speak about our need toprotest labels and patronization.'The negative attitudes of the religious community about disability get in the way ofbringing in the Kingdom of God.Pastoral Care for people with disabilities needs to include advocacy.The issue of the nature of God is raised by the presence of persons with disabilities.There are many who are disabled who can speak to this best when we are visible asdeployed clergy.Living out who we are within the religious community must be made visible by theChurch. Whenever we are honest about our limitations or needs, the Church uses itas a reason to exclude us.We are tired of being told \"God loves you.\" Tell us how you love us. We'll make upour own minds about God!We see ourselves as individuals, not disabilities, but we are seldom included as partof the worshipping or collegial community.Diagnosis has to be dialogical or we become other than you are. We are not ourdiagnosis, nor does diagnosis define our gifts and abilities.We are \"vulnerably strong\" which is to stand in the image of the Crucified Christ.We need to move the religious community from \"toleration\" of us to \"acceptance.\"There are many clergy with disabilities who feel that whenever we get labeled, wemust scream and protest as this is our greatest gift. The religious communityresponds to the protests of many minorities, but they punish people with disabilitiesfor protesting injustice against us. What we feel is a healthy response to injusticeand oppression is still called \"inappropriate\" behavior.When we are told \"you have so many gifts\" a door is being slammed in our face andwe are put at the bottom. If they really believe we are so gifted, wouldn't they makegood use of our gifts by employing us and supporting the gifts?The religious community has much to learn from people who live with disabilities. Those of us whounderstand suffering and who have moved into and through it, can inform the religious community inways which will transform it. These statements were made by clergy with disabilities attending a Methodist conference in 1990. A HEALING MINISTRYThe Rev. Nancy Lane, Ph.D.P.0. Box 274Lansing, N.Y. 14882-027499 THEOLOGICAL QUESTIONS AND ISSUES IN DISABILITY AND HEALINGWhat does it mean to be created in the image of God? 1.What does it mean to be human?2.What does it mean to be whole?\"3.How do we usually define people? (Example: describe a favorite professor; not describesomeone with a disability) How does language reflect our theology? 1.How are labels used to form judgments and stereotypes?2.Do labels fully describe a person?3.Is disability an attribute, e.g. does a person have a disability , or is a person disabled?I prefer to say a person lives with a disability. \"I\" is that part of me that is mind and souland is not disabled. What does disability, illness, suffering, and death say about our image of God?What would it mean if we believed the medieval saying that \"in front of every person there is ahost of angels saying Make way for the image of God! Make way for the image of God! Howmight that impact the way we treat everyone?' Is God disabled? What does it mean to be a communityto be the Body of Christ?> Why are some parts of the Body missinge.g. people with disabilities?There are 45 million people with disabilities in the U.S., or one in five. That has been translatedto one in four church members. One fourth of every congregation lives with some disablingcondition. Where are they? Why?Clergy often feel they do not have time to call on those who are invisible to the churcheventhose who were once active, contributing members who have since become elderly or ill. But acall to ministry is also a call to \"search out those who fall between the cracks of systems andcongregations. ...when you touch and include [the life of one who is currently invisible] you areimpacting a whole family, and often an extended family and other caregivers.\" There are manyfamilies who feel that when the church rejects their child, they reject the parents.2> How can a community be mobilized to respond, care, support families/persons withdisabilities? 1 Gaventa, p. 4.2 Gaventa, p. 12. Disability, Spirituality and HealingDr. Nancy Lane 100 1.Look at how the congregation supports one another: are people w/disabilities included? Dothey have opportunities to provide support to others? 2.Ask what kind of support is needed; do not decide for others what they need or how theyneed it. 3.Don't wait for families and persons with disabilities to ask for what they need if it is obviousthat changes are needed. Ask what would be helpful and then work together to achieve the goal.Too often people have to ask and fight for inclusion in the church, as well as everywhere else.DPractical needs that a congregation may help with: 1.Buying equipment or helping locate it2.Respite care3.Advocacy4.Assisting people in achieving their goals or dreams3 Why is there disability, illness and suffering? How does one make sense of these if one believes that God is loving and merciful? Below are examples frequently cited for the cause of disability: 1.Disability is caused by evil or one is demon-possessed. 2.People with disabilities are \"special,\" angelic, holy innocents, eternal children.This is a fallacypeople with disabilities are as normal as other people in bad behavior,impatience, etc. \"Special\" still means different, and often means segregated, as in specialprograms. To be labeled special \"is dishonest and dis-empowering. Dishonest because it fails torecognize the mutuality of giving and receiving in community and care. Dis-empowering becauseit too often means / am glad you can do that because I can't or don't want to.\"Wherever there is a \"special\" ministry, it is ministry \"to\" or \"for\", but not \"with.\" When there isministry \"with\" then there is a greater opportunity for there to be ministry by people withdisabilities. 3.One lacks faith or would be healed. Who lacks faith?Harold Wilke tells this story: He was walking along the street in NYC when someone approachedhim and said \"My friend, if your faith was strong enough, you could be healed.\" To which Haroldreplied, \"Friend, if your faith was strong enough, I would not need arms.\"Victim theology blames the one who is disabled when healing does not happen. (See my articleHealing of Bodies and Victimization of Persons...) 3Gaventa, p. 13.4 Gaventa, p. 8.Disability, Spirituality and HealingDr. Nancy Lane 101 2 4.It is God'sWho knows the mind of God?Are exclusion and the barriers raised by human beings also God's will?5. The blemished shall not approach the altar of God (cf. Leviticus).6.Whose sin is it?What do we do with this today when human or social behavior causes disability, e.g. fetal alcoholsyndrome, smoking, drugs, AIDS, medications like thalidomide, etc. What does it mean when someone says God does not give us more than wecan bear? Is this a statement of hope and purpose that gives meaning, or is it astatement that implies a lot or resentment and anger at God?5 THEOLOGICAL CONCERNS WHICH NEED FURTHER RESEARCHPastoral Care:\"Just what is pastoral care...with people who are not fixable? What is the role of the pastor whenthe problem is not the disability or limitation but the attitudes toward it, not the individual but thecommunity.It is a place for preaching, visitation, modeling, and empowering people to speak forthemselves.\"'Theology:Disability, disease, and suffering all have implications for our theology and challenge thetraditional images of God. People with disabilities \"raise classical theological questions in stark, concreteways.\" Might we not learn from them more about the deeper mysteries of God and the ways in whichGod uses experiences like disability to teach us about wholeness and healing.8Mission, Outreach and Evangelism:Many churches have signs which say \"Everyone welcome.\" Yet, too many cannot get into thechurch, or once in do not feel welcome or included. \"Reaching out may mean hearing the pain, anger,and distrust from people with disabilities and their families who have been rejected, used, [perhaps]abused by \"religious people\" in the past. It means looking at the call to concrete, specific actions thatcan facilitate and accommodate the participation of people who may need particular supports to beincluded. \"9 sGaventa, p. 10.6Gaventa, p. 21.7Ibid.8Ibid.9Ibid. 102 Disability, Spirituality and Healing 3Dr. Nancy Lane Religious Education:How are we inclusive so that people with differing abilities learn and grow in their faith?Can we re-learn the power of the sacraments to speak to people in different waysno matterhow simple? Can we hear the depth of meaning expressed in the most simple terms? Church History and Polity:\"How can we learn from church history about the ways that churches at different times and placeshave included or excluded people with disabilities. ...the church has sometimes justified social prejudicesand practices, and sometimes acted prophetically against them. We need ... to recover the voices whichhave dealt in this area where people's voices have not been heard. One of the hardest issues to face inthis area combines with ...our understandings of call and ordination, and policies on whether or not aperson with a disability can be ordained.\"10 Biblical Studies:What are the stories, images, and themes that have great impact and power in relation topeople with disabilities and their families?What can we learn from exegesis of scriptures that deal with people with disabilities?\" How can we appreciate scriptural traditions in new ways when read and explored throughthe hermeneutical lens of disability?\"11 PASTORAL CARE I.Be thereat crucial and critical times. At a birth, At a diagnosis. At a first struggle with appropriateschooling and services. At critical transitions, when old and new questions are raised again. Be willing toask questions, listen to the storythe lamentations, the anger, joys, dreams and frustrations. thelamentations, the anger, joys, dreams and frustrations. You do not have to have the answers.12Be present to families or people with disabilities by asking questions and entering the story. By beingthere when it is appropriate and being welcoming when they come to you and to church. II.As a minister, one is always a spiritual guide. Through pastoral care, or perhaps spiritual direction,one walks with others on the path to God. One cannot do that unless they have someone walking withthem and guiding them on the way. ONE MUST PAY ATTENTION TO THEIR OWN SPIRITUAL LIFEBEFORE THEY CAN ATTEND TO OTHERS.Continue to read and reflect on the significant theological questions in life:What is God's will?What is God's purpose?Why is there evil and suffering, and where is God in these experiences?Learn to live into the questions. Learn to live with ambiguity. Life is not black or white and trying to make it that way will lead one away from God. Be willing to wrestle with thequestions of life and with God and encourage your parishioners to do the same. It is thepath of growth and change. 10 Gaventa, p. 23.11 Ibid.12Gaventa, p. 8-9. 103Disability, Spirituality and Healing 4 Dr. Nancy Lane The World Health Organization definitions of disability \"A disability is first of all an impairment. Something biological or physicalhas happened which causes a difference. It could be an extra chromosome. It couldbe a lack of oxygen at birth. It could be another genetic \"defect.\" It could beenvironmental pollution. It could be an illness after birth. It could be an accident.There is a physical basis, even though the root causes of many forms of mentalretardation and some disabilities are unknown.\"Second, that impairment causes some level of dis-ability...the lack ofbeing able to function in assumed, normal ways. Thus, [one] may not be able to walk.[One] may not be able to think as quickly or clearly. [One] may not be able to see....the level of disability is impacted by context. In some cultures or contexts, thesame kind of impairment may be much more disabling than it is in another.\"Third, what do we think about the impairment and disability? What isthe value judgment placed on that difference? That is the \"handicap,\" just as weuse the word in a race or golf game, a socially imposed value judgment about adifference or a lack of ability [which may also be a judgment].\"1 The definition of handicap is that it is an environmental barrier. Stairshandicap people who use wheelchairs or have mobility impairments. Attitudeshandicap people with disabilities whenever they cause exclusion for any reason. WE ARE NOT ALL DISABLED! This is a patronizing and dismissive platitude whichfails to accept the realities of what it means to live with a disability. While we all livewith some form of limitation or vulnerability, we do not all live with the barriers andconsequences of disability. Those who live with disabilities live with different valuejudgments placed on their lives. 1 Bill Gaventa. \"Pastoral Care with People with Disabilities and Their Families: An AdaptableModule for Intro Courses.\" A paperDisability, Bibliography 105 4110 BIBLIOGRAPHY FORDISABILITY, HEALING, AND SPIRITUALITYThis bibliography includes works which address various aspects of living with physical disability,mental retardation, and chronic illness. Many of the sections, including healing, theology, theodicy,spirituality, and suffering include books which do not address disability in particular, but cover the issuesraised by the presence of disability and limitation in the human condition. Most of the books on healing do notaddress disability at all but do speak to healing as a transformative process. Healing and transformation maymean learning to live with a disability rather than suffering from it. Many of the works listed reflect myinterest in Jungian studies and the importance of the relationship between psychology, spirituality andphysiology. Some of the works listed under healing also reflect some of the new study being done on thebodymind which have parallels with Jesus' understanding of the whole person.

The abuse of power has become a poorly understood epidemic in our churches and in society.Poling articulates the problem, the causes, and the consequences. This book is must reading foranyone who has a position of power over others, and for all people who know themselves to bevulnerable or who may have been abused by someone in a position of authority or trust.Sobsey, Dick. Sharmaine Gray, Don Wells, et all. Disability, Sexuality and Abuse: AnAnnotated Bibliography. Baltimore: Paul H. Brookes Publishing, 1991. People with disabilities often experience abuse for years. The magnitude of this threatens theirdignity and rights. In an effort to get the necessary information to professionals, family members andadvocates, Sobsey has gathered a wide range of resources relevant to sexual abuse andexploitation of people with disabilities. A valuable resource for people concerned with abuse.Disability, Healing, and Spirituality(The Rev.) Nancy Lane, Ph.D. 1106 Sobsey, Dick. Violence and Abuse in the Lives of People with Disabilities. Baltimore: Brooks,1994. The reality of abuse in our culture has gained greater recognition and various programs exist toprovide support for people wanting to move out of abusive situations. Sobsey speaks passionatelyand with urgency to the continual silence about the staggering incidence of abuse of people withdisabilities. People with disabilities are generally abused by family members, therapists, or caregiversupon whom they are dependent. Their vulnerabilities put them at greater risk for further abuse sothey are fearful or reluctant to identify their abusers. Sobsey provides clear guidance for identifyingabuse and working to change the social situations that perpetuate abuse. This book is for everyonewho works with and advocates for people with disabilities. ABUSE ISSUES (General):I have not provided separate annotations for the books listed on domestic violence. Noneof them deal specifically with issues of women with disabilities, but speak to the primarycharacteristics of abuse: violation of boundaries, control and domination, instilling fearand low self-esteem, blame, intimidation, and isolation.Davidson, Terry.

Sexual violence continues to be surrounded by silence. The sexual violence of people withdisabilities is not acknowledged or discussed. While this book is meant to help the religiouscommunity understand sexual violence, it is useful to anyone responding to a victim or providingcounseling.Herman, Judith Lewis. Trauma and recovery. Basic Books, 1992. This has quickly become the required text for understanding the nature of trauma and the processof healing. While the book does not address issues of disability, I believe the book has significantimplications for people with disabilities because they experience such a high incidence of abuseeither from family or care-givers, or from the medical profession.Jay, Jeffrey.

Living Well: A Twelve-Step Response to Chronic Illness and Disability.San Francisco: Harper & Row, 1989. Living with chronic illness and disability can cause tremendous emotional pain because of thechallenges, barriers, and losses that one encounters. Emotional pain can be overwhelming,especially if one does not have adequate support. Addictive behaviors are common among peoplewith disabilities, often due to medications and inadequate pain management. Cleveland showshow the twelve steps can help one to see chronic illness as an opportunity for spiritual growth thatleads to acceptance and fulfillment.May, Gerald G. Addiction and Grace. San Francisco: Harper and Row, 1988. This book should be required reading for anyone who has ever been too attached to anything oranybody. May sees addiction as a behavior and a spiritual quest. As a physician, he is able todescribe very clearly how addictions create a memory and response in our brain that must bechanged if we are to recover. May understands both the psychological and spiritual problems thatresult from attachments and develops the relationship between addiction and spiritual awareness.Miller, J. Keith. A Hunger for Healing: The Twelve Steps as a Classic Model for ChristianSpiritual Growth. HarperSanFrancisco, 1991. Miller brings the twelve steps together with biblical teaching in ways designed to help one moveout of self-centered, controlling behavior. He offers a model that fosters spiritual growth as hebelieves addictions are indicative of spiritual problems. The steps are developed in ways that leadone on a pilgrimage toward healing and wholeness. Disability, Healing, and Spirituality(The Rev.) Nancy Lane, Ph.D. dos BIBLICAL STUDIES Borsch, Frederick. Power in Weakness: New Hearing for Gospel Stories of Healing andDiscipleship. Philadelphia: Fortress, 1983. Borsch studies nine New Testament stories that explore \"the relationship between psychologicaland physical illness and health, between sin and sickness, forgiveness and salvation.\" He showshow God is present in a world full of contradictions and paradoxes. The point in understandingthese stories is not about removing disability. Rather, the point is in learning to understand whatwholeness and healing mean for our lives, which often includes living with a disability.Fuller, Reginald H. Interpreting the Miracles. London: SCM Press, Ltd., 1963. \"The biblical view of miracles runs counter to the accepted view of miracle as an occurrencecontrary to the laws of nature...\" In fact, miracles do not prove anything; instead they challengefaith. Secondly, miracles do not have to be extraordinary events. They usually have a symbollic orspiritual meaning which points beyond itself.Govig, Stewart D. Strong at the Broken Places: Persons with Disabilities in the Church.Louisville: Westminster John Knox, 1989. Out of Print but still available throughAmazon.comThis is an important book, written by a minister who has lived with a disability. Govig examines theattitudinal barriers and investigates biblical resources for addressing them. Govig's biblicalknowledge of the healing stories confront the church with the negative issues that have been usedto shut people with disabilities out of the community. He shows how the bible points to theinclusion and fellowship of all people in ministry.Hendrickx, Herman. The Miracle Stories: Studies in the Synoptic Gospels. San Francisco:Harper & Row, 1987. A good resource for serious study of the healing stories and for preaching on those stories.Kee, Howard Clark. Medicine, Miracle and Magic in New Testament Times. Cambridge:Cambridge University Press, 1986. Gives a full historical account of how medicine, miracle and magic were understood in the ancientworld. While this is a scholarly book, it is important for anyone who preaches on the healingstories or is trying to gain an accurate understanding of biblical healingas opposed to themisguided teachings of those who suggest that disability is due to sin, evil, or lack of faith. Disability, Healing, and Spirituality(The Rev.) Nancy Lane, Ph.D. 5110 Latourelle, Rene'. The Miracles of Jesus and the 'Theology of Miracles. Mahwah, N. J.: PaulistPress, 1988. Another historical account of the miracle stories and their meaning as evidence of God's presenceto us. Good for those who are serious students or who are preaching. Serious study of the healingstories can be arduous, but the reward comes in having a more complete understanding of whathealing meansespecially if one lives with chronic illness or disability. Healing is less about theremoval or absence of a disability and more about the state of one's life and soul.Richardson, Alan. The Miracle Stories of the Gospels. London: SCM Press, Ltd., 1975. While this book is also scholarly, it is very accessible to the interested reader. It is also a smallbook but every sentence is filled with meaning. Richardson also sees the miracle stories asintending to awaken faith. This aspect alone takes on significance when one considers how oftenpeople with disabilities have had their faith shattered by the pronouncements of church people.Seybold, K. and Mueller, U. B. Sickness and Healing. Nashville: Abingdon, 1981. Two German scholars survey the Old and New Testament for an understanding of the historicalview of sickness. Their intention is to show that healing has to do with finding meaning insuffering rather than eliminating illness.Stuhlmueller, Carroll. An Old Testament Response to the Challenge from Sickness andDisability. Canfield, OH: Alba House Cassettes, 1991. Carroll Stuhlmueller and Donald Senior team-taught a course on disability and healing in biblicalperspectives at Catholic Theological Union (Chicago). These tapes come out of Fr. Stuhlmueller'swork for that class. His deep understanding of biblical, theological, pastoral and spiritual issuesrelated to disability are reflected here. DEPRESSION AND SPIRITUALITYMost of the following books do not speak specifically to disability. Some of them donot even speak directly to depression. However, they all speak in some way to theissues which contribute to depression: abuse, self-image, loneliness, wounds of thepast, who we are.Berg, Richard F. and Christine McCartney. Depression and the Integrated Lift. NewYork: Alba House, 1981. This is an excellent little book if you can find it. It shows that depression can have a purpose in ourlives if we seek to understand what it is saying to us or asking us to do. Disability, Healing, and Spirituality(The Rev.) Nancy Lane, Ph.D. Bolen, Jean Shinoda. Ring of Power: The Abandoned Child, the Authoritarian Father, and theDisempowered Feminine. San Francisco: Harper, 1992. Bolen is a Jungian analyst, who uses Wagner's Ring Cycle opera to show us the power ofpsychological healing. The opera articulates how the dysfunctional family and the patriarchalsociety are places where the quest for power distorts our relationships. Thus, our ability to speakthe truth or to act on what is true for us is prevented. Once we recognize these patterns we areset free to recognize our feelings and to know what gives our life meaning. Then we are free tospeak our truth and act on it. Accordingly, this is a very significant book for people withdisabilities, whose truth is often denied by those who see themselves as having more power. Ithink this book may also help one to begin seeing that real power is not related to health, money,and job status. Rather, real power comes from withinfrom the freedom to be who one is and tospeak one's truth.Campbell, Alastair V. The Gospel of Anger. London: SPCK, 1986. Essential reading for anyone who has experienced anger personally or in working with others. Anger isoften regarded as a destructive emotionand can, in fact, be destructive. Campbell shows how anger canbe used as a creative power for change. He also talks about anger that is the \"fire of love\"a fire that worksfor justice and love. Many people with disability live with the anger of fighting too many unnecessarybarriers and not having access to places and people that would contribute to a quality of live. If we expressthis anger, we are labeled \"angry\"which serves to dismiss us as persons and to dismiss our need foraccess. This book helps one to see how anger is often the only appropriate response to intolerablesituations and we should not be silenced by those who would use anger as a derogatory label.Clift, Jean Dalby and Wallace B. Clift. Symbols of Transformation in Dreams. New York:Crossroad, 1986. Healing is always about transformation. Dreams are often the guide to what needs to betransformed in our lives. This is a good book for beginners who want to understand their dreams.Both authors are trained in Jungian thought and write with clarity and understanding of how ourspiritual reality pushes us toward wholeness.Furey, Robert J. So I'm Not Perfect. New York: Alba House, 1986. Furey is a psychologist who understands the feelings of shame and inferiority that keep peoplefrom self-acceptance. His chapter \"On being different\" speaks well to the issues people withdisabilities confront on their way to self-acceptance.Houston, Jean and Robert Masters. Listening to the Body. New York: Delta, 1978. Helpful book for learning to listen to your body and draw on your inner resources. The book has anumber of useful imaging techniques for getting in touch with your body. Since people withphysical disabilities are often dis-embodied, this book is a resource for becoming embodied. Disability, Healing, and Spirituality(The Rev.) Nancy Lane, Ph.D. 7112 Houston, Jean. The Search for the Beloved. New York: St. Martin's Press, 1987. Houston uses myth and archetype to understand the spiritual journey to wholeness. A good bookwith exercises for starting the healing journey of transformation.Kane, Thomas. The Healing Touch of Affirmation. Whitinsville, MA.: Affirmation Books,1976. This book is described as a \"psychotheology of affirmation.\" It is an invitation to live in the presentmoment, rather than in the past or fearing the future. Kane's concern for healing arises from thepart that affirmation plays. Affirmation gives strength and depends on the healing touch ofothersthose who accept us as we are. People with disabilities, people who have been abused,often lack the healing touch of affirmation in their lives. This book helps them identify the problemswhich arise from this lack of touch, and helps others to see the importance of affirmation in thehealing process.Kelsey, Morton T. God, Dreams and Revelation. Minneapolis: Augsburg Publishing House,1968. Kelsey is a theologian, Jungian analyst and one who has known disability in his life. His book isconsidered the ground-breaking text on understanding how God speaks to us in our dreams.Luke, Helen. From Dark Wood to White Rose: Journey and Transformation in Dante's DivineComedy. New York: Parabola Books, 1989. Dante's Divine Comedy is the most complete exploration of the journey from despair to union with God thathas ever been written. The journey begins in the \"dark wood\" of lost innocence and wanders throughdespair and blindness until Dante reaches the white rose. This has been called the journey of individuation,the path to consciousness and wholeness. It is a journey of many death and resurrection experiences.Luke is a Jungian analyst who shows us how this journey transforms our lives until we reach a place ofequilibrium in body, mind and spirit.Madott, Bertha Catherine. Sunshine and Shadow: Depression and Spirituality. Paulist Press.McCloskey O.F.M., Pat. When You Are Angry with God. New York: Paulist Press, 1986. A good introduction to understanding one's anger at Godespecially if one is afraid of expressingsuch a feeling. When life appears to be unfair or suffering is not understood, the natural responseis anger at God. Being in touch with this feeling will help us establish a new relationship with God.McCloskey says unlocking the anger about life's unfairness leads us to peace. Disability, Healing, and Spirituality(The Rev.) Nancy Lane, Ph.D. 8113 Moore, Thomas. Care of the Soul: A Guide for Cultivating Depth and Sacredness in Everyday41110Life. New York: Harper Collins, 1992. When one is busy caring for the needs of the body and mind, one may not pay attention to theneeds of the soul. Moore shows us how the wounds of life (e.g. disability, suffering, etc.) arewindows on the soul if we are attentive to the care of the soul. He shows us how to look beyondtherapeutic models of self-improvement until we can sense the sacredness of ordinary life. If youhave never thought about your disability as an occasion for sensing the sacred, let this book be aguide for learning how you might do so.0' Heron, Edward J. Your Life Story: Self Discovery and Beyond. Cincinnati: St. AnthonyMessenger Press, 1993. This is an excellent book for learning how to tell your storyand how to learn what your story meansfor your life.Pearson, Carol S. Awakening the Heroes Within. San Francisco: HarperSanFrancisco, 1991. Iuse this book with my healing groups and it always stimulates deep discussion and insight into howone moves forward or why one is stuck. Using twelve archetypes, Pearson helps us discover whowe are and whywhich helps us in the transforming and healing process. A good book for helpingpeople with disabilities to understand their strengths and how to use them in creative ways.Potter-Efron, Ronald & Patricia. Letting Go of Shame.

They understand how shames disconnects usfrom ourselves, family, and community and leads to despair. The nature of shame is exploredand practical exercises are given at the end of each chapter. People with disabilities internalizeshame for many reasons, including abuse. While the book does not speak to disability, itaddresses the universal experience of shame and thus is very helpful. It is an excellent book.Ripple, Paula. Growing Strong at Broken Places. Notre Dame: Ave Maria Press, 1986. Ripple writes about healing our pain. Pain can be an intolerable companion or it can be a guideleading us beyond ourselves. The book helps one to reflect on suffering and how one can findgrowth through this experience.Rohrer, Norman and S. Philip Sutherland. Facing Anger. Minneapolis: Augsburg, 1981.

Nancy Lane, Ph.D. 114 Rosen, David H. Transforming Depression: A Jungian Approach Using the Creative Arts.New York: G. P. Putnam, 1993. This is the best book I have read about depression and offers concrete hope for the healing process.Rosen understands the purpose and meaning of re-birth in the healing and transformative process.Depression is regarded as having meaning and purpose in calling one to seek meaning to life,mourn the losses, and allow the ego to die in order for the true Self to emerge.Rosenthal, Norman E.

Hasquestionnaire for self-evaluation. Self-help techniques.Saussy, Carroll. The Gift of Anger. Louisville: Westminster John Knox, 1995. This is one of my favorite books on anger. Saucy explores the many dimensions of anger andhow we can use it destructively or constructively. She recommends that we \"befriend\" our angerand serve God through expressions of \"holy anger.\" People with disabilities are often labeled\"angry\" when they express appropriate reaction to the barriers of discrimination and exclusion.The effect is to deny the legitimacy of our anger and to dis-empower us. For those who seekjustice, who refuse to tolerate the intolerable, this is a book to read and remember.Siegel, Bernie. Peace, Love and Healing. San Francisco: Harper, 1990. Siegel is an oncologist who has helped his patients with cancer transform their lives. This bookexplores how the mind influences the body and how this knowledge influences our path to healing.Siegel is not suggesting mind over matter.

Forgiveness: How to Make Peace with Your Past and Geton With Your Life. New York: Warner Books, 1990. Depression is a reminder that something is pressing us down. This is all too often the heavy burdenof the hurt, betrayal, and wounds that we carry. While this book originated around Suzanne'sexperience of incest, it is a wise and profound book for helping one to work through anything whichneeds letting go and finding the healing that comes with forgiveness. Forgiveness is what we do toliberate ourselves and accept God's love. Disability, Healing, and Spirituality(The Rev.) Nancy Lane, Ph.D. 10115 Smedes, Lewis B. Forgive and Forget: Healing the Hurts We Don't Deserve. San Francisco:Harper & Row, 1984. Smedes takes us through the stages of forgiveness: hurting, hating, healing, and reconciliation.He provides realistic answers for forgiving the \"unforgivable\" and talks about forgiving God. Heshows us that forgiving is what we do for ourselvesgetting free of the hurt and betrayal ofothers. One note of caution: the title suggests that when we forgive we should then forget whathappened. Writer's in the '90's suggest that it is very important that we forgive and rememberremember what was done to us so that no one can do it to us again.Storr, Anthony. Solitude: A Return to the Self New York: The Free Press, 1988. Storr reminds us that true health and happiness is based upon our ability to live in peace withoneself.

Storr examines how solitude heals during mourning, periods of stress, and whilesleeping. Above all, solitude is necessary for insight and for tapping into our creativity. For thosefor whom solitude is a daily necessity (rather than chosen) this book can help one to findmeaning to what may feel meaningless.Tavris, Carol. Anger: The Misunderstood Emotion.

FEMINISM AND DISABILITY Browne, Susan E., Debra Connors, and Naci Stern. With the Power of Each Breath: ADisabled Women's Anthology. Pittsburg: Cleis Press, 1985. Although this book has been out for many years now, it remains a book that breaks the silence ofwomen with disabilities.These are the stories that need to be told again and again until theybecome part of the larger story of women. These stories challenge the able-ism that continues to oppress and marginalize women with disabilities.Driedger, Diane,Irene Feika, and Eileen Giron Batres Across Borders : Women WithDisabilities Working Together. Gynergy Books/Ragweed Press, 1996. The women with disabilities movement is at the forefront of partnership and cooperationinternationally.

London: Women's Press, 1996.Hillyer, Barbara. Feminism and Disability. University of Oklahoma Press, 1993. This was a difficult book to read because it is so uneven and the author has a clear agenda: todefend her views as a parent against the views (rights?) of her daughter who is disabled. Onebook review sees the book ending up as a political solipsism\"an inability to move beyond one'spersonal experience and take into account the lives and needs of others.\" Hillyer's antagonism tothe disability rights movement runs so deep that one must ask if she ever understood feminismfrom which the disability rights movement took lessons. Hillyer does not think women withdisabilities should have children, get married, or disagree that \"mother knows best.\" It has beennoted that this book \"will do real damage to any potential for alliances between feminists anddisability rights activists\" (The Witness, June 1994, 29). Disability, Healing, and Spirituality(The Rev.) Nancy Lane, Ph.D. 1211.7 Rousso, Harilyn. Disabled, Female, and Proud! : Stories of Ten Women With Disabilities.(Out of Print) Women with disabilities face a double set of prejudices, based on gender and disability. The worldtoo often sees them in terms of stereotypes: childlike, dependent, incompetent, asexual, unable totake on the role of worker, sexual partner, or mother. As a result, women with disabilities are leftconfused about who they are, and who they can become. In this exploration into the lives of tenwomen with disabilities, Rousso hopes to remedy this confusion. To some degree, all of thesuccessful, adult women profiled in this book have faced these same prejudices about theirpotential at school, at work, or in their social lives. But they have found ways to make satisfyingchoices for themselves despite the barriers, and they invite women of all ages to draw upon theirexperiences to do the same. Rousso encourages and charges women with disabilities to makechoices which go beyond society's stereotypes and reflect their own unique talents, interests, anddreams, while at the same time taking into account their real limitations and needs.Morris, Jenny (ed).

Her bookis eye-opening.Saxton, Marsha and Florence Howe. With Wings: An Anthology of Literature By and AboutWomen with Disabilities. New York: The Feminist Press, 1987. This is an important book because it gives voice to the many experiences women with disabilitieslive withfrom rage and pain, to social dis-empowerment to the triumph of empowerment. Itilluminates understanding and provides a springboard for years of research.Soelle, Dorothee. The Strength of the Weak: Toward a Christian Feminist Identity.Philadelphia: Westminster, 1984. Soelle looks at dehumanizing elements in our society which oppress people. She writes that\"people are still dying today from the indifference of others who do not want rebellion and do notneed resurrection.\" While disability is not one addressed, Soelle's theo-political critique of modernsociety provides a basis for understanding why a disability rights movement in the Church willneed to be radical.

In 1995, Jean-Dominique Bauby was the editor-in-chief of French Elle, known and loved for hiswit, his style, and his impassioned approach to life. By the end of the year he was silent after arare kind of stroke to the brainstem. After 20 days in a coma, Bauby awoke in a body which hadall but stopped working: only his left eye functioned, allowing him to see and, by blinking it, tomake clear that his mind was unimpaired. He was soon able to express himself in the richestdetail: dictating a word at a time, blinking to select each letter as the alphabet was recited to himslowly, over and over again. In the same way, he was able eventually to compose thisextraordinary book.Bauby bears witness to his determination to live as fully in his mind as he had been able to do inhis body. He explains the joy, and deep sadness, of seeing his children and of hearing his agedfather's voice on the phone. In magical sequences, he imagines traveling to other places andtimes and of lying next to the woman he loves. Fed only intravenously, he imagines preparing andtasting the full flavor of delectable dishes. Again and again he returns to an \"inexhaustiblereservoir of sensations,\" keeping in touch with himself and the life around him.Carter, Rosalynn. Helping Someone with Mental Illness. New York: Random House, 1998 This is an important book about living with mental illness and is written to help families, caregivers,and pastors understand mental disorders, their treatment, and the effects on families and caregivers.Concrete suggestions are made on research, treatment, and eliminating negative stereotypicalinformation about mental illness. Disability, Healing, and Spirituality(The Rev.) Nancy Lane, Ph.D. '44119 Charlton, James I. Nothing About Us Without Us : Disability Oppression and Empowerment.University of California Press, 1998. \"The oppression of 500 million people with disabilities is rooted in the political-economic andcultural dime sions of everyday life\", says Charlton. Calling his book part descriptive, partconversational and wholly argumentative, the author observes how oppression and empowermentaffect and change individuals and the community. Charlton's interviews with 45 internationaldisability rights activists and his own observations as an activist recognize the essential theme ofthe disability rights movement: a demand for self control and conditions resulting from the lack ofit. The author's threefold mission challenges existing epistomologies and ontologies of disability.With a close eye on Marxist theory, Charlton explains existing practices and suggests newfoundations, structures and contexts in which to think about the relationships and conditions ofoppression and resistance and to understand and support disability rights.Davis, Lennard J.

Kenny Fries, noted poet, critic, and essayist, has produced a moving and memorable memoir ofwhat it is like to live with a body you are told is less than perfect. Fries was born with incompletelyformed legs, a congenital birth defect that had no scientific name but entailed multiple surgeriesjust to partially correct. In Body, Remember, Fries, with patience and forbearance, travels backthrough his life--examining medical records, family papers, his own and his parents' memories--touncover how he became who he is today. Fries's search is, in part, a mystery not simply becausehe uncovers many details of his early life unspoken within the family, but through its charting ofthe discovery of his sexual desire and identity. While much of Fries's memoir is a beautifullywritten elucidation of what it means to be \"different,\" its fire and heart comes from its author'sgrowing sense of self and dignity as he examines and learns to understand the scars on hispsyche as well as on his body.Fries, Kenny (ed). Staring Back: The Disability Experience from the Inside Out. New York: APlume Book, 1997.

Gallagher's moving autobiographical account traces the growth of his self:understanding and theunfolding of a remarkable career that has opened up many possibilities for disabled and able-bodied people. Gallagher, who contracted polio when he was a college student, writes of hisfeelings and reactions to the iron lung, hospitalization, and rehabilitation. \"His stay at WarmSprings, Georgia, strengthened his body, and a Marshall Fellowship at Oxford strengthened hisresolve.

New York: New York UniversityPress ,1998. From the Foreword by Michael Berube \"...the first comprehensive examination of DisabilityStudies as a field of inquiry, has just been published by NYU Press. In the past twenty years,Disability Studies has arisen to focus an organized critique of the conceptualizations of disabilitythat have dominated academic inquiry. Disability Studies explains disability as a sociallyconstructed category, rather than simply a product of birth or accident. The field offers a means tothink critically about disability, a means that can serve both scholarship and social change.Claiming Disability examines the intellectual as well as the political roots of disabled people'scompromised social position and challenges the academic community to reckon with its own rolein perpetuating a divided society.Claiming Disability looks at the problematic history of society's response to disabled people, andcaptures the exciting changes taking place in the lives of disabled people. Simi Linton commentson the social and political change that is evident in reading the daily newspaper or observingnewlyintegrated primary and secondary classrooms, and also describes the exciting change inthinking about disability, embodied in the field of disability studies. The book points optimisticallyDisability, Healing, and Spirituality(The Rev.) Nancy Lane, Ph.D. 16121 toward the actions of the disability rights movement and the social change it has! brought about,and points to the innovative scholarship in disability studies, both endeavors reshaping disabledpeople's lives, and more broadly shaping a new, more inclusive society. The title, ClaimingDisability, captures the active voice of disabled people in asserting their role in shaping bothknowledge and identity. A persistent call heard from the disability community is: \"Nothing aboutus, without us.\" This idea pervades Claiming Disability, which is critical of oppressive practicesand proactive in its approach to disabled people's self-determination.Mairs, Nancy.

No one, left, right, or center, whoreads this book about the role of the 'disabled' and the 'terminally ill' and the way they are treatedwill come away unchanged. Russell has centered our attitude in a historical stream of thought,which will at first make people stunned and ashamed, and then cause us hopefully to change theway we behave\" (Marcus Raskin )Marta Russell exposes the neoliberal drive to shrink social services with the ReinventingGovernment mantra. \"We are dangerously close to a Jerry Lewis democracy where middlemenbeggars and corporate CEOs getting huge paychecks may replace entitlements with charity,\"reveals Russell in her devastating analysis of the \"reform\" of the social safety net. (A WARNINGFROM AN UPPITY CRIP.) Disability, Healing, and Spirituality(The Rev.) Nancy Lane, Ph.D. 17122 Scary, Elaine. The Body in Pain: The Making and Unmaking of the World. New York: OxfordUniversity Press, 1985. The book begins by considering that \"intense pain is indescribable,\" then moves outward into thepolitical consequences of this inexpressibility. Pain survives in the culture, and can be used as apolitical tool, precisely because of its muteness. This first half of the book, entitled \"Unmaking\",corresponds well to Dante's Inferno. The book's second part, corresponding to Dante'sPurgatorio, describes how humans move out of pain by creating the world of made objects. Thereading of the Hebrew and Christian scriptures that begins this section deserves much widerattention. Scarry reads these texts as an archetypical story of how pain led to creation. Scarrypresents this story with a warm, generous, jargon-free style. The latter sections in each of the twohalves (the first on war, the latter on the texts of Marx) seem to step down from the pinnacles ofeach halfs beginning. The reader can be forgiven for setting down the book at the end of thesection on the scriptures, feeling that Scarry's powerful effect is complete. Scarry's book is awelcome reminder that we are all bodies, and that beneath our divisions of race, class, andgender, we all share a pain that drives us to create our world (Janet Walker).Shapiro, Joseph P. No Pity: People with Disabilities Forging a New Civil Rights Movement.New York: Random House, 1993.This is a wonderful history of the Disability Civil Rights Movement.

We needto bring healing to bear on those hurts or they will control and ruin our lives.Linn, Matthew, Dennis Linn, Sheila Fabricant. Healing the Greatest Hurt. New York:Paulist Press, 1985. Death is often a trauma that we go to great pains to avoid confronting because it involves brokenrelationships with unfinished business. Healing requires us to grieve through the unfinishedbusiness as well as all of the losses involved. This book also addresses miscarriage, abortedbabies, and stillborn babiesissues to often ignored by others so repressed by the mother. TheLinn's provide prayerful and wise guidance to healing these deep wounds of the heart.Moore, Sebastion. The Inner Loneliness. New York: The Crossroad Publishing Co., 1982.

Bolen is a medical doctor and a Jungian analyst, who writes that \"life-threatening illness is a crisisfor the soul.\" This book is about \"illness as a descent of the soul into the underworld and thehealing that can result.\"4 Using the myth of Persephone, Bolen leads one through the shock,fear, anger and depression that comes with illness in an effort to help one ask what is themeaning of life, and how do we find it for ourselves.

Healing Words: The Power of Prayer and the Practice of Medicine.HarperSanFrancisco, 1993.Scientific studies of the efficacy of prayer in healing illness and disease. Eloquentlyintegrates the scientific with the spiritual, shattering the long-held notion that these doctrinesmust somehow be exclusive.Duff, Kat. The Alchemy of Illness. Bell Tower, 1993. A woman of \"mystical temperament\" writes personal, quirky, essays on illness, blending 20th-century psychology with holistic spirituality. Duff, a counselor in private practice, became ill in 1988with chronic fatigue and immune dysfunction syndrome (CFIDS). Because her illness is poorlyunderstood by medical science, Duff questions the Western approach to medicine and health andlooks outside it for answers. Illness, she asserts, defies the rules of ordinary reality and shares in\"the hidden logic of dreams, fairy tales, and the spirit realms mystics and shamans describe.\"This is a world where Duff seems to be exceptionally comfortable. She finds deep significance inher own visions and dreams, and she draws analogies between illness and initiation rites, notingthat each involves a loss and that each may result in a new wisdom, a new power. Some of herconclusions are extraordinary: A meeting with a shaman leads her to the idea that her own illnessis somehow connected to her ancestors' unfair acquisition of Indian land in Minnesota generationsago. Less startling is the link Duff makes between the onset of her illness and her recollection ofhaving been sexually abused as an infant and her subsequent work with this memory in therapy.Readers accustomed to more straightforward accounts may find Duffs musings difficult to accept;still, her insights into common attitudes toward illness, and into the changes wrought in anindividual by illness, are often enlightening.

This book isout of print but worth finding in the library for its theological reflections on suffering and love.Eiesland, Nancy and Don Saliers (eds). Human Disability and the Service of God. Abingdon, 1997. Drawing upon various disciplines and diverse experiences, the authors explore how disabilityaffects the work and ministry of the Church. Biblical texts which speak of sin, disability and healingare examined. Theological reflection is used to explore how people with disabilities could beintegrated in the life and ministry of the Church.Empereur, James L. Prophetic Anointing: God's Call to the Sick, the Elderly, and the Dying.Wilmington, DE: Michael Glazier, 1986. This is one volume in a series that examines the ritual practices and sacraments in the RomanCatholic Church. However, I believe this book is relevant to those who use anointing and who prayfor healing. Anointing gives meaning to suffering, sickness, and death and is a means of healing,especially of the interior ills. A history and theology of anointing is given. The ill and aged have avocation in the Church as they are called to remind others that there is a deeper meaning to lifewhich is often found in the experiences of loss.

Webb-Mitchell gives an overview of how the biblical record has been used to exclude people with disabilities from thereligious community and tells the stories of people who have not felt invited, welcomed or accepted into the life of a congregation. The book is primarily concerned with learning how towelcome people with disabilities and why doing so is essential for the Church. \"For it is only whenwe learn how to be with those who are different from us, and learn how to accept the love of God that we all need, that we will be able to sustain a community that is capable of worshipping God\" (79).

They do not respond to analytic therapies or to tranquilizers.Deprivation neurosis requires affirming love that is more than simple TLC. While the book is writtenby two psychiatrists and is helpful for counselors, it is also a good book for people who are seekinginsights on how issues of deprivation (lack of affirming love) may have shaped their lives. Disability, Healing, and Spirituality(The Rev.) Nancy Lane, Ph.D. 29134 Belgum, David R. What Can I Do About the Part of Me I Don't Like? Minneapolis:Augsburg Publishing House, 1974. (out of print). A good beginning book for those who have not integrated or accepted disability into their lives in ways that reflect healthy thinking.Cousins, Norman. Anatomy of an Illness. New York: Bantam Books, 1979. This famous story is even more significant today as we understand the bodymind connection andits function in the healing process. Cousins used laughter, courage and tenacity to fight against acrippling disease, reminding us that the power of healing (different for each person) lies withineach of us.Cox-Gedmark, Jan. Coping with Physical Disability/. Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1980 (out of print). Written by a chaplain who worked in a rehabilitation hospital, Cox-Gedmark provides insight andguidance for coming to terms with disability. This is a good beginner book for people who have notexplored any of the issues related to living with a disability.Gordon, Beverly S. Toward Acceptance: Prayers for Dealing with Chronic Illness andDisability. Cincinnati: St. Anthony Messenger Press, 1991. Using the twelve steps, Gordon writes prayers that reflect the struggles of living with chronicillness and disability and draw on faith in the power of God to accept what cannot be changed.Frank, Arthur. At the Will of the Body: Reflections on Illness. Boston: Houghton Mifflin,1991. Our wounds give us our narrative power and are evidence of the truth of our story. This bookpresents ill people as wounded storytellers. \"The ill person who turns illness into story transformsfate into experience; the disease that sets the body apart from others becomes, in the story, thecommon bond of suffering that joins bodies in their shared vulnerability\" (Frank, xi). Arthur Frankwrites that the ill [and disabled] offer others the truth in witnessing to their stories. Our stories havemuch to teach society and needs to have an equal place alongside the expertise of theprofessionals. Frank calls this the \"pedagogy of suffering\" (Frank, 145).Harned, David Bailey. Patience: How We Wait Upon the World. Boston: CowleyPublications, 1997. Patience is a virtue but it seems to have very little value is today's culture of narcissism. ProfessorHarned's book reviews the history of patience as formulated by the Church's great moraltheologians. However, this is a readable book for anyone who is serious about understanding howto live with waiting and with learning to transform their impatience into the virtue of patience. Thisis not about patience that is passive in the face of intolerable situations, but of patience that isDisability, Healing, and Spirituality(The Rev.)

Skallagrigg. England: Penguin Books, 1988. Norwood is an award winning novelist in the UK and has a daughter with cerebral palsy. Thisnovel is about people with cerebral palsy in search of freedom. They devise a computer games intheir search for freedom which is based on their own quest for freedom from the variousinstitutions and social barriers. The book also raises issues about self-determination and quality oflife through the characters.This book set me on my own quest for freedom and I found myself going back to the book for avery long time.

The New Orleans Poetry Journal Press, 1984. Vassar Miller was an award winning poet and nominated for the Pulitzer Prize in 1961. She wasborn with cerebral palsy and writes from the perspective of one who understands the pain ofloneliness and rejection. She expands our knowledge of her inner world and enables readers toembrace their own inner world. Vassar was a brilliant, witty women whose literary contributionswere worthy of prizes but who was ignored as a person. She spent decades trying to get herchurch to be accessible to her. In the early eighties I spent a weekend with her as her churchaddressed accessibility. I listened to her and never forgot the impact she made on me. Readerswill be impacted by her words in ways that matter deeply.Nouwen, Henri. Lifesigns: Intimacy, Fecundity, and Ecstasy in Christian Perspective, GardenCity, NY: Doubleday and Co., 1986.Nowen bases this book on the love that is stronger than fear and helps one to move spirituallyfrom fear to love. He reminds us that the angels of God always say \"Do not be afraid\" and theseare the words we hear when God speaks to us. A book for anyone who is fearful, Nouwen speaksvery knowingly about the inner fears that many people with disabilities live with. I know of no othernon-disabled person who has written with greater understanding of many of our experiences. .The Road to Daybreak: A Spiritual Journey. New York: Doubleday, 1988.

He writes of his own struggles as he worked with people who were profoundly disabled anddeeply wounded yet who taught him universal truths about God and the meaning of the Cross.Nouwen, Henri. The Wounded Healer. Garden City, N.J.: Doubleday and Co., Inc. 1979. By learning to pay attention to our own wounds, clergy can help others who live with hopeless andloneliness.Palmer, Parker. The Company of Strangers. Crossroads Publishing Company. Parker Palmer understands the loneliness of the exile and writes about the spiritual journey thatenables the stranger to be welcomed into a community. Anyone who has experienced exclusionfor any reason will find this book helpful in understanding the exile. Those who care abouthospitality will find this book helpful in reaching out to welcome the stranger.Palmer, Parker J. The Promise of Paradox: A Celebration of Contradictions in the Christian Life.Notre Dame: Ave Maria Press, 1980. Anyone who has known suffering has probably asked the tough \"Why?\" questions. The answers aresome times difficult to accept or to hear if we feel we have had more than enough to bear. Theanswers that most of us seek are not clear because they are hidden in the mysteries of God and arerooted in paradoxcontradiction. Learning to live in the tension of the paradox leads one to answersthat remain a mystery but provide the sure hope that God is with us. If you have known abuse,betrayl, despair or doubt, this book will provide direction toward God and healing.Rohr, Richard. Job and the Mystery of Suffering: Spiritual Reflections. New York: Crossroad,1996. \"This book is a spiritual commentary and chapter-by-chapter study of the many themes that occurthroughout the book. In this exploration many questions are raised as much about the reader'sown life as Job's, and from this process is promised deeper understanding.. ...Job witnesses tothe reality of pain, but also to gaining a new sense of joy and freedom and restoration of soul\"(book jacket). If you have ever questioned the meaning of suffering or asked \"why\" you will wantto read this book. It reads quickly and easily but contains deep wisdom for the continuing journey.Sontag, Susan. Illness as Metaphor. New York: Farrar, Straus, & Giroux, 1978.This book attempts to shift a \"blame-the-victim\" mentality away from patients with cancer and TB.Sontag believes that our society saw illness as a metaphor for what was wrong with the patientrather than with society's thinking about illness. Given the more current work on the significance ofthe bodymind connection I did not find the book useful. Disability, Healing, and Spirituality(The Rev.) Nancy Lane, Ph.D. ;! 32137 STUDIES IN THEODICYThese works do not speak to the specific issue of disability but, rather, to theproblem of evil and the related questions about the cause of suffering. Evil is notusually the cause of one's disability but the presence of evil in the world mayhave been a contributing factor or may contribute to the factors affecting one'slife.Cauthen, Kenneth. The Many Faces of Evil: Reflections on the Sinful, the Tragic, the Demonicand the Ambiguous. Lima, Ohio: CSS Publishing Co, Inc., 1997. Cauthen \"interprets the meaning of suffering and the relationship of God to human anguish.\" Hesees that evil and suffering are common human experiences and that evil is a reality of the world welive in. For those who are attempting to understand the meaning of suffering in their own life,Cauthen shows how faith provides hope.Kelsey, Morton. Discernment: A Study in Ecstasy and Evil. New York: Harper & Row, 1978. Discernment is a spiritual tool for learning to recognize and distinguish between good and evil. Evil isa reality of this world and most often is the cause of the betrayal, abuse, and discrimination thataffects many lives. Secondly, too many people with disabilities have heard that evil caused theirdisability or prevented their healing. Kelsey has lived with a disability all his life and while notnecessarily speaking of it, writes with a profound knowledge about the reality of evil and how we canlearn to discern its presence before it harms us.Levenson, Jon D. Creation and the Persistence of Evil: The Jewish Drama of DivineOmnipotence. San Francisco: Harper & Row, 1985. This is an exquisite discussion on the problem of evil in a post-Holocaust era. Levenson analyzesbiblical and rabbinical texts to show the fragility and vulnerabilty to chaos of the created order.Levenson defines God's authorship of the world as a consequence of God's victory in the strugglewith evil. Anyone concerned with the problem of evil will find this a very important work.Sanford, John A. Evil: The Shadow Side of Realihj. New York: Crossroad, 1981. \"...evil isa constant threat for it has the power to possess and destroy the human soul throughwar, disease, and crime. So evil is a problem that ultimately none of us can avoid... Sufferingalways brings the problem with it, and the problem of evil and the problem of suffering arecompanions\" (p. 1). Disability, Healing, and Spirituality(The Rev.) Nancy Lane, Ph.D. 33138 THE PROBLEM OF SUFFERINGChopp, Rebecca. The Praxis of Suffering: An Interpretation of Liberation and PoliticalTheologies. New York: Orbis Books, 1989. A good text book on political and liberation theologies and how they can witness as a praxis ofsolidarity with people who suffer.Claypool, John. Tracks of a Fellow Struggler. Parent whose child dies from a disease. Explores the phenomena of suffering, mourning, coping.Fiddes, Paul S. The Creative Suffering of God. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1988. This is a dense book by an Oxford Don, whom I studied with and whom I admire. Fiddes writes of\"a God who suffers eminently and yet is still God, and a God who suffers universally and yet is stillpresent uniquely and decisively in the sufferings of Christ\" (p. 3). This is a scholarly book, drawingon Barth's Systematic theology and Whiteheadian Process theology to set forth a doctrine of aGod who suffers with us.Fretheim, Terence E. The Suffering of God: An Old Testament Perspective. Philadelphia:Fortress Press, 1984. Fretheim depicts the OT images of God as one who suffers, as one who has entered deeply intothe human situation and made it [God's] own\" (p. xv). Fretheim's elucidation of the metaphors ofGod are critical for understanding how and why God suffers with us.Frankl. Victor E. Man's Search for Meaning. New York: Washington Square Press, 1984. \"When [you] find that it is [your] destiny to suffer, [you] will have to accept [your] suffering as [your]task; [your] single and unique task. ...No one can relieve [you] of [your] suffering or suffer in[your] place. [Your] unique opportunity lies in the way in which [you] bear [your] burden\" (p. 99).Frankl learned in the Nazi concentration camps how to bear suffering and developed hislogotherapy while there. An important book for looking at suffering and beginning to make peacewith the reality of suffering in one's life.Gerstenberger, E. S. and Schrage, W. Suffering. Nashville: Abingdon, 1980. This is a dense, scholarly, sweeping history of the meaning of history as found in the Old and NewTestament. Both authors counter the idea that one is to be resigned to suffering. The faith foundin the people of the Bible show that they struggled against the causes of suffering and, with thecoming of Jesus, find victory over affliction. Disability, Healing, and Spirituality(The Rev.) Nancy Lane, Ph.D. 34139 Girard, Rene'. The Scapegoat. Baltimore: The John Hopkins University Press, 1986. This is the classical understanding of the scapegoat. Girard shows the history of why and howpeople with disabilities serve as scapegoats. I found this work very important for understandinghow scapegoating is perpetuated by patriarchal institutions.Hall, Douglas John. God & Human Suffering: An Exercise in the 'Theology of the Cross.Minneapolis: Augsburg, 1986. \"... the reality of human suffering is the thing to which biblical faith clings most insistently (p. 27)....as Christians are obligated to ask how, according to the gospel of Christ, human suffering is met,addressed, engaged, redeemed\" (p. 30). As one who has spent twenty years reading and reflectingon the meaning of suffering, I found this book to be one of the most important books on the subject.While written from a Christian theological position, the book speaks is concerned with how Godredeems suffering.Highly recommended.Israel, Martin. The Pain That Heals: The Place of Suffering in the Growth of the Person.London: Hodder and Stoughton. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. Dr. Israel is one of the most sought after spiritual guides in England. His wisdom and guidanceare really extraordinary and this is readily seen in his books. This book is not easy for thosewanting an immediate solution to the problem of suffering. Instead, Dr. Israel shows us the valueof sufferingit's potential to assist us in our growth.Moltmann, Jurgen. The Crucified God. San Francisco: Harper & Row, 1974. An important theological study of the theology of the cross. Moltmann says the Church willbecome relevant again only when it takes its identity from the naked crossa cross of sufferingand rejection.Soelle, Dorothee. Suffering. Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1975. Soelle says the issue is not about eliminating suffering but about how people respond to suffering.People who have learned from our society to ignore, deny or dismiss suffering will not respond topeople who suffer. Those who know suffering have the most to teach us about its meaning andpurpose and how we can work to abolish unnecessary suffering. I feel this can enable people withdisabilities to turn their experiences of suffering into stories that can teach others how to either workto eliminate unnecessary suffering or how to face their own suffering.Francis Young. Face to Face: A Narrative Essay in the Theology of Suffering. Edinburgh:T & T Clark, 1990. Francis Young is a theologian and mother, whose eldest child is disabled. She engages the hardquestions about the meaning of life and finds that God does not abandon hereven if God isoften silent. There are parts of the book which made me very uncomfortable (e.g. her language, Disability, Healing, and Spirituality(The Rev.) Nancy Lane, Ph.D.3140 questioning if severely disabled people are really persons). However, the book has much morethat is worth reading. This is a woman who entered the pain and lived into her questions. Shecomes out the other side, wounded but healed.THEOLOGY Eiesland, Nancy L. The Disabled God: Toward a Liberatory Theology of Disability. Nashville:Abingdon Press, 1994. Drawing on the themes of the disability rights community, Eiesland shows that people withdisabilities are a socially disadvantaged minority group, whose history in the Church is veryhidden. Eiesland uses social scientific, theological, and ethical sources to develop a liberatorytheology of physical disability. This book is required reading for seminarians, clergy, therapists,people with disabilities, and churches which seek to be truly inclusive.Moede, Gerald F. God's Power and Our Weakness.

The author speaks about embodiment from as a feminist theologian and makes references to the experiencesof most marginalized people, with the exception of people with disabilities. Her last chapter focuses on thesenses as a way of understanding embodiment, which I see as problematic for many kinds of disability.However, this book contains much that is very helpful for understanding the importance of embodiment if oneis to understand what it means to be whole and to be healedwhile living with a disability.Nelson, James B. Body Theology. Louisville, KY: Westminster John Knox Press, 1992. Nelson offers an incarnational way of doing theology in this unique book. He takes bodyexperiences seriously and views sexuality as central to the mystery of human experience and tothe human relationship with God. He seeks to identify what Scripture and tradition say aboutsexuality and focuses on sexual theology, men's issues, and biomedical ethics.Spufford, Margaret. Celebration: A Story of Suffering and Joy. Cambridge, MA.: CowleyPublications, 1996. Dr. Spufford lives with osteoporosis and has a daughter with a severe disability.

It took many, many yearsto heal from the damage of thoseexperiences.I have never felt aneed to be 'physically healed.Rather,I have needed healingfrom the rejection, abuse andfrustration which came from thenegative expectations and atti-tudes of those who tried to preventme from being all I can Be. Fur-ther healing came in learning tolive creatively and meaningfullywith my disability. This requiredthe deep, inner healing whichcomes from an integration of spirit,mind and body. This healing isthe result of living in faith andbeing enabled and empoweredby the love and acceptance ofothers who lived out their faith inways which brought healing to mylife.Much of my ministry has beenconcerned with issues of healingand persons with disabilities. Themajority of persons who come tome forspiritual direction orpastoralcounseling have experienced thenegative effects of healing expe-riences. This article attempts toidentify the pain of their experi-ences, while also defining whathealing can be for persons withdisabilities.There are many in the Churchby the Rev. Nancy J. Lane, M. Div. who have an obsession withwanting disabled bodies to be\"healed,\" meaning fixed, turnedinto something society defines as\"normal? Disability is still seen asa basic flaw rather than a humanvariation. We have a great needto control anything which we donot want to accept or include inour lives. Persons with disabilitieschallenge society's illusions ofcontrol.There is a distinction betweenhealing and curing. Healing \"rep-resents a condition of one's life;'cured' relates strictly to one'sphysical condition\" (quoted fromBernie Siegel's Peace, Love andHealing). Healing is continuingprocess leading one to wholenessand integration: The word \"health\"comes from a root word meaning\"whole.\" \"Wholeness, or health,is not just an absence of illness ordisability,itis a way of living\"(according to David Eisenberg asquoted in Bill Moyers' Healing andthe Mind). Healing is not alwaysabout being free of illness or dis-ability.It is often about letting goof false expectations and unreal-istic hopes or dreams and becom-ing all you can be. Healing allowsus to live with disability ratherthansuffer from it.Healing in the early Churchinvolved the laying on of hands.There continues to be a powerfulministry, of healing when thecommunity fives in faith that God'swill be done. The efficacy of prayerand caring also have healing ef-fects on people. To care for an-other is to understand, listen toand accept the person you arepraying for.When people areaccepted as they are, they areempowered to move towardwholeness. Wholeness does notalways mean that disability or ill-ness will be removed from ourmidst.The early Church saw healingas a sacrament. People seekinghealing went to confession andsought beingannointed healing heart God'swill. Today, it is often not God'swill which is prayed for but the willof others who decide that healingwill mean our disability will dis-appear. This becomes anotherformof oppression as it pushes usback into guilt, shame and fear ofstigma. This is death-making tothe soul seeking a spiritual life.When churches and prayergroups confine their concern forpersons with disabilities to thehealing of bodies, they are con-descending to the \"medical model\"which only sees disease not per-sons.The healing ministry ofJesus was concerned with thewhole person: body, mind and SEPTEMBER/OCTOBER, 1993 THE DISABILITY RAG RESOURCE 11 14 4BEST COPYAVAILABLE spirit.This meaning has ratherthan persons whoselives are healed. A brief review ofdisability as sin or evil will helpexplain this.A Theology of \"Victimization\"Literature often portrays pub-lic responses to the sight of per-sonswith disabilities in ways whichsuggestthe person represents evilor sin.Consequently, there aremany who see deformities aspunishment for sin. This can beseen in the cultural attitudes whichare still at work in the Church.These attitudes include seeingpersons with disabilities as repre-senting punishment or evil, per-ceiving them as victims, assum-ing that a disabled body means adisabled or inadequate mind, andvaluing persons with disabilitiesless than able-bodied persons.There are Christians whocontinue to use biblical and theo-logical references to blame andvictimize persons with disabilities.They will say faith has notmade well\"; \"You are demon-possessed\"; \"Whose is it you to be born disabled?\";'The blemished shall not approachthe altar (the law from Leviticusused frequently to deny ordinationto persons with disabilities); \"Youare God's special people.\" Scrip-ture and theology used in people apart. This is what Icall \"victim theology.\"It causesimmense suffering and alienationfor persons with disabilities, andeffectively shuts them out of thereligious community.In the gospel of John, thequestion is asked of Jesus, \"whosesin is it ?\" The disciples are at-tempting to blame the man'sblindness on him or his parents.This attitude relieved them of theneed to respond to the man bornblind in ways which heal. Thedisciples failed to express theirfaith or that God was at workthrough them. Jesus did the workof faith and healing when he re-sponded that no one sinned, thuslifting one of the many burdensprojected onto persons with dis-abilities. Jesus says that the manborn blind has the opportunity toexpress his FAITH by demon-strating that God is at work in hislife.What Is Healing?Who is Healingfor?Healing is expected to changethe person who has a disabilityinto one who does not. The bur-den of healing is placed totally onthe person who is disabled,causing further suffering andcontinued alienation from theChurch.I have heard variations of thefollowing story hundreds of times.Only the disability and setting varyfrom version to version. Usually itinvolves a group eager for \"proof\"of healing. This group determineswho and what is to be healed. Italso decides the time-frame withinwhich healing is to occur. Godbecomes a mere puppet dancingto the demands of people whoclaim to know the mind of God.Thus, healing and movement to-ward wholeness is prevented.Instead of acceptance and em-powerment, there is rejection andblame.This particular story is abouta young woman who attended mycollege in the late 1980's. Shewas blind and had never beenaway from home on her own. Thecollege campus is very hilly andspread out. There are many paths,some of which cross over ravines.During the first semester someonewalked with Sue, helping her tolearn the route between the build-ings. Sue undertook this with theexpectation that she could learnher way quickly and become in-dependent. By the secondmester Sue was adjusting tolege and her independencevery well.She developingher autonomy and semester,the prayer group in Sue's dormi-tory prayed for Sue to regain thesight she had been born without.After two weeks, the group de-clared Sue lacKed the faith to behealed and was probably demon-possessed. Her faith and self-confidence were shattered. Thegains Sue had made were irrel-evant in the eyes of the prayergroup.Sue, like many others whohave had similarexperiences, wasleft to deal with the pain and griefof rejection, blame and isolation.Her courage and faith to live withher disabilities had been violentlyshaken. The prayer lives of per-sons in such situations are usualdestroyed and a feeling of abadonment overwhelms them. Theroad to healing has been bombedand they are left stranded in awasteland.Many leave theChurch in anger and despair.The religious community toooften fails to see the many rebirthsof persons with disabilities whichattest to their strength, courageand perseverance. The collegeprayer group failed to see God atwork in Sue's decision to leavehome to study, grow and becomeindependent.Unfortunately there are manypeople who interpret faith as theprerequisite for removing disabil-ity, which is entirely different thanbeing healed.If non-disabledpersons had enough faith to livewith the limitations found in thislife, then they would not need todemand that we have more faith.To live in faith requires that all ous learn to live with the diversityW THE DISABILITY RAG RESOURCE SEPTEMBER/OCTOBER, 1993145 and ambiguity of an imperfectworld where we are not in control.Physical healing is not whatmost persons with disabilities de-sire.Rather, it is spiritual andemotional healing - acceptance,respect and opportunity to bewelcomed and included. Healingcomes when persons with dis-abilities are able to adapt to theirenvironment and their limitations,enabling them to live full andmeaningful lives.Healing is overcoming the fearof limitations and recognizing giftsand potentialities of person withdisabilities.Healing comes inrecognizing our own limitationsby touching the wounded placewithin and encountering God.Healing is accepting the unac-ceptable, accepting each other'slimitations and then rejoicing in allthat we have been given. Healingis responding to God's love atwork in and through the limitationsof our lives. To be healed is to livein faith and hope, believing thatnew life comes out of sufferingand loss.The ministry of healing shouldalways enable and empowerpeople to live with their disabilityin creative and living-giving ways.Healing comes when we are loved,accepted and empowered to bewho we are.It comes throughfamily, friends, lovers, colleagues,as well as through doctors, nurses,clergy, or social workers. Healingis an ongoing process. There aremany, many persons with dis-abilities who need the healingpresence of the Church. Likewise,the Church needs the healingpresence of persons with dis-abilities to teach them about livingwith faith.1 The Reverend Nancy J. Laneis currently a Ph. D.

Lane This paper explores why women with disabilities need tolearn and understand their stories as part of the spiritualjourney. Spirituality teaches us to live into our stories, wherewe find empowerment and freedom to transcend disabilityand re-create a positive self-image. Negative self-imagescontribute to the myths about who we are. As we come toknow the myths we have lived with, we are enabled to shat-ter them and change our lives. The spiritual journey teachesus to live with rather than suffer from disability. We learn toBe who we are with our disability, while also Becoming allwe are created to be by discovering our gifts and full poten-tiality.4eyomprehensive studies of the last decade which examinety's discrimination against women with disabilities findtare oppressed and devalued more than most minorities(Sobsey, Grey, Wells, Pyper, & Reimer-Heck, 1991). A studytitled looking glass: The Church's response topersons with disabilities,\" demonstrated this is true in mostChristian denominations (Heifetz & Chaffee, 1985; Chaffee,1986).I am a woman who has lived with cerebral palsy for 50 years.Iam also an Episcopal priest who has studied classical Chris-tian spirituality and who seeks to live it out in my daily life. Igrew up in the Church and have given my life to God, yet I toohave experienced discrimination and oppression. The spiritualjourney continually transforms both myself and my experien-ces, allowing me to Become more than I was as a dis-abledwoman.Although much of what follows may apply to men with dis-abilities, I have intentionally confined myself to discussing thespirituality of women with disabilities. This is the ground of myown experience, as well as the focus of my doctoral research. Ihave long advocated that persons with disabilities are the ex-perts of what it means to live with disability and our voices needto be heard. Therefore it would be presumptuous of me to speakabout the spirituality of men with disabilities.Unlike men with disabilities, women are doubly and triply op-ressed by negative prejudices and stereotypes, in addition toeconomically disadvantaged (Minnesota Coalition forered Women).Society places a higher value on physical appearance inwomen then in men, thus adding another disadvantage to BESTCOPYAVAILABLEwomen with disabilities. They \"are encouraged to be helpless,nonassertive, non-sexual, passive, dependent, grateful andapologetic for a less than perfect body...\" (Cole, 1988, p, 284).Women have been defined as \"biologically and morally defec-tive males\" for centuries (Ruether, 1975, p.15). Thus, it is doublypainful for women with disabilities to face those aspects of our-selves which others have labeled unacceptable, wrong,deficient, deformed, aberrant, or deviant. How can one ever be\"normal\" when one is defined as imperfect? How can one beginto understand healing and wholeness when \"religious\" peopleclaim that if one had more faith, one could be healed, that is,meaning without one's disability?There are many women with disabilities who have no idea ofwhat it means to integrate disability. They see their disability aslarger than life, letting it define them rather then being an in-tegrated dimension of living. When disability is not integrated,it is dragged along as a heavy weight and may be used to batterself and others, preventing personal and spiritual growth.It is important to understand one's disability, its' causes andconsequences as much as possible. Then we can begin to in-tegrate our experiences, recognizing that suffering,disappointment, hurt, and rejection are not exclusive to us butare universal conditions. Disability is not a condition separatefrom the experience of being a human being living in a brokenand fragmented world. Understanding one's disability alsomeans exploring the dimensions of one's self-image, doubts andfears, dreams and hopes.Many women with disabilities develop only a fraction of theirpotential. We are often familiar with our limitations, and wemay succumb to using them as the boundaries within which wemove. Yet we have been created with potentialities beyond ourimagination. Spirituality is one way of discovering the pos-sibilities, while integrating the limitations of one's disability.Defining Classical SpiritualityClassical spirituality and spiritual direction is evidentthroughout civilization. Whether it is the ancient sages ofJudaism, Socrates in Greek philosophy, or the religions of Indiaor China, the care of the soul was the essence of coming to\"know thyself\" (McNeill, 1951).Soul is considered the essence of human personality and re-lated to the body. Early spirituality interpreted biblicalscriptures in light of Greek philosophy, which tended to dividehuman beings into body and soul. The body was intrinsicallyevil. Thus a negative attitude towards one's body was an easyprojection toward the disabled body. Spirituality has to do with14753 Journal of Applied Rehabilitation Counselingintegrating body and soul into a unified whole and under-standing the body as good. How we see our disabled bodiesdetermines the health and growth of our spiritual life.Health and healing ultimately is the well-being of the soul. Thefunction of therapy is essentially guidance of souls toward heal-ing. In this sense the therapist is the shaman, healer, sorcerer,priest and teacher (McNeill, 1951, p. vii).Spiritual Direction is applied to the care of souls who seek toknow God's will for them. It applies to the spiritual life of thewhole person (Leech, 1977). Cering for one's soul enables one to recover the sacredness of their life, and to live with theparadoxes of being broken yet whole. Spiritual Direction em-powers one to take back what has been disowned and to finddeeper respect for what is actually there (Moore, 1992). Themystery of suffering can become the source of one's healing.God is the term used by classical spiritual theology and mys- tical religions, both East and West. Essentially, God isincomprehensible and deeply mysterious, the ground of theself, the ground of being, the unfathomable depth (Leech,1985). Self-knowledge is knowledge of God. Ultimately we dis-cover God in the depths of our own soul, where we discover theSelf. I have therefore referred to God in some instances asGod/Self. This image is an Jungian archetype which expresses the Self as the integration of physical, psychological andspiritual, e.g. soul.The spiritual journey always includes:two constant pulls: forward in faith to the unknown andbackward to the slavery of the familiar. Spirituality allowsus to break free so that in the transition between those twoplaces we find ourselves and our creativity. The life of faithconsists in moving with God in terms of a) being securelyoriented, b) being painfully disoriented, and c) beingsurprisingly reoriented (Brueggemann, 1978).The purpose of the spiritual journey is to move us from ourfamiliar world, into the abyss, and out again into the Light wherewe find ourselves transformed by inner healing.Spirituality is meant to free us from all those things which en-cumber us. Movement through the spiritual journey requires usto Be who we are, and to Become all we are, To \"Be\" who weare requires knowing ourselves as more than our disabilities,living with them, rather than suffering from them. We are \"Be-coming\" more fully who we are as we journey. This is the processof encountering God/Self at the center of the struggle, and dis-covering the potentialities and abilities which are greater thanour disabilities, The spiritual journey discussed here refers tohow women with disabilities come to know who they are aswomen, who happen to be disabled.Why Women With Disabilities Benefit From SpiritualitySpirituality can enable women to do the following:a. Move from fear to possibility and potential;b. Ask for what we need without apologizing for our lives;c. Share our needs openly and not suffer in silence orshame;d. Become integrated as opposed to being fragmented; 54e. Create a world of reverence and respect around us,making our lives sacred rather than profane;f. Spirituality allows one to go against the rules when ap-propriate or necessary. As long as we live in an inacces-sible, discriminatory, and/or hierarchal world, it will benecessary to break rules in order to create change;g. Spirituality allows one to make space for creativity inone's life.The spiritual journey calls us to begin a new phase of growthand change, leading to inner healing. One sign of a healthy per-son is the seeking of new experiences and expanding one'sawareness rather than merely surviving. Finding wholeness in-volves the transformation of our spiritual and psychologicalself. The spiritual journey \"is a journey into darkness as well aslight, into strangeness as well as intimacy, and in which we aremade new\" (Davies, 1989, p. 1461).Learning One's Story: Beginning the JourneyEach of us has, and lives, a story. Knowing one's story is animportant part of the spiritual journey. Yet, one has to beginthe spiritual journey before one can fully know and understandone's story. Too often the stories of women with disabilitiesremain untold. Women with disabilities need to understand andtell their stories. Others need to hear our stories before theycan walk with us on the journey toward healing.Our stories are usually a series of sub-plots, detours, exodusand desert experiences. Society has long labeled, stigmatizedand marginalized women with disabilities. Thus, we often set-tle for living the stories, roles and expectations in which we havebeen defined. In telling our stories, we come to understand themyths in which we have lived and so are able to shatter themand change our lives. We are likewise enabled to reflect on thegrace-filled fragments of our lives, and discern how God/Self iscalling us (Fortunato, 1982).Community of Faith: Supported or AbandonedA young woman who was blind entered a women's collegeduring my senior year there. Sue had never been away fromhome before. During the first semester someone walked withSue, assisting her at meals, and helping her learn the layout ofthe buildings and grounds. Sue undertook the task with the ex- pectation that she could learn her way and becomeindependent. By the second semester she was doing very well.Sue (and many others) felt she had become very accomplished,and was developing autonomy and actualizing more of her God-given gifts.During the second semester, the prayer group of her dor-mitory began praying for healing for Sue. They prayed that Suewould regain the sight she had been born without. After a fewbrief weeks, the group announced Sue lacked faith to be healed,and was possibly demon possessed. Her self-confidence wasshattered. Sue's accomplishments were irrelevant in the eyes ofthe prayer group, diminishing who Sue was. They had failed tosee the Creator/God at work in her or \"God's strength mademanifest in weakness\" (cf. II. Cor. 12:10).Women with disabilities have to live with the limitations im-posed on them by their disability. Unfortunately they are also Volume 23, Number 4, Winter 1992expected to accept the negative attitudes, the barriers, and thespiritual blasphemy of others. People without disabilities arenot expected to accept the presence of disability in others, inorld, or the possibility that one day they will be disabled.e road to discovery for one who is a person with a disabilityis difficult and painful. It is crucial for counselors to hear thisbecause so many people do not think about the spiritual jour-ney of persons with disabilities. Disability is affected, for betteror worse, by the spiritual dimensions of one's life. The pain ofbeing disabled is exacerbated further by the pain of rejectionand struggle caused by negative attitudes toward us. Soul-painmagnifies physical pain, while physical pain magnifies soul-pain. Many women (and men) learn to ignore or block theirpain, but pain can suddenly overwhelm and dominate theirworlds. When pain dominates body and soul, the need for thereconciling and healing love of others becomes critical.People in pain often experience \"abandonment by God\" andisolation from the Church. Too often, they decide that dis-ability, loss, and grief invalidate any possibility of belief(Cox-Gedmark, 1980). Faith is supposed to provide a back-ground of words and responses, symbols and actions whichcreates a framework of support. Finding this framework mayrequire the support and encouragement of the counselor. Itmay or may not be found within organized structures of faith.Communities of faith and support can develop from peoplecommitted to sharing the journey with each other.Entering the Abyssarspiritual journey begins with the quest to know who wend a willingness to enter the abyss within to find ourselves.Entering the abyss is to encounter the desert, where we dependupon our Creator to nourish and strengthen us. Here, in thedepths of our Being, we can listen to the voice of God/Self, whocontinually calls us to Become all we have been created to Be.This encounter gives meaning and purpose to our history,provides direction for our present, and calls us toward a future.We encounter our history in the abyss, where \"nothing ischanged and everything is changed\" (Keen, 1970, p. 22). Theonly thing different is our perception. We must look at thememories and experiences of the past, which have shaped us inmany ways. We repress many feelings in an effort to deny pain,suffering, anger, guilt, or grief. We try to bury things that arenot really dead in us. When issues are left unresolved, they lurkin the shadows, surfacing in disguised ways as anger, passivity,fears and as doubts of our self-worth and our real abilities.Negative attitudes about ourselves rise up out of the debris ofpainful memories. For persons with disabilities, thesememories often include ridicule, rejection, and social isolation.We encounter the loneliness and anger of our experiences ofbeing disabled. We also feel more deeply the yearning for af-fection, acceptance, and affirmation of who we are beyond ourdisabilities. Avoiding these many feelings may cause us toremain stranded in a spiritual wasteland. We must look at ourgs and come to understand them in new ways.e remain victims of our past, we continually rebel or react.,perhaps we appear to \"accept\" it and then act resentfullytoward the world for imposing the \"unacceptable\" upon us.However, we are not called to be victims. The spiritual journeytransforms any prior need to be the universal, suffering victimand allows us to take our place in a world which knows suffer-ing universally.Too often people with disabilities fail to expand the boun-daries of limitation because they may have learned to say I\"can't.\" Many women with disabilities say \"we can't\" for all thewrong reasons. We are what we believe we are. If we believeourselves to be dependent, helpless, useless, worthless (dis-abled or not!) then we will be or become so. We are so afraidof defeat that often our fear renders us incapable. All of us arecapable of more than we think we are.We discover our limits only when we expand within to movebeyond them. When we say \"we can't\", we are saying we will notrisk defeat, pain or conflict. We are saying that we will not enterthe struggle, we will not encounter God/Self. Life will pass usby without our having experienced the fullness of life. We willbe unable to integrate the limitations of life, and we will neverknow those moments of hope which are contained in the pos-sibilities given to us. Our Creator/God has created us withthousands of potentialities in every given moment of time.When we are enabled to embrace our limitations, we discoverthe infinite potential within, the gifts which may be hidden orburied. To say! \"can\" takes a certain security which comes fromwithin oneself, and is nurtured by the unconditional love ofGod/Self and the love of another who walks with us on the jour-ney.The Cycle of Grief in DisabilitySeveral years ago I was asked to explore dimensions ofspirituality with a group of women with disabilities. I asked eachof them to tell ne about their spirituality. Each of them were lostin a desert, their spiritual journey dead-ended. They werestranded by feelings of shame, anger and grief which they didnot understand. They believed there was something \"wrong\"with them. They had little understanding of their disability otherthan being defined by it, As with most of the women whom I seefor pastoral counseling, they had not integrated their disabilityinto the totality of their personhood.In the last nine years I have worked with a number of suchgroups of women, as well as with individual women with dis-abilities. Consistently, I have found these women to beexperiencing the various stages of grief. No one has identifiedthese stages or encouraged the women to work with endthrough them. Women with disabilities can benefit enormous-ly through the process of grieving the loss of hoped-for orperceived images and abilities. There are times when we \"ac-cept\" disability and go about living. At other times weexperience the grief and depression which is normal to any kindof loss. Frustration with barriers, discrimination, and oppres-sion contribute to the loss and grief. It is important forcounselors to recognize that women who are disabled gothrough the grief cycle many times in the course of a lifetime. Itis normal; it will pass. It is not to be avoided for it is a significantpart of the spiritual journey. We must understand our grief,frustration, and anger if we are to move through it and beyondit.1 4 9 BESTCOPYAVAILABLE55 Journal of Applied Rehabilitation CounselingGrief is a circular staircase. In a circular process, feelings con-tinually mingle with issues and images in constant recirculation,until someone helps the grieving one to step out of the loop.There seems to be an inevitable, isolating, barren aspect ofgrief. One can feel locked into a repeated pattern of remem-bering the loss, especially if one's everyday life is structuredaround the reality of loss because of one's disability, e.g. im-paired or missing limbs, compromised health, mobility issues,discrimination and/or access issues related to making careerdecisions, and limited choices at every level of daily living. Isola-tion is deepened by exclusion from equal opportunity and fromsocial occasions. Spirituality can enable you to understand theplace you are in as you explore and mark the boundaries ofwhere you are in your journey. In grief, one is often in the desertor the wilderness. Here one can re-envision isolation and loneli-ness as a gift which leads to deep, inner healing.Anger and Forgiving GodWe rarely talk about being angry at God. Many people feelanger is wrong or sinful so their spiritual development grindsto a stand still. Unexpressed anger cuts us off from God/Selfand prevents inner healing. Acceptance of what is or of whatcan be is prevented.The search for identity in women with disabilities is a quest toresolve the inner conflict between spirit end flesh, betweenidealized self-image and physical reality, between being asojourner or a victim. It is the conflict of being seen and treatedas a child when you are an adult; of being judged as saint or sin-ner, special or condemned, chosen or ignored. Until theseconflicts are resolved internally, you are not able to convinceothers that you are a companion on the same journey, an equal,and made in the image of God. Resolving these conflicts re-quires accepting the feelings, fantasies, needs, attitudes, andfears that are a part of our personalities. We are many thingsbesides being disabled, some of these are positive, and someneed working on. Keen (1970) notes that:When...forbidden emotions are recognized as a part of theself the energy which had been used to keep them out ofawareness and to prevent them from being acted upon isreleased and becomes available for other purposes. Angerowned and symbolically acted upon may be domesticatedand turned to productive uses (p. 64).We are all wounded, some with visible wounds associated withvarious disabling conditions, others with invisible wounds of theheart or soul. Spirituality cannot develop and grow unless ourwoundedness and limitation are acknowledged and broughtbefore our Creator/God. It is in the midst of the anger andstruggle that we become able to accept living in an imperfectand fragmented world. As we wrestle with our finiteness andlimitations, we encounter the One who gives us strength to livewith, rather than suffer from our reality.The pain of living with a disability can be like a hurricaneraging inside of us. The wind and rain pound, battering the soul,flooding the gates to freedom. To carry this anger alone insideis to suffer, and perhaps to cause suffering around us. It is im- 56portant to vent this anger in safe ways. Counselors can providesafe places, and can encourage clients to express their griefand/or anger to and at the one whom they call God. They needto know it is alright to question and wrestle with God about themeaning and purpose of their lives.I was never afraid to rage at God. I knew God would absorbmy anger and the healing I wanted would come only after theraging storm. I just was not able to \"let go\" of my anger so thatI could actually vent my rage. The \"letting \"go\" happened whenthe pain drove ne to cry out to God to take my disability fromme.I was very angry about having cerebral palsy and angry withthe attitudes of others toward me. I screamed all of this at Godand cried for several hours before falling asleep on my livingroom floor. In the morning I awoke feeling very still within. Itwas very clear to me that I had \"wrestled with God/Self' in thenight and had been changed by the experience. I began to seemy \"woundedness\" as a part of the whole of who I am.In the darkness of the soul journey, we are confronted withthose realities which are ours alone. Alone with our fears anddoubts, we are left to face the agonizing struggle. Counselorsworking with persons on this journey must help them to pull theshadows of doubt, shame, and fear into the light. Seen in a newlight, these feelings can be turned into new insights and new un-derstandings of who we are, where we have been, and where weare being called to. It is only when we touch the woundednessof our lives that we are able to move toward healing...andtoward Becoming. To Be who one is to recognize and acknow-ledge one's limitations in order to be used by God/Self.We can accept the limitation and suffering of disabling con-ditions as given and celebrate life in the midst of it, or we canbe victims who suffer with, as opposed to living with. We havea choice in accepting or rejecting life as it comes to us. We canchoose how or if we will get on with the business of living whenthe unexpected and unwanted occurs in our lives. Few of us\"like\" what happens. Our choice is in how we react to disabilityor limitation, and arises out of our willingness to Be who we areand Becoming all we are meant to Be.An encounter with God requires a personal relationship withGod/Self, where we are able to talk about FORGIVINGGOD/SELF, We cannot accept forgiveness from God/Self orone another unless we are also able to give forgiveness. In for-giving God/Self, we acknowledge living in an imperfect world,while entering more deeply into the mystery of God. We do notknow all the reasons why things happen.When we forgive God for our disabilities or limitations, we be-come free to integrate those parts of ourselves which we havebeen ashamed or unwilling to accept. We accept them as partof God's creation and not as mistakes or punishment. In accept-ing ourselves we achieve wholeness and find new freedom.Forgiveness in the spiritual journey is an on-going processrather than a pronouncement of something done. Forgivenessrequires activity on our part, a reflecting on what has happenedto us, and then naming it, and working toward letting it go. Ifwe have been injured by severity or indifference, by being lovedtoo little, too much, or unwisely, we become free of these woundsonly when we recognize them, name them, and forgive both Godand the persons responsible, including ourselves, for inflicting150BEST COPY AVAILABLE Volume 23, Number 4, Winter 1992them (Keen, 1970). Forgiveness allows us to accept what is pastand cleanses away those feelings which poison us. We can thenourselves of self-destructive, self-defeating tendencies.Finding Meaning in the PainLooking at the pain within can be a \"dark night of the soul\" ex-perience (Kavanaugh & Rodriguez, 1979). With these timescomes more pain and grief, struggle, fear, and confusion. It isonly in facing the pain that we see it for what it is; when we callit by name it loses its' power. Pain can turn into negative angerwhich becomes violent and destructive; or pain can enlarge usas we allow it to transform us. Pain can be like \"the refiner's fire\"which turns dross into gold. It can become a creative forcewhich makes a difference in the world around us.God absorbs and transforms pain into a life-giving power. Wefirst have to surrender the self in order for the redeeming powerof God's love to heal all pain. The spiritual journey ultimatelyis about death of the old self and birth of the integrated Self.When we finally know ourselves to be broken and shattered, weno longer struggle against the life-giving power which calls usforth. It is in the shattering that we discover the freedom to beall we are called to Be.In Bernstein's symphony Mass, we hear these words: \"shat-tered glass shines more brightly...\" There are many sides toshattered glass, exposing all to the light, and reflecting a bril-liance of color. I believe we can allow the broken shards of lifeto continue piercing us so that we bleed to death, or we canreflect the complexity and beauty of God/Self in our broken -andand glisten in the darkness of this world.s we emerge from the darkness of the abyss, we begin to seeour gifts. We are able then to reach forward and do the best wecan with what we have, and then to reach back in order to helpothers with their understanding and acceptance of disability inus and in themselves.Healing and the Presence of DisabilityIn order to love ourselves, we first have to accept ourselves aswe are, with all our particular limitations, difficulties, gifts, andquirks. Keen (1970) notes that, \"We can only accept otherpeople if we have first freed ourselves from everything that op-presses and estranges us, and from everything that makes ussmall and ugly and worthless in our own eyes\" (p. 137).My own spiritual journey meant learning to understandcerebral palsy and integrating and accepting my limitations,while also discovering my gifts and abilities. Psychotherapy andSpiritual Direction enabled me to understand my grief, anger,and frustrations. As I moved into and through the pain, I beganto see my gifts, to grow spiritually and Become more fully whoI am. I learned that I am in the image of God, created withabilities and potentialities. This meant finding new and positiveimages of who I am, yet integrating my experiences of disability.This process was the beginning of re- defining myself as awoman who is a priest, a mother, a student, and a serious cook,happens to be disabled. Disability is no longer my definingracteristic; it is not who I am.The spiritual journey required me to integrate the experienceof living with a disability into my priesthood. I had to bringcerebral palsy with me, not as an unwanted appendage, but aspart of the wholeness of who I am. God called me, as I am,without excuse or apology, and not as who I might have been,or how I wished to be. It is through loving oneself, through livingfully with that which cannot be changed, that one becomes em-powered to change that which can and must be changed fromwithin.There are many, many women who live with disability, andthat should be the message of a lived out hope. Faith lived outmay be most visible in persons with disabilities who endure thestruggles, accept the challenges, and continue to face life in allits ambiguity. It is faith which allows us to live with the realityof our lives.Unfortunately there are many people, who like the collegeprayer group, interpret faith as the prerequisite for removingthe disability, which is entirely different than being healed.Their prayers place the burden of being \"healed\" on the personwith the disability. Healing is expected to change the personfrom one who has a disability into one who does not. Physicalhealing is not what most persons with disabilities desire. Ratherit is spiritual and emotional healing -- acceptance, respect, andopportunity.Healing comes when persons with disabilities adapt to the en-vironment and to their limitations, and live full and meaningfullives. Healing is living with our limitations where necessary,while also being challenged to accept them when possible. It isclaiming our faith that enables us to live withthe reality ofbrokenness and imperfection. To be healed is to live in faith andhope, recognizing and believing that new life can come out ofsuffering and loss.Healing occurs when family, friends, Church/Synagogue andcommunity affirm and accept our presence by removing thebarriers, recognizing our abilities, and receiving our gifts. Heal-ing comes when all of us accept the reality of the disability aspart of this life. To be healed is to accept the unacceptable,knowing in faith that God is present in the midst of suffering,loss, and the unexplainable.Healing provides spiritual well-being yet leaves us to face thesetbacks and struggles which limitation inevitably brings. Attimes we will encounter the desert and become depressed anddiscouraged. These times are part of the healing journey. Heal-ing is an on-going process and we must be patient; so must thosewho walk with us.Companions On the WaySpirituality calls women with disabilities to live life fully andcreatively. How we do that depends upon our being reconciledto ourselves as we are. Living in the present comes out of anawareness that all of our life is sacred. If we live fully in thepresent, we have accepted ourselves for who we are, and greeteach moment in time with our full presence. We sanctify bothtime and space by our Being-who-we-are in the world. This islife lived in hope..and expectation. Anything less is to enter intothe despair of a life in which there is no meaning and no pur-pose.andwho walk with us on our journey toward God/Selfand healing are not required to give us answers. Your presence151BEST COPYAVAILABLE 57 Journal of Applied Rehabilitation Counselingrequires the ability to be silent in the face of the unexplainable.The ways of God are a mystery. You and I have to be able tostand in the center of that mystery, sometimes in silence, some-times angry, but together. To do that, each of us must be ableto touch our own woundedness and know God/Self there. Untilwe can do that, we can not be fully present with other's on theirjourney. To be present is to hear and receive the stories ofwomen with disabilities and be changed by them. As we tell ourstories, we are empowered to Be who we are as women...whohappen to be disabled.ReferencesBrueggemann, W. (1978). The prophetic imagination.Philadelphia: Fortress Press.Chaffee, N.

All rights reserved. Copyright 1995 National Council on Rehabilitation Education A Theology of Anger WhenLiving with DisabilityNancy J. LaneElmira, New York Abstract. People with disabilities who actively and vocally challenge the barriers and attitudes in a non-disabled society are often labeled \"angry.\" This article examines whyanger is necessary and how it empowers people to seek justice and equality in their efforts to live a full and active life. The first section reviews the psychology of anger and discusses how anger can become destructive when the losses and needs of people with disabilitiesare repeatedly ignored. The second section discusses expressing anger at God and forgiving God as important aspects of the faith journey. One's ability to question God is in direct relationship to one's relationship with God. The reasons for forgiving God are also explored as forgiveness is an important element in every healthy and deepening relationship.Expressing one's anger is an important step toward spiritual and psychological growth.However, we do not usually think of expressing our anger at or with God. Many peoplestill think it is wrong. Yet we cannot be in relationship with God if we are unable toexpress our deepest feelings. Anger is a powerful emotion that can wreak destruction in our lives, or it can become a raw energy that fuels our quest for justice and equality. A theology of anger enables us to question God, wrestling with God as it were, in the quest to find meaning and purpose when living with a disability. It is...the autonomy of humanity over against God that accounts for oneof the most remarkable features of the Hebrew Bible, the possibility thatpeople can argue with God and win. (Levenson, 1988) The angriest character in the Old Testament is God. The anger of God was expressed as a partner in a covenantal relationship and directed at those who turned away from God. It was an anger born of love and justice for the people of God. This is the difference between Correspondence concerning this article should be addressed to: The Rev. Nancy 1. Lane, Ph.D, 479 South A' enue, Elmira, NY 14904.2250. BESTCOPY AVAILABLE153 98 Nancy J. Lane anger that is good andanger that is deadly. The first is connected withseeking justice, the second with punishmentof others and ofourselves. Anger is the antithesisof inertia and it isan aliveness. Itgoes through the body likea jet of freezingwater; it fills the veins withpurpose; it alerts the lazyeye and ear; the torpidlungs grow rich with easy breath.(Gordon, 1993,p. 3) It is our abilityto experienceanger which allows usto experience love,joy, and deep caring for life. Angeris the energy whichpromotes justice and pushesus toward growth. Anger is a fact of life,woven into the fabric of daily living. It can behealthy and life- changing, or itcan be destructive anddeath-making. Anger denied, unresolved cancause toour health and well-being.This kind ofanger changes nothing andcauses love to lose allpower (Campbell, 1986). The anger ofpeople with disabilitiesis rarely understoodor accepted as validor necessary. Our anger isignored, denied,or silenced by those whotell us howwe should feel and behave.This is one of themany ways which othersuse power over us. Failure to behave accordingto standards determinedby others isone more way of labelingand in dis-empowerus people angryis death-makingto our souls. Labelingus for our angerserves to isolate us and further deny thefullness of our humanity,leaving us frustrated...andangry. This may cause us to be locked intoa vicious cycle that leadsto destructive behaviors,depression and hopelessness.All of this, inturn, makes us even lessacceptable to the worldof non- disabled people.When the anger ofpeople disabilitiesis denied, prevented from beingpart of a community.Anger is a protestagainst being treatedas less than equal. Anger expressed is away of asking to be takenseriously. Anger heardis being takenseriously. Anger is a choicewe make when faced withthe struggles of living.It is a chosen reaction to humiliation (Rohrer& Sutherland, 1981).For people livingwith a disability,it may be the only appropriatechoice in the face ofnegative attitudes andthe barriers ofdiscrimi- nation. However,anger may also be away of manipulating life,a learned pattern of behavior used toavoid further loss andpain. How weuse the power ofanger is also a matter of choice and responsibility(Campbell. 1981). It is notnecessary, nor is it alwaysa good thing, to \"ventanger\" every timewe experience it. Therehas to be a balance,which we find byplacing ouranger within the context of whowe are, Our moral valuesand the choiceswe prefer. Expressinganger every time we feelthreatened or frustratedmay not be who weare or how we behave inthe world. BEST COPY AVAILABLE154 A Theology of Anger When Living with Disability 99 This is not the same as denying or repressing anger, however. The denial of anger can causephysical and emotional health problems, and the fear of being angry can make thesedestructive consequencesworse. However, expressing that one feels angry is not the same as giving anger free reign to trample on our relationships.Learning to understand ouranger helps us to control our behavior and make responsiblechoices in how we behave toward ourselves and others. It also helps us to see that howothers respond to our anger is their problem and they must deal with their feelings. The exception to this is when ouranger is abusive and destructive. We have a responsibilityto \"be angry but sin not\" (Ephesians 4:26).In order to examine the role of anger in the lives of people with disabilities, we will firstreview the psychology ofanger in relationship to psychological and spiritual growth.Next, we will discuss the Biblical paradigms for expressing anger to God and why doingSOis necessary if one is to have a relationship with God.The Meaning of AngerWhenever we are prevented from achieving our goals and desires, we are frustrated andhave a need to change the situation. The emotional response to frustration is anger. There is \"a distinction between feelings of anger and the emotion of anger\" (Campbell, 19S6, p. 25). A response to a threat or to frustration causes bodily change, thus we \"feel angry.\" The\"emotion of anger is a state of mind of a more complex nature in which we have associatedthose feelings with various perceptions, thoughts and...fantasies\" (Campbell, 19S6, p. 25).Anger as an emotion is expressed in a variety of ways: teasing, practical jokes, sarcasm.prejudice, gossip, domination, suicide, rape, tickling, arguing, shooting, killing, anddestroying. Anger as an element of passive behavior is expressed in: depression, guilt. withdrawal, the \"super-sweet\" personality, pouting, silence, and moodiness (Rohrer & Sutherland, 1981).Anger can be destructive if we do not understand our emotions and feelings as peopleliving with disabilities. \"Accepting\" one's disability is not the same as \"liking\" it. I haveno choice in accepting or not accepting my disability. I do have a choice in liking ordisliking the disability itself. Note that I am referring to liking or disliking \"the disability\" and not my person. Destructive anger occurs whenever we feel the following: we feelpowerless over other people and circumstances; we do not feel self-sufficient; we have a diminished feeling of importance; or we feel frustrated in the face of what cannot beachieved (Rohrer .1 Sutherland, 1981).Sources of Anger1) Anger is a component of the grief cycle, experienced whenever there is loss. Disability creates loss, usually for a life-time. 2) In addition to our actual limitations, BEST COPY.AVAILABLE155 100Nancy J. Lane society imposesadditional limitationson us through thelack of equalaccess to (e.g. worship).3) If we feelwe substituteanger for feelings of weakness. 4) Whenwe fear our own desiresand needs,we retreat intoanger as a way of restoring asense of self-sufficiency(Rohrer & Sutherland,1981).

Eachtime we comeup against an occasionwhich reminds us ofa loss, we experience theloss again. Anger in times ofoverwhelming griefcan cause many physicalreactions, leavingus BEST COPY AVAILABLE157 102Nancy J. Lane with an evergreater sense of helplessnessand loss of control(Campbell, 1986). If we endure the pain ofa severe loss, we mayenter a chronicallydepressed state in which we withdraw in orderto protect ourselves fromfurther loss. As theyears pass, the loss will create a powerfulscreen of defensiveness(Campbell, 1986).We will need torecover our anger in order to heal andlive again with feelingand hope. We can groupmany of the losses we feel into four categories. 1. Power:power is a means of being free to make ourown choices. It is the opposite of feeling weakor powerless. Powercomes from how wesee ourselves. However,persons dis-empoweredby servicesystems and politicalstructures which deny themaccess to economic and medical opportunities. Anger isoften necessary to maintain our freedomand autonomy. Our lossis felt in thefrustration of being dis- empowered and deniedthe benefits others takefor granted. Forexample, The demeaning andincreasingly fruitlessnature of the application and renewal process forSocial Security and otherentitlements can beone of the by[persons with disabili- ties].... So [we] find[ourselves] doubly frustrated and angry both at the system itself and otherswho refuse to understand[what we areput through]. (Thompson,1985, p. 84) Helplessness remindsone of one's powerlessness. Anger can be a screen to hide feelings of helplessness.Anger can also bean appropriate reaction toour inability to defend ourselves from theviolations of abuse andexploitation. Both of thesepoint to an on-going loss forpeople with disabilities.Being treatedas a child is a familiar experience for people with disabilities.Others make decisionsfor you regardless of your wishesand desires, thereby dis- respecting your need for autonomy and your independenceas a person. This loss ofindependence andautonomy is another frustration of goals anddesires.2. Self-sufficiency:many people assume that people with disabilitiesare inadequate or unable to do many tasksor jobs. This is yet another loss, a frustration of hopes anddesires. The appropriateresponse is anger which willeducate others and seekchange. It means being assertive anddemanding one's equalrights. 3. Wanting to beimportant: the lesssecure we are about ourselves, the more we need to be important to others.If our importance isthreatened, we becomeangry. A secure sense of self is madedifficult when thereare so many losses. Untilwe know that weare accepted by another, lovedby another, and heardby anotherwe willcontinue to beangry. Our importancecomes understood.4. Loss ofself-esteem: low self-esteemoriginates in our beingignored and not being158 A Theology of Anger When Living with Disability 103 heard. It is often assumedthat people with disabilities do not have the same feelingsas others, or that somehowour feelings are of less importance. \"Loss of self-esteemcomes when our feelingsare not important enough to be heard\" (Rohrer & Sutherland, 1981, p. 69). When our feelingsare dismissed or we are toldwe should not feel whatwe feel, who we are is denied. The real work of healing lies in others'listening to our stories,feelings, desires and fears. Untilour feelings are acknowledged, we have not been acknowledged as persons.Many of us becomeangry when we are not heard. All too often we are told notto express our anger because non-disabled people simply cannot handleit (Thompson, 1985).It is alright for people to beangry about every issue fromgay rights to the environment; but it is not alright to beangry because others refuse to hear us or refuse to accept thatmany of our problems resultfrom barriers others continueto erect (Thompson, 1985). Each loss preventsone from having a sense ofautonomy or power over her/his own life. Anger is the attemptto retrieve choice, freedom,autonomy, equality, andrespect for our adulthood. The problem lies in how we use theanger associated with these losses and how we become empowered.Anger and DepressionAnger is also aresponse to the losses we experience and is part of the on-goinggrief cycle in people withdisabilities. Some depressions are reactions to crisis in which there has been a failure toexpress anger. If you cannotexpress anger, you cannotmove through it, nor can youmove through the grief cycle. You remain stuck in a cycle ofloss, frustration and depression. Excessiveor prolonged grief leads to depression, \"an unhealthy condition that has gone beyond thebounds of normal mood changes and situational reactions\"(Berg. & McCartney, 1981,p. 3). We feel so hopeless, lonely, deprived or frustrated thatwe seek to escape the pain by withdrawing inside ourselves. Freud saw depressionas anger turned inward, \"creating guilt, depression and theurge to self-destruction\"(Campbell, 1986, p. 55).However, this is not thecase with the universal experiences ofloss and vulnerability.\"...anger and depressionare not mirror images of one another.Depression is not simply...anger turned inward\" (Martin, 1986, p. 32). Both anger and depression may be learned coping strategies [cf. Seligman's work on learned helplessness). Learned patterns of behavior maygo back to childhood when something needed was not provided. The scars of deprivationcause us to defend ourselves against the fear of abandonment. Anger, anxiety and depression are closely connected and feed one another. Angermay not even be a possibility here as there is an establishedpattern of guilt and withdrawal(Campbell, 1986). We withdraw from danger by blamingself. Guilt and self-blameare often the result of loss. This creates a vicious cycle of seeing ourselves as worthless and erodes our self-image. One gets sucked into a black hole of helplessness and meaninglessness.Even if we learn howto use anger creatively to address issues of injustice andto bring BEST COPY AVAILABLE159 104 Nancy J. Lane about change, we can experience depression from burnout. There is a \"disability fatigue.\"an inescapable burden which comes from living with a disability and needing to fight forequal opportunity,explain, demand rights, and never having a rest from theeffects of the disability itself. This fatigue can cause us to become very frustrated; whenthere is no outlet for the frustration, the fatigue settles in on us like a heavy weight,exacerbating our sense of helplessness. Frustration can cause one to give up hope or turnto violence (McClosky, 1986).Suffering is one more of the frustrations we do not know what to do with. The root causeof most anger at God has to do with our trying to find meaning in the problem of suffering.If we are to find meaning in our frustrations and anger, we need to come before God andwith glaring honesty name the anger about our suffering and disability. Until we put thepain of our anger before God, it cannot be healed. Repressing anger in a relationship causesthe relationship to die. We cannot be present to God without being honest about ourfeelings. If our anger is repressed from God, then God cannot know us in the fullness ofour being. In order to understand the significance of expressing one's anger to God, we wil Iexamine the meaning of a covenantal relationship with God.Discussing anger within a relationship with God raises questions about God's anger.However, it is not the purpose or intent of this paper to discuss God's anger, which isappropriately a question of Biblical hermeneutics. The Old Testament has many examplesof God's anger at the people of God. My personal understanding of this issue is that whenwe turn away from God through negligence, disobedience or sin, God is angry, but increative ways which are meant to call us back to God (especially found in the Psalms).Moltmann (The Crucified God, 1974, p. 272) says the wrath of God is injured love, whichis not inflicted, but is a divine suffering of evil. However, the wrath of God, as seen in theOld Testament, is a current topic of debate among many feminist theologians who see itas a form of patriarchal abuse. I suspect the theology of a wrathful God will have to be de-constructed before it can be reconstructed into an understanding which will be helpful. Anger at GodPart of our faith journey and the healing of our anger lies in our ability to question God.What God do we worship if we are afraid to challenge God with our questions of why? Dowe follow a God born of our own fear or a God of love who leads us from self-hatred intoacceptance? One's relationship with God may be broken out of fear of expressing anger.Yelling at God will help re-establish the relationship. It may be that we only pray whenshaking our fist at God.The establishment of both the Old and the New Covenant created a relationship betweenGod and the people of God.I A covenant formulates a dialectical theology in which therecan be a dialogue of .questions and answers. One can both argue with God and vet obeyGod. Both are spiritual acts; discovering when each is appropriate in the life of faithrequires discernment. 160 A Theology of Anger WhenLiving with Disability 105 The point of thisis to show that whenwe have a relationship withGod, dialogue is expected and warranted.At the same time,we can acknowledge that theway:C: :.' are a mystery; Our the silenceinthe mysteryorin discerning what it isthat is being asked ofus. Answers require questions, and many ofour questions are rootedin the anger ofour limited understanding.The same devastating questions whichwe ask of each othermust be asked of God. Atthe same time, toquestion is to affirm.Suffering is a radicalchallenge to the meaningof human existence.The problemof suffering raises thequestions about good andevil, and thesource of evil. Much ofour an zer at God may come inthe form of asking hardquestions, for which theremay be no answers. Most of the questionshave to be asked inorder for us to struggletoward theanswer which will be differentfor each of us. We findGod in our questioning,not in ready-made answers from those whoknow nothing ofsuffering. We discoverGod in seekingto question the meaningof life, the meaningof suffering, andthe meaning of evil. Questioning is costly:it can be as painfulas the suffering itself.Paradigms of ExpressingAnger at GodJob seemed with covenantas described above. Hesays: \"But I would speakto Idesire case against God\" (Job13:3). Job's anger at out of his internalconflict with God, thus\"Job feels freeto call upon God for an advocateagainst God\" Godwho gives and whotakes the believeris irresistibly pushed again and againtoward God\" (Garrison,1982, p. 169). Job angrily challengedGod to explain thecause of his suffering. He didnot really expect an answer, nor did heget one. \"The God whoresponds to Job witha magnificent description of hispower and creativity and who angrily rebukes hiscomforters for their lack of understanding,is a God whom Jobcan continue to obey\"(Campbell, 19S6,p. 86). This is a God ofcreation and order,not chaos and destruction.God's angercan be seen as a love with creativepurposes. In challenging God, Job came faceto face with God and entered into God'smystery, in which wesee that there are noanswers for now. Yet, like Job, we cango on in faith, trusting thatthe God of Love willnever abandon us. There is great liberationin expressinganger at God becausewe are acknowledging the reality and the depthsof pain and suffering.The book of Joband many of thePsalms express this realisticanger. \"If anger is the otherside of love, then itmust at times bea feature of a livingfaith...\" (Campbell,1986, p. 49). Weare not offending God butwe are expressing oursense of betrayal from the One whom we trustedas loving us. Campbell (1986, p. 77)says that \"...suchanger is best understoodas the cry of someone whowill not despair of God....\"We come faceto face with the darkside of God,yet continue to trust in God'smercy by virtue of our crying out.

BEST COPY AVAILABLE162 A Theology of Anger When Living with Disability 107 Forgiving GodWe have said that expressing anger at God is part of being in relationship with God. One cannot be in a relationship where there is no forgiveness. Further, it is not a covenantal relationship if forgiveness is offered by only one partner.In the play). B. by Archibald MacLeish, Job's response is to forgive God for not making a better world. It is a response born of love, which is a gift. Man depends on God for all things, God depends on man for one. Without man's love, God does not exist as God, only as creator, and love is the one thing no one, noteven God..., can command. It is a free gift or it is nothing. And it is more itself, most free, when it is offered in spite ofsuffering, of injustice, and of death (MacLeish,\"God has need of Man\" in Glatzer, 1969, p. 285). Glatzer considers this to bea humanist rendering of what was originally conceived to be an issue of faith. I note this only to show that I am aware of the criticism. However, I believe the points made about covenantal and dialectical theology pointto a relationship with God. Relationships require that we either are indifferentor we love the other. Anger arises because wecare deeply, we love. I therefore see love as the reason and the source of our ability to forgive God.Rabbi Kushner carries MacLeish a bit further when he speaks about forgiving God: Are you capable of forgiving and loving God even when you have found out that [God] is not perfect, even when [God] has let you down and disappointed you by permitting bad luck and sickness and cruelty in [God's] world, and,permitting some of those things to happen to you? Canyou learn to love and forgive [God] despite [God's] limitations, as Job does, and as you once learned to forgive and love your parents even though they were not wise,as strong, as perfect as you needed them to be?And if you can do these things, will you be able to recognize that ability to forgive and the ability to love are the weapons God has given to us to en'ible us to live fully, bravely, and meaningfully in this less-than-perfect world? (Kushner, 1981,p. 148). To talk about forgiving Godmay seem to imply blame. God's reply to Job makes it clear BEST COPYAVAILABLE163 108Nancy J. Lane that theways BEST COPY AVAILABLE16 4 A Theology ofAnger When Living with Disability 109 suffering. It also comes with things which give us happiness and meaning. We come to understand that God suffers with us and know that we are not abandoned. We know Godforgives those who have brought pain and destruction into our lives. We accept that the love of God forgivesus for the pain and destruction we cause others or ourselves.Anger as a Creative PowerBeverly Harrison (1981,p. 50) writes that \"Anger directly expressed is a mode of takingthe other seriously.\" Too often it is we who are not taken seriously, so it is difficult for our anger to be heard and understood as necessary for our inclusion. It is imperative for us to find creative and meaningfulways of dealing with the threats and frustrations of livingwith a disability. Ouranger must become a constructive tool for communicating clearlyand truthfully what we need and what we feel.\"The gospel of anger\" can be found in the anger of Jesus, who sided with the rejectedof society and who spoke out fearlessly against the authorities. Jesus had no patience withthose whose piety overlooked justice and mercy. His anger was to speak truth to falseh ..Npdand hypocrisy. The gospel of anger is about truth, love and justice (Campbell, 1986). Thisis anger which identifies and articulates clearly what is needed. It speaks out of love and seeks to bring change where it is needed.Much of the injustice we face is created and sustained by political structures. It is difficult to address an entire system in an effort to create change and effect justice. Personalcommunication usually has no effect, and political communication by persons with disabilities has brought too little too late for too few. We can use our anger in positive ways to insist upon change by seeking love and not destruction. This is the hard path as it makes no concessions to injustice and requires a spiritual discipline which will keep us from becoming the oppressor.When anger is because of oppression and social injustice, we usually feel alienated fromothers. However, failure to express our anger at the injustices which threaten the qualityof our lives results in apathy and diminishment of who we are (Campbell, 19S6). Peopletend to feel angry and guilty when the oppressed \"spill their guts.\" It requires courage andboldness to confront with honesty and clarity the injustices which undermineour lives. This is another place where expressing our anger to God can protect us from apathy.Once we come to understand our anger and move through it, we can begin to synthesizeit with other aspects of who we are: 1) We may combine it with intelligence and reasoningso that we develop a sharp mind. 2) Anger may motivate our ambition and we will achieveour goals. 3) Anger may stir us to work for justice where there is injustice. 4) Anger may drive us to work tirelessly on behalf of others who suffer (Rohrer & Sutherland, 1981). 5) We can turn anger into compassion through support groups which break down our sense of isolation (McCloskey, 1986). 165-BEST COPY.AVAILABLE 1110 Nancy J.

Ninety-nine percent of doctors believe there is an important relationshipbetween the spirit and the flesh (AP, 6/97). Our workshops on Spirituality and Healing and Explorationsin the Healing of Addictions explore the relationship between our spiritual health and faith in God and ourphysical and psychological well-being. This holistic approach reflects Jesus' ministry of healing, which wasalways concerned with the whole person and their transformation.The workshop on The Christian Healing Ministry in the Church is designed solely for churches involved ina healing ministry. The other three workshops are concerned with personal healing. Our workshops use psychology (understanding the power of the mind the effects of consciousness andunconsciousness), theology (how we understand God at work in our lives) and spirituality (how we areconnected to God and Self) to understand how healing is meant to transform our lives.The Rev. Nancy Lane received the Ph.D. in Religion and Psychology from the Union Institute, Cincinnati,Ohio, and was a Visiting Scholar at Oxford University, England, where she studied the meaning of sufferingand healing. Dr. Lane received a B.A. in Religion from Wells College and the Master of Divinity from BexleyHall at Colgate Rochester Divinity School. Ordained in the Episcopal Church in 1983, she served as adiocesan staff officer for several years. Dr. Lane is known as a national and international speaker and haslectured at numerous colleges, seminaries and conferences. She is retreat leader and author of a number ofarticles on spirituality and healing.Dr. Lane is trained in Jungian psychotherapy and in Spiritual Direction. She is currently practicing a Ministryof Healing, based on the principles of integrative and holistic healing of bodymind and spirit, using sacredpsychology, prayer therapy, and laying on of hands for those who request it. DESCRIPTION OF WORKSHOP MODULESI. HEALING AND SPIRITUALITYScience has made enormous strides in recent years with the discovery of an indivisible bodymind. Just as themind is not in one place, so the soul is not to be found in any one place; it is now thought to be throughout thebody. The implications of this are that whatever is in the soul is in the bodymind. Understanding how thesethree aspects affect our health, growth and well-being will evolve rapidly in coming years. Scientific studies ofprayer have also demonstrated that prayer and belief have a direct impact on disease processes, health, andthe entire healing process. The results of these studies suggest that the medical model of health care (adisease-based model) will be replaced by a wellness model.173 Jesus was a healer of body, mind, and soul. Jesus saw wholeness as the well-being of the total person:psychological, spiritual, physical. There was no separation of body and soul because Jesus understood themas bound together in a living unity. Jesus understood that whenever our psychological and spiritual life wasout of balance, the body responded in the effort to communicate this to us.The great spiritual teachers have always regarded psychology as significant to spirituality because of its rolein the integration and transformation process. Transformation requires us to enter into a healing process,where and spirituality work together to set us free to become the person God has created us to be. Depthpsychology has taught us that attitudes, perceptions, and behavior are influenced by feelings, which affecthow our faith matures. We cannot respond authentically to a faith commitment without facing and examiningour feelings and knowing how they affect our lives.This seminar examines the healing process within the context of Jesus life, ministry, death and resurrection.We learn what these mean for our own spiritual journey and how the death and resurrection process requireattention to our psychological life including our sexuality, awareness of our embodiment, the role ofdepression and anger in the spiritual journey, coming to know fully who one is and where you have been,where you are, and knowing where God calls you now.The following format of material is designed for a 2 'A day teaching seminar for continuingeducation programs. It is assumed that participants will have a working knowledge ofbiblical studies, theology and some familiarity of the writings in classical spirituality. This isan intensive seminar of lectures, Q & A with discussion, and extensive handouts. Theworkshop can be designed to fit the host's schedule but cannot be shortened in this format.
