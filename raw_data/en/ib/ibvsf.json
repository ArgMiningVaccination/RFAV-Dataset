Title: Elements in lifestyle interventions for weight reduction among adults with overweight or obesity: a mapping review ---------------------------------- Type of publication: Mapping review A systematic mapping review maps out and categorizes existing research on a topic, identifying research gaps that can guide future research ----------------------------------- Doesn't answer everything: No evaluation of effects of inter- ventions. ----------------------------------- Publisher: The Norwegian Institute of Pub- lic Health ----------------------------------- Updated: Last Consultant, Vestfold Hospital , University of Oslo Marte Kvittum Tangen, Chair, Norwegian College of General Practice 10 Executive summary (English) Executive summary (English) Background The proportion of adults with overw eight and obesity is increasing in the Norwegian population . The propotion with obesity is now 23 % for both women and men, accord- ing to the Nord- Tr\u00f8ndelag Health Study 2017 -18. The main strategies to prevent and treat overw eight and obesity in the primary health care services are advice regarding diet and physical activity, and offers of bariatric surg ery within the specialist health care services. The Norwegian Directorate of Health is aware of the need for the treatments available to persons with overweight and obesity in the primary health care services are strengthened. The interventions should be designed to promote changes in diet , physi- cal activity, and psychological councelling including motivation to carry through life- style changes and manage health challenges. Even though the primary health care can give weight reducing medication, this is not part of our report. Objective We carried out a systematic mapping review, commissioned by the Norwegian Direc- torate of Health. Our aim was to describe available research about interventions (mini- mum one -year duration) to reduce weight given to adults wi th overw eight or obesity , published 2010 or later . Method We searched systematically for literature in the two largest and most relevant elec- tronic databases (Medline and PsychINFO) . One author screened all titles and abstracts, and three other authors independently screened about a third each. They then assessed full text publications against inclusion - and ex clusion criteria in the same manner. One author extracted data and the three other authors verified the data extraction , about a third each . We did not assess the methodological quality of the included studies. We present the studies in tables with information on who performed the study, which pro- fessions that took part, and setting, a description of th e participants, the duration and outcomes of the interventions, in addition to the content of the interventions. The con- tent comprise s the elements that were part of the studies of change in diet, increased physical activity and psychological counselling t o change behaviour and increase moti- vation to change habits . 11 Executive summary (English) Results From the 17 ,533 references identified by the search, w e included 218 full text publica- tions reporting 165 studies. Half of the stud ies had less than 200 parti cipants . The par- ticipants had overweight or obes ity and most of them had no obesity -related or other disease s. Twelve per cent of the studies reported that they included adults with pre- di- abetes or diabetes type 2. Half of the studies measured outcomes at the end o f the in- tervention (52%), 36% of the studies at one to two years after the intervention and 12% of the studies more than two years after the intervention . We categorized the interventions , based on the authors' descriptions, as follows : inter- ventions to change level of physical activity only; interventions to change level of physi- cal activity and psychological counselling; interventions of change of physical activity and change of diet; interventions to change diet only; interventions to change diet and psychological counselling; interventions to change diet , level of physical activity and psychological counselling; psychological counselling only. Approximately half of the studies (46%) comprised interventions to change diet and level of physical acti vity, and psychological counselling. In 17 % of the studies only one of those mentioned above were included. In 49 % of the studies that reported which professions took part, n utritionists in combi- nation with other professions, e.g. physicians, nurses, psychologists, and physiothera- pists, gave the intervention. In 22 % of the studies a nutritionist was the only profession mentioned. Even though we know that several professions took part in the study, we do not know how the work was organised. Calorie restri ction was the most common intervention (137/165 studies). Calorie re- striction was often combined with i) advice on food items (50%), ii) a specific propor- tion of protein, fat and carbohydrates (25%), iii) calorie restriction only (25%). Interventions for increasing physical activities were part of 124 studies, 2/3 of these were training without guidance, 1/3 were with guidance. A combination of changing of diet and increased physical activity, with or without psy- chological counselling, w as studied in 115 studies. Advice on calorie restriction in com- bination with advi ce on food items toghether with advice on unorganised physical ac- tivity, was part of 47 of these studies. Discussion The studies identified present a wide array of potential interventions to reduce weight among adults with overweight and obesity. This is an area with extensive research, Howver, because of the very broad question in this review, we had to limit the search es and this led to us losing relevant literature. Even so , this review underscores the vari- ety, volume and complexity of this field of research as per today. This report shows that there are several ways of combining lifestyle interventions , and that the elements that are part of the interventions are many and c an be combined in many ways. This presen- tation of the elements are useful to show the necessity of being pre cise when defining 12 Executive summary (English) the research question. This is an important challenge for the future research of over- weight and obesity. Needs for further research The research question for this review comprised use of weight -reducing medicines and studies from primary care settings. Our search for literature has not identified these studies in an adequate way. Each of these topic s should be addresse d with narrower and more precise search terms in new systematic reviews. We have not identified literature on overweight and obesity related diseases ade- quately. The various overweight and obesity related diseases should also be addressed in separate rev iews. Several of the studies have different phases . There should be a separate project ad- dressing these phases, to identify the importance of the duration of the various phases. While working on this mapping review we have not had the opportunity to se e the in- terventions in relation to factors that may influence how change in diet and physical ac-tivity can be maintained after the intervention (i.e. adherence). It seems necessary to view these two elements together. Conclusion We found that lifestyle interventions in the 165 studies identified consists of a large nuber of different elements and that there was a large variety in how these elements were combined. Future studies on this topic will need to define the elements precisely. 13 Forord Forord Helse kvalitet og Norge (6). takene overvektsbehandling i pri m\u00e6r helse har arbeidet med tilsvarende problemstillinger.

Beskrivelse av JR, Anders- sen SA, Kvalheim OM. 2013 Three intermittent in- patient periods, from baseline to 6 weeks, from week 23 to 23, from week 50 to 52. Three main components: diet, PA and cognitive behaviour therapy. Both theoretical and practical session were incorporated. The main goal regarding diet was to introduce a healthy diet and eating pattern to provide each subject with tools to improve their diet quality. Each subject followed a high- fibre, low-fat, reduced- energy meal plan based on the Nordic Nutrition Rec- ommendations that inc luded three main meals and two to three snacks each day, and group lessons were taught on how to prepare healthy meals. As such, no specific diet or severely energy -restriction was ap- plied. Subjects participated in a supervised and structured exercise programme consisting of 20- 30 min brisk walking before breakfast and two 45- 60 min exercise sessions (e.g. swimming, aerobics, ball games, hiking or strength training) performed individ- ually or in groups 5 days per week at the RCHRC. No specific target re- gardi ng intensity was specified In addition subject were encourage to perform PA on their own. Together with a team member, each subject developed a plan for PA to be per- formed at home. The subjects were not offered any systematic follow -up at home, but could c ontact the RCHRC or their general practitioner if required. Three main compo- nents: diet, PA and cognitive behaviour therapy. - 141 Abed HS, Wittert GA, Leong DP, Shirazi MG, Bahrami B, Middeldorp ME, et al. 2013 Two phases, weight loss and weight maintenance. Control group got written and verbal nutrition and exercise advice at enrollment. Fish oil (3 g/d) was prescribed except participants taking dual an- tiplatelet agents or oral anticoagulants. Weight loss was induced over 8 weeks using a modified very -low- calorie diet (800- 1200 kcal/d). Pa- tients were prescribed very -low-calo- rie meal replacements sachets for 2 of their daily meals. The third meal consisted of calorie- controlled foods with high levels of animal and plan proteins and low glycemic index. A written exercise plan prescribed low-intensity exercise (walking or cy- cling), initially for 20 minutes 3 times weekly and then increasing to 45 min 3 times weekly. Very low -calorie meals were gradually phased out and replaced with low -glycemic in- dex meals, exercise intensity up ti- tration, and behavioral modification for the following 13 months. Goal -directed face- to-face clinic visits were scheduled every 3 months. Par- ticipants scheduled additional visits as required and were provided 24- hour e- mail and telephone support. - Akers JD, Cornett RA, Savla JS, Davy KP, Davy BM. 2012 12 month single blinded weight loss maintenance intervention fol- lowing completion of a 12 week randomized controlled weigh loss intervention trial. During the program, participants were instructed to record their body weight, daily physical activity assessed by pe- dometer step count and fruit/vegetable intake using the self -moni- toring tracking sheets. In addition intervention group was instructed to record daily water consumption 1200- 1500 kcal hypocaloric diet + 16 fl oz water prior to each daily main meal or 1200- 1500 kcal hy- pocaloric diet alone. Program goals were more than five fruit and vegeta- ble servings per day Program goal more than 10,000 steps per day - - Aller EE, Larsen TM, Claus H, Lindroos AK, Kafatos A, Pfeiffer A, et al. 2014 DIOGENES trial: Subjects were randimiz3e into five diet groups: (1) low protein, LGI (LP/LGI); (2) LP, high GI (LP/HPI); (3) high protein, LGI (HP/LGI) (4) H\u00c5, HGI; (5) a diet according to national healthy eating recommendations. All diets were low in fat (25- 30% of energy from fat) and no energy restriction was im- posed. - - - 142 Aller EE, van Baak MA. 2016 The CO -EUR commercial obesity treatment program consisted of an 18- month multidisc iplinary programme targeting lifestyle modifi- cation. The programme included a physical activity programme, psychological counselling based on cognitive behavioural therapy and nutritional advice to promote a healthy lifestyle. Group meeting once a week initially with individual meetings every 2- 4 weeks, depending on individual needs. The physical activity consisted of one group sport session (Nordic walking, swimming or medical train- ing therapy) per week and the sub- ject were encouraged to implement two addition exercise sessions in their weekly routine. The psychological and nutritional group meetings were scheduled once a week initially, with in- dividual meetings every 2 -4 weeks, de- pending on individual needs. - Anderson AS, Craigie AM, Caswell S, Treweek S, Stead M, Macleod M, et al. 2014 Either the diet and physical activity intervention (BeWEL) or usual care. The 12 month BeWEL programme was delivered in three, one hour, one to one visits during the first three months (including spouse or friend when possible), followed by nine, monthly, 15 min telephone consultation. Thus each participant ha a total of 5,25 hours contact over a 12 month period. - - Motivational inter- viewing techniques were utilized to ex- plore self -assessed confidence, ambiva- lence, and personal values concerning weight change. - Annesi JJ. 2019 Group 1, participants review 12 topics over 28 weeks derived from weight management manuals used in previous research and appli- cations. Every two weeks, a wellness leader lead a conference phone call of 15- 20 minutes that encouraged questions, comments, and practical aspects of the assigned content. The primary focus of the treatment for Group 1 was education related to the weight loss process. In Group 2, participants were administered six sessions (45 min/session) of one- on-one exercise support over 28 weeks that emphasized behavioral goal setting and contracting, setting Beginning at Week 10, 24 str uctured nutrition change sessions (60 min/session) were administered in groups of 8- 15 participants every two weeks In Group 2, participants were admin- istered six sessions (45 min/session) of one- on-one exercise support over 28 week emphasized behav- ioral g oal setting and contracting, setting graded tasks, self - monitoring of behav- iors, performance feedback, barrier identification, identifi- cation of - 143 graded tasks, self -monitoring of behaviors, performance feedback, barrier identification, identification of prompts/cues , self -talk(cogni- tive restructuring, relapse prevention, stress management, and time management. After the initial eight weeks of structured, cognitive- behaviorally based exercise support, food/calorie tracking was added. Beginning at Week 10, 24 structured nutrition change ses- sions (60 min/session) were administered in groups of 8- 15 partici- pants every two weeks. In group 3, participants were administered with the same treatment methods as Group 2, with the addition of five conference phone calls (with the instructor and three to four participants on the call), each spaced by eight weeks. These 15- 20 min calls that reinforced learned self -regulation skills were held af- ter the group nutrition change sessions concluded at week 58. prompts/cues, self - talk(cognitive re- structuring, relapse prevention, stress management, and time management Anton SD, LeBlanc E, Allen HR, Karabetian C, Sacks F, Bray G, et al. 2012 The POUNDS LOST intervention involved a combination of regu- larly scheduled group and individual sessions with the goal of providing all participants with similar educational exposur e to nutri- tion and behavioral self -management skills for weight loss. Follow- ing randomization to one of the four diets, each participant met indi- vidually with an interventionist (registered dietician). At each subse- quent individual session, which occurred every 8 weeks following the start of the group- based intervention, counselors utilized the CTS to review adherence reports with the participants. Additionally, counselors were able to access the CTS in between sessions to re- view adherence levels to each of their assigned participants, as well as provide feedback regarding overall adherence or observed changes in adherence Following randomization to one of the four diets, each participant met individually with an interventionist (registered dietician). - Additionally, counse- lors were able to ac- cess the CTS in be- tween sessions to re- view adherence lev- els to each of their assigned partici- pants, as well as pro- vide feedback re- garding overall ad- herence or observed changes in adher- ence - 144 Appel LJ, Clark JM, Yeh HC, Wang NY, Coughlin JW, Daumit G, et al. 2011 Behavioral weight loss, without in -person contact, but by means of the telephone, the internet and e- mail.

The basis was a behavioral lifestyle modification program that provided group- based counseling and healthy recommendation to improve physical activity in all groups, diet quality in the Mainte- nance group, and diet quality and body weight in the weight loss group, to reduce caloric intake by 500 kcal/d.. Increasing consumption of low -en- ergy dense fruits, vegetables, lean protein, and whole grains The recommendations included 90- 150 min/wk of moderate to vigorous cardio- aerobic exercise such as walking. Participants also received a written program to guide participa- tion in two sessions/week of re- sistance training using resistance bands focused on major muscle groups of the extremities. All groups received behavioral group counseling weekly for the first 24 weeks, then every 2 weeks for the re- mainder of the 12- month intervention. Each session took place in our research facility lasted 60 minutes and included 30 minutes of group - 145 discussion related to a dietary, exercise, or behavioral topic, followed by 30 min of supervised exercise using resistance band exercises. Ard JD, Lewis KH, Rothberg A, Auriemma A, Coburn SL, Cohen SS, et al. 2019 Participants randomized to OPTIFAST program (OP) were provided all MR (meal replacement) at no cost. The FB program during ac- tive weight loss (0- 26 weeks) Participants with BMI < 45 were in- structed to use five MRs per day (800 kcal total) with 40% of calorie as protein, 40% as carbohydrate and 20% as fat. Participants with BI of 45- 49,9 six MRs and hose with BMI over 50 received six MRs plus one meal daily of lean protein and one non- starchy vegetable serving. Participants followed their prescrip- tion for 12- 16 weeks based on pro- vider discretion and patient prefer- ence, after which there was gradual reintroduction of food through week 26. After week 26, participants' calo- ries were gradually increased to achieve weight stability. FB participants were prescribed a calorie -restricted diet emphasizing Both groups received prescriptions for physical activity that included a graduated target of 150 to 180 min /wk of moderate to vigorous exer- cise. Both treatment groups had weekly 45- to 60- minute group behavioral sessions for the du- ration of the interven- tion. Group sessions were facilitated by trained profession in- terventionists using a standardized inter- vention manual.

The three study arms received the same behaviorally based WL intervention in three 6- months phases: in- tensive (months 1- 6), transition (months 7- 12) and maintenance (months 13- 18) During the intensive phase, participants met at the YMCA for 3 group sessions and 1 individual session per month (all 60 min). Group sessions tapered off to 3 and then 1 per month for the subsequent phases, with individual sessions scheduled as needed. 20-25 % protein, 25- 30% fat, and 45-55% et al. 2014 The PA+WL arm involved a PA intervention in conjunction with a di- etary WL intervention. During the maintenance phase, frequency of contact was reduced (one group session of 90 minutes and one tel- ephone contact per month), or group discussion focused on PA goals, specific plans of action to be implemented, and the reinforce- ment of self -regulatory skills. The active control arm met in groups, weekly for the first eight weeks, monthly through the sixth month, and bimonthly until the end of the study (18 sessions total). Ses- sions included health topics relevant to older adults such as how the body changes with ageing, prevention or delaying disease, eat- ing for good health, positive attitudes toward aging, family relation- ships and care giving, and talking to health care providers. The WL goal was a reduction in body mass of approximately 0,3 kg per week for the fi rst six months, for a total loss in loss of 7- 10% of initial body mass. During the weight maintenance phase, participants were encouraged to continue WL as long as their BMI was >20 kg/m2. The PA program consisted of a com- bination of daily walking and interac- tive, group- mediated, behavioral fo- cused sessions (48 total sessions over 18 months), with the primary goal of gradually increasing home - based, moderate intense activity to >|50 minutes/week. The PA inter- vention was divided into two phases: an intensive phase (first six months) and maintenance phase (6- 18 months). During the intensive phase, Individual sessions in the PA group in- cluded one- on-one interactions with staff based on the unique needs of the partici- pant (including re- view of behavioral tools, execution of techniques or strate- gies for lifestyle change, brainstorm-- 147 participants attended weekly, super- vised behavioral sessions, focused on increasing PA and reducing ca- loric intake. ing or problem solv- ing barriers to change, motivation, or simply to touch base with study staff on overall program progress). Beavers DP, et al. 2014 Both the D and D+E groups received the same dietary intervention. Both the E and D+E groups received the same exercise interven- tion. The dietary plan was based on par- tial meal replacements, including p to two meal -replacement shakes per day with each shake providing 500 mg of calcium. For the third meal, participants followed a weekly menu plan and recipes that were low in fact, and high in vegetables and pro- vided 500- 750 kcals/day. , with 15- 20 % of calories coming from protein <30% from fat, and 45- 60% from carbohydrate.

Burke LE, Styn MA, Sereika SM, Conroy MB, Ye L, Glanz K, et al. 2012 A slightly modified version of PREFER Trial, based on social cogni- tive theory and comprised four main components (2) group ses- sions (2) goal -setting and self -monitoring (3) daily dietary (energy and fat intake) goals (4) weekly exercise goals. The sole difference among the groups was the mode of self -monitoring that they were asked to used. Paper diary group participants were provided with standard paper diaries and a nutritional reference book; they were encouraged to calculated subtotals after each entry. PDA group participants were given a PDA with Dietmate Pro software for self - monitoring diet, which tallied consumed calories and fat grams and compared intake to goals. The PDA+FB group had feedback soft- ware that interacted with the self -monitoring software via a cosom algorithm to provide a daily message regarding intake. 1200- 1800 calories, based on weight and gender, <=25% of total calories could be from fat The weekly physical activity goal was 180 minutes by 6 months and increased by 30 minutes semi -annu- ally. Separate evening in- tervention sessions were held for each treatment group. Meetings were held weekly for Months 1- 4, biweekly for Months 5- 12, monthly for Months 13-18. Only one ses- sion was held during the final 6 months, this focused on weight loss mainte- nance. - Buscemi J, Pugach O, Springfield S, Jang J, The weight loss intervention was conducted in a small group format and met twice weekly (60 min once per week and 90 min once per week) on the university cam pus.

These sessions were conducted face-to-face or over the phone, lasting approximately 20- 30 min. Each MI ses- sion addressed ei- ther diet or physical activity. The goal of the MI sessions was to assist individuals to work through their ambivalence about behavior change within a supportive climate where they felt comfortable ex- pressing both the positive and negative aspects of their cur- rent behaviour. Cai R, Chao J, Li D, Zhang M, Kong L, Participants in the control group received usual care, including a two-hour education session every two months to impart basic health know ledge, such as the dangers of obesity and the benefits Participants met with dietitians who instructed the participants on how to modify their diet to ac hieve their weight loss goals.

The mixed delivery mode including group- based and individual -based interven- tions, was used to support weight loss. The group- based interven- tion provided classroom -style sessions for 2 h every two weeks in the first 12 months and every month from month 13 through month 24 to impart health knowledge by the clinicians in communities. These sessions included not only basic health knowledge, but also specific guidance regarding physical activity and diet.

Call CC, Piers AD, Wyckoff EP, Lowe MR, Forman EM, Butryn ML. 2019 Participants in the parent study were randomized to one of three group- based BWL conditions. Conditions were identical in terms of treatment contact (i.e. 26, 75- min sessions in groups of 10- 15 par- ticipants) but varied in terms of the skills emphasized. One condi- tion was a standard behavioral treatment condition, one condition emphasized making changes to the home food and exercise envi- ronment, and the third condition emphasized changing the home food and exercise environment using an acceptance- based frame- work. The interventions consisted of 6 moths of BWL treatment (4 months of weekly and 2 months of biweekly groups) immediately followed by 6 months of weight loss maintenance treatment (monthly groups).

Campbell PT, Gross MD, Potter JD, Schmitz KH, Duggan C, McTier- nan A, et al. 2010 All women were asked to not change their dietary habits for the duration of the trial. The exercise intervention pro- gressed to more than 45 min/d of moderate- intensity aerobic exercise, 5 d/wk, by the 8th week of the trial, wher e it was maintained to the end of the study. For months 1- 3 the in- tervention participants attended 3 mandatory exercise sessions at a study facility and exercised twice per week at home. For months 4- 12, the intervention group attended at least 1 session per week at a study facility and conducted the remaining ses- sions at home or at a study facility. - - Christensen JR, Over- gaard K, Carneiro IG, Holtermann A, Sogaard K. 2012 Phase 1 (0- 3 months) focused on weight loss and included advice on dietary change based on the Danish Dietary recommendations, calorie counting, weight measurements, weight loss target, strengthening exercises and initiating leisure time fitness exercise. The second part (3- 12 months) focused on weight loss mainte- nance through further intervention with physical exercise and cogni- tive behavioral training. The reference group was offered a monthly two-hour oral presentation during working hours. The twelve presentations were based on the Danish National Board of Health and t he Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Fisheries public websites Reduction of refined sugar, reduc- tion of fat, especially saturated fat, carbohydrates from primarily fiber - rich sources and 600 gram of fruit and vegetables per day.

The dose of the in- structed physical exercises in the sessions progressed in intensity throughout the intervention, by in- creasing weights and repetitions. In addition to the brief training ses- sions, participants were encouraged to initiate leisure time aerobic exer- cises for two hours weekly such as biking, walking, running, swimming or attending different sports in the lo- cal area. From the 6th to the 9th month a simple fitness gym was ar- range with rubber bands, dumbbells, core-balls, skipping ropes and mat- tresses plus fitness machines for ab- dominal and back extension, leg curls and leg press. During the 9th to the 12th month physical exercises primary took place as different local sports ac tivities. It was the aim that all participants should attend sports at least twice a week (minimum of two hours in total), on group discussions and a specifically tai- lored guideline, con- taining exercises such as pro- and-con schemes and posi- tive thinking strate- gies with home- work between each ses- sion. During the first three months, about 15 minutes of the weekly sessions was used on CBT, help- ing the participants to make realistic weight loss targets and find personal strategies to ease hunger. From the 3rd to the 9th month about 30 minutes were spent on CBT in the week ly ses- sions. Focus was to reflect on dysfunc- tional attitudes and coping behaviors with respect to the 155 weight loss, and dis- cuss functional alter- natives and train the implementation of these in everyday life. During the 9th to the 12th month about 15 minutes of each session were spent on how to continue healthy behaviors, cope with social con- text and situations in- volving alcohol, food etc. Cicero AF, Benelli M, Brancaleoni M, Dainelli G, Merlini D, Negri R. 2015 Our method is articulated in different stages, in the first step we pro- vide a protein intake of 1,2- 1,5 g/kg of ideal body weight, in associ- ation with low -glycemic index vegetables. Afterwards the formula- tions are replaced by natural protein foods and the diet is gradually completed with other aliments on the base of glycemic index follow- ing a multiphasic scheme. The enrolled patients have been subjected to a diet based on the use of milk/egg/legumes origin (peas and NO OGM soybeans), 2- 6 g car- bohydrates, 3 g fats for a caloric in- take of 100 kcal. A dditionally, vege- tables were allowed. Firstly patients were exclusively treated with formu- lations and vegetables. Then only one formulation was replaced by a protein aliment (meat, fish, eggs) and vegetables. Immediately after, another formulation was subs tituted - - - 156 with another protein food. Eventu- ally, patients inserted, in sequential, fruit, dairy products, cereals and leg- umes. The last stage consisted in a re-education to the Mediterranean diet based on patient's expenditure of energy. However, from the very beginning an integration of calcium, magnesium, potassium, omega 3 fatty acids and olive oil is necessary. Coles LT, Fletcher EA, Galbraith CE, Clifton PM.2014 Those allocated to the Choice group could choose which of the three study diets they w anted to follow and were able to seek per- mission from the research team to switch between these diets at any time. Those in the No Choice group were placed on the CSIRO diet without any option to change diets. The three diets were South Beach (SB), Mediter ranean (MED) and The CSIRO Total Wellbeing Diet (CSIRO). The CSIRO and MED di- ets provided approximately 6000 kJ/day for both men and women, whilst the SB diet was ad libitum. The diets are described elsewhere.

The focus of the intervention was on increased PA and a moderately restricted balanced diet (500 kcal/day energy deficit from estimated energy needs with 50% energy provided from carbohydrates, 30% from fat, and 20% from protein). Cognitive be- havioral therapy was also used to help to achieve the expected changes in diet and physical activity levels over time. At each stay at the center, participants attended monitored and structured PH with a PA therapist, both individually (one session/day) and i groups (2 sessions/day). During the home stays, participants were advised to be physically active every day (at least 60 min on most, prefera- bly every day) and aim for at least two to three sessions of re- sistance and endurance exercise per week. Moreover , they were advised to follow a similar diet as that used at the center. At the third stay (1- yr follow -up) participants received individual counseling and written advice from a dietician on a dietary intake that would be consistent with their estimated en ergy needs. Participants took also part in a nutri- tion education program and received six meals a day (4 main meals and 2 snacks). At the first stay, exercise focused mainly ((=%) on endurance exercise (walking, spinning, hydro gymnas- tics, and hiking), wit h resistance training being progressively intro- duced, so that the third sty it com- prise approx 50% of the exercise training.

From post -treatment through the end of the study, groups con- tinued to meet bi -weekly, then every three weeks, then monthly un- til the end of the 12 month study. The overriding theme of the pro- gram included a \"non- dieting\" approach with participants making their own choices about the small changes they would make in eat- ing and physical activity over time. Each session covered a s pecific topic related to weight loss. The format allowed for eductional and group discussion. Weekly goals for daily calorie con- sumption and red and green food counts were set at the end of each session. - Cognitive behavioral techniques were used by the lifestyle coaches to promote weight loss and healthy lifestyles. Ac- tive problem solving and implementing coping strategies - 158 was also discussed during sessions.

Participants started the assigned diet on the second inpatient day, and continued it during the whole Stage Two. Stage One included 15 CBT groups (five a week), 18 sessions of aerobic exercises and six sessions callisthenic. Educa- tion addressed energy balance, the food pyramid, size of portions and regular eating, calorie counting, shopping and food labels, physical activity. Stage Two included 12 sessions of 45 min eac h over 48 weeks with a CBT -trained dietitian. The first 4 sessions were carried out every 2 weeks, followed by 4 sessions every 4 weeks and then by 4 sessions every 6 weeks in the last 24 weeks. Every sessions had the following content: weighing the patient, Both diets were energy -restricted (1,200 kcal/day for women and 1,500 kcal/day for men), with 20% energy from fats and daily multivita- min supplements.

Participants were permitted addition in- person sessions, phone, or email con- tacts beyond the 32 expected, if they or the dietician felt these would help achieve intervention goals. Women in the control group were requested not to change their diet or exercise habits for the duration of the trial.

The goal of the NEW exercise inter- vention was >= 45 min of moderate- to-vigorous intensity exercise, 5 day/week (225 minutes /week) for 12 months. Participants attended at least three sessions/week at our study facility where they were super- vised by an exercise physiologist, and exercised for the remain ses- sions at home. The exercise training program began with a 15 minute session at 60- 70% maximal heart rate and progressed to the target 70- 85% maximal heart rate for 45 minutes go the 7th week where it was maintained for the remainder of the study. Facility based exercise consisted of treadmill walking, sta- tionary bicycling, use of other aero-- - 171 bic machines, a variety of home ex- ercises were encouraged including walking, aerobics, bicycling. A small amount of resistance training to strengthen joints and limit injury was recommended, though not required.

The resistance training consisted of 10- 15 repetitions and 2- 3 sets per exercise. Study partici- pants had individual sessions with qualifi ed personnel who used a life- style modification intervention to in- voke behavioural change in the par- ticipants. The MLI treatment day in- cluded one session of supervised physical exercise such as aerobics, treadmill walking, step machines, in- door cycling and resistance training. The intensity was moderate to high. The resistance training was per- formed with 10- 15 repetitions and 2- 3 sets per exercise.

Prescribed kcals/d were adjusted upward 100 kcal/d increments each week when further weight loss was not indicated or when the participant expressed to the inter vention staff that they no longer desired to lose additional weight. Meal plans were provided. Prescribed physical activity pro- gressed to 300 min/wk by the end of week 24, with participants encour- aged to maintain this dose for the re- mainder of the 18 months. Intensity was prescribed as moderate to vigorous. The SBWI received group- based inter- vention sessions throughout the 18- month. Sessions were weekly for months 1- 6, twice per month 7- 12 and once per month dur- ing 13- 18. Sessions focused on improv- ing knowl edge re- lated to adoption and maintenance of eat- ing and activity be- haviors to promote weight loss, strate- gies to facilitate long- term behavioral change such as a barrier identification, problem solving, mastery experiences for self -efficacy.

The use of the product for meal re- placement of obese subjects was recommended two a day within the first six weeks, and once a day in the following week. Led by a sport physiologist, partici- pants engaged in group- based exer- cise sessions once or twice a week. These sessions focused on endur- ance training as well as specific ex- ercise to improve muscle strength, coordination and relaxation. One of the goals of the intervention was to teach participants how to include ex- ercise in their everyday lives. Behavior change was discussed with the psychologist in the group meetings also.

The total fat content is <=30% of the daily energy in- take. The reduction phase should be undertaken until the partici- pant achieves two- thirds of intended weight reduction, at least for 10 weeks. Transitional phas e: the beginning of the transitional phase is determined individually, at least one meal should be re- placed and the other two should be eaten as a fat -reduced mixed meal. Stabilization phase: due to the acquired knowledge on how to arrange their meals corr ectly and how to adjust their energy intake to their daily requirements, the participants should maintain their weight without meal replacements. In this phase, they should eat three meals per day regularly. le Roux CW, Astrup A, Fujioka K, Greenway F, Lau et al.2017 1505 allocated to liraglutide 3,0 mg, 749 allocated to placebo Participants were advised to reduce their daily energy intake to 500 kcal below their individualized energy re- quirement Participants were advised to achieve at least 150 min of physical activity per week All participants re- ceived standardised lifestyle intervention counselling from ran- domisation to end of follow -up, about once a month Liraglutide 3,0 Le T, Flatt SW, Natara- jan L, Pakiz B, Quintana EL, Heath The diets compared were lower fat (20% energy), higher carbohydrate (65%) energy); lower carbohydrate (45% energy) higher fat (35 % en- ergy); and walnut -rich (18% energy), The physical activity goal was an av- erage of at least 60 min/day of pur- poseful exercise at a moderate level of intensity plus increased lifestyle activity.

The amount of high- biological -value proteins ranged be- tween 0,8 and 1,2 g per each kg of ideal body weight, to ensure meeting the minimal body requirements and to prevent the loss of lean mass. Throughout the ketogenic phases supplements of vitamins and miner- als, such as K, Na, Mg, Ca, and omega- 2 fatty acids were provided in accordance to international rec- ommendations. In the re- education stage, the ketogenic phases were ended by the phy sician in charge of the patient based on the amount of weight lost, and started a low -calorie diet. At this point, the patients under- went a progressive incorporation of 204 different food groups and partici- pated in a program of alimentary re- education to guarantee the long- term maintenance of the weight lost.

Duri ng months 7- 12, par- ticipants were asked to attend monthly in- person group sessions and maintain coloric intake goals and exercise behaviors prescribed during the inital treatment phase. Eligible participants were randomly assigned to intake goals of 1,000 or 1,500 kcal/day, respectively. Participants were encouraged to in- crease walking to 10,000 steps per day Treatment included training in cognitive and behavioral skills for weight manage- ment including stimu- lus control, self -rein- forcement, cognitive restructuring, prob- lem solving. Each group session in- volved a private weigh -in, review of participants' pro- gress toward goals, - 205 feedback, and en- couragement from group leaders and other group mem- bers, and a brief presentation related to nutrition, physical activity, stress man- agement, or behav- ioral management of eating and physical activity.

At least one objective for each energy intake (diet/eating behavior) and energy expenditure (exercise) parameter was set for each month. Participants in the control group did not re- ceive any support for one year. Dietitians explained adequate %fat and carbohydrate intake compared with each participant's actual intake as assessed by the diet history questionnaire.

At enrollment partici- pants identified their specific eating challenges. Ten small eating strategies were: prepare the main meal at home, take time for meals, drink water instead of sweetened beverage, eat a fruit or vegetable before snacking, eat breakfast daily, make half the main meal vegetables, turn off the television during meals, stop buying snack foods, hide snacks in an inconvenient place, eat main meals on a 10- inch plate. Strategies to reduce calorie intake Strategies to increase activity After goal setting, participants random- ized to the PA/SA group were taught the positive af- fect/self- affirmation script. They were in- structed to identify small things that made them feel good and asked to think about these things when they first wake up in the morning and throughout their day. For the self -af- firmation component participants were asked to think of a proud moment in their life and to think of that moment when they were faced with barriers to their new behavior goals. - 212 Pjanic, Mul- ler R, Lai- mer M, Ha- genbuch N, Laederach K, Stanga Z. 2017 First part lasted 12 weeks with the first 6 weeks being the most in- tensive treatment phase. During weeks 1 through 6, patients had a weekly 90 minutes session in cognitive behavioral therapy, three 90 min sessions in nutrition counseling, a weekly two hour session in body -awareness therapy, and two 60 min exercise sessions to im- prove physical activity levels. During weeks 7 to 12, patients re- ceived weekly alternating CBT session or nutrition counselling. Also, a weekly 60 min sport session was added. In the second part transfer into everyday life was a central focus. The patients had a monthly session alternatingly between CBT and nutrition counsel- ling. In these sessions, progress and obstacles to their goals were discussed. Additionally, psychological topic s and nutritional advice from the first 12 weeks intensive treatment were repeated. The physical activities had to be organized by the patients themselves as part of the transfer process into everyday life. The nutrition counseling included in- formation on balanced diet, address- ing the combined importance of fat, proteins and carbohydrates, and fo- cusing on a reduction of self im- posed prohibition of certain foods. The physical activity modalities in- cluded water gymnastics, Nordic walking and weight lifting i n the hos- pital's fitness center. The CBT addressed defining realistic weight goals, self - monitoring of dys- functional eating habits, analyzing one's own behavior, setting up flexible be- havioral goals, edu- cation on emotion regulation, and train- ing emotion skills.

The program consisted of 13 individ- ual sessions: 6 face- to-face sessions (baseline and months 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12) with 7 telephone sessions in between. Face- to-face ses- sions were planned to last for 60 min, telephone sessions for 30 min. The counselors traveled to meet participants for face- to-face sessions. We used the Health Action Process Approach. The first three sessions focused on intention building, the four through twelfth session on putting the intentions into action via planning, and the thirteenth session on maintaining the recommended ac- tions. During each counseling session, the participant and the couselor together established dietary and PA goals for the following months. Dietary goals were based on Finnish nutrition recommendations. The main goals were to decrease energy intake by balancing meal frequency and increasing the intake of vegeta- bles, fruits, and berries. The plate model was used for meals: half of the plat consists of vegetables; one fourth of potatoes, rice or paste: one fourth of meat, fish or legumes. The other goals were to use vegetable oils and spreads, consume low fat Increasing habitual walking was the major PA goal. The emphasis was on taking walks in leisure time and during work breaks. The ultimate goal at 12 months was to add 4000 steps on five self -selected days of the week. As 4000 steps corre- sponds to approx 30 min of brisk walking, the additional steps equate to a total of 150 min a week. - - 214 milk and meat products and reduce the use of low -fiber, rapidly -ab- Wing RR. 2012 Lifestyle interventions contain 3 components: a cognitive behavioral intervention, a diet prescription, and a physical activity prescription. The 18- mo intervention consisted of 48 group meetings lasting 60 min each. These meetings occurred weekly from month 1 to month 6 and then twice a m onth from month 7 to month 18. Separate group meetings occurred for the 2 conditions. Sessions covered lessons on behavioral and cognitive skills to help with changing die- tary and physical activity behaviors and were modeled after lessons used in DPP. Participants were instructed to con- sume a standard energy - and fat -re- stricted diet. Daily calorie goals were based on study entry weight. Fat in- take was restricted to 30% of energy from fat. A sample meal plan, based on recommendations of MyPyramid, was provided to help participants consume a balanced diet while meeting energy and fat goals. Par- ticipants were also educated on how to adjust caloric intake for weight maintenance, to prevent weight re- gain. Participants were instructed to grad- ually increase moderat e-intensity physical activity to >=40 min/d 5 times/wk. Participants were encour- aged to walk briskly and accumulate time spent being physically active by engaging in multiple short bouts. Participants were also given a pe- dometer and a goal of 10,000 steps per day. Sessions covered lessons on self -moni- toring, stimulus con- trol, problem -solving, pre-planning, goal setting, re- structuring, interventions: weight loss alone (WL), weight loss + aerobic training (WL+AT), and weight loss + resistance training (WT+RT). The three study arms received the same WL intervention in three 6 - months phases: intensive (months 1- 6), transition (months 7 -12), and maintenance (months 13- 18). During the intensive phase, par- ticipants had three group and one individual session each month. Group sessions tapered off to two and then on per month for the subsequent phases with individual session scheduled as needed. All sessions lasted 60 minutes. The nutritional composition of the diet was 20- 25% proteins, 25- 30% fats and 45- 55 carbohydrates. For the three study arms, no specific physical activity goals were provided except for the AT and RT.

Walking be- havior was shaped toward a goal of 45 min/session with a walking inten- sity of 12 -14 on the RPE Scale. The RT intervention also involved t rain-- - 215 ing 4 d/wk to ensure the time de- voted to RT and AT was compara- ble. An RPE of 15- 18 was used as a target intensity for each RT exercise with the training sessions shaped to 45 min. Participants completed three sets of 10- 12 repetitions on eight machines with initial resistance de- termined from 1 repetition maximum testing. When a participant com- pleted 12 repetitions in the third set for two consecutive days, the re- sistance was increased to ensure progressive overload. To assist with recovery time, partici pants rotated exercises on a 2- day schedule.

Interac- tions between corporate- trained and supervised staff and the partic- ipants consisted of brief weekly one- to-one contacts with an in- per- son or telephone counselor, with follow -up telephone and e- mail contacts and web site or message board availability. Counselors were instructed to provide the program as designed for a regular paying client, although they were not blinded to identity of study participants. Free- of-charge counseling sessions were offered to participants for the entire 2- year period. Participants assigned to the usual care group were provided cons ultation with a research staff dietetics professional, who provided publicly available print material that described dietary and physical activity guidelines to promote weight loss and maintenance at baseline and again at 6 months. This 1 -hour session was followed by monthly check -in via e -mail or telephone, and progress and strategies were discussed in a follow - up counseling session at 6 months. The diet component of the program consisted of a nutritionally adequate, low-fat (20 -30% of energy), reduced- energy diet (typically 1200- 2000 kcal/d) that included prepackaged prepared food items with increased amounts of vegetables and fruits to reduce the energy density of the diet.

Participants in PA+WL attended 24 weekly, 2 bi -monthly, and 5 monthly sessions lead by a nutritionist. Strat- egies to achieve the recommended caloric intake were discussed and performance in weight loss interven- tion was evaluated. Participants were assigned to one of the follow- ing daily goals: 1200 calories and 33 fat grams, 1500 calories and 42 fag grams, 1800 calories and 50 fat grams, or 2000 calories and 55 fat grams. In addition participants were instructed to include at least 5 serv- ings of fruits or vegetables and 6 servings of grains, especially whole grains, in their daily diet. All enrollees participated in a physi- cal activity program consisting pri- marily of treadmill walking, supple- mented with lower extremity re- sistance training using ankle weight and balance exercises. Exercise sessions were designed to be 60- 75 min, with an emphasis on treadmill walking of at least 150 min/week by week 9. - - 222 Saslow LR, Mosko- witz Phinney SD, et al. 2017 Participants attended 19 classes over 12 months, twelve 2- h weekly classes, then three 2- h classes every 2 weeks, followed by four 1,5 h classes every 2 months. Starting in week 6 group leaders taught participants in both groups about the importance of sleep and exer- cise for type 2 diabetes and encouraged them to increase both, if needed. One group leader instructed LCK participants to eat an ad libitum very low-carbohydrate, likely ketogenic diet, by reducing their carbohydrate intake to 20- 50 g carbohydrates (ex- cludin g fiber) a day. A different group leader instructed the MCC participants to follow and MCCR diet in which 45- 50% of their calories were to be derived from carbohy- drates. We also instructed them to lower their fat consumption and eat 500 fewer kcal per day. - A third group leader taught all participants supportive behav- ioral adherence strat- egies aimed at in- creasing positive af- fect and mindful eat- ing, in order to in- crease intervention adherence. - Sattin RW, Williams LB, Dias J, Garvin JT, Marion L, Joshua T V, et al. 2016 Each intervention arm involved participants attending 12- weekly group one- hour core sessions at their respective church. For FBAS, the 12 core sessions comprised the key components of successful weight loss programs such as strategies to reduce calories and die- tary fat consumption, encouraging physical activity and behavioral modification such as stimulus control, goal setting and problem solving. For HE the 12 core sessions included information and risk improvement strategies about mental health and stress, heart dis- ease and stroke, diabetes, cancer, smoking, injury and violence, asthma, nutrition, physical activity, HIV/AIDS and communicating with one's health provider. strategies to reduce calories and di- etary fat consumption encouraging physical activity behavioral modifica- tion such as stimulus control, goal setting, and problem solving - 223 Schroder H, Cardenas - Fuentes G, Martinez - Gonzalez MA, Corella D, Vioque J, Romaguera D, et al. 2018 PREDIMED. During the first year of the ongoing trial, participants in the intervention group received PA recommendations by means of a tailored face- to-face education program including 12 individual one-hour sessions, 12 telephone calls, and 3 one- hour group ses- sions focused on PA. The program was delivered by dietitians who received additional training in PA recommendation. - During the first 6 months of interven- tion, participants were encouraged to gradually increase their activity level to at least 150 min/week of moderate- to-vigorous PA, with the ultimate goal of walking at least 45 min per day, 6 days per week, and doing static exercises to improve strength, flexibility, and balance ac- cording to specific instruction.

During months 1- 6 both groups attended biweekly MOVE ! Sessions. Each session lasted approx 1,5 hours and included discussion of nutrition, physical ac- tivity, and behavior change. For participants assigned to the + mo- bile group, a goal feedback thermometer on the PDA was activated at the start of the intervention phase. By recording their foods throughout the day, the thermometer was automatically updated with current caloric intake, and participants used the PDA as a deci- sion support tool to self -regulate energy intake. No participant was given an intake goal below 1200 kcal/d. Daily physical activity goals were as- signed by increasing self -reported baseline activity level by 25% after 1 month. Subsequent physical activity goals were increased by 25% when participants met their previous goal. During months 7- 12, participants in both groups attended monthly MOVE!

The online MI intervention gave six individual MI sessions using an in- teractive, synchronous form of private chat integrated within the same website as the group weight loss program. The text -based chat was selected because many partic ipants lived in rural areas without consistent access to the technology required to support al- ternatives like video chat. Chats were designed to last approx 30 min and followed a protocol which allowed flexibility in session flow. The first MI session was conducted before the group program started. The second MI session was after session 5 of the weekly group program. The next five MI chats were offered at 3- month in- tervals. vided.

On the basis of initial food and exercise diaries submitted by the partic ipants, a unique set of small changes was selected for each participant from three lifestyle areas - food, exercise and mindfulness of health behaviors. The initiative was call \"Power of 3\" to emphasize the integration of these three lifestyle areas. Each participant was presented with three eating changes, on moving change and two thinking changes, and they were informed to focus on only those changes for the first stage of the program. After 4 weeks a meeting was held with the dietitian Small changes from three lifestyle areas - food, exercise and mindful- ness of health behaviors Small changes from three lifestyle areas - food, exercise and mindful- ness of health behaviors Small changes from three lifestyle areas - food, exercise and mindfulness of health behaviors - 243 and each team to d iscuss their progress and any issues that may have arisen. At this meeting, in a motivational style interview, the di- etitian assisted the participants to select their next set of changes. After another 4 weeks, the meeting was repeated and the final set of changes was selected. The maintenance phase consisted of five components staggered throughout the 9 months: an automated MMS -text program, five CDs, delivered once per 6 weeks to each participant at the workplace, containing podcast -style recordings of topics pertaining to weight loss and health, a team pedometer chal- lenge, a Christmas seminar, Zurlo F, Vitturi N, Ravussin E, Salvo C, Carraro S, et al. 2019 - structured dietary training was im- plemented to educate participants about food glycemic index, macro- nutrients composition, and daily cal- orie distribution.
