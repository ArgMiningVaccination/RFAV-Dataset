There is concern we have gone too far in our desire to protect the public at large from infectious diseases by mandating every vaccine that is licensed instead of only those that are truly significant health concerns in this country. There is a tremendous difference be-tween the consequences of polio and those of chicken pox. Also during the 106th Congress, we have conducted an investigation into the role of complementary and alternative medicine in our health care system. Americans are increas-ingly turning to therapies such as acupuncture, massage therapy, chiropractics, naturopathy, touch and energy therapies, herbal medicine, traditional healing systems such as Ayurveda, Tibetan Medicine, Traditional Chinese Medi-cine, Native American medicine, mind-body techniques, aromatherapy, nutrition, and music therapy to improve their health. We have con-ducted numerous hearings looking at ways to improve cancer care through the integration of complementary and alternative medicine in on-cology. I was pleased to introduced H.R. 3677 the Thomas Navarro FDA Patients Rights act this past spring. Four year old Thomas, who was shown to the world by Ambassador Alan Keyes during the Republican debates, was di-agnosed with medulloblastoma, was denied access to a non-toxic cancer treatment by the FDA because he had not first gone through and failed chemotherapy and radiation. After his initial surgery, Thomas' parents, Jim and Donna Navarro, looked at the benefits and risks of these two treatments and found that the success rates had been overestimated and that the risks were too much to ask of them without first trying something less risky. We learned that of the three chemotherapy drugs which are routinely recommended to treat this cancer, two of them clearly state on their label that they have not been proven to be safe and effective in the pediatric popu-lation. In other words, the drug had not gone through the rigors of an FDA approval process for treating medulloblastoma or for use in chil-dren. I am very concerned that the FDA will force cancer patients into treatments they as an agency have not evaluated while denying them access to a clinical trial that the FDA is monitoring. I was pleased that many of my colleagues joined me in support of this legisla-tion. This issue points to something that we are lacking in this country\u2014medical freedom. In the United States, a country based on free-dom, we are not guaranteed the freedom to make our own health care choices. Americans are tired of this and I will continue working to change this. We also looked at the role of improving care at the end of life. We learned that 38,000 World War II veterans die each month. Many of them die alone and in pain. Our veterans deserve better from us and I will continue to work to improve this. We learned that the hospice approach to care, which many of us know from personal family experience has great benefit, that has been underutilized. We also learned that many complementary therapies such as music ther-apy, touch therapy, aromatherapy, massage, whole life review, and acupuncture offer a great benefit to the terminally ill. The impor- tance of the hospice team approach was stressed as well. That is a team of patient, and care givers, doctor, nurse, chaplain, home health aid, social worker, and the tireless hos-pice volunteer working to offer care to the ter-minally ill and their family. Comfort rather than curative care is offered and oftentimes when spiritual, relationship, and personal healing can take place. We will continue working on these issues as well as working with the White House Com-mission on Complementary and Alternative Medicine Policy and improving our health care system with the integration of complementary and alternative therapies. f IN MEMORY OF DR. CONRADT HON. RALPH M. HALL OF TEXAS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Friday, December 15, 2000 Mr. HALL of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to an outstanding citizen of the Fourth District of Texas, the late Dr. L.W. ''Bob'' Conradt of Terrell, who died on Novem-ber 8. Dr. Conradt was an active and beloved member of his community\u2014and he will be dearly missed. Dr. Bob Conradt served Terrell as an excel- lent doctor. After closing his office where he practiced medicine for 26 years, he joined Blue Cross-Blue Shield as a Vice-President and medical director and served in that capac-ity until he retired in 1986. His community en-deavors included membership in the Kaufman County Medical Society and the Texas Med-ical Association, as well as serving as Presi-dent of the Terrell Independent School District School Board from 1963 to 1970. He also was a member of the Executive Committee of the Texas Association of School Boards, and ac-tive member of the Episcopal Church of the Good Shepherd, and a Scout Master for the Terrell Boy Scouts. As evidenced in all of these commitments, Dr. Conradt gave his time and energy to helping make Terrell a better place in which to live. Dr. Bob Conradt was born in Lometa, Texas on March 9, 1921, to the late Albert Herman and Lennie Mae Cornelius Conradt. He at-tended Tarleton State University, the Univer-sity of Texas, Baylor College of Medicine and graduated in the very first class of the Univer-sity of Texas Southwestern School of Medi-cine in 1944. He served in the U.S. Army while attending medical school, and upon graduation he was stationed at Fort Bliss in El Paso, Texas as the General Medical Officer. In 1947, his military service was completed and Dr. Conradt moved his family back to Terrell, where he began his medical practice. Throughout his distinguished career as a doctor in Terrell, Dr. Conradt received many recognitions, including Terrell Rotary Citizen of the Year in 1965, President of the Society of Life Insurance Medical Directors in 1985, and Advisory Trustee to the Episcopal Church and the Diocese of Dallas from 1962 to 1967. He is preceded in death by his wife, Montie K. Conradt and his daughter, Montie Cathleen Conradt. He is survived by his son, Bill Conradt; a daughter, Patricia Conradt; grandsons, Tracy and Rob Morgan; son-in-law, Joe Morgan; and many other family mem-bers and friends. Mr. Speaker, Bob was one of a kind\u2014and we will miss him. As we adjourn today, let us do so in memory of Dr. L.W. ''Bob'' Conradt. f TRIBUTE TO CONGRESSMAN CANADY HON. ROBERT B. ADERHOLT OF ALABAMA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Friday, December 15, 2000 Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Speaker, today I would like to pay tribute to man who has not only been an outstanding Member of the U.S. House of Representatives, but also a good friend and a help to me during my time in Congress. C HARLES CANADY , first elected in 1992, has been a leader on Judiciary issues, and a shining example of a citizen legislator who kept his word, and now returns to his home state of Florida to pursue other endeav-ors. There are two issues on which I have espe- cially appreciated Congressman C ANADY 'S legal knowledge and leadership. The first is the issue of partial-birth abortion. Congress-man C ANADY has been an eloquent and per- sistent voice on behalf of the most innocent and defenseless in our society. Although the outcome of his diligent efforts may not yet be what we would have hoped, his vigilance will be the foundation on which we will one day build the law that will outlaw this barbaric pro-cedure. The other issue is Congressman C ANADY 'S effort to protect religious liberty in America. Responding to the constant attacks on the free exercise of religion, Congressman C AN- ADY has led the fight to restore the Constitu- tional protections for religious expression that our Founders intended, and to ensure that people of faith need not live as second class citizens in a nation that was founded on the principle that religion was an integral part of societal life. For these reasons, and for many more, I thank Congressman C ANADY for his service in Congress, and for his friendship. I wish him Godspeed in his pursuits upon his return home to Florida. f COMMEMORATING THE ARDENNES AMERICAN CEMETERY AND ME-MORIAL HON. RON KIND OF WISCONSIN IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Friday, December 15, 2000 Mr. KIND. Mr. Speaker, on December 4, 2000, 1 and my good friend from California, Representative S AMFARR, had the honor and privilege of visiting the Ardennes American Cemetery and Memorial, near the village of Neupre in Belgium. The visit was an extremely moving experience, and I am grateful to have had the opportunity not only to view the beau-tifully maintained cemetery and memorial, but VerDate jul 14 2003 15:51 Jan 23, "}
