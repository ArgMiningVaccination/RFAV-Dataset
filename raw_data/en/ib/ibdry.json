Excellent meditations that didn't take very long to get through. I usually use these meditations to get myself out of bed. I put my earphones in, skip to my preferred session and let it help me get into a great mood for the rest of the day. 60 people found this helpful - Overall - Performance - Story - [Violet](/listener/amzn1.account.AE6TCH2OVG3JRWZZEP2TWKZDNEHQ?ref=a_pd_Energy_c15_rvlsnl_2&pf_rd_p=688a1b7e-3d44-49e7-a3fe-2be4c28264cd&pf_rd_r=Q5S7JHEWWV8E7PRPZ99C&pageLoadId=J9RbqIMUeMNDyMoh&creativeId=88c226af-6ce7-461c-9842-163d82e49648) - 05-02-18 nice energy healing meditation Nice and easy meditation that helps with chakra balancing and energy healing.

The breathy and melodramatic narration was bad enough, but I was prepared to listen anyways. However, there wasn't much to listen to that you couldn't get from meditation music. The first chapter spends 15min talking about the chakras, followed by 45-ish minutes of new age meditation music. Then Chapters 3-7 were 15 minutes of discussing how to heal with your chakra energy followed by white noise type meditation sounds to round out the hour per chapter. More importantly, Chapters 3-7 are identical, and by identical I mean copy and paste identical. The only thing that sometimes differed was the white noise. Chapter 8 merely told you the title of the book you just listened to. I feel very ripped off!! Shame on audible for selling this. It's barely even worth it if it was free. 7 people found this helpful - Overall - Performance - Story - [Anonymous User](/listener/amzn1.account.AERWJDB2LBRZCPT3SIQL7LUC2FQA?ref=a_pd_Energy_c15_rvlsnl_5&pf_rd_p=688a1b7e-3d44-49e7-a3fe-2be4c28264cd&pf_rd_r=Q5S7JHEWWV8E7PRPZ99C&pageLoadId=J9RbqIMUeMNDyMoh&creativeId=88c226af-6ce7-461c-9842-163d82e49648) - 09-05-18 so good Wonderful techniques.

The book's length isn't about the meditation. You hear the guiding for about 20 mins or so and then it's simply sounds. The sounds are good in the beginning but some of the gawking birds are annoying especially if you're trying to sleep to the sound after meditating. 4 people found this helpful - Overall - Performance - Story - [sandra hale](/listener/amzn1.account.AEXQCBNMQFDLDWAJDELUQZHSFUOA?ref=a_pd_Energy_c15_rvlsnl_8&pf_rd_p=688a1b7e-3d44-49e7-a3fe-2be4c28264cd&pf_rd_r=Q5S7JHEWWV8E7PRPZ99C&pageLoadId=J9RbqIMUeMNDyMoh&creativeId=88c226af-6ce7-461c-9842-163d82e49648) - 12-29-19 mostly sounds This book was mostly sounds.

I am upset that the chapters just repeat them self and no new meditations are found after chapter 3. I would highly advise not buying this audio book due to the last of content and shady unprofessional approach to selling a book with over 7 hours of content when there is really about 35 minutes. - Overall - Performance - Story - Angie Marshall - 06-14-17 Awful Was looking for a book to promote restfulness and help with relaxation & sleep.
