The virus spreads easily when an infected person sneezes, coughs, or speaks, sending tiny droplets into the air. These droplets can land in the nose, mouth, or eyes of someone nearby and cause illness. Th is viral illness can also be caught from airborne virus, when small particles of infectious virus remain susp ended in the air and people inhale them. People can also become infected if they touch an infectious virus on a surface and then touch their own nose, mouth, or eyes. Some of the symptoms of COVID -19 are cough, fever, shortness of breath, and new loss of taste or smell. Some people with mild cases may have no symptoms at all yet still can spread the virus. Avoiding crowded indoor spaces, improving indoor ventilation, staying at least six feet away from people outside of your household, covering your nose and mouth with a face covering, and washing hands often with soap and water can help stop COVID -19 from spreading in the workplace. COVID -19 PREVENTION PROGRAM Palmer College of Chiropractic West is committed to protecting our employees , students, visitors and patients (aka \"community members \") and preventing the spread of COVID -19 on our campus . We developed this program to reduce our community's risk of catching and s preading this virus. We encourage e veryone to share information about potential COVID -19 hazards on our campus and assist in evaluating these hazards. We will investigate all campus illnesses and correct hazards that are identified. We stay informed on the virus presence in our broader community as well as recommendations made by national and local health agencies. We review and update this plan as necessary. This plan was last revie wed on 07/0 2/2021. Palmer College of Chiropractic West will endeavor to keep this program plan up to date and based on the latest regulations and guidance. However, even if this plan is not updated, Palmer College of Chiropractic West will abide by the latest, in effect regulations and guidance notwithstanding the fact that this plan has not been updated. DESIGNATION OF RESPONSIBILITY Gregory J. Snow, DC has the authority and responsibility for implementing this plan on our campus . All managers and supervisors are responsible for implementing this plan in their assigned areas and ensuring community members ' questions are answered in a language they understand . All community members are required to follow the policies and procedure s laid out in this plan, use safe campus practices, and assist in maintaining a safe campus environment. IDENTIFICATION AND EVALUATION OF COVID -19 HAZARDS We evaluate our campus and operations to identify tasks that may have exposure to COVID -19. The evaluation includes all interactions, areas, activities, processes, equipment, and materials that could present potential exposure to COVID - 19. Assessments include interactions with a ll persons who may be present in the workplace: contractors, vendors, customers, and members of the public. Evaluations include: Identification of places and times when people may gather or come in contact with each other, even if they aren't working. Examples: meetings, trainings, workplace entrances, bathrooms, hallways, aisles, walkways, elevators, break or eating areas, cool -down areas, and waiting rooms. Rev (6/22/2021) Safe At Work California | www. SafeAtWorkCA.com 2 Community members ' potential campus exposure to all persons on campus . We will consider how community members enter, leave, and travel through the campus , in addition to addressing stationary work . Existing COVID -19 prevention measures and wheth er we need different or additional control measures. Employee Participation - We encourage employees to participate in this evaluation. They can contact Lonnie Contreras to share information on potential COVID -19 hazards at our workplace or to assist in evaluating these hazards. We will evaluate how to maximize ventilation with outdoor air for our indoor spaces and the highest level of filtration efficiency that is feasible for our building mechanical ventilation system. We will also evaluate wh ether the use of portable or mounted HEPA filtration units, or other air cleaners, can additionally reduce the risk of airborne transmission. The CDPH's Interim guidance for Ventilation, Filtration, and Air Quality in Indoor Environments will be used during these evaluations. Employees may confidentially inform Barry Pence and/or Lonnie Contreras if they have a higher risk for severe illness from COVID -19, such as those with conditions like lung disease, obesity, or cancer. They will have priority for lower exposure job assignments or working from home whenever possible. The jobs/tasks/activities at Palmer College of Chiropractic West have been assessed as follows: Table 1 - Risk Assessment Job Title or Task Description of Exposure Risk Main Entrance Close contact with individuals in close proximity to each othe r South Entrance Close contact with i ndividuals in close proximity to each other Clinic Screening Area Close contact with i ndividuals in close proximity to each other Clinic Front Desk Area Close contact with i ndividuals in close proximity to each other Clinic Waiting Room Close contact with i ndividuals in close proximity to each other Clinic/Patient Care Individuals in close proximity to each other.

This exception is limited to the time period in which such tasks are being performed . Community members not wearing a face covering, face shield with drape, or respirator, for any reason, will stay at least six feet away from all other people on campus . Unvaccinated employees may be tested for COVID -19 during paid time and at no cost to the employee. We will not use these physical distancing or testing provisions as an alternative to face coverings when they are otherwise required by Section 3205. Signs are posted at the entrance to the workplace to com municate face coverings requirements for any visitors entering the workplace. We provide face coverings to members of the public if necessary and instruct employees to remain at least six feet away from members of the public who will not wear a required face covering . Practicing Good Hygiene . Wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or use alcohol -based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Hand sanitizer stations and hand hygiene signage are placed throughout the workplace. Lonnie Contreras and Tanya Rodriguez are responsible for ensuring hand hygiene stations are readily accessibl e and stocked with soap and paper towels, or sanitizer. Cleaning and Disinfecting Frequently . Surfaces, especially frequently touched surfaces, will be cleaned frequently. Indoor areas, materials, and equipment that will be used by another community member within 24 - hours of use by a COVID -19 case will be disinfected with products that meet the EPA's criteria for use against 6 coronavirus . Disinfectants are used according to manufacturer's directions. Employees using disinfectant products are trained on the hazards of the disinfectants, to use only in well -ventilated areas, any PPE that is required, and to never mix chemicals.

Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) - Equipment Worn by Employees to Minimize Exposure In general, employees will not be required to use respirators at Palmer College of Chiropractic West for protection from COVID -19. If a hazard assessment determines respirators are needed, they will be used in accordance with Title 8, Section 5144 . Respirators for voluntary use will be provided to employees upon request in the following situations: For all employees who are not fully vaccinated working indoors or in vehicles with others . When respirators are provided for voluntary use, we will encourage their use , provide the correct size, and ensure use is in compliance with Subsection 5144(c)(2), which includes determining that respirator use will not in itself create a hazard and providing e mployees with Appendix D to Section 5144. Any PPE used to protect from COVID -19, such as gowns, face masks, and gloves, is selected based on function, fit, and availability. Employees are trained whe n and why PPE is necessary, how to properly put on and take off PPE, and how to clean, maintain, and store reusable PPE. Job hazard assessments are performed by supervisors to identify any PPE required for a specific job. Supervisors are responsible for en suring that adequate supplies of PPE are available. 8 COVID -19 Testing We will make COVID -19 testing available at no cost and during paid time to employees who have symptoms of COVID - 19 and are not fully vaccinated. COVID -19 testing will be made available to employees who have close contact in the workplace as outlined in the INVESTIGATING AND RESPONDING TO COVID -19 CASES IN THE WORKPLACE section below. Other community members (students, patients and visitors) are responsible for costs , if any, incurred for COVID -19 testing . INVESTIGATING AND RESPONDING TO COVID -19 CASES IN THE WORKPLACE Illness at the Workplace We investigate all COVID -19 cases on campus . Our investigation includes seeking information from employees and students on COVID -19 case s and close contacts , obtaining information on COVID -19 test results and symptom onset, identifying and recording COVID -19 cases, and reporting when required by the regulations. We require all employees and students to complete a Daily Tracking App prior to entering the building that screens for COVID -19 symptoms, positive cases and close contacts . This app collects information on employee and student name, time completed and date . Patients accessing our public clinic must check in and check out at the front desk and their relevant information is maintained in our recordkeeping system. Visitors accessing our workplace complete a log that includes name, contact number, date, time in, time out, person(s) contacted, and area of the workplace accessed . We will use this information to identify individuals to contact following notification of a COVID -19 case at our workplace. We will not reveal any personally identifiable information or medical information to any person or entity unless required by law (such as Cal/OSHA, local health department, and local law enforcement). Notification Employees and students must alert college officials of Potential Exposure or Symptoms or Positive COVID -19 diagnosis by completion of the relevant form from the Palmer network . Employees and student s can access these forms through the Palmer website COVID -19 Updates page or from any Brightspace (learning management system) course home page. We do not discriminate or retaliate against employees or students for reporting positive test results or sympto ms. Following notification of a positive test/diagnosis, we will immediately take the following actions : 1. Determine the day and time the COVID -19 case was last present on campus , the date of the positive test/diagnosis, and the date the COVID -19 case first experienced symptoms. 2. Determine who may have had close contact with the COVID -19 case by reviewing the case's activities during the high -risk period. The high -risk period for persons who develop symptoms is from two days before they first develop symptoms until 10 days after symptoms first appeared and 24 hours have passe d with no fever, without the use of fever -reducing medications, and symptoms have improved. The high -risk period for persons who test positive but never develop symptoms is from two days before until 10 days after their first positive test for COVID -19 was collected. 3. Within one business day of knowing, or should have known, of a positive test/ diagnosis, Lonnie Contreras (employees) or Michael Crump (students) will notify in writing , in a readily understandab le form, all employees , students, independent contractors , and other s who were on campus during the high -risk exposure period, that they may have been in close contact . The notice will include our disinfection plan as required by Labor Code Section 6409.6(a)(4) . Verbal notice will be provided to those community members who have limited literacy in the language of the written notice, or those the college should reasonably know have not received the written notice. When providing notice under this section, we will not disclose the identity of the infected person(s). 4. Within one business day of knowing, or should have known, of a positive test/diagnosis , Lonnie Contreras (employees) or Michael Crump (students ) will provide notice required by Labor Code sec tion 6409.6(a)(2) and (c) to the authorized representative of any employee or student on campus during the high -risk exposure period. 9 5. We will make COVID -19 testing available to our employees w ho had close contact with the COVID -19 case at no cost during working hours , and information on COVID -19 related benefits, with the following exceptions : Employees who were fully vaccinated prior to close contact and do not have COVID -19 symptoms . Employee COVID -19 cases who have met the return -to-work criteria and remain symptom free for 90 days after the initial onset of symptoms or the first positive test for asymptomatic cases (\"recovered COVID -19 cases\"). NOTE - Fully vaccinated or recovered COVID -19 cases listed above will have testing made available to them if they develop sympt oms following close contact in the workplace. 6. Investigate whether any workplace factors contributed to the infection and how to further reduce that potential exposure. We will provide information about COVID -19 related benefits at the time of excluding an employee from the workplace due to becoming a COVID -19 case or having close contact . Confidentiality will be maintained at a ll times. We keep a record of and track all COVID -19 cases to include : employee's or student's name, contact information, occupation, location (s) where the y were on campus , the date of the last day on campus , and the date of a positive COVID -19 test. This information is kept confidential. Disinfection after Positive Test/Diagnosis If it has been less than 24 hours since the COVID -19 positive community member has been in the facility, we will close off any areas used by the sick individual and thoroughly clean and disinfect. If greater than 24 hours will pass before the area is acces sed by others, the routine cleaning procedures in Table 3 will be followed. During cleaning and disinfection, we will increase outdoor air circulation by opening windows or changing HVAC settings. Exclusion from Campus The following community members will be excluded from campus : Those who test positive for COVID -19 until the Return to Campus criteria in the next section are met. Those that have had close contact with the COVID -19 case until the Return to Campus criteria in the next section are met . This will not apply to the following: o Those who were fully vaccinated prior to close contact and do not develop COVID -19 symptoms . o Recovered COVID -19 cases who have met the return to campus criteria and remain symptom free for 90 days after the initial onset of symptoms or the first positive test for asymptomatic cases. Employees excluded from work due to a positive test/ diagnosis from workplace close contact , or identified as having close contact in the workplace, will have their earnings, wages, seniority, and all other rights and benefits maintained by Palmer College of Chiropractic West . Wages during exclusion will be paid at the regular rate of pay on the regular pay day for the pay period. Emp loyees will be informed if wages will not be maintained because the employee received disability payments or was covered by workers' compensation and received temporary disability. Information on available employee benefits will be provided at the time of exclusion . Return to Campus Criteria for returning to work after testing positive for COVID -19 are as follows: Employees and students who have been excluded from campus must complete the Request to Return to Campus After Exposure or Diagnosis form found on the Palmer Website COVID -19 Updates and Brigh tspace course home pages. Employees who tested positive and had symptoms can return to work when: o At least 10 days have passed since symptoms began, AND 10 o At least 24 hours have passed with no fever (100.4\u00b0F or above) without the use of fever -reducing medications, AND o Other COVID -19 symptoms have improved. Employees who test positive but never have symptoms can return to work: o After at least 10 days have passed since the date of positive specimen collection. Employees who had close contact can return to work: o After 10 days have passed since their last known close contact if they never develop symptoms. o If symptoms develop , all of the following must be met: Negative PCR COVID -19 test taken after onset of symptoms, AND At least 10 days have passed since last kno wn close contact, AND The employee has been symptom -free for at least 24 hours without the use of fever reducing medication. o During critical staffing shortages, when there are not enough staff to provide safe patient care, essential critical infrastructure workers in the following categories may return to work after Day 7 from the date of last exposure if they have received a negative PCR COVID -19 test result from a specimen collected after Day 5: Health care workers who did not develop COVID -19 symptoms. Employees who have completed the required time to isolate , quarantine , or exclude ordered by a local or state health official can return to work . If the exclusion time period was not specified, one of the symptom -based criteria above will be used to determine when to return to work . Employees that have approval from Cal/OSHA on the basis that removal of the employee would create undue risk to a community's health and safety can return to work . In these instances, effective control measures such as isolation or respiratory protection will be implemented to prevent infection of other employees at the workplace.

This testing will be made available immediately after determination of an outbreak, and then again one week later ; negative test results will not change the quarantine , exclusion, or health order status of any individual . Following these two tests, we will make testing available to employees in the exposed group during the defined outbreak period at least once a week, or more frequently if recommended by the LHD. We will provide ad ditional testing as required by the Division in accordance with any special order from Cal/OSHA. 14 Additional Controls to Correct COVID -19 Hazards In addition to the controls listed in our CPP, we will do the following: Require community members in the expos ed group to wear face coverings when indoors or when outdoors and less than 6' from another person unless one of the exceptions to face coverings listed in our CPP applies. Notify employees in the exposed group that they can request a respirator for volun tary use if they are not fully vaccinated. Evaluate whether to implement physical distancing of at least 6' between people, and where 6' of distance is not feasible whether to use cleanable solid partitions of sufficient size to reduce COVID -19 transmissi on. In buildings or structures with mechanical ventilation, we will maximize the outdoor air supply, and filter recirculated air with MERV 13 or higher efficiency filters if compatible with the ventilation system. If MERV 13 or higher filters are not comp atible we will use filters with the highest rating that are compatible. We will further evaluate whether portable or mounted HEPA filtration units or other air cleaning systems would reduce the risk of transmission and if so implement their use where feasi ble. Campus Investigation, Review, and Hazard Correction We will investigate all campus illness to determine potential factors on campus that could have contributed to the COVID -19 outbreak. Additionally, we will review our relevant COVID -19 policies, pr ocedures, and controls and we will implement changes needed to prevent further virus spread. All investigations and reviews will be documented to include : Investigation of new or continuing COVID -19 hazards. Review of our leave policies and practices, including whether employees are discouraged from staying home when sick. Review of our COVID -19 testing policies. Investigation of the sufficiency of outdoor air. Investigation of the sufficiency of air filtration. Investigation into feasibility of physical distancing. These reviews will be updated every 30 days that this appendix is in effect with new information, new or previously unrecognized COVID -19 hazards, or as necessary. We will make changes based on investigations and reviews to reduce the spread of COVID -19 and consider such actions as moving tasks outdoors, allowing employees to wor k remotely or students to attend remotely , increasing outdoor air supply to our indoor campus spaces , improving air filtration to the highest MERV rating compatible with our air handling system, increasing physical distancing as much as feasible , requiring respiratory protection in compliance with section 5144 , or other applicable control measures. Palmer College of Chiropractic West will endeavor to keep this program plan up to date and will abide by the latest regulations and guidance in effect. 15 APPENDIX B - MAJOR COVID -19 OUTBREAKS The following procedures will be followed in addition to our CPP and Appendix A - Multiple COVID -19 Infections and Outbreaks, whenever 20 or more community members COVID -19 cases within an exposed group (as defined in sec tion 3205(b)) have visited our campus during their high -risk exposure period within a 30 -day period . These procedures will apply until there are fewer than three COVID -19 cases detected in the exposed group for a 14 -day period. Testing Palmer College of Chiropractic West will continue to provide testing as described in Appendix A of our CPP except th at testing will be made available to all employees in the exposed group, regardless of vaccination status, twice a week or more frequently if recommended by the Local Health Department (LHD). Additional Controls to Correct COVID -19 Hazards In addition to the controls listed in our CPP and Appendix A, we will do the following: Provide respirators for voluntary use to employees in the exposed group and d etermine the need for a respiratory protection program or changes to our existing program to a ddress COVID -19 hazards and be in compliance with section 5144. Any community member in an exposed campus group not wearing a respirator required by Palmer College of Chiropractic West in compliance with section 5144 will be separated from other people by 6' except when demonstrated to not be feasible or when they are momentarily closer than 6' during movement. When it is not feasible to maintain 6' of distance, individuals will be as far apart as feasible. Methods for physical distancing include: o Reducing the number of persons in an area at one time (including visitors) o Visual cues such as signs and floor markings to show community member locations and paths of travel o Staggered arrival, departure, work, and break times o Adjusted work processes to al low greater distance between community members o Telework or other remote work arrangement s At workstations such as cash registers, desks, and production lines, where an employee is assigned to work for an extended period of time and physical distancing is n ot maintained at all times, we will install cleanable solid partitions that will effectively reduce transmission. Evaluate whether to halt some or all operations at the workplace until COVID -19 hazards have been corrected. Take other control measures deemed necessary by the Division through the Issuance of Order to Take Special Action, in accordance with Title 8 "}
