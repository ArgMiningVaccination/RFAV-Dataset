Getting childhood vaccines means your child can develop immunity (protection) against diseases before they come into contact with them. And did you know that getting your child vaccinated also protects others? Because of community immunity, vaccines help keep your child's younger siblings, older family members, and friends from getting sick, too. Learn more about community immunity. In this section, you'll find vaccine information and schedules for: Infants and children from birth through age 6 Preteens and teens ages 7 through 18 Why do vaccinations start so early? Young children are at increased risk for infectious diseases because their immune systems have not yet built up the necessary defenses to fight serious infections and diseases. As a result, diseases like whooping cough or pneumococcal disease can be very serious \u2014 and even deadly \u2014 for infants and young children. Vaccinations start early in life to protect children before they are exposed to these diseases. Can vaccines overload my child's immune system? No, vaccines do not overload the immune system. Your child's immune system successfully fights off thousands of germs every day. Even if your child gets several vaccines in a day, the vaccines make up only a tiny fraction of the germs their body fights off. Learn more about how vaccines help the immune system fight off disease. Why does my child need more than 1 dose of a vaccine? Children \u2014 and adults, too \u2014 need more than 1 dose of some vaccines. That's because it can take more than 1 dose to build enough immunity against a disease. A vaccine's protection can also fade over time. That's why every dose of a vaccine is important. Do some vaccines protect against more than 1 disease? Yes. In many cases, your child can get combination vaccines \u2014 or vaccines that protect them from more than 1 disease. This means fewer vaccines for them and fewer trips to the doctor for you. Learn more about combination vaccines. Can I delay my child's vaccines or spread them out over a longer period of time? Experts don't recommend spreading out or delaying your child's vaccines. There's no benefit to spreading out vaccinations \u2014 and following the recommended schedule protects infants and children by providing immunity early in life. If your child misses vaccines or gets them late, they'll be at risk for serious diseases that are preventable. Can my child get vaccinated if they're sick? Probably, but ask your child's pediatrician first. Children can usually get vaccines when they have a mild illness \u2014 like a cold, low fever, ear infection, or diarrhea (watery poop).
