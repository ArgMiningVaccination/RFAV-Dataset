I illustrate this progression with the clinical case of Luca, a 32-year old male born in Italy, who explained his recovery from an incapacitating injury to his lower back in terms of the \"re-unification\" of his body, qi, and mind through zhineng qigong . As I argue, not only do qigong and comparable body-awareness practices entail techniques of movement, breathing, and visualization, they should also be understood as forging a new relationship between body-mind and self-other which may be experienced as profoundly therapeutic. KEYWORDS : Qigong, body-mind unity, healing. INTRODUCTION Zhineng Qigong was one of the largest and politically most well-connected qigong groups active during the Chinese \" qigong fever\" ( qigong re ), which swept the People's Republic of China between the 1980s and 1990s. At its peak, Zhineng Qigong numbered between 3.47 and 10 million followers and initiated what may have been China's largest non-gov - ernmental attempt to apply \" qigong science\" to agriculture, medicine, material science, edu - cation, and poverty relief. Zhineng Qigong ( )1 understood itself as a revolution - ary form of medicine and spent much of its energy on treating terminally ill patients who were given little hope by, or could not afford, conventional medical treatment. Between 1989 and 1999, the group operated two training and rehabilitation centres, which at their height treated a total of over 8,000 patients per month using only Zhineng Qigong (Winiger, forth - coming). In addition to its sheer scale, Zhineng Qigong is an interesting case of a Chinese body-awareness practice because, unlike many contemporaneous \"mass\" qigong groups, his founder, doctor Peng He Ming, has developed a sophisticated theoretical understanding of the psychosomatic phenomena induced by its practices. 1 Sometimes shortened to \"Zhineng Gong\" or \"Zhinenggong\" ( ). The name may be translated as \"intelligent\", \"intellectual,\" or \"smart\" qigong. Translated literally, qigong refers to the \"mastery\" or \"skill\" ( gong) of vital energy or \"breath\" ( qi). Usage of the term qi varies between \"cosmological, health-related, martial, literary, sexual, and environmental contexts\" (Frank, 1997, in Frank, 2000, p. 13; see also Kubny, 1995). For a theoretical overview of the concept in traditional Chinese medicine, see Porkert (1974). Note that the conception of the body has changed over the course of Chinese history (see e.g. Hsu, 2008a) and that contemporary usage and transla - tions of the term are often problematic. For instance, the use of qi as \"steam\" (Lei, 2014; 2011); the translation qi in relation to humours and effect in contemporary traditional Chinese medicine (Tiquia, 2011); or in the clinical enactment of moral-physiological and reli - gious notions such as the \"evil\" xie) and \"upright\" ( zheng) qualities of qi.FABIAN WINIGER Doctoral student, Hong Kong Institute of Humanities and Social Sciences The University of Hong Kong fabian.winiger@gmail.com \u00a9 De Boeck (IP: 178.39.119.27)128 Fabian Winiger Since the early 1990s, several studies have documented the history of the Chinese qigong movement. Beginning in the 1950s as an \"invented tradition\" (Hsu, 2008b; Otehode, 2009; Palmer, 2007; Penny & Otehode, 2016)2 and continuing with the revival of qigong after the cultural revolution (Heise, 1999; Miura, 1989; Otehode, 2009; Palmer, 2007), the story of the Chinese qigong phenomenon illustrates how a loosely defined set of medical, martial and religious techniques of self-cultivation brought together powerful political patrons, scientists and charismatic qigong \"masters\" in a shared revalorization of the mythical secrets of Chinese history. At its peak, hundreds of millions of urban Chinese were involved in the production of a new, uniquely Chinese modernity based on the \"discovery\" of qi and on the paranor - mal abilities they hoped to unleash through the mastery of qigong practice (Heise, 1999; Palmer, 2007). Taken together, this literature has cre - ated a rich but partial picture of the sprawl - ing Chinese qigong movement. Qigong practices have been understood in terms of: the transmis - sion of qigong as a form of ritualized embodied knowledge vis-\u00e0-vis the institutionalization of traditional Chinese medicine (Hsu, 1999); the construction of qigong and qi-related paranor - mal abilities within religious, nationalist, and scientific discourses (Despeux, 1997; Karchmer, 2002; Li & 1993; van der Veer, 2010; Xu, 1999); the highly visible cathartic exercises ( zifa gong ) popular in the early 1980s and 1990s; the possibilities of escape from the purview of an oppressive state (Chen, 1995; Micollier, 1999; Ots, 1991, 1994); the \"body politics\" (Chen, 1999) of contested medical knowledge in China's transition to a market-economy (Chen, 2003); and in the con - text of the epistemological hegemony of a neo - liberal nation-state (Lim, 2009). Treated by Enlightenment thinkers as an \"object to be distrusted, if not reviled\" due to its potential to muddle rational thought and dis - tract from the pursuit of objectivity (Stoller, 1997, p. xii), the body continues to be routinely brack - eted out by social theorists. However, a sustained critique by phenomenologists, in the tradition of Maurice Merleau-Ponty; the turn towards the body in British sociology since the mid-1980s (Ozawa-De Silva, 2002); the Foucauldian and feminist conception of the body as a product and locus of power; and the long \"career\" of the body among anthropologists (Csordas, 1999) have all contributed to a changing conceptualization of the body, not only as a mirror or \"canvas\" of social life, but as a productive process of both grasping and generating embodied meaning. Notwithstanding this literature, studies on the qigong phenomenon thus far have engaged with the body as a relatively \"passive entity\", a can - vas on which social, cultural and political phe - nomenon are played out, effectively \"robbing it of active and initiatory capabilities\"(Ames, 1993, pp. 33, 34). Consequently, few attempts have been made to understand what Hsu and Lim (2016), following Latour (2000), term the \"thing\" - i.e., qigong practices - in their own right. In other general discussions of the phe - nomenology of qigong practice (Murakawa, 2002),no alternative model has been proposed that places the experiential reality produced by such practices into dialogue with the Cartesian conception of the body-mind.3 2 Note that although the term qigong is widely accepted as a modern invention, at least two scholars seem to concur that it is a use - ful approximate category of the \"Chinese healing exercises\" (Kohn, 2008) or \"longevity techniques\" found in very different historical contexts (Engelhardt, 1987; Kohn, 2008). 3 A notable exception seems to be found in Sagli (2008), who has suggested that practitioners of \"Biyun qigong \" experience five dis - tinct body-mind states, including \"(1) 'body - tion, and qi ('life energy'); (4) ' qi and body movements without concentration'; and (5) 'body in stillness and moving qi'\" (ibid., p. 548). Insofar as these are understood as reflecting a generalized framework of body-mind states that are applicable to body-awareness prac - tices rather than corresponding to specific Biyun practices or to \"what other authors have categorized as 'techniques,' 'forms,' 'styles,\" or 'methods' of qigong,\" Sagli's study offers significant parallels, particularly with the first, second and third stages of body-mind unity as discussed in Zhineng Qigong theory. However, although Sagli describes the phenomenology of Biyun practices in some detail, her theo - retical framework draws heavily on Despret's (2004) notion of the \"preference for agreement\" and seems to suggest that qigong practice fundamentally revolves around charismatic leadership and social relations of power (Winiger, forthcoming) \u00a9 De Boeck body\": Overcoming Cartesian mind-body dualism with qigong practice Understood apart from their practical dimension, analyses of qigong practices inevita - bly sidestep what appears to be their most fun - damental ontological claim (that is surely made by all practitioners of this type of practice): that qigong practices principally revolve around an experiential apprehension and reconfigura - tion of the body, mind and qi. This is believed to create material improvements in the practi - tioner's physical or spiritual wellbeing. Instead of exploring qigong practices in their own right, this line of argument all too easily assimilates them into an internally undifferentiated cate - gory of oriental body techniques spanning from Indian wrestling to karate to taijiquan , where it inevitably discovers embodied resistance, com - plicity, and the renegotiation of state power(cf. Xu, 1999, p. 961). As is the case for the \"met - aphor of construction\", it can be argued that this approach, \"once had excellent shock value, but now it has become tired\" (Hacking, 1999, p. 35). Once well isolated from their research subject through insurmountable linguistic, cul - tural and geographic barriers, anthropologists are increasingly faced with informants who read their work and \"talk back.\" This occurs either by the informants taking on the role of the scholar themselves, as in the case of \"closeted\" scholar-practitioners of religious groups (Gleig, 2012), or as in the controversy surrounding Scheper-Hughes' classic ethnography on men - tal illness in rural Ireland, through overt accu - sation and conflict (Scheper-Hughes, 2001). This turns the ethical imperative to \"repre - sent them as they would represent themselves\" (Good, 1994, p. 25) into a practical demand, forcing researchers to engage with recalcitrant counter-narratives and to involve informants in participatory and collaborative research. Understanding the \"thing\" of qigong prac - tices on its own terms requires a \"bracket - ing\" or \"phenomenological reduction\" of the researcher's natural attitude in order to tempo - rarily absolve the consensual, self-evident world of everyday conduct. By recovering an attitude of wonder towards the world, one may begin a process of relearning to look at the world. The phenomenological method, as Ricoeur (1967, p. 16) points out, is in this sense a \"spir - itual discipline\" ( asc\u00e8se ), an acquired mode of perception which allows for the possibility of knowing \"things\" that cannot (yet) be known through our usual ways of inquiry. The follow - ing discussion can be understood as an attempt to use this approach to grapple with an exam - ple of one such counter-narrative - the persis - tent and emphatic claim, made by many of my informants that their qigong practice is not pri - marily \"about\" invisible social or political pro - cesses; or even a personal interest in traditional Chinese culture and philosophy. Rather they are concerned with the practical reconfigura - tion of self that they achieve through practice and the tangible benefits they feel this brings to their health and wellbeing. MIND-BODY DUALISM AND THE PRACTICAL EPISTEMOLOGY OF SELF-CULTIVATION The following discussion draws on Yuasa Yasuo (1925-2005), a prolific but little-known Japanese philosopher and cultural critic, and proposes one potential avenue to open up such a dialogue. Yuasa Yasuo is one of a small but prolific group of contemporary Japanese writ - ers who have not only critically engaged with the body, but have also developed a daring alternative method for understanding the rela - tionship between mind and body that combines insights from both Eastern and Western philo - sophic and religious traditions. Yuasa's four - teen-volume oeuvre stands out for its sustained philosophical engagement with the notion of ki (qi) found in many \"Eastern\" body- awareness practices. Characteristic of many Japanese thinkers, his work cuts across several disciplines (Ozawa-De Silva, 2002, p. 23) rang - ing from depth-psychology and neuropsychol - ogy to Eastern medicine and parapsychology (Nagatomo, 2006, p. 2). Here, I limit myself to Yuasa's speculative discourse on bodily \"infor - mation circuits,\" which he uses to describe the \u00a9 De | 178.39.119.27)130 Fabian Winiger reconfiguration of the body and self as it is experienced during intensive training in vari - ous body-awareness practices. This is discussed at length in two of his translated works (Yuasa, 1987, 1993b). According to Yuasa,\"( Kundalini ) Yoga, Daoism and (Esoteric, Zen, and Pure Land) Buddhism\" are fundamentally based on the assumption that, \"one corrects the modality of one's mind by correcting the modality of one's body\"; and that the mind, like the body, can be transformed through training (Nagatomo, 2006, p. 7). In this sense, self-cultivation is not primarily understood in the Confucian sense of the term as a social or a ritual prac - tice (Ames, 1993), but rather as \"an 'existential project' through which [...] one can overcome the commonsensical standpoint\"(Nagatomo, 2006, p. 8). One of the most influential of these standpoints is Cartesian mind-body dualism, which Yuasa understood as the, \"starting point of modern philosophy,\" and which he traced to the Christian distinction between the spirit and the flesh (Kasulis, 1987, p. 25). Unlike psy - chotherapy, Yuasa does not seek to return the subject to a \"normal\" state, but finds in self- cultivation practices a useful process for the healing of illness and for the improvement of health towards what he terms a \"supranormal\" state culminating in a greatly expanded sense of self and the development of parapsycholog - ical abilities. Epistemology, argues Yuasa, is under - stood in the \"Eastern\" philosophical tradi - tions not merely as a theoretical stance, but as the embodied corollary of an ongoing pro - cess of internal transformation and self-perfec - tion through which the subject gradually steps into a less partial and more holistic grasp of the world - a \"bodily recognition or apprehen - sion of the world.\" \"Cultivation\" in this sense is a \"practice that attempts, so to speak, to achieve true knowledge by means of one's total mind and body\"(Kasulis, 1987, pp. 25, 26), and is contrasted with the limited and disembod - ied modus operandi of the normal, untrained and separated body-mind. Following Jung, Yuasa conceptualizes this as a process of self- \"purification\" - the practitioner sheds habitual thoughts, emotions and instincts harboured in the \"dark consciousness\" of the personality, where they obstruct the practitioner's impar - tial perception of the external world (Kasulis, 1987, pp. 4-6). Although Yuasa Merlau-Ponty's schema corporel , he claim that Cartesian mind-body duality, or \"disjunctive dualism\", is not a philosophical but a practical problem and can, in principle, be overcome through prac - tice of various self-cultivation regimes. To this end, developed a detailed, four-stage typology of mind-body \"information circuits\" which map the reconfiguration of the relation - ship between body and mind as the practitio - ner moves away from the Cartesian epistemic stance and towards a more complete apprehen - sion of the world rooted in the cultivated unity of body and mind. Of course, elaborate typologies of the sequential stages of spiritual or physical achieve - ment that are believed to be attainable through adherence to a prolonged, repetitive regime of various \"anthropotechnics\" (Sloterdijk, 2013) are not an exclusive domain of Zhineng Qigong and are typically found in many religious and medical traditions. Moreover, although the four stages of body-mind unity described here bear a striking resemblance with Yuasa's four infor - mation circuits, experiences vary even among Zhineng Qigong practitioners. Phenomena typical of one stage may occur throughout dif - ferent stages and at varying intensities, or may not appear at all. They are never pursued as an end in themselves and should rather be under - stood as an epiphenomenon of the underly - ing realignment of the practitioner's body and mind. Finally, Yuasa's thought on this topic is more nuanced than can be reflected here. Rather than a systematic comparison, the fol - lowing account thus should be read as a cre - ative juxtaposition with the intent to inspire a \u00a9 De Boeck Sup\u00e9rieur | body\": Overcoming Cartesian mind-body dualism with qigong practice rapprochement between the phenomenology of one particular body-awareness practice and Yuasa's philosophical take on the mind-body problem. CASE STUDY: MIND-BODY UNIFICATION AND SELF-HEALING Yuasa's proposition that Cartesian dualism can be overcome through practice ties in with his understanding of psychosomatic medicine (Yuasa, 1987, pp. 203-232). His discussion how - ever, remains highly theoretical and although he makes cursory references to the practical - ities of Buddhist and yogic meditation tech - niques, it is unclear how the overcoming of the separation of mind and body may be concretely experienced by practitioners of body-awareness techniques. The following discussion draws on the case of Luca,4 who told his story of recover - ing from a debilitating injury to his lower back in terms of overcoming the separation between his body and mind. I met Luca during my ethnographic engage - ment with a group of approximately 500 prac - titioners of Zhineng Qigong active in Europe, North America and the Asia-Pacific between 2008 and 2012. The group had formed around the teachings of Master Zhang, a Chinese Zhineng Qigong teacher who had undergone a two-year intensive training at the Zhineng Qigong training center in the mid-1990s. Master Zhang worked at its rehabilitation cen - ter as the head of a unit in charge of severely ill patients, before leaving China in the aftermath of the crack-down on the qigong milieu in 1999.5 In his mid-20s, Luca was intensely interested in martial arts and regularly trained his body using a conventional cardiovascular and mass- building regime. One day, Luca was working out with jumping-exercises and weights, when he suddenly felt as though his feet had become \"attached\" to the floor. He stumbled, and the weight of his body twisted his torso as he fell to the ground. Struck by intense pain shooting across his torso, he was unable to move. After an initial recovery, Luca began to seek treat - ment from an osteopath and after one or two months, was able to return to his training. Three years later, Luca was studying for a master's degree in sports physiology when he began to suffer from increasing discomfort in his lower back, leading to a rapid loss in his freedom of movement. Luca's condition dete - riorated to a point where he could barely move his body and was forced to admit himself to a local hospital. He was given several injections and prescribed pain killers, which partially returned his ability to move. Shocked by the rapid decline of his physical fitness at such an early age and perplexed by the apparent futility of the many hours of physical training he had spent at the gym, Luca embarked on an odyssey through various alternative medical modalities; leading him to seek treatment from a chiro - practor, an osteopath, several Chinese medical doctors, shiatsu massage therapists and reflex - ologists. These treatments allowed him to con - tinue his normal lifestyle. However, Luca's condition did not improve and two years later he was again forced to take up conventional medical treatment. He was diagnosed with a slipped disc, two herniated discs, two collapsed discs, scoliosis, hyperlor - dosis, and \"a few more\" conditions of the lum - bar spine; and was prescribed pain killers to be taken daily. Still, his pain continued to worsen. Luca could not sleep or turn over in his bed; he lost the strength in his legs and the abil - ity to get into and out of his car. As his con - dition continued to deteriorate, his physician informed him that the only available medical intervention consisted of a surgical procedure to insert a prosthetic vertebra. The operation was given a 40% chance of success, in which case the condition would be not be expected 4 All names are pseudonyms. 5 Note that the group discussed here ceased Zhineng Qigong practice in 2012 and began to practice a qigong system created by Master Zhang. Luca's case refers to the period when the group was still practicing Zhineng Qigong. \u00a9 De Boeck 178.39.119.27)132 Fabian Winiger to worsen for some years. Luca was informed that he was too young for this operation and that if the operation failed, he could expect to be rendered paraplegic. Petrified by this pros - pect, Luca returned to his search for alterna - tive treatments, and eventually began to learn Zhineng Qigong from Master Zhang. Zhineng Qigong practice consists of both moving and standing methods designed to sys - tematically increase the amount of qi in the body through the funnelling of the \"exter - nal,\" \"original\" qi of the universe ( hunyuan qi ) into the body. This unblocks the flow of qi within the body; particularly in the bones, marrow, sinews and in the network of meridi - ans spread through the body ( jingluo). It also purifies and strengthens the qi of the organs believed to regulate emotions. The prac - tice's methods thus proceed from the relatively \"superficial\" qi at the membranous level of the body to the qi flowing inside the meridians, and finally to the qi of the organs.6 Compared with the cathartic or highly styl - ized movements of many qigong practices pop - ular in the PRC during the 1980s and 1990s, Zhineng Qigong used graceful but stiff, often strenuous and highly detailed movements that were performed with closed eyes and in strict unison with fellow practitioners. Each prac - tice method consisted of a series of repeated movements performed daily. The shortest practice, aimed to increase the amount of qi in the body, took 30-40 minutes to perform; the second, aimed at unblocking jingluo , took approximately 80 minutes; and the final prac - tice, aimed at purifying and strengthening organ qi, took about 50 minutes. In addition, a \"bridging\" practice named Three Centers Merge Standing Form ( san xinbingzhanzhuang ) was to be practiced for at least half, but better a full hour each day if practitio - ners wished to progress quickly. Master Zhang also taught several supplementary exercises used to \" qigongize \" (qigonghua ) everyday life, intended to extend qigong practice to every activity outside of formal practice time. During the 1990s, Zhineng Qigong was used to treat terminally ill patients in recovery and training centers, and many Chinese Zhineng Qigong teachers treated the practice as a serious med - ical intervention rather than as a recreational or a spiritual practice. Master Zhang thus exhorted his students to practice accurately for several hours per day in order to achieve noticeable improvements in their health condi - tion. As he once quipped to his students - \"you either torture your disease, or your disease will torture you for the rest of your life.\" According to Master Zhang, with intensive practice one gradually moves through four distinct phases of unity in body, mind and qi (jing qi shen ):7 \"Shen Thinking the Body\" (shennianxing the Body\" ( shenruxing ), and the Body are Unified\" ( xingshenxiang he ).8 From the perspective of Zhineng Qigong theory, Luca could thus explain his injury in 6 Further practices are believed to work on the qi at the level of the \"central channel\" ( zhongmai) and \"central The final practice named, and Transform to Return to Unity\" ( hunhuaguiyuan ) represents the last stage of practice, which is comparable to the \"return to the void\" in traditional qigong practice and is based on the transformation of jing into qi and qi into shen. This stage of practice transcends the duality of shen and xing altogether. The latter three practices however were never taught publicly as Zhineng Qigong ceased operations in the PRC in late 1999 due to the crack-down on Falun Gong. 7 Practitioners use the term xing (), believed to include the notions of qi and jing (), in the sense of \"kidney essence\" or \"seminal fluid\", but it also carries the broader connotation of the physical form of the human body in the sense of the \"body\" and \"mind\" ( xingshen ). Shen is denotes \"god\", \"divinity\", (human) \"spirit\" or \"soul\". It also refers to the unusual, supernat - ural and mysterious in general, and may refer to a person's expression (as in jingshen) as it exudes from the eyes, is agitated with the passions (as in \"his spirits rose as he spoke ta yueshuoyuelaishen \"), or as the person calms down (as in \"she calmed down a little ta l\u00fcewei ding le dingshen \"). My informants simply translated shen as \"mind\" or \"consciousness\", although Zhineng Qigong theory also has its own theory of consciousness termed yiyuanti ( ) which differs from, but does not exclude, the notion of shen. Textual references are taken from transcribed lectures given by Master Zhang. Citations are omitted to preserve the group's anonymity. 8 A fifth stage describes the practitioner entering a \"wonderful\" state ( xingshenjumiao ). This final level of mind-body unity, comparable to the highest level of cosmic union achievable in traditional qigong practice, is believed to be extremely difficult to achieve even with very persistent daily practice, and has been omitted as I have no personal experience or ethnographic data pertaining to it. \u00a9 De Boeck Sup\u00e9rieur | body\": Overcoming Cartesian mind-body dualism with qigong practice terms of the \"separation\" of his mind and body. This separation, he told me, is deeply ingrained in the everyday conduct of most people, but is particularly accentuated during intense activi - ties of any kind - these usually fully absorb the mind, separating it from the body and qi. Such activity is often very exhausting, as this sepa - ration scatters and disperses qi. Particularly in the case of strenuous physical activity, this can easily lead to physical injury. Sports, normally conducted with an \"outwards\" facing conscious - ness, that is, without intentionally bringing the mind into close alignment with the body, is thus understood as qi-depleting and, contrary to the conventional biomedical understanding, as harmful to the body. Luca's accident at the gymnasium in this sense was caused by his \"sep - arated\" state of body and mind. Similarly, Luca began to view the deterioration of his condi - tion during his university studies as related to the separation of mind and body, because he was intensely thinking about his research and spending hours \"unifying\" his mind with his computer screen.9 Armed with his new understanding of the relationship between mind, qi and body, Luca began to practice Zhineng Qigong intensely; at first for approximately two hours at a time, and soon for periods of up to eight hours per day. The standing posture named \"Three Centers Merge Standing Form\", which requires the practitioner to stand motionlessly in an uncom - fortable position, was highly recommended by Master Zhang to be performed daily. After one hour, the discomfort and boredom of the practice became too intense for most of his stu - dents and very few could bear it for longer than one or two hours per day - already an impres - sive achievement. Luca however practiced this exercise for three, four, or eight hours at a time. He also began to practice the \"unification\" of body, qi and mind, in all aspects of everyday life: \"Everything I was doing during the day,\" he recalled of this period, \"I was unifying with the body, any kind of activity.\" Returning to Yuasa's four \"information cir - cuits,\" Luca's \"separated\" state of body-mind can be understood in terms of the circuit of \"coenesthesis\": a \"self-apprehension or a feel - ing one has of one's own body, such as a kinetic sensation (i.e. \"the circuit of kinesthesis\") or a sensation about a visceral organ (i.e. \"the cir - cuit of somesthesis\")\" that usually \"lies out - side ordinary perception and only comes into awareness in an unhealthy state\"(Nagatomo, 2006, p. 11). Normally, the activities of everyday life, such as stepping out of a car, are not given more than a passing glimpse of attention and seamlessly blend into a peripheral flow of activ - ities (removing the car key, checking for one's wallet, checking the rear-view mirror, partaking in conversation, etc.). When the body and mind are separated, complex movements requiring an intricate but ordinarily unconscious coor - dination of the body-mind are perceived as a disjointed and absurd string of movements, and are performed in an oddly stilted and awk - ward manner. Even more so, an injured body forces the mind into opposition with the body as parts of the body-mind are perceived as sep - arate, indeed as an anti-thesis of the self. As Scarry (1987, p. 52) wrote in her seminal study of pain, \"pain is a pure physical experience of negation, an immediate sensory rendering of 'against', of something being against me, and of something one must be against. Even though it occurs within oneself, it is at once identified as 'not oneself', 'not me', as something so alien that it must right now be gotten rid of.\" Zhineng Qigong theory urged beginners to simply focus on the body so as to nudge the practice towards a closer alignment of 9 As Master Zhang taught, intense mental activity also damages the qi of the spleen. This produces or aggravates disorders linked to it (e.g. the transformation and transportation of qi in the body, controlling the blood and nourishing the muscles and limbs), or organs connected to it through the controlling and generative cycles of the five phases ( wuxing). These are believed in traditional Chinese medicine to govern the transformation of qi in the body. Zhineng Qigong theory, however, treats illness with external hunyuan qi that is \"funnelled\" into the body from the universe, where it is thought to naturally flow to wherever it is most needed. This removes the need for the highly complex adjustment of the qi-properties of the organs. \u00a9 De Boeck (IP: 178.39.119.27)134 Fabian Winiger mind, qi and body - even if the increased body- awareness seemed to heighten the sensation of separation or pain. In Yuasa's terminology, practice focused on the \"sensory-motor circuit,\" where \"sense datum is (centripetally) received through a sense organ (i.e. sensory percep - tion) and [...] an action is executed (centrif - ugally) based on it\" (Nagatomo, 2006, p. 11). In other words, practice aimed to re-habitu - ate the body-mind to its motor functions and external stimuli.10 In terms of the Zhineng Qigong stages of body-mind unity, practitio - ners performed the practice at the stage of \"Shen Thinking the Body\" ( shennianxing ): the mind treats the body much like an object, and the relationship between body and mind is one of domination and submission as the mind consciously \"commands\" the movements of the body (\"now slowly move the right arm upwards...\"). Through this practice, the sen - sory-motor circuit (mediating sensory input and motor action) and the habitualized circuit of coenesthesis (mediating kinetic and visceral sensation) become more closely connected, gradually restoring the practitioner's intuitive, pre-cognitive grasp of the world. When he began his practice, Luca lived at home with his family and his sole responsibil - ity was taking care of an elderly relative. There were few things that could distract him. At first, Luca struggled to make his body follow the instructions of his mind - even the first stage of body-mind unification, where shen \"com - mands\" the body (\"lift the right leg up and put it down on the ground outside the car door\") had become extremely difficult. Instead, his consciousness ran off into a seemingly uncon - trollable frenzy - the proverbial \"mind mon - key, thought horse\" ( xin yuan yi ma ), a habitual and barely controllable tendency of the untrained mind to jump from one unre - lated thought to another and to push ahead like a horse pulling a chariot. This was exaggerated even more when his body-mind was thrown into an antagonistic relationship through the expe - rience of pain. If his mind was not distracted with a task he could not progress with his prac - tice. Moving practices, particularly when slow and focused, often produced less physical dis - comfort and occupied his mind with a focus on motor-control and sensory perception allowing it to become more focused on the body. After three or four months of intense prac - tice, Luca's condition began to improve. At the same time, he began to experience a closer uni - fication between his mind and body: \"After a period the results were amazing. Suddenly I could totally be aware of each part of the body, where the qi was, and with only one thought I could unblock that part; I would just say 'relax' and my body would relax...\" When Luca tried to exert strength, he found that he relied less and less on the \"muscle-strength\" he had spent years building up at the gym. Instead, he increasingly felt \"like the thoughts were pushing the things.\" As his mind, qi and body became more closely connected, he required less mental exertion to make his recalcitrant body perform a movement. In Zhineng Qigong theory, practitioners who persisted in their training for a prolonged period were expected to find their conscious - ness becoming increasingly calm and control - lable, and some began to move into the second phase: shen begins to \"observe\" the body ( shen guan xing ). This was believed to occur in two stages: in the first stage, the practitio - ner would begin to think about the body as if watching his or her movement in a mirror; in the second stage, they gradually brought their observation to the inside of the body. As shen became more closely connected to the body and the flow of qi within, the practitio - ner's sensitivity was heightened. Previously painful movements or postures began to feel more comfortable as practitioners increasingly 10 Yuasa compares this circuit to Bergson's \"information system established for the purpose of 'utility of life'\", or Merleau-Ponty's \"habitualized\" body (Nagatomo, 1993, body\": Overcoming Cartesian mind-body dualism with qigong practice perceived the flow of qi in the interior of the body. As shen moved from \"thinking\" to \"observ - ing\" the body, a greater amount of qi was acti - vated. Thus practitioners increasingly reported feeling various qi sensations, of which there are believed to be eight: \"big\" and \"small\" sen - sations (i.e. a growing or shrinking sensation in a part of the body); a sense of lightness or heaviness; coldness or warmth; and tingling or itchiness. These sensations are related to the clearing of qi in the meridians and inter - nal organs. Clearing of the Yang Heel channel, for example, may lead to a \"growing\" sensa - tion, whereas clearing of the Yin Heel channel may produce a \"shrinking\" sensation. Similarly, coldness could be produced by ascending kid - ney qi, a sense of lightness if the du-meridian (dumai) is opening, and so on. Generally, these sensations were believed to indicate the clearing of blocked or otherwise pathological qi in the body - in a perfectly healthy body, qi flow is abundant and smooth during any kind of moving, standing or sitting posture, causing no discomfort or other sensations related to the clearing of blocked qi. As they progressed, many Zhineng Qigong practitioners reported experiencing \" qi reac - tions\" ( qichongbingzao ), which set in more frequently and more heavily as patho - genic and stagnant qi was believed to be trans - formed more rapidly. This often began with a discharge of body fluids such as sweat, mucous or diarrhoea. In some cases, pain from inju - ries or illnesses healed years ago momentarily reappeared as \"phantom symptoms\".11 One female practitioner in her late 30s, who had broken her collar bone many years ago, sud - denly felt an excruciating pain in the area of her old injury without having put any particu - lar strain on the area. Seemingly unprovoked emotional disturbances or mental fixations could suddenly \"rise up\" from what Yuasa might term the \"emotion-instinct circuit.\" If the practitioner was not aware of this phenom - enon, this could create the perception that their illness was recurring. Such reactions how - ever often accompanied rapid improvement in their subjective health condition. In Luca's case, his intensive practice produced strong but seemingly unprovoked feelings of anger, sad - ness and fear, believed to relate to the improv - ing qi-condition of his liver, lungs and kidneys respectively. On one occasion, while in a state of relatively high mind-body unification, the tip of Luca's index finger (on the shangyang () acupuncture point located on the large intestine meridian) suddenly, and without any cut, injury or mark, began to bleed a few drops of blood. In Zhineng Qigong theory, this is explained with the clearing and opening of the related qi-meridian. However, Zhineng Qigong does not extensively draw on meridian theory, and Luca did not adjust his practice. The bleed - ing ceased after some time. As practice moved into a higher level of body-mind unity, the quality, quantity and flow of qi in the body was felt to increase; and in some cases, practitioners developed an acute perception of their body. With intensive prac - tice, consciousness began to \"enter\" the body, marking the third stage of body-mind unifica - tion in Zhineng Qigong theory ( shenruxing ). In this stage, consciousness, qi and body are closely aligned, but still separate. Zhineng Qigong practitioners reported ceasing to expe - rience any physical discomfort during practice and a sensation of \"merging\" with the move - ment. Entering into this state of \"flow\" is akin to the \"'psychosomatic merge' phenomenon of the consummate ballet dancer or the karate master,\" where \"there seems to be a point at which the physical and the conscious become inseparably integrated and in which the expe - rience seems to leave behind the commonly identifiable and conflicting characteristics of either consciousness or physicality\" (Ames, 11 Note that this phenomenon also occurred in the first stage and even by receiving qi through external emission ( fa qi) or by immersion in a strong qi field ( qichang), but intensified as practitioners advanced. \u00a9 De Winiger 1993, p. 173). In Yuasa's four-stage model, this can be described as a \"well-developed circuit [of kinesthesis]\" (Nagatomo, 1993, p. 336). While doing still practice ( jing gong), some reported losing sensation in the body entirely, feeling as though they became a point of awareness \"floating in space.\" The experience of floating, \"walking on clouds\" or \"forgetting\" one's body entirely was sometimes experienced as a pleasant surprise during a highly-focused qigong practice and initially lasted from a few moments to the duration of the practice ses - sion. Sometimes, the surprise and excitement of slipping into this state was enough to disturb the calm state of qigong practice and jolt the practitioners back to his regular state of mind. As one practitioner, a middle-aged male from the U.S. recalled, \"the first time that happened I just opened my eyes and wanted to make sure I still had a body. Because I thought maybe it was an out-of-body experience.\" At this stage of body-mind unification, practices perceived as tortuous when the mind is still \"thinking\" or \"observing\" the body, such as hours of Three Centers Merge Standing Form, can become a blissful experience. Luca reported that his per - ception of time changed while in this state: whereas during the early stages of practice a few minutes could feel like an eternity, at this point, even several hours could be perceived as the passing of a few minutes. As the body and mind became very still, some practitioners reported what Yuasa (draw - ing on Jung) calls the \"dark consciousness\": the mind begins to \"bring up\" thoughts and emo - tions from a deeper level of consciousness not ordinarily accessible to the mind. A height - ened sense of intuition and a profound sense of serenity can arise. Unusually creative or inspir - ing thoughts or insights about their own person - ality structures and \"sudden knowing\" relating to events in their lives begin to occur during practice. A few practitioners reported ecstatic states of profound union with themselves and the external world, which emanated into ordi - nary life. As he persisted in his practice, Luca noticed that although performing the physi - cal Zhineng Qigong methods absorbed much of his day, he became more aware not only of his own body, but also of \"everything around.\" As he recalled of this period, \"sometimes I had some lapses or 'direct knowing', feeling 'infor - mation' going from a flower to a bird, it was like being there, not thinking, at the same time being part of everything.\" The perception of qi in his body and in his environment allowed him to ease his disabling pain in his lower back: \"as soon as there was some kind of tension I sent my mind there and it would just dissolve. I was feeling much, much better [and] even though I was not practicing any stretching exercises I was feeling more flexible and stronger.\" As mind, qi and body became more closely unified, the fourth circuit of the \"unconscious quasi-body\" moves into awareness and some practitioners reported feeling the flow of qi along the meridians in the body. This could become unmistakeable even during the course of ordinary life. Practitioners who attained a relatively high level of body-mind unifica - tion could develop a visceral, sometimes visual grasp of their \"unconscious quasi-body,\" lead - ing some to report visually perceiving their internal organs, sometimes in a vague and off- colour manner, but with increasing accuracy. This could develop into a practical apprehen - sion of the flux and flow of qi within the body and mind and between their self and the exter - nal world. At this point, Zhineng Qigong theory suggested that qi could be activated and healed at a very deep level, and practitioners were encouraged to remain in this state for as long as possible and to avoid getting rapidly jolted back into ordinary reality - for example, by the sound of an alarm. With diligent practice, shen is believed to \"enter\" qi, and qi to \"wrap\" around shen (shenru qi zhong, qi bao shenwai , ). Because shen and the body are unified (xingshenxiang he ), qi is believed to instantly follow the mind wherever it goes, and the need for qigong practice involving physical movement is greatly reduced. \u00a9 De Boeck Sup\u00e9rieur | Cartesian mind-body dualism with qigong practice Although Luca never attained such a highly \"unified state,\" three years after his injury, he felt he had fully recovered. Contrary to his prognosis, he has regained a full range of move - ment and feels no pain in his body during his daily activities. Another change occurred in his living circumstances: Luca moved out from his previous arrangement of taking care of his elderly relative. He was no longer able to prac - tice several hours per day, and he felt that he had lost the \"unification\" between his body and mind that had healed his condition. Ten years later, his condition has not relapsed, and the results of his practice remain. DISCUSSION As illustrated by Luca's recovery, Zhineng Qigong's understanding of the successive stages of body-mind unity allowed practitioners to develop a practical understanding of Cartesian mind-body dualism as a habitual, pathogenic human condition to be overcome through self-cultivation. Rather than an abstract episte - mological axiom generally implied by conven - tional philosophical discourse, this viscerally understood illness as caused by a lived discon - nection between body and mind, and recovery from illness entailed the mending of this split. I have suggested a number of parallels between the four stages of body-mind unity experienced by Zhineng Qigong practitioners, as exempli - fied by the case of Luca and by Yuasa's model of four \"information circuits,\" which might offer a framework to discuss the phenomenology of similar body-awareness-practices. Ultimately, intensive practice of Zhineng Qigong was believed to habituate practitioners to an alternative mode of being that not only blurred the distinction between body and mind, but also between self and other. As body and mind become more closely aligned, practitio - ners acquire an epistemological stance rooted in the fundamental connectedness of them - selves and the outside world through the flow of qi in, through and between their bodies - what Luca described as \"not thinking, at the same time being part of everything.\" Remedying the split between self and the external world along with the split between body and mind was felt to create a powerful healing effect beyond the recovery from illness. If the practitioner per - sisted, Zhineng Qigong theory suggested that body and mind would eventually altogether transcend the commonsensical disjunctive dualism of mind and body that is retained in early stages of practice. Following Yasuo, this might be usefully understood as a fundamental rearticulation of the learned separation of form (eidos) and matter ( hyle) - deeply ingrained in the Cartesian habitus and in the fundamental epistemological axioms of Euro-American phil - osophical modernity. The distinction between thought/theory and praxis/matter begins to unravel as the practitioner relearns his percep - tual field as \"pure experience\"(James, 1912) divided only by the disjunctive and conjunc - tive relations perceived to increasingly dissolve as the practitioner advances (Nishida, in Yuasa, 1987, pp. 64-70). practice praxis ), thought gives way to sen - sation, and sensation is imbued with cognitive quality (Nagatomo, 2006, p. 6). A second, complementary approach thus may be to understand body-awareness prac - tices as a process of \"enskillment\" into a \"body cosmologic\"(Lim, 2009, p. 59) - an expanded conception of the self that eschews the chasm between the mind-body and the external world. As Lim explains, not unlike the \"body ecologic,\" which describes the micro-macrocosmic self of classical Chinese medicine as a nexus of analog - ical correspondence between the rhythms and regularities of the natural environment (Hsu, 1999, p. 78), the body cosmologic proposes a self \"characterized by world-openness with an ontology which is processual [...] rather than essential.\" It is the separated body-mind that filters the \"ceaseless dynamic flux\" of the cos - mos and disconnects the self from \"pulsating life\" (Barnard, 2008, p. 322). Understood in this way, pathologies in the body are a result \u00a9 De Boeck | (IP: 178.39.119.27)138 Fabian Winiger of separation not just of body and mind, but of self and other -indeed, \"severing oneself as the perceiver independent from the perceived objective world is to expose oneself to health risks\", and \"refusal to participate in the contin - uum [...], to live one's life in accordance to the atomistic conception of self, of others, and of the cosmos is [...] the mother of all sicknesses.\" According to Yuasa, the \"investigation of the inner cosmos as a principle of new knowledge\" and its relationship with the \"outer cosmos\" may thus point the way not only to human well- being, but also to a \"new domain of empirical knowledge that will be situated between science and religion,\" where it may \"[clarify] the expe - riential ground common to all religions\"(Yuasa, 1993a, p. 361). Understanding the process whereby practitioners of body-awareness tech - niques achieve a greater unification of body- mind and self-other may present a useful point of departure, not only for healing the rift in the late-modern, alienated sense of self, but also the increasingly visible socio-economic, reli - gious, geopolitical, and ethnic fragmentation of society. As one practitioner put it, \"when the spirit can't feel the body, it can't feel the world. In truth they are one and the same.\" REFERENCES AMES, R. T. (1993a). On Body as Ritual Practice. In T. P.
