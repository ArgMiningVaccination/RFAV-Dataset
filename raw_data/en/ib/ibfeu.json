Especially from the early nineteenth century on - ward, the university as an idea and as a structure has faced a number of challenges within conflicting social and political contexts. Most of our contemporary populace assumes that universities are the foundations for higher education, that they promote teaching and the production of knowledge through primary research, and that they operate by their own principles, based on a model that is sui generis . In western European his - tories universities and institutions of higher learning date to the Medieval period, and throughout the past seven hundred years have evolved in different ways. But institutions of higher learning can hardly be viewed exclusively as a Western innovation, since many historical epochs and nations had centers and citadels for the production and transmission of higher learning. In Medieval Europe, institutions of higher learning were primarily an expression of the teachings of Scholasticism, where the central unity of all knowledge was to be found in logic, more precisely in the foundations of mathematics as a science. Mathematics was the barometer that established and measured knowledge; thus all knowledge had to subscribe to mathematical principles. Music, which we now consider as a separate body of knowledge, was always subsumed under mathematics. Knowledge that could not be understood by mathematical principles, therefore, was simply discarded, or else categorized as metaphysics and thereby excluded from the realm of what was considered knowledge. Thus, how the university is constituted and what it expresses must always be comprehended within the total intellectual foundations of a period of time, within what might be labeled as the thought of an age, an episteme or epistemes. However, through time, epistemes change, or are altered, or come to be rejected alto - gether, processes through which different sets of knowledge come into being and, in turn, have an impact on how the university structures itself and what it considers as knowledge. In this sense, the university hardly exists in a vacuum. From the perspectives of those who inhabit the university of today , what is critical is to understand what knowledge meant in the past and how it reflected dominant epistemes of earlier eras. Since the l840s and l850s, if not earlier, the university as an institution has had a series of challenges that have ranged from philosophical issues and their implications on how knowledge is understood and conveyed, to what is meant by a liberal education and by a general education, to the perennial issue of knowledge and its utility , to the connection between knowledge and reason, to debates over what constitutes a \"cultured\" individual, and of course to the structure of and conflict within the curriculum. Some of these concerns are internal to how the university constitutes itself, but others are constraints imposed by society , by private and state funding, and by the general political context in which the university and higher educa - tion are imbedded. In examining this range of issues I think about three scholars and writers who had a critical bearing on the idea of the university . The three come from different historical contexts, and so they dealt with problems that are different. At the same time, however, the problems are in many ways overlapping, dealing with the issues with which higher education must always contend: the extent to which the university is devoted to establishing new vistas of knowledge and thought, the extent to which it seeks to convey the past into the present, and the extent to which it is responsible to society and the state. John Henry Cardinal Newman's (1801-l890) The Idea of the University (l852) sets forth a vast range of issues that were and are critical to higher education. Coming from a life spent in the Anglican and Roman Catholic Churches, Newman understood the major problems that universities must confront. He main - tained that a liberal education must include not religion but theology , and that any form of general education must be committed to exploring the relationship between the subjects of study and the teachings of morality . In this sense liberal education must be grounded in theological principles, and thus Newman continuously iv argues that morality is sustained only through the intellectual foundations of theology . Yet, Newman's message ranges much beyond theology . One of his major concerns is that education and the curriculum must have a form, a structure that conveys the intellectual and theological founda - tions of knowledge. The contrast between form/structure and experience/freedom is central to Newman's vision of the curriculum. In the long run, the freedom to study merely what one chooses, a decision often based on utilitarianism, produces neither a liberal nor a moral education. Such an education only ends up as a pantechnicon of experiences. Furthermore, knowledge is simply not a matter of reason per se. In fact Newman fears that reason combined with utilitarian philosophies will undermine knowledge, since knowledge is worth studying for its own sake and the question of utility must always be secondary . Thus, the university is not a vocational institution. Just as knowledge is threatened by questions of utility , theology must be circumscribed from philosophy . For Newman, the foundations of truth remain unattainable in the physical and moral sciences, and thus we must turn to theology , the only basis for seeking Truth. Catholicism cannot be compromised with principles of religion, philosophy and humanism; consequently Catholicism is not solely a faith but an intellectual foundation that cannot be dissolved into pragmatics. Newman's vision of the university is the closest we have to an ivory tower. But even during his time, forces of culture, class conflict, and liberalism were at work while reason and the intellectual philistines were seeking the high road. In some ways the issues Newman addresses in his writings are more critical today than they were at the time of their inception. A second notable gure in the evolution of the university , Max Weber (l864-l920) was by train - ing an economic historian and sociologist who spent the whole of his career teaching and writing at the University of Heidelberg in Germany . His letters and essays on the German university system are critical in assessing not only how control was maintained in Germany , but also how the political process and bu - reaucracy led to a highly centralized structure that controlled all forms of higher education. The German university prior to l9l4 has a direct bearing on the American university , since in many ways, apart from its domination by the State, it was the model of the research university in this country . Weber's critique of the German system of higher education is expressed through a variety of voices. Since the system of higher education fell within the orbit of the German political structure (the Prussian state with Berlin as its capital), the universities, faculty , students, research programming, and curriculum were all at the mercy of bureaucratic administrative heads that controlled personnel and policy with an iron hand. Academic freedom only existed insofar as the ideas, opinions, and realms of knowledge were perceived as non-threatening, and thus the freedom of the sciences existed only within the narrow limits of what the German political and ecclesiastical bureaucracies deemed acceptable. If the subject matter of various disciplines had to gain acceptance from Berlin, the issue of how the faculty was hired and retained was always problematic. Centralization of personnel and policy meant that political or cultural voices that differed from those of the Prussian State were silenced, creating a situation in which, according to Weber, \"[E]ducation [was] the State.\" On this point the contrast between Weber's Germany and the United States is critical. In the United States, universities and colleges compete with one another for faculty , funding, and students. But in Germany during Weber's time, the power of the univer - sity , although ostensibly resting with the provincial states, in reality was held by the State, as even the local governmental bureaucracies were hierarchical, unitary , and directed from Berlin. The research organism of the modern American university stems from the German experience, which contrasts markedly with Newman's vision of the academic cloister. The emphasis on research, especially in the sciences, took hold after World War II, ushering in yet another phase in the evolution of the university . Clark Kerr (1911-2003), a third gure notable for advancing our understanding of the university , was the Chancellor of the Berkeley campus of the University of California from 1952-1957, and then assumed the v role of President of the University of California system from l958 to l967. For our present purposes, Kerr's illuminating writings on higher education go back to l963, when he developed the idea of the multiversity . Universities have traditionally been founded, especially in Germany , on nationalism and science. The American addition to the idea of the university is that education must contribute to humankind, an ideal best expressed in the land grant mission, which was and is central to the American university . For Kerr, the university is a complex institution in which power is hardly centralized-virtually the opposite of Weber's German university . Students, faculty , public authority (such as that exercised by regents), the administra - tion, trade unions, internal and external influences, taxpayers, parents, public and private foundations, and the state all impinge on any institution of higher education. While the university has always been viewed as a community , today it is difcult to assess just where the community starts and ends. Kerr's views and the concept of the multiversity are prescient for our times. They are all the more critical and powerful within the present context, when the modern university must face challenges both internal and external. It goes without saying that research and teaching are interconnected, but the chang - es that Kerr envisioned remain critical to the research mission of the university . And the university must therefore, mutatis mutandis , continually recreate itself in light of both the cultural forces at work and its own values and sense of mission. Explorations is part of that re-envisioning, that transformation. Four or ve decades ago, even less, undergraduates were hardly ever involved in research. Learning took place in something of a passive con - text, with knowledge flowing from the teacher to the student. After four years of lectures and classrooms, students might have justiably asked what was truly theirs. The context of the university today , however, involves teachers and students in a dynamic exchange, an active dialogue that takes place not only in the classroom but in the Coffee House, the ofce, and the lab as well. The research in this, the seventh volume of Explorations , attests to the power of what can emerge from that exchange. Angela Hawk's essay examines the cultural attitudes that made Disneyland such a popular attrac - tion in the Cold War era. Talia Moto explores the promise of therapies utilizing the Human Articial Chomosome. Regan Clark studies the relationship among religion, spiritual belief, and IQ. Carl Gould de - scribes a program analysis technique used to verify the correctness of dynamically generated query strings in database applications. Sebastien Betermier analyzes the relationship between the economic conditions in today's overseas territories and their political status of dependence or independence. Finally , Kathleen Feehan examines the changes among freshmen in their political orientation. These writings show how the individual voice\u2014articulating the joy of discovery in one's ndings, probings, inquisitiveness, and original research-joins in the dialogue of scholars and thinkers past and present, helping us move toward what Emerson inscribed as the belletristic state of the mind.

My research explores how these images reflected popular ideals of family at the height of Cold War politics and culture in America. Using a variety of primary and secondary sources, including archived Disney lms, newsreel footage, magazine and journal articles, park brochures, employee manuals, and photographs, I have stud - ied Disneyland from its disastrous grand opening in 1955 up to the death of its namesake in 1966. I have discovered that nature was indeed a vital part of the Disneyland presentation and was, moreover , essential to its popularity among American families. Every natural element, from the park's all-en - compassing earthen berm to the impeccably manicured trees of Main Street U.S.A., served to promote a sense of fantasy and safety that was both psy - chologically comforting to parents with \"atomic anxiety\" and appropriately stimulating for children raised on the principles of Dr . Benjamin Spock. So potent was this \"Disney version\" of nature, in fact, that most contempo - raries, rather than criticizing Walt Disney for his dramatic, anthropomor - phic treatments, lauded him for his conservationist attitude. Examining the appeal of the theme park from this perspective provides insight into precise - ly how and why Disneyland became one of the foremost cultural influences of the twentieth century. Disney and the Family: Nature as an Antidote to Atomic Anxiety When Disneyland opened on July 7, 1955, nearly a decade had passed since the attacks on Hiroshima Angela Hawk E x p l o r a t i o n s : A n U n d e r g r a d u a t e R e s e a r c h J o u r n a l 2 0 0 48 and Nagasaki. Yet the implications and consequences of nuclear power were still very much at the fore - front of the American psyche. With two bombs having already wreaked devastation on the world, pro - found and disturbing questions, both tacit and explicit, occupied the American mind: When and where would the next one hit? Would the \"American way of life\" survive a Soviet display of nuclear force? Could nuclear radiation permanently damage the health of American children? Would America be the lone bastion of freedom in a world given over to Communist forces? From day one, Disneyland was a means of providing reassurance to Americans troubled by such concerns. No mere diversion from worldly cares, this sparkling new theme park reached out ideologically to middle-class America by promoting a past, present, and future vision of American superiority . More specically , Disneyland depicted the nuclear family as being the backbone of American power at a time when millions of young couples were turning to home and hearth for refuge. It venerated all the same values that post-war families supposedly held so dear while simultaneously promoting an atmosphere of worry-free whimsy . The park's representations of nature were key to striking precisely the right balance. From the jungles of Adventureland to the wooden gates of Frontierland, the park's natural elements served a dual purpose: to help patrons escape, if only briefly , their atomic anxieties and to reafrm post- war family ideals in the wake of unsettling world events. The saga of the Cold War era family is well known and oft repeated: thousands of G.I.s returned from World War II ready to marry , procreate, and settle down in suburban houses lled with the latest consumer goods. The government aided veterans in their transition back to civilian life in a variety of ways, most notably by enacting the Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944 (more commonly known as the G.I. Bill). In addition to giving veterans access to low-interest home mortgages and medical benets, the G.I. Bill covered tuition and living expenses for veterans attending universities or vocational schools. This made family life an economically feasible, and thus more attractive, option for men returning from war. American men and women subsequently raced to the altar in the late 1940s and early 1950s, mar - rying at much younger ages than their parents. The ensuing baby boom signaled the ascendancy of the family as a symbol of America's prosperity and productivity . Historians Stephanie Coontz and Elaine T yler May rightly problematize this picture-perfect por - trait. \"The reality of [1950s] families was far more painful and complex than the situation-comedy re - runs or expurgated memories of the nostalgic would suggest,\" writes Coontz, indicating that a full 25% of Americans were poor in the mid-1950s and that most minority families, facing widespread racism and poverty , were excluded from the white, middle-class ideal.1 Meanwhile, May argues that even those Americans who were fortunate enough to enjoy unprecedented affluence in the post-war era still wrestled with issues of identity and purpose. As women struggled to reconcile their war-fostered independence with their return to the home, men wondered whether they would be able to nd work in the post-war economy . Both sexes feared the socio-political implications of nuclear power.2 It may be shortsighted, then, to view the domestic ideology of the post-war era as a mere byproduct of perceived prosperity and opportunity . In fact, the trend toward earlier marriage may have been more \"a flight from the negative [than a] solidly based healthy progression into the positive.\"3 Adults unable to nd personal satisfaction elsewhere could take pride in their ability to foster a happy family life.4 A happy family life could, in turn, be \"a source of meaning and security in a world run amok.\"5 At the time of Disneyland's ascendance, America was in the midst of \"a full-blown fallout scare.\"6 Experts and casual observers alike were alarmed by the possibility that radioactive ash spread during peacetime nuclear testing could still have damaging or deadly effects. This reality hit home in 1954, when ash from a U.S. test in the Pacic killed several Japanese shermen, and again in 1955, when radioactive rain fell in Chicago.7 Matters came to a head when Strontium-90, a deadly isotope produced in nuclear explosions, began showing up in milk.8 The frightening implications of such events made the domestic ideal all that E x p l o r a t i o n s : A n U n d e r g r a d u a t e R e s e a r c h J o u r n a l 2 0 0 4\"Disney-fying\" Mother Nature in the Atomic Era 9 much more attractive to young Americans. \"In secure post-war homes with plenty of children,\" men and women could look past their own mortality and toward the future of their families.9 Yet even as it was prompting young adults to take refuge in domesticity , the fallout threat was also casting the vulnerability of the home into sharp relief. \"How concerned should we be . . . about the amounts of radioactivity in the air we breathe, the water we drink, the food we eat, the milk we give our growing children?\" queried a Saturday Evening Post reporter in 1959.10 Americans were quickly realizing that fallout was not the unfortunate affliction of some far-flung locale, but rather a serious, im - mediate threat to the health of American families. The very weapon meant to protect the American way of life against foreign enemies was now , in fact, an enemy itself. Furthermore, the fallout threat forced Americans to think for the rst time about human complicity in the global environment. Direct nuclear blasts wreaked immediate devastation on the target area, of course, but radioactive fallout affected the global community by lingering in the earth's atmosphere for decades or more. Thus the fallout scare prompted not only a reafrmation of the domestic ideal, but also a newfound concern for the challenge posed to that ideal, and to the world at large, by nuclear technology . Americans tend to seek refuge in nature when they feel uneasy with the pace of human progress. At the turn of the T wentieth Century , for instance, many eastern upper-class men and women became so flustered with the stifling atmosphere of urban society that they suffered from a largely psychosomatic condition know as neurasthenia.11 The remedy , particularly for men, was a literal or gurative escape into the West, where the \"untamed wilderness\" would foster a sense of rugged individualism and indepen - dence wholly lost to easterners. Americans today exhibit a similar uneasiness with \"civilization.\" Consider the fate of the shopping mall. As Jennifer Price explains, until recently malls were \"targets of derision, or at least ambivalence,\" because they were decidedly soulless and drab.12 The trend in recent years, however, has been to market a themed shopping experience based on common perceptions of nature; many malls now integrate natu - ral elements, such as exotic plants and open-air frameworks, into their architectural design. Americans can now feel connected to nature even as they engage in modern, often environmentally compromising, patterns of consumption. A similar reasoning can be used to explicate Disneyland's success in the Cold War era. Disneyland opened its gates precisely when middle-class families were beset by fears of nuclear annihilation and radioactive fallout. Walt Disney was nothing if not an uncanny reader of the zeitgeist , and, sure enough, Disneyland's idealized depictions of nature functioned as an antidote to fears of nuclear America. Disney thus shrewdly linked his product with the most comforting psychological aspects of the domestic ideal; just like the suburban home, Disneyland could offer comfort and leisure in perilous times. This associa - tion was important, for prevailing cultural ideas suggested that suburban homes, with their \"swing sets, playrooms, and backyards with barbecues\" already catered to all the recreational needs of the post-war family .13 Furthermore, these recreational activities were often gender segregated; men tended the barbe - cue whilst women prepared the meal. By marketing Disneyland as a surrogate home, Disney was able to convince post-war families to come to Disneyland for their amusement needs and to subsume segregated ideas of recreation in the interest of family togetherness. Disney's \"nature\" antidote was marketed on several levels, but let us begin here with the most obvi - ous. What better way to provide comfort than to distract from the source of worry? From the moment patrons laid eyes on the huge floral mosaic of Mickey Mouse just inside the gates of the park, they could expect a day full of fun, fantasy , and carefree leisure: [T]he visitor becomes an active participant-boarding an imaginary \"time machine\" to leave the cares of everyday outside Disneyland's gates: to become a big game hunter in the jungles of Adventureland, or the wilds of primeval American West; a submarine crewman sailing beneath the Angela Hawk E x p l o r a t i o n s : A n U n d e r g r a d u a t e R e s e a r c h J o u r n a l 2 0 0 410 Polar Ice Cap; a passenger on the \"rst trip to the moon,\" or a \"main streeter\" of yesteryear.14 Jungles. Wilds. Primeval. As this 1961 news article makes clear, the total Disney experience could not be complete without patrons becoming active agents of adventure in \"dangerous\" natural settings. Nature therefore became a means to support Disneyland's immersive style of entertainment, an effect reinforced by the construction of a high earthen berm surrounding the park. Intended to obscure from sight Anaheim's growing m\u00e9lange of strip malls and cheap motels, this embankment literally and psycho - logically protected patrons from the outside world. This protective element was key , for Disneyland would hardly have survived through its rst year if patrons had perceived any real danger or threat from its escapist pleasures. Walt Disney used the illusion of danger solely for entertainment purposes, and only in situations where patrons could feel they had conquered the hazard. In Nature's Wonderland, for instance, riders in the mine train were reminded to \"sit real still\" as they crossed an old, rickety trestle into Bear Country , \"'cause there's no tellin' how long she's gonna last.\"15 She lasted, of course, and riders emerged safe, sound, and triumphant from the plight every single time. Disney simply had no use for thrilling, sensual, or boisterous amusements that chal - lenged the status quo. Forgetting, perhaps, that it was his predecessors' critiques of the \"institutions and values of the genteel culture\" that paved the way for places like Disneyland, Disney marketed his new park as a well- ordered, sanitary , and safe alternative to places like Coney Island, where degrading de - lights deliberately threatened ideas of social order.16 His strategy worked; post-war families, consisting of small children and their worldly parents, were primed to embrace Disneyland's anodyne amusements. Because they created a visual aesthetic that lent order and continuity to the park's disparate \"lands,\" natural elements were vital to the park's overall sense of security . Landscaping was a vital component of this aesthetic. Disney employed a host of gardeners to plant a variety of native and exotic trees, shrubs, and flowers, remove old or out-of-season plantings, and ensure that nary a flower or twig strayed out of its allotted space. These workers came in after the park closed in the evening and usually left before it opened the next day , ensuring that the Disney fantasy was upheld during regular operating hours. Their efforts did not go unnoticed. \"A gardening enthusiast will nd the landscaping at Disneyland almost as appealing as the rides and exhibits the place is famous for,\" wrote a reporter for Sunset magazine in 1961, adding that \"This landscaping has not been a hit or miss proposition, but well planned and organized-a complex project that's constantly being altered and expanded as Disneyland itself grows.\"17 The fact that a popular gardening magazine, read by thousands of young wives and mothers, would feature an article on Disneyland's landscaping suggests a connection between post-war values of the home and Disney's representations of nature. By extension, since \"the home\" during this era became roughly synonymous with \"refuge,\" Disney's perfectly maintained botanical utopia may have evoked feelings of safety and security during difcult times.18 Disneyland's themed nature attractions had a similar effect. As mentioned previously , Walt Disney marketed danger only insofar as it added kitschy drama to an attraction's storyline. Thus most of Disneyland's early nature attractions-Rivers of America, Jungle Cruise, Nature's Wonderland, Swiss Family Robinson, and Tom Sawyer's Island-lacked heart-stopping thrills. Instead they encouraged pa - trons to observe their surroundings and to behold the wonders of the \"natural\" world. Consider American Forests writer Weldon D. Woodson's description of his Jungle Cruise expedition in 1956: At the beginning of our voyage, we glimpse river banks dotted with lofty , statuesque Kentia palms transported from Lord Howe Island in the South Pacic. Then the Congo Queen negotiates a stretch flanked with a dark and shady forest populated with such plants as the staghorn ferns-so titled because they look like antlers. The plants which require E x p l o r a t i o n s : A n U n d e r g r a d u a t e R e s e a r c h J o u r n a l 2 0 0 4\"Disney-fying\" Mother Nature in the Atomic Era 11 no soil and draw their sustenance from the air intertwine high in the trees above the boat. . . .19 Woodson clearly took pleasure from the attraction's leisurely pace; it allowed him and other pa - trons to sufciently appreciate the seemingly authentic tropical atmosphere. Mike Fink's Keel Boats, an attraction based on the Davy Crockett lms, offered similar opportunities for stimulating interactions with nature. \"In today's world of high-speed, computer controlled attractions,\" wrote a reporter for The E-Ticket in 2000, \"the experience aboard these rustic Keel Boats on their water-level excursion across the dark green surface of the Rivers of America was still very satisfying.\"20 Often the Keel Boats were required to pull off into a cove as the Mark T wain or the Columbia passed by , bringing patrons even closer to \"the cattails and lush growth along the river banks, the many ducks and water birds, and the noise and cool mist from the rapids and waterfalls.\"21 For patrons escaping, if only for a day , the worries of an unsettling world, such low-key attractions provided security in the form of comforting views of nature, blissfully devoid of any of the real dangers or threats such natural scenes might harbor in reality . Disneyland's attractions were also a means to reassure patrons of America's ultimate superiority at a time when \"the American nation was forced not only to discredit their enemy , the \"other,\" but also to seek to dene a nationhood, a self.\" 22 Walt Disney embraced and promulgated the popular if highly idealized view that \"American-ness\" lay in the nation's historical connection with nature. Nowhere is this more evident than in Frontierland. Here trains, steamboats, and other symbols of American technological inge - nuity coexisted harmoniously with spectacular natural vistas. \"One of the biggest joys of my life,\" Disney wrote in 1958, \"is sitting on T wain belching smoke and skirting along toward the tip of Tom Sawyer Island.\" Frontierland was also home to Nature's Wonderland, an attraction which \"graphically [told] the story of the West before civilization by lling the area with life-like animated animals, birds and reptiles of all specie and descrip - tion.\"23 From the primeval West to the bustling frontier of the Nineteenth Century , Frontierland used nature to quite literally map out the course of American expansion. It reflected Disney's belief that, as historian Richard Francaviglia aptly put it, \"the frontier dened the American experience and synergisti - cally shaped the American character and spirit.\"24 In other words, Americans were better people for their frontier past and, indeed, better suited than others for leadership in a post-war world. Another area of Disneyland that invoked nature and history as a means to assert America's pre-emi - nence was Main Street U.S.A. Modeled after Walt Disney's boyhood home of Marceline, Missouri (where, incidentally , his family only resided for four years before moving to Kansas City), Main Street U.S.A. was the nexus of Disneyland. No matter where one roamed, all roads led back to the quaint, turn-of-the the century souvenir shops at the entrance to the park. The landscaping in this area was reassuringly park- like: shade trees lined the sidewalks, bright flowers surrounded the flagpole in Town Square, and various potted plants ornamented the store windows. The overall effect was one of a snapshot in time; here was a picturesque small town considerably more \"civilized\" than the outposts of Frontierland, but nevertheless representative of a simpler, quieter, and vanishing way of life. Modern observers might take in such a scene and recall Jennifer Price's critique of themed shopping malls in the postmodern era; Main Street U.S.A. was and is, as Karal Ann Marling put it, essentially \"a strip mall all dressed up in a scintillating Victorian costume.\"25 Yet post-war visitors to Disneyland, par - ticularly young families, may have seen it differently . Consumerism was an important facet of the post- war American domestic experience, and, indeed, of the image America presented to the world. Modern conveniences like dishwashers and televisions became symbols of the American way of life, standing in for the broader ideal of capitalism in political forums; Khrushchev and Nixon's famous \"Kitchen Debate\" is just one well-known example.26 Thus, post-war visitors to the park were not likely to see the Victorian facades and the commercial enterprises they disguised as a contradiction in terms. Rather the shops of Angela Hawk E x p l o r a t i o n s : A n U n d e r g r a d u a t e R e s e a r c h J o u r n a l 2 0 0 412 Main Street represented a continuity of the American experience; capitalism, and the ideals of responsi - bility , entrepreneurialism, and self-reliance with which it was associated, had enabled America, in true T urnerian fashion, to move forward in each stage of its historical development.27 Main Street, then, with its charming architecture and idyllic landscaping, represented a way to cling to nostalgic notions of the past while simultaneously exalting the values that had fostered national advancement. Yet Walt Disney's highly politicized depictions of nature were not limited to the Anaheim park alone. In fact, the park's success hinged on Disney's ability to market his product via the new medium of televi - sion: \"I saw that if I was ever going to have my park, here . . . was a way to tell millions of people about it\u2014with TV .\"28 Disneyland , a nationwide television program broadcast by the ABC network, premiered in October 1954. The show's cross-promotional format was immediately evident. Disney periodically devoted long segments to progress reports from Disneyland's construction site; each week's episode cor - responded thematically to one of the park's four \"lands\" and each episode's programming invariably advertised some upcoming Disney lm project. In a 1956 episode titled \"Adventureland,\" for example, actor Fess Parker took viewers behind the scenes of Disney's latest live-action lm, The Great Locomotive Chase.29 Disney's brazen commercialism apparently worked. By December 1954, Disneyland not only oc - cupied \"a select position among the nation's ten most popular programs,\" but had also convinced legions of TV-watching Americans that Disney's proposed theme park \"was just as safe, wholesome, and predict - able as the living room setting in which the family gathered to watch Walt talk about it.\"30 Just like the park it was intended to promote, Disneyland reached out to American families using idealized depictions of nature. Consider the aforementioned episode on The Great Locomotive Chase (1956). Viewers learn right away that the story is about a ragtag team of Union soldiers, led by James J. Andrews, that successfully destroys a Confederate railroad during the American Civil War. Fess Parker, of Davy Crockett fame, then guides viewers through the lm's production process, from the technicalities of set construction to the intricacies of wardrobe selection. As evidenced by the episode's idyllic repre - sentations of the rural South, however, viewers are treated to much more than just lmmaking factoids. In a brief vignette meant to illustrate the lm's setting, viewers see a series of rustic images set to the tune of \"Dixie,\" including shots of Georgia's Blue Ridge Mountains and a raccoon scurrying through the forest. Disney thus uses nature to evoke in the viewer a sense of nostalgia for a certain time and place in American history-specically , the antebellum South. The heroes of the lm may be Northerners, but the \"moonlight and magnolias\" myth is nevertheless on full display here. Perhaps the quietude, grace, and pastoral beauty that dene the myth were characteristics that Americans felt were sorely lacking in mod - ern society , and Disney used these characteristics to entice viewers to see the lm. The interconnected - ness of Disney media thus allowed for a continuity of depictions of nature-a constant feed of ideas about nature that played themselves out through lms, television, and Disney's new theme park. These ideas, beyond just reassuring and entertaining post-war family audiences, reafrmed the im - portance of family in forming a uniquely \"American\" identity in the Cold War era. We have already seen, for instance, how Disney used nature to promote \"domestic capitalism\" within the park, and elsewhere we see nature becoming the proving grounds for the sanctity and resiliency of the family unit. Swiss Family Robinson (1960), for instance, shows a family drawn into immediate peril when their ship (bound for America) wrecks far from the comforts of hearth and home.31 Left to combat unpredictable forces of nature on a deserted island, the Robinsons immediately demonstrate ingenuity and survival skills of the highest order. In no time at all, they have created a kind of domestic utopia out of the natural resources available to them (memorialized, of course, in the Swiss Family Robinson Tree House in Disneyland), and are enjoying the splendors of life in their very own Garden of Eden. Nature therefore becomes a means for this ideal immigrant family (white, Teutonic) to reafrm the domestic ideal in even the most threatening of circumstances. Another Disney lm from the same year, The Parent T rap , also uses natural E x p l o r a t i o n s : A n U n d e r g r a d u a t e R e s e a r c h J o u r n a l 2 0 0 4\"Disney-fying\" Mother Nature in the Atomic Era 13 settings to facilitate a sense of familial harmony . The popularity of these lms attests to the appeal of such portrayals. Nature that was safe and family-friendly was innitely preferable to a savage wilderness hos - tile to man, for where else, if not to nature, could one turn for comfort in an era of technological threats to civilization? Furthermore, by establishing an intimate connection between nature and the home, Disney allowed family audiences to feel like they were in touch with nature even as their daily interactions with the natural world became increasingly removed. This leads us, nally , to a discussion of Disney's wildly popular T rue Life Adventure lms. These feature length nature documentaries, including Seal Island (1948), The Living Desert (1953), and The V anishing Prairie (1954), earned the Disney Studio accolades and prot at a time when its animated fea - tures were breaking even at best. Taken together, they form the basis for most scholarly discussions on Disney's representations of nature. Steven Watts perhaps best explains the lms' popularity among family audiences specically , noting that these lms \"depicted a taming of natural forces that appealed to an American audience becoming increasingly suburbanized and family-oriented.\"32 This \"domestication of nature\" took shape in the form of humorous and poignant parallels between human and animal families. Note Walt Disney's description of a bear family that they observed while photographing in Montana: I think that bears are the best mothers. Photographing in the wilds of Montana and Wyoming, we spied on Mrs. Black Bear, handsome in her ne fur coat, for the better part of two seasons. We saw her come out of her winter cave with two fat little cubs to begin their education. Father bear had nothing to do with the rearing of his youngsters-in fact, he'd been chased off the premises by Mamma before they were born.33 In his humorous and anecdotal way , then, Disney dened a \"family experience\" common to all living beings. Although many reject this patently anthropomorphic way of thinking today , in the 1950s it was widely accepted. By tapping into \"our human tendency to look on animals as extensions of ourselves,\" Disney brought reassuring and entertaining views of the animal world to the masses.34 Scenes in the T rue Life Adventure lms sometimes seemed to directly mirror the concerns of the ar - chetypal post-war family . In The V anishing Prairie , for instance, viewers are introduced to members of an upstanding prairie dog family who diligently maintain their burrow . This \"home and haven,\" however, is frequently subject to external threats, the worst of which is a devastating wildre.35 The prairie dogs are able to wait out the worst of the danger by hiding underground, but the floods that follow irreparably damage their burrow . As the prairie dogs scurry off in search of a new home, the narrator quips: \"It's a hard decision to make, leaving the old homestead.\"36 The saga of prairie dog family , as told here, could almost be an account of a family's experience af - ter nuclear war: just as the prairie dogs go underground to avoid the re, so might the besieged human family seek refuge in a bomb shelter, and just as our animal friends must abandon their former haven, so might a family nd their home devastated in the wake of a nuclear attack. Yet the overriding theme in the prairie dog saga is one of hope, not sorrow; the prairie dogs may have to seek shelter elsewhere, but they ultimately survived the re's devastation. This plot sent a message to post-war families: a nuclear at - tack may wreak havoc on life and society , but, if proper precautions are taken, the family unit will remain intact. It is difcult to say whether family audiences consciously recognized this message, or even that Disney purposely conveyed it, but at the very least the T rue Life Adventure lms appealed to families on the basis of situations and hopes that would have felt familiar, conveyed by the humanized portrayals of animals and unthreatening interpretations of nature. From Disneyland to Disneyland and beyond, nature became a way for the Disney Company to tap into the innermost fears and desires of the post-war American family . Never mind that Disney's ano - dyne vision of nature obscured the true dynamism of the environment, or that it sometimes perpetuated Angela Hawk E x p l o r a t i o n s : A n U n d e r g r a d u a t e R e s e a r c h J o u r n a l 2 0 0 414 historical myths and half-truths; for families grappling with the repercussions of nuclear power and Cold War political culture, safe, static, and reassuring depictions of nature were immediately appeal - ing. Furthermore, Disney's nature was 100% guilt-free. From the wilds of Adventureland to the prairie dog holes of The V anishing Prairie , Disney consumers were made to feel as if they were in sync with the natural world but not responsible for it. Disney's world was unlike the real world in that one did not have to think about the consequences of fallout to the environment or one's health; Disney's nature would always be perfect, no matter what. Finally , Disney created a vision of nature that was indelibly linked to middle-class family values. All the Cold War ideals that families supercially or genuinely paid hom - age to-responsibility , order, duty , ingenuity , resiliency , free enterprise-were somehow incorporated into storylines or attractions that also implicated nature. Nature therefore played a crucial role in attracting and sustaining a family demographic during Disneyland's rst decade, and is no doubt a major factor in the park's continued success. Nature as Edutainment: The Baby Boomer Generation Does Disneyland Walt Disney always insisted that Disneyland cater to adults as well as to children, and, indeed, the park's attractions appealed to an older audience in a variety of conscious and subconscious ways. Yet there is simply no denying Disneyland's child-centric focus, particularly during the Cold War era. Years before Big Thunder Mountain Railroad and Space Mountain made the park more accessible to single adults and teenagers, kid-friendly attractions like the Casey Jr. Circus Train and Tom Sawyer's Island created a haven for families with young children. Such attractions were laden with idealized depictions of the natural world, most of which promoted nature as a source of both education and entertainment. Primary source accounts reveal that such depictions were not at all lost on contemporary observers; newspaper columnists, schoolteachers, and conservationists alike lauded Disney for his unique brand of edutain - ment. This enthusiastic response indicates, perhaps, that Disney had opportunely tapped into prevail - ing cultural ideas about modes of child-rearing and child socialization in the post-war era. Although traditional attitudes toward parenting that advocated strict discipline were still widespread, new theories about democratizing childhood, fostering individualism and emphasizing education were coming to the fore. By giving children a safe yet relatively free-form \"natural\" environment in which to play and learn, Walt Disney endorsed these ideas and subsequently reaped the benets. In the years before World War II, ideas about childrearing centered on the concept that motherhood was a vocation, and that the competent mother would rely more on acquired expertise than instinct while raising her children.37 The role of the father, meanwhile, signicantly declined. Although these devel - opments generally allowed for \"more relaxed authority bonds and an increased capacity for empathetic relations\" between parent and child, stringent discipline was still very much seen as a vital aspect of the socializing process.38 In Infant Care , the best-selling child-care manual rst published in 1914, author Mary Mills West advocated \"strict scheduling\" and advised against \"rocking, tickling, or playing with infants.\"39 Such advice was intended not only to encourage proper socialization of the child, but also to protect the mother's mental and physical wellbeing.40 Thus, although children were now seen primarily as products of the domestic sphere rather than contributors to the workforce, they were still subject to what Glenn Davis terms \"vigorous guidance.\"41 To unduly indulge one's child or to eschew professional advice was to ill equip one's child for the adult world. As previously noted, the end of World War II prompted a renewed emphasis on the family in America. As part of that focus, procreation took on \"almost mythic proportions,\" in terms both of its place in the cultural and political rhetoric of the period and of the sheer numbers of people choosing to have chil - dren.42 Thus millions of young men and women chose to formulate a home life based on the ideal of rais - ing a brood of upstanding, well-adjusted children. This ideal prompted a transition away from the more E x p l o r a t i o n s : A n U n d e r g r a d u a t e R e s e a r c h J o u r n a l 2 0 0 4\"Disney-fying\" Mother Nature in the Atomic Era 15 stringent methods of discipline advocated in the pre-war years and toward more democratic, instinctual approaches to childrearing. Nowhere is this better encapsulated than in the work of Dr. Benjamin Spock. Spock's The Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care has achieved a kind of revered cultural status unusual for a book, having sold more than 30 million copies since its original publication in 1946.43 First and foremost, Spock encouraged the post-war mother to rely on her own instincts. \"You know more than you think you do,\" he writes, so \"don't be afraid to trust your own common sense.\"44 Rather than the rigid modes of discipline advocated by early child-rearing manuals, what children really needed was \"spontaneous love, spontaneous discipline, an unanalyzed spur-of-the-moment spank followed by an unanalyzed spur-of-the-moment kiss.\"45 Although many mothers of the post-war era undoubtedly still based their child-rearing tactics primarily on their own childhood experience, the influence of Spock's ideas in the post-war era cannot be denied. The post-war era was also marked by a renewed concern for primary and secondary education, par - ticularly after the Russians launched the Sputnik satellite on October 4, 1957. Had America fallen behind the Russians because its schools did not effectively teach the rudiments of science, mathematics, and engineering? In the wake of Sputnik, the formerly ambivalent Congress scrambled to enact the National Defense Education Act. In addition to providing funding for school construction and equipment, the NDEA set up fellowships, grants, and loans for students interested in science.46 Yet the critique went far beyond the lack of schools or school resources; many saw a need for a reformed curriculum that stressed \"discovery\" over memorization.47 Specically , reformers \"hoped to end the traditional reliance on a single textbook by creating attractive multimedia packages that included lms, \"hands-on\" activities, and read - ings.\"48 Dr. Spock echoed this sentiment in Baby and Child Care : \"You can only go so far with books and talk,\" he cautions. \"You learn better from actually living the things you are studying.\"49 Thus the threat of Russia's technological prowess prompted not only a renewed emphasis on a science-enriched curriculum, but also a search for more effective, dynamic modes of learning. Disneyland opened just as these new ideas about childrearing were percolating in the American consciousness, and Walt Disney immediately embraced his role as the benevolent foster uncle of millions of American children. Much like Spock, Disney believed that children should be allowed to explore their own individuality , to have fun, and to learn by personal experience. Though always careful in interviews to reafrm his primary role as an entertainer, not an educator, Disney displayed a vested interest in the educational experience of America's children. Like other commentators on the \"crisis in the schools,\" he believed America's continued preeminence in the era of Cold War politics depended upon rejuvenating the nation's educational system: We must stimulate high school science and make it fascinating for the children. . . . As long as we're on our toes it won't be like 1940. You hear the talk-\"We're behind the Russians!\" or \"We're way ahead of the Rus - sians!\" But there is a war going on that we are not conscious of.50 Furthermore, Disney believed in the ability of his products to augment national efforts to uplift and enlighten America's youth. He described Disneyland in 1954 as a \"combination of a world's fair, a playground, a community center, a museum of living facts, and a show place of beauty and magic,\" thus underscoring the park's quasi-educational format.51 Thus, despite his declarations to the contrary , Disney clearly envisioned Disneyland not only as a forum for amusement, but also as an exemplar of America's educational ideals. Disneyland's representations of nature played a key role in promoting these ideals. The Grand Canyon Diorama on the Santa Fe/Disneyland Railroad, for instance, was more of a museum exhibit than a typical amusement park attraction; patrons simply gazed through a glass window at models of the Arizona land - mark's beautiful vistas and diverse array of wildlife. Similarly , Frontierland was not only a playground Angela Hawk E x p l o r a t i o n s : A n U n d e r g r a d u a t e R e s e a r c h J o u r n a l 2 0 0 416 for the aspiring cowboy , but also an allegorical lesson in American history: The Burning Settler's Cabin one encountered on the trip down Rivers of America was a testimony to the dangers the pioneers faced in the western wilderness. The Indian Village provided a fleeting glimpse of the cultures that dotted the North American landscape prior to European expansion. The Frontierland shooting gallery gave children a chance to emulate famous historical hunter/trapper gures like Daniel Boone. Nature's Wonderland al - lowed [to] enjoy nature as it is or as it was . delity .\"52 Thus each attrac - tion in Frontierland was a means to convey some important message about the history of the American frontier (as Cold War Americans understood it) in a fun and accessible way . As any '50s child with access to a television set would know , Disney's lessons in frontier history were not limited to the Anaheim park. Indeed, Disney's idealized, almost mythic portrayals of the American frontier gained their cultural foothold not through Frontierland, but through a series of Disneyland epi- sodes chronicling the adventures of frontier gure Davy Crockett. First aired in 1954, and later recycled into two enormously popular feature lms, these episodes prompted a bona-de marketing craze perhaps rivaled only by the Pokemon fad of the late 1990s. Coonskin caps, Indian peace pipes, frontier board games, and Davy Crockett playsuits became the must-have items of the young baby boomer generation, and Fess Parker as Crockett became an overnight hero.53 An anonymous news segment from 1955 shows young children sleeping, bathing, and even toilet training with their beloved Davy Crockett items.54 The sheer intensity of the craze alarmed even those who stood to prot from it; as historian J. G. Boyle has noted, \"no one had anticipated that children were a consumer power, not even Disney .\"55 If anyone had the inside track on the phenomenon, it was probably the pocketbook-wielding parents of these pint-sized pioneers. As one bewildered lm critic/father noted, According to the 9-year old frontiersman who shacks at our house when he isn't in school or out on some other important business in the line of duty of a young pioneer, the greatest-but denitely THE greatest-cul - tural experience he has had since \"Destination Moon\" was watching the three-part TV showings of Walt Disney's \"Davy Crockett\" lms.56 Why the reverence on the part of American children for the Davy Crockett story? What was it about this historical gure that, when set into the Disney mold, inspired such ubiquitous fervor? And why , when prompted on the subject years later, does Fess Parker say \"it would almost be a public service\" to make early Disney westerns like Davy Crockett widely available to children today?57 The answer lies, again, in the way Disney marketed frontier nature as a kind of unconventional classroom for learning about American history and American values. Taking considerable liberties with the actual events of his life, Disney portrayed Davy Crockett as both a brazen pioneer unafraid to face the dangers of the wilderness (he \"killed him a b'ar when he was only three,\" after all) and a rugged individualist unable to fully adapt to civilized society . The ideology that emerges from such a character - ization has decidedly Cold War overtones; Crockett was the embodiment of the \"homespun folk hero,\" the \"self-sacricing volunteer,\" the \"virtuous common man\" that Cold War politicos so often referenced in their rhetoric.58 Yet it was not the politicos that were wearing their coonskin caps to school or lugging their rifles into the bathtub. Children enjoyed the Davy Crockett story and the merchandising that fol - lowed because it allowed, nay encouraged them to reenact the frontier narrative on their very own turf. Rifle in hand, coonskin cap tilted rakishly to one side, a young boy could almost imagine that the willow tree in his backyard was a dense patch of forest hiding untold dangers. Thus the patterns of play that Davy Crockett encouraged became a means for children not only to flex their consumer muscles but also to engage with history , and nature, in a dynamic, \"hands-on\" way . Tom Sawyer's Island was Disneyland's answer to the Davy Crockett craze. Introduced in 1956, it encouraged young children to emulate their onscreen hero on an elaborate playground disguised as a E x p l o r a t i o n s : A n U n d e r g r a d u a t e R e s e a r c h J o u r n a l 2 0 0 4\"Disney-fying\" Mother Nature in the Atomic Era 17 frontier outpost. \"You'll explore Injun Joe's Cave, watch 'wild animals' from Fort Wilderness, climb to Lookout Peak, and cross the Suspension Bridge,\" reported a Disneyland publication in 1956. \"You'll even sh from piers, where bait and tackle are available.\" 59 Tom Sawyer's Island had an air of authenticity about it that no suburban backyard could match. In a 1958 article for T rue West , Disney touted the attrac - tion as a veritable journey into history , where the stockades of Fort Wilderness resembled \"the regimental headquarters where Davy Crockett and George Russell reported to Maj. Gen. Andrew Jackson in the Cherokee Indian campaign of 1813\" and Injun Joe's Cave harkened \"back to the caves I used to explore in Hannibal [Missouri].\"60 Disney's attempts to legitimize Tom Sawyer's Island for a young readership sug - gest that, for him, the attraction was as much an educational tool as it was a freeform playground. Here children could expend their energies engaging in the idealized pastimes of their forebears, interacting with and exerting dominance over the natural world, and learning about the great American West. Elsewhere Disney displayed an avid interest in promoting the natural sciences. Disney's popular T rue Life Adventure nature lms, for example, introduced young American audiences to wildlife biology in its crudest form. Replete with kitschy commentary from a voice-over narrator, these lms centered on dramatic or funny occurrences in the animal world, such as a standoff between a raptor and a rattlesnake or the mating antics of a Sandhill crane. In this way , they represented the beginning of the kind of drama - tized but informative documentary style that would later become the norm for wildlife programs. Their influence was such that many schoolteachers began using them in their regular curriculum. By February 1956, Nature' s Half-Acre had already been made available to schools, and, in a speech to the Probationary and Substitute Teacher's Organization, studio executive Larry Wagner estimated that some \"fty percent of Walt Disney's forthcoming productions will have educational implications.\"61 Explaining the studio's new focus, Wagner noted, \"Walt Disney is imbued with a deep responsibility to the millions of youngsters who see his movies.\"62 The idea, perpetuated by Disney , that the T rue Life Adventure lms were virtually a public service (a South Pasadena library held a free screening of Beaver V alley and Seal Island in 1955) perhaps obscures the fact that they were enormously protable for the Walt Disney Company . Still, their unparalleled popularity in both commercial and educational forums suggests that safe, even humorous, portrayals of nature were widely embraced as being authentic and instructive, and, indeed, that Disney had effectively become part entertainment mogul, part civic benefactor. So completely had Disney assumed the latter role that some schools paid homage to him with nam - ing rights. One such institution, the Walt Disney School in T ullytown, Pennsylvania, opened in 1955 with a ceremony t for a governor.63 Residents gathered en masse at the local train station to greet Disney , where some held up welcome signs and others wore coonskin caps or Pinocchio masks. After his arrival, Disney headed to the onsite dedication ceremony . There he received a painting of the new school and a few oft-rehearsed sentiments from a young boy: \"One reason [we named the school after you] is because we love you, as do all the children throughout the world.\"64 At the conclusion of the ceremony , Disney posed for a photo with several students, presided over the sealing of a time capsule, and was then invited on a tour around the Disney-themed buildings. \"Never Never Land,\" \"Tinkerbell,\" and \"Pleasure Island,\" (the detention hall, phone booth, and gymnasium, respectively) are perhaps the ultimate testaments to the enthusiasm with which T ullytown embraced Walt Disney , and the entire scenario an indicator that Americans had readily accepted Disney's unique brand of edutainment. Disneyland provided a forum for children to assert some measure of independence in a carefully controlled play setting. They could choose where they wanted to go and what they wanted to see, within reason, and those attractions they did visit were not only entertaining but also educational. This was particularly true of Disney's nature attractions, which often taught children more about the Disney ver - sion of American history than about the natural world. Similarly , Disney lms and television programs conveyed to a nationwide audience of children ideas about nature that were engaging, non-threatening, Angela Hawk E x p l o r a t i o n s : A n U n d e r g r a d u a t e R e s e a r c h J o u r n a l 2 0 0 418 and instructive. In the case of Davy Crockett , these ideas reflected the same values of individualism and democracy that politicians and child-rearing experts so strongly emphasized in the post-war era and also the sense of adventure that appealed to young children. Meanwhile, the T rue Life Adventure series gave Walt Disney a kind of legitimacy in educational circles. Disney therefore emerged on the winning side of the educational debate that had raged even before the launch of Sputnik; when the prevailing winds of change favored more dynamic modes of learning, Disney's sparkling new playground in Anaheim looked all the more inviting. What is \"Real,\" Anyway?: Marketing an Audio-Animatronic Paradise Walt Disney went to great lengths to ensure that Disneyland's approximations of nature appeared as realistic as possible without being boring or threatening, and, for reasons already explored, post- war, middle-class families generously rewarded his efforts. Yet, in the eyes of elite critics, such \"tawdry substitutes\" were not to be borne; nature was too sacred an entity to be cheapened for the purposes of mass consumption. This fundamental difference in opinion between critics and the masses reveals a great deal not only about the role of class in dening ideas about nature, but also about the great \"au - thentic vs. inauthentic\" debate still raging in environmental scholarship. Disneyland's various nature attractions touted images of \"wild\" nature that seemed real but that were actually the product of human ingenuity and state-of-the-art technology . Although it disgusted critics, this incongruity did little to deter middle-class patrons; if anything, it made the park all that much more appealing. At a time when sub - urban growth and increased consumerism combined to make Americans feel much more isolated from the environment, Disney's approximations of nature were imbued with just the right balance of realism and anthropomorphism to \"remind\" patrons of their intimate connection with the natural world. Thus Disney was able to market Disneyland as a kind of natural development in itself, ensuring its success by obscuring its synthetic origins. During an hour-long television special commemorating Disneyland's tenth anniversary in 1965, Walt Disney gave viewers a retrospective glimpse into the park's construction process. He recalled his original visits to the proposed site, which then consisted of only \"an orange grove and some farm houses,\" and re - membered personally pacing off the outlines of the 200-acre park.65 These memories are reinforced with video footage of Disney , decked out in a cowboy hat and jeans, traipsing purposefully through the elds of Anaheim and showing a boyish enthusiasm for his pet project. \"If you want anything done right,\" he says, \"you've gotta do it yourself.\"66 Although short and seemingly trivial, this small segment speaks volumes about how Disney wanted to market Disneyland to the American public. Aided by a lively folk music soundtrack, it perpetuated the idea that from the very beginning, Disneyland was more a western homesteading venture spearheaded and held aloft by one man than a complex corporate endeavor requir - ing the services and resources of thousands of individuals. As such, the modications to the land Disney's vision required, such as the carving out of hills and riverbeds and the clearing of orange trees to make way \"for more exotic foliage and plants,\" took on an air of cultivation rather than destruction.67 Equating Disneyland with the homestead ideal may have been a way for Disney to downplay the im - pact of Disneyland on the Anaheim landscape. With the opening of the park in 1955, the former farming community became the locus of a booming tourist industry . New motels and businesses, of varying size and quality , seemed to appear overnight, their proprietors eager to serve the thousands of out-of-towners descending daily upon the area. The new Santa Ana Freeway , completed just prior to the park's open - ing, became so congested within the rst few months that the Automobile Club of Southern California released a map designating alternate routes from the freeway to the park.68 Meanwhile, sparkling new suburban housing developments advertised their proximity to the park as a lure to potential residents.69 To be sure, many Anaheim residents embraced Disneyland as an invaluable source of revenue and E x p l o r a t i o n s : A n U n d e r g r a d u a t e R e s e a r c h J o u r n a l 2 0 0 4\"Disney-fying\" Mother Nature in the Atomic Era 19 publicity for the community . In an editorial for the Anaheim Bulletin in 1955, resident Howard Loudin made the optimistic, if dubious, claim that \"any business established to bring happiness cannot develop into a detriment to the community in which it is situated.\"70 Furthermore, Walt Disney fully realized the importance of Disneyland to Anaheim's bottom line and frequently used that knowledge in his favor in local politics. Yet, as historian John Findlay has noted, some felt a profound ambivalence toward the park. These individuals blamed Disneyland for a variety of problems stemming from the town's sudden growth spurt, most notably the unattractive commercial strip along Harbor Boulevard.71 Even Disney himself displayed a growing unease with Anaheim's urban sprawl, although he seemed unable to acknowledge fully his own complicity in it. It was, in fact, his frustration with the \"cheap and tawdry\" establishments that \"detracted from Disneyland's atmosphere while cashing in on its crowds of visitors\" that led him to try again with Disney World in Florida.72 Thus, Walt Disney extolled the virtues of homespun values and simple living even as he perpetuated Anaheim's ascent (or descent?) into urbanity . He invited patrons to forge connections with a geographi - cally and topographically diverse natural world that did not exist before 1954. He held up Disneyland as a harbinger of wealth and prosperity to Anaheim even as he denigrated the more unseemly aspects of the town's new urban character. How does one explicate these seeming contradictions? William Cronon's controversial essay , \"The Trouble with Wilderness; or, Getting Back to the Wrong Nature,\" might provide a good starting point: To the extent that we live in an urban-industrial civilization but at the same time pretend to ourselves that our real home is in the wilderness, to just that extent we give ourselves permission to evade responsibility for the lives we actually lead. We inhabit civilization while holding some part of ourselves-what we imagine to be the most precious part-aloof from its entanglements.73 Although he would never phrase it as Cronon did, perhaps Disney envisioned Disneyland as the \"real\" in an increasingly \"surreal\" urban landscape. Perhaps Disneyland was Disney's tacit permission to the American public to pretend, if only for a day or a week, that man-made rivers and audio-animatronic animals were the real thing and that the only thing standing in the way of getting back to nature was a small admission fee. That Disney may have felt this way is perhaps evidenced by his bitter battles to keep the Anaheim skyline clear of hotel high-rises. The issue came to a head in 1963, when the Sheraton Hotel Company announced its intentions to build a twenty-two story hotel near the park.74 Disney complained to the Anaheim city council that visitors would be able to see the proposed building from within the park's pro - tective berm, and that such a blight would ruin Disneyland's sense of fantasy . Anaheim ultimately sided with Disney , and, for a time, the only high-rise in the area was Disney's own Matterhorn. Yet, one must wonder: was it fantasy that Disney sought to protect, or a kind of altered reality? After all, \"even before its completion, the Matterhorn was the tallest mountain in Orange County .\"75 It \"helped bring visual order\" to an area at a loss for real topographical landmarks, and thus became, for better or worse, an enduring xture of the Southern California landscape.76 Whatever the true nature of Disney's motivations, contemporary critics argued that Disney was simply trying to pull one over on the American public; by enticing patrons with machines disguised as animals, fake mountains, and cheesy river rides, Disneyland was the epitome of the modern capitalist cash cow that was being milked for all it was worth. \"As in the Disney movies, the whole world, the uni - verse, and all man's striving for dominion over self and nature, have been reduced to a sickening blend of cheap formulas packaged to sell,\" wrote novelist Julian Halevy for The Natio n in 1958.77 \"To me [the park] felt like a giant cash register,\" commented another observer, \"clicking and clanging, as creatures Angela Hawk E x p l o r a t i o n s : A n U n d e r g r a d u a t e R e s e a r c h J o u r n a l 2 0 0 420 of Disney magic came tumbling down from their lofty places in my daydreams.\"78 Richard Schickel, the well-known lm critic and author of the controversial book The Disney V ersion , called audio-animatron - ics a \"grotesquery .\"79 The American public, by and large, did not echo these sentiments. Patrons knew that Disneyland was a commercial venture from the outset and were willing to pay the price as long as they received a good value in return: Disney had expected that $2 would see a child through enough of his $17 million wonderland, but mothers said twice that was needed to keep any enterprising small boy pacied. They added, as they emerged spent and spinning, that it was probably well worth it.80 Furthermore, few middle-class patrons took offense at Disney's simulations of the natural world. If anything, they enjoyed Disney's technologically informed attempts to approximate reality . In her Disneyland travelogue for the Los Angeles Times , reporter Lynn Rogers admired the seeming authenticity of the Jungle Cruise experience: \"Deadly Mau Mau natives lurked in the bushes, rhinos and hippos leered at us, elephants trumpeted and lions roared. It's pretty realistic.\"81 Some observers even went so far as to claim that Disney's depictions of nature preserved for posterity the wonders of an already disappearing natural world. In his speech commemorating Disney's \"distinguished service to conservation,\" Ludlow Griscom of the National Audubon Society said that Disney's T rue Life Adventure lms \"aroused [viewers'] desire to conserve priceless natural assets forever.\"82 American Forests writer Weldon Woodson called the Jungle Cruise \"a portrayal of the earth's fast vanishing wilderness\" that \"refreshens the spirit as it brings the voyagers close to nature in the raw .\"83 Although few patrons were quite so deferential as Woodson and Griscom, it is clear that still fewer shared the highbrow critics' disdain for Disney's synthetic portrayals of nature. How does one account for this dichotomy between popular and critical opinion? One certainly might look to the class distinctions evident in such a division; most Disneyland patrons were middle- class workers, while generally the park's most vociferous critics were highbrow literary types. Elites have a long history in America of seeking to capture nature in its wild, untamed, and \"authentic\" form and reserving it as domain for the privileged. This was particularly true of many Nineteenth Century urban elites who, freed of having to labor upon the land for their livelihoods, were at liberty to sanctify nature and set it aside as a place of recreation.84 Ever since, \"celebrating wilderness has been an activity mainly for the well-to-do city folks.\"85 Perhaps, then, Disneyland's portrayals of nature represented a threat to entrenched, elitist ideals of the wilderness. Not only did the park bring nature conveniently to the masses, prompting a kind of democratization of wilderness recreation, but it also challenged the idea that nature had to be \"real\" in order to be appreciated. Not unlike the housing developers who marketed their suburban neighborhoods as pastoral havens, Disneyland invited patrons to accept the manufactured as natural. America's middle class could now enjoy an ostensibly realistic vision of nature that was fun and fam - ily-friendly . Better yet, families could prepare themselves for Disneyland's simulated wilderness experi - ence by traveling to the park via automobile: The car allowed the family to escape the pressures of modern times: out there, on the freeway , it was still possible to play the part of the pioneer, headed bravely off into that unknown America of the presuburban past, in search of adventure and self-exploration.86 Disneyland's success rested largely on the fact that the park was easily accessible via the new Santa Ana Freeway and that it was extremely automobile-friendly . The Richeld Oil Company , for example, sponsored an ofcial Disney road map to help visitors nd their way to a gargantuan parking lot that E x p l o r a t i o n s : A n U n d e r g r a d u a t e R e s e a r c h J o u r n a l 2 0 0 4\"Disney-fying\" Mother Nature in the Atomic Era 21 could accommodate up to 12,000 cars.87 To further ensure that drivers made it to the park safe and sound, Disney released Freeway Phobia, or the Art of Driving the Superhighway in 1964. This promotional lm, in - tended to educate viewers in proper freeway etiquette, stars Goofy as each of three archetypal bad drivers (Neglecterus maximus , for instance, fails to take his driving responsibility seriously by reading, drinking coffee, and even shaving on the road).88 While the lm is humorous, its message underscores the impor - tance of the freeway to Disney's success. In short, Disney did well to cater to yet another hallmark of the Cold War era: the family road trip. In an interesting twist on the formula, then, Disneyland provided for middle-class families the same kind of natural ideal that elites had so jealously guarded in the past. Although the audio-animatronic elephants of Jungle Cruise could hardly compare to those the affluent could encounter on a real safari, middle-class suburbanites could embrace Disneyland's idealized, pristine images of nature with a similar feeling of privilege and escape. Furthermore, the palpable sense, perpetuated by Walt Disney himself, that Disneyland was somehow more real than the urban-industrial society lying outside its doorstep paralleled elitist ideas about returning to nature to discover one's \"true self.\" Such a \"homecoming\" was achieved through the requisite journey , or trek, to the wilderness, and nearly all the possible modes of transportation-train, mule, steamboat, stagecoach, and automobile-are integrated into Disneyland's for - mat. Thus, even though critics in the 1950s lambasted Disneyland for its fundamental fakeness, many of the attractions they criticized perpetuated the same ideas about nature that they themselves held so dear. Their protests were perhaps the most revealing sign that nature as refuge was no longer constricted by traditional notions of authenticity . Conclusion Coming to terms with Disneyland's success in the post-war era requires understanding the political, cultural, and social factors that influenced the lives of its patrons. Young families enjoyed Disneyland because it was tailored specically to them; every aspect of the park's construction, from the landscap - ing to the attractions, catered to prevailing cultural ideas about childhood and the home. This is not to presume, however, that all post-war families uniformly endorsed or observed such ideas. Cold War pro - paganda may have portrayed the average nuclear family as the picture of homogenization and felicity , but the reality was much more complicated. Home meant different things to different people, and certainly no two families shared identical opinions about the related issues of commercialism, child-rearing, and Cold War politics. Still, Disneyland's success was nothing if not proof that most middle-class families at least paid lip service to the highly politicized ideal of domesticity and saw Disneyland as a representative of the most reassuring and enjoyable aspects of that ideal. In using nature as a framework through which to examine this historical issue, I have sought not only to clarify the reasons for the park's popularity in the decade prior to Walt Disney's death, but also to illuminate middle-class perceptions of the natural world in a specically Cold War context. Disneyland's nature attractions, in tandem with Disney's feature lms and television programs, were key to promot - ing the park for its safe, family-friendly atmosphere devoid of the usual foibles and uncertainties of an urban-industrial, post-nuclear society . Furthermore, they represented a means to inculcate in the Baby Boomer generation an appreciation for the American wilderness and a sense of national pride. Finally , they encouraged patrons to think anthropomorphically about nature and to draw comfort from perceived similarities between the human and animal worlds. Disney's natural treatments were, therefore, much more influential than one might originally suppose, and, indeed, a major factor in Disneyland's success.Angela Hawk E x p l o r a t i o n s : A n U n d e r g r a d u a t e R e s e a r c h J o u r n a l 2 0 0 422 Notes 1.

The vector that transferred the OTC cDNA into Gelsinger's liver mimicked the human adenovirus type 5 (1). Even with critical adenoviral disease-causing regions deleted (E1 and E5), the virus still proved troublesome. Gelsinger experienced a systemic inflammatory response and multiple organ failures that left him comatose two days before he died (2). Three years later, two boys treated with therapy for X-linked severe combined immune deciency (SCID), the \"bubble boy\" disease, devel - oped leukemia (3). The delivered DNA integrated into the host LMO2 gene, which naturally plays a role with cell division. Leukemia developed because over-stimulated mitotic events caused extra-proliferated white blood cell growth. Cases such as these in which gene therapy has turned fatal show that technol - ogy has not proven to be safe enough for human trials\u2014and therefore, better techniques in gene therapy must be developed and mastered. The FDA has approved approximately 300 gene therapy experiments since 1990 (3). Current re - search on the human articial chromosome (HAC) has shown that HAC therapy avoids the problems associated with older gene therapy techniques. As its own chromosome, \"cousin 47\" does not present naked DNA that could randomly integrate into the host genome. Instead, it promotes its own replication and transcription using the host's cellular mechanics (4). Ikeno et al showed that human cultured cells transfected with HACs remain mitotically stable after many cell divisions. Ikeno's experiments indicate that 95 percent of HACs survived after 30 days without selection. Chromosome loss per day was only 0.2 percent (5). Even after 60 days, 90 percent of cells still had their HACs, showing good kinetochore estab - lishment (6). HACs do not interrupt normal cellular functioning, and, along with their mitotic stability , they have the ability to help overcome genetic predispositions. Although articial chromosomes are capable of using much more DNA than just cDNA (DNA re - verse transcribed from mRNA exons)\u2014current gene therapy is forced to use cDNA because of its con - densed size. Larin and Mejia used the entire genomic sequence from the hypoxanthine phosphoribo - syltransferase I (HPRT1) gene. While engineering the whole HPRT1 gene into a HAC, Larin and Mejia also included necessary regulatory elements: DNA insulators, promoter and enhancer regions, and locus control regions (7). All these mechanisms help control transgene expression. Grimes et al engineered human cultured HT1080 cells, deleting the HPRT1 gene, which in humans can mutate and cause Lesch-Talia Mota E x p l o r a t i o n s : A n U n d e r g r a d u a t e R e s e a r c h J o u r n a l 2 0 0 430 Nyham syndrome (a self-mutilating disease). After creating their HAC with HPRT1 DNA, they transfect - ed HT1080 cells. A Northern blot showed the fully expressive HPRT1 message. The HAC containing the HPRT1 gene complemented the deciency previously engineered in the HT1080 cells (6). Grimes and Larin have both shown that, for the HPRT1 gene, HACs can replace or introduce gene function. Ikeno et al created a HAC expressing the guano - sine triphosphate cyclohydrolase I Such hereditary dopa-responsive dystonia, or Segawa's syndrome, and Parkinsonism (5). Again, the HAC balanced the deciency within cultured cells. Dr. Larin is developing a HAC with the type VII collagen gene (COL7A1). This inherited mutation characterizes epidermolysis bullosa, causing extremely fragile skin where ngers fuse together. With more research, more genes are becoming acceptable for HAC technologies. Human chromosomes have components im - portant for mitotic stability: the centromere and the telomere (Fig. 1) (9). Centromeres are necessary for spindle attachment at pole migration during anaphase. Without a centromere, the chromosome would degrade when the cell divides. The major component of human centromeres is alpha-satellite DNA, also known as al - phoid DNA (7). Alphoid DNA constitutes 2- to 5-per - cent of the genome. It forms 171-bp arrays, which or - ganize into monomeric, dimeric, or pentameric repeat families, and more, higher order repeats. Alphoid DNA is heterogeneous within the human population (10). Telomeres cap chromosome ends with TTAGGG tandem repeats that range from 5 to 20 kb. With replication they stabilize the ends and protect against chromosomal fusion and DNA loss (11). HACs are created in two different ways. The less popular \"bottom-up\" approach includes de novo chromosome formation, where alphoid and telomeric DNA are put together (Fig. 2). Harrington et at. combined cloned alphoid and telomeric DNA arrays and co-transfected HT1080 cells with the mix - ture. The resulting chromosomes showed mitotic and cytogenetic stability , with CENP proteins inter - acting with the de novo centromeres. These articial chromsomes lasted six months in culture (12). Uncontrolled chromosome formation within the cell, however, can cause problems if the transgene is not stable inside the articial chromosome and integrates itself into the host genome (4). \"Top-down\" construction uses a different strategy (Fig. 2). An already existing chromosome is trun - cated around the centromere in situ. Telomeric sequences introduced at truncation sites can shorten the chromosome (4). For example Heller et al used telomeric DNA and fragmented the human Y chromo - some's long arm. Homologous recombination helped the telomeric DNA truncate the arm and attach itself after the Y alphoid DNA interval (7). Minichromosomes were produced in this way , via a procedure developed in 1991 called telomere-associated chromosome fragmentation (TACF). Farr et al and Heller et al created human X and Y minichromosomes as small as 0.5 Mb. For stable chromosomal function, the HAC needs a minimum of 100 kb of alphoid DNA. At rst, TACF minichromosomes were created using human cells or hybrid lines from hamster-human somatic cells (7). For more efcient \"chromo - some shuttling,\" Dieken et al used cells from a chicken pre-B-cell line, DT 40, which provided better homologous recombination (13). When creating their HAC, Larin et al used a 162 kb fragment from Xq Figure 1. Functional human articial chromosome (arrow). Normal chromosomes range from ~50 to ~230 Mb. Articial chromosomes range from 2 to 6 Mb (8).

Stability lasted for months and loss rates per day were as low as 0.0049, showing 98 percent accurate HAC mitotic activity (7). Even when these promising HAC technologies become fully ca - pable and safely make up for inherited animal deciencies, targeting the correct cells proves a major obstacle. Gelsinger received a gene therapy dosage containing 38 trillion virus particles, yet only one per - cent reached the targeted cells. The other 17 participants also did not show signicant gene expression (1). Current techniques include li - posome-mediated transfer, the targeting of specic cell receptors, and adenoviral-mediated delivery (7). The latter caused Gelsinger's death. The rst two show success, but HAC construct transfection efciencies lurk between 0.0000001 and 0.00001, showing just how much need there is for improvement (7). Germline gene therapy would guarantee that a transgene reaches specied target cells. Introducing a HAC into the six- to eight-celled blastocyst in vitro means the gene would penetrate all future adult cells. Therapy can potentially step further than just treatment for dis - ease. Using in vitro fertilization (IVF), available testing can conclude whether an embryo carries a predisposition to a particular disease (14). Embryo selection can therefore allow a couple to choose to implant only the healthy one(s). A HAC can change the embryo's genetics, but because genetic disease can be prevented, HAC technologies intro - duced to the germline would most likely be used beyond their medical applications; a HAC might have advantages that humans can not now foresee. While this futuristic scenario seems far away , \"potential hu - man germline interventions might become feasible in a time frame that is meaningful to us and our children\" (14). Future HAC use could also protect us against pathogens. With AIDS, a natural mutation confers resistance to HIV in one percent of northern-European Caucasians. HIV uses CD4 and coreceptor CCR5 to penetrate white blood cells. A 32 bp deletion in the CCR5 gene does not harm the individual at all, and blocks HIV from entering the cell (15). Chemokine receptor CCR5 is a G protein-coupled receptor involved mainly with trafcking for inflammatory processes. CCR5's seven trans-membrane domain makes three extra cellular loops. Individuals with the deletion only display one loop, and HIV cannot bind (16). This system, however, affects macrophages. Once HIV establishes itself, it can switch tropism and kill T-cells, causing AIDS (15). Although patients with the CCR5 deletion have not progressed to AIDS, they do not show 100 percent resistance (15). If a natural mutation arose also for CXCR4\u2014the coreceptor HIV uses for T-cell infection\u2014then a promising advantage would be offered by efciently inducing mutations in both receptors. For example, an engineered HAC could turn off CCR5 and CXCR4 promoters and the new mutations would inhibit HIV entry . Thus, a HAC engineered into embryos could make the individual immune to AIDS. Parents would naturally want this therapy for their children, especially if HIV were one day to mutate into a bacterial vector, perhaps from bioterrorism. While the articial chromosome will benet the individual, future progeny must also be considered. \"Cousin 47\" causes a problem with fertilization. If the individual with the HAC is a man, his wife may or may not contain an extra chromosome, especially in technology's early stages. When their gametes Figure 2. \"Bottom up\" (creating de novo chromosomes) and \"Top Down\" (truncating Telomere gene Truncate chromosome in situTalia Mota E x p l o r a t i o n s : A n U n d e r g r a d u a t e R e s e a r c h J o u r n a l 2 0 0 432 form, the unequal chromosome number could suppress fertilization. Mario R. Capecchi recognized that deleting transgenic information from the gametes would make such technologies reversible. The Cre/ loxP system allows recombination events. A gene of interest, for example in a mouse, can be flanked by loxP sites in vitro, while Cre recombinase is also engineered into the mouse. When triggered by specic chemical signals, the Cre cuts out everything between the loxP sites (leaving one loxP in place), cutting out the gene of interest. Using the Cre/loxP recombinase system, Capecchi successfully cut out changes he made to a transgenic mouse, only in gametic cells (17). A mouse gene, tACE, makes a murine an - giotensin-converting enzyme, and only becomes transcriptionally active during spermatogenesis. After placing the Cre gene with a neomycin resistance selectable marker after the tACE, Bunting et al flanked the region with loxP sites. Initiating the tACE effectively excised the region, leaving only one loxP site among the progeny DNA (17). With HACs, such loxP sites could flank the centromere. As already men - tioned, without the centromere the chromosome is lost during mitosis and meiosis. Capecchi showed that this system can be time and tissue specic (14). Cre/loxP provides a deletion mechanism for the HAC when and where the extra chromosome is no longer needed. In humans, the inability to reverse a genetically engineered extra has been a major ethical issue, but this system holds the promise of being able to delete any added information. Jesse Gelsinger was under the impression that he would have only flu-like side effects, and, because Dr. James Wilson told him his participation could help 12 million people worldwide, he was eager to join the OTC gene therapy study . However, Gelsinger fell into a coma because his ammonia level was 393 micromoles per deciliter, 10 times the normal reading. His lungs failed and even with 100 percent oxy - gen they were not able to penetrate his blood cells. By the time his father, Paul, was allowed to see him, he described Jesse as bloated beyond recognition. Dr. Wilson failed to mention that he knew Gelsinger's dosage of adenoviral particles could put him at great risk for liver failure (18). Jesse Gelsinger was sacriced for gene therapy . Similar concerns will surround human articial chromosomes even after they prove safe and efcient for human trial. This new type of gene therapy , however, will avoid the problems associated with the current techniques. The HAC will not cause a viral inflammatory response like the adenovirus did in Gelsinger. The DNA, recognized by the immune sys - tem as human, will avoid killer T-cell attack, allowing more transgene expression (14). HACs use host cellular transcription mechanisms; thus, their transgenes will not incorporate into the host genome and will not interrupt sequences important for normal cellular function. While HAC might be put to use beyond simply therapeutic treatments, its use may make it possible not only to prevent future disease, but also to provide benets based on individuals' choices. Ethicists will no doubt have a eld day over the situation, but if HACs gain acceptance for germline use, humans begin to seize control of our own evolution. Raising an important question, Gregory Stock, Director of Medicine, Technology and Society at UCLA 's School of Medicine asks, \"To what extent will we transform ourselves?\" (14) References: 1.

Regan Clark Abstract Research has revealed a positive correlation between IQ and education, as well as a negative correlation between education and religiosity. However , there is little research linking IQ with religiosity and spirituality. Further - more, researchers disagree about the operational denitions of religiousness and spirituality and about their relationship to one another . T o probe the link among religiousness, spirituality, and IQ, I had participants complete the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale Third Edition (WAIS-III), the Spiri - tual T ranscendence Scale (STS), and a questionnaire that asked about their religious background and behavior , academic achievement, and SAT scores. Religious belief and behavior were negatively related to self-reported quan - titative SAT (QSAT) scores. Moreover , prayer fulllment (one of the STS subscales) correlated negatively with father's education, and with self-re - ported scores on the Verbal SAT , QSAT , and Verbal IQ as measured by WAIS- III. In a regression analysis involving these predictors, only QSAT (which was related to father's education) was uniquely related to prayer fulllment. The results suggest that an educated father influences his offspring's cogni - tive ability, which in turn reduces certain aspects of religiosity and spiritu - ality. The results also suggest that the relationship between religiousness and spirituality is one of degree: both religious and spiritual individuals performed activities formally conceptualized as either \"religious\" or \"spiri - tual,\" but religious individuals more frequently performed such activities. Introduction Famous intellectuals have persistently disparaged religious beliefs. Marx (1844/2001) called reli - gion \"the opium of the people,\" meaning that religion is a trick perpetrated by economic elites on the struggling masses to keep them from rebelling against the social order (p. 15). Freud (1927/1962), in his provocatively titled book, The Future of an Illusion , argued that religion is a reflection of immature men -Regan Clark E x p l o r a t i o n s : A n U n d e r g r a d u a t e R e s e a r c h J o u r n a l 2 0 0 436 tal representations of father, viewed as a large, imposing, potentially violent personage without whose protection and good graces poor mortals would be intolerably vulnerable. In contemporary \"terror man - agement theory\" (Pyszczynski, Greenberg, & Solomon, 1997), religion is portrayed as a security blanket that people wrap around themselves at all ages to guard against full recognition of human mortality and meaninglessness. Steven Weinberg, the world-renowned physicist, went so far as to say during his accep - tance speech for the Nobel Prize, \"Religion is an insult to human dignity . Religion is complete nonsense and terribly damaging to human civilization\" (quoted in Freethought T oday , 2000). These views have permeated intellectual discussions for over a hundred years, yet religious and spiritual beliefs remain extremely prevalent in the American population. A recent Gallup poll (1996) in the United States revealed that 96% of adults believe in God or a higher being, 90% believe in life after death, 87% say religion plays a very important role in their lives, and 90% pray (Hill, Pargament, Hood, McCullough, Swyers, Larson, & Zinnbauer, 2000), statistics that are comparable to those found in other sources (e.g., Shermer, 2000; Karren, Hafen, Smith, & Frandsen, 2002). At every point in the lifespan, religious and spiritual beliefs hold meaning to most Americans (Hill et al., 2000). Even most college un - dergraduates, who are widely thought to distance themselves from their childhood religious and spiritual beliefs (Feldman, 1969; McLennan, 1999), believe that one God created the universe and reigns supreme over it. There is no evidence that college students are more likely than older adults to be atheists (Greeley , 2002). The prevalence of religious belief and behavior in America would presumably be astonishing to intellectual skeptics like Marx and Freud who viewed religion as misleading and largely damaging to hu - mans. They would probably be even more shocked to learn that researchers have consistently linked reli - gious beliefs and behavior to mental and physical health and personal well-being. Emmons (1999b), for example, found that religiosity is an important predictor of existential well-being, happiness, and general life satisfaction. Gartner (1991) showed that \"the religiously faithful have lower suicide rates, lower drug use and abuse, less juvenile delinquency , lower divorce rates, higher marital happiness, better overall well-being, and better recovery from mental illness\" (cited in Karren et al., 2002, p. 458). Religious belief correlates with received social support, healthy behaviors, and an increased sense of self-coherence and meaning in life (George, Larson, Koenig, & McCullough, 2000). Emmons (1999b) argued, \"Religions, as authoritative faith traditions, are systems of information that provide individuals with knowledge and resources for living a life of purpose and direction\" (p. 879). Additionally , religion and spiritual beliefs contribute to the ability to cope effectively with illness, dis - ability , and negative life events (Pargament, 1997), as does prayer (Poloma & Pendleton, 1989). A study of the religiosity and well-being of patients in a geriatric clinic found that those who were not religiously active had much higher rates of alcohol and tobacco use, depression, anxiety , and cancer than those who were very religiously active, who subsequently enjoyed \"better overall physical and mental health\" (Karren et al., 2002, p. 444). Religious and spiritual beliefs also contribute to health by positively impos - ing norms on sexual, diet, and health-care behaviors (Levin & Vanderpool, 1992). Religious and spiritual beliefs are also important in organizing human perceptions and cognitions. Emmons (1999b) noted that a spiritual sense is fundamental to \"self-concept, identity , and relationship to God and others\" (p. 875). Religiousness, Spirituality, and IQ Only a few researchers have studied religiousness and spirituality as they relate to intelligence. More often, the research is more indirect, such as Shermer's (2000) study of religiosity and education, which found a slightly negative correlation between religiosity and education. If there is a signicant positive correlation ( r = .63) between intelligence and years of education (Mantarazzo & Herman, 1984; Rowe, Vesterdal, & Rodgers, 1998), then what is the link between intelligence and religiosity? Research by E x p l o r a t i o n s : A n U n d e r g r a d u a t e R e s e a r c h J o u r n a l 2 0 0 4Religiousness, Spirituality, and IQ: Are They Linked? 37 Cacioppo and Petty (1982) revealed a slightly negative correlation between ACT scores and dogmatism, but dogmatism is not a very strong correlate of religious belief. Along the same lines, Simon and Ward (1975) found a negative correlation between intelligence and religious belief. Unfortunately , these stud - ies measured intelligence in terms of self-reported ACT scores or the Raven Progressive Matrices test, instruments that are not widely-used indicators of IQ or general intelligence. Without studies based on valid measures of intelligence, such as the WAIS-III (Wechsler, 1997), it is impossible to be certain whether acceptance of religious and spiritual tenets is negatively related to general intelligence. It is also important to carefully dene and operationalize religiousness and spirituality , something previous studies have often failed to do. RELIGIOUSNESS AND SPIRITUALITY After considering many diverse denitions of religion and spirituality , Emmons (1999a) dened the religious and the spiritual as \"that realm of life which is concerned with ultimate purpose and meaning in life, a set of principles and ethics to live by , commitment to God or a higher power, a recognition of the transcendent in everyday experience, a selfless focus, and a set of beliefs and practices that is designed to facilitate a relationship with the transcendent\" (p. 92). Although most researchers support this broad denition of religiousness and spirituality , there is little agreement about the distinction between the two constructs (Zinnbauer, Pargament, & Scott, 1999). According to Piedmont (1997), religiousness concerns the social and organizational aspects of relations with the divine, whereas spiritual transcen - dence, his term for spirituality , is a \"personal search for connection with a larger sacredness\" (p. 989). A spiritual search is an attempt to identify exactly what is sacred and what is worthy of committing oneself to (Emmons, 1999a). It is difcult to tell from the various conceptual discussions of religiousness and spirituality how similar and/or different the two states are. In a study by Zinnbauer and Pargament (1998), 42% of respondents, a plurality , identied religious - ness and spirituality as somewhat distinct while also sharing overlapping features, like two partially overlapping circles in a Venn diagram. The researchers did not, however, specify precisely what beliefs and behaviors are shared by and distinct to religiousness and spirituality . THE CURRENT STUDY Because previous studies of intelligence and religiosity have not been based on an optimal measure of IQ and have not distinguished clearly between religiosity and spirituality , I undertook a new study using better measures. I used the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Third Edition (WAIS-III; Wechsler, 1997), which is widely recognized as one of the best designed and standardized measures of IQ. The WAIS-III combines scores on tests of verbal concept formation, short-term and long-term memory , atten - tion, visual-motor ability , perceptual organization, psychomotor speed, and pattern recognition to yield three scores: Verbal IQ (VIQ), Performance IQ (PIQ), and Full Scale IQ (FSIQ). I operationalized spirituality with the Spiritual Transcendence Scale (STS; Piedmont, 1999). According to Piedmont, spiritual transcendence is a \"personal search for connection with a larger sacred - ness\" (p. 989), whereas religiousness concerns the social and organizational aspects of relations with the divine. Spiritual transcendence as measured by the STS comprises connectedness (the belief that one is an important link in the chain of humanity), universality (belief in the unity of all life), and prayer fulllment (the joy and contentment that arise from communion with \"a transcendent reality\"). I measured religiousness, as distinct from spirituality , in terms of religious background, self-clas - sication, and behavior. I asked study participants about the involvement of their family and friends in religious activities; their family's degree of religiosity; the number of years, if any , spent in a religiously afliated school; and personal involvement in religious activities, such as attending church, praying, and Regan Clark E x p l o r a t i o n s : A n U n d e r g r a d u a t e R e s e a r c h J o u r n a l 2 0 0 438 reading religious literature. I also asked participants whether they were religious, spiritual, atheistic, or agnostic, and with what if any religion they most closely identied. Participants also answered back - ground questions about their age, parents' levels of education, SAT scores, and academic achievement (high school, last college quarter, and college cumulative grade point average, or GPA). Past research suggests that correlating IQ with spirituality and religiosity will yield signicant nega - tive associations. I hypothesized that, using a valid measure of IQ, the current study will support this nding. By differentiating between religiousness and spirituality , the current study should also clarify whether the negative correlation between IQ or education and religiosity exists for spirituality as well, and help researchers distinguish between these constructs in future studies. Method PARTICIPANTS Seventy-seven University of California, Davis, undergraduate students (60 women, 17 men), who were recruited for extra credit in introductory Psychology classes, participated in this study . When asked their ethnicity , 22 identied themselves as Asian or Asian American, 34 identied themselves as Caucasian, and the other 21 identied themselves as African American, Latino, Mixed, or Other. Their ages ranged from 17 to 24 years, with a mean of 19.40 years. The level of education of their fathers ( M = 2.72, where 2 indicates some college and 3 indicates completing a college degree) was signicantly high - er than their mothers' level of education ( M = 2.36, using the same scale) [ t(74) = 2.87, p < .01]. (Here and elsewhere in this paper, N's that differ from 77-the numbers of participants-reflect missing data on some variables). The mean GPA of the participants in their major was 3.02 (a B average). Their mean self- reported Quantitative SAT (QSAT) score was 594.43 and their mean Verbal SAT (VSAT) score was 569.86, scores that are both above the national average (roughly 500). Their mean Verbal and Performance IQs (116.95 and 115.23, respectively) reached well into the High Average range of cognitive ability . Forty-eight percent said they are religious (they believed in God and a structured form of religion, such as Christianity , Hinduism, Islam, or Judaism); 25% classied themselves as spiritual (they did not en - dorse a structured form of religion but believed in the existence of a higher power); 20% called themselves agnostic; and only 8% were atheists. Most respondents were Catholic (22%), Protestant (20%), Buddhist (13%), Jewish (8%), or placed themselves in the \"Other\" category (38%); however, those who identied themselves as Other were still likely to call themselves religious rather than agnostic or atheist. MEASURES As mentioned earlier, the WAIS-III was used to measure IQ. Its high reliability and validity have been documented by numerous researchers (Wechsler, 1997). A background questionnaire was used to assess age, self-reported SAT Math and Verbal scores, major GPA, and parental levels of education. A re - ligious background questionnaire designed especially for this study was used to assess each participant's religion, relationship to God, religious behavior, family religiousness, and religious schooling. The STS (Piedmont, 1999) was used to measure spirituality . PROCEDURE First, each participant was given the WAIS-III, which was individually administered by a trained examiner. Participants took an abbreviated form of the WAIS-III. Research has demonstrated that ab - breviating the WAIS-III does not signicantly compromise scores (Wymer, Rayls, & Wagner, 2003); therefore, due to time constraints, participants were given only the Picture Completion, Vocabulary , Digit-Symbol-Coding, Similarities, Block Design, Arithmetic, Matrix Reasoning, Digit Span, and Information sub-tests (but not the Comprehension and Picture Arrangement sub-tests). Participants' E x p l o r a t i o n s : A n U n d e r g r a d u a t e R e s e a r c h J o u r n a l 2 0 0 4Religiousness, Spirituality, and IQ: Are They Linked? 39 scores on sub-tests within the performance and verbal domains, respectively , were averaged to estimate the scores they would have obtained on the Comprehension and Picture Arrangement sub-tests, and then overall VIQ and PIQ scores were computed. The administration and scoring procedures were the ones described in the WAIS-III Administration and Scoring Manual (Wechsler, 1997), including the derivation of the FSIQ. In addition to being tested for intelligence, each participant completed a computer-based series of short questionnaires: a demographics questionnaire, a religious background questionnaire, and the STS. When a participant had successfully completed the questionnaires, he or she was thanked, pro - vided with answers to any questions, and excused from the experiment. Each experimental session lasted between 35 and 60 minutes. Results All data analyses were computed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (2001; release 11.0). The descriptive statistics for all variables are shown in Table 1 (see Appendix). RELIGIOUSNESS, SPIRITUALITY, AND INTELLIGENCE To assess the degree of association between pairs of continuous variables, I computed Pearson cor - relation coefcients. The results are displayed in Table 2. I wanted to explore the association between Relationship to God (whether someone identied him- or herself as religious, spiritual, agnostic, or atheist) and SAT scores. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) comparing the QSAT scores of participants in the four different relationship-to-God categories was signicant ( F(3,66) = 3.74, p < .02). A Bonferroni post hoc comparison of means indicated that the signicant difference was due primarily to religious in - dividuals having lower QSAT scores than atheists. In order to see whether there was a similarly negative correlation between QSAT scores and the frequency of religious behavior, I combined the religious be - havior items (frequency of reading sacred texts and other religious literature, attending religious services, and praying) to form an internally consistent religious behavior scale (Cronbach's alpha = .81). This scale was negatively correlated with QSAT ( r = -.31, p < negative correlations emerged between Prayer Fulllment (a sub-scale of the STS mea - suring \"the joy and contentment that arise from communion with a transcendent reality\") and self-re - ported Verbal SAT, self-reported Quantitative SAT, and Verbal IQ as measured by the WAIS-III ( rs = -.25, -.30, -.27; all ps < .05). When these correlates of Prayer Fulllment, all of which were also correlated with each other ( rs ranged from .25 to .62, all ps < .05), were entered into a regression analysis to predict Prayer Fulllment, only self-reported QSAT (\u00df = -.24, p = .054) made a signicant unique contribution, although all three beta coefcients were negative. Because QSAT was also related to father's education level, I wanted to see if father's education was negatively related to the offspring's prayer fulllment. Additional analysis, not planned a priori, revealed a signicant negative correlation ( r = -.24, p < .05); however, when I tried to predict prayer fulllment in a regression analysis from father's education level and participant's quantitative SAT score, the signicant association between father's education and offspring's prayer fulllment became insignicant. The only remaining signicant predictor of prayer fulllment was the participant's QSAT score. Connectedness, another subscale of the STS that measures the belief that one is an important part of humanity and plays an integral role in its continued harmony , was positively correlated with current GPA in one's major ( r = .29, p < .05). IQ AND SAT SCORES To evaluate the use of self-reported SAT scores as rough measures of intelligence, I ran a Pearson correlation. Verbal IQ and self-reported Verbal SAT were signicantly correlated ( r = .62, p < .05) and Regan Clark E x p l o r a t i o n s : A n U n d e r g r a d u a t e R e s e a r c h J o u r n a l 2 0 0 440 Performance IQ and Quantitative SAT were signicantly correlated ( r = .34, p < .05), suggesting that people's remembered SAT scores were at least roughly accurate, and that the self-reported SAT scores were generally consistent with measured IQ scores. There was also a signicant positive correlation be - tween Verbal SAT scores and both parents' education levels (mother, r = .30, p < .05; father, r = .37, p < .05), but QSAT and VIQ scores were correlated only with the father's level of education ( r = .30, p < .05, r = .26, p < .05). RELIGIOUSNESS AND SPIRITUALITY Prayer Fulllment and Universality (both sub-scales of the STS, the former self-explanatory and the latter measuring the unity of all life) were positively correlated with reading religious scripture ( r = .46, p < .05, r = .53, p < .05), reading other forms of religious literature ( r = .36, p < .05, r = .28, p < .05), praying (r = .54, p < .05, r = .52, p < .05), and attending religious services on one's own ( r = .53, p < .05, r = .31, p < .05). Having friends who are involved in religious activities was correlated signicantly with Prayer Fulllment but not with Universality ( r = .28, p < .05, r = .07, ns). As mentioned earlier, these religious behavior items were combined to form an internally consistent religious behavior scale. The association between this scale and self-categorization of Relationship to God (i.e., as religious, spiritual, agnostic, or atheistic) was assessed with an analysis of variance, and the resulting F value was statistically signicant (F(3,73) = 26.72, p < .01). The results, as well as parallel ANOVAs for the com - ponents of the scale, are shown in Table 3 (Appendix). Religious individuals reported a higher degree of religious behavior than spiritual, agnostic, or atheistic individuals. In considering the effects of reli - gion-related self-categorization on the separate components of the religious behavior scale, notice that religious individuals scored higher on Prayer Fulllment than spiritual, agnostic, and atheist participants as assessed by an ANOVA. Through the use of Bonferonni's multiple comparisons, I found that religious individuals pray signicantly more than spiritual individuals, who pray more than agnostic individuals, who pray more than atheist individuals. Using this post hoc test, I also found that spiritual and religious individuals were signicantly higher in Universality than either agnostics or atheists. The results of an additional ANOVA indicated that Protestants had higher religious behavior scores than Buddhists. Participants who identied themselves as Protestant or Catholic were more likely to iden - tify themselves as religious rather than spiritual, agnostic, or atheist. Atheists were more likely than other participants to be Buddhists. Agnostics were most likely to fall into the Other category of religions. Discussion RELIGIOUSNESS, SPIRITUALITY, AND INTELLIGENCE The main purpose of the study was to determine whether religiosity is negatively related to intel - ligence, and if it is, whether the same negative relationship exists for spirituality . I also wanted to know whether a well-validated measure of intelligence, the WAIS-III, would reveal a negative relation between religiosity and intelligence. The ndings indicated that religious participants did have signicantly lower QSAT scores than members of the other three relationship-to-God categories (spiritual, agnostic, and atheist). This result suggests that religious individuals are somewhat lower in quantitative ability , perhaps suggesting less rigor in certain kinds of reasoning. This pattern did not extend to the other relationship- to-God categories, suggesting that there is something special about the people who identied themselves as religious. The pattern also did not extend to the other main measure of quantitative ability , the Performance IQ score, even though the two quantitative ability measures were signicantly correlated with each other. These results suggest that acquired quantitative ability (as measured by the QSAT) may be more negative - ly related to religiosity than inherent quantitative ability (as measured by the PIQ score). Further research E x p l o r a t i o n s : A n U n d e r g r a d u a t e R e s e a r c h J o u r n a l 2 0 0 4Religiousness, Spirituality, and IQ: Are They Linked? 41 would be needed to specify the precise kinds of incompatibility between trained quantitative reasoning and religiosity . It is interesting that father's education was signicantly related, positively , to several of the ability measures, and related negatively to prayer fulllment. This set of ndings is consistent with the possibility that educated fathers help their children learn to think rigorously , a capacity that then lowers religiosity and spirituality in certain ways. This process is worth examining in future studies. It is important to say more about what being \"religious\" means in the present context. Participants who placed themselves in the \"religious\" category were disproportionately Protestants and Catholics, rather than Jews, Buddhists, and other kinds of religious people (\"Other\"). Thus, religiosity for the people who called themselves religious seems likely to be some form of traditional Christianity . When several religious behavior items (e.g., reading religious literature, praying frequently , attending religious services) were combined to form an internally consistent religious behavior scale, the scale was negative - ly correlated with the quantitative SAT score (the same scale that related negatively to prayer fulllment and being religious, according to self-categorization). Prayer fulllment, feeling that joy and contentment have been achieved through prayer, was nega - tively related to both SAT scores and verbal IQ as assessed by the WAIS-III. In a regression equation predicting prayer fulllment from these three different indicators of intelligence, only the quantitative SAT score had a unique effect (a negative effect), suggesting that quantitative skill or something closely associated with it interferes with prayer fulllment, at least when the latter is dened by the Spiritual Transcendence Scale. Because the QSAT predicted low prayer fulllment better than performance IQ or either of the verbal measures, it seems likely that specic training in quantitative reasoning is an impor - tant factor. Because QSAT was related to father's education level, and both were related to (lower) prayer fulll - ment, I conducted a regression analysis to predict prayer fulllment from both father's education and participant's QSAT score. Only participant's QSAT score remained as a signicant predictor, suggesting again that the relation between father's education and offspring's prayer fulllment is mediated by the offspring's QSAT score. It therefore seems possible that educated fathers, who in some cases have received advanced training in science and mathematics, have an influence on their offspring in both quantitative ability , as reflected in the QSAT score, and a lower level of prayer fulllment. This correlation might mean that whatever rigorous reasoning or scientic skepticism was demonstrated by the father put the brakes on the offspring's ability to feel joyfully fullled by prayer. Connectedness, the belief that one is an important link in the chain of humanity , seemed to work very differently than prayer fulllment, even though the two variables were signicantly correlated with each other (.23). Connectedness was positively correlated with GPA in one's major but not signicantly related to any of the \"intelligence\" indicators. This nding suggests either that students perform better in college when they feel signicant, less alienated, and well connected emotionally with their family and community , or that people who succeed in school tend to feel less alienated and more socially connected because of their success. There is a large body of research supporting the rst interpretation (e.g., Lopez, Mitchell, & Gormley , 2002 ). It seems likely that this set of interconnected variables has little to do with intelligence, and in fact in the present study , perhaps surprisingly , GPA in one's major was not related signicantly to the intelligence variables. IQ AND SAT SCORES This study also validated the use of self-report SAT scores as a rough measure of IQ and helped to clarify the relationship between parental education and IQ and SAT scores. There was a signicant posi - tive correlation between Verbal SAT scores and both parents' education levels, but QSAT and VIQ scores were correlated only with the father's level of education. Although Performance IQ should be a better Regan Clark E x p l o r a t i o n s : A n U n d e r g r a d u a t e R e s e a r c h J o u r n a l 2 0 0 442 measure of quantitative intelligence than a self-reported QSAT score, the latter score proved in the pres - ent study to be a better predictor of religiosity and prayer fulllment. This correlation suggests that the negative relationship between quantitative intelligence and traditional religiosity is not necessarily due to intelligence per se, if intelligence is conceptualized mainly as an inherent ability . Rather, the negative associations among QSAT, religiosity , and prayer fulllment may be due to learned skills in reasoning, perhaps influenced in the home by the father's education level. RELIGIOUSNESS AND SPIRITUALITY This study helps to clarify the relationship between religiousness and spirituality . Individuals who identied themselves as religious prayed more, were more satised with their prayer, and engaged in more religious behavior (attending religious services, praying, and reading religious scripture and litera - ture) than their spiritual, agnostic, and atheistic counterparts. They also had higher prayer fulllment scores than those who identied themselves as spiritual. Because religious individuals' increased fre - quency of prayer was correlated with prayer fulllment, which had been considered previously as exist - ing within the spiritual sphere, it would seem better to view prayer fulllment as an aspect of religiosity rather than of spirituality . Religiosity and spirituality as measured here seem to differ in degree rather than in kind; both religious and spiritual individuals performed activities thought to be either \"religious\" or \"spiritual,\" but religious individuals did them more frequently . Moreover, along the same conceptual continuum, agnostics performed these behaviors less frequently than spiritual individuals, and atheists performed them least of all. Spiritual and religious participants also reported higher family religiousness than agnostic partici - pants, a result that is consistent with claims that parental religiousness is a good predictor of children's religiousness (Spilka, Hood, Hunsberger, & Gorsuch, 2003). Frequency of prayer also corresponded to the level of reported religiousness within the family , a relationship that suggests that certain religious behaviors, such as prayer, are learned rst in the home and are then generally continued while attend - ing college. This pattern may occur even after offspring categorize themselves as spiritual rather than religious, a move that they probably interpret as moving away from their parents' form of religion. This speculation-that spirituality is often a step away from a traditional form of religiosity associated with parents' beliefs and commitments-deservers further study . LIMITATIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH Unfortunately , characteristics of my sample may limit generalization of the ndings. One such char - acteristic is gender. The study consisted primarily of women, who are universally more religious than men (Stark, 2003). The mean IQ of the population is also an area of concern. Mean IQ scores for both men and women in this study reached well into the high-average range of cognitive ability (the general population mean is 100). The ndings might be somewhat different, or even stronger, if a wider range of intellectual ability were sampled. Religious self-identication by the participants may also limit generalization. Forty-eight percent of the participants declared themselves as religious, twenty-ve percent as spiritual, twenty percent as ag - nostic, and eight percent as atheists. This distribution differs from that found in the United States popula - tion, which does not have as many atheists or agnostics (Shermer, 2000). The representation of religions in the current study was similarly skewed; most respondents were Protestant or Catholic. Social desirability bias also poses a threat to the validity of this study . Past research has shown that studies regarding religion and spirituality elicit concern in a participant for what others would think about his or her answers, thus prompting people to answer in more socially desirable ways (Spilka et al., E x p l o r a t i o n s : A n U n d e r g r a d u a t e R e s e a r c h J o u r n a l 2 0 0 4Religiousness, Spirituality, and IQ: Are They Linked? 43 2003). Though condentiality was ensured for each participant, the mere presence of the examiner could have elicited a social desirability bias. Reliability of the measures was satisfactory in this study , but validity is a more problematic issue. The Spiritual Transcendence Scale, the WAIS-III, and the religiousness measure are just a few of many available measures of the constructs under consideration here. Though they are reliable, they may not be testing exactly what they are meant to test, so future researchers should attempt to develop even clearer denitions and more valid measures.

Java servlets, for example, can create string representations of SQL queries and then, using JDBC, send the que - ries to a database server for execution. The servlet programmer enjoys static checking via Java's strong type system. However , the Java type system does little to check for possible errors in the dynamically generated SQL query strings. Thus, a type error in a generated selection query (e.g., comparing a string attribute with an integer) can result in an SQL runtime exception. Currently, such defects must be rooted out through careful testing; worse yet, if they are not, the customer might discover them at runtime. In this paper , a sound, static, program analysis technique to verify the correctness of dy - namically generated query strings is presented. The analysis technique will be described, and soundness results for the static analysis algorithm will be provided. The paper also describes the details of a prototype tool based on the algorithm, and includes several illustrative defects found in senior software-engineering student-team projects, online tutorial examples, and a real world purchase order system written by the author . Introduction Data-intensive applications often dynamically construct database query strings and execute them. For example, a typical Java servlet web service constructs SQL query strings and dispatches them over a JDBC connector to an SQL-compliant database. In this example scenario, the Java servlet program generates and manipulates SQL queries as string data. Here, I refer to Java as the meta-language used to manipulate object-language programs in SQL. I use a concrete example throughout the paper to explain my analysis technique.Carl Gould E x p l o r a t i o n s : A n U n d e r g r a d u a t e R e s e a r c h J o u r n a l 2 0 0 448 Consider a front-end Java servlet for a grocery store, with an SQL-driven database back-end. The database has a table INVENTORY , containing a list of all items in the store. This table includes three columns, among others: RETAIL , WHOLESALE , and TYPE . The RETAIL and WHOLESALE columns are both of type integer, indicating their respective costs in cents. The TYPE column is an integer, rep - resenting the product type-codes of the items in the table. In the grocery store database, there is another table, TYPES , used to look up type-codes. This table contains the columns TYPECODE , TYPEDESC , and NAME , which, respectively , are of the types integer, varchar (a string), and varchar. The following example code fragment illustrates some common errors that programmers might make when programming Java servlet applications: ResultSet getPerishablePrices(String FROM INVENTORY \" + if (lowerBound != null) { query += \"WHOLESALE > \" + lowerBound + \" AND \"; } query += \"TYPE IN (\" + getPerishableTypeCode()+ getPerishableTypeCode() { return \"SELECT TYPEDESC FROM TYPES \" + \"WHERE NAME = 'sh' OR NAME = 'meat'\"; } The method getPerishablePrices constructs the string query to hold an SQL SELECT statement to return the prices of all the perishable items, and executes the query . It uses the string re - turned by the method getPerishableTypeCode as a sub-query . In the code, is the concatenation operator, and the clause TYPE IN (...) checks whether the type-code TYPE matches any of the type- codes of the perishable items. If lowerBound is \"595,\" for example, then the query to be executed is: SELECT '$'||(RETAIL/100) FROM INVENTORY WHERE WHOLESALE > 595 AND TYPE IN (SELECT TYPECODE, TYPEDESC FROM TYPES WHERE NAME = 'sh' OR NAME = 'meat'); Several different runtime errors can arise with this example. I list them below . Note that none of these would be caught by Java's type system: Error (1). The expression $ ||(RETAIL/100) concatenates the character $ with the re - sult of the numeric expression RETAIL/100 . While some database systems will implicitly type-cast the numeric result to a string, many do not, and will issue a runtime error. Error (2). Consider the expression WHOLESALE > lowerBound . The variable lowerBound is declared as a string, and the WHOLESALE column is of type integer. As long as lowerBound is in- deed a string representing a number, there are no type errors. However, this is risky: nothing (certainly not the Java type system itself) keeps the string variable lowerBound from containing non-numeric characters. Error (3). The string returned by the method get-PerishableTypeCode() constitutes a sub-E x p l o r a t i o n s : A n U n d e r g r a d u a t e R e s e a r c h J o u r n a l 2 0 0 4Static Checking of Dynamically Generated Queries in Database Applications 49 query that selects two columns from the table TYPES . Because the IN clause of SQL supports only sub-queries returning a single column (in this context), a runtime error would arise. This can happen if the method getPerishableType -Code() did return a single column before, but was inadvertently changed to return two columns. This specic combination of Java as the meta-language and SQL as the object-language is widely used today . The databases receiving these constructed SQL queries certainly perform syntax and semantic checking of the queries. But because these queries are dynamically generated, errors are only discovered at runtime. It would be desirable to catch these errors statically in the source code. In this paper, I present a static analysis to flag potential errors or guarantee their absence in dynami - cally generated SQL queries. My approach is based on a combination of automata-theoretic techniques [9], and a variant of the context-free language (CFL) reachability problem [14, 15]. As a rst step, my analysis builds upon a static string analysis to build a conservative representation of the generated query strings as a nite-state automaton. Then, I statically check the nite-state automa - ton with a modied version of the context-free language reachability algorithm. My analysis is sound in the sense that if it does not nd any errors, then such errors do not occur at runtime. I have implemented the analysis and tested the tool on realistic programs using JDBC, including senior software-engineering student-team projects, online tutorial examples, and a real-world purchase order system. The tool is able to detect some known and some unknown errors in these programs. Although it has not been tuned for performance, it runs its operations in only a few minutes on all test programs. Furthermore, the analysis empirically appears quite precise, with a low false-positive error rate. The rest of the paper begins with background on the string analysis and context-free language reach - ability and a brief overview of my analysis. Then I present the analysis in more detail and discuss my experimental setup and results. Finally , I survey related work and conclude with a discussion of possible future work. Background and Analysis Overview STATIC STRING ANALYSIS OF JAVA PROGRAMS The analysis makes use of the string analysis of Java programs reported in [6]. Essentially , it is an interprocedural data-flow analysis [10, 12] to approximate the semantics of a program's string manipula - tion expressions. The analysis is similar to a pointer analysis [3] for imperative languages or a control- flow analysis (0-CFA) [17] for functional languages. It approximates the set of possible strings that the program might generate for a particular string variable at a particular program location of interest; these locations are called hotspots. The string analysis produces a nite state automaton (FSA) that conserva - tively approximates the set of possible strings for each hotspot specied; that is, for each hotspot, the au - tomaton accepts a larger set of strings than is actually produced by the program.. In my earlier example, the statement return statement.executeQuery(query); is a hotspot for that program. The string analysis works on Java bytecode. It starts by nding the hotspots in the Java program. I simply mark every location with a call to the method executeQuery (such as return state - ment.executeQuery(query) in my example) as a hotspot. Then the analysis abstracts away the control flow of the program, and creates a flow graph representing the possible string expressions. The graph captures the flow of strings and string operations in a program; all else is abstracted away . The nodes in a flow graph correspond to variables or expressions in the program, and the edges represent directed def-use relationships for the possible data-flow . For example, for the statement query = str1 + str2; the following graph nodes and edges are created: Carl Gould E x p l o r a t i o n s : A n U n d e r g r a d u a t e R e s e a r c h J o u r n a l 2 0 0 450 In the graph, the node labeled concat represents the concatenation expression str1 + str2 , with the edges labeled 1 and 2 being the corresponding rst and second arguments. The edge between nodes labeled concat . and query indicates the assignment. The other expressions and operators are treated similarly; full details can be found in [6]. Next, this flow graph is reduced to an extended context-free grammar2 by treating the nodes of the flow graph as terminals and non-terminals of the grammar. For example, the flow graph given earlier in this section yields the following grammar rules: C ::= S1 S2 Q ::= C where S1, S2, C, and Q correspond to the respective nodes for str1 , str2 , concat , and query . In general, the grammar generated from a flow graph is not regular (not even context-free as mentioned earlier). To make further analysis computationally tractable, I widen this grammar to a regular language. The widening step allows syntax checking of the generated strings against a grammar.3 Since the (fairly technical) details of this step are not the main focus of this work, I omit them here and refer interested readers to [6]. CONTEXTFREE LANGUAGE REACHABILITY In the next step, the FSA is processed by a context-free language (CFL) reachability algorithm, which forms the foundation of my analysis. I give a brief description of the problem and the algorithm here (cf. [14,15] for further details). The CFL-reachability problem takes as inputs a context-free gram - mar G with terminals T and non-terminals N, and a directed graph D with edges labeled with symbols from T N. Let S be the start symbol of G, and = T N. A path in the graph is called an S-path if its word is derived from the start symbol S. The CFL-reachability problem is to nd all pairs of vertices s and t such that there is an S-path between s and t. The algorithm to solve the CFL-reachability problem uses dynamic programming, and also relates to dynamic transitive closure [23],4 which underlies many standard program analysis algorithms, such as type systems based on subtyping, alias analysis, and control-flow analysis [2,3,17]. The algorithm rst normalizes the grammar G such that each production's right-hand side contains no more than two sym - bols. This is easily done by introducing new non-terminal symbols. Then new derived edges are added to D based on the productions of G. For example, suppose G has the production X ::= A B, and A contains the following edges: The algorithm adds a dotted edge: The algorithm repeatedly applies the above transformation to the graph D until no more new edges can be added. Any pair of nodes s and t with an edge labeled X in the nal graph has an X-path from s to t in A A BXB1 2E x p l o r a t i o n s : A n U n d e r g r a d u a t e R e s e a r c h J o u r n a l 2 0 0 4Static Checking of Dynamically Generated Queries in Database Applications 51 the original graph D. The running time of the algorithm is cubic in both the size of the alphabet and the size of the graph, i.e., O(3D3). I make use of CFL-reachability in two distinct phases of my analysis, as I explain next. Fig. 1. Overview of the analysis. OVERVIEW OF MY ANALYSIS Figure 1 gives an overview of my analysis. There are two main steps. In the rst step (detailed in a later section), I generate a nite state automaton to conservatively approximate the set of object-pro - grams. In the second step, I process this automaton in two sub-stages. First, I apply CFL-reachability , using SQL grammar, to nd scoping information and typing contexts. Second, I apply CFL-reachability again, using the database schema, to perform type-checking. Semantic errors, if found, are reported dur - ing both phases. Note that my analysis differs from a standard SQL type-checker, which analyzes a single query at execution time. I statically analyze a potentially innite set of queries. Fig. 2. Automaton transformation illustrated. Main Steps in Analysis AUTOMATON GENERATION AND TRANSFORMATION In the rst step, for each hotspot in the program I apply the string analysis in [6] to generate, an FSA representing the possible set of query strings that the hotspot can have. The transitions of the automaton are over single letters from the alphabet of the source language. For convenience, I perform a simple compaction on the automaton, so that all transitions are over keywords, delimiters, or literals in the ob - ject-language. Figure 2a shows a fragment of the automaton that the string analysis in [6] produces. After Java Class FilesStatic String Analysis (Sectiion 3.1)Finite AutomationType CORRECT !!TYPE ERRORS!

I then use these tokens to create an equivalent FSA with transitions over the keywords, literals, and delimiters of my object-language. In addition, white-spaces are removed from the automaton in this step. RECONSTRUCTION OF TYPE ENVIRONMENTS For an SQL query , the declared types of various columns are given in a database schema. This is similar to the notion of a type environment in standard type systems for language such as C, Java, and ML to look up types of variables. To illustrate, consider the sample SQL query SELECT NAME FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE SALARY > 20,000. The information that NAME is of type varchar, and SALARY is of type integer is not explicit in the above query expression, but is stored separately in the schema of the table EMPLOYEE . For the same reason, my generated FSA does not have this information either. I need to reconstruct it from the database schemas. I now describe how I use the CFL-reachability analysis to obtain the column-name to type mapping from the schema. In this step, I assume that the generated FSA is syntactically correct, i.e., that the query strings pro - duced by the FSA are all of valid SQL syntax. This assumption is reinforced by the string analysis [6], because it performs syntax-checking of the generated automaton. The type environment recon - struction for the FSA is non-trivial; the type of any given column de - pends upon its context, i.e., its lo - cation. Depending on the structure of the FSA, a given column may appear in any of several different contexts. For example, suppose I have the automaton shown in Figure 3. The type of the column NAME can be different depending on which of the two paths in the automaton is taken. In one path, its type is determined by the schema's denition of TABLE1 ; in the other, it is de - termined by that of TABLE2 . My solution to this problem is based on a variant of the CFL-reachability al - gorithm. I apply the algorithm with the context-free grammar for SQL queries and with the transformed automaton as inputs. In essence, I use the CFL reachability algorithm to parse the automaton. This is very similar to general context-free parsing (which is also of cubic time complexity). However, instead of parsing a particular query , I work with an automaton which produces a potentially innite number of query strings. In Table 1, I show an excerpt of the grammar I use for SQL 's SELECT statement [7]. Non-ter - minals are in italics, and terminals are in capital letters. My grammar is not yet complete, but could be easily made so by adding more rules. The CFL- reachability algorithm described in [14] requires a normalized grammar such that the right-hand side of any production has no more than two symbols. My implementation of CFL-reachability has been extended so that it works with productions with no more than three symbols on their right- hand sides. This extension allows me to use more naturally written grammars. Table 1. SQL SELECT statement grammar. Figure 3. An FSA with two table contexts.1 2 3 4 5 6SELECT NAME FROMTABLE !; TABLE 2E x p l o r a t i o n s : A n U n d e r g r a d u a t e R e s e a r c h J o u r n a l 2 0 0 4Static Checking of Dynamically Generated Queries in Database Applications 53 The modied CFL-reachability algorithm enables me to nd the type context (i.e., type environ - ment) of each path through the automaton. I can then use this information to match every column with all of its possible types. The type contexts are discovered by annotating the automaton with the deriva - tion in use while running the CFL-reachability algorithm. In particular, whenever the CFL-reachability process adds a non-terminal edge to the automaton, I store references in that edge to the edges making up this derivation. This is similar to actions in syntax-directed translation [1]; I build a collection of parse trees for the automaton. In fact, the step in which I reconstruct a complete type environment is similar to attribute grammars in syntax directed translation [1]. To illustrate this process, I will run through a few steps using an example. First, let me return to the simple example in Figure 3. Here are a few steps (shown in Figure 4) of running my algorithm for discov - ering the type environments: Figure 4a. Because NAME is not a keyword, it must be an identier, so an edge labeled id is added between nodes 2 and 3. Figure 4b. The same goes for the two edges between nodes 4 and 5. However, the id edge from node 4 to 5 has two distinct derivations. This is dif - ferent from the standard CFL- reachability algorithm. With the standard algorithm, if an edge to be added is already present, then nothing needs to be done for that edge. In my example, sup - pose there is already an id edge from 4 to 5, which was added through the edge labeled TABLE 1. When the edge labeled TABLE 2 is to be processed, another id edge from 4 to 5 must be added. However, the edge is already present in the automaton. Instead of simply stopping (as is done in the standard CFL reachability algorithm), my algorithm adds a second derivation reference to the already- present id edge. This allows each context to be discovered when searching through the derivation edges. Notice that I can handle loops in the automaton by exploiting its simple looping structure. Due to space limitations, I omit the details here. Figure 4c. After these id edges are added, an edge labeled table_name is added from node 4 to node 5, which has a single derivation-the id edge from node 4 to node 5. Figure 4d. Then, an edge labeled table_list will be added from node 4 to node 5. Next, an edge la - beled select_part2 will be added from node 3 to node 5. This process continues, and eventually an edge labeled select_stmt is added from node 1 to node 6 (the nal graph is not shown due to space limita - tions). Now let me go back to my earlier example. After running my type environment reconstruction al - gorithm on this example, there is an edge from the start state of the automaton to its nal state, labeled select_stmt . The edge has a single derivation with two parts: a select edge and an edge labeled with the Figure 4. Sample steps in discovering type environments.1 2 3 4 5 6SELECT NAME FROM;id table-nam e table-nam e table-listid id ida. 1 2 3 4 5 6SELECT NAME FROM;id b. 1 2 3 4 5 6SELECT NAME FROM;id c. 1 2 3 4 5 Gould E x p l o r a t i o n s : A n U n d e r g r a d u a t e R e s e a r c h J o u r n a l 2 0 0 454 delimiter ';'. The select edge also has a single derivation: a link to a select_part1 edge and a link to a select_part2 edge. These links form different parse trees for the au - tomaton. By a top-down traversal of parse trees, I can determine which tables apply to which column lists, and with the schema for these tables, I can determine the possible types of each column. Then, I add type edges to the graph, replacing column names with their corresponding types. Notice that, because of the pos - sibility of multiple contexts, a column may have more than one type. In my example, I know that RETAIL is a column in the table INVENTORY , so I add an edge labeled in- teger to the graph. When I come across a primitive such as the edge labeled 100, I determine that it is not a column name, and must be a literal. At this point, I determine the literal's type and add it to the graph as an edge. In type environment reconstruction, some errors can be discovered. For instance, I can determine whether there is an invalid column that does not exist in any of the applicable tables for that column. If this happens, an error can be reported as either an improperly-quoted literal or a non-existent column. Other errors are also detected in this step, including duplicate table references (the same table appears more than once in the FROM clause), duplicate uses of the same table alias (two tables are assigned the same alias), and non-existent tables (the schema does not have a table referenced in the FROM clause). TYPECHECKING In the nal step of the analysis, I perform type-checking on the automaton produced in the previous step, as described in the previous section. At this stage, the automaton has been annotated to show the types of column names and literals. SQL 's simple type system lets me treat the type system as a context- free grammar. For example, the type rule for additions over integers looks like this: The above rule can be viewed as equivalent to the grammar rule: integer ::= integer +integer , which states that an integer plus an integer is again an integer. The other rules for type-checking SQL expressions can be handled in a similar manner. This is possible due to SQL 's simple type language-a collection of atomic types. This is in contrast to general purpose programming languages that have more complicated type structures. Table 2 shows a small subset of the context-free grammar for the type-checking rules of SQL 's SELECT statement. All the rules are straightforward, except the last one, which merits some explanation. The rule says that the conditional expression IN is well-typed if the sub-query inside the parentheses (here required to be of type integer ) reduces to a single column of type integer , when the outer expression is an integer. Thus, this rule requires the sub-query to be of the correct type. A similar rule, not shown here, exists for the varchar type. Notice that I did not specify all the rules-for example the rules for the SELECT statement. These rules are obvious, and I omit them in this paper due to space limitations. As in a standard type system, if none of the rules applies for a language construct, then a type error is discovered.Table 2. SQL SELECT statement type-system grammarE x p l o r a t i o n s : A n U n d e r g r a d u a t e R e s e a r c h J o u r n a l 2 0 0 4Static Checking of Dynamically Generated Queries in Database Applications 55 I apply the CFL-reachability algorithm using the grammar in Table 2 to propagate type informa - tion. If during the process, there is an expression that does not match any one of the right-hand sides of the rules, then an error is dis - covered. In some sense, there are implicit error rules in the gram - mar, such as errortype ::= integer + varchar . I illustrate type-checking with an example. Consider the small snippet shown in Figure 5a, which is taken from my working example. Before type- checking begins, the automaton is annotated with type informa - tion for the column names and literals, as shown in Figure 5b. Figures 5c-d show a few steps of type propagation using my grammar rules. If my type-checking step does not produce any edges la - beled errortype , then all the ob - ject-programs specied by the automaton are type-correct. On the other hand, if type-checking does produce an errortype edge, the analysis reports potential errors and displays a sample derivation that causes the type error. Note, however, that, due to imprecision in the automaton characterization of the object-programs, a reported error may not be an actual error in the original Java program. In the case of SQL, my analysis is precise under the assumption that all the object-programs specied by the automaton are feasible in the original Java source program. Figure 6 shows the edge er- rortype being added to a snippet of my example program, corre - sponding to the concatenation error between the character '$' and the numeric result of the di - vision. Note that many irrelevant edges are omitted in the gure. The two other errors present in my example can also be discov - ered in a similar manner. CORRECTNESS OF THE ANALYSIS Due to conservative approximations, my analysis may report a spurious (infeasible) error. In the next section, I present experimental data to support the claim that the analysis is rather precise and has low false-positive rates. Theorem 3.1 (Soundness) . My analysis is sound. In other words, if the analysis does not report any errors, then the generated object programs are type-safe.Figure 5. Sample steps of running CFL reachability. Figure 6. Discovering a type error.RETAIL / 100 ) (a. RETAIL / 100 ) (b. integer integer RETAIL / 100 ) (c. decimal::=integer/integerinteger integer integerRETAIL / 100 )Carl Gould E x p l o r a t i o n s : A n U n d e r g r a d u a t e R e s e a r c h J o u r n a l 2 0 0 456 Proof . [Sketch] I give a brief justication of the soundness theorem. I assume that the automaton that I operate on is a conservative approximation of the set of possible SQL query strings for a particular hotspot. This is guaranteed by the correctness of the string analysis in [6]. I also make the assumption that the query strings produced by the automaton are syntactically correct,6 which is crucial for the soundness of my analysis. Next, I can show that CFL-reachability considers all possible derivations of the query strings because the query strings are all of the correct syntax. Thus, the type-environment recon - struction step is correct, meaning that a column name is considered in all possible tables. For example, if I annotate an edge labeled by a column with the type integer, there must be a path in the automaton containing that edge such that the particular column is found to be of type integer. At the end of this step, all columns are labeled with a superset of actual types. Finally , if the resulting automaton contains a path with a type error, it will be detected because CFL-reachability considers all possible edge combinations. Experimental Evaluation I have tested a prototype tool that embodies my approach in its ability to detect programming errors in Java/JDBC applications. As any SQL developer will attest, every database vendor implements a differ - ent version of SQL; thus, checkers such as this one require some porting effort for each different database. I have implemented my analysis for the SELECT statement specied by the grammar for Oracle version 7 [7]. This grammar is a subset of what is specied in the SQL-92 standard. Adding support for other state - ments or different vendors is not difcult, because I have separated the type environment reconstruction and type-checking steps. In most cases, I would simply need to modify my syntax grammar and/or type- system rules (specied as input les in my analysis) and the recursive-descent code to traverse the parse trees and map column names with their possible types. In order to have a sound analysis, I have built a strict semantics into my tool: if a program is deemed type-safe by my analysis, it should be type-safe on any database system. Because the semantics of many database systems is not as strict as the one enforced by my tool, the tool may report an error that some database systems consider legitimate. My tool is implemented in Java and uses the string analysis in [6] for computing the FSA, which in turn uses the Soot framework [20] to parse class les and compute interprocedural control-flow graphs. I have tested my tool on various test programs, including student team projects from an undergraduate software engineering class, sample code from online tutorials found on the web, and code from other projects made available to me. Table 3 lists the test programs and summarizes my results. For each test program, I list the Java source code size (number of lines of source code), number of hotspots in the program, number of columns in the database schema, generated automaton size (number of edges and nodes), analysis time (split into automaton gen - eration and semantic analysis), and the numbers of various warnings and errors found (Table 4). Note Table 3. Experimental Results E x p l o r a t i o n s : A n U n d e r g r a d u a t e R e s e a r c h J o u r n a l 2 0 0 4Static Checking of Dynamically Generated Queries in Database Applications 57 that the test programs are sorted by automaton size, since for my analysis it is a good measure of the complexity of the programs. All experiments were done on a machine with a 2GHz Intel Xeon processor and 1 GB RAM, running Linux kernel 2.4.20. The re - sults indicate that my analysis is rather pre - cise, i.e., that it has a low false-positive rate. Because my analysis is sound, if the tool does not report any error on a program, then I have veried that the program is type-correct. In addition, although I have not tuned the per - formance of my implementation, the analysis is still quite efcient; it was able to analyze each of my test programs within a matter of minutes. I expect my analysis to scale to large systems, because analyses based on the same underlying algorithms have been shown to scale to millions of source lines of C [8, 18]. Further experiments are needed to verify this claim. Table 4 shows a breakdown of the kinds of errors found in the test programs, which I now explain in more detail: Concatenation of elds with wrong types. This is the same error as in the concatenation $ ||(RETAIL/100). After discovering this error in porting a program to a different (more strict) data - base, my tool has been used to nd all instances of the error in the \"PurchaseOrders\" program. Possibly unquoted string. Assume we have a comparison such as NAME = , where represents an unknown string. If there are no quotes in a string that possibly represents, then such an error oc - curs. Quoting a numerical value. This error happens when a numerical value is quoted but still treated as a numerical literal. This is a common error in student projects using MySQL, which permits numeri - cal literals to be quoted. Many other database systems also consider this an error, because quoted nu - merical literals are of type varchar . Ambiguous column selection. My tool detected such an error in some sample code from a tuto - rial website ( http://web-bureau.com/modules/sql.ph p). This error is quite subtle, and it appears to be unknown. The particular statement is: SELECT customer id FROM customers c, orders o WHERE c.customer id = o.customer id; The error is that the database does not know from which table it should choose the customer_id . Certainly , in this particular statement, it seems not to matter which customer_id it selects, but in general, the semantics of the column list should not depend on the outcome of the WHERE clause. Column not found. This error happens when a column name does not exist in any of the tables in the FROM clause. I found two distinct causes of this error-one a real error and the other a spurious error: Real error . The schema of the database does not include this column. This can be caused by either selecting a nonexistent column or missing the quotes around a literal, which as a result is treated as a column.Table 4. Breakdown of errors and warnings. Carl Gould E x p l o r a t i o n s : A n U n d e r g r a d u a t e R e s e a r c h J o u r n a l 2 0 0 458 Spurious error . This error is due to imprecision in the string analysis. Consider the following ex - ample, where makeQuery is a public method taking a string parameter tables to construct a FROM clause: public String makeQuery(String tables) f return \"SELECT name FROM \" + tables;g The string analysis adds an edge to the table list of the FROM clause (meaning any table is possible), in addition to the concrete table list it nds through analyzing other input classes. The reason is that this method is public, and the string analysis expects the possibility of other calls to the method and thus views the input classes as being incomplete. The presence of this edge causes the analysis to search for the column in an empty table list, which certainly fails. This is the only kind of spurious error I found in the test programs. These errors can easily be ltered out by modifying the string analysis to consider its input as a complete set of classes. Warning . I found one type of warning in the test programs. It is the same as the one illustrated in the earlier running example with which I began, in which, at runtime, a numerical column is compared with what is possibly a non-numerical value. I have shown that my tool can detect errors in non-trivial programs. To further evaluate the tool and to provide a programming aid to students, I plan to experiment by using the tool in an undergraduate software engineering class. Related Work Perhaps the most closely related work is the string analysis of Christensen, M\u00f8ller, and Schwartzbach [6], which forms the basis of my analysis. Their string analysis ensures that the generated object-pro - grams are syntactically correct. However, it does not provide any guarantee of semantic correctness for the object-programs. Many domain-specic languages have been proposed for ensuring correctness of dynamically generated web documents. Most of these are language extensions enhanced with tree ma - nipulation capabilities, instead of the string manipulations that I deal with in this work. In addition, they usually guarantee only that there will be syntactic correctness, not semantic correctness. There are two research efforts in static validation of dynamically generated web documents such as HTML that are worth noting here. In [16], the authors propose a typed, higher-order template language that provides safety of the dynamically generated web documents within the <bigwig> project [5], an extension to Java for high-level web service development. Their type system is based on standard data-flow analysis techniques [10, 12]. Another work along the same lines is the work by Braband et al [4] to statically validate dynamically generated HTML documents against the ofcial DTD for XHTML. Their work also is based on a data-flow analysis that computes a summary of all possible documents at a particular point in the program. The summary graph is then validated against the ofcial DTD for XHTML. This work is also done in the context of the <bigwig> language. In [11], a test adequacy criterion for data-intensive applications is presented. My approach is complementary; static analysis can save testing time, but test - ing can discover logical defects not related to SQL query construction. In a broader context, my research can be viewed as an instance of providing static safety guarantee for meta-programming [19]. Macros were the earliest meta-programming technique in which the issue of correctness of generated code rst arose. Using powerful macro programming languages, macro pro - grammers clearly needed to worry about the correctness of the generated code. How could such macro meta-programs be statically checked for correctness? The widely used cpp macro pre-processor does little checking, and allows one to write arbitrary macros without regard to correctness. The program -E x p l o r a t i o n s : A n U n d e r g r a d u a t e R e s e a r c h J o u r n a l 2 0 0 4Static Checking of Dynamically Generated Queries in Database Applications 59 mable syntax macros of Weise & Crew [22], which work at the level of correct abstract-syntax tree (AST) fragments, guarantee that generated code is syntactically correct with respect (specically) to the C lan - guage. Static type-checking is used to guarantee that AST fragments (e.g., Expressions, Statements, etc.) are assembled correctly by macro meta-programs. Another issue is scoping of generated names: macro expansion should not \"capture\" variable names in an unexpected manner. Hygienic macro expansion algorithms, beginning with Kohlbecker et al [13], provide these guarantees. More recent work seeks to extend the guarantees for syntax and scoping to the semantics of the gen - erated code. The work of Taha & Sheard [19] and others is concerned with guaranteeing (in a functional programming setting) that generated code is type-safe. I do not introduce a new macro language, like [22], nor work in a uniform functional setting, like [19], with functional languages both at meta- and target-levels. My goal is simply to ensure that strings passed into a database from an arbitrary Java pro - gram are type-safe SQL queries from the perspective of a given database schema. I expect that the general technique outlined in this paper can be extended to apply in other settings as well. Conclusions and Future Work I have presented a sound, static analysis technique for verifying the correctness of dynamically generated SQL query strings in database applications. My technique is based on applications of a string analysis for Java programs and a variant of the context-free language reachability algorithm. I have imple - mented this technique and have performed extensive testing of the tool on realistic programs. The tool has detected known and unknown errors in these programs, and its low false-positive rates on my test programs show that it is rather precise. Future work could go in several promising directions. To increase the usability of my tool for de - bugging, it would be interesting to map an error path that I nd in the automaton to the original Java source. One possible approach is to carry line numbers of the flow-graph nodes in the source code to the automaton, so that a path in the automaton can be associated with a set of source lines in the original Java program. A related problem is to check the correct uses of the query results in the source program. Consider the following example: query = ''SELECT NAME, SALARY FROM EMPLOYEE''; rset = statement.executeQuery(query); ... salary = rset.getInt(1); // should be getInt(2) name = rset.getString(2); // should be getString(1) The result set rset is a table of pairs of type String (the NAME column) and int (the SALARY col- umn). The statement salary = rset.getInt (1) attempts to read the rst eld of the pair, a string, and treat it as an integer. The last statement has a similar error. By mapping my analysis results back to the original program, I should be able to detect this class of errors. The class of embedded SQL command injection problems [21] in web and database applications is also interesting to consider. The problem is that, without proper input validation, an attacker can sup - ply arbitrary code to be executed by a web or database server, an extremely dangerous situation. I plan to extend my approach to deal with this class of errors. Finally , thus far I have considered only SQL. I believe my technique can be generalized and plan to investigate how to extend it to analyze dynamically generated programs in other languages.Carl Gould E x p l o r a t i o n s : A n U n d e r g r a d u a t e R e s e a r c h J o u r n a l 2 0 0 460 Acknowledgments I wish to thank my mentors and collaborators, Dr. Zhendong Su and Dr. Premkumar Devanbu, for their support of this research.

By contrast, the grammar is narrowed to a nite state automaton in [6] for syntax checking. This is done because, in general, checking the containment of a regular language by a context-free language is undecidable [9]. However, it is possible to work directly with the grammar from the flow graph or with one widened to a context-free grammar because the intersection of a context-free grammar with a regular expression is still context-free, and furthermore, it is easy to check the emptiness of a context-free grammar. 4. The problem is to maintain transitive closure of a graph while new basic graph edges can be added during graph closure. 5. In the gure, denotes an unknown string. 6.

In analyzing the role that independence had on the per capita income of territories, I hypothesize that in the 1970s, metropolitan powers chose to retain the territories that were strongest in terms of eco - nomic performance and to let go the weakest. Both qualitative and quantita - tive analyses show (1) that today's overseas territories' inherent economic advantages have played a signicant role in their current privileged situa - tion; (2) that generally there are both economic gains and losses associated with independence for territories; and nally, (3) that the ways in which metropolises developed their colonies also influenced the latter's economic performance after their independence. Introduction Sixty-three territories still bear the status of \"dependencies and areas of special sovereignty\" (CIA, 2003). Despite the waning of independence campaigns in the 1990s, their special status is a potential time-bomb in geopolitics. As Aldrich and Connell (1998) put it, \"the continued existence of such out - posts, and their intermittently problematic nature, poses questions about independence and dependence, just as steps towards closer integration of the European Union alongside legislatures in Scotland and Wales challenge notions of sovereignty and national identity\" (p. 1). Hence it is important to understand why these micro-territories still bear the flag of the metropo - lis when, since 1943, more than 140 others have gained sovereignty . Will they become independent? Logically , this question is two-fold and involves both the metropolis and the micro-territory . In other words, for both entities, what are the benets and the losses associated with independence? One way to treat this issue has been to ascertain the impact of independence on the territories' eco - nomic performance. Most of the economic literature has agreed that the remaining dependencies, thanks Sebastien Betermier E x p l o r a t i o n s : A n U n d e r g r a d u a t e R e s e a r c h J o u r n a l 2 0 0 464 to their dependency status, enjoy higher living standards than the newly independent states. Using an ordinary least squares panel regression dating back to 1970, Bertram and Karagedikli (2002) nd that remaining dependencies exhibit per capita incomes (PPP) ten times greater than newly independent microstates. Using a similar method and controlling for other factors, Armstrong and Read (2000) show for 1994 the regression of per capita GNP associated with independence for 105 territories, and conclude that \"there appear to be benets to being a dependency that more than compensate for other inherent advantages experienced by the tiny , fragmented nature of most of the remaining dependent territories\" (p. 303). While these analysts correctly point out that the gap between the GDPs of remaining dependencies and newly independent microstates in 2000 is considerable, they directly attribute it to the independence of the latter and do not explain the similar income inequality before 1970, when all examined territories were dependencies. In this analysis I take a new approach and account for the metropolises' assessments of the strategic value of their territories. I nd that, in the 1970s, metropolitan powers chose to retain the territories that were strongest in terms of economic performance and to let go the weakest, a move in line with their rational self-interests. Accounting for the territories' economic performance in 1970 through IV-instrument regressions has the result of showing that independence on average does not signicantly impact the territories' economic performance. This conclusion implies that the inherent economic ad - vantages of today's overseas territories' have also played a signicant role in their current privileged situ - ation and that, for the territories, there are both economic gains and losses associated with independence. The extent to which territories gain or lose from becoming independent, however, varies according to the ways in which the metropolises developed those territories A New Approach: The Selection Process Hypothesis THE INHERENT ADVANTAGES OF REMAINING DEPENDENCIES IN 1970 Denitions of microstates are numerous. According to the United Nations, the term \"microstate\" denotes a state with a population numbering one million or fewer. For this analysis, I extend the popula - tion size to 5 million to include Papua New Guinea and Puerto Rico. However, these two territories aside, among the 32 territories sampled in 2000, the average population is 207,415 and the median is 137,130. I refer to microstates that became independent after 1970 as newly independent states (NISs). These microstates share nothing in common with the former Communist republics, also commonly referred to as newly independent states. Due to a lack of available data, Djibouti and Suriname were not included in the dataset. A micro-territory is a microstate that has not declared independence, and is referred to in this essay as a remaining dependency (RD). Due to lack of available data, my analysis does not include many small RDs such as Wallis and Futuna, Niue, and Cocos Islands. Very few of these territories deliver their statistics to international institutions such as the World Bank and the United Nations. The studies of Armstrong and Read (2000) and of Bertram and Karagedikli (2002) attribute the current income inequality between RDs and NISs solely to the benets accrued by RDs from their de - pendency status. But in so doing, they do not explain the similar income inequality in 1970, when all the examined territories were dependencies. I base my analysis on the \"1999 United Nations National Accounts Statistics: Analysis of Main Aggregates.\" The data are converted from nominal to real $US, with base year 1990, using the GDP implicit price deflator. Figure 1 sets the stage by comparing average per capita incomes of 14 RDs and 19 NISs over 5-year intervals from 1970 to 2000.1 In 1970, the mean per capita income of the 14 RDs was about $7,147, whereas that of the 19 NISs approximated $2,042. That is to say , when all territories were dependent, the per capita income of the RDs was already 3.5 times larger than that of the NISs.E x p l o r a t i o n s : A n U n d e r g r a d u a t e R e s e a r c h J o u r n a l 2 0 0 4Selectivity and the Economics of Independence for Today's Overseas Territories 65 These gures raise a key question: Why were the economies of the RDs stron - ger than those of the NISs in 1970? Were they helped more by their metropolises? Or did they have inherent economic advantages? All territories re - ceived the same rights to mi - grate to the metropolises and were governed by similar s - cal policies. Only the amount of foreign aid provided dif - fered across territories. In ex - amining this factor, I looked at the amount of net over - seas development assistance per capita provided to 9 RDs and 14 NISs, according to the United Nations Yearbooks from 1970 to 2000. The data include both bilateral aid and multilateral aid from interna - tional organizations such as the World Bank, the U.N. and the I.M.F ., but do not include other forms of aid, such as currency arrangements that involve valuing the currency at a different rate from what the market would dictate. The data reveal that some dependencies prot from massive nancial transfers from their metropolises, led by the 880 mil - lion dollars a year received by New Caledonia. Since 1976, Mayotte's economy has soared relative to Comoros', but Mayotte received more than 100 million dollars from France every year since, or ten times what Comoros collected yearly . Greenland and the Faroe Islands as well receive more than 500 million dollars each year from Denmark. Following a disastrous volcanic eruption in Montserrat in 1995, the islands were granted a 122 million dollars \"rescue package\" from the United Kingdom to rebuild its tiny economy . But the aid factor alone does not explain the large income gap in 1970. Even though RDs received amounts of foreign aid (largely bilateral) that were greater (in absolute terms) than that received by NISs (mostly multilateral), the percentage of per capita foreign aid has followed the opposite path. As Figure 2 illustrates, whereas foreign aid per capita represented on average 16% of the per capita GDP of NISs in 1970, it only made up 11.8% of the per capita GDP of RDs. Soon after the microstates gained inde - pendence, the associated loss of bilateral foreign aid was offset by an increase in multilateral aid. In their study , Armstrong and Read (2000) regress per capita GNP on the net overseas development assistance Figure 1. Average real GDP/cap for RDs and NISs, 1970-2000. Figure 2. Foreign aid as a percentage of income for RDs and NISs, 1970-2000.

Hence it is unlikely that the economies of RDs were performing better in 1970 due to a higher level of foreign aid. Instead, it would appear that many RDs possess unique characteristics allowing them to enjoy larger economic growth. Due to its geographical position, French Guyana, for instance, is one of the few ideal spots in the world to launch rockets into space.. The large number of geographically isolated atolls in French Polynesia and the Marshall Islands provides good opportunities for France and the United States, respectively , to execute their nuclear tests. Finally , some territories may host potential sea-bottom min - eral resources. Many studies nd that the Pacic Ocean sea-crust floor contains tremendous amounts of mineral resources enclosed in nodules that lie near tectonic rifts. Even though we have not yet found ways to exploit these nodules, future technology may yield great economic growth, and the metropolises of territories such as the Cook Islands, French Polynesia, and the Northern Mariana Islands, whose 200- Mile Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) hosts mineral resources, might gain particularly from retaining these territories. THE EXISTENCE OF A SELECTION PROCESS I have suggested that the 1970 income gap was due primarily to inherent differences among the economies of territories. If true, then why did only the worst performing territories gain independence? I argue that the metropolises engaged in a selection process, which took place because the power rela - tionship between metropolises and territories is both uneven and unique, for reasons detailed in this section. Reflecting upon the key question of why the independence of most micro-territories took place rela - tively late enlightens the matter. Out of the 26 states with fewer than one million inhabitants, only 5 be - came independent before 1970. There are two possible explanations for this fact: (1) the small population size of these micro-territories prevented them from ghting effectively for independence, or (2) micro- territories proved to have some strategic value to their metropolises and thus were worthwhile to retain. The rst explanation, focusing on the conditions within the territory , has been accounted for in numerous histories of de-colonization. According to this viewpoint, nations with a large population size gained solid leverage power and became independent rst, starting with India in 1947. A deeper analysis, however, suggests that the political fate of a territory is determined by a complex game model2 between the people from the territory and those from the metropolis. Despite this dynamic, as the population size of the territory diminishes, the capacity of the metropolis to influence the territory's status (as dependent or not) increases, whereas that of the territory decreases. It becomes much easier for the metropolis to bribe leaders, control the allocation of resources, and mold the social and political reactions within the small territories. In the case of micro-territories, this means that the metropolitan power has retained rel - atively high control over the political fate of the territories. Historical evidence shows that metropolises have generally acted in subtle ways to influence the territories' political status. Only when metropolises gradually lost interest in some of their colonies did they display some enthusiasm in negotiating with the territories' pro-independence parties; this was the case for the United Kingdom, for example (Arby , 1975). Migdal (1998) argues that, as a result of the metropolises' strategies, \"many long-standing values necessary to maintain a cohesive social and community order in specic societies were disturbed, often beyond redemption.\" The second explanation focuses on the metropolis and its assessment of the strategic value of over - seas territories. In general, colonies have served as mines of primary economic resources or as outlets for excess of unwanted population. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, big territories such as today's Democratic Republic of the Congo and Australia fullled these respective purposes and indeed largely E x p l o r a t i o n s : A n U n d e r g r a d u a t e R e s e a r c h J o u r n a l 2 0 0 4Selectivity and the Economics of Independence for Today's Overseas Territories 67 contributed to the growth of the metropolises' economies. The military effort that France expended to retain Algeria before 1962 and that Britain expended in India before 1947 clearly reflects the attachment of the metropolises toward these productive dependencies. On the other hand, micro-territories such as Montserrat and Niue could not provide the same kind of colonial value to metropolises. Many studies have examined the economic problems faced by microstates and have found that they are often insular and remote, are endowed with only limited natural resources, depend on a narrow range of products and on export markets, cannot generate economies of scale, have limitations on domestic competitiveness, struggle with problems of public administration, depend on foreign sources of nance, and are prone to natural disasters (Briguglio, 1995). Conditions such as these make it easier for the metropolis to release its control of the territory . This was the case when a 1960 hur - ricane in Niue resulted in the homelessness of 4000 out of a population of 4780 people and wiped out copra production for two years, and when in 1979 tidal surges destroyed hundreds of homes on Majuro in the Marshall Islands (Knapman, 1994). Finally , Armstrong and Read (2000) dene the concept of sub-optimality , and contend that the sub-optimal size of microstates' home markets means that domestic demand for many goods and services lies below their minimum efcient scale (MES) of output. Nevertheless, micro-territories often possessed a unique type of colonial value: their geographic locations allowed for communications between the metropolis and other bigger territories. Particularly during the 19th century , most micro-territories served as ports of call for boats that traveled along the fa - mous Silk Trail. As Uhligh (Coletta, 1985) remarks, the need for a coaling station was among the reasons for American interest in acquiring the Hawaiian Islands and Samoa. Guam was a refueling stop for the commercial airliners crossing the Pacic with troops bound for World War II. Moreover, many of these territories, especially the Dutch Antilles, often served as hubs for the huge and protable slave trade. By the early 1900s, technological advances, especially in the aeronautic industry , as well as the worldwide abolishment of slavery , had diminished somewhat the colonial reliance on these micro-territories, even though many of the islands (French Polynesia and Guam, for example) still hosted important military bases for metropolitan powers. These factors explain why the independence of microstates took place after that of big and more resourceful territories. On the whole, the situation of micro-territories is atypical. Not only does their small population size often restrain them from ghting for independence, but also their geographic lo - cation creates a crucial link for increased trade and communications between the metropolis and more resourceful territories, and thus provides a powerful incentive for the metropolis to retain them as de - pendencies. For the larger territories, then, this set of circumstances suggests that, as independence was gained, intra-colonial trade declined and the metropolises no longer saw as much interest in retaining micro-territories. Hence, together with the income gap between NISs and RDs in 1970, it is likely that metropolises chose to retain the best performing territories and to let go the weakest. In an article on the prospects of Puerto Rico's independence, Ingram (2001) points out, \"we have found no example of an imperial power casting off a colony or territory against the latter's wishes, or of a colony declaring its independence and be - coming an independent nation without either a revolution or the consent of the imperial nation\" (p. 93). Introducing the concept of selectivity , Bertram and Karagedikli (2002) write, \"former colonial pow - ers might be argued to have been keen to divest themselves of poor territories such as Papua New Guinea or Kiribati while holding onto more 'worthwhile' possessions such as New Caledonia\" (p. 4). Yet they choose to ignore this argument in light of the fact that New Caledonia and Kiribati possess the same level of economic resources. What they do not consider is that metropolises have interests in their territories beyond economic resources. More importantly , Bertram and Karagedikli do not compare like territories. Whereas New Caledonia is a French Territory , Kiribati and Papua New Guinea were former UN Trust Sebastien Betermier E x p l o r a t i o n s : A n U n d e r g r a d u a t e R e s e a r c h J o u r n a l 2 0 0 468 Territories of the Pacic. It would be more useful to look at the economic differences among the territo - ries belonging to the same metropolis. For instance, why did the Seychelles Islands gain independence while the Cayman Islands remained a British Overseas Territory? Some metropolises have also been more anxious than others to retain their territories. France, for example, spent great effort to retain and develop its territories. Following its experience with Comoros, which became independent in 1974, France agreed in the late 1980s to retain and \"departmentalize\" Mayotte. In its attempt to retain New Caledonia, France sent troops from the early 1980s to 1998 and pressed for the Noumea Agreement, which prevented Kanak secessionists from escalating the conflict. In contrast, the United Kingdom never opposed the independence of the Fiji islands after the 1960s, perhaps because, as Peter Hempenstall (1994) remarks, \"A mixture of ofcial ennui, hostile Treasury sentiments and [...] public enthusiasm set the various hues of Britain's policy toward overseas expansion in mid-century\" (p. 31). In light of my hypothesis about the selection process of metropolises, a revised analysis of the im - pact of independence on the economic performance of territories is warranted. If the best performing territories remained dependent because of inherent strengths, logic would suggest that, ceteris paribus , they should still enjoy greater per capita incomes than NISs. But this is not what we nd. Therefore, we should investigate instead the evolution of the territories' economies, regardless of their pre-indepen - dence status. The Real Impacts of Independence on the Economic Performance of Territories THE LOSSES The effects of independence may be misjudged if one ignores the selection process. In fact, as my empirical analysis shows, the impact of independence, given the selection process, is no longer signi - cant on average, although it varies according to the ways metropolises developed their territories. This section outlines the main economic losses and gains associated with independence. On the one hand, the ratio of per capita income gap between NISs and RDs gradually increased from 3.5 to 4.5 between 1970 and 2000 (as has already been shown in Figure 1). In 2000, the mean per capita income in the14 RDs was about $13,220, whereas that in the 20 NISs was approximately $2,895. NISs experienced their worst economic performance between 1975 and 1985, the period corresponding to the largest number of NISs declaring independence. Why did the average NIS suffer negative growth rates below -3% while RDs enjoyed growth rates exceeding 3% in 1980? The near-term impact of independence is hard to measure since metropolises did not immediately cut off ties with territories. Moreover, the percentage of total foreign aid for NISs did not decrease after independence, because the loss of bilateral foreign aid was offset by an increase in multilateral aid. NISs, however, gradually lost other important benets of being dependent. For instance, NISs suffered from losing what I refer to as the \"territory's nancial advantages.\" Prior to independence, they proted from the increasingly high scal pressure in the metropolises, since most of the territories impose lower tax rates. As a result, as taxes have increased in metropolises since the 1970s, many citizens of the metropolis transferred their assets to the territories, and economic growth in these territories soared. The extreme case applies to the UK, most of whose territories during the 1950s were converted into secure tax havens. The Bermudas, T urks and Caicos Islands, and the Cayman Islands, for example, now enjoy some of the world's highest per capita income, exceeding $25,000. In ad - dition, it is likely that independence was associated with a fall in nancial investment from foreign rms. As political conditions deteriorated in many territories (e.g., Solomon Islands, Fiji) soon after indepen - dence, foreign investors withdrew their nancial assets to wait for a more secure nancial environment. On the other hand, the backstage presence of the well-developed metropolises in the RDs has always E x p l o r a t i o n s : A n U n d e r g r a d u a t e R e s e a r c h J o u r n a l 2 0 0 4Selectivity and the Economics of Independence for Today's Overseas Territories 69 been a guarantee for foreign investors. Metropolises also invest a lot in dependent territories in terms of allowing the territorial population to migrate to the metropolis. This investment benets territories for three primary reasons: rst, it allows students from the territories to obtain post-baccalaureate degrees and to migrate back to their territories afterwards; second, these immigration outlets are sources of remittances; and third, the option to migrate back to the metropolis prevents these territories from being affected by the Dutch Disease. The Dutch Disease effects are well explained by the Migration Aid Remittances Bureaucracy model (MIRAB) proposed by Bertram (1986) and by Laplagne, Treadgold, and Baldry (2000). One of the central tenets of the MIRAB hypothesis is that the flow of aid may change the structure and diminish the pro - ductivity of the economy . The exchange rate appreciates, exports become uncompetitive, and in turn the nation's export industry declines. Laplagne, Treadgold, and Baldry's (2000) empirical study shows that an injection of aid results in the emigration of the former employees of the tradables sector. In other words, the possibility for the territories' inhabitants to migrate to the metropolis prevents the unemployment rate from rising. In this respect, RDs are beneting because it is relatively easier for their inhabitants to migrate to the metropolis. In Reunion, for instance, emigration was high and unem - ployment low until France raised the RMI (Revenu Minimal d'Insertion) and thus reduced incentives to migrate. As a result, the unemployment rate soared to more than 40% (Poirine, 1994). Remittances can also become important sources of income for the territory . Poirine argues that remittances should bring islanders closer to the welfare optimum. The MIRAB model's other implicit prediction is that a RD is somehow isolated from decreasing in - dustrial competitiveness due to its use of the metropolis' currency and the direct subsidization of its key industries. This subsidization allows the RDs to maintain a greater industrial productivity and a lower unemployment rate than NISs. As Laplagne, Treadgold, and Baldry (2001) write, this RD-advantage is non-negligible, since \"there is a real risk that, once deprived of tariff protection and public subsidies, import-competing and export enterprises [in RDs] will not be able to survive inflated production costs\" (p. 378). Meanwhile, RDs sustained a more stable economic growth rate than NISs. As was shown in Figure 2, the RDs' average growth rate remained positive from 1970 to 2000, and their economies remained stable, with a ratio of per capita foreign aid to per capita income that was relatively xed. THE GAINS As previously noted, the economic losses sustained by NISs are due primarily to the unavailability of previous nancial benets and to the decreased opportunity for migration to their metropolises. These losses are associated with a drop in economic stability , especially in the short run following independence. However, NISs have also become more self-reliant and their surprisingly high economic performance in the 1990s reflects various economic gains associated with independence. As Armstrong and Read (2000) argue, \"many of the microstates granted independence in the 1950's and 1960's have gone to achieve suc - cess and the early pessimistic tone of much of the research literature has now receded\" (p. 289). The reasons are numerous. First, NISs have begun to exploit the various development programs in order to obtain access to a wide range of multilateral development assistance. Bartmann (2000) compares sovereignty to an \"international green card,\" as the NIS discovered new sources of investment, ofcial assistance with development, and diplomatic recognition. Meanwhile, many of them managed to main - tain good ties with former metropolises. For example, France continued to be the major aid contribu - tor to Djibouti and Comoros ten years after their independence, accounting for 50-75% of all bilateral assistance (Bartmann, 2000). In the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, and Palau, the US dollar remains the ofcial currency . Sebastien Betermier E x p l o r a t i o n s : A n U n d e r g r a d u a t e R e s e a r c h J o u r n a l 2 0 0 470 Second, the NISs had begun to experience an increase in internal political stability , as political turmoil following independence was frequent in many microstates such as Cape Verde, Fiji, and the Solomon Islands. Although political stability can not be claimed denitively as a source of economic growth, a correlation has been noted. Within the Caribbean, three island countries-St Kitts and Nevis, St Lucia, and Antigua and Barbuda-have been the best performers since 1980, with average annual growth rates ranging from 4.9 to 5.2% (Ramkissoon, 2002). Finally , both microstates and territories recently reduced their dependence on the public sector, composed mainly of non-tradable goods, in order to boost their export-industry productivity , as pre - dicted by the MIRAB model. In the past, RDs have been more isolated from the Dutch Disease Effects, and therefore cutbacks in their dependence on the public sector did not have much effect. For the NISs, however, this reduction probably contributed to their recent economic growth. Te'o Fairbairn (2002) nds that the Cook Islands-where public expenditure constituted about 86% of the territory's GDP-pro - posed to reduce public service employment by 60% in 1996. Similarly , Nauru and the Solomon Islands are attempting to cut the size of their public sectors. Hence, NISs are seeking to immunize themselves from the Dutch Disease Effects. Their recent and \"new\" economic growth reflects this effort to diversify their economies and to become more self-reliant. In fact, the correlation between the amount of foreign aid and the economic performance of the 18 NISs sampled is approximately -11.2%, a surprisingly low coefcient. On the other hand, the same correlation for the 14 RDs amounts to 31.5%. Assuming that economic growth does not result in increased foreign aid, this high correlation shows that the economic performance of RDs relies more heavily than that of NISs on foreign aid. On the other hand, it is not likely that all RDs will remain immune to the Dutch Disease effects. For instance, can emigration of the territories' populations always be counted upon to fuel the territories' economies? Jean-Louis Rallu (1986, p. 36) predicts that eventually remittances will level off or even decline, due to \"donor fatigue\" and to the decline of fertility rates. Since the 1980s, the fertility rates in American Samoa and French Overseas Territories have already declined. Statistical Determinants of Independence and Per Capita Income PRESENTATION It is possible to test empirically the relationship between independence and economic performance. Such analyses, the results of which were presented in the previous section, have been conducted by Armstrong and Read (2002) and by Bertram and Karagedikli (2002). Both studies conclude that becom - ing independent results in a lowering of per capita income. Armstrong and Read (2002) performed a multivariate cross-section regression to study the impact of independence on per capita GNP in 1994, controlling for exogenous factors such as tourism, manufacture, and offshore banking. Their results are robust, but some regressors appear to be correlated both with the error and with each other. The amount of mineral resources in the microstate, for instance, may have accounted both for the metropolises' ratio - nale in retaining some dependencies and for the economic welfare of the microstates. Furthermore, their discriminant analysis lacks the explanatory power of a regression analysis. Bertram and Karagedikli (2002) conduct a single-equation panel regression since 1970 and analyze whether sovereignty and the economic performance of the metropolis affect the economic performance of the overseas territory . However, their dataset is incomplete, as data for every time period is not provided for all of the 22 sampled territories. Moreover, they mix currency-exchange values of per capita income with purchasing-power-parity (PPP) values, leading to biased and imprecise results of the income values. Finally , these two empirical analyses do not take into account the selection process hypothesis. When examining the role of independence on GDP/cap PPP , the challenge is to overcome simultaneous E x p l o r a t i o n s : A n U n d e r g r a d u a t e R e s e a r c h J o u r n a l 2 0 0 4Selectivity and the Economics of Independence for Today's Overseas Territories 71 causality bias. If independence is considered to be the dependent variable and GDP/cap PPP the indepen - dent one, perhaps the nations with a very high GDP/cap PPP are the ones most likely to remain integrated with the metropolis, given the selection process. Thus, the Instrument Variables IV Regression model ts this study best. Since independence is endogenous in my case, I isolate the exogenous components of the independence variable in order to then regress GDP/cap on the predicted value of the \"exogenous\" independence. The idea of the model is the following. I rst use my data to conrm the conclusions of previous studies, such as those by Bertram and Karagedikli (2002) and by Armstrong and Read (2002). That is, I ascertain the impact of endogenous independence on the economic performance of territories in order to show that my data match with those of others and thus should not be ignored. Second, I justify the selection process hypothesis by conducting a probit regression of independence on pre-independence per capita income. Third, I withdraw per capita income from the equation to test the impact of various in - strumental variables on independence in probit and logit regressions. Finally , I use these predicted values of \"exogenous\" independence and plug them back into my rst regression in order to nd out whether independence really had an impact, positive or negative, on the per capita income of micro-territories. In other words, the model has the following form and steps: A. Y1= \u00df0 + \u00df1Y2 + ciXi Y2=1)= [ (0 + djZj )]; (Table 2) C. (a) P(Fitted Y2=1)= [ (1 + iZi)]; (Table 3) (b) \u00df5(Fitted Y2) + ciZi + 2, for (a) and (b). (Table 4 a-b) [All tables can be found in the Appendix] Here Y1 represents GDP/cap and Y2 is the binary endogenous independence variable. Fitted Y2 is the exogenous independence variable. It is treated in various ways, as explained in each section. The Xi are the exogenous regressors, and the Zj are the instrumental variables for independence. The coefcients \u00dfi, ci, dj, and i are the IV regression parameters. In the probit variant, is the cumulative standard nor - mal distribution function. Since I have more instrument variables (Zi) than endogenous regressors (only independence) in my model, the problem of under-identication does not apply . In the logit variant, F is the logistic cumulative distribution function. The data set used is longitudinal. It consists of the economic indicators mentioned later, in both remaining overseas territories and newly independent small-island states since 1970, spread out in ve- year intervals. It is similar to the one in the qualitative analysis and is composed of 14 RDs and 20 NISs. In their study , Armstrong and Read (2002) use a larger dataset composed of 105 territories, including 41 RDs. But they conduct a cross-section empirical analysis for 1994 only , a time at which most small terri - tories begin to display statistical information. The sources for all my variables are specied in the \"Index of Variables Used\" (Appendix). My six instruments (Zi) are assumed to affect independence only . First, the share of foreign-born population is a good indicator of the metropolis' attachment to its territory . Assuming all the foreign-born population comes from the metropolis, I argue that the higher the percentage of foreign-born population, the greater the pressure this population will exert on the metropolis for the territory to stay dependent. In 1975, for instance, 35% of the population in American Samoa (RD) was foreign-born, compared with 1.12% in Cape Verde (NIS). Second, I also include latitude as an indicator of the rate of mortality in these territories. This indicator evidently is imprecise; however, many studies link latitude with the territory's Sebastien Betermier E x p l o r a t i o n s : A n U n d e r g r a d u a t e R e s e a r c h J o u r n a l 2 0 0 472 susceptibility to certain diseases and hence with the territory's mortality rate. Third, the percentage of arable land reflects the territory's capacity for self-reliance in food production. Less available arable land implies higher subvention costs from the metropolis and consequently a higher likelihood of becoming independent. Fourth, the number of years during which the territory was dependent also represents the social attachment of the metropolis to the territory . The longer the territory is independent, the greater the chance of its becoming integrated. Fifth, the economic situation of the metropolis is represented by its demand (inflation rate - unemployment rate) and supply shocks (inflation rate + unemployment rate). I hypothesize that the more difcult economic times the metropolis undergoes, the less willing it is to support its territories nancially , and so the greater the likelihood that the territory will gain indepen - dence. Sixth, the territory's population size indicates its leverage power and influence on the territory's political fate. Other relevant instrument variables such as the literacy rate and the territory's readiness to ght for independence were not used due to lack of available data. Similarly , I chose four exogenous regressors (Xi) for per capita income. The literature on microstates points to their reliance on these regressors: tourism, nancial services, natural resources, and workers' re - mittances (Briguglio, 1995, Amstrong and Read, 2000, Ramkisson, 2002). I was able to gather data for the rst two factors. First, the extent to which the territory's environment fosters tourism (climate, lagoon, beaches) is an indicator of the importance of the tourism sector and hence of economic performance. Second, the presence of an offshore banking industry brings in the nancial centers of various multina - tional rms and thus develops the territory's economy . Third, I added a variable concerning the presence of a military base. Often the presence of the military base lowers the unemployment rate in the territory and increases the level of production. This variable is assumed to be unrelated to the independence vari - able. The United States, for example, prots from military posts not only in its dependencies (such as Guam) but also in various independent states (such as the Philippines). Fourth, the percentage of urban population reflects the industrial level of the territory , even though causality is hard to establish. A few binary variables-indicating which metropolitan power owns or owned the territories-are included in the regressions. For instance, the French territory binary variable covers territories that are remaining French territories as well as former French territories. The United Kingdom binary variable is taken out, and hence every other binary coefcient represents the differential effect of each metropolis relative to the UK All territories that were former members of the UN Trust Territory of the Pacic before their independence (Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Palau, Kiribati) are encompassed in the binary vari - able UNTTP . In a later section, I set up interaction terms between independence and these metropolis binaries in order to observe the effects of independence given the territory's former colonial power. In the T wo Stage Least Square Estimator-the one estimating (IV) regression-there were a few factors that presented challenges to controlling the bias. One was that the data includes the presence of a few statistical outliers in the data set. With almost four millions inhabitants, Puerto Rico, among all overseas territories, is unique in that regard and can potentially distort the results. Another challenge was that, in the case of some territories during the period just before independence, the model and dataset might not include all relevant factors. For instance, if the metropolis rebuts the demands of a territory to become independent, then there is the potential for social tensions within the territory or for military conflict with the metropolis, either of which could impede the territory's economy . Hence, as suggested earlier, the game opposing the people from the territory to those from the metropolis may distort the values during the period close to the independence of the micro-territory . Finally , information concerning these micro-territories may not be complete and precise. The present data on per capita income has been con - verted into US dollars through exchange rates and may not fully reflect real economic performance due to over- or under-valuation of the national currency .E x p l o r a t i o n s : A n U n d e r g r a d u a t e R e s e a r c h J o u r n a l 2 0 0 4Selectivity and the Economics of Independence for Today's Overseas Territories 73 Conrmation of Previous Single-equation Studies The rst results conrm those achieved in previous studies by Bertram and Karagedikli (2002) and Amstrong and Read (2002). In this model the dataset size is 238, which consists of 34 territories and 7 time periods. I regress here the growth of per capita income on the observed values of independence and on the Xi exogenous factors, knowing that the error term may be correlated with the independence vari - able (Equation A). Independence is treated as a binary variable, so that it equals 0 when it is dependent and 1 when the territory obtained independence during or prior to the specied ve-year period. A) Y1= \u00df0 + \u00df1Y2 + ciXi + 1 Table 1 (see Appendix) displays the OLS estimates of log per capita income against independence in a variety of samples. Within the table, the results under the column labeled \"(1)\" (representing equation 1) show that there is a strong correlation between independence and per capita income, and the high R-square (99.4%) indicates that almost all the variation in income per capita is associated with variation in the independent factors. As predicted, becoming independent signicantly decreases the territory's economic growth, by almost 20% on average. Also as predicted, all the other exogenous regressors yield signicantly positive economic effects. The territories' economies increase by 40% when hosting a military base, by almost 75% when operating an offshore banking industry , and by 20% when running a tourism industry\u2014although only signicant at a 20% level. Internal migration toward urban areas is also associated with an increase in per capita income. In equation (2), the metropolis dummies are added and allow me to compare the performance of RDs and NISs with respect to their former metropolises. American territories perform the best, fol - lowed by the French, the Dutch, the British, the UN Trust Territories, the New Zealand, and nally the Portuguese. Is this because the US and French territories picked up especially good territories from the start or because they developed them better? Likewise, did New Zealand and Portugal end up with the poorest territories, or did they do a poorer job developing them? Isolating the pre-independence per capita income (which will be done later) helps answer this question. THE EXISTENCE OF A SELECTION PROCESS Before moving into IV-instrument regressions, we can see that Table 2 (Appendix) conrms the existence of the selection process hypothesis. Here I conduct a probit regression model of independence against the pre-independence per capita income of territories (using Equation B)3. B) P(Fitted Y2=1)= [ (0 +\u00df3(Y1) + djZj )] I study this relationship by treating whether a territory gains new freedoms, (IndexUp) using an or - dinal index from 1 to 4, with 1 as fully dependent, 2 as having some self-rule, 3 as having full autonomy in internal affairs (associated state status), and 4 as fully independent. Because I am looking at the period before independence in the case of NISs, the dataset size diminishes to 127. Furthermore, there is no perfect R-square measure for the probit model, so I report the Cragg-Uhler measure, as it produces values between 0 and 1. A 1% loss in per capita income is associated with a highly signicant 1.23% increase in the prob - ability that the territory gains new freedoms, when all the instrument variables are kept constant at their mean values. In other words, a considerable economic depression in a territory would seriously affect its likelihood of remaining dependent. This conrms the selection process hypothesis detailed in the quali -Sebastien Betermier E x p l o r a t i o n s : A n U n d e r g r a d u a t e R e s e a r c h J o u r n a l 2 0 0 474 tative analysis. The model I use is relevant, as more than 90% of the actual observations were predicted. When the metropolis dummies are introduced in equation 2, I nd that, while controlling for the pre-independence per capita income of territories, being a Portuguese territory increases the chances of a territory becoming independent relative to being a UK dependency , whereas being an American, French, Dutch, or New-Zeland territory decreases these chances. However, with the exception of the UN Trust Territories and the French territories, the dummy variables are not signicant. Phrased differently , the United States, Portugal, New Zealand, and the Netherlands have been as willing as the United Kingdom to retain their colonies since 1970. In light of the nding (in the qualitative analysis) that after 1945 the British were especially reluctant to develop their colonies, the implication is that the British, Portuguese, New Zealand, and Dutch territories are especially vulnerable to the selection process. In the US case, it is difcult to infer from the regression results, since Puerto Rico is the only American dependency sampled. Thus, as noted earlier, American and Dutch territories, which saw no signicant effort on the part of their metropolises to retain them, performed relatively well, whereas former New Zealand and Portuguese territories displayed relatively poor economic performance. Being a French dependency , however, signi - cantly reduces the chances of becoming independent. As explained in the qualitative analysis, France showed strong interest in retaining its colonies. Their convincing economic performance makes it appear likely that these territories both were initially strong and have been well developed. IV-INSTRUMENT VARIABLE REGRESSIONS ON INDEPENDENCE I now conduct the same regression analysis but without accounting for the pre-independence eco - nomic performance of the territories (Equation C). C) (a) P(Fitted Y2=1)= [ (1 + iZi)] (b) P(Fitted Y2=1)= F ( 1 + iZi) Table 3 (see Appendix) displays the ndings. Equations (1) and (2) use the indexed independence as the dependent variable and the probit regression. Although the percentage of right predictions ap - proximates 88%, the R-square is low and the instruments are rather weak. Only the number of years during which the territory was a dependency is signicant at the 10% level. In equations (3) to (6), independence should be interpreted as the probability that a territory will gain independence (GotInd). Hence the predicted values vary between 0 and 1. Equations (3) and (4) display the results of the probit regressions. The R-square jumps to 39.93% and to 62.67%, respectively , with the binary coefcients. As expected, a 1% decrease in the percentage of the foreign-born population leads to almost a 1% probability that the territory will gain independence. Second, a one-unit increase in a shock affecting the demand for goods and services in the metropolis leads to an 11% increase in the probability of gaining independence (equation (3)). However a similar increase in a supply shock decreases the probability of a territory gaining independence by 17% Third, when adding the metropolis dummies, the impact of the change in population size is highly signicant. A 1% increase in the territory's population size leads to a 66% increase in the probability of gaining independence. Finally , since the percentage of arable land and the latitude are xed values, their real impact on independence is not seen in the panel regression. In cross-section regressions of the probability of be - coming independent (GotInd) on these two regressors in 1975, 1980, and 1985, the latitude coefcient remains negative during the three periods and is signicant only in 1980. In sum, the territories closer to the Equator, which exhibit higher mortality rates, have higher probabilities of gaining independence. The percentage of arable land, however, again provides inconsistent estimates. E x p l o r a t i o n s : A n U n d e r g r a d u a t e R e s e a r c h J o u r n a l 2 0 0 4Selectivity and the Economics of Independence for Today's Overseas Territories 75 The similar results of the logit regressions in equations (5) and (6) conrm the results obtained in the probit regressions. THE REVISED IMPACT OF INDEPENDENCE ON ECONOMIC GROWTH T wo-Stage Least Square probit and logit estimates are presented in Tables 4a and 4b (Equation D), respectively (see Appendix). D) Y1= \u00df4 + \u00df5(Fitted Y2) + ciZi + 2, for (a) and (b) The values of exogenous independence are computed from the GotInd probit and logit regressions without the metropolis dummies (Equations (3) and (5) from Table 3). Excluding the dummies is war - ranted because the use of 6 or 7 instruments with only 127 observations leads to the \"too-many-in - struments\" problem, typically biasing the IV-estimate toward the OLS estimate. The size of the dataset increases back to 238. The predicted values apply only for the periods during which each territory was dependent. When a territory has already gained independence, its probability of becoming independent is null. Hence, the predicted value coefcients indicate the immediate effects of independence-that is, over the ve- year period following independence. In order to obtain a binary independence variable that is not tied to pre-independence per capita income, 5-year independence lags computed from the observed values are added to the equation. In this way , my lagged independence variable is controlled by the predicted independence variable and measures the effects of independence on per capita income in the 10 years following independence. By combining predicted and observed values, I also eliminate possible multi- collinearity effects. The corresponding 2SLS estimate of the impact of independence on per capita income is on average small and no longer signicant. In the probit and logit regressions (equation (1) in Tables 4a and 4b), independence is associated on average with respective 3% and 2% drops in per capita income. When the metropolis binaries are added (equation (2) in Tables 4a and 4b) the independence coefcients are positive and again approximate only 3%. The insignicance of the independence effect is robust in all four equations. This key nding implies that: (1) today's overseas territories have inherent economic advantages that have played a signicant role in their current privileged situation, and (2) there are both economic gains and losses associated with independence for territories, as suggested by the qualitative analysis. It is important to note that all the other regressors maintain their predicted impact, with the ex - ception of the variable of the offshore banking industry for NISs. The nding indicates that in general the RDs' offshore banking industries performed better than those of the NISs. Reasons for this discrepancy include the \"territory's nancial advantages,\" as analyzed in the qualitative analysis. In equations (3) of Tables 4a and 4b, interaction terms between the lagged independence and the metropolis dummies are added in order to measure the effects of independence given the territory's former colonial power. I must omit, however, the variables for independence from Netherlands, New Zealand, and the United States because there are none in the sample. The coefcients of these interac - tion terms represent the relative effects of independence for territories. To compute the absolute effects I add to these coefcients the new lagged independence variable, which represents the absolute effect of independence for UK territories. Whereas the impact of independence on per capita income is not signicant on average, the effects of independence vary according to the ways metropolises developed their territories. For instance, for a British territory , becoming independent is associated with an 11% increase in its per capita income. Similarly , the economic performance of a former French territory decreased by more than 50% in the rst Sebastien Betermier E x p l o r a t i o n s : A n U n d e r g r a d u a t e R e s e a r c h J o u r n a l 2 0 0 476 ten years following its independence. This nding conrms the willingness of France to develop its ter - ritories, in contrast to the gradual detachment of the British from theirs. Finally , Portuguese colonies ap - peared unaffected by independence. This is most likely due to their initial low economic performance. PREDICTING INDEPENDENCE The predicted values obtained from the IV-Instrument regressions are also helpful in terms of ascer - taining which RDs are most likely to become independent. In 1975, most RDs were not likely to declare independence. On average the probability that an RD will gain independence amounted to 17%, about 10% lower than that of the average NIS, and the likelihood of gaining sovereignty for some RDs, such as the British Virgin Islands and Bermuda, was less than 1%. Nevertheless, a few RDs appeared quite vulnerable to the selection process. The Cook Islands and four French territories-French Polynesia, Guadeloupe, Martinique, and Reunion-had more than a 30% chance of gaining independence during this period, led by Martinique with a 58% chance. Today , the predicted value coefcients indicate that the strategic value of most RDs has changed. Most RDs are not likely to gain independence in the near future. On the one hand, the French territories' chances of becoming independent declined to less than 5%. New Caledonia's likelihood of becoming independent amounts to less than 1%. The reason is that my dataset does not include an instrument \"conflict\" variable, which would show increases in the costs associated with the metropolises' retention of their colonies. T wo territories, however, Montserrat and Puerto Rico, display much higher chances of becoming in - dependent. Montserrat's chances of gaining sovereignty approximate 55% in 2000, compared with 4.2% in 1985 and 15% in 1990. Likewise, Puerto Rico's independence likelihood rose from 14.2% in 1985 to 17.3% in 1990 to 32% in 2000, according to the probit regression model. Puerto Rico's large and growing population is not unaware of this likelihood. Montserrat's situation is also interesting since the frequent eruptions of the volcano, Soufri\u00e8re, have recently made half of the island uninhabitable and increased the United Kingdom's emergency aid costs. In brief, these two territories are especially vulnerable to the selection process today . Conclusion Both qualitative and quantitative analyses identify four key ndings. First, the territories' colonial value has evolved over time, and second, they are vulnerable to the metropolises' selection process. After the independence of big territories such as India and The Congo, many small island-territories lost much of their colonial value. Since then, the metropolitan powers have \"cherry-picked\" the better territories for continued aid and dependence, letting the others go. RDs were already richer back before 1970- that is, before the wave of independence for microstates-thanks to some inherent economic advantages. Moreover, the empirical analysis points out that a 1% loss in per capita income leads to a 1.23% increase in the probability of a territory reaching a higher degree of autonomy . In sum, today's overseas territories, especially Montserrat and Puerto Rico, must pay attention to their strategic value in order to uphold their dependency status, if they wish to remain dependent. Third, when accounting for the territories' initial economic performance, the effects of indepen - dence vary according to the ways metropolises developed their colonies. Only France has shown signi - cant interest in retaining its hold upon its territories. The convincing economic performances of France's RDs suggest the likelihood that these territories both were initially strong and have been well developed. In the future, the French territories are the most likely to remain dependent. On the other hand, other metropolises such as the United Kingdom have been more reluctant to exercise their colonial respon - sibilities. Consequently , for a British territory , independence is associated with an 11% increase in per capita income, whereas the economic growth rates of newly independent French territories suffered 50% E x p l o r a t i o n s : A n U n d e r g r a d u a t e R e s e a r c h J o u r n a l 2 0 0 4Selectivity and the Economics of Independence for Today's Overseas Territories 77 drops and those of newly independent Portuguese territories remained almost unaffected in the ten years following independence. However, on average, becoming independent no longer has a signicant impact on a territory's economic performance. This means that the RDs' inherent economic advantages have also contributed to today's income discrepancy between RDs and NISs and that there are both gains and losses associated with independence for territories. On the one hand, NISs suffer from the reduced opportunity of their populations to migrate to metropolises, from the drop in the condence of foreign investors, and from the loss of the \"territory's nancial advantages.\" On the other hand, NISs gradually become more self-reli - ant and benet from more diversied foreign aid sources and from the elimination of the Dutch Disease effects, which could negatively affect RDs in the future. Evidently , the extent to which a territory gains or loses from becoming independent depends on how well the metropolis developed it. This analysis has set the foundation for a solid comparison of RDs' and NISs' economies, allowing for precise and complete predictions regarding the independence of today's overseas territories. Similar analyses should be conducted within the next decade to analyze whether the NISs' recent economic revival will outweigh the costs associated with independence, and to challenge Samuel Cohen's (2003) prediction that, \"50 to 75 additional quasi- or fully independent states over the coming few decades\" will emerge, including \"the twenty-one colonial areas most likely to attain independence soon\" (p. 54-55).

College graduates hold the majority of America's prestigious and high-status career positions. College graduates also make most of America's important decisions regarding social, economic, and legislative issues. Today , more people are attending college than in any past decade. With an increasing number of people enrolling in college, it is crucial to know how college affects students. The public often assumes that college liberalizes students. If this assumption proves true, the liberal bias that students acquire could have lasting effects on society because of the decision-making power college graduates have in American society . Thus, it is important to know college attendees' value systems upon entry into college, the changes those systems undergo, and the factors that most affect those changes. While politicians, educators, and parents have both positive and negative views about the \"liberal\" bias in higher education, all feel that students are directly influenced by liberal college environments (e.g., Fish, 2004; Horowitz, 2004). Yet, prior research provides little evidence to conrm that all students actually experience liberalization because of college. Even if we accept the conclusion, however, past research has generally not taken into account students' experiences before college. Nor has it sufciently examined the process by which the purported liberalization takes place, nor the characteristics associated with change in student attitudes. Research on college students' views has tended to concentrate more on a particular view in regard to a single issue, rather than on the constellation of views and general political orientation and what they portend. While I concur with the popular view that college fosters liberal ideals, I do not agree with the as - sumption that college liberalizes all students. In my research, I focused on attitudinal change during the freshman year in college, as a way of examining the foundation for change that may be established and then built upon or torn down during the remaining college years. I hypothesized that few students enter college as conservative and that the majority of students enter as liberal. I hypothesized that students experience an entrenchment of values during the rst year of college\u2014what I call \"The Entrenchment Hypothesis.\" This hypothesis suggests that liberal students comfortably assimilate to collegiate environ - ments and become more liberal because college provides them with positive reinforcement for their Kathleen Patricia Feehan E x p l o r a t i o n s : A n U n d e r g r a d u a t e R e s e a r c h J o u r n a l 2 0 0 488 views. In contrast, conservative students must continually defend their views to peers and professors during college, thereby influencing them not only to reject liberalism but also to grow increasingly con - servative. Finally , college affects students who enter college with moderate views in one of three ways: 1) they embrace liberalism and experience similar increases in liberal views as do students who arrive at college as liberals; or 2) they reject the liberal environment and become more conservative, like the students who entered college as conservatives; or 3) they fail to change appreciably . In this study , I investigate whether factors such as gender, race and ethnicity , academic major, per - ceived family income, and parents' levels of education are associated with college students' initial val - ues, and the extent to which the freshman year in college influences change in students' values. While prior studies have looked at these factors and their associations with students' attitudes, I wanted to test whether such associations are statistically signicant. I focused on rst-year students because prior research (e.g., Heath, 1968; Loeb and Magee, 1992), indicates that freshmen are particularly prone to influences from their new university environment. Prior Research Research on the college experience and students' views has traditionally focused on single top - ics, as opposed to evaluating more broadly the influence of the college experience on student attitudes (Weakliem, 2002). Weakliem found that most prior research does not assess people's general views re - garding their levels of education. For example, research by Pascarella, Edison, Nora, Hagedorn, and Terenzini (1996) concentrates specically on freshman university students' opinions about diversity is - sues. Their ndings conrmed that students immersed in the university environment (i.e., those who were living on campus, participating in extracurricular activities, and actively engaging in relationships with their university peers) experienced a statistically signicant increase during their rst year in their level of openness to diversity issues. Because their research concentrated solely on diversity issues, how - ever, one cannot apply their ndings to general opinions and value systems. Prior to Pascarella et al. (1996), Heath (1968) studied freshman students and found that the fresh - man year, perhaps even the rst few months, was particularly important in attitude change. Loeb and Magee (1992) also concluded that much of the change in political views occurs in the rst semester of college. I built on this research by measuring the specic factors associated with students' attitudes at the beginning of and during college. In this study , I dene liberal ideas as those that favor progress, reform, and political, gender, and social equality . Liberalism questions existing social and institutional arrangements such as the economic, criminal justice, and military systems (Eitzen, 1979). In contrast, conservatism promotes the status quo and tradition in the economic, social, and political orders. Conservatives see individuals, not institutions or society , as responsible for their status (Eitzen, 1979). Early studies in sociology found that American college students were conservative and remained homogeneous (Jacobs, 1957). While this may have been true in the 1950s, popular media today would have us believe that college liberalizes students (Hanson, 2003; Slanaker, 2003). Some empirical research supports this view; Weakliem (2002), for example, found that higher levels of education are associated with liberal political opinions on a variety of issues ranging from civil liberties and rights of minority groups to gender roles. If Weakliem is correct, then it is plausible that highly educated parents promote liberalism in their children. Additional research (e.g., Feldman and Newcomb, 1969; Astin, 1977; Kayne, 1978; and Lottes and Kuriloff, 1994) supports the notions that students' opinions change and that college liberalizes people. Specic reasons for this shift include \"the absence of parents, new experiences, the exposure to a wide range of persons and ideas and peer pressures\" (Eitzen, 1979, p. 123). Pascarella and Terenzini (1991) E x p l o r a t i o n s : A n U n d e r g r a d u a t e R e s e a r c h J o u r n a l 2 0 0 4Freshmen Political Orientation 89 also found that students' opinions change during college and that the changes are the \"cumulative result of a set of interrelated experiences sustained over an extended period of time\" (p. 610). Thus, individuals who stay enrolled in college for extensive periods of time are likely to experience changes in opinions based on the university environment. Aside from experiences, personal characteristics such as gender, race and ethnicity also influence the development of college students' opinions (Vogelsesang, 2001). Dey (1996) and Sax and Arredondo (1999) conclude that, in addition to these factors, family income and parents' education are also related to political development. While much research evaluates race and gender separately , it is important to look at the interplay between these factors. If college affects students differently based on race, ethnic - ity , and gender, it is essential to compare men's and women's opinions within racial and ethnic groups (Vogelsesang, 2001). RACE AND ETHNICITY, GENDER AND SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS Research shows that, in addition to race, ethnicity is an important factor when evaluating college students' attitudes, because people of the same race but different ethnic groups may have far different experiences (Vogelsesang, 2001). Regarding gender, various scholars conclude that females have more liberal ideas than males (Vogelgesang, 2001; Dey , 1996; Loeb and Magee, 1992). These ndings contrast with early 20th century research, where Nelson (1938) found that females were more conservative than males. Perhaps the differences are related to the 1960s women's and civil rights movements. Dey's research (1996) on socioeconomic background shows conflicting views with respect to the effects of education and social class on individual attitudes and values. Dey (1996) found that coming from a \"well-to-do\" family is associated with higher levels of conservatism, while higher levels of parental education are associated with higher levels of liberalism among college students. Views on afrmative action are another marker of one's liberalism or conservatism. Children of par - ents who have higher levels of income and education are more likely to want to end afrmative action.1 The one exception is African Americans. African Americans who have higher levels of education and income are less likely to oppose afrmative action than are others in the same economic bracket (Sax and Arredondo, 1990). Whites tend to have opinions on afrmative action that are more conservative than those of non-whites, perhaps because whites have less to gain and more to lose with implementation of afrmative action practices. Compared with whites, non-whites seem to have the most to gain from the implementation of afrmative action practices, especially high-achieving African Americans who are in a position within society to benet the most from afrmative action practices (Sax and Arredondo, 1990). Overall, African Americans exhibit more liberal ideals than other non-whites and whites (Vogelgesang, 2001). FACULTY AND ACADEMIC MAJOR In addition to factors such as socioeconomic background, race, ethnicity , and extracurricular activi - ties, the level of faculty interaction with students has been suggested as a possible influence on student attitudes (Vogelsesang, 2001). Additionally , Astin (1993) found that differences in student attitudes were associated with different academic majors. This followed Eitzen's (1979) research that the social sciences tend to focus on issues that may influence students to question their identities-issues such as social inequality , gender roles and individual culpability . For example, liberal professors who teach sociology courses may \"persuade a signicant portion of students toward the political left\" (Eitzen, 1979, p. 123). Course curricula and pedagogical practice in the social science disciplines encourage student discussion, with liberal faculty facilitating discussion and providing empirical data that call into question traditional theories about topics such as juvenile crime and social welfare (Eitzen, 1979). Eitzen (1979) found that, Kathleen Patricia Feehan E x p l o r a t i o n s : A n U n d e r g r a d u a t e R e s e a r c h J o u r n a l 2 0 0 490 in introductory sociology classes, the opinions of 71 percent of the students shifted in a liberal direc - tion.2 On the other hand, the engineering and the science elds rely more on \"factual\" knowledge, and therefore students are less likely to question their identity or society and more likely to regard authority as being \"right\" and \"having the answers\" (Vogelsesang, 2001). Since students in the engineering and science elds have less exposure than social science students to courses that influence them to question social inequities or personal views, their views are less likely to shift as a result of their academic major. Despite these influences, however, faculty influence tends to be smaller and more indirect than peer influence. Dey (1996) concluded that attributing liberalization in students' views to faculty interac - tion might be \"at best imprecise and at worst misleading,\" as faculty-facilitated discussion occurs in the company of one's student peers, a setting in which the students' ideas form the bulk of the discussion (p. 551). None of this research, however, answers the even more fundamental question of whether majors affect students' attitudes or attitudes influence the students' choice of major. Despite the ndings that a student's gender, race and ethnicity , family income, parents' levels of education, and academic major may influence his or her opinions, prior research has not specically ex - amined college students' political opinions regarding these specic factors, nor has it assessed the influ - ence of students' political opinions upon entry into college. This is where my research differs: my study assessed the factors associated with students' initial political orientations and changes in attitudes during the rst year of college, and my ndings\u2014as well as, my \"Entrenchment Hypothesis\"\u2014provide a deeper understanding of attitudinal change among freshmen. Data To evaluate the \"Entrenchment Hypothesis,\" I surveyed subjects on their political views shortly after they arrived on campus, and again after they had been on campus for approximately ve months. Respondents selected for this study , which took place in the 2003-2004 academic year, were rst-year students at the University of California, Davis who were living on campus and who were over the age of 18 as of October 2003. The University of California at Davis is in a small college town in Northern California. The University , a land grant institution with a strong emphasis on agriculture, has a large student population, enrolling about 23,500 undergraduates and 4,270 graduate students annually . It is a residential campus and attracts students from both urban and rural communities. With the assistance of the University's Student Affairs Research and Information Department (SARI), I drew a random sample of students from the 2003-2004 freshman class. I limited the sample to students over the age of 18 to avoid the additional step of gaining parental consent, something that may have reduced the response rate and delayed the data gathering; I also lim - ited the sample to freshmen living in residence halls. Although these restrictions may have increased the selectivity of my sample, they provided several benets. First, they made it easy to track the sample popu - lation, because student housing notied me of address changes, whether the subject had merely moved to a new residence hall or room or had stopped attending school altogether. A second benet accrues to the fact that, when controlling for the influence of various predictors, living on-campus, in residence halls, is one of among only a few variables that has been shown to have a signicant effect on student attitudes (Pascarella et al., 1996). Residence halls typically provide an environment where students are more susceptible to influence and more likely to experience changes in opinion (Astin, 1993), because they are exposed to diversity on a scale that they have not experienced previously as they interact with peers who are different from themselves (Pascarella et al., 1996).3 While not all hall residents interact in peer groups to the same degree, another benet to limiting the sample to this population is the greater likelihood that students will interact more widely with a diverse E x p l o r a t i o n s : A n U n d e r g r a d u a t e R e s e a r c h J o u r n a l 2 0 0 4Freshmen Political Orientation 91 group of peers. Students may self-select to live in residence halls that limit their exposure to peers dif - ferent from themselves\u2014for example, by living in themed residence halls according to gender, cultural interests or academic interests (e.g., Chicano/Latino, Biological Sciences, Communications, etc). But even the peer group in these themed dorms is likely to be more diverse than that within their families and home communities. INSTRUMENT DEVELOPMENT The surveys examined participants' attitudes and beliefs on a variety of subjects (similar to Sax and Lindholm, 2002, and Weakliem, 2002). Many of the survey items are borrowed from the General Social Survey (GSS). When formulating my survey items, I used some GSS items verbatim and modied the wording of others. The surveys used a ve point Likert scale for 12 close-ended items to measure peoples' levels of agreement or disagreement with statements on issues ranging across the environment, gender roles, homosexuality , pre-marital cohabitation, afrmative action, capital punishment, marijuana legal - ization, and government spending. Examples of such statements are, \"Marijuana should be made legal\" and \"People convicted of murder should be subject to the death penalty .\" This information was used to place the subjects on a conservative-moderate-liberal continuum. In addition to the attitude questionnaire, I asked participants about their gender, race and ethnicity , perceived household income during high school, and mother's and father's levels of education. As I had done with the GSS, when formulating the background questionnaire I used or slightly modied items from the 2000 Census. SURVEY DISTRIBUTION AND FOLLOW-UP To obtain a high response rate, I followed Dillman's (1978) \"Total Design Method\" (TDM) for self- report mail surveys. Dillman (1978) advises that providing research subjects with personalized letters, pre-addressed/stamped envelopes, clear denitions of the study's purposes, and easy accessibility to the researcher(s) effectively increases response rates. I sent each sample subject a hand-signed letter of intro - duction on university letterhead, requesting his or her assistance in the study , and the research subjects protocol consent materials developed by the University's Ofce of Human Research Protection. To evaluate whether freshman students' political orientations changed over their rst months in college, I distributed the same survey twice, shortly after subjects had arrived on campus and then again after approximately ve months.4 I had originally planned to distribute the survey before the students arrived on campus; however, due to a delay in the review of my survey by the University Human Subjects Committee, I distributed the rst set of survey materials in the fall of 2003, approximately six and a half weeks after freshmen had arrived at the University . This delay in contacting students may have had an influence on the study results. First, because it was mid-quarter, students may have been overwhelmed with academic course work and/or other commitments and may have been less willing to ll out the survey than they would have been earlier in the academic term. Second, the opinions expressed by the students during the rst distribution of the attitude survey could have been affected by their rst six weeks at college. If either of these is true, the survey results will understate the magnitude of the change in students' opinions early in their undergraduate careers. I sent follow-up letters to non-respondents two weeks after the initial contact, asking them to ll out the survey and consent forms, and emailed the non-respondents after the tenth week of the quarter requesting that they ll out the forms and survey . I also provided the subjects with a link to download the consent forms, background questionnaire and survey from the Internet. I distributed the winter survey approximately four months and one week after students had arrived on campus. The winter survey targeted only those who had responded to the rst survey . I sent reminder Kathleen Patricia Feehan E x p l o r a t i o n s : A n U n d e r g r a d u a t e R e s e a r c h J o u r n a l 2 0 0 492 email messages to non-respondents three weeks later. Three weeks after emailing them, I mailed an ad - ditional survey and pre-addressed, stamped envelope to each remaining non-respondent. The retention rate was 94% (only eight people left the study); all participants returned survey number two by approxi - mately ve and half months after they had arrived on campus. Data Analysis I evaluated the surveys using STATA statistical analysis software. The surveys' 12 close-ended items were recoded so that high scores indicated more liberal attitudes and low scores indicated more conserva - tive attitudes. Individual items were scored from one to ve and then summed across the twelve items. A score of 12 indicated the most conservative orientation and 60 the most liberal. Scores of respondents' levels of agreement with liberal statements meant the following: 1) conservative (score of 12-30); 2) moderate (score of 31-41); 3) or liberal (score of 42-60). The total attitude scale had a Cronbach's alpha score of about 0.78, indicating that the survey reliably evaluated respondents' political orientations. Of the subjects contacted initially , one hundred thirty-one participated, producing a response rate of 44%.5 The majority of respondents (approximately 55%) identied their parental income as above average. Additionally , there were more female (61.5%) than male (38.5%) respondents. While overrepre - sentation of females in social science survey research is common, this fact may have affected the study's results and generalizability . Eight respondents were not included in the analyses because they failed to complete the questionnaire. I performed bivariate and multivariate regression analyses to test factors associated with respon - dents' attitudes. Regressions measure the likelihood of an outcome (in this case, students' political at - titudes) based on specic variables-for example, the general political attitudes that female respondents hold compared with those of male respondents during fall quarter. The coefcient for female indicates: a) whether the association between female respondents and political attitudes is statistically signicant; and b) what political attitudes female respondents are likely to have compared with male respondents (i.e., more conservative or more liberal). Since academic major was the only empirical factor with which Student Affairs Research and Information provided me for all 300-sample subjects, I wanted to assess whether subjects' majors cor - related with their decision to respond or not. I found that subjects' majors were not associated with whether or not they participated in the study (Table 1, Appendix 1). If I had found that students with certain majors were statistically more likely to respond than students with other majors, I would have concluded that the sample was less representative of the freshman class. The rst survey indicated that 9% of respondents were conservative (average score, 29.7); 37% were moderate (ave. score, 38.2); and about 54% were liberal (ave. score, 42.2). I evaluated whether there was a correlation in my sample between the factors that researchers had previously associated with students' political orientations and changes in political orientations.6 Neither mothers' nor fathers' educational levels were associated with the respondents' initial politi - cal views (Table 3, Appendix 1). These ndings are inconsistent with the work of Sax and Arrededando (1999), which concluded that the levels of education of students' parents were associated with students' political orientations. They also contrast with Dey's (1996) notion that people who have parents with higher levels of education are more likely to have liberal views. Respondents' initial views were not associated with respondents' perceived levels of income as prov - en by the large standard error (Table 3). This nding contrasts with Dey's (1996) conclusion that income is related to differences in political orientation of college students. Also in contrast to Dey (1996), as well as Nelson (1958), Vogelgesang (2001), and Loeb and Magee (1992), a respondent's gender did not have a statistically signicant association with his or her initial attitudes (Table 3). E x p l o r a t i o n s : A n U n d e r g r a d u a t e R e s e a r c h J o u r n a l 2 0 0 4Freshmen Political Orientation 93 I wanted to assess not only perceived income levels, but also the relationship between students' socioeconomic status and political orientation. When comparing attitudes across socioeconomic status, the analyses reveal that no factor was associated with respondents' initial values (Table 3). This nding contrasts with Sax and Arredando's (1991) assertion that a person's socioeconomic status is associated with his or her political views.7 I also found that a respondent's race and ethnicity were not associated with his or her political values (Table 3), a nding that contrasts with Sax and Arredondo's (1990) conclusion that whites have more conservative views than non-whites. This nding is limited, however, by this study's small sample size, which did not include many non-whites or non-Asians. Compared with those students who were engineering majors, respondents with other academic majors did not have statistically signicant associations with certain views (Table 3). When evaluating political orientation, I found no statistically signicant relationships among gender, race and ethnicity , perceived income, academic major, and parents' levels of education (Table 3). This is consistent with Nelson's (1957) early research and contrasts with more recent research in sociology (see Vogelgesang, 2001; Dey , 1996; and Loeb and Magee, 1992). Figure 1 (Appendix 2) shows respondents' attitudes during fall and winter on two separate smooth curves. The curves shows that, while respondents had slightly more conservative attitudes in winter than in fall, attitudes did not change appreciably over the span of this study . Nevertheless, it was important to assess whether the shifts in respondent's views were statistically signicant. A p-value of less than 0.10 means the relationship/association (in this case, a shift in attitudes) is statistically signicant. While re - spondents' attitudes during winter were consistent with respondents' attitudes during fall, the shifts in values were not statistically signicant, as documented by the large p value of 0.7306 (Table 4). In summary , the test suggests that, when compared with a person's initial political orientation as conservative, moderate or liberal, shifts in attitudes were not statistically signicant. Perhaps students were affected by their rst six weeks of college and their initial responses to the rst survey measured those influences, thus impairing the ability to measure the difference between initial and changed politi - cal values, or perhaps the time between the survey distributions was not long enough to gain statistically signicant observations. CHANGES IN ATTITUDE The political orientation of the 116 remaining members of the sample who responded to all items on the winter survey was on average moderately liberal, with a score of about 42.8 Respondents to the winter survey had average attitude scores of 29.8 (approximately 9%), 38.1 (38%) and 42.1 (53%) for Conservatives, Moderates, and Liberals, respectively . Thus, attitudes during winter tended to be generally consistent with respondents' initial (fall) attitudes. If my \"Entrenchment Hypothesis\" held true, respondents' attitudes would have polarized based on their initial attitudes. For example, a respondent with an attitude score of 20 during the fall would be expected to have a score lower than 20 during winter. For all conservative respondents, I would expect the average attitude score to decrease during winter, cumulatively making the slope for conservative re - spondents' attitudes less than one when comparing fall and winter attitudes. Comparing fall and winter attitudes for moderates would not be expected to yield extreme changes. Comparing liberal respondents' views would be expected to yield winter attitude scores greater than those in fall. My ndings, however, show that no matter what the respondents' initial orientations, their values shifted to the more conser - vative, as illustrated by the slope values of less than one.9 However, the shifts were different based on a subject's initial political orientation (Table 4). Those with conservative initial values shifted the most and those with liberal initial values shifted the least.Kathleen Patricia Feehan E x p l o r a t i o n s : A n U n d e r g r a d u a t e R e s e a r c h J o u r n a l 2 0 0 494 Figure 2 (Appendix 2) shows predicted values for the follow-up survey based on respondents' initial values. The line illustrates respondents' predicted attitudes during winter based on their attitudes for fall, but does not offer convincing support for my hypotheses of an entrenchment in values. The dots on Figure 1 illustrate respondents' attitudes during fall and during winter. Generally speaking, the actual attitudes of respondents are similar to the predicted values. A respondent's gender, race and ethnicity , perceived income, and academic major could not be asso - ciated with change in attitudes (Table 5). These ndings differ from previous research on changes in atti - tude as they relate to parents' levels of education (Dey , 1996; Astin, 1993). Regarding academic major, this nding may be consistent with Dey's (1996) assertion that major has limited influence on people's opinions. While perceived income was not associated with shifts in values, the coefcients show signs of fol - lowing Dey (1996) and Sax and Arrendondo's (1992) ndings that people with higher levels of income are likely to become more liberal during college, and people with average and lower income levels are likely to become more conservative. Perhaps if I had measured respondents' actual income levels, I would have gained more reliable ndings regarding respondents' income levels and changes in attitude. GENDER Although a respondent's gender was not associated with a statistically signicant change in attitude, there was an association between being female and a shift toward liberalism. This nding coincides with those by Vogelgesang (2001), Dey (1996), and Loeb and Magee (1992), but contrasts with Nelson's (1958) earlier nding that females' attitudes became increasingly conservative during college when com - pared with the attitude change in their male peers. (Again, this difference may be attributable to the influ - ence of the women's movement.) PARENTAL LEVEL OF EDUCATION When evaluating respondents' shifts in attitudes in terms of their parents' levels of education, inde - pendent of other variables, I did nd a statistically signicant association. The views of respondents who had mothers with some college or post-baccalaureate education shifted toward conservatism, regardless of their fathers' level of education. Although not statistically signicant, parents' educational levels seem to be associated with shifts in views (Table 5). Respondents with mothers who had at least some college were associated with con - servative shifts in political orientation, while respondents with mothers who had no college (a category encompassing those who had no schooling whatsoever up to those with a high school degree) were likely to be associated with liberal shifts in opinion. A father's level of education had the opposite association on political orientation: respondents with fathers who had at least some college were likely to be associated with shifts toward liberal political opinions, whereas respondents with fathers who had no college were likely to develop more conservative views over time. PARENTAL LEVEL OF EDUCATION AND INCOME In evaluating respondents' shifts in opinion in terms of socioeconomic status, I controlled for re - spondents' perceived income levels and fathers' levels of education; respondents with mothers who had at least some college were associated with change in a conservative direction (Table 5). Although not statistically signicant, when controlling for respondents' perceived income levels and mothers' levels of education, my research found that those with fathers who had at least some college showed signs of attitude change toward the liberal end of the spectrum. These patterns are quite interesting in light of previous research ndings that women tend to be more E x p l o r a t i o n s : A n U n d e r g r a d u a t e R e s e a r c h J o u r n a l 2 0 0 4Freshmen Political Orientation 95 liberal (see Dey , 1996; Vogelgesang, 2001; Loeb and Magee, 1992). If women are more liberal, one would assume that mothers with a higher level of education influence liberal thought among their children. Not only is that association not found, but just the opposite occurs: respondents who had mothers with at least some college are associated with more conservative views than respondents with less educated mothers. Whether or not the mother had at least some college-level education was the only statistically signicant factor associated with respondents' changes in attitude; more specically , respondents who have mothers with at least some college are associated with shifts toward conservatism (Table 5). The same held true when evaluating respondents' perceived income levels, whether they saw their income level as below-average, average, or above-average. By contrast, respondents with fathers who have at least some college are associated with shifts toward liberalism when evaluating perceived income levels (Table 5). FACTORS WITH NO SIGNIFICANT ASSOCIATIONS: RACE AND ETHNICITY, ACADEMIC MAJOR This study did not nd any statistically signicant association between changes in respondents' attitudes, and their race and ethnicity or their academic major. Although not statistically signicant, at - titudes of respondent who identied as full Asian or non-white and non-Asian (e.g., African Americans, Hispanics) showed tendencies toward conservatism, compared with respondents who identied as white (Table 4). In concurrence with the ndings of Dey (1996) and in contrast to those of Astin (1993) and Vogelgesang (2001), when controlling for other variables, academic major was not associated with differ - ences in political shifts (Table 5). Discussion For this study it was important for a variety of reasons to evaluate family income, parental education, race and ethnicity , academic major, and gender as factors. For example, socioeconomic status is often dened in terms of education and income levels; I wanted to test the association between socioeconomic status and people's views, because people often assume that differences among social classes correspond with differences in attitudes (e.g., toward issues of social welfare and individual responsibility). In recent decades, the average American household income has decreased relative to the cost of living, while the number of people attending college has increased. The decrease in income levels and increase in educational levels make it essential to look at these factors not only collectively but also sepa - rately . Because the gap between the rich and the poor in America is widening, it is important to know how people's attitudes vary among different income levels. Since people who go to college tend to have parents who went to college, it is also imperative to look at the relationship between people's attitudes and their parents' levels of education. If people's attitudes are contingent on their parents' levels of educa - tion, differences in opinions or ideological gaps that seem to be based on socioeconomic level may actu - ally be more accurately related to education. While race relations in American society have improved greatly since the implementation of de - segregation laws, discrimination based on race and ethnicity still exists. If different racial and ethnic groups have dissimilar political opinions, it is important to learn about the experiences that influence such differences in opinion. Also, if shifts in students' attitudes differ among academic majors, it would be important to know whether the choice of academic major influences opinions, or conversely , whether people with certain attitudes are more drawn to certain academic majors. Finally , assessing the association between gender and political attitudes has many benets. Women's increased access to higher education and to the workforce in the past decades has certainly affected not only their individual personal experiences but the family structure in America as well (Hochschild, 1989). Perhaps these changes have influenced men's and women's political views differently , or perhaps Kathleen Patricia Feehan E x p l o r a t i o n s : A n U n d e r g r a d u a t e R e s e a r c h J o u r n a l 2 0 0 496 political views have been affected in a more uniform way , regardless of one's gender. If gender is a factor in such attitudinal changes, perhaps it is due to America's historically patriarchal society , and one must wonder why some views have been so resistant to change despite the transformation of social and family structure. LIMITATIONS While the response rate for this study is similar to response rates found in some social science re - search, and while the original sample for the study was representative of UC Davis freshman, I cannot be sure that those who chose to participate in the study responded in the same way as would those who were invited but decided not to participate. Also, the higher percentage of female respondents and the different racial/ethnic composition of the sample, compared with the demographics of the freshman class in general, make it impossible to generalize my ndings. Additionally , analyses that contained income level were contingent on the perceived rather than ac- tual incomes of respondents' families. Income may emerge as a more signicant factor if actual household income were used. Analyses involving race and ethnicity are also limited. Because of the small sample size, I was unable to include Vogelgesang's (2001) methodology of testing political orientations with respect to ethnic groups. The small sample size also may have affected analyses involving parents' levels of education, as I was not able to compare specic levels of education. Additionally , because information about academic major was obtained from respondents' original college applications and subjects were not surveyed on their academic major during each distribution of the survey , results do not reflect any changes of major that may have occurred prior to the study's completion. A more signicant limitation is that changes in attitudes during college do not necessarily mean that college itself is making the impact. Other factors-such as the political climate of society , or \"overall national trends\"-may influence such attitude changes (Wilder, Hoyt, Surbeck, and Wilder, 1986).10,11 Changes in political orientation of students during college could also result from normal maturation and not from the college's or even society's political climate, because the age of the average entering college student coincides with the stage of \"Early Adult Transition\" as described by Levinson, Darrow , Klein, Levinson, and McKee (1978), and is also very close to the time when people are revising their values and attitudes (McCrae and Costa, 1990). For example, when Rich (1977) compared changes in opinion between college and non-college groups, he found no difference between the groups in the amount of change; age may have effects that are distinct from cohort and period effects, ndings that should be ac - counted for in future research on the influence of college. This study's methodology can certainly be improved. To better examine change in political orienta - tion, it would be best to assess students' political views before they arrive on the university campus rather than weeks after, and later in the academic year instead of less than six months after their arrival. To bet - ter generalize the study's ndings to the sample population, researchers will want to achieve higher re - sponse rates. This could possibly be accomplished by using online surveys rather than mail-out surveys. In addition to doing quantitative analyses, including qualitative methodology could further benet the research design of studies involving freshman college students. Much prior research attributes students' attitude change primarily to faculty , extracurricular activities, and peers. Speaking to rst year university students would provide additional insight into these factors and allow researchers to evaluate the factors in greater depth. Because this study was limited to freshmen at one public university , I am unable to generalize my ndings to American college students. Further researchers should consider taking a representative na - tional sample of college students from both public and private universities, in order to evaluate political orientation among all American college students. However, because even a national sampling of college E x p l o r a t i o n s : A n U n d e r g r a d u a t e R e s e a r c h J o u r n a l 2 0 0 4Freshmen Political Orientation 97 freshmen would have limitations, further researchers might consider using Rich's (1977) research design by including both college and non-college students as a means of assessing the degree to which changes in attitude are contingent on college. Having a control group of non college-aged freshmen would allow scholars to measure people's political orientations and to determine whether college actually has any ef - fect on political views or whether political orientation trends are consistent for both cohorts. Because it would be challenging to obtain a nationally representative sample of college freshman, a study involving an evaluation of freshmen at a single university could be improved by having a larger sample size than 300 students. With regard to students' income levels, analyses could be improved by obtaining students' actual household income levels during high school instead of perceived income lev - els, especially since prior research has shown that people can incorrectly project their levels of income. Also, assessment of the association between a student's academic major and political orientation could be improved by surveying students on their academic majors during each distribution of the survey rather than merely using the academic major they declared on their college applications. This study's results partially substantiate the Entrenchment Hypothesis, in that students' attitudes shifted differently based on whether they were initially conservative, moderate or liberal. Conservative students became more conservative and moderates stayed almost the same. The fact that the association between fall and winter attitudes was not statistically signicant could be due to the small time frame (approximately four months) between the two survey distributions. This study shows that the evaluation of freshman students' opinions holds value. Despite the small time frame and relative homogeneity of respondents' characteristics, certain factors were associated with students' political orientations and changes in attitude over time. The nding that respondents who had mothers with at least some college became more conservative, compared with respondents whose moth - ers had no college, is entirely new and surprising and deserves further evaluation. Despite the fact that there are rarely ndings to support such a claim, the popular media as well as many prior researchers have highlighted the extensive liberalization that takes place during college. This study incorporated new methodology by assessing students' views on a continuum, and not merely ask - ing students to self-identify their political orientations as conservative/Republican or liberal/Democrat. This methodology has the advantage of allowing scholars to assess students' actual political orientations based on students' views on various issues. Never before have scholars in higher education research as - sessed college students' actual political orientations or evaluated the factors associated with changes in college students' political orientations. This study not only proves that we can assess students' views and chronicle changes, but also introduces a new hypothesis. Even if it turns out to be true that there is a dominant liberal climate in most college campuses today , the Entrenchment Hypothesis could help explain why , despite that climate, certain students maintain conservative viewpoints. Acknowledgments This study was made possible with the generous nancial support of the Presidential Undergraduate Fellowship Program of UC Davis. I would also like to thank my advisor, Eric Grodsky , for challenging, encouraging and inspiring me to be a good researcher. Notes 1. Though my study concentrates on general political attitudes, it is important to remember the events of October 2003 and February 2004 regarding specic topics. People may have thought more about afrmative action issues in fall 2003 because of Proposition 54 on California's ballot, which stated that gathering racial statistics would become illegal. Additionally , the highly publicized marriages of gay couples in San Francisco during winter 2004 may have influenced people to think about gay rights more than usual.

Eitzen (1979) surveyed Introductory to Sociology students about change of status quos, societal arrangements and attitudes toward individual and societal culpability for social problems. The surveys were administered on the rst day of class and again near the end of the course. The attrition rate of students was normal, consisting of students who dropped the course or were absent on the day of the second administration of the survey questionnaire. The study included professors with a range of orientations toward Sociology\u2014from extreme Marxists to functional-conflict theorists. 3. Pascarella et al.'s (1996) study did not analyze student opinions on various subjects; instead it concentrated on college students' attitudes with respect to diversity issues. 4. The fall survey included a background questionnaire, a survey , consent forms and a pre-addressed, stamped envelope to return research items to me. In winter quarter I sent students the same survey , a pre-addressed stamped envelope to return back to me, and copies of the participant's consent forms for his or her records. All survey results were kept condential, never to be associated with the participants' UC Davis records. 5. Three subjects left the University , and were considered \"non-respondents.\" 6. See Sax and Arredando (1999), Astin (1993), Loeb and Magee (1992), Eitzen (1979), Weakliem (2002), Dey (1996) and Vogelsesang (2001). The factors included gender, race and ethnicity , academic major, parents' levels of education (see Table 1 to view breakdown of these nominal variables) and perceived household income during high school (see Table 1 to view breakdown of these ordinal variables). 7. Sax and Arredando dened socioeconomic status in terms of parents' income and education levels. 8. In winter, 123 subjects responded to the survey , but seven were not included in the analyses because they chose not to ll out the entire survey . 9. A slope value of less than one means respondents' winter attitude scores were lower than their fall attitude scores, and thus more conservative. 10. See Hastings and Hoge's (1986) study on college men and their moral attitudes (e.g., about premarital sex, marijuana use and homosexuality), which showed a trend toward liberalization in male students' attitudes between 1948 and 1967, little change in opinions between 1967 and 1974, and a shift towar d conservatism between 1974 and 1984. 11. Wilder, Hoyt, Surbeck, Wilder & Carney (1986) found smaller gains in liberalism in students of the 1980s compared with students of the 1960s and 1970s. References Astin, Alexander W . (1977).

The impulse to explore brings with it a desire that is almost as powerful, to share the news of discovery with others. All of the essays in this volume, like those in previous volumes, have arisen from those same twin drives. Discoveries carry with them implications-some that can be anticipated, and others that cannot; some that are minor and have only limited effect, others that are more critical and possibly even global in scope. Some discoveries contribute positive and new knowledge, while others show the limitation or the error of previous ndings. Some will inspire new research, while others will motivate future researchers to nd limitations or errors in our current ways of thinking, methods of investigation, and guiding ques- tions or hypotheses. In one way or another, then, a discovery always constitutes a contribution. The questions that prompt discovery often cluster around different sets of issues and concerns that extend across disciplines. Whether small or large, discoveries arise within a context that is created by the parameters established by the set of questions being asked. Some ndings have a bearing on ques- tions of epistemology , while others deal with issues of methodology that, in turn, inform theoretical developments. If we envision knowledge as arising out of a dialectic between the two poles of discovery and theory , we can see that the issues and questions of one side end up framing the issues and questions for the other. These issues and questions constitute the paradigm within a discipline-and often across disciplines. Paradigms have boundaries that exist because of, and are enforced by , a discipline's accepted prac- tices and ways of thinking. The boundaries, however, are not absolute. Especially in the physical and natural sciences, they shift in response to new questions and new discoveries that cannot be addressed or understood within the con nes of the existing paradigm. Because of the nature of such shifts, the import of a discovery must await its appropriate moment. On occasion the contribution might not be recognized at the time in which the work was conducted. A case in point is the work on plant genetics originally done by Mendel in the late l850s and the early l860s. The implications of his ndings were only realized in the beginning of the twentieth century , at which time the kinds of paradigmatic questions regarding evolution had shifted from the original Darwinian emphasis on the physical features that orchestrate evolutionary change to the mechanisms through which these features work within populations. It was nearly forty years after Mendel's work-and twenty years after his death-that his discoveries were recognized for the critically important advance-ment they marked in the discipline of genetics. Only through a series of paradigmatic shifts could the prescient quality of Mendel's work be appreciated. The creation of generalizations and of different types of comparison constitutes yet another form of discovery . While the construction of theory may be a guiding force in the natural/physical sciences and in some of the social sciences, the practice of comparison and generalization is central to the social sciences and the humanities. Comparing detective stories through time and across national cultures, for example, helps explain why and how certain national traditions produce certain kinds of detectives and detective stories and not others. Generalization and comparison require that we view the discovery either against the backdrop of what is already known (e.g., asking whether a particular discovery is unique) or as the result of broader epistemologies and sociologies of knowledge. Discovery , generalization, comparison, and theory all relate to another critical issue that transcends the boundaries of what each discipline de nes as \"knowledge\" as well as the ways in which it arrives at and organizes that knowledge. Within each discipline's paradigm is an idea or vision of what constitutes iv its subject matter and of the relationship between its subject matter and the empirical evidence. The subject matter of a discipline sets forth its critical conceptual frameworks and theoretical constructs, while the empirical evidence is used to test theories and develop hypotheses. Freud, for example, argued that the mind in all its facets is the subject matter of psychology , while individual behavior constitutes the empirical evidence. At the same time, the understanding of the subject matter at any point in time de nes what is and is not considered to be \"evidence,\" as well as dictating the level and nature of the evidence required to either verify or falsify theories. Thus, along with the subject matter, the nature and understanding of the empirical evidence will change over time. Both poles in the dialectic between theory and discovery thereby de ne one another, inform the questions needed to validate knowledge, and regulate the kinds of analysis performed in the discipline. The development of an intellectual and epistemological foundation in any discipline, however, depends more on the totality of the formulation of the subject matter than it does on any individual piece or pieces of empirical evidence. In the physical and natural sciences, the distinction between the two might not be much of an issue, although paradigmatic changes will and do bring forth new or different subject matters. But in the social sciences, the distinction is more critical and has greater relevance to the work done by researchers in those areas. More often than not, the contrast is blurred, poorly de ned, and misinterpreted. Throughout the social sciences, the confl ation of the unit of observation with the object of analysis brings to mind an analogy that Noam Chomsky employed in Language and Mind (1968), that calling psychology a behavioral science is akin to calling physics a science of meter reading. As subject matters change and the empirical evidence becomes richer, the human ability to devise vast and highly complex theories of scienti c enquiry , to use metaphor and rhetoric in ways that are both more nuanced and more aware of language's implications, and to usher in new aesthetic develop-ments and criteria for quality in art, music and literature all attest to the creativity and the richness of the human mind. Developments of this type are the pinnacles of growth, imagination and thought as mapped by a culture's mental logic. It is this creativity that led James Thurber to utter his famous dic-tum, \"The noblest study of mankind is man-says man.\" It is this creativity also that gives rise to each of the six essays in this volume.

Aram Yengoyan Professor of AnthropologyFaculty Assistant to the Vice Provost-Undergraduate StudiesExplorations: An Undergraduate Research Journal 2003Philip Marlowe: American Detective Christine Coit Introduction: A Brief History of Detection Edgar Allan Poe is often credited with writing the rst modern detective story , thereby launching a genre that has been popular ever since. One could just as easily say , however, that he wrote three stories that highlighted the extraordinary talents of his proto-detective, Auguste Dupin. In \"Murders in Marie Roget\" (1842-43), and \"The Purloined Letter\" (1844), Poe established a number of standards that his successors in the genre\u2014particularly those of the British school\u2014have more or less observed over time. 1 The amateur detective who works by the deductive method, the less-astute sidekick, and the detective as an eccentric mastermind all derive from Poe's sto-ries. British, or classic, detective ction followed from Poe's stories, and developed its own conventions. These include a relatively closed setting where crime is not the norm, composed of a homogeneous selec-tion of \"privileged characters,\" a number of suspects whose guilt seems plausible, and a plot that devel-ops so that the nal revelation of the murderer is a surprise to characters and readers alike (Grella 103). While Poe may have founded a genre, he did not create the story of detection. Since the beginnings of literary history , authors have employed the conventions that are at the core of modern detective c- tion. For example, in Sophocles' Oedipus Rex , Oedipus can be seen as \"a detective as gifted and dogged as Holmes himself, [set] out to investigate one crime, the murder of King Laius\" (Byrd 73). W . H. Auden, who, in his 1948 essay \"The Guilty Vicarage,\" draws a distinct line between the high art of ancient tragedy and the non-art of detective ction, admits comparisons between the two when he outlines three shared elements: concealment (\"the innocent seem guilty and the guilty seem innocent\"), manifestation (\"the real guilt is brought to consciousness\") and peripeteia (the \"reversal from apparent guilt to innocence\" and vice versa) (147). Through time, these elements became part of the detective story's \"mechanical form\" (Byrd 75). Thus, while Poe may have set the standard for detective ction, many of the elements that he employed nd their origins in earlier literary works. It was not until the 1920s and 1930s that writers began to attempt any radical departure from the conventions that Poe established. Prohibition, gangsterism, and the Great Depression gave birth to what later became known as the hard-boiled detective novel. In The Perfect Murder: A Study in Detection , David Lehman best captures the look and feel of the \"mean streets\" that characterize the genre: \"a chiaroscuro world of dark angles and elongated shadows, rained-on streets on which a solitary walker pauses to light his cigarette and a fl ickering neon sign punctuates night. A shot rings out: there is the sound of footsteps Explorations: An Undergraduate Research Journal 20038Christine Coit hurled down stairs, and then all is silence again: in the fl eabag hotel room where the dead man lies, a gauze curtain rustles lazily in its high open window. Silence; and then a scream\" (136). This distinctly American genre created not only a newer, tougher world in which its detective would operate, but a new-er, tougher type of detective as well (Chandler, \"Simple Art\" 18). 2 Instead of the eccentric mastermind, a more frank, cynical, sharp-edged, and street-wise private investigator emerged. The hard-boiled school was seen by readers as an accurate portrayal of American life, drawing its materials from a nation \"populated by real criminals and real policemen.\" The stories \"[refl ected] some of the tensions of the time,\" were \"endowed with considerable narrative urgency , and [were] imbued with the disenchantment peculiar to postwar American writing\" (Grella 105). For those reasons, hard-boiled detective ction is a distinctly American genre, yielding distinctly American heroes and villains. In many ways, the style that characterized the hard-boiled detective novel, with its \"tough realis- tic surface and ... highly sensational content,\" owes its heritage to pulp magazines (Grella 104). These magazines, showcasing stories of adventure, targeted readers who \"did not want uplift or information; they wanted to kill time with a good read and above all they wished to be taken away from the realities of their own lives and to have a touch of adventure and romance\" (MacShane 44). Writers for the pulps needed to grasp their readers' attention from beginning to end, a duty that left little room for gratuitous literary effects. In addition, writers were restricted by the limited education of their readers. Due to these constraints, hard-boiled pulp writers often rejected the constricting conventions of English detection, exchanging \"the static calm, the intricate puzzle, [and] the ingenious deductions\" for stories \"characterized by rapid action, colloquial language, emotional impact, and the violence that pervades American ction\" (Grella 104). Unlike English detection, which was concerned, in Raymond Chandler's assessment, with \"the upper classes, the week-end house party and the vicar's rose garden,\" the hard-boiled writers \"gave [murder] back to the people who commit it for reasons, not just to provide a corpse\" (Chandler, \"Simple Art\" 14, qtd. in MacShane 47-8). Although most pulp writers have been dismissed by critics as \"hack writers,\" whose works, in W . H. Auden's words, \"have nothing to do with works of art,\" some, such as Raymond Chandler, used pulp magazines as an apprenticeship, eventually graduating and moving on (Auden 147; \"Pulp Magazine\" 688). Indeed, Chandler uses detective ction-exploiting its conventions and enlarging its scope-as the mold from which he creates his art. Although every story contains a murder and a detective who sets out to solve the crime, the mystery is merely the vehicle for the principal theme, the canvas upon which Chandler works. Chandler's major concern is with human misery , a theme that, as Philip Durham notes in his introduction to Chandler's Killer in the Rain , is at the heart of what is thought of as \"'serious' litera- ture\" (xii). 3 The Library of America's publication of two volumes containing seven of Chandler's novels, thirteen of his short stories, a screenplay , and selected essays and letters, can be seen as an of cial en- dorsement of Chandler's status as an important American author as well as a tacit acceptance of detective and crime ction into the canon of American literature. Raymond Chandler Often cited as one of the nest prose writers of the twentieth century , Raymond Chandler trans- formed hard-boiled detective ction from simple escape literature into an accepted literary art form. Detective ction was not Chandler's rst foray into writing. Chandler had experimented in verse, essays, and sketches long before his rst detective story; however, this earlier writing did not equal the skill and pro ciency of his novels. Out of nancial necessity , Chandler began his career as a writer. After reading popular pulp magazines, he decided that he could easily imitate the ction they showcased, as well as be paid to learn how to do so. Following the credo \"analyze and imitate; no other school is necessary ,\" Explorations: An Undergraduate Research Journal 20039Philip Marlowe: American Detective Chandler began to write in the style he observed from these magazines (Chandler, Selected Letters 279; hereafter cited as Letters ). Chandler cited many infl uences, including Dashiell Hammett, Ernest Hemingway , Ring Lardner, Carl Sandburg, and Sherwood Anderson (Chandler, \"Simple Art\" 14). Nevertheless, his use of language distinguishes him from his antecedents. Born in America and raised in England, Chandler had to learn American English almost as a separate dialect. Refl ecting his upbringing, Chandler's ction is a curious blend of the British and the American: a distinct combination of British descriptions and prose with American speech and dialogue (MacShane 58). This combination of infl uences, as with his imitation of other authors, played a large role in Chandler's development as a writer. In a letter to Alex Barris, he said that the result of his study and analysis of language was that \"when [he used] slang, solecisms, col-loquialisms, snide off beat language [he did] it deliberately\" (Chandler, Letters 155). Such an intentional use of language is a hallmark of Chandler's ction. Recognized then, and praised now , Chandler's ear for dialogue and language\u2014in particular his lyric similes inside a tough American voice\u2014raised his ction beyond the level of simple detective stories, a talent that Hollywood tried to harness during his career. In December 1933, Chandler submitted his rst story , \"Blackmailers Don't Shoot\" to Black Mask , one of the best and most popular pulp magazines that showcased hard-boiled ction, thereby enrolling himself in detective ction's hard-boiled school. Despite his success writing for Black Mask , however, Chandler did not want to remain a pulp writer. He aspired to write \"real\" ction in the form of the detec- tive story (MacShane 50-1). He wrote about this desire in several letters, once commenting, \"The thing is to squeeze the last drop out of the medium you have learned to use. The aim is not essentially different from the aim of Greek tragedy , but we are dealing with a public that is only semiliterate and we have to make an art of a language they can understand\"(Chandler, Letters 173). In other words, Chandler's goal was to use a popular form to impress \"some markedly subtler notions\" on an audience that was con-cerned primarily with escape (Speir 117). Chandler cared primarily about \"the creation of emotion through dialogue and description.\" In es- sence, he set out to prove to his readers that they did care about emotion, that emotion did not simply \"[hold] up the action.\" He once ventured: \"The thing they [the readers] remembered, that haunted them was not, for example, that a man got killed, but that in the moment of his death he was trying to pick a paper clip up off the polished surface of a desk and it kept slipping away from him, so that there was a look of strain on his face and his mouth was half open in a kind of tormented grin, and the last thing in the world he thought about was death. He didn't even hear the knock on the door. That damn little paper clip kept slipping away from his ngers\" (qtd. in Speir 119-20). This example skillfully summarizes what Chandler attempted to do with his ction. The \"tormented\" grin of a man trying to pick up a paper clip strikes an emotional note, even though the language aims for objective detail over emotion. The \"fragil-ity and absurdity of life\" is captured in these few brief sentences, as a man is killed while doing the most trivial of tasks (Speir 120). A close examination of Chandler's ction can certainly point to its pulp infl u- ences, but it also reveals, as demonstrated here, an expert stylist. Chandler's ability to take a popular form and transform it into something deeper prepared him for working as a novelist and creating his greatest character: Philip Marlowe. The Origins of a Hero: Marlowe before Marlowe Many believe Marlowe to be the quintessential private eye. In a letter written in 1951, Chandler wrote a long account detailing \"the facts of Philip Marlowe's life.\" This humorously written account ex-Explorations: An Undergraduate Research Journal 200310Christine Coit ists separately from the novels, creating an imaginary pre-history to Marlowe. Chandler used this lengthy sketch to give his reader an idea of the Marlowe whom he had in his own mind. Interestingly , despite the fact that Humphrey Bogart rst played Marlowe in the lm adaptation of The Big Sleep (1946), Chandler stated that \"the movie actor who could best represent [Marlowe] ... would have been Cary Grant.\" Chandler continued by providing a host of speci c details about Marlowe's life, including his physical ap- pearance (\"passably good looking\"), his drinking preferences (\"He will drink practically anything that is not sweet\"), and his manner of dress (\"I think he dresses as well as can be expected\") (Chandler, Letters 270-1). Despite the myriad of details Chandler provided, he gave \"only the barest outline of the hero who had been developing through the years in [his] works\" (Durham 79-80). Chandler did not \"know why [Marlowe] came to Southern California, except that eventually most people do\" (Chandler, Letters 270). Chandler's clarity about Marlowe's physical description, combined with his vagueness surrounding the character's personal history , explains in part why we can see that Marlowe actually arrived in the guise of another, and why it would take several successive reincarnations for the real Philip Marlowe to emerge. It is important to keep in mind that Chandler's short stories at rst served as the raw material for at least three novels: The Big Sleep (1939), Farewell, My Lovely (1940), and The Lady in the Lake (1943). Each owes most of its plot to one or more short stories. Chandler, as he termed it, \"cannibalized\" his short stories, transforming their simpler material into broader, more complicated plots (qtd. in MacShane 67). Additionally , in at least one situation, he combined the plots of several short stories to form the basis for a novel: The Big Sleep is a combination of \"Killer in the Rain\" (1935), \"The Curtain\" (1936), and \"The Man Who Liked Dogs\" (1936). According to Chandler, revamping material from his short stories gave the book \"body but it didn't make it any easier to write\" ( Letters 236). Although the detectives in the short stories prior to the publication of The Big Sleep were never named Philip Marlowe, Chandler said that Marlowe \"certainly had his genesis in two or three of the novelettes\" (qtd. in Speir 95). Indeed, according to Jerry Speir, \"some of the short-story detectives are so like Marlowe ... that their names were changed to Marlowe in reprinted editions without doing much damage to his character except making him ap-pear more violent\" (Speir 95). These changes, however, were not authorized by Chandler. Regardless, such particulars provide a basis from which to examine Chandler's early detectives as prototypes for the detective that would become Philip Marlowe. In the beginning, Chandler's detective was almost indistinguishable from the multitude of detec- tives that populated the pulps. Since Chandler began writing through imitation, it is not surprising that his rst detective, Mallory , was a fl at character, essentially identical to many other pulp detectives at the time (Durham 82). Mallory was a stock character, \"tall, with wide-set gray eyes, a thin nose, [and] a jaw of stone,\" with hair \"ever so faintly touched with gray , as by an almost dif dent hand\" (Chandler, \"Red Wind\" 69). 4 While Chandler's style may have set him apart from most authors of his medium\u2014his editor was uncertain whether \"Blackmailers Don't Shoot\" was \"remarkably good or cleverly fraudulent\"\u2014he had not yet developed his techniques of characterization (Durham 80). Thus, while his voice was unique, Mallory was not. However, as time went on, Chandler's protagonist came to be unique among the slew of pulp detectives. Chandler's detective went through a number of name changes in the short stories. In addition to Mallory , he was named Dalmas, Carmandy , and Evans, and even went nameless in a few stories. Yet, de-spite the change in name, the detective always operated according to the same set of principles. According to Philip Durham in his introduction to Killer in the Rain , Chandler's detective \"was motivated less by the desire to solve the mystery of a murder than by the compelling necessity to right social wrongs. There is murder in these stories, to be sure, but the detective risked his life and reputation to correct social injus-tices of any nature: to protect the weak, to establish ethical standards, to ease pain, or to salvage whatever might be left in fragile human beings. That the murderer was eventually caught and punished was not at Explorations: An Undergraduate Research Journal 200311Philip Marlowe: American Detective all as important as [this] main theme\" (xii). Although from the same mold, Chandler's protagonist tran- scended the typical hard-boiled detective who used violence as a means to all ends. Chandler's creation of a moral detective with a well-de ned ethical code was what made his detective \"something more than the typical tight-jawed, rootless, heavy-drinking heroes of Daly , Hammett, George Harmon Coxe or Lester Dent\" (Milner 117). It allowed Chandler to create a protagonist who was unlike any other. This ethical code, which included the righting of social wrongs, is most evident when the detective is a \"private eye who would rather help a sleazy blonde in distress than make a fast buck\" (from the cover of Killer in the Rain ). In \"Mandarin's Jade\" (1937), Dalmas is \"passionately ethical, one who would not think of accepting money until he [has] more than earned it\" (Durham, Introduction to Killer xi). In the story , he is hired for fty dollars as a bodyguard by Lindley Paul, a man who is murdered soon thereafter. As Dalmas is discussing the case with Carol Pride, a woman who appeared at the scene of the crime, the conversation turns to the fty dollars that the detective had been given. \"Fifty bucks ....I'll return it when I know who to return it to. Even my mother wouldn't think I earned it,\" Dalmas says (Chandler, Killer 186). Later in the story , he is sent for by a messenger with a hundred-dollar bill, which he returns before discussing the case. Dalmas also refuses $467 from a beautiful-albeit drunk-blonde who would \"make a bishop kick a hole in a stained-glass window\" (202). He never allows money to compromise his ethics. Chandler's detective works not for personal gain, but to see justice done. Dalmas begins to emerge as the detective whom Chandler would later describe in his famous essay \"The Simple Art of Murder\": \"He is the hero; he is everything....He will take no man's money dishonestly\" ( Simple Art 18). Despite the fact that Chandler's detective operates in a violent and shady world, he lives by his own moral code. Although sometimes forced to resort to questionable tactics, he recognizes his fault and chas-tises himself. For instance, in \"Try the Girl,\" Carmandy gets an alcoholic widow drunk in order to make her talk. Leaving, he berates himself for his actions: \"I like knowing myself,\" he thinks. \"I was the kind of guy who chiseled a sodden old wreck out of her life secrets to win a ten dollar bet\" (Chandler, Killer 141). He recognizes his dishonorable behavior and is not proud of his actions, even though they may have helped him progress in his case. At other times, the detective's actions are not strictly legal, but are honorably moral in his own eyes. For example, in a number of stories the detective does not cooperate with the police, refusing to disclose information, and, for all intents and purposes, obstructing justice. Yet, in violating the law , he is aiming to protect his client. Chandler's protagonist is often asked to choose between obeying the civic law and following his own ethical code. He strives to be a man of honor, for if he \"is a man of honor in one thing, he is that in all things\" (Chandler, \"The Simple Art\" 18). This com-plicated moral code would be the basis for Chandler's greatest protagonist. Philip Marlowe: The Birth of a Hero In The Big Sleep , Raymond Chandler introduces his readers to his detective and rst-person narrator, Philip Marlowe. The consistent narrator of all seven novels, Marlowe is \"on the surface a hard-boiled and cynical private eye but essentially a romantic, bound by a strict code of honor\" (Hall, How Fiction Works 137; hereafter cited as Fiction ). He follows the tradition of the hard-boiled detective, but is endowed with the moral code that Chandler gave his other detectives. Nevertheless, while Chandler's former detectives can be seen as prototypes for his greatest hero, Marlowe is a unique character. Chandler expanded Marlowe's characterization far past that of any of his previous detectives. Writing a novel, Chandler not only portrayed Marlowe on a larger canvas, but also developed him as a character under a completely different situation and set of rules. In contrast to writing for pulp magazines, which discouraged character development in favor of the sensational situations that grabbed readers' attention Explorations: An Undergraduate Research Journal 200312Christine Coit and kept them purchasing the magazine, writing a novel allowed Chandler much greater freedom. In a novel, \"the character must be produced on the page, whole and alive, his breath congealing on the air\" (Hall, The Art and Craft of Novel Writing 42; hereafter cited as Art). While the detectives of Chandler's short stories developed into characters who went beyond the conventions of other pulp detectives, it was in the pages of The Big Sleep and subsequent novels that Marlowe actually came to life. Marlowe's voice is an important aspect of his characterization, giving him life and breath on the writ- ten page. Some critics go so far as to say that \"Marlowe is ... not so much a fully developed character as he is an attitude, a tone of voice\" (Russell Davies, as paraphrased by Speir 109). To illustrate Chandler's development of Marlowe's voice, both MacShane and Hall point to a series of revisions of the nal para- graph of The Long Goodbye (1953). In this scene, Terry Lennox, the man who has hired Marlowe, is leav- ing the detective's of ce for the last time. The scene is emotionally charged since the friendship between the two is a major component of the novel. The dilemma that Chandler faces is how to add the necessary emotion to the scene, but still keep true to Marlowe as a character. Chandler's rst attempt has Marlowe saying: \"He turned away and went out. I watched the door close and listened to his steps going away . After a little while, I couldn't hear them, but I kept listening. Don't ask me why . I couldn't tell you.\" Unsatis ed, Chandler attempted a rewrite: \"He turned and went out. I watched the door close and listened to his steps going away . Then I couldn't hear them, but I kept on listening anyway . As if he might come back and talk me out of it, as I hoped he would. But he didn't.\" In both versions the emotional state is there, but is too sentimental, \"the last sentence [sounding] like a catch in the throat\" (MacShane 196). The version that appears in the novel reads: \"He turned and walked across the fl oor and out. I watched the door close. I listened to his steps going away down the imitation marble corridor. After a while they got faint, then they got silent. I kept on listening, anyway . What for? Did I want him to stop suddenly and turn and come back and talk me out of the way I felt? Well, he didn't. That was the last I saw of him. I never saw any of them again\u2014except the cops. No way has yet been invented to say goodbye to them\" (Chandler, The Long Goodbye 379). In the nal revision, Chandler has captured \"Marlowe's authentic tone of cynicism failing to conceal a depth of emotion\" (Hall, Art 138). Although there is de nite emotion, Marlowe's narrative voice tem- pers it. Marlowe's words contain no sentimentality , but rather emotion that is layered under a hard-boiled veneer. Focusing on aspects of setting, such as the closing door and imitation marble corridor, Marlowe allows these objects to take on some of the emotional burden. The catch-in-the-throat sentimentality of the earlier versions is replaced by the detective's questioning of his own motivation, almost as if he has caught himself in the act of becoming emotional and then tries to bury it. The answer implied by his question might read, \"It's not like I wanted him to come back.\" Yet, both Marlowe and the reader know that the detective does want Lennox to come back. This nal version keeps true to the voice that Chandler developed in his novels. In The Art & Craft of Novel Writing , Oakley Hall states that rst person narration gives an \"immediate advantage of a strong 'voice,' a vividness, an automatic authority ,\" but fails to give the author any distance from the material (33). The line between author and ctional narrator becomes blurred. Following this line of thought in \"The Writer as Detective Hero,\" Ross MacDonald argues that part of the pleasure of reading Chandler's novels is to witness the \"interplay between the mind of Chandler and the voice of Marlowe.\" He calls this Marlowe's \"doubleness,\" a \"bipolar prose,\" half-concealing Chandler's poetic and satiric mind.\" MacDonald uses Chandler's opening paragraph from The Big Sleep as an example of the \"Chandler-Marlowe prose\" at work (119): \"It was about eleven o'clock in the morning, mid October, with the sun not shining and a look of hard wet rain in the clearness of the foothills. I was wearing my powder-blue suit, with dark blue shirt, tie and display handkerchief, black brogues, black wool socks with dark blue clocks on them. I was neat, clean, shaved and sober, and Explorations: An Undergraduate Research Journal 200313Philip Marlowe: American Detective I didn't care who knew it. I was everything the well-dressed private detective ought to be. I was calling on four million dollars\" (Chandler, The Big Sleep 3). MacDonald's analysis of the paragraph reveals the interplay between Chandler and his hero, the lat- ter a mask for the former: \"Marlowe is making fun of himself, and of Chandler in the role of brash young detective. There is pathos, too, in the idea that a man who can write like a fallen angel should be a mere private eye; and Socratic irony . The gifted writer conceals himself behind Marlowe's cheerful mindless-ness. At the same time the retiring, middle-aged, scholarly author acquires a durable mask, forever 38, which allows him to face the dangers of society high and low\" (MacDonald 119). With Chandler's mind ever present in the narrative, Marlowe was molded and shaped into the hero that Chandler envisioned. Chandler's prescription for the detective-hero became Marlowe's: the intelligent mind of a university-educated man mixed with the hard-boiled exterior of his narrative voice. In \"The Simple Art of Murder,\" Chandler most clearly expressed his vision of this hero, who must be \"complete,\" \"common,\" and \"unusual.\" He must be a \"man of honor\" who is \"the best man in his world and a good enough man for any world.\" More speci cally , although he is \"relatively poor,\" he \"will take no man's money dishonestly .\" He is a \"common man\" who can be among common people, and yet remains \"a lonely man.\" And, in true fashion of all hard-boiled detectives, he \"talks as a man of his age talks\" and is a man \" t for adventure\" (\"Simple Art\" 18). Although Chandler toned down his \"Watsonian enthusiasm for his detective's moral superiority\" with each consecutive novel, Marlowe, more or less consistently , ts this description (MacDonald 118). Raymond Chandler's Knight The most popular and widely accepted reading of Philip Marlowe characterizes him as a knight- errant, described by the Oxford English Dictionary as \"a knight of medieval romance who [wanders] in search of adventures and opportunities for deeds of bravery and chivalry .\" In light of Marlowe's heroic qualities and his strict moral code, it is no wonder that readers of Chandler have often come to this inter-pretation. In \"The Case for Raymond Chandler's Fiction as Romance,\" Jonathan Holden identi es three elements that connect Marlowe with the chivalric romance: Marlowe's ctional world, his moral tests, and the physical danger and punishment he endures. C. S. Lewis best described the world of the chivalric romance in his essay \"The Anthropological Approach\": The romancers create a world where everything may , and most things do, have deeper meaning and a longer history than the errant knight would have expected; a world of endless forest, quest, hint, prophecy . Almost every male stranger wears armour; not only that there may be jousts but because visors hide faces. Any lady may prove a fay or devil; every castle conceals a holy or unholy mystery . The hero is a sort of intruder or trespasser; always, unawares, stumbling on to forbidden ground. Hermits and voices explain just enough to let us know how completely he is out of his depth, but not enough to dissipate the over-all mystery (309-310). Comparing Lewis' description with Marlowe's ctional world reveals a great many similarities, the only difference being that Chandler's version is modernized. Lewis' \"endless forest\" becomes \"the blas\u00e9 decadence of Hollywood and California\" (Speir 136). Guns rather than armor protect the \"male [strang-ers]\" in Marlowe's world, but for reasons that are just as sinister. The women come in two types: \"fays\" like Ann Riordan in Farewell, My Lovely ; and devils like Dolores Gonzales of The Little Sister (1949), Explorations: An Undergraduate Research Journal 200314Christine Coit \"slim, dark and lovely and smiling. Reeking with sex. Utterly beyond the moral laws of this or any world [one] could imagine\" (Chandler, Little 248). From nightclubs, bars, and gambling boats to mansions, hotels, and of ces, the knight-detective is confronted with an \"unholy mystery .\" Marlowe is always tread- ing on \"forbidden ground.\" The clues that he uncovers throughout each novel shed enough light to give us a hint of \"how completely he is out of his depth,\" but, on their own, they are \"not enough to dissipate the overall mystery\" (Speir 136). A second connection to the world of romance is that good and evil are easily recognized. A char- acter's moral standing is not ambiguous: he is either good or bad. In this world, the heroes are heroes, and the villains are villains; their positions are never in doubt. The hero \"is extraordinarily good. It is his superhuman task to clear up any apparent moral confusions and, by slaying a dragon, to vanquish evil and purify the realm.\" Like the romance hero, Marlowe is superhuman: \"[H]e can take more than mortal punishment and come up ghting and wisecracking ...[,] is ultimately immune to all temptations, and behaves honorably when most of us wouldn't\" (Holden 45). He ghts evil by bringing criminals to jus- tice. He aids the helpless, often working for little or no money . He takes a case and sticks to it, without self-serving motives. For their part, his adversaries, the villains, provide a multitude of obstacles to the completion of his task. Every knight is given moral tests to pass, and Marlowe is no exception. The most commonly featured moral test a knight faces is sexual temptation. In Sir Gawain and the Green Knight (ca. 1375-1400), for example, Sir Gawain is a young knight who must prove his valor, piety , and courtesy when confronted with a succession of temptations by Morgan le Fay (Holden 44). Marlowe. too, is regularly confronted with such temptations: Carmen Sternwood lying upon his bed, \"as naked and glistening as a pearl\" ( The Big Sleep 155); Mavis Weld appearing in \"a hostess gown and very else\" ( The Little Sister 72); and nymphomaniac Dolores Gonzales kissing Marlowe with a \"mouth ... as hot as ever a mouth was\" ( The Little Sister 72), to name but a few. Yet, with these women and others, Marlowe remains chaste. Due to the ubiquity of this kind of moral test in the novels, Marlowe's (and by extension, Chandler's) attitudes toward women have often come under critical scrutiny . As Jerry Speir points out, Marlowe's actions and attitudes towards women are commonly interpreted as \"conventional women hating,\" hardly the \"women-on-a-pedestal syndrome which is historically associated with Marlowe's kind of knight-er-rantry\" (Speir 111, 113). While I will admit that Marlowe's relationships with women are strained, I be-lieve that something beyond \"women hating\" is at the root of the problem. To examine this point, I take an oft-cited example from The Big Sleep . In The Big Sleep , Marlowe returns home to nd Carmen Sternwood lying naked on his bed. After he forces her to leave, he says: \"I went back to the bed and looked down at it. The imprint of her head was still in the pillow , of her small corrupt little body . I put my empty glass down and tore the bed to pieces savagely\" (158-9). Complicating matters are Marlowe's thoughts the next morning: \"You can have a hangover from other things than alcohol. I had one from women. Women made me sick\" (159). As Speir suggests, these remarks, taken in isolation, \"do suggest a man with a revulsion for the opposite sex,\" an attitude toward women that hardly ts with that of the knight-errant (112). Yet, what is not taken into consideration here are the circumstances surrounding the scene. As Speir points out, \"this is not the rst time Marlowe has found Carmen nude and up to her own games of sexual coercion\"; indeed, she has \"been throwing herself at him\" from the beginning of the novel (112). Yes, there is tension between Marlowe and the opposite sex, but it stems from outside factors rather than from Marlowe's attitude or character. Marlowe's \"problem\" with women can also be seen as a result of the knight's rule of comitatus , \"the duty to protect his liege lord's interests at all times\" and \"the rst rule Marlowe's knightly The Big Sleep 212-3). Charles Rzepka closely Explorations: An Undergraduate Research Journal espe- cially evident in Marlowe's loyalty to General Sternwood in The Big Sleep . Finding the General's younger daughter Carmen in his bed, Marlowe tells her: \"It's a question of professional pride. You know\u2014pro- fessional pride. I'm working for your father. He's a sick man, very frail, very helpless. He sort of trusts me not to pull any stunts. Won't you please get dressed, Carmen?\" (156). Remaining chaste presents Marlowe with a test of his ability to subsume his own human desires beneath the loyalty to his employer that his personal ethics demand. It creates strain in his relationships with women, because, as he admits, he's not \"an icicle....[He has] warm blood just like the next guy\" (151). If nothing, including love, can prevent the knight from completing his quest, then Marlowe should be able to withstand both physical danger and punishment. He should be like Gawain, who \"travels in the dead of winter in freezing armor to meet his foe, and when he does he is forced to hold still for an ax-blow which, he believes, will chop his head off\" (Holden 44-5). If one examines the novels, this is exactly the case. Marlowe suffers through and survives an inordinate amount of physical violence and punishment. He is repeatedly sapped, drugged, beat up, set up, shot at, and imprisoned; he is threatened with an arsenal of weapons, including guns, knives, ice picks, and sts. He is well accustomed to physical violence toward his person, and through it all he never wavers from his purpose. He is only temporarily delayed from continuing his quest. For instance, in Farewell, My Lovely , after being \"shot full of dope,\" he talks himself into going on: \"'Okay , Marlowe,' I said between my teeth. 'You're a tough guy . Six feet of iron man. One hundred and ninety pounds stripped and with your face washed. Hard muscles and no glass jaw. You can take it. You've been sapped down twice, had your throat choked and been beaten half silly on the jaw with a gun barrel. You've been shot full of hop and kept under it until you're as crazy as two waltzing mice. And what does all that amount to? Routine. Now let's see you do something really tough, like putting your pants on'\" (170-1). In short, Marlowe keeps all three decrees made in Sir Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur , in which the king dictates his knights' conduct. They are \"Never to do outragiousity nor murder, and always to fl ee treason; also, by no means to be cruel, but to give mercy unto him that asketh mercy..., and always to do ladies, damosels, and gentlewomen succour, upon pain of death\" (qtd. in Speir 115). While Marlowe's success in following this code is less obvious in his relationships with women, and despite the fact that his attitudes toward these \"damsels\" may seem strained, he always works in their interest. His task is always \"the knight's battle against evil as well as [a] quest for truth\" (Grella 115). Nevertheless, his quest is often ironic since the hidden truth he discovers is a source of further evil. Early on, Marlowe realizes that detection \"[isn't] a game for knights\" (Chandler, The Big Sleep 156). The Knight Turns Frontier Hero According to George Grella, the chivalric romance is not the only tradition from which Chandler's Marlowe emerged. Ostensibly , the writers of the hard-boiled genre created a new type of hero, the private eye. However, this \"new\" hero was \"actually another avatar of that prototypical American hero, Natty called Leatherstocking, Hawkeye, Deerslayer, and Path nder\" (Grella 106). Through the phenomenon of the dime novel, later replaced by pulp ction, characters in the image of Cooper's Leatherstocking proliferated. As the wilderness that once was America dwindled and was overtaken by an increasingly urban environment, the frontier hero evolved in both role and character into the hard-boiled detective, the new urban hero. Both the detective and Leatherstocking archetype have pro-nounced physical ability and a keen sense of morality; are isolated from relationships; and work outside the established social code, \"preferring [their] own instinctive justice to the often tarnished justice of civilization\" (Grella 106). Explorations: An Undergraduate Research Journal 200316Christine Coit Perhaps the most characteristic trait of the Leatherstocking archetype is his striking physical ability . Hawkeye, in The Last of the Mohicans (1826), must undergo unexpected violence, a treacherous country- side, and capture by Indians, only to rescue captives and kill Magua, the villain of the novel. Likewise, Marlowe must rely upon his strength and physical ability . He may shoot and brawl occasionally , but more often than not he is subjected to and survives more physical punishment than seems humanly possible. And, in true Hawkeye fashion, he displays \"stoic resistance\" to this suffering (Grella 107). The wisecracks he makes while being beaten are his way of refusing to show pain. In The Long Goodbye , for example, while Marlowe is suffering a beating by Captain Gregarious, a blow \"nearly [takes blood mixed with [He hears] nothing but a roaring in [his] head\" (47). Yet, Marlowe refuses to break, saying, \"No man likes to betray a friend but I wouldn't betray an enemy into your hands....[Y]ou had to abuse me, throw coffee in my face, and use your sts on me when I was in a spot where all I could do was take it. From now on I wouldn't tell you the time by the clock on your own wall\" (48). Often, for Marlowe, such physical abuse comes as a result of scrupulously following his own moral code. Like the frontier hero, Marlowe has an innate sense of morality . Just as Leatherstocking's \"notori-ous virtue\" seems to be almost \"a hereditary trait\" (Smith 96), Marlowe refuses certain kinds of detective work, and will hire out for \"only the fairly honest kinds\" (Chandler, Lady in the Lake 9). He works for little or no money , and has dif culty accepting or spending it when he believes he did not earn it honestly . In The Long Goodbye , for instance, he says of a ve-thousand dollar bill, \"I'll never spend a nickel of it. Because there was something wrong with the way I got it\" (281). Beyond his sense of duty , Marlowe is motivated by compassion, is \"drawn to the outcast, the vulnerable, [and] the miserable, often working only for what [he conceives] as justice\" (Grella 108). He tells Bernie Ohls in The Long Goodbye, \"I'm a romantic, Bernie. I hear voices crying in the night and I go see what's the matter. You don't make a dime that way . You got sense, you shut your windows and turn up more sound on the TV set....Stay out of other people's troubles. All it can get you is the smear....You don't make a dime that way\" (280-1). Marlowe's moral code oftentimes \"exacts severe personal sacri ce\" as well in the area of love and friendship (Grella 109). Throughout the novels, Marlowe is denied masculine companionship. In The Long Goodbye, for instance, Terry Lennox comes close, but at the end leaves Marlowe listening to his footsteps fade down the hallway . Companionship or romance with the \"desirable woman\" is likewise denied him by virtue of her character: she is usually \"corrupt, a bitch or a murderess, too evil to deserve [his] compassion\" (Grella 109). In The Little Sister , for example, Marlowe must reject three women: Mavis Weld, the excessively sexual Dolores Gonzales, and Orfamay Quest, in appearance the innocent virgin but in reality the blackmailing accessory to a murder. Because of his moral code, and the inappro-priateness of these women as mates, he is denied the opportunity for passion and must remain celibate. In addressing his \"love\" for Mavis Weld, he also highlights the difference in moral code that makes her an unsuitable mate when he says that a relationship with Mavis \"would be kind of silly . I could sit in the dark with her and hold hands, but for how long? In a little while she will drift off into a haze of glamour and expensive clothes and froth and unreality and muted sex. She won't be a real person any more. Just a voice from a sound track, a face on a screen. I'd want more than that\" (248). This is yet another link to his frontier hero predecessors. In The Deerslayer , for example, the chaste Leatherstocking must remain celibate because his possible love interest is \"stained by past coquetries,\" while her \"offstage marriage [to] a British of cer\" highlights the different moral code by which the frontier hero operates (Smith 67). The nal trait that Marlowe and the frontier hero share is isolation. Leatherstocking is the \"lonely man of the forests,\" representing the \"antithesis between nature and civilization, between freedom and law\" (Grella 106; Smith 60). Marlowe, as a private detective, is also separate from the law. He is not an extension of the police; in fact, he often refuses to disclose information to them in order to protect his Explorations: An Undergraduate Research Journal 200317 client. He prefers to work separately from the police because he nds their brutality , corruption, and incompetence at odds with his conception of justice. In most instances, he is the object of their erce tactics. Consider, for example, a scene from The Lady in the Lake in which two corrupt Bay City cops force Marlowe to drink whisky , threatening that if he does not, \"We might get the idea you wanted feetprints on your stomach\"; they then punch him anyway and arrest him on the charge of drunk driving (172-3). In The Long Goodbye , Marlowe verbalizes his contempt for cops of this type when he tells Captain Gregarious, \"'You're not only a gorilla, you're an incompetent'\" (48). At odds with the police, denied masculine friendship, and devoid of an appropriate female companion, Marlowe is a lonely man in a lonely town. Leatherstocking's habitat is the frontier, that unexplored periphery that is still wild, unknown, un- conquered, and uninhabited. It is therefore tting that Chandler sets all of his novels in California, \"where the frontier has nally disappeared\" (Grella 110). Marlowe is a Leatherstocking who, in essence, has run out of territory . He has completed the westward movement; the frontier is no more. He has ar-rived in California only to nd that the pull westward to conquer a vacant continent has not brought him to the idyllic territory he had hoped to nd. As Grella writes, \"He does not nd the Edenic land of his dreams, the Great Good Place of the American imagination, but the Great Bad Place. He nds ... a green and golden land raped of its fecundity and beauty . Where he had expected innocence and love, he nds the pervasive blight of sin, a society fallen from grace, an endless struggle against evil. Instead of a fertile valley , he discovers a cultural cesspool....He nds the American Dream metamorphosed into the American Nightmare\" (112-3). The images of a nightmare and cultural cesspool provide a stark opposi-tional background for the detective and his moral code, thus accentuating his distinctness. As the \"best man in his world,\" he is set apart (Chandler, \"Simple Art\" 18). The world is almost unworthy of a man of his caliber. He does not t into the \"urban jungle\" in which he is left to roam (Grella 112). Marlowe and Raymond Chandler's Los Angeles California may be unworthy of Marlowe's inherent goodness, but the impression that its moral geography makes on him is an important contributor to his character. In essence, the modern knight/frontier hero needs the contrast of the \"luxury trades, the pansy decorators, the Lesbian dress design-ers, the riffraff of a big hard-boiled city with no more personality than a paper cup\" to show what he is not (Chandler, The Little Sister 183-4). Such a backdrop of characters makes him look even more moral than he would be in an entirely different setting. In Raymond Chandler's Los Angeles, a city where \"pale stars ... know enough to keep their distance,\" he appears almost angelic (67). Chandler, Chicago-born and England-raised, rst migrated to Southern California in 1913, and, after World War I, returned there to settle. It was a period in which Los Angeles was undergoing tremen-dous change. Between 1880 and 1930, Los Angeles was the best-advertised city in America, promoted \"as the New World Garden, the new El Dorado, the place of the fresh start and unlimited opportunity\" (Fine 198). People were drawn to the state for various reasons: to bask in the warmer climate, to recover from illness, to indulge in a number of new religions and philosophies, and to live the American Dream. By the end of the 1930s, Los Angeles had replaced San Francisco as California's most populated metropolitan area, with a population of approximately 1.5 million; the \"California Dream\" had \"migrated south\" (Fine 198). As a resident of Los Angeles County , a one time Vice President of South Basin Oil Company , and a Hollywood screen writer and Academy Award nominee, Raymond Chandler soaked \"in the ambience and details of metropolitan Los Angeles\" (Starr 305). He witnessed and experienced Los Angeles life on a number of different levels. He saw the city during Depression, war, and peace. While living there, Philip Marlowe: American DetectiveExplorations: An Undergraduate Research Journal 200318 Chandler survived on as little as $2000 a year, only later to earn so much that he paid $50,000 in income tax (Starr 305). Although he and his wife Cissy moved constantly , 1940s Los Angeles remained a central focus in his novels. Ultimately , Chandler's experiences in Los Angeles, along with his attention to detail, his brilliant dialogue, and his creative mind earned him the title of Los Angeles' Poet Laureate. Chandler portrays Los Angeles as a bright city with a dark underworld. Only Chandler could \"re- duce the sunny California setting to a gray atmosphere of despair: bourbon for breakfast, bloody corpses, and shadowy streets lit by neon lights\" (Phillips xxiii). Interestingly , most of Chandler's rst novel, The Big Sleep , portrays California not as the sunny land of endless beach, but as a dreary , dark, cloudy , rain- drenched land. The traditional portrayal of California is absent, while an almost Seattle-like milieu takes over. The setting mirrors the dark underbelly of Los Angeles life. The novel begins by describing the Golden State in a way far different from the boosters' advertise- ments. Not only is \"the sun not shining,\" but there is \"a look of hard wet rain in the clearness of the foothills\" (3). Immediately in the opening scene, and throughout the rest of the novel, Chandler subverts the rose-tinted view of the city that was being advertised to the outside world. Chandler portrays Los Angeles and nearby Hollywood as places where respectable fa\u00e7ades often mask more sinister dealings. In Chandler's hands, California became a place where illusion and reality collided, where it was not clear where one ended and the other began. Because of this duality , the city becomes Marlowe's \"constant adversary ,\" breeding an evil that he searches out and uncovers (Phillips xxiii). In The Big Sleep , for instance, it is up to Marlowe to nd out that a business called Rare Books and De Luxe Editions is a cover for a pornography ring. In Chandler's Los Angeles, things are never what they appear to be. While Chandler details \"the crimes made possible in a place that was up for grabs and where fortunes were made in the exploitation of water, land, and oil,\" it is Marlowe's duty to eradicate such evil from the City of Angels, one case at a time (Fine 198). Despite Marlowe's successes and his persistent attempts, however, after seven novels crime remains as rampant as ever. The city is rife with \"gangsters, psychos, and con artists\" who people the seedy underworld (Phillips xxiii). Their evil permeates every facet of California life. Given this, it is little wonder that Chandler chose this setting as his hero's haunt. Marlowe himself fl uctuates between love and hate in his relationship with the city . At one time, some- thing brought this Santa Rosa native to the mean streets of Los Angeles. As Starr puts it, Marlowe, \"like so many of his clients, is a victim of the siren call of L.A.\" (307). In The Little Sister , Marlowe describes the Los Angeles that used to be: \"There were trees along Wilshire Boulevard. Beverly Hills was a country town. Westwood was bare hills and lots offering at eleven hundred dollars and no takers. Hollywood was a bunch of frame houses on the interurban line. Los Angeles was just a big dry sunny place with ugly homes and no style, but goodhearted and peaceful. It had the climate they just yap about now. People used to sleep out on porches.\" He admits that he \"used to like this town ... a long time ago\" and laments its transformation from the so-called \"Athens of America\" to \"a neon-lighted slum.\" The transformation of the city and the feelings it engenders in Marlowe are made clear when he spies a club with a packed terrace and parking lot. It is so overcrowded, that the people are \"like ants on a piece of overripe fruit\" (183). The image immediately tells the reader what has changed Los Angeles: the population boom of the early twentieth century . Marlowe, too, is reminded of what Los Angeles has become, and begins to name its faults. Earlier in the novel, Marlowe has driven from Sunset Boulevard, through Malibu, and back to Los Angeles. As he does so, he berates every place on his route. Hollywood screen stars are written off with a decided \"phooey .\" They are simply \"the veterans of a thousand beds.\" Malibu holds more of the same: \"More movie stars. More pink and blue bathtubs. More tufted beds. More Chanel No. 5. More Lincoln Continentals and Cadillacs. More wind-blown hair and sunglasses and attitudes and pseudo-re ned voic-Christine CoitExplorations: An Undergraduate Research Journal 200319 es and waterfront morals.\" Just when the reader believes that Marlowe couldn't be any harsher, he an- nounces that he \"smelled Los Angeles before [he] got to it,\" and \"it smelled stale and old like a living room that had been closed too long\" (80-81). The sentiments certainly depict a man fed up with the crowded streets, the loose morals, the lm star snobbery , and all the other aspects of metropolitan life. And the novel makes it ever clearer why our moral knight and frontier hero just does not t in among the refuse that populates the city . It leaves one asking the question, Why doesn't he leave? There are plenty of towns that mirror the Los Angeles that Marlowe came to and that would be vastly different from the one that he inhabits now . In The Dream Endures: California Enters the 1940s , Kevin Starr ventures to explain Marlowe's pre- dicament. He argues that Los Angeles made the careers of both Chandler and Marlowe, and without it they would have been \"disembodied ghosts\" (306). The city had sparked Chandler's imagination, allow-ing him to artfully write seven novels and a host of short stories. Starr concludes, \"Without the crime, the gangsters, the corrupt cops, the shakedowns, the payoffs, the seedy hotels of Los Angeles, what would Chandler have to write about? Or how would Philip Marlowe make his living? Like Chandler, Marlowe knows the nasty underside of the town, knows how it could eat up little people by giving them impossible hopes. Yet where is Marlowe to go? The pain and misbehavior of Los Angeles are not only his craft and profession, they are his obsession as well. It is too late to leave, too late to learn another place\" (306-7). Although Los Angeles is no longer the city of Marlowe's dreams, it is his obsession. He is the knight who patrols the mean streets, doing good and vanquishing evil. He is the frontier hero who has arrived in California to nd that there is no more unexplored territory , but nevertheless has made it his home. He treats the urban jungle as his new frontier and becomes a champion for the innocent. The decadence of Los Angeles provides Marlowe with a duty that ts his dual role as knight and frontier hero. For better or worse, this world of crooked cops, brutal murderers, grifters, racketeers, and sleazy blondes provides Marlowe with his occupation and his identity . Conclusion: Marlowe as an American Hero The common thread that ties together these varied aspects of Marlowe's character is his American- ness. De ning something as American , however, is a dif cult endeavor. The question, \"What is an American?\", is one that has been asked at least since 1782, when Hector St. John de Crevecoeur de-voted a chapter to it in his Letters from an American Farmer . As people throughout our nation's history have attempted to answer this question, they have relied upon the \"varying national self-consciousness\" that has changed with the times (Smith 3). Freedom and republicanism may de ne our country at one time, while melting pot, capitalism, Manifest Destiny , and world superpower de ne it at others. In the case of Raymond Chandler, an additional complication arises when one considers how a self-professed Anglophile, who learned American English as a separate dialect, can be said to create a truly American character. Nevertheless, based upon the genres that produced him, the archetypes upon which he is modeled, and the setting he inhabits, certainly Chandler's Marlowe is as American as any character in American literature. In terms of detective ction as a genre, the likes of Philip Marlowe, Sam Spade, and the Op had never been seen in British detection, which was too genteel and too invested in the detective's superior reasoning abilities to produce a character so hard-boiled. Although Chandler may have been reared in England, the dialogue he wrote is anything but British. Chandler's character spoke an American slang in a poetically sharp-edged manner. You would never Hurcule Poirot grumble, \"Oh hell and refl ies,\" and then see him \"gobble a quick drink\" (Chandler, The High Window 261). Nor would you Philip Marlowe: American DetectiveExplorations: An Undergraduate Research Journal 200320 hear Sherlock Holmes explain, \"Then we have Dr. Lester Vukanich. Ear, Nose, and Throat, Stockwell Building on Hollywood Boulevard. This one's a dilly . Of ce practice mostly , and seems to sort of special- ize in chronic sinus infections. Rather a neat routine. You go in and complain of a sinus headache and he washes out your antrums for you. First of course he has to anesthetize with Novocain. But if he likes your looks it don't have to be Novocain. Catch?\" ( The Long Goodbye 115). In words and actions, Marlowe exudes the physical toughness that has come to be identi ed as an American trait. While King Arthur and his knights stemmed from British antiquity , Philip Marlowe is a thoroughly modern American knight. Although the origins of this archetype may not be American, Chandler's updat-ing of it most certainly is. In Philip Marlowe's adventures, the world of literary romance is given a mod-ernized, American twist. Marlowe adheres to the duties of a knight-errant, but never loses his American fl avor. A \"shop-soiled Galahad,\" he is worn and faded from the trials that an American experience has dealt him, but always perseveres (Chandler, The High Window 209). James Fenimore Cooper was the rst author to portray American scenes and characters in a serious manner, and Marlowe is in many respects a Cooperesque character. He has Leatherstocking's physi-cal competence, moral code, and isolation from entangling domestic relationships. He is also placed in Leatherstocking's frontier-only one hundred years later, it is no longer the frontier, or even the edge of the frontier, but a settled urban space-yet violent, dangerous, and nearly anarchic nonetheless. Like his creator, Marlowe came to Los Angeles when it stood as a symbol for the culmination of the American Dream. The city not only supplied Marlowe with his profession but also became his obsession. Its dark underworld provided a distinct contrast not only to the glamour of its popular image, but also to the moral light that guided the detective-hero. As Marlowe's haunt, it allows Chandler to illustrate the good and bad of American society: the moral and the indecent, the honest and the crooked, the lawful and the lawless. What better location to choose to illustrate these dualities of American culture than Los Angeles and Hollywood, cities where illusion and reality come head to head? Yet, while Marlowe appears to be the prototypical American character, there remains something elusive about him. He is American, but not unequivocally so. While some have attributed this-rightly in my estimation-to Chandler's distinctively British prose, I would like to take it a bit further and ascribe it to Chandler's ambivalence about his own national identity . As an American citizen raised in England, Chandler was a man without a clear national identity . In a letter to Carl Brandt, he once wrote: I had grown up in England and all my relatives were either English or Colonial. And yet I was not English. I had no feeling of identity with the United States, and yet I resented the kind of ignorant and snobbish criticism of Americans that was current at the time. During my year in Paris I had run across a good many Americans, and most of them seemed to have a lot of bounce and liveliness and to be thoroughly en-joying themselves in situations where the average Englishman of the same class would be stuffy or completely bored. But I wasn't one of them. I didn't even speak their language. I was, in effect, a man without a country ( Letters 250). If, as Ross MacDonald and others have noted, there is \"an interplay between the mind of Chandler and the voice of Marlowe\" (119), it stands to reason that Chandler's ambivalence over-or alienation from-a national identity would be transferred to Marlowe. The detective's tough exterior and hard-boiled dia-logue almost allow him to t into an American setting, but in the end he still walks down those \"mean streets\" alone. Refused companionship, a love interest, or even the camaraderie of a co-worker, Marlowe is detached from the society in which he inhabits. He may \"speak their language,\" but he is not \"one of them\" ( Letters 250). Christine CoitExplorations: An Undergraduate Research Journal 200321 Yet his literary identity remains distinctive. And so we take leave of our hero. Darkness is falling upon the city of Los Angeles. Clouds are covering the sky , depriving the night of moon and stars. The pale light from street lamps and neon signs picks up the glimmer of rain-drenched asphalt. The air is still. The sound of pounding footsteps echoes through a back alley where a dead man lies. Gunshots ring out in a fl ea-bag hotel. The sound of a woman's scream penetrates the darkness. Somewhere, two crooked cops are tailing their next victim. In the heart of the city , a sheer curtain rustles in the window of an of- ce. A phone rings. Once. T wice. A sturdy hand lifts the receiver and cradles it in his hand: \"Yeah, this is Marlowe.\" Notes 1. Listed here are the dates of the stories' original publications in various serials.

Bronson Abstract Lysyl oxidase-like protein is a member of the LOX copper-de-pendent amine oxidase family and plays a role in the development and maintenance of the extracellular matrix. Immunohistological staining (rabbit polyclonal antibody 1:500) of was in the dentate gyrus of LOXL+/+ but not LOXL-/- mice, and not in the CA1 pyramidal cell layer of either. Den-tate granule cells from LOXL-/- mice were smaller than those in LOXL +/+ mice. We tested the hypothesis that lack of LOXL and altered mor-phology may result in changes in neuronal plasticity in the dentate gy-rus. Electrical recordings were obtained in 300 m hippocampal slices in the dentate (following perforant path stimulation) and in the CA1 pyramidal cell layer (following stimulation of the stratum radiatum). Potentiation (measured 30 minutes after tetanus) was expressed as a percentage of the pre-tetanus population spike amplitude. Potentiation in the CA1 cell layer 12 12 LOXL+/+ mice was 188.4 9.3% and 184.4 13.7%, respectively (mean of 119.2 7.0% and 119.3 3.9% in 12 LOXL-/- and 12 LOXL+/+ mice, respectively . As measured by PSA there was no signi - cant difference in potentiation between LOXL+/+ and LOXL-/- mice in either the dentate granule or CA1 pyramidal cell layers. Because there are marked dentate structural changes in LOXL-/- mice, we conclude that in LOXL-/- mice other structural proteins may compensate so that pre- and post-synaptic elements remain functionally positioned to en-sure viable synaptic plasticity .Explorations: An Undergraduate Research Journal 200324Nathan W. Bronson Introduction For over a century the medial temporal region of the brain, and more speci cally the hippocampus, has been the suspected site of long-term memory disorders such as amnesia. However, until 1986 there had not been any published clinical reports in which the human subjects had damage to the hip- pocampus alone. Because of this absence, understanding of the nature of the link between memory and the hippocampus was based on speculation. On September 18, 1978 a patient named R. B. suffered an ischemic episode that resulted from an ar- terial tear following coronary bypass surgery . During this episode R. B. developed a bilateral lesion in the CA1 region of his hippocampus but no other signi cant damage elsewhere in the brain. Zola-Morgan 1 reported that this lesion resulted in an anterograde amnesia in which R. B. could remember everything he learned prior to the surgery but could not recall events that occurred afterward. This nding strongly supported the speculation that the hippocampus plays an important role in memory and learning. The hippocampus may facilitate the storage of information by enabling increases in synaptic ef - ciency for very speci c neural circuits. Bliss 2,3 con rmed this possibility when in the early 1970s he re- ported that high frequency stimulation of speci c neural pathways in the hippocampus led to an increase in synaptic strength. This increase is now termed \"Long-Term Potentiation\" or LTP . While LTP is not permanent, it does last a matter of hours in vitro and days in vivo 5 and may contribute to the conversion of short-term to long-term memory4. The cellular mechanism responsible for LTP induction involves the activation of two post-synaptic glutamate receptors, NMDAR and AMPAR, by a high frequency stimulus termed tetanus. During single shock stimulation, the pre-synaptic terminal releases moderate levels of glutamate. This neurotransmitter binds to AMPAR on the post-synaptic membrane to open a channel so that ions may fl ow down their con- centration gradient into the cell, moderately depolarizing the post-synaptic membrane. NMDA receptors lie dormant, their channels plugged by Mg ++ ions. During tetanus, high levels of glutamate are released and the post-synaptic membrane is strongly depolarized to knock the Mg 2+ plug off of the NMDAR and allow its channel to open. Ca 2+ may now enter the post-synaptic cell through the NMDA channel and in- duce a cascade of biochemical reactions that in turn induce the up-regulation of post-synaptic receptors, causing an increase in the excitability of the post-synaptic cell. At this point low frequency stimuli evoke a much larger response than previously in the hippocampal network, the hallmark of LTP (Fig. 1). The proteins collagen and elastin are cross- linked by the enzyme lysyl oxidase to form a rigid matrix that supports cellular structures and mem-brane components. Lysyl oxidases comprise a family of copper-dependent amine that link collagen and elastin bers of the extracellular matrix by oxidizing cells may be held in alignment by this extracel-lular matrix. The AMPAR and NMDAR, two post-synaptic glutamate receptors critical to the devel-opment of LTP , may also be held in place by the proteins collagen and elastin of the extracellular matrix. Recently , researchers at the University of Hawaii developed a knockout mouse that does Figure 1. The cellular components of L TP . Note that increased glutamate release (right) activates the NMDAR and allows calcium to fl ow into the post-synaptic cell, an event that does not occur during normal transmission but that sets off a biochemical cascade that serves to establish and maintain LTP . (Figure courtesy of Nicoll and Malenka. 5)Explorations: An Undergraduate Research Journal 200325The Role of Lysyl Oxidase-Like Protein in Mouse Hippocampal Long-Term Potentiation not oxidase-like protein (LOXL), and found that dentate granule cells in the hippocampus of this animal were smaller than those observed in the hippocampus of wild-type littermates. A mouse de cient in the LOXL enzyme may not be able to properly align critical synaptic components and thus may not be able to generate LTP . Hence, we hypothesized that lack of LOXL and the resulting altered morphology of dentate granule cells may result in altered neuronal plasticity in the dentate gyrus. Materials and Methods ANIMALS T wenty-four mice of approximately eight weeks of age were obtained from the University of Hawaii and housed according to standards approved by the UC Davis Animal Care and Use Committee. All mice were housed together in a 12:12 light:dark cycle and fed ad libitum . Experimental animals consisted of four groups: 6 male LOXL-/-, 6 female LOXL-/-, 6 male LOXL +/+, and 6 female +/+. All animals were of a C57BL6 genetic background and, to ensure objectivity , experimenters who performed slice experiments were kept unaware of the subject's genotype at the time of experiments. TISSUE PREPARATION AND INCUBATION Each animal was sacri ced between 0800 and 0840 PST by decapitation during the rst hour of its light cycle. The brain was immediately excised and placed in high sucrose/low sodium arti cial cere- fl minute approximately 3oC. The hippocampus was removed and then sectioned to 300\u00b5m thick slices using a vibratome. Hippocampal slices were immediately placed in HSLSaCSF at approximately 33.8 \u00b0C and perfused with 95/5% O2/CO2 gas for 30 minutes, then allowed to cool passively to room temperature over a period of 30 minutes. Slices were subsequently transferred via wide mouth pipette to standard aCSF perfused with 95/5% O 2/CO2 gas, where they remained until the time of experiment. LTP INDUCTION Electrodes were placed in the slice in two geometrical arrangements: 1) to record evoked responses in the dentate gyrus, tungsten stimulating elctrodes were placed in the per-forant pathway (pp) and a borosilicate glass recording elec-trode was placed in the dentate gyrus granule cell layer (DG); 2) to record evoked responses in the CA1 pyramidal cell lay-er, tungsten stimulating electrodes were placed among the Schaffer collaterals (SCA) in the CA3 region of the stratum radiatum and a borosilicate glass recording electrode was placed in the CA1 pyramidal cell layer (Fig. 2). The protocol to determine whether an evoked popula- tion response was enhanced by tetanus was as follows: 1) Evoked responses for increasing stimulus ampli- tude were recorded in order to construct an input/output curve so that we could establish the half-maximal stimulus. Then a series of four averages of ve evoked responses each was recorded over 20 Figure 2. The anatomy of the hippocampus.

Bronson minutes to establish a baseline response at a half-maximal stimulus. 2) The slice was tetanized\u2014shocked with a half-maximal voltage at 100Hz for one second ve times. 3) A series of seven averages of ve evoked responses each was recorded over thirty minutes to establish a post-tetanus response at half-maximal stimulus. 4) The mean of the last four responses was divided by the mean of the four baseline responses, and expressed as a percent to determine the degree of potentiation. 5) An evoked response was recorded at a stimulus intensity greater than half-maximal to ensure that the slice was not saturated. Results LTP was reliably established and maintained (Fig. 3), but there was no statistically signi cant dif- ference between mice of different genders or genotypes (Fig. 4). Potentiation in the CA1 cell layer of 12 LOXL-/- and 12 LOXL+/+ mice was 188.4 9.3% and 184.4 13.7%, respectively (mean SE). The showed potentiation of 119.2 7.0% and 119.3 respec- tively . LTP was consistently higher when measured in the CA1 region of both genotypes and genders, relative to the LTP measured in the dentate gyrus region of the hippocampus (Fig. 5). As indicated by immunohistochemical staining, LOXL was found to be expressed by the dentate granule cells in the hippocampus of LOXL+/+ mice, but not of LOXL+/- or LOXL-/- mice. LOXL was not expressed in the CA1 region of any mice (Fig. 6). Figure 3. Population spike amplitude. The amplitude of the evoked response was determined by using the equation [(A-B)+(C-B)]/2.Figure 4. A representative recording of L TP in the hippocampus. A stable baseline was recorded over 20 minutes, a tetanus was applied, and recordings were taken at the same half-maximal stimulus intensity for 35 minutes after tetanus. The evoked response increases dramatically and remains increased after a tetanus is applied. This long-lasting increase is indicative of LTP .Explorations: An Undergraduate Research Journal 200327The Role of Lysyl Oxidase-Like Protein in Mouse Hippocampal Long-Term Potentiation Figure 5.

Bronson Discussion The current study suggests that plastic changes, and more speci cally LTP , in the dentate granular and CA1 pyramidal circuits of the hippocampus are not dependant on the presence of lysyl oxidase- like protein. While structural differences were observed between the dentate granule cells of LOXL-/- mice and those of LOXL+/+ mice, the ability to establish and maintain LTP was equal in both groups. Accordingly , while LOXL may be needed for the proper development of dentate granular cells, such development is not needed in either the establishment or maintenance of LTP . However, one alternative explanation for this nding may be that developmental mechanisms have compensated for structural de ciencies resulting from the lack of LOXL. For example, other proteins in the lysyl oxidase family which serve a similar function as LOXL may have been up-regulated in response to the LOXL de ciency imposed by our knockout. As a result, any effects of the knockout may be masked by compensatory mechanisms. Further studies of the expression of other lysyl oxidases in this model must be completed to rule out such a possibility .

There are several reasons why Colombia is an interesting case study . For most of the past three decades, Colombia has maintained a fairly high infl ation rate, averaging 24.9% between 1975 and 1992 (see Fig. 1). Economic reforms were implemented in 1991, and from that point on the country followed a process of disinfl ation that led to the current infl ation level of 6-7%. While most Latin American economies were able to stabilize their infl ation at low levels in a matter of months or a few years, Columbia took some thirteen years and is still struggling to maintain the lower rates amid changes in policy and in the economic conditions of the country . Implicit in the uniqueness of the Colombian example are two fundamentally interesting questions: rst, what factors were most infl uential in driving down infl ation; and second, why did it take so long? Figure 1. Rate of Colombian infl ation (in percentages, left), 1955-2001.Explorations: An Undergraduate Research Journal 200330Alfredo Burlando A convincing answer to these questions must take into account several factors. The conduct of scal policy has a very important role in determining prices: a spendthrift government is more likely to fuel infl ation, or to counteract disinfl ation, than a scally responsible one. Monetary policy also affects infl a- tion by means of complex transmission mechanisms. Furthermore, the structure of the economy must also be taken into consideration. Nominal rigidities such as varying degrees of wage indexation or of union power in wage setting can effectively impede a smooth transition to low infl ation even under the presence of strict scal policy and brilliant monetary management. Psychology as well must be included in the answer, given that consumer assumptions and expectations can drive rates of infl ation in either direction or can keep them static even in the face of shifting economic conditions. It is not the objective of this analysis to go over each and every one of the elusive parts contributing to the broader answer. Instead, this work focuses exclusively on the role of monetary policy , in the belief that it plays the leading role in affecting prices. This is particularly true in Colombia, where a primary mission of the Central Bank has been to ght infl ation. This essay assesses the Colombian Central Bank's actions in light of its mission of stabilizing prices. It will show that the Bank has maintained a policy that on average is conducive to lower prices, and that the disinfl ation of the nineties is in many respects the positive outcome of such policies. However, I will also suggest that, although this policy has been mildly successful, its effectiveness is ultimately hampered by the fact that it is a patchwork of different approaches and strategies with limited overall coherence. In particular, I contend that the conduct of monetary policy in the early 1990s was more hawkish against infl ation than it has been in the last few years. This claim might come as a surprise, given that it is often suggested that the Colombian Central Bank seriously undertook infl ation targeting only after 1999, when exchange rate constraints were eliminated. It might also seem to run counter to the facts, since the bulk of disinfl ation took place after 1999. Nevertheless, this idea may not be so far-fetched when we consider two facts: rst, that the exchange rate peg and crawling band often worked as an implicit infl ation target for most of the nineties, and, second, that the expansionary policies of the last ve years can be defended on the grounds of hastening a recovery from the terrible 1999 recession, which may well be the true cause of the sudden disinfl ation. Theoretical Underpinnings INFLATION Until a few decades ago, infl ation was deemed to be a necessary evil. Keynesian theories of price stickiness and empirical analysis of the relation between infl ation and unemployment showed that nomi- nal changes\u2014for example, growth in money supply\u2014had a real effect on the economy . It was widely believed that there was a tradeoff, also known as the Phillips curve, between the level of infl ation and economic growth. Eager to exploit such a tradeoff, many governments around the world pursued expan-sionary monetary policies designed to increase infl ation rates and promote high economic growth. These policies were widely favored in Central and South America as well; already in the sixties many countries, including Colombia, were experiencing the dual acceleration of prices and growth. The positive relationship between infl ation and economic growth, however, proved to be short- lived; the seventies and the eighties left most countries with high infl ation rates and sluggish growth. The so-called monetarists, led by Lucas, were able to prove that rationality of the agents in the economy could explain the breakdown of the Phillips curve. Lucas's critique led to the important theoretical con-clusion that an increase in the money supply caused by expansionary monetary policies has a dual effect on the economy . First, it causes a permanent increase in prices; second, it causes a temporary economic expansion, soon replaced by a return to the steady state of the economy . It directly follows from this Explorations: An Undergraduate Research Journal 200331The Colombian Monetary Policy Experience: Attempts at Disinfl ation, 1990-2002 conclusion that monetary policy in the long run has no effect on output but leaves its permanent mark on the infl ation rate. Once the party caused by infl ation's short-term bene ts to the economy was over, policymakers were left with the broken dishes. Infl ation has many liabilities, as explained by Bernanke, Laubach, Mishkin and Posen (1999). In their book Infl ation T argeting , they offer several reasons why even moderate levels of infl ation can be harmful for an economy , and why countries experiencing high infl ation usually ex- perience poor economic performance. In periods of high infl ation, the purchasing power of money falls steadily , forcing people to hold less cash. Often this means a smaller money demand and an overexten-sion of the nancial system as people use checks and other nancial transactions more often than simple cash transactions. 1 High infl ation is also a central cause of uncertainty in an economy , and thus a source of market inef ciency . For example, it may be responsible for the poor functioning of product and labor markets, as prices lose their meaning and people nd it dif cult to assess what constitutes a \"fair price\" for merchandise or for services. More compelling to the case of Colombia, infl ation has grave distribu- tional effects; higher infl ation can erode savings of the middle classes if the savings are kept in low-yield- ing current accounts. Whereas wealthier and more educated households may be able to avoid those costs by employing somewhat complicated nancial tools, many people belonging to the lower classes or liv- ing in rural areas lack either the knowledge or the access to those tools and are unable to maintain the purchasing power of their savings. Under those circumstances, infl ation acts like a regressive tax that hits those at the bottom of the economic ladder the hardest. One way governments have sheltered their constituents from these unwanted consequences is by indexing prices\u2014especially wages\u2014to infl ation. Colombia in particular has employed indexation widely throughout its economy , from wages to prices of selected commodities. Nonetheless, no indexation is widespread enough to truly counterbalance the effects of the infl ation \"tax.\" In particular, the tax system is never fully indexed, and thus infl ation erodes a key component of government revenues. Perhaps more importantly , wage indexation does not necessarily apply to the informal sector, which is problematic for a country like Colombia where the informal economy is large. This analysis is not the right place to discuss the merits of these arguments, in particular of the view that low infl ation is preferable because it increases the ef ciency of the economy and therefore allows for faster economic growth. It is worth noticing that, in the words of Bernanke et al (1999), \"obtaining direct empirical con rmation of a link between infl ation and the overall economic performance of the economy is very dif cult.\" Sarel (1996) found that negative effects increase sharply at higher rates of infl ation but are not signi cant at rates of infl ation below 8% or so; other research points out that most of the costs as- sociated with high infl ation are derived from the greater unpredictability of price associated with infl ation (Judson and Orphanides, 1996; Hutchison and Walsh, 1996). In any case, early estimates of a growth effect caused by Colombian disinfl ation suggest that decreasing infl ation by 10% would increase the long-term rate of growth by 0.5% (Uribe, 1994). 2 THE ROLE OF THE CENTRAL BANK It is safe to conclude that central banks ultimately are unable to provide for long-term economic growth, and that their usefulness is limited in the long run to the control of infl ation. The proviso in the long run needs to be stressed. Central banks have a very important role in stabilizing the economic cycle. Expansionary monetary policy does help the economy to exit a recession faster and less painfully . But these short-term bene ts must be weighted against long-term effects, where expansionary pushes invari- ably lead to accelerating prices and where growth is not determined by central bank actions. Experience shows that often times this balance is not maintained. The pressure to obtain short-term gains while disregarding the potential for long-term losses has been so widespread that economists talk Explorations: An Undergraduate Research Journal 200332Alfredo Burlando of an endemic infl ation bias among central banks. This bias is dynamically inef cient, and therefore it needs to be corrected in one way or another. The literature on this subject is very large, and discussion on the best measures needed to effectively manage central banking is vigorously ongoing. In this dis-cussion I will focus on two solutions that have been quite popular among economists and Colombian policymakers. The rst solution is based on the assumption that, in order to reduce the risk of infl ation bias, the central bank needs on the one hand to be alleviated from the pressures coming from groups interested in short-term solutions, and on the other to have a stronger incentive to focus on the long run. One way to achieve the rst objective is to induce the government to relinquish its control over monetary policy , and to set up a body-a central bank-with the capacity and the independence necessary to control this side of policy . This step is necessary because the government is often too dependent on the political cycle. Elections are won if the ruling party has brought prosperity to the country , and prosperity can often be achieved (for a short period of time) with a monetary expansion. An independent central bank, free from the political cycle, is thus more likely to be free from infl ation bias; furthermore, its policies will be viewed with greater con dence and the bank itself will gain greater credibility . However, this is just one of many issues that have been (and still are) ercely debated. For example, a former Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve claimed, \"I do not know a shred of evidence that supports [the credibility hypothesis]. ...[T]he available evidence does not suggest that more independent central banks are rewarded with more favorable short-run trade-offs\" (Blinder, 1998). Another issue that is vigorously debated involves the conditions that de ne independence for a central bank. According to Blinder (1998), independence means two things: that the bank is free to pursue its goals, and that its decisions are not easily overturned by any branch of the government. The bene ts of an independent central bank have been analyzed in the literature, suggesting through econometric analysis that the more independent a central bank is, the lower the infl ation rate. Other theories suggest that disinfl ation is less costly when pursued by an inde- pendent institution. The second solution to infl ation bias is that a central bank openly aligns its monetary policy with the long-term goal of price stability . Infl ation targeting has received considerable attention as a tool to assist a central bank in reaching this goal. By publicly declaring a certain target for the infl ation rate, the central bank exposes itself to criticism in case of failure, and therefore enforces discipline while at the same time improving communication between policymakers and the public (Bernanke et al, 1999). Setting targets for the infl ation rate may also lower costs as the bank pursues its defl ationary policies, and may therefore be well suited to countries that are searching for ways to reduce infl ation and build up credible monetary institutions. The Case of Colombia THE COLOMBIAN DISINFLATION PROGRAM Although I indicated earlier that Colombia suffered from high infl ation for several decades, it should be said that its neighbors have been in far worse shape. Before the 1990s, Brazil had gone through four unsuccessful disinfl ation programs and had even had spurts of hyperinfl ation; Argentina was suffering political and social turmoil caused in part by accelerating prices; Bolivia was coping with the worse reces-sion and the highest hyperinfl ation since those that plagued the German Weimar Republic in the 1920s; and Peru, Venezuela, and Ecuador were also battling high infl ation. With an infl ation rate of 22-23% per year, Colombia in comparison looked like an island of stability . However, as the nineties progressed the average infl ation rate in the region fell dramatically , to the point at which Colombia became one of the highest infl ation economies in Latin America (see Fig. 1). In 1991, with an unprecedented push to liber-Explorations: An Undergraduate Research Journal 200333The Colombian Monetary Policy Experience: Attempts at Disinfl ation, 1990-2002 alize the economy came also a new commitment to ght an annual infl ation rate that had been stuck in the low 20% range for the previous two decades (Clavijo, 2000). The ght for lower infl ation and a more effective monetary policy was included in a far reaching constitutional reform, which incorporated several important provisions aimed at strengthening the cred- ibility of the Banco de la Rep\u00fablica , the Colombian Central Bank. At the time of the reform, the Central Bank was still an integral part of the government, its functions limited to easing macroeconomic policy (Gomez, Uribe and Vargas, 2002). According to the Banco de la Republica website, before the 1991 reform the members of the monetary directorate ( Junta Monetaria ) were also ministers and functionaries in the executive branch (http://www.banrep.gov.co/banco/histor4c.htm). Provisions in the 1991 constitution were intended to increase the independence of the Banco de la Rep\u00fablica . It separated the Banco from the executive branch and established an independent board of directors ( Junta Directiva ) composed of seven members: a General Director, the Minister of the Economy , and ve additional board members. This arrangement sought to guarantee freedom from political pressure (http://www.banrep.gov.co/banco/histor4d.htm), even though it will be shown that the end result did not live up to expectations. Perhaps of equal importance, the Bank was given an unequivocal new function from the constitution: \"The State, through the Banco de la Rep\u00fablica, must preserve the purchasing power of the currency .\" In September 1991, the Central Bank for the rst time chose an infl ation target of 19.9%. In 1992, Law 32 further clari- ed that the Bank's responsibility was to stabilize prices and that it must adopt an infl ation target that was lower than the observed infl ation (Gomez, 2002). Despite the liberal economic reforms, the new constitution forced new spending from the govern- ment, and throughout the nineties the government sustained large de cits that raised its share of spend- ing from 24.4% of GDP in 1990 to 34.8% ten years later (Gomez, Uribe and Vargas, 2002). Such de cits were nanced with higher taxes, privatization of government services, and a ballooning debt, conditions that pressured the Central Bank into maintaining low interest rates in order to ease government nanc- es-even when those rates were inconsistent with infl ationary objectives. The lack of support by policymakers for defl ationary policies that would hurt government nances was accompanied by a similar lack of enthusiasm from the public. The (arguably) mild Colombian infl a- tion had been remarkably stable, and Colombians were used to it. Widespread wage indexation, both formal and informal, maintained the purchasing power of most citizens. In addition, the costs of disinfl a- tion were considered by most to be excessive, and there was little support to institute a disinfl ationary program, which needs to have widespread support and credibility if it is to succeed. Since both of these prerequisites were absent, any disinfl ation program would have been a very costly affair. Perhaps one reason why the Banco de la Rep\u00fablica suffered from low credibility has to do with its institutional structure. Because the independent Junta Directiva includes the Minister of the Economy , it is subject to some degree of executive interference. Even the Junta 's current General Director, Miguel Urrutia, admits that the Minister of the Economy holds a certain power over the Bank's decisions: \"[I]f the Minister of the Economy strongly opposes a measure agreed [to] by the majority , the board generally reconsiders the issue, because obviously if [he] publicly declares his disagreement, public controversy and uncertainty in the markets may develop\" (Urrutia, 1999). It comes at no surprise, then, that despite being one of the rst countries to make public its target infl ation rate, Colombia failed to meet its targets for quite some time. As we can see in Figure 2, infl ation did not reach the targeted rate for several years, until 1994. In 1996, the Central Bank missed its objective by 4.6%, but that result was not attributed to a grave policy error (Gomez, Uribe and Vargas, 2002). In fact, reaching the target infl ation was not yet the overriding objective of the Bank; rather than infl ation targets comprising one part of a more comprehensive program to lower infl ation, they instead were being used simply for macroeconomic programming.Explorations: An Undergraduate Research Journal 200334Alfredo Burlando MONETARY POLICY STRATEGY In contrast to Colombia, Brazil and Bolivia were able to complete the disinfl ation process in a matter of months. As I have argued, the costs of such sudden and decisive disinfl ation would have been very high in the case of Colombia. To avoid those costs, policymakers chose to use intermedi-ate infl ation targets instead of an ultimate infl ation target, in order to spread the costs over a longer period of time. Only in January of 2001 did the Bank nally choose an ultimate infl ation target of 3%, a rate that the Board must have deemed would be low enough to minimize the costs traditionally associated with infl ation (high transaction costs, high uncertainty , erosion of purchasing power) but high enough to allow for expansionary mon- etary policy during recessions. The strategies adopted to reach these goals varied over time and had different degrees of success. Initially , the policy strategy had three \"anchors.\" The rst and most important one was the infl ation target discussed above. The second anchor was inter- mediate monetary targets, and the third was the exchange rate. The coexistence of both monetary base corridors and exchange rate crawling bands was often prob- lematic, and the Banco de la Rep\u00fablica had no clear policy in regard to the ranking between the two. Gomez, Uribe and Vargas (2002) state in a recent internal analysis, \"[A]t some point it was announced that, in case of confl ict, the highest priority would be given to the monetary targets.\" However, in its 1998 brie ng to Congress, the Bank admitted that \"under certain circumstances there can be a confl ict between the ful llment of the crawling band and the corridor of the monetary base. Under these circum- stances this last one can be temporarily sacri ced with the objective of preserving exchange rate stability , just as it happened in 1998\" (qtd. in Clavijo, 2000, p. 22). It is then possible to say that \"the big movements in interest rates pursued different objectives at different times\" (Gomez and Julio, 2000), and that the strategy of the Banco de la Rep\u00fablica is therefore reminiscent of that employed by the European Central Bank, which, although widely believed to use interest rate targeting, in reality stresses the importance of monetary bases. Estimating a Policy Rule for Colombia THE MEANING OF A MONETARY POLICY RULE The discussion above raises the question of whether Colombia is an infl ation-targeting country-that is, whether it conducts monetary policy based on an infl ation-targeting framework. With the aid of a policy rule, we can determine an initial answer to the question. We can establish whether the Board of Directors' decisions can be represented by a single equation, which economists call a reaction function or policy rule . This equation assumes that the Central Bank, on average, behaves according to a rule. That is, it chooses the interest rate (which it controls) in response to changes in other economic variables such as output, prices and exchange rates, among others (Taylor, 1999). Under speci c circumstances that will be tested later, a policy rule works as an \"automatic stabilizer\" for infl ation around its target: if infl ation deviates from the target, the Central Bank acts in ways designed to return the rate to its target. Figure 2. Infl ation rates and infl ation targets, 1989-2002.Explorations: An Undergraduate Research Journal 200335The Colombian Monetary Policy Experience: Attempts at Disinfl ation, 1990-2002 It is important to remember that the assumption that the Central Bank behaves according to a rule is theoretical, since policymakers generally have discretionary powers for their policy choices and respond to external factors not included in the rule. In Colombia's case, policy has been changing as Central Bank objectives, goals and pressures have shifted through time, and therefore the assumption of a time-invari-ant rule does not accord with actual practice. Nonetheless, the reaction function can be employed to uncover whether on average the Central Bank, given its policy objectives and changing goals, behaved in a way that ensured disinfl ation. We can also mitigate against the effects resulting from the assumption of a changeless rule by considering the possibility that, at some point in time (to be determined within the model), the rule did change in a signi cant way . We can then analyze two different sub-periods and gain some additional insight into the Central Bank's policy stances. THE MODEL The rationale behind the rule is that, based on information obtained about infl ation rate and the overall performance of the economy (summarized by gures on the output gap), the Central Bank choos- es a short-term interest rate consistent with the targeted infl ation rate and potential output. A very simple formula for this type of rule was rst suggested by John Taylor (1993) in his seminal work, and therefore is called the present-looking T aylor rule . It takes the following form: = + ( t -t*) + (yt - yt*) + t. (1) where r* is the interest rate target, is the long run equilibrium nominal rate, t is the infl ation rate, t and * are the infl ation and the target infl ation rates, and yt and y*t are output and potential output, respectively . Note that (yt - yt*) is, then, the output gap. Note also that the interest rate rule depends only on the output and infl ation gaps, a direct consequence of the assumption that the Central Bank operates by a quadratic loss function that has infl ation and output gap as its terms.3 The analysis of this rule involves looking at two critical values for the and coef cients. A 1% de- viation of infl ation from its target will prompt the Central Bank to change the interest rate by ; a similar change in output will also change the interest rate by . In particular, we are looking for evidence that > 1 and that > 0. A lower than one is a sign that the policy is ineffective in ghting infl ation and that the Central Bank may not be employing an infl ation-targeting regime. On the other hand, a positive indicates that the Central Bank is concerned with even short-term fl uctuations in output and responds to them correctly-lowering interest rates when the economy is in a slump and raising them when it is experiencing a boom. While John Taylor's model postulates that the Central Bank uses the latest information available on infl ation, interest rates, and output to formulate policy , Clarida, Gal\u00ed and Gertler (1998) hypothesize that the nature of decision-making is forward-looking, meaning that the Central Bank uses its best guess about the future run of economic variables to choose the optimal policy . In their study of the behavior of G7 central banks, they postulate a forward-looking model of the form: r* t -t+n*) + (E[yt+nI t] - yt+n*) (2) where the interest rate at time t depends on the expected infl ation and output gaps at time t+n, condi- tional on the information available at time t. Using model (2) and introducing an interest rate partial adjustment mechanism, Clarida, Gal\u00ed and Gertler (1998) estimate the following equation: Explorations: An Undergraduate Research Journal 200336Alfredo Burlando rt = 1 - y*t+n ) + rt-1 + t (3) The expected values have been substituted with the realized infl ation and output gaps; the error term t is a linear combination of the forecast errors and an exogenous disturbance vt: t = - (1 - v (E[t+nI t] -t+n*) + (E[yt+nI t] - yt+n*) } + vt (4) .The Central Bank in this model is forward-looking: it looks at predictions about future infl ation and future output gaps to choose the current optimal interest rate. It has been argued that the forward-look- ing assumption is a necessary condition for a rational, infl ation-targeting Central Bank (Svensson, 1996, 1997; Bernanke and Woodford, 1997). However, it is not wise to completely rule out a present-looking rule; for example, Taylor (1993) has shown that a present-looking rule for the United States closely fol-lows the Fed Funds rate quite closely , 4 and is therefore rich in hindsight. In this essay , I will show that the present-looking analysis replicates the key ndings of the forward-looking rule, but it has the added advantage of being robust to changes in speci cation. THE VARIABLES Before we examine the actual estimate based on the model, it is important to look at the data em- ployed. Choosing a certain data series over another has important consequences; foremost among these is that it could lead to biased and inconsistent estimators and invalid con dence intervals. For this analy- sis, I obtained and am using the same data series employed by the Banco de la Rep\u00fablica in its research and policy-making. The interbank interest rate. The interbank rate regulates the market for overnight loans between banks and nancial institutions. In line with the available research on monetary policy rules, I am assum- ing for the purposes of this analysis that the Central Bank has perfect control over this rate, and uses it to expand and contract the liquidity in the nancial markets. Through the yield curve and other complex transmission mechanisms, this change in short-term liquidity reaches the real economy , thereby bringing changes in infl ation and output. The infl ation rate. The infl ation rate that this analysis considers represents core infl ation, de ned as the level of infl ation of all goods excluding food. The important exclusion of food from the CPI of ref- erence is problematic: like most people living in developing nations, Colombians spend a large share on food-a hefty 30% of the Colombian CPI basket (Gomez and Julio, 2000). However, since food infl ation is random, and since I am using the same data that the Bank uses, the exclusion is not as important for policy formulations. The output gap. The output gap provides a helpful measure of the deviations of output from its po- tential; potential output generally refers to the level of real GDP (or, for a growing economy , the level of growth of GDP) that allows for a constant infl ation level and a constant unemployment rate. Deviations of real GDP from its potential will either increase infl ation and decrease unemployment, or decrease in- fl ation at the cost of higher unemployment. Thus, the gap provides a useful tool in determining whether the economy is growing too quickly or too slowly . Observing the behavior of GDP is not a terribly dif cult exercise, since it is generally computed every quarter. 5 However, because potential output can not be observed, it needs to be derived. The Banco de la Rep\u00fablica employs two methods to do so. The rst, the Cobb Douglas method, assumes that the economy behaves like a Cobb Douglas production function (see Gomez, Uribe, and Vargas, 2002 for a detailed description of the derivation of the gap). The second, which the Bank's researchers began em-Explorations: An Undergraduate Research Journal 200337The Colombian Monetary Policy Experience: Attempts at Disinfl ation, 1990-2002 Figure 3. Output gap, quadratic trend and Cobb Douglas method. ploying in addition to Cobb Douglas in the mid-nineties, is called the Kalman method. Because the use of a Kalman trend does not have signi cant effects on the estimation of the rule-in particular, it does not change the value of the coef cients-the results in this analysis are based on the Cobb Douglas method (see Fig. 3). One problem that arises in utilizing the Cobb Douglas structural gap is the frequency of the series. The model assumed employs monthly data, but the gap is available only in quarterly frequency . In order to obtain monthly gures I have linearly interpolated the data; this manipulation is legitimate under the assumption that the output gap does not change signi cantly from one month to the next. There are other ways to compute an output gap on a monthly basis; for example, most researchers use the monthly industrial production index (IPI) as a proxy for the GDP . 6 The output gap can then be approximated by the deviations of the log of IPI from the estimated quadratic trend. This method has been employed by Clarida, Gal\u00ed and Gertler (1998) to measure the gap for the six countries in their study; it has also been used in estimations of policy rules in Mexico and Colombia (\"Monetary Policy Rules\"; Bernal, 2002). The use of the quadratic trend is justi ed in the American case by the close relationship with the structural trend developed by the Department of Commerce and by the length of the IPI index, which spans 60 years of economic activity . Use of the IPI in the case of Colombia, however, would be ill-advised. The IPI began to be reported in 1990, and thus it barely covers one Colombian business cycle. The quadratic trend shows itself to be wholly inadequate. The output gap computed using the trend is not even capable of highlighting the profound 1999 recession. Any estimates obtained using this tool would therefore be biased and inconsistent and, as demonstrated in the estimations of policy rules done by Bernal (2002), would likely portray a completely different picture than what is shown here. Explorations: An Undergraduate Research Journal 200338Alfredo Burlando THE EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE Examining the infl ation and interest rates in Figure 4 reveals some interesting patterns. We can observe that until 1995 the interest rate shows a particularly erratic behavior around the infl ation rate. In some years (e.g., in 1990) the interest rate remains above the infl ation rate, which means that the real rate is positive. During other periods the interest rate is below the infl ation rate, thus implying a nega- tive real rate. It is clear that during this period the real rate, on average, remains very low , raising the possibility that until 1995 the central bank was involved in a prolonged expansionary policy . In 1995, beginning with a 150% rise in interest rates between October and December, the pattern changes drasti-cally . From that date until the last couple of years in the sample the interest rate remains signi cantly above the infl ation rate. The positive real rates suggest that the Banco de la Rep\u00fablica , perhaps aiming to reduce the infl ation rate, imposed a tighter control on its supply of liquidity . Based solely on this graph, however, we cannot conclude that there has been a change in policy . Higher real rates might also have resulted from a heated economy that was producing above its potential output. The role of the output gap in the selection of the optimal rate might further explain why real rates fall in 1999 and at some point in the latter part of the graph even turn negative. In order to truly understand the behavior of the Banco de la Rep\u00fablica we then need to turn to the estimate of the model, in both its present and forward-looking models. THE PRESENT-LOOKING TAYLOR RULE The present-looking Taylor rule has been estimated using ordinary least squares. Table 1 summa- rizes the estimated output.7 The table shows that the coef cients for and behave as expected, with values of 1.09 and 1.56, respectively . The result suggests that the Colombian Central Bank has generally enforced its infl ation Figure 4. Infl ation, infl ation target, interest An Undergraduate Research Colombian Monetary Policy Experience: Attempts at Disinfl ation, 1990-2002 targets by raising the interest rates just enough to offset infl ationary pressures. However, because the Wald test rejects the hypothesis that is statistically different from 1, we cannot con rm that the bank was 'soft.' Not surprisingly , the Banco de la Rep\u00fablica seems very concerned with output movements. The coef cient of 1.56 translates into the interest rate falling 1.56 percentage points for every point fall in the output gap, a ratio that is fairly large compared with the more modest values found in G7 economies. Clearly , the Banco de la Rep\u00fablica is not as conservative as the Bundersbank or the Federal Reserve; how- ever, as mentioned above, there is not a right or wrong value of , and the high value of this coef cient can be explained by the status of Colombia as a developing country . FORWARD-LOOKING ANALYSIS The forward-looking analysis presents several technical challenges that are absent in the present- looking analysis. In order to provide an estimate of a forward-looking rule, equation (3) would need to use the same forecasts that were available to the Bank on the expected output gap and expected infl ation. Unfortunately , this information is not available. In order to overcome such a dif culty , Clarida, Gali and Gertler (1998) estimate the forward rule with the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM). The base-line GMM model uses an instrument set u t that includes lagged values of the output gap, infl ation and interest rates-all information known to the Central Bank when making policy decisions. The GMM then employs the instrument set to create empirical forecasts of infl ation and output, keeping the interest rate exogenous. With these forecasts in hand, it is then possible to estimate a rule. The estimated rule derives again from equation (3), and appears as r t = ( 1 - v ) + ( 1 - )( - - y*t+n) + 1rt-1 + 2rt-2 + t (5) where an extra lag of the interest rate has been added to correct for autocorrelation. Before proceeding to the estimate, the horizon of the infl ation and output forecast must be speci ed, or, in other words, n must be assigned a value. The forecast horizon employed by the Banco de la Rep\u00fablica is unknown, but an educated guess is that it ranges from one quarter to one year ahead. Clarida, Gali and Gertler (1998) suggest that central banks generally are more likely to employ a one year horizon; in any case, results for n = 3, 6, 9 and 12 (where n is de ned in months out of the year, and thus, the estimation is conducted quarterly) are estimated and reported in Table 2. Clearly , the results vary considerably . The values range from 0.361 to 1.541, depending on the ho- rizon chosen. Furthermore, an additional lag for the interest rate is needed to obtain non-autocorrelated results. Unfortunately , none of the values are robust to changes in the number of lags; therefore, we can't have con dence in the result because the values are too susceptible to the infl uence from the number of lags chosen.Table 1. Present-looking Taylor rule. 1 2 R2 1.09 1.56 0.24 0.42 0.70 (0.16) (0.214) (0.07) (0.07) Explorations: An Undergraduate Research Journal 200340Alfredo Burlando Table 2. GMM estimation, t periods This table exempli es the problems of using GMM for these kinds of calculations. GMM is quite sensitive to changes in speci cations of the model, a sensitivity that is problematic given that we know neither what the true model is nor whether the estimated forecasts are unbiased estimators of the true forecasts. Still, some observations are possible: if the Banco employs a forward-looking target, then it must employ a horizon that ranges between six months and one year, since for those horizons we obtain a coef cient above one. Furthermore, the main result of the present-looking Taylor rule does not change: Wald tests con rm that the coef cient is never statistically different from 1; thus the viewpoint about the \"softness\" of the central bank remains valid. With this reassurance, from this point forward I assume that the \"true\" model is a forward-looking Taylor rule with a year-long horizon. Further issues TESTING STRUCTURAL POLICY CHANGES Perhaps the most striking element of the experience in Colombia has been the variability in mon- etary policy . As I argued earlier, Colombian policymakers have changed their stance on policy several times, quite often because their hands were forced either by external forces such as those resulting from international nancial crises or by internal pressures coming from the executive branch. Figure 4 sug- gested that the Bank has become more focused in its task of securing low infl ation as prescribed by the constitutional mandate; this possibility might lead us to believe that tougher standards were introduced in the mid-nineties. When I tested this hypothesis, to my initial surprise I reached an entirely different conclusion. The Taylor rule presents itself as a handy tool to analyze changes in the stance of policymakers. The analysis uses a very simple procedure, in which the sample is divided into two sub-periods; a Chow test for structural changes is performed to test the hypothesis that the two sub-periods had two differ-ent rules; and then the two sub-periods are independently analyzed. Important care needs to be taken in choosing the date upon which the break is supposed to have happened. Ideally , we would know the speci c date that marked the change in policy . If that is not possible, it would be helpful to have in mind several possibilities for that date, such as the date on which a new Minister of the Economy was intro-duced, or the date on which several members of the Junta Directiva were replaced, or perhaps more obvi- ously the month in which the currency was allowed to fl oat. Once these possibilities are identi ed, they can be tested with statistical processes and the best candidate can be chosen. 9 Lacking the resources or the knowledge to avail ourselves of either of these two alternative meth-Explorations: An Undergraduate Research Journal 200341The Colombian Monetary Policy Experience: Attempts at Disinfl ation, 1990-2002 Figure 5. Sum of Squared Residuals for Regression 13. ods, we can rely on a third option, which is to let the data guide the selection of the breakpoint.10 In this case I considered every point between January 1995 and December 1998 as a possible candidate for the selection. The choice of the two endpoints was somewhat arbitrary , but included the years '96-97, which are the years, I would argue, where it is most likely that a break occurred. For each point, the following regression is estimated: r* t = + 1( t -*) + 2 D( t -*) + 1(yt - yt*) D(yt - yt*) + vt. (6) where D is a dummy variable that takes the value of 0 if the observation falls before the breakpoint and takes the value of 1 for every point after it ( (1995:01, 1998:12 ) ). As an example, assume that we believe that a change in policy happened in March 1996. The above equation then will tell us that, before that date, the Central Bank reacted to infl ation and output gap ac- cording to the estimated parameters 1 and 1. However, from that point on, the new policy of the Central Bank kicks in, and policymakers react according to the parameters 1+ 2 and regression. Explorations: An Undergraduate Research Journal 200342 In order to determine the most likely point at which such an event took place, I have collected the sum of squared errors for each one of the 49 regressions conducted and organized them in Figure 5. The equation with the lowest sum of squared errors is the equation with the correct breaking point. Such a point falls in December of 1997, at a time of strong international turbulence and uncertainty . The estimation output is shown in Table 3.A Wald test shows that this point is signi cant, and allows us, with 99% con dence, to reject the null hypothesis that there is no break. This estimation output tells an interesting story . Before the end of 1997, the Central Bank tried to maintain some sort of nominal anchor (even though the result is statistically very weak). In the mind of policymakers, infl ation and output shared a similar weight. However, this result changes dramatically after 1997. Infl ation targets lose their importance (a nega- tive value for is counterintuitive, so we assume that is zero). Instead, the importance given to the output gap grows disproportionately , ballooning to a above 5 points. The result may seem counterintuitive. Serious disinfl ation took place only in the second part of the sample, a result that may seem inconsistent with loose monetary policy . Indeed, it is entirely possible that the Banco de la Rep\u00fablica shifted its focus away from infl ation targeting in the past few years as a result of those same events. The contraction of the economy beginning in 1999 has been severe, and the country has not yet quite recovered from it. In light of these events, we can imagine that the excessively loose actions of the Banco de la Rep\u00fablica are a consequence of exceptional years of acute hardship and represent a clear attempt by the Bank to speed up the recovery , regardless of what the consequences for infl ation may be. If this interpretation is correct, then the estimated reaction function for the Central Bank since 1997 does not represent the \"true\" reaction function for Colombia; rather, it is representative of a particular period where extraordinary measures were taken in an effort to counteract extraordinary events. In order to truly gauge what the normal behavior of the Banco would be during normal times, we then should look at the reaction function estimated from the years 1991 to 1997. During this period, the Central Bank had a clear policy of infl ation targeting, strictly enforced by the exchange rate band. It assumed that, once the situation returned to normalcy in Colombia and the country returned to the healthy growth rates of the past, it could then revert to its \"usual\" policies of strictly enforcing the infl ation target. Obviously , the Bank is running a considerable risk by maintaining a very liquid market; infl ationary expectations may rise before the recession ends, and Colombia may even return to a period of stagfl ation. This hypothetical scenario is strongly reminiscent of the American experience in the 1970s, when stop-go policies adopted by the Federal Reserve often fueled infl ation to a point at which high interest rates had to be adopted and then subsequently lowered substantially in order to counteract the impending recession, to the point that neither low infl ation nor high growth was achieved. Conclusion Colombian monetary policy offers itself up to mixed reviews. Following the economic liberalization of the early 1990s, the Central Bank assumed a new leading role in the management of monetary policy . Free from direct interference from the government and other interest groups, policymakers at this insti-tution were able to focus their attention on organizing a workable policy framework to address the task of disinfl ation. However, the Bank remained hampered both by indirect pressures from the government and by citizens' opposition to a costly disinfl ation. Furthermore, the Banco de la Rep\u00fablica maintained a set of policies and intermediate targets that ultimately confl icted, sometimes with each other and other times with the longer-term targets. Alfredo BurlandoExplorations: An Undergraduate Research Journal 200343 The reaction function then becomes a useful tool to analyze the net outcome of these different ele- ments. In particular, it is helpful in addressing the issue of whether Colombia is, on average, targeting the infl ation rate. The analysis of this function con rms that the Central Bank has enforced the infl ation tar- get as the nominal anchor for the economy . However, this conclusion is statistically weak, meaning that the Bank has been far from rigorous in its attempts. The rst major objective of the Banco de la Rep\u00fablica has been to lower the infl ation rate from the heights of the late eighties and early nineties to OECD levels of 3% per year; but the institution has proved to be in no hurry to reach such a result. This analysis con rms that one of the Central Bank's strategies was to target the infl ation rate by means of the exchange rate. Throughout the early nineties, the country maintained some sort of rigidity on the exchange market, rst xing the peso to a sliding peg, then allowing for ever-widening currency bands until the peso was allowed to free fl oat in 1999. The reaction function shows that this exchange rate was also a nominal anchor for the economy , even though it proved to be quite weak and subject to changes when problems (such as speculative attacks) threatened its existence. Interestingly , as the Central Bank moved away from the exchange rate anchor, the infl ation target lost importance and strength, even in a period during which these targets were nally being met. There are several possible explanations for such an occurrence. One is that the strong relationship between prices and the exchange rate caused the latter to behave like an implicit infl ation target. Under this hypothesis, any effort put forward by the Central Bank to maintain the exchange rate within certain values was bound to have a secondary effect on the infl ation rate, and therefore the toughness of the Bank's policies was a direct result of its obliga- tions to meet daily objectives. Given the lack of attention in this analysis to this speci c issue, this hy- pothesis will have to be tested in future research. A second possible explanation for the weakening of the Central Bank's resolve to ght infl ation comes from the weakness of the national economy and its fall into a grave recession in 1999. The reces-sion was accompanied by a sudden increase in job losses, a negative turn of growth of GDP per capita, and a sudden slackness in aggregate demand. As demand fell, prices began to slow down signi cantly , and the process of disinfl ation gained a speed never before seen. Given this circumstance, it is possible to infer from the hardened conditions of the economy and the ease with which disinfl ation was achieved that policymakers shifted their worries from disinfl ation to the economy . This would explain why most interest rate movements focused more on aiding an ailing economy than on keeping infl ation under check. Regardless of the reasons that the current policies were adopted, it is clear that they are not sustain- able. Infl ationary pressures will build up, and expectations will rise once again-perhaps even before the effects of the recession have been worked out. If that comes to pass, it would be best for the Banco de la Rep\u00fablica to review its commitment to challenge infl ationary forces before all the gains obtained at such a high cost disappear once again. The greatest task facing the Bank may be to nd a way to keep infl ation low now that it is so close to achieving its long-run target. . In order to do so, the Bank must realize that its current policies are not enough, and that it must seriously reconsider its objectives.

This problem may sound subtle until the case of Brazil is considered: during the period of high infl ation in the eighties, Brazil cleared more than 7 billion checks per year, averaging 28 million every day-the same quantity that American Express would clear in its worldwide operations every month (T ullio and Ronci, 1996). The costs of such arrangements can thus be huge. 2. Note that the study was conducted in 1994, before the great recession of 1999; it may therefore overestimate the bene cial effects of lowering the infl ation rate. 3. For purposes of brevity , the model presented here and its variations treat the exchange rate as exogenous. In the unabridged version of this paper, the exchange rate is shown to be signi cant and is included as part of the rule, even though its effect on policy is not large. 4. While the Fed does not have an institutional framework that forces it to adopt a target, the evidence put forth by Clarida, Gal\u00ed and Gertler (1998) supports the view that it ercely enforces an implicit target. The comparison is thus appropriate. 5. While GDP is observed quarterly in all OECD countries, this is not true for Colombia, where GDP is measured annually . The Banco de la Rep\u00fablica converts the annual measures into quarterly measures using statistical methods and other data observed in the economy throughout the year. 6. Apparently , some Colombian researchers have even employed output in the cement industry as a proxy for GDP . 7. I have slightly modi ed equation (3), including an extra lag to correct for autocorrelation. The Lagrange multiplier test rejects the hypothesis that the modi ed model is autocorrelated; the estimated coef cients are robust to zero, one or two lags. 8. The instrument set u t is de ned possible breakpoint is not too challenging in the case of Colombia. In particular, modi cations of the exchange market are a direct consequence of changes in monetary policy . For example, the fl oating of the peso changed the policy of the Banco de la Rep\u00fablica, and therefore ought to be considered as a possible breaking point. Unfortunately , there are not enough observations to provide ef cient estimates and valid hypothesis testing. 10. I thank Professor Oscar Jorda for suggesting the method followed here.

Yu Abstract The graphical expansions of non-commutative integrals over self-ad-joint elements of certain types of Clifford Algebras are given in terms of power series over ribbon graphs and M\u00f6bius graphs. The coef cient of each term in the series depends only on the topological type of the ribbon or M\u00f6bius graph, and these formulae are computed explicitly in this paper. Introduction The asymptotic expansions of the matrix integrals over real symmetric, complex hermitian, and qua-ternionic self-adjoint matrices have been obtained using Feynman diagram expansions and ribbon graphs [3, 5]. Informally , this means that an integral over a class of matrices with entries in some algebra can be written as an in nite sum over graphs drawn on closed surfaces. The results have been generalized to matrix integrals with values in group algebras over nite groups [6] and to those with values in von Neumann algebras, which are a more general class of non-commuta-tive algebras [7]. Each matrix integral can be written as an in nite series where each term corresponds to a graph drawn over either an orientable or a non-orientable surface. What makes these expansions more interesting is that the coef cient of each term in the series depends only on the topological type of the corresponding graph, and hence may give us some information about topological properties of the surface on which the graph is drawn. The most general result obtained is displayed in Theorem 1.1 from [7]. (see page 48) Some examples of von Neumann algebras are the Clifford algebras, which have many applications, especially in physics. In the case of Clifford algebras Cl n,0 with a positive de nite quadratic form [2], the coef cients in the graphical expansion of the integrals can be formulated in simple ex- plicit formulae involving only the dimension n of the underlying vector space for Cln,0. The purpose of this paper is to give those explicit formulae with the proofs. Our main result is displayed in Theorem 1.2, which was formulated using the same notations as in Theorem 1.1.Explorations: An Undergraduate Research Journal 200348Josephine T. Yu Theorem 1.2.

For a real von Neumann algebra A, we have Explorations: An Undergraduate Research Journal 200349Graphical Expansion of Matrix Integrals with Values in a Clifford Algebra Ribbon Graphs and M\u00f6bius Graphs An undirected graph is a 3-tuple ( V , E, i ), where V is called the set of vertices, E the set of edges, and i : E (V x V) / the incidence relation of the edges; i.e., i(e) = {u1, u2} means that the edge e is incident to the vertices u1 and u2. A graph can be represented pictorially by a dot for each vertex and an arc con- necting two vertices for every edge incident to those vertices. A (traditional) graph isomorphism between two graphs is a pair of bijections between vertices and between edges that preserves the incidence relations. More precisely , for two graphs, a graph isomorphism is a pair of bijections such that if , then The edge re nement of a graph is a new graph obtained by adding a new vertex on every edge, hence splitting each edge into two edges. More precisely , it is the graph , where the new vertex set V' is the disjoint union of the original vertices and the new vertices, one on each edge, so The new edge set E' is the disjoint union of two copies of the original edges, because there are two new edges for every original edge, so The new incidence re-lation is , because every new edge is incident to an original vertex and a new vertex. We can then de ne the group Aut() of automorphisms of a graph to be the group of traditional graph isomorphisms from the edge of re nement of to itself. The edges in the edge re nement of are called half-edges of . The number of half-edges incident to a vertex is called the valency or degree of that vertex. At every vertex, we can de ne a cyclic ordering of half vertices incident to that vertex. An ordering of the vertices is in the form , and in a cyclic ordering = . A graph with this cyclic structure at every vertex is called a ribbon graph . There are ( j - 1)! distinct cyclic half-edges at every j- valent vertex. A M\u00f6bius graph is a ribbon graph with a coloring on every edge. A vertex fl ip operation at a vertex of a M\u00f6bius graph is an operation that reverses the cyclic order of the half-edges incident to the vertex and changes the coloring of every edge incident to the vertex. T wo M\u00f6bius graphs obtained from one another by a nite sequence of vertex fl ip operations are identi ed. A ribbon graph automorphism AutR() of a ribbon graph is the sub- group of the automorphism group of the underlying graph that preserves the cyclic ordering of half-edges at every vertex in . Similarly , a M\u00f6bius graph automorphism Aut M() of a M\u00f6bius graph is the subgroup of the auto- morphic group of the underlying graph that preserves the cyclic orderings and the vertex fl ip operations on . Consider a ribbon graph = (V, E, i, c ), where c is the cyclic ordering given to the vertices. As in Figure 2.2, Figure 2.1. Two different ribbon graphs of the same underlying graph. Underlying graph Ribbon Graphs Explorations: An Undergraduate Research Journal 200350Josephine T. Yu we can represent a half edge as a pair of arcs with opposite directions. These pairs of arcs come together at a vertex and are connected in a orientation-pre-serving manner as shown in the gure. The other end of a half edge, which is not connected to a vertex, is connect-ed to another half edge. There are two ways to connect the arcs, orientation- preserving and orientation-reversing ways, as seen in Figure 2.3. For a ribbon graph, the half-edges must be connected in an orientation-preserving way . If we allow the half-edges to connect without regard for their orientation, we get a M\u00f6bius graph. Figure 2.3. Two different ways to connect two half-edges. We have realized the ribbon and M\u00f6bius graphs as oriented or non-orientable surfaces with bound- aries. The boundary of a ribbon graph is made of oriented closed curves. By attaching an oriented surface with a boundary to every \"hole\" made by one of the closed curves, we get an oriented compact surface S without a boundary . The boundary of a M\u00f6bius graph is made of oriented or non-orientable closed curves. By attaching an orientable or non-orientable surface to each boundary component, we get a compact Riemann surface S that is either orientable or non-orientable. Each of the surfaces attached is called a face of the ribbon graph . We denote by f( ) the number of faces of , e() = |E|, and v() = |V|. The Euler characteristic (S) of the surface S is de ned as If S is orientable, then where g is the genus of the surface S. If S is non-orientable, then where k is the cross-cap genus of S.

Explorations: An Undergraduate Research Journal 200351Graphical Expansion of Matrix Integrals with Values in a Clifford Algebra Feynman Diagrams Let S be a nite set with even cardinality . A way of partitioning elements of S into disjoint pairs (of two elements each) is called a pairing scheme of that set. Let ~ be an arbitrary equivalence relation on S. Then we can consider the equivalence classes in ( S/~) as vertices of a graph and the pair { s1, s2} as an edge incident to the equivalence classes [ s1] and [ s2]. Hence, each pairing scheme of S gives rise to a graph. If we de ne cyclic ordering on each of the equivalence classes, then the graph becomes a ribbon graph, and each element of S corresponds to a half edge of the ribbon graph. See Figure 3.1. Figure 3.1. A pairing scheme and the corresponding Feynman Diagram.Partition of the elements with cyclic ordering The corresponding ribbon graph (a Feynman Diagram) (A) A pairing scheme Figure 3.2.

Explorations: An Undergraduate Research Journal 200352Josephine T. Yu Suppose |S| = 2m, and ~ partitions S into vj subsets of j elements each, for Then the semi-direct product acts on the set of pairing schemes S and X as follows. Each permutes the vj equivalent classes in S/~ with j elements, and each permutes the elements in each equivalent class of j elements. Figure 3.2 shows the action of on a pairing scheme with a sin- gle vertex. The action of permuting vertices is similar. Notice that this action does not change the graph corresponding to the pairing scheme. Hence, all the pairing schemes corresponding to the same graph have the same stabalizer subgroup under the action of G. Notice that the automorphism group of a graph , coincides with the subgroup of that is the stabilizer of each pairing scheme corresponding to . The orbit Ox of a pairing scheme x is the set of pairing schemes that correspond to the same graph as x, because one pairing scheme can be brought to another using a G-action if and only if these pairing schemes correspond to the same graph. For a set X and a group action G on X, for every we have (size of orbit) x (order of stabilizer) = (order of G) . Hence, and for a graph with (3.1) # pairing schemes corresponding to 1 If we consider the action of is the cyclic group of order j, then each orbit of G action on X is a ribbon graph because two pairing schemes can be brought from one to the other if and only if they correspond to the same graph and they have the same cyclic order of half- edges at every vertex. Then we have for a ribbon graph with (3.2) # pairing schemes corresponding to 1 Now , consider the action of is the dihedral group of order 2j. Then each orbit of G action on X is a M\u00f6bius graph because a M\u00f6bius graph allows cyclic rotation and refl ection (vertex fl ip operation) at every vertex. The following formula will be useful in later sections. For a M\u00f6bius graph (3.3) # pairing schemes corresponding to 1 Clifford Algebras Let V and W be two vector spaces over the same eld F. Then their tensor product V W is a vector space over F spanned by elements of the form v w such that for each F. Explorations: An Undergraduate Research Journal 200353 This tensor product is associative. Recall that an algebra is a vector space W over a eld F with a multiplication which turns it into a ring, such that for any c F we have Let V be an n- dimensional vector space over a eld F. For (r times), and T0(V) = F . Then the direct sum has an algebraic structure, and it is called the tensor algebra of V over F. Suppose q: VF is a quadratic form on V . That is, given a basis B of V, there is an n x n matrix A with entries in F such that for each is the coordinate vector of v with re- spect to the basis B. Let Iq(V) be the ideal in the tensor algebra T(V) generated by Then the Clifford algebra associated to V and q is de ned to be the quotient In other words, is the algebra obtained from by setting for each From now on, we will write when there is no confusion. Now , consider the Clifford algebras , where and x = Here, we will consider only Cln,0. Hence, the matrix A mentioned earlier is the n x n identity matrix In. Let be the standard basis of For any subset, of We will use the following proposition without proof, which can be found in numerous books on the subject, including [2]. Explorations: An Undergraduate Research Journal 200354Josephine T. Yu Moreover, Hence, we get For consider The term in the middle can change place with the on its left with an extra factor of -1. Then it can again change place with the and so on. Hence, after changing place j - 1 times, the is next to the leftmost . Then these two terms vanish, leaving a factor -1, hence the total contribution of the two Similarly , the two vanish, leaving a factor Continuing in this fashion, we get the formula Now , for consider turning into = Starting from each of the can be brought to the new place by inter- changing all of the 's. If is empty , then the number of (-1) factors obtained is . However, for each element interchanging two 's does not contribute anything. Thus the total contribution is and Hence, we get We will now compute the right hand side of the above equation. Let and We will consider pairs such that If j = 0, then U = I, so K = L . Hence, which is always even, so Thus, every pair in [ n] x [n] of the form ( K, K) contributes 1 to the sum, so the total contribution of the pairs of the form ( K, K) is 2n. There is a one-to-one correspondence between the pairs ( K, L) such that and between the subsets of U \\ I, because every subset corresponds to a pair There are 2j subsets of U \\ I, so that there are also 2j pairs ( K, L) such that . Notice that for a non-empty set, the number of subets with even cardinalities is the same as the num- ber of subsets with odd cardinalities. To see this, note that for any set A with |A| = n > 0, Graphical Expansion of Matrix Integrals with Values in a Clifford Algebra Now , suppose J is positive and odd. Then, is odd, and one in the pair ( K, L) is odd and the other is even. Thus, |K| |L| is even, and Hence, in this case, each pair ( K, L) contributes (-1)i to the sum on the right hand side of (4.6). Therefore, for odd j > 0, the total contribution from any I and U is (-1)i2j . Now suppose j > 0 is even. Then |K| + |L| = 2i + j is even, so |K| and |L| are either both odd or both even. Hence, |K||L| is even when |K| is even, and odd when |K| is odd. As seen above, exactly half of the subsets of U/I have even cardinalities and the other half have odd cardinalities. Therefore, among the pairs ( K,L) where and is even half of the times and odd half of the times, and so is |K||L| Hence, is equal to 1 in one-half of the cases, and -1 in the other half, so the total contribution to the sum is 0.

Yu By the de nition of the differential operator, Using (5.9), each summand in (5.8) contains differential operators. This number is also Notice from (5.6) and (5.7) that all the differential operators must be paired to get a non-zero contribution. As shown in the section on Feynman Diagrams, each pairing scheme gives a graph. Since the trace is invariant under the cyclic ordering, each pairing scheme gives a ribbon graph. From (5.7), every pair of differential operators receives a contribution Also notice that there are two ways to connect two half-edges (Fig. 2.3). Thus, we will say that an edge has a con-tribution if it is connected in an orientation-preserving way and has a contribution if it is connected in an orientation-reversing way . Therefore, both orientable and non-orientable M\u00f6bius graphs arise. There is a natural way to partition the half-edges (the differential operators) according to the term hence each vertex has the contribution Also note that there are valent vertices in the corresponding M\u00f6bius graph. Using (3.3), we get where is the automorphism group of as a M\u00f6bius graph and is the contribution made by . This is equal to the sum of contributions of all possible ways of assigning to each half vertex, so that the product is at each j-valence vertex, for every twisted edge, and for every straight edge. The only way either or can be non-zero is when K = L , so a half- edge, labeled , can only be connected to another half edge, labeled , contributing with a twisted edge or with a straight edge. This Feynman diagram expansion formula is summed over all M\u00f6bius graphs, both connected and not connected. The graphical expansion of the formal logarithm of the integral involves only the con- nected M\u00f6bius graphs as shown in [3]. Hence, Figure 5.1. Contraction and expansion of an edge. Consider contraction and expansion of edges (as shown in Fig. 5.1). Suppose and are two ver- tices of a M\u00f6bius graph , and there is an edge e between them. The contribution from is and that from is . Contracting the edge e changes to (ab). Since the product is for some M, we can write where . We can then see that Explorations: An Undergraduate Research Journal 20036061Graphical Expansion of Matrix Integrals with Values in a Clifford Algebra If , then the above formula is equal to 0 and so If M = N , then the formula in (5.10) becomes so (5.11) holds true again. Now let us consider orientable M\u00f6bius graphs, i.e., those M\u00f6bius graphs whose edges are connected in orientation-preserving ways. By contracting and expanding edges as in Figure 5.1, the M\u00f6bius graph can be brought to the ribbon graph in Figure 5.2. The above computation shows that contracting or ex-panding edges does not change the value of . Therefore, the contribution depends only on its topological type and using Since the indices can be any subset of [ n], there are 2N choices for each .

Explorations: An Undergraduate Research Journal 2003Development of the Triangular Pediment Space in Archaic Greek Temples Stefanie Ann Norris It is well known that the ancient Greeks decorated their temples with sculpture, but what is not so well known is the way in which they used their traditional tales to ll the pediment space, the triangular space under the roof of the entrance and back of the temple. The triangle form resulted in a fan-shaped composition, giving the ancient Greek artists a completely different visual approach to art and to story-telling. In contrast to reading left-to-right, as we do with vase and frieze compositions, when viewing the pediment space our eyes move from the center out. In what follows, therefore, I will describe the compositions in the same manner. The temple pediments were decorated to advertise the power of the gods to protect their cities and the people who worshiped them. Pediments provided another outlet for Greek artists to produce works that communicated the pride they had in their traditional tales and that glori ed their culture. Some of the earliest examples of temple decoration in the Greek world come from Cretan and Sicilian architec-tural sculpture. These forms lack any sort of narrative, and generally depict terracotta Gorgon heads as apotropaic (or evil-warding) symbols. Over time, the pediment compositions developed and became more sophisticated, often conveying epic traditions. In examining ve different sets of pediments, all cre- ated during the sixth century BCE, we will see the stylistic and compositional changes that distinguish the manner in which the individual narratives of the Greek epic tradition are told. The Temple of Artemis at Corcyra The Archaic Doric pseudo-dipteral temple of Artemis dates to around 600-580 BCE and is built on the island of Corcyra off the northwest coast of the mainland. Only one of the pediments (the one on the west side) is in a fair state of preservation, while the other (on the east side) is so badly damaged that it is hard to be certain of the subject. However, enough of the east pediment survives to indicate that the same forms were probably repeated on both sides. 1 The pediments measure 3.15 meters high and about 22 meters long. In the west pediment we see the transition from the earlier use of the space as a mere architectural decoration to its later use as a showcase for the epic narrative and for direct representa-tions of the deity and its domain (Fig. 1). The west pediment sculpture is in a fair state of preservation, enough to see the central gures, one whole lion, and bits of the scenes off to the sides in the corners. The sculpture stands in high relief and had been carved on separate slabs of rock and then placed into Explorations: An Undergraduate Research Journal 200366Stefanie Ann Norris the triangular space of the background. High relief was used because as of the time this temple was built, it was impossible for the sculptors to create freestanding compositions, and low relief works would not have been visible from the ground level. 2 In the center of the west pediment is the running gure of the Gorgon Medusa shown with her serpentine hair and clothed in a short chiton with a snake belt. On either side are the disproportionately smaller gures of Pegasus and Chrysaor, her children, who were born to her posthumously . Next, Medusa's children are fl anked by feline gures crouching to match the descent of the triangle (Fig 2). T wo small narrative scenes ll in the space near the cor- ner, while in the very corners are reclining g- ures. In the right hand corner is a small scene of Zeus attacking a giant, probably referring back to the myth of the battle between the gods and the giants, known as the Gigantomachy . We gain a much better understanding of the Gigantomachy from Hesiod's Theogony , the Greek creation story that explains how the world came to be as it is. One of its main themes is how the gods defeated anarchy and restored order to the world. The left scene on the pedi-ment illustrates Priam dying at the hand of Neoptoleos, the son of Achilles, an event that took place during the sacking of Troy . The two scenes at the edges, which are completely out of proportion and smaller when compared with the central Gorgon and lion gures, seem to have nothing to do with the other parts of the pediment. On the surface, it is not apparent exactly what all these elements have to do with the goddess Artemis, the deity of hunting, wild animals, nature, the harvest, and childbirth. The Gorgon gure was sometimes used in Greek art as an alternate for a Near-Eastern type of \"Mistress of Animals.\" When we think of Medusa, we typically recall the story of Perseus cutting off her head, but the only aspect of that story of importance here is the fact that her full-grown children sprung from her neck once he decapi-tated her. The running gure of the Gorgon implies violent movement and emphasizes the wilder and more ferocious side of her nature. 4 Since Artemis was the goddess of animals and nature, it is logical to depict such a creature and its offspring alongside lions on her temple. The overall narrative makes little sense, however, as both Pegasus and Chrysaor were born after Perseus cut Medusa's head off. The narrative is also confusing because the gures of her progeny are more than half her size. This is not to indicate that they are young, for the image of Chrysaor appears full-grown. However, this discrepancy would not have been unusual to the Greeks; many vase paintings likewise depict gures that are supposed to be full grown but who are far smaller than the rest of the char-Figure 2.

(Plate courtesy of Yale University Press3)Explorations: An Undergraduate Research Journal 200367Development of the Triangular Pediment Space in Archaic Greek Temples acters in the composition.5 Ridgway suggests that the presentation of the Medusa's two children is used solely for identi cation of the Gorgon, which would make sense given what remains of the pediment.6 The two scenes at the corners of the triangle, however, do not t into the narrative that we see in the central part of the space. It could be that the lions are used as a way to visually separate the three scenes or narratives, or it could be that the three narratives convey a common theme, such as the idea that the goddess is supreme and able to conquer enemies and protect her followers. By using powerful gures such as monsters, ferocious animals, and images of the destruction of the Greeks' enemies, the sculptor effectively conveys the power of Artemis and emphasizes the fact that she is worthy of worship. The gures of monsters and powerful animals on the temple would also have terri ed the ancient Greeks. Their depiction was a new development, and would certainly have made many respect the temple as holy ground. It is interesting that the Corcyrans would have chosen Medusa and her progeny to be at the center of their temple, as the symbol for Corinth was Pegasus. 7 Since Corcyra was a colony of Corinth, one of the wealthiest cities at this time, its citizens would have wanted to strengthen their ties to their mother city . Surely they were sensitive to the fact that their temple had political overtones in favor of an asso-ciation with Corinth. Pediments were probably rst conceived and built in Corinth, which was also ap- parently the place that the use of the Gorgon mask on temple structures was perfected. 8 The artist here intentionally made Medusa's and Chrysaor's faces mask-like, in the style of faces from an earlier period, and thereby separates their gures from the later forms at the corners of the pediment. 9 Overall, there is a great sense of movement in the gures on this pediment, with the running shape of Medusa, the lunging form of Zeus, and Neoptolemos slaying Priam. Yet even with all the movement we see in the pediment space, it is very dif cult to say whether or not a single coherent narrative was intended. The gures are of varying proportions and sizes, making the relationships among them un- clear. The space seems to be divided to form three separate narratives rather than a single organized storyline. 10 Possibly , the collection of images is not intended to be read as a narrative, but rather to convey a theme, or perhaps this kind of presentation is simply a precursor to the depiction of complete narratives. In both corners of the west pediment, we see the gures depicting the theme of order defeat- ing chaos, or of the Greeks defeating a foreign power that threatens their well-being. The idea of Greeks defeating others becomes a very common theme in later works of architectural sculpture, and individual depictions of the same events portrayed in Artemis's temple are used later on other temples to produce coherent narratives. The Old Temple of Athena at Athens There is a great deal of controversy as to whether or not the Old Temple of Athena is the same building as the Hekatompedon. Based on an inscription identifying the temples as two separate build-ings, some scholars argue that Hekatompedon (literally , \"Hundred Footer\" in Greek) is the name of an older temple that no longer stood when the Old Temple of Athena was built, while others suggest that \"Hundred Footer\" was a nickname for Athena's temple. 11 However, the similarities in the narrative and style of the surviving sculptures from the pediments suggest that the two are most likely the same, and I will treat them as such for this examination. The temple has been dated to 529-520 BCE and stood in the area of the present Erechtheion. 12 The Old Temple of Athena was rendered in the Doric order and the pediments were made from limestone. These pediments are in a very poor state of preservation, adding to the confusion over whether or not the Hekatompedon and the Old Temple of Athena are one and the same. The pediments here measure around 2.5 meters high and are 21 meters long, close in size to those in the Temple of Artemis at Corcyra.Explorations: An Undergraduate Research Journal 200368Stefanie Ann Norris In the center stand two monumental lions, which hover over a fallen bull that they are devouring. The two small scenes in the corners show Herakles ghting a monster (Fig. 3). On the right he battles a three-bod-ied monster (referred to as \"Bluebeard\"), which coils away , and on the left he ghts Triton, the son of Poseidon. 13 The charac- ter of Bluebeard is most likely the mon-ster T yphon, a son of Earth and Tartarus. It is said that he was the largest and most fearsome creature that walked the earth, with a hundred serpent heads growing from his shoulders, snakes for feet, and eyes and head capable of fl ashing re. 14 It has been postulated that the scene depicts one part of the battle between the gods and the giants. 15 The scene of Herakles battling Triton is less well known to us to-day because it did not become part of the canon that we now call the T welve Labors of Herakles; however, that does not nec-essarily mean that it was less important in the Greek epic tradition. The themes of order defeating chaos and of the gods using their power to protect the people shine through in these pediments. The characters and style of presentation in the pediment sculpture in the Old Temple of Athena are very reminiscent of those in the earlier Temple of Artemis at Corcyra. Much like the scene depicted in the Corcyra Temple, which featured a running Gorgon Medusa, fl anked by two gures (her children) who are in turn fl anked by lions, on the west pediment of the Old Temple of Athena we see a winged Gorgon gure fl anked by a feline on either side and two tiny scenes in the corners with large snakes ll- ing in the very edges. The gures and layout on the east pediment are similar, minus the Medusa gure. The Gorgon has apotropaic qualities, with her wide-eyed mask-like face and tongue sticking out, as if she guards the temple. The two lions face the Gorgon, with the lioness covering a small bull, while her companion lion has no prey under him. The two corners, respectively , present scenes of the introduction of Herakles into Olympia and of the Birth of Athena. 16 In the scene involving Herakles, we see him being brought among the gods to take his place with them after many years of suffering and attempting to atone for his sins. The fact that Athena had been his patron and guided him in his battles explains his pres-ence on her temple. In the scene of the birth of Athena, she springs from the head of Zeus as Hephaestus cuts his head open with an axe. There is a great deal of movement present in these pediments, with the Gorgon in the same running position as we found at Corcyra, lions savagely devouring prey , and scenes with humans engaged in battles. Like those on the Corcyra pediments, the gures on the Old Temple of Athena are also rendered out of proportion and do not display a clear, easily-read narrative. The disproportion among the gures suggests that there are distinct narratives sharing the same triangular space. The scenes show stylistic qualities and apotropaic themes similar to those found in the Old Temple, but lack the unity in theme that characterizes later archaic temple pediments. Figure 3. Reconstruction of pediments from the Old Temple of Athena at Athens. (Plate courtesy of Yale University Press)Explorations: An Undergraduate Research Journal 200369Development of the Triangular Pediment Space in Archaic Greek Temples The Treasury of the Siphnians at Delphi The Siphnian Treasury at Delphi dates to between 530-525 BCE and is rendered in the Ionic style of white Cycladic marble from Siphnos.17 The legend attached to the treasury tells how the Siphnians came to build it. The island of Siphnos contained productive gold and silver mines, and Apollo commanded the inhabitants of the island to pay tithes on the mines to Delphi. After the islanders built the treasury , they became greedy and refused to pay the tithes. Because of this blasphemy , the sea overfl owed and de- stroyed the mines and the settlements. In his Histories Herodotus mentions the mines and the building of the treasury , but notes that the destruction of Siphnos came when the Samians sacked the island in 525 BCE. 18 Excavations show that pits for smelting gold are now at the bottom of the sea, evidence that the water has risen considerably since then, as the tradition suggests. The pediments measure approximately 0.75 meters high and 3.83 meters long, making for a smaller scene than is present in either the Temple of Artemis or Athena's Old Temple. It is interesting to note that on the lower portion of the pediment, the gures depicted have been executed in high relief, while those in the upper parts have been rendered completely in the round, making this the only known example of such a transition. 19 Nothing of the west pediment remains and there is no known documentation of what scene had decorated that space. Enough of the east pediment survives to identify that it depicts the dispute between Herakles and Apollo over the Delphic tripod (Fig. 4). The myth tells us that, after the murders of many of his friends and family , Herakles sought out the advice of the Delphic Oracle. When it could not give an answer that comforted him, he tore the temple apart, and when he saw the Tripod, he decided to establish an oracle of his own. 20 It was then that Apollo intervened to prevent his prized possession from being taken from his sacred site. In the east pediment we see for the rst time an example of multiple scenes uni ed by a single nar- rative, a characteristic that becomes standard in later temple pediments. Although the outcome of the story is not depicted explicitly and the scene leaves off at the point at which Herakles carries the tripod off, viewers would have known that Apollo will get his tripod back, not only because the myth tells them so but also because, in the scene, Zeus gives Apollo a look that acknowledges that the tripod is his and will stay with him. In the center of the pediment stand Herakles and Apollo with Zeus between them, preventing his sons from further ghting. To the left stands Artemis, who tries to hold back her brother by the arms as he tries to seize the tripod. To the right, Athena looks on as Herakles escapes with the tripod on his back, while he gazes over his shoulder at Athena and Apollo. In the corners are the re-mains of human gures and horses, which probably appeared along with chariots that had been painted on, since there was not enough space on the pediment to sculpt both gures and chariots. 21 In this pediment the characters are closer to being in proportion to each other, and the multiple scenes that take place within the same space and time are uni ed around a single narrative. That Zeus is looking over at Apollo alludes to the fact that his son will reclaim the Tripod, and reinforces Apollo's authority over the sacred site. This is the rst known example of a pediment scene linking epic tradition simultaneously to the signi cance of both the deity and the speci c site of his or her temple.Figure 4. East pediment of the Siphnian Treasury at Delphi. (Plate courtesy of Yale University Press) Explorations: An Undergraduate Research Journal 200370Stefanie Ann Norris The Temple of Apollo at Delphi The pediments on the Doric temple of Apollo, which dates to 510 BCE and is made of limestone and marble, are in a very poor state of preservation (Fig. 5).22 We are fortunate to have as much of these pedi- ments remaining as we do, because, after the temple's destruction in 373 BCE, they lay buried behind a retain-ing wall to the north. 23 The pediments measure approximately 2.3 meters high and 19.5 meters long, making them only slightly smaller than those on the earlier archaic temples with Gorgon relief sculpture. However, in comparison with earlier temples-the Old Temple of Athena and the Temple of Artemis at Corcyra-we see dramat-ic changes in the placement and size of the gures within the triangular space as well as in the overall appear-ance of the pediments. According to ancient tradition, Delphi was conse-crated to Ge, or Gaia (Mother Earth), who shared the original temple space with her son Python, a giant dragon who held control over the Oracle at Delphi. Apollo had to defeat Python, the heavenly ruler, as well as Delphos, the earthly king of Delphi, in order to proclaim himself the new ruler. 24 The east pediment, which stands over the temple's entrance and is there-fore more important, depicts Apollo's triumphant entry into Delphi. In the scene, Apollo rides on a chariot facing outward toward those entering the temple. He is fl anked on the left by Phoebe (Goddess of Light), Themis (Goddess of Justice) and Ge (Mother Earth), and on the right by King Delphos and two Athenians (Fig. 6, upper). At the edges of the triangle are individual lions attacking a stag and a bull, respectively , with a lot of empty space at the corners. We can identify these characters because of the description that Aeschylus provides in the rst six lines of his play Eumenides , when the Prophetess proclaims: With rst place among the gods in this prayer I give special honour to Earth, the rst prophet; and after her, to Themis, for she was the second to sit at her mother's oraclehere, as one story has it. The third to have this of ce assigned-it was at Themis' wish and with no violence toanyone-was another of Earth's daughters by Titan, Phoebe. 25Figure 6. Reconstruction of the east (upper) and west (lower) pediments from the Temple of Apollo at Delphi. (Plate courtesy of Yale University Press) Figure 5. Present state of the east pediment of the Temple of Apollo at Delphi. (Plate courtesy of Yale University Press) Explorations: An Undergraduate Research Journal 200371Development of the Triangular Pediment Space in Archaic Greek Temples Though written about fty years after the temple was built, Aeschylus' play helps us to understand what is depicted in the triangular space. The gures of Ge and King Delphos help to legitimize Apollo's assumption of Python's place as the keeper of the Oracle and heavenly ruler of Delphi. The gures of Phoebe and Themis, who are welcoming Apollo and represent light and justice, respectively , help add to the idea that the god is the embodiment of virtue, nobility , justice, goodness, and courage. Delphi was a sanctuary of such great importance that people traveled from all across Greece, not only because it housed the Oracle but also because it provided a place for the exchange of information and ideas. 26 Eumenides is centrally involved with the theme of justice, and features a plot in which, at the order of Apollo, Orestes kills his mother Klytemnestra and her lover for having murdered his father. In killing her, Orestes avenges his father's death as well as atoning for the ultimate sin that she committed in destroying the family; he is thus responsible for ending a cycle of death and self-destruction that had plagued his family for generation. 27 Through his character, this play asserts that Apollo represents light, justice and the superior strength of order over disorder and chaos. The pediment pieces as well as the play would have been devices used to teach the Greeks and their children about proper behavior and morals. These epic stories were portrayed on the temples to refl ect the moral principles that the Greeks felt were re- quired to live a good life. In light of Greek philosophy and ethics, we can also see the pediment scene as a comment on the distinctive qualities of Apollo. The Greeks considered him to have been the most gifted of all gods in his generosity , understanding, and insight, the one who saw to it that men followed the light of reason and integrity . 28 People from all around the known world came to consult Apollo's oracle and took its advice to heart. The west pediment portrays a different theme. It depicts a different version of the battle between the gods and the giants (the Gigantomachy) than that portrayed on the earlier Corcyra temple (Fig. 6, lower). In the center of the pediment Zeus and Hera ride forward in a chariot. To the left of them stand Apollo, Artemis and Athena attacking three giants, while on the right are Poseidon and Dionysus pushing three giants toward a hungry lion .29 The placement of the characters in the scene makes it clear that the gods are forcing the giants into the corners of the pediment, and the giants are thus cast in a more passive role in the scene. It has been suggested that the snake and the lion on the pediment corners allude to the Old Temple of Athena and perhaps even to the Temple of Artemis at Corcyra as well. 30 The theme of the gods defeating the giants was of great importance to the Greeks. It was intended to be uplifting, repre-senting the victory-both moral and political-of Order over Chaos, as the giants who tried to overthrow the gods were defeated. It also reinforced the theme at Delphi of the superiority of Apollo's honor, justice, and reason. As Delphi was his place of worship, the Greeks honored him there by celebrating his power and ability to protect his home and his followers, thus strengthening their sense of national identity and glorifying Greek culture. Both pediments of Apollo's temple at Delphi give a clearer sense of narrative than is present in the older temples we have examined. All of the gures are nearly the same size and are in proportion, and we see clearer relationships among the gures and scenes, in contrast to the separate scenes that we saw in earlier temples. Even the animal gures are in proportion, or nearly so, to the human gures. The west pediment in particular makes use of dynamic moving forms to ll the space, with gures crouch- ing, dying, spearing and shooting. The sculptures overall appear more sophisticated in the way that they are rendered-much more life-like than the gures in the earlier temples. Finally , the fact that the statues are carved completely in the round shows that these later artists had a better understanding of how free-standing statues could be placed onto pediment spaces in a way that minimized the risk of their falling off and breaking. Explorations: An Undergraduate Research Journal 200372Stefanie Ann Norris The Temple of Aphaia at Aegina Aphaia's temple at Aegina, which dates to approximately 500-480 BCE, is made of limestone and is done in the Doric order. Originally , the island of Aegina was called Oenone and remained uninhabited until Zeus led the nymph Aegina there and she bore him a son, Aeacus, who would later ask his father to name the island in honor of his mother. Zeus then transformed the ants on the island into men to inhabit the land. 31 Aeacus was the grandfather to many of the greatest Greek heroes of the Trojan War, includ- ing Achilles, Ajax, and Teucer, and so it is not surprising that the temple is decorated with scenes from that confl ict. While Aegina and the myths of the island do not have a pan-Hellenic meaning, they clearly refl ect the honor and pride of the Aegintans in their heroic ancestry . The pediments are made of marble and are in an excellent state of preservation. They measure 1.72 meters tall and 15 meters long, making them just about life sized-only slight-ly smaller than Apollo's pediments and much larger than the Siphnian Treasury pediment. Like those on the previous temples, the pedi-ments in the Temple of Aphaia would have had lots of colors painted onto the gures, pri- marily cream, red and black. Spaces between the gures that allowed light to pass through them would have sharpened and enhanced their appearance. 32 The pediments are done completely in the round. Both depict scenes from the sack of Troy with the goddess Athena in the very center of the space. The east pediment shows the sack of Troy by Telamon and Herakles, while the west shows the battle fought by the Greeks under Agamemnon (Fig. 7). 33 In each, many of the gures are almost completely preserved, giving us a good indication of their placement in the pediment space and an even better understanding of the action in the scene. Similar to many of the earlier pediments, there is a great deal of movement in these temple pedi- ments. Both show dynamic battles between the Trojans and the Greeks. The central gure of Athena looks out to the viewer, while none of the other gures look up, as they are all too engaged in battle to look away from their tasks. This small fact sets her physically outside the battle, and makes her appear even more divine. Because according to their myths she supports the Greek cause, her spiritual presence forecasts their victory over the Trojans. We see Herakles clearly on the east pediment, wearing his lion skin and drawing his bow as he pre- pares to shoot the enemy . On the west pediment, we see Ajax to the right of Athena, engaged in an intense battle with the Trojans. Many of the gures are depicted nude, except for the gures of the archers and Athena. All of the characters are in proportion to one another, and appear life-like. The sculptors lled the triangular space completely with crouching archers, lunging warriors, and dying men. The gures of dying men t into the corners of the pediment perfectly , leaving very little space un lled. Unlike that in earlier temples, the space in both pediments depicts a clear narrative that unmistakably tells a story through a scene from Greek epic tradition. Both scenes show the same battle, only a generation apart and with different characters, thus unifying the overall theme of the temple. The presence of Athena not only celebrates her part in the war, but also closely links her power and protection with two important local deities: Aegina and Aphaia. Aegina is the ancestor of the characters Figure 7. Present state of the west pediment from the Temple of Aphaia at Aegina. (Plate courtesy of Yale University Press) Explorations: An Undergraduate Research Journal 200373Development of the Triangular Pediment Space in Archaic Greek Temples in Homer's Iliad and gave her name to the island on which the Temple of Aphaia is located. Although not very important beyond Crete and the surrounding islands, including the island of Aegina, Aphaia was another nymph and a daughter of Zeus. When Minos fell in love with her, she decided that to prevent her capture she would jump into the sea, and ended up landing in the nets of shermen. One of the shermen fell in love with her, took her to the island of Aegina, and subsequently tried to rape her. With Athena's help and protection, however, she was able to escape into the forest. To honor Aphaia for going to such great lengths to protect her chastity , Athena made her into a goddess. 34 Because both pediments depict Athena protecting the Greeks during the battle, early scholars thought that this temple had been dedicated to her. However, it now seems more likely that Athena's presence on Aphaia's temple merely makes the scene more recognizable and reinforces Aphaia's local reputation as a chaste goddess. 35 While the link that binds the goddess Aphaia, the island of Aegina, and the sacking of Troy is not immediately evident, an understanding of Greek mythology makes it clear. The temple is located in a site that was the center of the island's cultural and religious life, with other important buildings surrounding it. Aegina had a strong oligarchy by the time Aphaia's shrine was constructed. Built to commemorate the extraordinary part that the Aegintans had played in the Battle of Salamis, in which thirty ships manned with hundreds of men fought with distinguished skill and bravery , Aphaia's temple overlooks the sea from both sides. 36 The temple shows the pride that the Aegintans had in their heritage and in their ancestors, who were some of the great heroes of the Trojan War and who had descended from the namesake of their island, and honors the goddess who escaped losing her chastity by fl eeing to their island. These pediments show the end result in the long process of creating a concise narrative that lled the triangular space completely . In tying the myths of the island's foundation with the nymph Aphaia, the Aegintans were able to create a more concise narrative that refl ected their pride in their heritage and epic tradition. In all of these temple pediments we see the devotion of the Greeks to their gods. The earlier temples of Artemis and Athena show multiple narratives on their pediments and use Gorgons to convey a sense of power and to ward off evil. In the earliest temples, the pediment sculpture was done completely in relief, until Greek sculptors became technically advanced enough to put the sculpture up on the high space without worrying that it would fall and break. These early pediment sculptors were also not concerned with making the gures proportional to each other, and different scenes with different-sized gures were used to ll in the triangular space. The Treasury of the Siphnians represents a transition between the ear- lier pediments, in which the gures were depicted in relief, and the later pediments, in which the gures were sculpted in the round. The Treasury pediment is also the rst example of a depiction of only one scene with all gures in proportion to one another, with narrative devices being used to allude to earlier and later moments in the narrative. This marks the beginnings of a style in which uni ed compositions are created by telling an entire story from only one scene. The pediments of the later temples dedicated to Apollo and Aphaia show the culmination of this development, with gures lling the space completely , a style that became the standard for the decoration of later temple pediments. Each pediment shows us a step in the progress toward a more aesthetically pleasing and coherent narrative on the temple structure, and each also displays the pride that the Greeks had in their epic heritage. In the heroic tales pictured on these pediments, they conveyed their morals and ethics, their pan-Hellenic and local traditions, and most importantly , their identities as Greeks. With the solidifying of the standard for how Greek temples were to be styled came also the solidarity of the people in their place of worship.Explorations: An Undergraduate Research Journal 200374 Notes 1.

This also appears to be a common occurrence in Greek vase painting at the time.

The fact that the two pediments were constructed of different materials-the east is limestone, while the west is marble-is due to the convergence of two events, one natural and one political, that occurred during the temple's construction and rebuilding. The east pediments had already been constructed and survived a re that destroyed much of the rest of the temple in 548 BCE. By the time the west pediments were constructed, the building was being supported by a new set of patrons, the Alcmaeonidae, who, after having been driven from Athens by the ruler, Pisistratus, were attempting to reclaim their position in Athenian society by rebuilding Apollo's temple and thus enlisting that god's help. Not surprisingly , only a short time after the re, the Oracle at Delphi announced that the Alcmaeonidae should be allowed back into society (Holmberg, 23-24). 22. 24. translated by Christopher Collard (Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 2002), 85. 26.

The girls that are wanted are home girls, Girls that are Mother's right hand;That Fathers and Mothers can trust to,And the little ones understand. Girls that are fair on the hearth stone, And fair when nobody sees;Kind and sweet to their own folks,Ready and anxious to please.... The clever, the witty , the brilliant girl, They are very few understand;But O, for the wise loving home girls,There's a constant and steady demand. 1 Background: Confl icting Ideals When the Girls' Department of the Whittier State School of California opened its grounds in 1891, legislators, administrators, instructors and reformers were hoping to create an environment that would transform the immoral wayward girl into a useful and desirable young lady . The founders of Whittier envisioned a reform agenda that would \"turn out upon the community...women able and will-Explorations: An Undergraduate Research Journal 200378Jaclynn Davis ing to make an honest living, and with character and ability to ll [that] very station in life.\"2 Rebellious girls would enter Whittier as wild teens, and years later would leave as reformed ladies. The desire was motivated by a new ideology of reform that began in the last quarter of the nine- teenth century , a Progressive ideology that supplanted the philosophy and traditions of Victorian reform. Victorian efforts at reform had involved a crusade for moral purity that cast the fallen woman as the help-less prey of male lust, and thus as a victim in need of being saved and civilized. Acting on assumptions of moral, intellectual, religious, and racial superiority , middle-class Christian women had established missionary homes to reform and reclaim the girls and women whose purity had been tainted. Because \"culture and civilization were assumed to be the sole property of white middle-class Americans,\" mis-sionary workers sought to re-shape their wards in the likeness of themselves. 3 By 1890, however, the \"civilizing mission\" had faded and been replaced by the Progressive reform ideology that gave birth to Whittier State School. Rather than viewing women as passionless victims of male aggression, Progressive reformers began to acknowledge female sexuality and self-determination. Instead of blaming men, the new generation of reformers saw delinquency as a product of family envi-ronment, with poverty , illiteracy , a lack of structure and authority , and an absence of Christian values in the working-class home all creating the conditions that allowed for and even encouraged delinquent behavior. 4 One reformer expressed her belief that \"the majority of our juvenile delinquents...have been more sinned against than sinning.\"5 The face of reformers changed as well. Educated middle-class social workers replaced pious Christian ladies, and reformatories replaced mission homes . Progressives turned away from the private religious organizations that had sheltered wayward girls, and now demanded that the State take responsibility for its rebellious daughters. 6 Reform schools such as Whittier were the result. Despite the emerging reform ideology in the larger society and despite its founders' intentions, however, Whittier\u2014in both curricu-lum and practice-was infl uenced heavily by the older moral purity crusades rooted in Christianity and Victorian ideology . Within the walls of Whittier the civilizing mission continued alongside the Progressive agenda, creating an uneasy and, for the most part, unacknowledged tension between confl icting ideals. Everyone involved with Whittier hoped that the school would become \"a monumental declaration of an advanced civilization involving a home for the homeless, an asylum for the unfortunate, a refuge for the uncared-for and unkempt; a school for the physical as well as intellectual and moral culture.\" 7 Because Progressive reform efforts targeted the victims of industrialization-the poor, the homeless, the downtrodden worker-Whittier would transform these \"unfortunate children of depravity\" into produc-tive and law-abiding members of society , and they would do so through love and compassion. 8 At Whittier, the scrutiny of family environment led to professed attempts to create a nurturing home at the school. Reverend Dr. Thomas Stalker declared that \"the State must work according to the nature and laws of governing children or it cannot save them. The nearer the reform school approximates the character and conditions of the Christian family , the more ef cient it will become.\" 9 This quotation highlights one of the central tensions within life at Whittier: while reformers hoped to create a loving environment, a family , and a Christian home, they also hoped to create an ef cient institution, complete with hard work, strict schedules, bells and regulations. Other incompatibilities ensued from the contradictory impulses and ideals of the older and the emerging reform movements. Progressive institutions of reform hoped to simultaneously shape ideal mothers and ef cient breadwinners. The importance of women to the next generations and the role the reformatory would play in the redemption of future mothers were ideas established within the very rst reform school for girls in North America. In 1857, the Lancaster School for Girls was established with the intent of saving wayward girls and with the philosophy that \"it is sublime work to save a w oman, for in her bosom generations are embodied, and in her hands, if perverted, the fate of innumerable men Explorations: An Undergraduate Research Journal 200379Teaching the Bad Girls: The \"Servant Problem\" and California's Reform School, 1890-1915 is held.\"10 This view held through the end of the century , and was one of the ideals on which Whittier was founded. So while the reform school intended to shape dutiful mothers and wholesome families, it also em- phasized the preparation of girls for work. These were, after all, working-class girls who would have to support themselves and also their families. Whittier recognized this reality , and so developed a curricu- lum that prepared the girls to succeed in a trade, teaching sewing, cooking, cleaning and other domestic tasks. At a Thanksgiving dinner in the Girls' Department, guest speaker Reverend Florence Kollock noted that \"the chief advantage that you have here is this, that you are being taught how to do something.... Many times I have said to fathers and mothers,...do something which is in nitely better, give them a trade, teach them to do something, teach them to be independent.\" 11 According to the rhetoric of reform, however, being both a working mother (a primary goal of Progressive ideology) and an ideal parent (a primary goal of Victorian ideology , yet one adopted by Progressives) was an incompatible combination. For while reformers sought to turn wayward girls into productive members of society , they felt that women could not work and simultaneously live up to the ideals of motherhood. As one reformer stated, it was the \"hard labor\" of that \"class of honest and hard-working parents\" that both \"support[ed] the little ones, [and made] it impossible for [parents] to give the time necessary for their proper bringing up.\" 12 And yet, despite the contradiction, the girls at Whittier, as we shall see, were inculcated in both ideals through school curriculum and routine, and therefore were caught between the confl icting ideals. Just as reformers and their institutions were shifting phases, the rebellious girls whom reformers tar- geted were also changing and presenting new problems. Whittier opened in the midst of a striking transi-tion in female gender and sexual ideology , and the Whittier girls, by the very nature of their crimes, were pioneers of this new culture of social and sexual freedom that the reformatory sought to regulate. While records of the Whittier girls' speci c crimes remain under restricted access, the school's public records reveal that the majority of girls were committed for sexual delinquency , a \"crime\" which, according to available historical records, was overwhelmingly the most common justi cation for committing girls to reformatories at the turn of the century . 13 Reformers spoke frequently of \"the stigma of immorality\" that marked the girls, and Whittier Superintendent Fred C. Nelles spoke of hopes to reform \"the girl who has drunk so deep of the cup of shame.\" 14 Committed to reformatories by the courts for transgressions of proper feminine behavior, these girls had offended law enforcement, families, and reformers by engaging in sexual behavior, refusing to obey parental authority , and participating in a youth culture that took them out of the home and placed them in environments such as dance halls and amusement parks. Although they were rst drawn into the public workplace by the necessity of contributing to a family economy , these girls, many of them from immigrant families, participated in a movement that revolutionized gender roles and sexuality for working-class females. They transgressed gendered norms by staying out late, drinking, smoking, fl irt- ing, and engaging in sexual relations with various men. Caught by law enforcement of cials or turned over to the courts by frustrated parents who had lost control, these were the girls gone wrong, the bad girls of Whittier, and they , along with other young working-class women, were creating a culture all their own. 15 Reformers increasingly worried about this \"Girl Problem,\" which threatened the stability of domi- nant white middle-class ideology , and they mobilized a campaign of moral purity to save adolescent females from sexual exploitation, and to save their own middle-class daughters from corruption. Whittier emerged out of the attempt to solve this \"Girl Problem.\" 16 So while Whittier was established as a Progressive reform institution to bene t the girls, it also served to meet middle-class needs and to quiet middle-class fears. Explorations: An Undergraduate Research Journal 200380Jaclynn Davis The proper role and image for women were dif cult to de ne in the midst of the transition from a Victorian ideology that prized piety , purity , and morality , to the philosophy of a new womanhood that valued education, independence, sexual autonomy , and participation in a public economic, social, and political sphere. The girls who entered Whittier were caught between confl icting images of what they should be, and the school was confused about what it should teach. Whittier thus embodied the problems and contradictions faced by an institution bent on reform. What exactly was a reformed girl? Who determined the standards by which reformation could be deemed successful? To what \"station in life\" was it appropriate that the girls aspire? A portrait of life at Whittier reveals an institutional experience with strict regulations, tight schedules, and hard work. Yet a day at the school also involved evening prayer and hymns, elegant dining facilities, and lectures on the meaning of womanhood. T wo different pictures of Whittier emerge, and tensions between the school as a home and the school as an institution repeatedly converge to refl ect contradictory visions of a reformed girl. So what exactly did reformers hope to achieve at Whittier, and what messages about working-class woman-hood were they delivering to the girls? With a curriculum like that of most other reform schools in the United States at the time, Whittier State School sought to reform girls not only by channeling the girls' sexual drive into appropriate forms, not only by molding them into dutiful and loving mothers, but also by training them for work-and more speci cally for domestic service. It is here that the \"Girl Problem\" converges with another prevalent issue of the era, the \"Servant Problem.\" At the turn of the century , the occupation of domestic service carried vast social implications and stigmas. The topic of hostile relations between middle-class employers and their workers, \"The Servant Problem,\" occupied countless magazine articles and various reform agendas. And yet for twenty- ve years, Whittier trained its girls to ful ll perfectly the station of a servant, the ob- ject of such debate and condescension in this era. The girls of Whittier were thus bombarded with confl icting signals, and were confronted with sev- eral implicit questions: Was Whittier a home or an institution? Were they a part of a family , or were they inmates and workers? Reformers taught that, on one hand, the girls' fall from grace resulted directly from a lack of family structure, parental authority , and support and nurture. Working-class parents were too heavily burdened with other concerns to devote adequate time to raising respectful and dutiful children. So the reform school would replace the family and provide the home environment necessary to cultivate these young women and to ensure that they would one day be the type of mother that reformers desired. Whittier would therefore be a Christian home, a nurturing family . On the other hand, Whittier emphasized the importance of independence and economic autonomy for the girls, knowing what challenges faced them outside the reformatory walls. Long work hours, strict schedules, rules and regulations would prepare the girls to be ef cient workers. A primary aim, therefore, must be to train the girls as industrial workers. To this end, the curriculum at Whittier included classes in which the girls learned the skills necessary for various trades and then used those skills to provide services to the school. Girls stationed at the laundry washed the school's clothes, girls in the kitchen cooked and served the meals, and girls in the sewing room assembled new dresses and mended tears and loose buttons. To their critics, reformers at Whittier responded: \"Some good people might think [the girls] should be taught music and the ne arts, but the majority of these girls will have to earn their own living when they leave the school, and if they are to turn out respectable women and credible members of society , they must learn at school that which will serve them to be useful, and will serve them as breadwinner, not as an accomplishment.\" 17 The underlying philosophy was \"that moral elevation and industry will be acquired only by educating the youth to a point where they will have the desire to cheerfully perform Explorations: An Undergraduate Research Journal 200381Teaching the Bad Girls: The \"Servant Problem\" and California's Reform School, 1890-1915 some work in life.\"18 This emphasis suggests that Whittier valued preparation for work above correction of delinquency , or rather, that work was the primary means of correction. In this way , the institutional aspects of Whittier dominate over the image of the reformatory as a loving Christian family . Concurrent with the intensive training and with the inculcation of the value of being an indepen- dent and autonomous worker, however, came a host of messages that complicated this idea of woman-hood. Although Whittier prepared the girls for working-class trades, the lectures and classes were simul-taneously emphasizing the possibility of alternative futures. An article published in The Whittier , entitled \"Women as Doctors,\" for instance, touted the vast professional opportunities that awaited the girls upon their release, encouraging their dreams of social and economic mobility: \"[N]owhere in the world is there a place where the modern woman has had and has such enthusiastic support in all her ventures as here in America, and the modern woman has not been slow in improving opportunities offered her. It is hard to mention any eld into which she has not entered to compete successfully with the sterner sex.\" 19 While women in society indeed had greater access to the professions, working-class girls were largely excluded, practically if not theoretically , from these opportunities. Likewise, while some reformers suggested that learning middle-class re nements such as music would serve no purpose for the working girl, the cur- riculum at Whittier still called for music courses that young middle-class ladies would have enjoyed. The school thus seemingly encouraged middle-class ambitions while preparing the girls for the realities of a working-class life. To add to the confusion, Victorian ideals of gender, religion, and class pervaded the school. The girls not only received the mixed messages about their role as working girl and as aspiring middle-class house-wife, but also were indoctrinated with the ideals of Victorian womanhood. Surrounded by \"gentler home infl uences,\" the girls listened to talks that instructed them in the ner traits of purity and piety , directed them to be helpful and dutiful, and exhorted them as women to be \"gentle,...kind in [their] treatment of other women,...unsel sh and self-denying.\" 20 By remaining gentle, harmonious, and pious, the girls could prove themselves \"good wom[e]n, and a pride to [their] kind.\"21 A poem published in The Whittier , entitled \"The Girls that are Wanted,\" instructed them further in what was desirable in a young lady . Good girls are \"Pure as the lily is pure and white...kind and sweet...ready and anxious to please.\" Good girls are \"home girls,\" \"careful girls,\" girls that \"are wanted for mothers and wives.\" At the same time, they are \"the frailest of lives.\" Here, the autonomous and inde-pendent girl working in the public sphere is replaced entirely by the subdued, dependent, domestic girl. As a nal blow to the image of the modern woman, the poem concludes by dismissing \"the clever, the witty , the brilliant girl\" and praising \"the wise loving home girls\" for whom \"there's a constant and steady demand.\" 22 The message? A girl who can attain the image of Victorian womanhood is more desirable than the new woman who values independence, education, athleticism and economic autonomy .23 The images of womanhood at Whittier confl ated different ideals. The girls received one message that validated their position as working-class girls and urged them to embrace their station cheerily , another that promised access to social and economic upward mobility , and yet another that suggested that the ultimate virtue lay in adopting Victorian gender roles and ideology . In the mass of contradictions at the heart of the Whittier education lay a paradoxical curriculum of working-class ef ciency and middle-class sophistication that ultimately prepared the girls to meet the standards of a good servant, one of the most class-conscious and stigmatized lines of work available to working girls. Thus, while the school acted with benevolent intentions, seeking to engage wayward girls in productive work, its educational program in practice denied social mobility to the very girls it sought to help. A deeper look into the nature of \"The Servant Problem\" helps to frame an examination of the ways in which Whittier's program enacted the contradictions outlined in this section. In the following sec-Explorations: An Undergraduate Research Journal 200382Jaclynn Davis tions, we will see that, as Whittier's training of the girls sought to solve the \"Servant Problem,\" its mission merged with that of middle-class employers, thus ultimately serving to preserve social strati cation and oppressive class relations. The \"Servant Problem\" Say what we will, turn from it as we may , the one problem which more than any other incessantly confronts woman is that of domestic service. It annoys her and vexes her as does no other question. And despite all the discussion which has been waged, the problem still fails of being any nearer to a practical solution. 24 Finding a good servant lay at the root of the \"Servant Problem\" that plagued middle-class house- wives and working-class domestics alike. Looking closely at the nature of the \"Servant Problem\" reveals a complex relationship between middle and upper class employers and working girls, and ultimately implicates the reform school in helping to maintain class strati cation by preparing girls to meet the middle-class image of the ideal servant. Throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the \"Servant Problem\" vexed both em- ployers and workers. For employers, nding a good servant seemed nearly impossible. Middle-class homemakers thought that servants were generally unkempt, dishonest and immoral, and feared that they would bring crude working-class mannerisms into the middle-class home. Additionally , servants were thought to be arrogant, stubborn, presumptuous, and disrespectful of proper class relations. From a worker's standpoint, the attitudes of employers posed the greatest obstacle to successful relations. Servants generally viewed employers as demanding, snobbish, condescending, and determined to main-tain the role of master. While there were always many girls searching for work, most did not view domes-tic service as a desirable option. A factory worker only subjected herself to an unkind boss throughout the day , but was freed in the evenings to dress as she liked and see whom she pleased. But a domestic servant was on call throughout the night, and sacri ced autonomy in making personal decisions and in participating in the leisure activities of youth culture. Most girls preferred long hours and dangerous conditions in factories to the restricted freedom and social stigma of domestic service. 25 Domestic service was, however, a common option for orphans and delinquents. A history of child labor in America reveals the occupation of poor children, orphans, and wayward girls in middle-class homes. In one scheme reported by Good Housekeeping , reformers \"selected eight girls from about the city , children of helpless parents\" and organized a school in 1895 dedicated to \"the training and care of home-less girls for the useful occupation of domestic service.\" 26 When girls received parole from reformatories, they were placed in middle-class homes to begin an upstanding and respectable life as a servant, and schools such as Whittier would point to these placements as evidence of their success. 27 Some reformers went so far as to consider domestic service an alternative to reformatories, claiming that the gentle infl u- ences of the middle-class home would guide the moral education of the nation's depraved children. Reform schools and domestic service were so closely tied in employers' and reformers' minds that the issue of rebellious girls and rebellious workers was often confl ated. In Good Housekeeping , the author of an article entitled \"Why Boarding Schools for Girls\" discussed the bene ts of boarding school for the development of working girls: Boarding schools are an unfortunate necessity . Home is the place for the girl-and the boy , as well-when the conditions are what they should be. It develops her as no boarding school can; it trains her, in nature's great school, in lessons of responsibility , unsel shness, practical help-Explorations: An Undergraduate Research The \"Servant Problem\" and California's Reform School, 1890-1915 fulness, and love, which can be taught nowhere else so happily and so well. But, unfortunately , the conditions of the family life may be such as not to give her the best chance to learn either these lessons or those the schools are supposed to teach....[Boarding] School gives another invaluable discipline, that of steady , uninterrupted work. 28 This excerpt is eerily similar to those describing the aims and intentions of the Whittier School. It touches on the role of the family and the desirable female qualities of unsel shness and dutifulness, and it suggests the boarding school as a solution to instill in the girls a sense of discipline and work ethic. Reformers and employers alike praised the bene t of reformatories and boarding schools for girls. Despite their good intentions, however, the reformers' agenda often resulted in repression and dis- content. While the middle-class home ideally would provide an environment conducive to reform, the stigma of domestic service and the tense relationship between employer and worker often thwarted the aim of providing an instructive, nurturing home, one that mimicked the Christian family life that most unruly girls lacked. Most workers, for example, felt some degree of hostility or degradation in their homes-and with good cause, if we take the following to represent a widespread employer attitude: She is the worker who announces that she is capable of doing almost anything that you could wish; who talks much of honesty and honor, and who, at the same time, deceives you whenever she can. She is not honest in her work nor in her words. When you are looking at her she is industrious, when your eyes are off her she is lazy . Her manner to you is almost subservient. In speaking of you she is impertinent and unladylike. Any kindness which may be shown her she regards as her right, rather than as her privilege. She has never realized what a sham she is, and she does not know-more's the pity!-how bad her example is. Claiming to do much, she is absolutely perfect in nothing. Coming to her work is a bore, going from it a release from prison. 29 Class consciousness lay at the root of the animosity between workers and employers. Employers used servants as symbols of status, and middle-class housewives carefully preserved a social distance between themselves and their servants. One servant noted, \"I am distinctly [made to feel] I am a servant, as the mistress arti cially created the wide gap between her and me.\" 30 Although some recognized that the issue of social status interfered with domestic service, and therefore attempted to form harmonious relationships, most households continued to employ servants as a show of prosperity , with actual ef - ciency mattering little. Along with class consciousness, white middle-class anxieties over race and national origin com- plicated the relationships between employers and their servants. Some employers, like the woman who wrote to Ladies' Home Journal with advice for those \"housewives who wish part-time service [but] are unwilling to take foreigners or colored helpers,\" would hire only native-born white women. 31 Other employers ranked their preferences for European-born immigrants, with English as the most desirable, followed by Scots, Scandinavians, and Germans, while still others scrutinized religion and would employ only pious Protestant girls. 32 This anxiety prompted reformers to argue that attempts at assimilation de ned an immigrant as American, and spurred schools like Whittier to develop a curriculum that em- phasized American history , language, and holidays. Complicating these anxieties over race, class, and nationality was the premise that education would lead to re nement. Education and re nement were vague terms subject to personal interpretation. In many cases, education referred not to intellectual capabilities but to sophistication.33 A sophisticated servant un- derstood the way a middle-class home functioned-knowing such etiquette as how properly \"to open the Explorations: An Undergraduate Research Journal 200384Jaclynn Davis door, salute the guest, [and the] language to be used according to the rank of the guests and how to han- dle the name card.\"34 This re nement ensured that a servant's lower-class origins and crude mannerisms did not intrude upon the middle- or upper-class home. But a re ned servant needed to be very careful not to put on airs that might suggest she possessed the same degree of sophistication as her employer. Maintaining this precarious balance between working-class servant and middle-class housekeeper de ned the essence of a good servant. A good servant met an employer's speci c preferences in regard to race, ethnicity , religion, and personality . A good servant was quiet and pleasant, docile and obedient. She cheerily performed tasks without resenting her work or her employer, and she showed appreciation for the kindness of her masters. A good servant embraced her station in life, gratefully accepting the accom-modations and food offered her. Employers demanded that a servant acknowledge her subservient role while simultaneously showing contentment with her good fortune at being employed in that household. Although some readers of popular ladies' magazines recognized the injustice in a system that, as one woman wrote, \"[taught] the poor to be content with their lot,\" 35 most employers expected servants to express gratitude for their positions, despite poverty or oppression. Thus, in order to be a \"good\" servant, a girl had to negotiate the treacherous waters between her working-class station, which she must never forget, and the middle-class mannerisms of her employer's home, which she was expected to mimic perfectly , yet without aspiring to the sophistication that they implied. Although she was expected to uphold re nement and elegance, she remained a working girl whose sophistication served the sole purpose of pleasing her employers. Catherine Beecher Stowe, the Victorian dictator of good housekeeping, praised the ideal servant as a \"tall, well-dressed young person, grave, unobtrusive, self-respecting, yet not in the least presuming.\" 36 This highly speci ed ideal image served to maintain repressive conditions for domestic workers. Servants subjected themselves to insult and poor treatment. They were frequently over-worked and un-der-respected and sometimes even underfed. 37 Employers continued to engage servants as a symbol of status, and they continued to lament the \"Servant Problem\" with airs of racial, religious, and intellectual superiority . The severity of the \"Servant Problem\" concerned some employers more than pressing social issues. In an article entitled \"Woman's Most Vexing Problem,\" one employer lamented the state of domes-tic service and the lack of any solution. He suggested that: First of all, women must drop a lot of outside problems with which they are at present grappling....Foreign missions, the ballot, the higher education of women, good government, the amelioration of the poor-it will be well enough for women to labor for all these causes when their own more immediate problems are settled. The servant-girl problem is far more important at present than any of these....The heathens in African lands ought to be civilized. No one will dispute that. But true charity begins at home, and we have heathens in a few of our kitchens who need civilizing and educational infl uences just as much as the na- tives of India's coral strand. 38 Here, the familiar racial and ethnocentric rhetoric of the \"civilizing mission\" is directed toward the \"Servant Problem.\" Compared to the \"heathens in African lands\" whom missionaries sought to civilize, domestic servants endured an occupation that consistently subjected them to a brand of denigration and humiliation that one servant described as \"disgraceful.\" 39 Of course, most domestics failed to meet the ideal expectations of a servant. Breaches of the ideal image were numerous, and included a girl who, although \"satisfactory in every other respect becomes objectionable through lack of adequate personal cleanliness.\" 40 Many employers considered immorality inevitable, and, assuming that \"servants [could not] be trusted and depended upon,\"41 expected dishon-Explorations: An Undergraduate Research Journal 200385Teaching the Bad Girls: The \"Servant Problem\" and California's 1890-1915 esty , theft, and sexual promiscuity . Dealing with those servants whom they considered stupid or lazy presented yet another challenge for mistresses. Ladies' magazines lled pages with advice on how to handle unruly or inef cient domestics. From such accounts, a picture of the employer's plight emerges: the perfect worker was indeed hard to nd. To those prospective employers and to reformers alike, the reform school promised a solution. Both a home and an institution, schools such as Whittier taught both working skills and re ned decorum. Whittier would attempt to mold girls in the ideal image of the servant outlined by Stowe and her con-temporaries. By catering to this middle-class ideal, a standard that repressed and degraded working girls, Whittier helped to maintain class-consciousness and social strati cation and inequalities-ironically , one of the very things that reformers such as Stowe were attempting to combat. In educating delinquent girls to meet the demanding standards of an ideal servant, Whittier succeeded in shaping the working-class girl even after her parole. Rather than simply containing adolescent rebellion, the school's program of reform relegated the girls to a line of work that supported the status quo in class relations as well. A Servant in Training: Life at Whittier Here the wayward girl will be taught to ply the needle, t the garment, and cook the food; here the poor unfortunates, who have been regarded as the destined producers of illegitimate offspring, with whom our pris-ons and reformatories are stocked, will nd a temple of ethics where the infl uence of reclaiming love will lift them into a realm of purity , hope- fulness and a life to be enjoyed. 42 Caught between Victorian assumptions of gender, sexuality and class, and a generation that would forge a new de nition of womanhood, the Whittier State School operated for twenty- ve years with contradictory forces informing its curriculum and practices. The girls followed a strict daily schedule of work, classes, lectures, and regulations designed to solve the \"Servant Problem\" by encouraging the development of the ideologies, industry , mannerisms, and character desired by employers. Every aspect of their lives, from mealtime rules and merit systems to uniforms and housing, attempted to mold the domestic servant, and the curriculum and lifestyle suggest that reformers equated the standards of reform with the standards of a good servant. Both the curriculum and the routines at Whittier were dictated by the goal of cultivating the desired balance between re ned manners and working skills. As an industrial school, Whittier was an institution of regulations and routine that molded ef cient workers. But its curriculum went further, attempting to establish in the girls a sense of pride in their work, and qualities such as cheerfulness and eagerness that were demanded by employers. Even more importantly , because employers desired a girl whose presence did not intrude upon the re nement of the household, Whittier structured its living spaces to mimic the middle-class home, thus introducing the girls to their future work environment. Throughout their stay , the girls were being shaped through lectures on the meaning of womanhood, acclimation to an American culture, and the value of purity and piety . Through these four lessons-in ef ciency , in work ethic, in middle-class environment and in desirable character-the girls were supposed to leave Whittier as ideal servants for the middle classes. As an institution of industrial training, Whittier established strict time schedules and numerous rules and regulations, insisted on ef ciency and subservience, and in every way mimicked the standards and expectations of future employers. Work occupied the majority of the girls' day . The reformatory curriculum focused on housekeeping, sewing, laundry , cooking and millinery , while largely neglecting academic studies. These were, after all, working girls, with no need for learning beyond simple reading Explorations: An Undergraduate Research Journal 200386Jaclynn Davis and arithmetic. An educated girl, both in the reformatory and in the middle-class home, was not so much intelligent as she was trained . The girls worked, and they worked hard. The monotony of reformatory life also prepared the girls for their future employment. Routine and repetition dictated the girls' day . An article on the desirable features of a reformatory maintained that a strict schedule with limited freedom would \"accustom them to the routine which is so necessary an ele-ment in the life of a successful laboring [woman].\" Girls who failed to follow the schedule were denied meals as punishment. The day began early with a rising bell, followed by several more bells signaling the inspection of bed and clothing, the time to leave the dorm, the completion of a meal, the start of work. These bells served as a primary means of communication between the girls and their instructors, much as they would later between servants and their employers. As one girl warned another who was just about to begin a job as a servant, \"It's the bell...it's her own bell, and she'll jingle it in the middle o' the night if she takes a no-tion.\" 43 The girls were thereby trained that bells represented an authority to which they must submit. In the same spirit, throughout the day , the girls moved about the school in straight lines, marching quietly . One girl described this routine in a poem that reveals the strictness of life at Whittier: Co. B's Daily Routine Very early in the morning Company B have to rise, And oh! What a time we have in opening our eyes,Then hastily we dress and spread our beds neat, When the second bell rings we stand straight on our feet.But in all this not a sound should be heard,It is all strict silence, not a whisper, not a word,With the word 'Face,' we silently turn; with 'Pass,'We step together and steadily downstairs we go. 44 The girls learned to move when directed, instructed by bells and commands. They learned to be obedient, quiet and subdued. In effect, they were being programmed to follow a very speci c routine. At the same time, Whittier also attempted to mold their students into servants who enjoyed work, who took pride in their duties and displayed a cheerful and eager work ethic. To convince the girls to embrace their social and economic role as domestic workers, the school extolled the virtues of the vari-ous departments to suggest the rewards the girls would reap from their hard work. These departments refl ected the division of labor in the middle-class home and the specialization of servants. For instance, working in the kitchen was \"considered a great favor, for the warmth from the large range gives comfort to the outer woman, and the odors of the delicious cooking, suggests comfort to the inner woman.\" 45 The school insisted that the girls feel privileged to do their work, thus \"establishing a feeling of personal responsibility and duty .\" 46 Instructors also associated happiness with hard work, acceptance, and adapt- ability . One Whittier publication advised students, \"You will notice that some people are miserable wher-ever you can put them. Perhaps some girl is miserable in this school. Girls, that is not the way to live. We should get the real harmony out of life and you get it as easy in this school as anywhere else. Adjust yourself with your surroundings and you will be sure to live more contentedly and happy .\" 47 The girls at Whittier may not have accepted their lot or enjoyed their work, but they certainly understood that they were supposed to. Whether earnestly desiring instructors' approval or simply at- tempting to earn parole, the girls reported their love of industry and their hopes to learn more. One girl commented, \"I have a great interest in housekeeping,\" and another asserted, \"I am going to stay in the kitchen till I learn the trade well.\" 48 A girl who worked in the \"Sunrise Laundry\" department claimed that she \"wouldn't give up [her] place\" there because of \"the fun we have in the laundry .\"49 Explorations: An Undergraduate Research Journal 200387Teaching the Bad Girls: The \"Servant Problem\" and California's Reform School, 1890-1915 Whittier also taught the girls to be content with their station in life and their role as workers. Speakers at the school noted that \"the American girl does not fully appreciate the advantages she has, for she is often heard to complain,\"50 and so instructed the girls to embrace their lot. This call echoes that of the wealthy society women, their future employers, who complained of the burdens of money and directed lower classes to gratefully accept their poverty . Middle-class magazines, too, often agreed that working girls should embrace their station and gratefully accept the kindness bestowed upon them by their wealthy superiors. The school reinforced this idea by presenting gifts to particularly well-behaved girls, providing in- centives for hard work coupled with the appropriate attitude. There was an emphasis on outward appear-ance not only in demeanor but in dress as well: \"[E]very girl...[was] supposed to have her dress buttoned and her shoes tied,\" her hair brushed and her personal belongings tidied. 51 A prohibition against adorn- ments echoed employers' demands that a good servant should not \"wear gewgaws of any sort.\"52 Whittier stressed that \"the girls that are wanted are girls of sense,/Whom fashion can never deceive.\"53 The stan- dard uniform at Whittier was therefore plain and simple. The girls wore gray dresses with buttons that matrons expected to be kept clean and mended. Yet the school allowed and encouraged one addition to the standard uniform. As a reward for exemplary work and behavior, Whittier presented a good girl with cuffs and a collar to add to her standard grey dress. In the complete out t, then, a Whittier girl resembled a young domestic servant dressed for a day's work. On holidays the girls also enjoyed additional rewards for their hard work. Holidays provided a break from strict regulations, yet still served the girls' training. On Thanksgiving, Christmas and Easter, the din-ing room resounded with talk and laughter. Girls donned Easter hats or Christmas bows, earned through hard work in the sewing room. Yet on these special occasions, the speakers were reformers, clergymen, and patrons who made toasts and gave lectures. The girls answered questions and informed visitors about their experience at the school. They sang songs and read stories prepared to impress the guests, and the festivities generally focused on portraying the best possible side of Whittier and its training successes. The girls worked especially hard to prepare the grounds-cleaning, cooking, and mending for weeks in advance-and instructors claimed that \"it [was] gratifying to the girls to know that...recent visitors [had commented] on the ne appearance which the polished fl oors and immaculate tidiness presents.\" 54 These holidays gave girls experience in serving their future employers as they cooked, served, and cleared the entire meal. While holiday festivities certainly gave the girls a chance to celebrate and while their hard work bene ted their own celebration-no doubt they enjoyed the songs, decorations and warmth about the school-amidst all the festivities the girls remained in training, with Whittier holidays providing the opportunity to publicly advertise the school's success. While Whittier emphasized both the ef ciency and pride of working-class skill, it also catered to employers' demands for a servant with middle-class mannerisms. A truly good servant knew how to work hard while maintaining the re nement and delicacy of the home. However, since the girls were unaccustomed to the structure of middle-class households, Whittier introduced the girls to their future working environment. The decoration of the school mimicked the interior of a middle-class home. The girls lived in fam- ily units called Cottages, with their own parlor, dining room, and library to replicate the structure of the middle-class household. The parlor included a sitting area where girls could spend what little free time they had knitting or reading. A piano sat in the corner where girls could display their musical skill, and a chandelier hung from the ceiling. Rather than applying donations to text books or improved industrial equipment, the school purchased \"two beautiful etchings\" to \"adorn the walls of the girls' sitting room.\" 55 The dining room was an \"an attractive corner in the Girls' Department\" that was \"about as cheerful and homelike a room as one would wish to nd anywhere. Overlooking the beautiful shrubberies and Explorations: An Undergraduate Research Journal 200388Jaclynn Davis palms and shaded by the climbing rose bushes with the bright sunlight peeping in, it can scarcely fail to shed a little sunshine over the lives of its occupants.\"56 At long tables laid with white cloths and fl ower vases, the girls glimpsed the re ned dining of middle-class households. The girls also enjoyed access to a library , where they read the novels of \"miss Alcott,\" \"mrs burnett,\" Wallace, Scott and Dickens, as well as magazines like Ladies' Home Journal , Good Housekeeping , and Harpers . 57 Rather than reading the dime novels and adventure heroine stories so popular among working women,58 the girls at Whittier enjoyed ne literature by respected American and British writers, along with the journals and magazines read by middle-class homemakers. While the girls enjoyed a decorated sitting room, charming dining room, and even a library , their personal living conditions were spare, thus preparing them for the lifestyle of a servant. The dormitory housed approximately twenty girls. T wenty beds sat side-by-side with only a few feet between each girl. A narrow shelf held each girl's few personal belongings. There was no need for closet space, as the girls' wardrobes were limited to the school uniform. Similarly , domestic servants worked in beautiful homes, but their own rooms were usually cramped, with only very basic furniture and no decorative additions. Some servants even shared beds. 59 The cheerful light illuminating the reformatory dining room was typi- cal of a middle-class home, as was the cramped living space in the servants' quarters. The sharp contrast between the luxury of the school parlor, where the girls spent very limited time, and the cramped and spare conditions of the living quarters mimicked exactly the situation they would face as domestic ser-vants, thus reinforcing and promoting the girls' acceptance of class distinctions. A girl at the school could, however, earn a private room. The school rewarded outstanding girls with a place in the Honor Home. Here, a nearly reformed girl close to parole occupied her own bedroom, a \"quiet and happy domicile.\" Reformers guessed that nothing \"could be more delightful to any young girl than to have a tiny bedroom all to herself,\" and so a place in the Honor Home became a tremendous in-centive for hard work and proper behavior, a \"coveted home\" for the girls of Whittier. 60 Similarly , ladies' magazines and reformers advised employers to provide private bedrooms for good servants as a reward and incentive for proper service, noting that \"good surroundings are potent civilizers, and a house-ser-vant whose room is well and carefully furnished feels an added value in herself, which makes her treat herself respectfully in the care of her room.\" 61 Whether or not a girl lived in the cramped dormitory or in the Honor Home, the school still main- tained a distinction between sleeping quarters and public spaces. While the girls enjoyed meals in the beautifully decorated dining room, the strict regulations that accompanied their dining ensured that the girls would not grow accustomed to luxury . They were to serve the meals, not enjoy them, and so the girls lined up outside the dining room, entered in a single le of quiet marching, stood for grace, and then sat to eat in silence, with only twenty minutes allotted for the meal. Dining was neither relaxing nor enjoy-able. A matron oversaw the room and disciplined as necessary . If a girl arrived late, she suffered hunger until the next meal. One inmate described in a poem the strict demeanor required in the dining room and the consequence for transgressing the rules: \"On line we stand till every gure is straight./Miss Wall says, 'Woe betide the youngster that is late.'/You may wonder why , but well we all know/Our comrade without her breakfast will have to go.\" 62 So despite the \"cheerful and homelike\" decor of the dining room, the girls learned to remain formal and obedient, eating quickly and silently .63 They dined in a middle-class environment to accustom them to a middle-class home, but they were not allowed to feel any sense of belonging or comfort in that envi-ronment. Similarly , the library housed books by Wallace and Stevens, but exposure to them served more as training for service in the middle-class home than as educational material for the girls' intellectual stimulation. After all, the girls were surely responsible for dusting these books as well, just as they would be in their future employment. Whittier thus ensured that the girls would not only be familiar with their Explorations: An Undergraduate Research Journal 200389Teaching the Bad Girls: The \"Servant Problem\" and California's Reform School, 1890-1915 future working environment, but also understand their appropriate place within that environment. They were taught to know the shared spaces of the middle-class home, but to interact within them only as servants. Whittier also taught the girls about relationships with their future employers through the strict yet maternal role assumed by the school's instructors. Girls' comments depict the instructors as rm mater- nal gures who provided both nurture and discipline. A girl who wrote about her position in the Sunrise Laundry also revealed the nature of her relationship with \"Mama Thompson,\" who oversaw the laundry department and \"is proud of us, every one,\" although \"sometimes she gets cross.\" 64 Similarly , to the girls, Miss Wall of the housekeeping department \"is just like a mother\" and \"Miss Love is just like a mother to all of us kitchen girls. We all love her dearly .\" 65 While Miss Wall also oversaw mealtimes and disciplined girls by denying food, the girls felt obligated to write of her as \"our kind matron and mother.\"66 The girls repeatedly expressed gratitude and love for their instructors' rmness. Perhaps these sentiments refl ect the girls' knowledge of what they were supposed to say rather than what they actually felt, but this obedience to a strict parental gure was not unlike the relationship between many servants and employers. An advice column in Ladies' Home Journal suggested that when employing a new servant, the employer should welcome her warmly and \"try to make the new maid feel as much at home as possible.\" At the same time, the magazine cautioned middle-class ladies about \"re-membering that over-familiarity , even though meant in kindness, is not the best way of making a servant feel perfectly at home.\" The columnist suggested that an employer play a dual role, one that was both commanding and nurturing, advising employers to \"Be rm and kind, and when you give an order see that it is obeyed.\" 67 This advice describes exactly the role that the matrons at Whittier played. While Whittier went to these lengths to ensure that employers' demands would be ful lled, it sought also to re ne the girls' character. In response to employers' frequent complaints about workers' bad qualities, their accusations of servants' immorality and crudeness, their diatribes against the uncivilized heathens who intruded upon the sanctity of the middle-class home with their foreign lower-class habits, 68 the Whittier curriculum indoctrinated the girls with middle-class social and cultural ideology . In essence, employers were asking for good American girls. And so the stories and articles typical of the Whittier publications encouraged assimilation by glorifying American Presidents and important historical events. Photographs and biographies of American heroes such as Abraham Lincoln helped to Americanize for-eign-born girls and make them more desirable to employers. Similarly , stories of traditional Christmas celebrations and baseball games relayed American cultural values. The girl who assimilated into American culture by learning English, practicing Protestantism, and valuing American cultural traditions and hob-bies would fare better than the girl who remained thoroughly attached to her culture and language. The girls also received great praise for their quick learning and for their command of the English language. The school taught the girls how to be desirable ladies in the model of Victorian American womanhood, valuing purity and piety above all else. Teaching purity , however, provided a special challenge. After all, the girls, according to society's standards, were sexual delinquents, and so one might expect that Whittier felt compelled to address this issue. Surprisingly , however, while other reformatories and charity leagues, prompted by Progressive ide-als, were establishing programs of sex education, Whittier remained fairly silent on the matter, or dealt with it in oblique ways. Whittier instructors and lecturers spoke often of purity and virtue, for instance, but the actual issue of sex remained veiled in the rhetoric of Victorian womanhood. Although Progressive reformers voiced a view of women as self-determined sexual actors rather than victims of male lust, Whittier's curriculum sought to encourage the Victorian standard of female \"passionlessness.\" 69 Because this view of womanhood prized piety above all else, religious instruction and missionary rhetoric played a central role in the education of the Whittier girls. Piety was a necessity for proper wom-Explorations: An Undergraduate Research Journal 200390Jaclynn Davis en, and Christianity was highly desired by most employers. Despite a diverse inmate population that in- cluded Irish and Mexican Catholics, Eastern European Jews and Chinese Buddhists, it was Protestantism that reigned at Whittier. Every Sunday brought a new lecturer to the school, frequently a minister or a female missionary in ne clothes who had just returned from some far-off land with stories of jungles and heathens and the Good Word of Jesus Christ. While the school certainly hoped to convert many of the girls, these visits served other purposes as well. The missionary talks used the language of the \"civilizing mission,\" with the dual purpose of civiliz-ing the girls and also encouraging them to take up the reins of moral and religious instruction in order to continue the good work of missionaries. In one notable instance, a Miss Miller shared her experience \"out in the deep, tangled jungles [of India], in rude little bamboo huts\" with \"the ones whose souls she was to win for the Father of all.\" Employing language heavy with racial determinism, ethnocentrism and religious intolerance, she told of \"a legend that had descended for ages from father to son on down [that] told of one, true, living God, and of the white foreigner, who was to bring the white book, which would teach them of this God, the knowledge of whom, they had lost through sin.\" Here, the girls received a lesson not just in Christianity and how it could lift them out of sin, but in the moral, intellectual and religious superiority of whites as well. As Miss Miller continued, she told the \"sad, sweet, story of little Zathee. How she grew from baby- hood with heathens all about her, had never heard of Christ. How when about sixteen, she attended a mission school, there learned of the wonderful Savior, and gave her heart, and better still, her hand to Him and His work.\" 70 The story of Zathee is remarkably parallel to the common view of delinquent girls who, raised in \"the mass of ignorance and vice\" and \"locked in heavy bars of degeneracy , heredity , igno-rance and environment,\" came to Whittier as \"poor mental and physical anomalies, whose character and temperament have been transmitted to them.\" Reformers remembered that \"in the beginning man was created in God's image,\" and so, just as Miss Miller saved the souls of Indian heathens, Whittier acknowl-edged that, in the delinquent girl, \"the soul is there-there and half awakened.\" Rather than attending a mission school at age sixteen like little Zathee, the delinquent girls attended Whittier. While Zathee went on and \"taught many people the ways of God,\" Miss Miller insisted that \"we American girls must rouse ourselves, and do more for the cause of humanity . Surely we will not allow ourselves to be out-done by a poor un-taught Karen girl.\" 71 Here, in this single lecture, the paradox at the heart of a Whittier education becomes most apparent. The girls are inferior and godless working girls, but also American missionaries, an occupation generally reserved for good middle-class Christian ladies. The girls are both the object and the directors of the civilizing mission. They are poor little Zathees, but also Miss Millers. In this, as in so many other ways, listening to the lectures at Whittier gave the girls a preview of the life of domestic service into which they soon would go. Employers were part of the middle- and upper-class culture whose ideology made them partners in \"the civilizing mission.\" Just as reformers joined a movement for social and moral progress, so, too, did employers sense that they \"should be morally responsible for [their servants]...when they are in our employ , especially young girls and boys.\" 72 When, therefore, the girls did not quite meet the employers' expectations in some regard, they could expect to be reminded of their \"heathen\" natures, as one employer did when he intoned that it was \"the heathens in a few of our kitchens who need civilizing and educational infl uences just as much as the natives of India's coral strand.\" 73 Employers thus expected the girls to come to them displaying all the characteristics of an already- civilized and pious girl, yet simultaneously maintained a sense of moral superiority over the girls they hired. At Whittier, the girls learned to t that ideal image as closely as possible and received rewards for approaching or achieving it. They mastered the art of marching quietly , making their beds speedily , eat-ing quickly and in silence, responding to bells and one-word commands, polishing fl oors, washing linen, Explorations: An Undergraduate Research Journal 200391Teaching the Bad Girls: The \"Servant Problem\" and California's Reform School, 1890-1915 cooking dinner and serving respected guests from the middle-class religious and reform movement. They dusted the piano in the parlor, even if they seldom enjoyed free time to play it. They set the fl owers out in a light- lled dining room, even if they had to sit in a sober silence and nish their meal in only twenty minutes. They quickly glanced over the books of Wallace, Stevens and Scott, even if they seldom attended reading or writing courses. And they worked ef ciently , quietly , and routinely , only to return to a cramped corner in a dormitory , vowing constantly to work harder and more quietly in hopes of earning a private room. The girls thus learned to achieve a careful balance between working-class skill and middle-class mannerisms and sophistication. If they continued to obey and behave as they had at Whittier, they would indeed solve the \"Servant Problem\" for some very satis ed families. Conclusion The Whittier Girls' Department functioned for about twenty- ve years in the midst of tremendous social and cultural change. At a time when the dominant gender, cultural, and class ideologies were be-ing challenged and destabilized, Whittier girls entered the school as pioneers of a revolution for sexual, social, and economic autonomy , and left as pawns in the maintenance of class-consciousness and tradi-tional gender roles. The \"Girl Problem\" and the \"Servant Problem\" were ultimately one and the same. Both challenged dominant middle-class ideologies; both fed off middle-class fear at the threat presented by working-class girls. Reformers saw working girls as transgressors of sexual propriety; middle-class employers regarded them as transgressors of proper class relations. Reformers felt threatened by a revolution in gender roles and sexuality , by the economic independence of working girls that had somehow led to claims of sexual agency as well; middle-class employers felt threatened by their demands for respect, by the challenge they posed to white Christian American superiority , and by their presumption of equality . Reformers and employers alike not only felt threatened, but also sensed a moral mission at hand. In their attempts to shape girls into subdued servants, they followed what they believed to be their social duty as white, Christian, middle-class Americans. Their vision of wayward girls as ideal domestic ser-vants was neither intentionally nor knowingly repressive. Yet the moral crusade held repressive implica-tions, and despite virtuous intentions, reformers' and employers' moral obligation to servants was all too often shaded by anxiety , hostility , and disregard. The training at Whittier State School embodied these tensions. Whittier shaped girls who conformed to an image desired by middle-class employers of one of the most class-conscious and stigmatized lines of work available, and in so doing, the school assisted in the continued and repressive regulation of working girls. While not all girls sought or continued employment as domestic workers, the lessons they learned at Whittier served them in the same ways, whether they became factory workers, laundresses, or wait-resses. The school shaped girls into an ideal held by the middle and upper classes who clung to earlier ideas of racial determinism, class superiority , and Protestant righteousness. The school shaped servants, and thereby helped to preserve strati ed class relations and oppressive working conditions. Rather than improving the lives of the girls, it solved a major problem for the middle classes. And so, while 1890 is often cited as the beginning of the Progressive Era, Whittier exposes the dif- culty in \"marking\" the beginning of an era. It also exempli es what often happens in a society that is in the process of clarifying its values and its self-image, as confl icting ideologies tug and pull at each other, sometimes catching the innocent between them.Explorations: An Undergraduate Research Journal 200392Jaclynn Davis Notes 1.
