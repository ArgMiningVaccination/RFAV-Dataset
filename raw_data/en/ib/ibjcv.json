Wasteful as this is, it's not enough for chiropractors, who have successfully lobbied to have two Congressmen propose a new bill, [HR3654](https://www.congress.gov/116/bills/hr3654/BILLS-116hr3654ih.xml), that will require Medicare to pay chiropractors for the full range of services that real doctors offer. The American Chiropractic Association is practically [rubbing its (metaphorical) hands together with glee](https://www.acatoday.org/Advocacy/Legislative-Regulatory-Policy/Medicare). As they proudly point out, this endorsement of quackery is bipartisan: the bill is sponsored by two New York Congressman, Democrat Brian Higgins and Republican Tom Reed. The idea of having chiropractors function as regular physicians is very troubling. Chiropractors do not receive proper medical training: they get their Doctor of Chiropractic (D.C.) degrees from one of a very small number of special chiropractic schools, which do not provide the full medical training that real medical schools do. Their curriculum also includes a heavy dose of pseudoscience, especially the training around subluxations. For a detailed discussion of why chiropractors are not competent to be family physicians, I recommend [this article](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/chiropractors-as-family-doctors-no-way/) by an experienced physician, Dr. Harriett Hall, titled \" [Chiropractors as family doctors? No way!](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/chiropractors-as-family-doctors-no-way/)\" Dr. Hall goes into considerable detail explain why many of the medical practices of chiropractors are non-standard, not evidence-based, and possibly harmful. Or see [this lengthy takedown of chiropractic subluxations](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/chiropractic-vertebral-subluxations-science-vs-pseudoscience/) by Sam Homola, a former chiropractor. Many chiropractors are also anti-vaccine, unfortunately, as documented just two weeks ago in [this article](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/anti-vaccination-ideology-in-chiropractic-continuing-education-and-conferences-again/) by attorney Jann Bellamy. Among other things, Bellamy points out that a major chiropractic conference this fall will feature a keynote talk by anti-vaccine activist Robert Kennedy Jr. ( [about whom I've written before](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevensalzberg/2014/07/20/robert-kennedys-dangerous-anti-vaccine-activism/)). Even more alarming, [as I've explained before](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevensalzberg/2015/03/02/nih-distorts-report-on-chiropractic-and-stroke-risk/), is that chiropractic neck manipulation has been shown to carry a small but real risk of stroke, because it can create a tear in your vertebral arteries. For example, [this report from 2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5167612/) documented a case of cerebral hemorrhage apparently caused by chiropractic manipulation. The patient in that case was a 75-year-old woman, which puts her squarely in the class of patients [eligible for Medicare](https://www.hhs.gov/answers/medicare-and-medicaid/who-is-elibible-for-medicare/index.html). And to those chiropractors who've read this far: I'm sorry that you were hoodwinked into spending 3-4 years in a chiropractic school, [paying nearly $200,000 in tuition and fees](http://www.palmer.edu/admissions/financial-aid/tuition/), with the promise that you'd be a legitimate medical professional. You were scammed, and I'm sorry about that. And I understand that most (perhaps all) chiropractors want to help their patients. The problem is, the training offered by chiropractic colleges is far short of a proper medical degree. If the chiropractors' lobbying association succeeds, the $545 million spent annually by Medicare (that's the 2015 total, and it has undoubtedly increased) will soon become a far higher amount-to the detriment of patients. The proposed bill will allow chiropractors to charge Medicare for pretty much any service that a bona fide physician offers. It's also worth noting that in 2018, [Medicare's Inspector General issued a report](https://ijr.com/medicare-issued-millions-improper-chiropractic-payments/) titled \"Medicare needs better controls to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse related to chiropractic services,\" which revealed that almost half of Medicare spending on chiropractic care from 2010-2015, between $257 million and $304 million per year, was likely wasted or fraudulent. One wouldn't think this is a time to expand Medicare's coverage of chiropractic. Congress, don't be fooled by arguments that [this proposed new law](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/3654/text) will lower medical costs, or give patients what they need: it won't. Instead, it will dramatically increase the amount of funds wasted on ineffective treatments. The U.S. does need a better health care system, but this bill would be a big step in the wrong direction.
