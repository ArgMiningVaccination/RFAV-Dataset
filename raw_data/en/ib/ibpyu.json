What is the N u,tion recei ving lor this money ~ This renort explore.c; thu,t, ana. related questions. It concfudes that f[tiled to produce satisfactory in\u00ad Americtl.nG. otht',!, documents to foll\\}w~de\u00ad clare that todu,y's entire population of the elderly, and their ojf$pt-ing, suffer severe emotional damage becu,use of dread and despair associ\u00ad ated with nursing home care ill the United States today. This policy, or lack thereof, may not be solely responsible for pro\u00ad ducing such anxiety. Deep-rooted attitudes to,val'd aging and death also play maj?r roles. But the actIOns of the Congress and of States, as expressed through the Medicare and Medicaid programs, have in many ways intensified old problems and have createa new ones. Efforts have been made to deal with the most, severe of those prob\u00ad lems. Laws have been passed; nationaJ commitments have been made; declarations of high purpose have been uttered at nn.tional crmferences !l.nd by representatives of the nursing home industry. But lo?' all of that, 101/'fI~te1'7n cm'e tOl' our 1walth Ca1'C system,. It is costly and growing costlier. It is increasing in numbers, already providing more beds than there are beds in general hospitals. And there is every reason to believe that many more beds will be needed because the population of old persons in this Nation continues to grow faster than any other age group. Nursing home care 1S associated with srandal and abuse, even though the best of its leaders have helped develop vitally needed new meth~ ods of CItre and concern for the elderly, and even 'though-day in and day out-underpaid, but compassionate, aides in many homes attempt to provide a touch of humanity and tender care to patients who, though mute or confused and helpless, nevertllCless feel and appreci\u00ad ate kindness and skill. This industry, which has grown very rapidly in just a fe,~ d~cades\u00ad and most markedly since 1965, when Medicare and MedIc/tId werc enacted-could now take one of three courses : It could continue to grow as it has in the past, spurrecl on by sheer need, but marred by scandal, negativism, and murkiness about its fundamental mission. It could be mnndated to transform itself from a predominantly proprietary industry into It nonp'l'ofit ~yste~, or into one which takes on the attributes of a quasl-publIc utIlIty. Iml IV Or it could-with the informed help of Government and the general public-movo to overcome present difficulties, to improve standards of performance, alld to lit itself more successfully into a comprehensive health cal'e system in which institutionalization is kept to essentiu.lminimums.' Whatever course is taken, it is cortain that the demand for improve\u00ad ment will become more and more iImistent, 1Vithin the Congress, that clemt\\.lld has been clearly expressed in recent years, But often congressiomtl enactments luwe been thwarted by reluctant administration, or simply have been i~nored, Now, facin~ the prospect of early action upon a national health program for all age groups, the Congress must certainly consider long-term care a major p!trt of the tota.l package. Wisely used, the momentum for a total health care package could be used to insure better nursing home care. 'Within the administration, there has been drift and unresponsive\u00ad ness to congressiolUtl malldo:te since 1965. 'l'here are signs, however, that rising costs anclrising public concern have !troused certr.in mem\u00ad bers of the executive brunch to see the med for long-term eare reform more clearly tha.n before. 'l'heir actions and initiatives are welcome, but it is essential that the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare ta.]co far more effective, well-paced action than it has thus far. Everywhere, the demand for reform is intensifying. People know tlmt a nursing home could be in everyone's future. 'l'hey ask why placement in sneh a home should be the occasion ror despair and desperation, when it should be simply a sensible accom\u00ad modation to need. 'l'he Subcommittee on Long-'l'erm Care of the Senate Spechtl Com\u00ad mittee on Aging continually has asked the same question. Care for older persons'in need of long-term attention should be one of the most tender and effective services a society can offer to its people. It will be needed more and more as the number of elders Increases and as the number of very old among th~m rises even faster. \"What is needed now ~ As already indicated, the !0rthcoming debate over a national health program will offer opportunity fot' building good long-term care into a comprehensive program foL' all Americans. But the issues related to the care of the chronically ill are far from simple. 'l'angled and sometimes obscure, technical questions related to such matters are reimbursement, establishment of standards, en\u00ad forcement, and recordkeeping, often attract the attention of policy\u00ad makers, to the exclusion of other questions, such as : Could nursing homes be\u00b7 avoided for some, if other services were available ~ 1Vhat assurance is there that the right number of nursing homes are being built where they are most needed ~ \"What measures CIUl Government take to encourage I?roviders themselves to take action to improve the quality of nursmg home cal'e~ 'What can be done to encourage citizen action Itnd patient ad\u00ad vocacy at the local level ~ v Such questions intl'uc1e ,wen when the best of care is given. III othel' settings, however, scandnJ and calamity entcr the picture.; and dnrk new questions emerge. The subcommittee, in this report nnd suceeccling Supporting Pupers, recognizes the impottull('e of the nursing home industry: and it pledges e,very eft'Ol\u00b7t to continue commnnicution with rcprcslmtnthrcs of the industry and with members of the executh'e branch.

THE FACTUAL UNDERPINNING OF THIS STUDY Fifteen years of fact-gathering preceded publication of this report. In 1959, the Senute Committee 011 IJttbor and Public Wel:\u00a3are esb1.b\u00ad lished a Subcommittel) on Problems of the Aged and Aging. Findings from subcommittee reports anci hearings have been evaluated. That subcommittee acknowledged in lOGO, as this report acknowledges in 1974, that nursing homes providing excellent cnre with a wide range. of supportive services are in the minority. (xx) 41-5G7 0 -75 - 2 I I I . __ ---.J x With the establishment of the U.S. Senate Special Committee on Aging in 1961, additional hearin.gs were conducted. The most recent plinse began in 19G9 with hen,rings on \"Trends in Long-Term Care.\" Since 1969, 22 hearinl]:S were held o,nd some 3:000 po,ges of testimony were to,lmn, ns of October 1973. These hearing transcripts ha.ve provided valuable information and expert opinions, as have several supplementary studies by the sub\u00ad committee staff, the Geneml Accounting Office a.nd private groups such as Ro,lph Nader's Study Group on Nursing Homes in 1971. The Library of Congress and other congreGSional committees, as well as professional organizations such as the Americo,n Nursing Home As\u00ad sociation, }mve 0,180 been helpful. Finally, a great portion of the dato, is from the Depo,rtment of Heo,lth, Education~ o,nd lVelfare and other administ.rative or independent agencies, such as the Securities and Excho,uge Commission. The assistance of State officials proved es\u00ad pecially helpful. ORGANIZATION OF THIS STUDY The Introductory Report and this Supporting Paper will be fol\u00ad lowed by other Supporting PapN's to be published at approximately monthly intervals over the next few months. Each will deal with a fairly specific issue, and each of these issu('s will be>, examined in the detaIl ne('ded for understanding, not only by legislative and health speeiaJists, but by laymen. A study of this magnitude would be incomplete without reaction by the nursing home industry and by representatives of the execu\u00ad tive branch. Accordingly, national organizations and appropriate governmental units will be invited to submit statements within 2 months after publication of the final Supporting Paper. Finally, the subcommittee will issue a concluding report intended to up\u00ad date earlier information and to analyze the situation at that time. The format is unusual, perhaps unprecedented. But the nursing home industry is too vital a part of our health system and of the national scene for lesser treatment. MAJOR POINTS OF THIS SUPPORTING PAPER The average nursing home patient tal{es from four to seven different drugs a day (many tal{en twice or thl'ee times daily). Each patient's drug bill comes to $300 a year as compared with $87 a year for senior citizens who are not institutionalized. In aU, $300 million a year is spent for drugs, 10 percent of the Nation's total nursing home bill. Almost 40 percent of the drugs in nursing homes are central nervous system drugs, painkillers, sedatives, or tranquilizers. Tranquilizers themselves constitute almost 20 percent of total drugs-far and away the largest category of nursing home drugs. XI Drug distribution systems used by most nmsing homes al'e in\u00ad efficient and ineffective. An average home of 100 beds might have 850 different prescription bottles and 17,000 doses of medication on band. Doctors are infrequent visitors to nursing homes. Nurses are few and overworked. All too often, the responsibility for ad\u00ad ministering medications falls to aides and ol'derlies with little experience 01' training. Not surprisingly, 20 to 40 percent of nursing home drugs are administered in error. Other sel'ious consequences include: the theft and misuse of nursing home drugs; high incidence of adverse reactions; some disturbing evidence of drug addiction; and lack of adequate con\u00b7 troIs in the regulation of drug experimentation. Perhaps most disturbing is the ample evidence that nursing home patients are tranquilized to keep them quiet and to make them easier to take care of. Tragically, recent research suggests that those most likely to be tranquilized sometimes may have the best chance for effective rehabilitation. Kickbacl{s are widespread. A kickbacl{ is the practice whereby pharmacists are forced to pay a certain percentage of the price of nursing home prescription drugs back to the llursing home operator for the privilege of providing those services. The atmosphere for abuse is particularly inviting when reim\u00b7 bursement systems under Federal and State programs allow the nursing home to act as the \"middle man\" between the pharmacy (which supplies the drugs) and the source of payment (private patient, Medicare, or Medicaid). Kickbacks can be in the form of cash, long\u00b7term credit arrange\u00b7 ments, and gifts of trading stamps, color televisions, cars, boats, or prepaid vacations. Additionally, the pharmacist may be reo quired to \"l'ent\" space in the nursing home, to furnish other supplies fne of charge, or to place nursing home employees on his payroll. The average kickback is 25 percent of total prescription charges; over 60 percent of 4,400 pharmacists surveyed in California re\u00b7 ported that they had either been approached for a kickback or had a positive belief that kickbacks were widespread; these same pharmacists projected $10 million in lost accounts for failure to a&,ree to kickback proposals. XII In order to lower costs to meet ldckback demands, pharmacists admitted numerous questionable, if not illegal, practices such as: billing welfare for nonexistent prescriptions, supplying outdated drugs or drugs of questionable value, billing for refills not dis\u00ad pensed, supplying generic drugs while billing for brand names, and supplying stolen drugs which they have pUI'chased. Congressional action in 1972 to mal{e kid{backs illegal has had HttIe effect. HEW has yet to announce regulations to implement this law. MAJOR POINTS OF INTRODUCTORY REPORT (Issued Novembel' 19, 1974) Medicaid now pays about 50 percent of the Nation's more than $7.5 billion nursing home bill, and Medicare pays another 3 per\u00ad cent. 1'hus, about $1 of every $2 in nursing home revenues is publicly financed.':' There are now more nursing home beds (1.2 million) in the United States today than general and surgical hospital beds (1 million). In 1972, for the first time, Medicaid expenditures for nursing home care exceeded payments for surgical and general hospitals: 34 percent to 31 percent. Medicaid is essential for growing numbel's of elderly, particu\u00ad larly since Medicare Ilursing home benefits have dropped sharply since 1969. Average Social Security benefits for a retired couple now amount to $310 a month compared to the average nursing\u00ad home cost of $600. Medicaid (a welfare program) must be called upon to make up the diffel'ence. The growth of the industry has been impressive, Between 1960 and 1970, nursing home facilities increased by 140 percent, beds by 232 percent, patients by 210 percent, employees by 405 percent, and (Jxpenditures for <;al'e by 465 percent. Measured from 1960 through 1973, expendHure'S inci'ea!?e~' almost 1,400 percent. Despite the heavy Federal commitment to long-term care, a coherent policy on goals and methods has yet to be shaped. Thou\u00ad sands of seniors go without the care they need. Others are in facilities inapPl'opriate to their needs. Perhaps most unfortunate, -The Committee's Intro(luctory Report, ns relensed on hlllion nnd $3.7 billion the until recenth' nre ns nursing Consequently, chnnges were mnde In this report. XU! institutionalization could have been postponed or prevented for thousands of current nursing home residents if viable home health care and supportive services existed. Although such alternative forms of care may be more desirable from the standpoint of elderly patients-as well as substantially less expensive-the Department of -HEW has given only token support for such programs. Despite the sizable commitment in Federal funds, HEW has been reluctant to issue forthl'ight standards to })l'ovide patients with minimum protection. Congress in 1972 mandated the merger of Medicare and Medicaid standards, with the retention of the highest standard in every case. However, HEW then watered down the prior standards. Most leading authorities concluded at subcommittee hearings that the new standards are so vague as to defy enforcement. There is no direct Federal enforcement of these and previous Federal standards. Enforcement is left almost entirely to the States. A few do a good job, but most do not. In fact, the enforce\u00ad ment system has been characterized as scandalous, ineffective, and, in some cases, almost nonexistent. The President's program for \"nursing home reform\" has had only minimal effect since it was first announced in 1971 and actions in 1974 fall far short of a serious effort to regulate the industry. The victims of Federal policy failures have been Americans who are desperately in need of help. The average age of nursing home patients is 82; 95 percent are over 65 and 70 percent are over 70; only 10 percent are married; almost 50 percent have no direct relationship with a close relative. Most can expect to be in a nursing home over 2 years. And most will die in the nursing home. These patients generally have four or more chronic or crippling disabilities. :Most national health insurance proposals largely ignore the long-term care needs of older Americans, Immediate action is required by the Congress and executive branch to improve past policies and programs which have been piecemeal, inappropriate, altd short lived. MAJOR POINTS DF SUPPOR'l'ING PAPER NO. 1 (Issued December 17, 1974) \"TH.E LITANY OF NURSING HOME ABUSES AND AN :t.:XAMINATION OF THE ROOTS OF CONTROVERSY\" The subcommittee's Supporting Paper No.1 reveals the following were the most important nursing home abuses: Negligence leading to death and injury; Unsanitary conditions; Poor food or poor preparation; XEV Hazards to life or limb; Lach: of dental care, eye care 01' podiatry; Misappropriation and theft; Inadequate control of drugs; Reprisals against those who complain; Assault on human dign.ity; and Profiteering and \"cheating the system.\" The inevitable conclusion is that such abuses are far from \"isolated instances.\" They are widespread. Estimates of the number of substandard homes (that is, those in violation of one or more standards causing a life-threatening situation) vary from 30 to 80 percent. The subcommittee estimates at least 50 percent are substandard with one or more life-threatening conditions. These problems have their roots in contemporary attitudes toward the aging and aged. As Senator Frank E. Moss, chairman of the Subcommittee on Long-Term Care, has said: It is hell to be old in this country. The pressures of living in the age of materialism have produced a youth cult in America. Most of us are afraid of getting old. This is because we have made old age in this country a waste\u00ad land. It is T. S. Eliot's rats walking on broken glass. It's the nowhere in between this life and the great beyond. It is being .robbed of your eyesight, your mobility, and even your human dignity. Such problems also have their roots in the attitudes of the elderly toward institutionalization. Nursing home placement often is a bitter confirmation of the fears of a lifetime. Seniors fear change and uncertainty; they fear poor care and abuses; loss of health and mobility; and loss of liberty and human dignity. They also fear exhausting their savings and \"going on welfare.\" To the average older American, nursing homes have become almost synonymous with death and protracted suffering before death. However, these arguments cannot be used to excuse nursing home owners or operators or to condone poor care. Those closest to the action l'ightly must bear the greatest portion of respon\u00ad sibility. To deal with the litany of abuses, action must be tal{en imme\u00ad diately by the Congress and the executive to: (1) Develop a na\u00ad tional policy with respect to long-term care; (2) provide financial incentives in favor of good care; (3) involve physicians in the care of nursing home patients; (4) provide for the training of nursing home personnel; (5) promulgate effective standards; and (6) enforce such standards. xv Ll1AJOR POINTS OF FORTHCOLl1ING SUPPORTING PAPERS Supporting Paper No.3 \"DOCTORS IN NURSING HOMES: THE SHUNNED RESPONSIBILITY\" Physicians have, to a large degree, abdicated the responsibility for personal attention to nursing home patients. One of the reasons for their lack of concern is inadequate training at schools of medicine. Another is the negative attitude toward care of the chronically ill in this Nation. The subcommittee's May 1974 ques\u00ad tionnaire to the 101 U.S. schools of medicine indicates a serious lack of emphasis on geriatrics and long-term care: Eighty-seven percent of the schools indicated that geriatrics was not now a specialty and that they were not (!ontemplating making it one; 74 percent of the schools had no program by which students, interns, or residents could fulfill requirements by working in nursing homes; and 53 percent stated they had no contact at all with the elderly in nursing homes. Supporting Paper No. 4 \"NURSES IN NURSING HOMES: THE HEAVY BURDEN (THE RELIANCE ON UNTRAINED AND UNLICENSED PERSONNEL)\" Of the 700,000 registered nurses in this Nation, only 35,000 are found in nursing homes, and much of their time is devoted to administrative duties. From 80 to 90 percent of the care is pro\u00ad vided by over 215,000 aides and orderlies, some few of them well trained, but most litemlly hired off the streets. Most are grossly overworked and paid at or near the minimum wage. With such worldng conditions, it is understandable that their turnover is 75 percent a year. One reason for the smaH number of registered nmses in nursing homes is that present staffing standards are unrealistic. The present Federal standarcl calls for one registerecl nurse coverage only on the clay shift, ito hours a weel{, regardless of the size of the nursing home. By comparison, Connecticut requires one registered nUl'se for each 30 patients on the day shift, one for every 45 in the afternoon; and one for each 60 in the evening. Supporting Papel' No.5 \"THE CONTINUING CHRONICLE OF NURSING HOME FIRES\" In 1971, there were 4,800 nursing home fires} 38 persons were killed in multiple death fi'res and some 500 more in single death fires. An estimated $3.5 million loss was directly attributable to XVI nursing home fires. Fires in August-September of 1974 have claimed 13 lives. Nursing home patients al'e especially vulnerable to fires. Many are under sedation or bound with restraints. Physical infirmities and confusion often cause resistance to rescue. There is reason to believe the number of nursing homes failing to meet fire safety standards is actually increasing. In 1971, the General Accounting Office reported that 50 percent of U.S. nursing homes were deficient in regard to fire safety. A January 197tl study of the U.S. Office of Nursing Home Affairs said that 59 percent of skilled nursing facilities are substandard with serious, life-threatening deficiencies. The same study indi\u00ad cates that in excess of 60 percent of intermediate facilities do not comply with existing standards. The requirements are on the bool{s, but they are not heeded. Supporting' Paper No.6 ~'WHA'r CAN BE DONE IN NURSING HOMES: POSITIVE ASPECTS IN LONG-TERM CARE\" It is unjust to condemn the entire nursing home industry. There are many fine nursing homes in the United States. A growing number of administrators are insisting upon positive approaches to therapy and rehabilitation, innovations in physical structure of the physical plant; employee sensitivity training and coopera\u00ad tive agreements with local schools of nursing; and even self\u00ad government and other activities for the patients. \"Ombudsmen\" programs have been established by Presidential direction and are making some headway. In some States, the nursing home industry has launched an effort to upgrade its facilities by establishing directories, rating systems, and a \"peer review\" mechanism. These efforts offer the prospect of improving nursing home conditions if conducted in a VigOl;OUS and effective manner. In Chicago, nursing homes have a \"cool line\" telephone number for relatives, visitors, or patients who have complaints. Supporting Paper No.7 \"THE ROLE OF NURSING HOMES IN CARING FOR DISCHARGED MENTAL PATIENTS\" Thousands of elderly patients have been tI'ansferred from State mental institutions to nUl'sing homes. The number of aged in State mental hospitals decreased 4;0 percent between 1969 an.d 1973 according to subcommittee data, dropping from 133,264 to 81,912. This trend is caused partially by progressive thinking intended to reduce patient populations in lal'ge impersonal institutions. Another powerful reason, however, may be cost and the desire to substitute Federal for State clollal's. It costs the States an average XVII of $800 per patient per month to care for mental patients in State hospitals while these same individuals can be placed in boarding homes at substantially reduced cost. Charges of \"wholesale dumping\" of patients have been made in several States. Acute problems have been reported, most notably in Califol'nia, Illinois, and New York. Supporting Paper No. 8 \"ACCESS TO NURSING HOMES BY U.S. MINORITIES\" Only 4 percent of the 1 million nursing home patients in the United States are members of minority groups, even though their health needs are proportionately greater. Part of the problem is caused by cost obstacles or lac1.: of infol'maHon about Medicaid. Discrimination is the greatest obstacle to greater utilization by blades. But discrimination need not be overt; often relatives are made to feel that their parent or grandparent would not be made comfortable. In the case of Asian-Americans and Spanish-speak\u00ad ing Americans, language barriers often cause insurmountable difficulties. Cultural and other problems, including rurai isola\u00ad tion, cause problems to American Indians. Supporting Paper No.9 \"PROFITS AND THE NURSING HOME: INCEN1'IVES IN FAVOR OF POOR CARE\" Profits by nursing homes have occasioned serious and persistent controversy. Nursing home administrators say that Medicaid reimbursement rates are low and that they can hardly become the basis for profiteering. Critics say that the economics of nursing home operation, supported in such large measure by public funds, should be examined more closely and publicly than they now are. A subcommittee survey made in 1973-74, indicates that the 106 publicly held corporations controlled 18 percent of the industry's beds and accounted for one-third of the industry's $3.2 billion in revenue (as of 1972.) Betwee1l1969 and 1972 these corporations experienced the following growth: 122.6 percent in total assets; 149.5 percent in gross revenues; and 116 percent in average net income. One recent HEW study, however, shows marginal rates of return in a sample of 228 nursing homes. Thus, the issue is far from settled. But a joint study-conducted by the General Accounting Office and the subcommittee-suggest significant increases in revenues, and profits for individual operators as well. Two final documents will be issued as part of this siudy: A compendium of statements by the industl'y and administration spokesmen, and a final report by the Subcommittee on Lony-Tel'm Care. 41-557 0 -75 -3 I.

The Subcommittee on Long-Term Care of the U.S. Senate Spe\u00ad cial Committee on Aging has received extensive testimony on those questions. It has ordered studies to pinpoint CI.uestionable practices related to drng administration in long-term care l11stitutions. Subcommittee members and staff have studied extensive literature related to the many phases of medicatjon in such facilities. Part of the subcommittee concern is based upon the realizution that elderly nUl'sing home patients are highly dependent upon those who care for them, and they usually have multiple ailments and, therefore, may require varying medications. Many of their illnesses are of long duration; but they may nonetheless change, even if old medication pat\u00ad terns do not. Finally, the patient--especially if regarded us trouble\u00ad some-may be heavily tranquilized. These considerations have weighed heavily in subcommittee delib\u00ad erations on the quality of care received in nursing homes. They are explored further in this Supporting Paper. In short,an ugly pattern of prescription drug misuse, with harsh consequences to patients, exists III many nursing homes of the United States. Part of the fault lies at the door of the Federal and State officials, who have yet to launch a coordinated attack on the problem. Part of the fault lies in poor or inadequate staffing and practices within nursing homes. Part of the fault lies with drug companies and pharmicists them\u00ad selves, who have taken little notice of the special effect of drugs on the elderly. Part of the blame must be directed at the medical community which has, no~ yet given serious attention to medication problems !l.ffecting gerIatrIC patIents. And part of the fault must be laid at the door of the American pub\u00ad lic which, by remaining apathetic or unaware,allows such practices to continue. \"Inquiry Into Allege(} Improper Practices In Providing Nursing Home Care, Medical Services, and Prescribed Drugs to Old-Age Assistance Recipients In the Cleveland, Ohio, Area\", report to the Subcommittee on Long-Term Care by the General Accounting Office, Mllrch 1067, p. 62. PART 1 THE ELDERLY AND DRUGS Oldar Americans constitute 10 ;percent of the population, but receive over 25 percent of the :{>rescl'ipbons written in this Nation (as com\u00ad pared to only one-fifth III 1965).\" The average senior citizen (95 per\u00ad cent of whom are not in institutions) spends about $87 a year for drugs, but as has already been indicated, the cost for those in nursing homes is about $300 a ycar.G In all, the Nation's 1 million nursing home patients spent $300 million for drugs in 1972, constituting almost 10 percent of U.S. total nursing home expenditures.7 One reason for t,he higher institutional cost is that nursing homa patients-whose average age is 828-have three or more chronic conditions. Seventy percent of the'drugs now on the market were unavailable 20 years ago.a These new drugs are in part responsible for lengthening the life span. While the elderly tttke large numbers of drugs little notice is taken of the fact that they assimilate and tolerate ch'ugs dif\u00ad ferenly from younger Americans. An article 'in the National Council on the Aging's magazine, Pe'r\u00ad speotive o\u00b7n Aging, said recently: By virtue of the natural aging process, the elderly are less physically tolerltnt of most drugs than yopnger persons, espe\u00ad cially of metab\u00b7 olizing most drngs, more snsceptlble to direct, side, and inter\u00ad action effects, and may require smaller dosn,ges,lo The opposite side of the coin was also discllssed: There are strong indications tll[l.t younger peoplet includ\u00ad ing many who are now 'l11iclclle-aged, ft,re more tolern,nt and more conditioned to the use of drugs than the elderly ....

Moss, cha11'man of the Subcommittee on Long-Term Carl', ttsked the Geneml Accounting Office (GAO) to undertake an l.l,udit.ln GAO chose three States: Illmoisl New Jersey, and Ohio. Theil' sta\u00ad tistics cover payments by Meclimud for 4 months of the year: Janu\u00ad ary,April, July, and October. These stat\"stics confi.rm the rough figures supplied to the com\u00ad mittee by the industl'y.13 A chart with GAO's findings appears on page 247. The total cost for ch'ugs in the 4-month period was $2,\u00b7(()1,680. Cen\u00ad tral nervous system drugs (including tranquilizers, sedatives, and analgesics) accounted for 37 percent of the total (or $990,418). l\\fis\u00ad cellu.neous unclassified drugs were second with roughly 11 percent (01' $308,435). Anti-infective agents with 9 percent (or $237,366) were third, followed by gastrointestinal drugs with about 8 percent (01' $220,124). Tmnquilizers alone amounted to $524,381, which is 53 percent of all central nervous system drug costs and 19 percent of the cost of all drugs. The two strongest tranquilizers, Mellari! and Thorazine, ac\u00ad counted for 52 percent of all tmllquilizers purchased-or 10 percent of total drugs. In short, tranquilizers constitute almost 20 percent of total drugs in the GAO sample, confirming industry estimates. Pro\u00ad jecting this pel'centage nationally on the Nation's $300 million yearly drug bill would indicate that the annual cost for tran\u00ad quiIizel's in American nursing homes is $60 million. 11 Pnge Hi. source cltetlln footnote O. 1~ Drugs Provided to Elc1erly Persons In Nursing Homes Under the Medlcnld Prollrrtm.\" r~\\lOrt to the subcommittee by Sec Appcndlx 7, p. 315. 247 MEDICAID DRUG PROGRAM-ILLINOIS, NEW JERSEY, AND OHIO: NUMBI::R OF PRESCRIPTIONS AND AMOUNT PAID IN JANUARY, APRIL, JUi.Y, AND OCTOBER 1970, FOR DRUGS FOR RECIPIEj,,~ I}F OLD'AG~ ASSISTANCE IN NURS\u00b7 ~ ~ ~ ~::::: percent (I1J1nols). ao percent (New .Tersey), and 30 percent (Ohio) of n11 nmounts pnlel for drugs on bchnlr of 6,875 6,138 5,808 4,661 4,477 Most Americans associate the initiation of medications with all examination by their physician, who directs a specific conrse of ther\u00ad apy und prescribes the drugs most helpful to their needs. But doctors 248 are ini\"'t'equent visitors to nursing homes, and it is, therefore, common practice in nursing homes today for nurses to call the patient's phy\u00ad sician, who then prescribes drugs over the telephone (see Supporting Pa1?er No.3). 'l'his practice has been severely criticized, but it re\u00ad roams the most common method of anthorizing drugs for nUl'sing home patients. Once drugs are authorized, how are they distributed in nursing homes ~ First, some homes, like hospitals, have their own pharmacists who oversee drug utilization. Others employ consultant pharmacists, who visit the home periodically to supervise drug distribution, pro\u00ad vide training, and check patients for bad side effects of drugs. Some homes employ unit dose clistribut:ion systems where each in\u00ad dividuul's dose is separately packaD'ed in cellophane or plastic and labeled with content, strength, and the patient's name. A 24-hour sup\u00ad ply is delivered to the nursing home by the pharmacist in a metal cabinet. Each patient has his own drawer in the cabinet which is divided in five sections to correspond with the home's medication h011rs. Indeliyerin~ the chart of medications the pharmacist picks up the one to be fillt::ct for the next day. Unfortunately, .the methods of drug distribution just mentioned are the exception and not the rule. In most U.S. nUl'sing homes, 30- day supplies of patient medications are stored in flo drug closet (gen\u00ad erally one per floor). Each patient may have from 4 to 10 different prescription bottles which are opened daily to remove the required dose. These individual doses are placed in small cups identified with cards bearing the patient's name. Thereafter, a typical medication tray with the medicutions of perhups 20 patients is bIren to bedside. Each patient is then given the pills in the small paper cup identified by the card bearing his name. Understandably, this system has been criticized as inefficient. For example, Richard Bermrm, president of the American Society of Consultunt Pharmacists, toH the subcom\u00ad mittee in 1971 : Documented time studies suggest that a 120-bed extended care or skilled facility with three 40-bed medication stations expends approximately 30 nursing hours per clay pouring, administering, charting, ordering, and auditing medication.14 Another witness described a typical home of 100 patients. He said that 500 to 600 individual prescriptions would be required at anyone time for the residents. He added : You know ,the standard procedure: Doctors prescribe the drugs needed by each pa,tlentand pharmacists reach into bulk containers of tablets or capsules and measure out a sr.ecific quantity, In:bel each bottle, note the charge, anclpos\u00ad slbly deliver it to the nursing center. Once .there, these hundreds of bottles cause tt. major storage and distribution problem. Each time a nurse prepares medications, she must reach into practicully every bottle, doling ont the right dose, making 811re that eueh patient gets the medication his doctor ordered.l~ U \"Ttcnds In Long-Term Cnre\", pnrt 17, bearings by the Subcommittee on Long-Term Cnr(>. U,S, Senate Speelnl Committee on Aging, p. 1708 . .. Page 1801, part lIT, bearings cited In footnote 14. 249 He also described an Indianapolis nursing center where: The (LVera~e number of doses per patient per day exceeded 14. Also, in t!la.t same facility, records of discontinued medica\u00ad tions documented the fact that in a 9-month period from September 1970 to June 1971, tke?'e aOCWJnll.tlatea more than 850 different presoription bottles oontaining over 1'7,000 doses of medioine, not oownting na'l\"ootios.16 (Emphasis added.) His testimony referred to a New York centtw where the nursing staff, ('observing strict professional techniques of drug preparation,\" spent 'an average of nearly 1 minute pel' dose for an avera,ge of nine doses per day per patient. The witness added: Ours and other studies corroborate the evidence that mul\u00ad ,tiple-dose prescription dispensing for the nursing center patient is dangerous, inefficient, and counterproductive to the efforts of conscientious pharmacy \u00b7and nursing personnel who are trying to upgrade the quality of care for the con\u00ad valescent patient.lf It should be obvious from the above that proper drug distribution is complicated and difficult in the best of circumstances even with trained persollJ1el. It should be clear that tIle responsibility for dis\u00ad pensing medications should be in the hands of onc who is trained, licensed, and fully cognizant of the possible adverse effects of medi\u00ad cations and capable of takin rr action to meet such problems. Unfortunately, all too often the management of drugs is left to untrained aides and orderlies, often hired literally off the street, in the words of one aide, seldom knowing the difference between \"an aspirin and a mothball.\" is For example, Bill Recktenwald, chief in\u00ad vestigator of the Better Government Association of Chicago, IlL, tes\u00b7 tified that he had applied for a job as a janitor and within minutes he was hired as a nurse with the key to the medications closet and narcotics cabinet on his belt. He said: The only thing I would say, Mr. Chairman, when I was working in homes, the persons distributing drugs were not trained in the distribution of them, and I myself was placed in ohm.'ge of distributing drugs to 3'7' patients, and I had no training, and in fact, when I had 'applied for the job, I indi\u00ad cated I had 6 years as a janitor. I saw bottles of drugs being passed by bottle from one pa\u00ad tient to another, using the nurses' ideas if the pills looked alike, to borrow some from one to the other.11l In addition, he told the subcommittee that he confirmed that a skid row hotel served as a contact point for recruiting nursing home order\u00ad lies. The operator of the hotel ('received a finders feu for sending these people out to the nursing home and one part of the deal was that they had to stay sober for 30 days before they got their first check.\" 11l\" 10 Puge lSl}l, purt 17, hearings 17 Puge lS()1, \u00b7part 17, in-A. bearings cited in footnotc 14. 19 Page 1456, part 15. bearings cited in footnote 14. 19.

I was given absolutely no training whatsoever in the pass\u00ad ing of medication; ho,,,ever, I did this on a, regular basis. Nurse's aides would also pass medications, and they did not have training in the effects of medications. An the nurses, nurse's aides, and orderlies had access to the narcotics cabi\u00ad net. It was very common when there were drugs left over from a patient who had left or had died to re-'-l.8e these drugs.20 Given the defects inherent intraditiona.l drug distribution sys\u00ad tems (as described above), the consequences to the nursing home pa\u00ad tient can be severe. II. CONSEQUENCES OF POORLY CONTROLLED DRUG DISTRIBUTION Faced with the widespread use of an inefficient and poorly con\u00ad trolled system of drug distribution, the infirm elderly are subjected to a wide variety of drug abuses. A. ERRORS IN MEDICATION ProvidinO' the right drug to the ri~ht patient at the right time C!U1 do mucll for the nursing home patlent's well-being. But the task is far. from easy, and the likelihood of error is high. Mistakes can occur III many ways: ! 1 The wrong drug. 2 The wrong dose. 3 'Wrong patient. 4: Wrong route .. ( 5 Missed dose. (6) ,\\Vrong time (2 or more hours berore or after scheduled time). Evidence of errors in medication goes back many yea,rs. The sub\u00ad committee's 1965 hearings are replete with references to medications commonly being administered by untrained individuals without physician's orders. For eXtHllple, one witness.said: A frequent violation is medication being administered by untrained persons without physician's signed order. I have been in homes where I have found patients in dmg stupors. The medical chart indicates the doctor hasn't been around for 4: 01' 5 months and hasn't ordered any medication 01' changed it in a long Hme.21 There are also references to poor recordkeeping where it is im\u00ad possible. ~o. tell if a medicaHon was ordered by a physician and if it was admullsterecl,22 There are numerous examples of drug error, waste and inefficiency. One witness, Dr. Roginsky, along with other doctors :0 Pnge 2278, pnrt lon, henrlngs cited In footnote 14. tt \"Conditions nnd Problems In the Nation's Nursing Homes\". part 3. hearings by th~. Subcommittee on Long-Term Cnr~. Los Angeles, Caltf., Feb, 17,1065, p. 243 . ., Page 41. pnrt 11, hearings dted In footnote 21. 251 in New York, voluntarily set up a review team to improve medicol conditions in several homes. He found some disturbing practices in his 1965 study: The doctor would come in, write the prescription down\u00ad stairs and spend 10 minutes to see 10 patients. I am sorry to say this, but frequently they would enter the nursing home and write prescriptions-in duplicate-without ever seeing the J?atients .... Patients receIving a drug for arthritis which is well known for its toxic effects had not once in a period of 3 to 6 months ... had a blood count or a urine analysis to determine whether there was any toxic effect of this particular drug. As you read in my statement, patients were receiving three to six different drugs without rhyme or reason.23 With close medical supervision, Dr. Roginsky and his team were able to reduce the volume of drugs supplied to the affected facilities by 25 pel'cent.24 Faced with the mounting complaints about nursing home pharma\u00ad ceutical practices, the subcommittee asked the U.S. General Account\u00ad ing Office to make an investigation. In 1966, the GAO conducted an 'audit of California nursing homes and found sizable amounts of drugs were being administered in 131'1'01'.25 In 1967, GAO reported that the State of Ohio paid for large quantities of drugs which often were never received by the patient.26 GAO said it was hindered by poor recol'clkeeping, making it impossible to tell how widespread such practices were. In 1970, GAO returned to California for a followup study which they entitled, \"Continuing Problems in Providing Nursing' Home Care and Prescribed Drugs Under the Medicaid Program in CaU:for\u00ad nia.\" 27 The results indicated stark :failures in drug administration. A review of 1 month's medical records of 106 medical patients at 14: ll\\ll:sin~ homes showed that 311 doses were administered in quantlties in excess o:f those prescribed and 1,210 prescribed doses were not administered. GAO auditors :found the same abuses in 1966, when they looked at nursing home care provided to California welfare recipients. Auditors ... made random selection of 36 welfare 'patients, 3 in each of the 12 nursing homes visited,and compared the nurses' records of medications and treatment \\for about a 3~ month period with the doctors' orders :for the patients. In 11 homes they found that the records indicated that 51 medica\u00ad tions involving 1,208 dosa~es were not administered at the frequency ordered by tlie doctors-',6 more dosages were administered than the order ordered by the doctors :for the time periods involved, and 1: 132 dosages ordered by the doctors were not recorded as having been admimstered to the patients. 28 ..

In 1970, the Nader Task Force on Nursing Home Problems also issued a report which said: ... Government statistics suggest widespread carelessness in the handling of drugs in nUl'Slll~ homes-drugs are admin\u00ad istered incorrectly or not at all, drugs prescribed by physi\u00ad ciansare allowed to continue too long, too many drugs are prescribed, or drugs are 'administered that 111we not been prescribed by a physician. Even more widespread is the prac\u00ad tice of keeping patIents under sedation to reduce the demands on the nursing staff.30 Since the Nadel' I'eport was issued in 1970 there has been in\u00ad creasing concern about the distribution of dI'UgS in nursing homes. More recent studies by schools of pharmacy have documented significant medication errors in nursing homes. In 1973, Dr. Allen M. K. Cheung, assistant professor of clinical pharmacy at the University of Southern California, documented a 21.83 percent rate of error in a statistically selected sample of four California nursing homes.s1 Dr. Cheung's still continuing study notes that even 'when nurses kne,,, the pharmacists would be looking over their shoulder, one 'Out of every five doses resulted in a medication error. A total of 2,505 doses were given with 547 errors. Fully one-half of the errors were missed medi\u00ad cations. The lowest error mte, 13.98 percent, occurred in the only fa\u00ad cility which had registered nurses on duty around the clock. \u00b7While the U.S.C. study is snrely the most significant of its kind, other stndies have documented even higher rates of error. The study of Professor Fred M. Eckel, University of Korth Carolina School of Pharmacy, is notable. He found a 69 percent rate of error nndlater !l 50 percent rate of error in the same sample. Most of the errors in his study were in the ((wrong time\" category; the largest part of the remainder were missed doses.32 After evaluating studies by Cheung, Eckel, and others Dr. Allan Kratz, president of the American SOCIety of Consultant Pharmacists, testified that \"the rate of errors for medications administered in long-term care facilities is from 20 to 50 percent.\" He charged fur\u00ad ther that 60 percent of the patients in llUl'sil1g homes received inade\u00ad quate pharmaceutical The Agony of One )[illion Amcricnns,\" Nn\u00a31l'r Task Force on Nursing HomeR. 1070, pp. 101-07. 31 Pnr:e 07, book cited DrllU Intclli\u00b7 that llul'sing home drugs are tl1- most totally without controls is pro\\'idt'<1 by a 1911 HEW,stnd\" of 'i5 ttmsing di'ubrS stiuly reported: -More than 30 percent of the patients had no rl'cordcd admission data, no transfer abstmct, no diagnosis, nor initial treatment orders-even though many of thenl were 011 digitalis and other potentially dangerolls <h'ugs. ~73 percent had admission history, of tllt' covered thnn blood pressure taken in over a :year; and for 25 percent of these' therl' was no diagnosis of: heart dIsease on tl\\(.~ ChtH't, -35 percent of the patients all tl'ttuquilbwrs had not had their blood pressure recorded In 11101'(' than a yelll'.

In each case, sworn testimony was taken. Much of that testimony dealt with ha'!'sh, and at times, outrageous realities which have 'also heen reported in media exposes elsewhere in the United States. (Sec Supporting Ptlpel' No.1 for more on the role of such journalistic inquiries.) Statements provided by nursing home emploYE'es, relativ('s and ot.h\u00ad ers are quoted here at. some length to provide the details of medication errol' which statistical studies cannot: From one patient's relat.ive, Mrs. Loretta Brown: On another occasion I had b('en visiting my cousins when a person who worked at the nursing home 'came into the room and told Nancy to take her medicine. Nancy knew that she did not take medicine at that hour and told tl1e woman so. Nancy was alert and knew what medicines she WI~S supposed to get. T couldn't help wondering how many times this hal)penS at this home and what happens to the patient who is too confused to know what is going on.38 From licensed practica.1 nUl'se Kay Schal1bcl'g' : There were two floors at this builclinf( and I worked the 2nd floor. On llW shift, an aide would work the 1st floor and had the key for the medications. This a.ide wonlcl set up the medica\u00ad tions and J)assthem, and then would set up the medications for the morning shift. She had no Nursing Supervisor over her at thnt time. She also had no training and knew nothing about tIl(', reactions of the dru/!s she was administel'in!!. Often times when I would come on there was a Registered Nurse by the llnme of Mrs .... who would ten me Ilbout oyerdosages or medicines that had not been m'escrib('cl that. she had given to various patients. She told me to wfltch them. She never charted anI' of tIllS information however. This nurse would also delib\u00ad erately increase the dosage. of a sedative much higher than the prMcription in order to (luiet down natients. but then she wonld P11t on the chart that she had administered the required d()~ap'e. She would take sNlu.t.;ves from the, pl'('scl'intions Ot other patients in order to do this. One time on t.he afternoon In footnotl' 14, 255 shift before I came on, apparently a new aide who had no experience and did not know the floor at all was just given the medications to distribute. 'She, not knowing what to do exa~tly, went through room by I'oom just passing out the mecli\u00ad catIOns as she went, and when she was through she was out of medications but there was still one room left. Therefore, when I came on I was told to keep an eye on an the patients in all the rooms in case there were any rellctions to mIXed up drugs that night. None of this was ever put on the charts.lIo On the question of patients missing their medication, nurse's aide Lormine Kippe]s testified with respect to a patient that jumped out of a third story window to her death: Mrs .... had bN'n on that floor for n number of days when one day when we came on work, we, overheard a nurse, Mrs. O~rl'Y, say that Mrs. . . . was a diabetic. We were very sur\u00ad prIsed because no one had ever told us that she was diabetic. ,:'/e had no cards, 110 orders, and no medications for her as a diabetic. As it turned out, she was one of the worst dir.betics that they had in the. whole building, but they never told us abont it. Yet we were the ones who were supposed to be taking c[\\,re. of her. We looked at her medication charts and ther(', were no medications ordered for her.40 Order1y Robert Shypulski testified: There is one incident that I would like to bring out, because I was caned as a witness to it. There was rm LPN named Mrs. Bruckner who worked from 7' am to 3 :30 pm. One day Mrs. De Mars noticed that there were three trays of medica\u00ad tions that had been dumped into a wastebasket. Mrs. Brnck\u00ad ner had dumped them in the wastebasket. Mrs. De Mars called me as a witness. They put all the medication in a bag and called Mrs. O'Connell [the head nmse]. The next day Mrs. Bruclmer told Mrs. O'Connell that she had not \"passed the medications because she did not feel that she should chase after an the patients. She didn't \u00a3eel there was any sense ill it. Mrs. O'Connell thought that was a goocl excuse. Some people pass out medications and just put them on the food trays. The kitc11en reports that the medications come. back to the kitchen.41 Nurse's aide Glayds Danielson stated: There is a constant problem with the giving out of medi\u00ad cines, There is an aide. \u00b7who has 110 nUl'sing training who oc\u00ad casionally gives insulin injections. On one occasion she gave one diabetic patient an injection of insulin in the morning and did not mark it up in 'the day book. Later that morning an L.P.N. gave her another injection, and I had to feed her sweets all dil.Y long. Medications are often set up by aides, only occasioMlly by RN.'s. They make mistakes often. They mix up the pills or Png~s 2~34-35. part lOB. 11lB. hc>nrlngs cited In footnote 14. 256 leave some out, and the aides do not check to be sure the pills are taken. Many times my sister has found pills of my mother's on the floor at night.42 In summary, the flow of drugs through most of America's 23,000 nursing homes is almost totally without controls; it is haphazard, inefficient, costly, and, most of all, dangerous to the patients who must trust others 'for their protection. The foregoing facts demonstrate the frightening conclusion that 20 to 40 percent of the drugs administered in U.S. nursing homes al'e administered in enol'. Unfortunately, medication . error is only part of the problem. B. THEFT AND MISUSE The poorly controlled drug distribution system in nursing homes provides an open and tempting opportunity for numerous abuses. The subcommittee has documented severall'xamples of the following illegal practices: -Use of medications of discharged patients. -Use of medicntions of dead patients. -Theft of drugs for personal use or gain. -Theft or borrowing from one patient's supply to serve another patient. As previously described, it is difficult enough to administer drugs accurately to patients from their own clearly marked supplies. When medications are borrowed, or obtained from supplies saved from dis\u00ad charged or dead patients, the possibilities for medieation error multi\u00ad ply. There is the added danger of medications decomposing and be- coming ineffectual or dangerous if kept too long. Keeping the unused drugs of patients who have left the nursing home also provides ample opportunity for monetary gain. Nursing home owners can agree to return unilsed supplies to the pharmacist for mutual profit. Examples of this practice have been reported to the sub\u00ad committee.41l This available \"pool\" of unused medications can be used to provide doses to patients who are then charged for the drug, even though the nursing home paid for nothing. It also affords the home a ready supply of sleeping pills and tranquilizers which they could administer to patients without a prescription. There are some who are sympathetic to the reuse of drugs. Their argument is generally structured in terms of preventing waste and inefficiency. Several studies have indicated that such drug waste can . amount to as much as 15 percent of the nursing homes total drug bill.44 In two senarate studies, phal'rnacists .Tohn Rn,wlings and Donald R Mathieson have found the drug waste clue to death, transfer, release, u Png(' 2242, pnrt lnB. henrlngs cited In footnote of orderly used for otlll'r 1I11t1ents.

Testimony before the subcommittee estimated this loss more conservatively at $12 to $15 million.40 What these figures illustrate is the inefficiency of the traditional dis\u00ad tribution system, bttt they oannot, and 87w~tld not, be useel to justify the accumulation of a private pool of pharmaceuticals from which nursing home personnel can prescribe on their own initiative. Drug theft in nursing homes has primarily two serious results: (1) The cost of nursing home care increases (and the American tax dol\u00ad lar must pay more for Medicaid and Medicare), and (2) the poten\u00ad tial supply of drugs to illicit markets is greatly increased. The U.S. Bureau of Narcotics nnd Dangerous Drugs estimates that 90 percent of the dangerous drugs in the illicit market are diverted, intentionally, or unintentionally, from licensed sources.41 Opporttmi\u00ad bies for diversion appeal' to be endless and nursing homes can provide all illviting target. While theft of narcotics is not unheard of in nursing homesj the primary targets for theft are amphetamines and barbiturates: With the development of the drug culture in our society, drug control problems have shifted from the narcotics and medications with high alcoholic content to the amphetamines and other stimulants) and to both the ibarbiturates and non\u00ad barbiturate sedatives. To a lesser degree, tranquilizers and the newer synthetic analgesics are now sought by those who experiment with and use drugs.48 Congress passed, in 1965, the Federal Drug Abuse Control Amend\u00ad ments (known as the Harris Ln;w)40 in an attempt to curb the illicit distribution of amphetamines and barbiturates. Commenting on this law, the July 1966 edition of NU'f'8ing Horne magazine :reported its concern about possible diversion of nursing home drugs: The immediate effect willl'esuitin more drugstore break\u00ad ins I1nd more addicts seeking loosely controlled outlets, such as nursing homes for their source of supply. ~o Medicare and Medicaid regulations 51 require that narcotics, barbi\u00ad turates, amphetamines, und other dangerous drugs be kept under \"double\" lock in nursing homes. In other words, these drugs must be kept in a separately locked, securely fastened box or drawer within the medications cabinet (01' room) which is also locked. Unfortu\u00ad nately, this regulation is often ignored and poorly enforced. In far See source cited In footnote 44.

Once again, the full flavor of abuse (this time, of drug theft and misuse) can best be provided by testimony and sworn statements. Here 'are some examples: One nurse, 1\\\u00a3rs. Kay 1\\\u00a3. Schallberg, reported open access to nar\u00ad cotics, and flagrant examples of employee theft: I was the only nurse on a,t night, and all the staff at this ' home had keys to the medicine room !tnd to the narcotics cabinet. The medioations room was never locked, All t.h~ aides had keys to tIlls room. They never kept count of the narcotics in this home. They would borrow one narcotic prescription to repln.ce another, and then they would never replace the one they borrowed from. (t\"ontral'Y to what law requires, this home did not destroy medications that belonged to patients, who died. They kept them in a special cabinet. There were aides who stole medications and food at this home. Two of these aides worked on my shift. One of them had an invalid husba.nd at home who took a lot of drugs. I actually saw them take food and medications to pnt in their cars at night to take home. I reported this to 1\\\u00a3rs. Bartley but she said to let it go this time. The second t.ime I saw it happen an aide and I went out and asked if we could look throug-h their ca.r; they refused to let. me. One of these aides was fired, the other still works there. They both had kevs to the medications l'oom and to the na,rcotics c,abinet and they just helped them\u00ad selves to what they needed.n From another nurse, 1\\\u00a3rs.

Sta.ff 14. 259 Mrs. Lola Finney, a nurse's aide from the same home stated: What was supposed to happen as \u00a3ar as narcotics were con\u00ad cerned, was that the nurses were supposed .to come upstairs and set up the narcotics and barbituates. Then we were SUll\u00ad posed to pass them out. Of course no one could renlly check any of the aides in case they wanted to pocket some of the narcotics. We didn't get that kind or supervision. 'We also had the key to the narcotics cabinet all the time. It would htwe been very ensy to steal narcotics. If you wanted to steal nar\u00ad cotics you wouldn't go to the tlltrcotics cabinet. It was much easier to slip them into your pocket instead of giving them to the patient and then tell the nurse that the patient took them. Mrs. o?Conllell [the head llurse] at times would ask me to open up the narcotics cabinet and set them up when the nurse wasn't Itvailable. Anybody who had a key to the Medi\u00ad cations Room had access to the narcotics cabinet and !l. lot of people had keys to thnt room. There were a number of times when narcotics were missing. OM day we wero informed that a whole bottle of Seconal tanlets was missing on the 2nd floot.oO About. the same llOme, Mrs. Lorraine ICippels. also a nurse's aide, ex-plained the procedure \u00a301' \"borrowing') medications: I was also told by Mrs. O'Connell [the head nurse] it I ran out of medications that she had some in her office. I have gone down to her office, she has opened the drnwer and given me medications out of her desk drawer. There were medications from patients that had expired or lmd left the home. There were also salves from other patients in this drawer. We were also told if we had to borrow medications, to borrow from the welfare po.tients.~6 As these examples illustratet a poorly controlled system of drug distribution in a nUrgitlg' home can provide numerouS opportunities for theft and mistise of drugs. As long as this kind of haphazard approach is permitted. and as long as untrained aides and ol'derlies are given the responsibility for passing medications, these abuses will continue. C. THE HIGH INCIDENCE OF ADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS A few years ago, Dr. Margaret Mead sounded a warning in testi\u00ad mony before a Scnn.te subcommittee: We should be thinking about the tremendous health hazards of mixtures of drugs, of drugs that are administered in ignoranc.e of the idiosyncrasies of the patient, of drugs that Me ndministered in ignorance of the foods that are incom\u00ad patible with them.or This admonition 1,118 become all the more important in recent years. More and more physicians and ph;1irmncist..c; are turning their aUen- .. bellrlngs Monopol,.

Fot' thes(~ reas'ons, what should be a standard dose of medication tor It l11iddh~ .. agedadu]t, might wen be an overdose in an older person. MOl'eover, seientists have documented greatel' yariability in response to (h'ugs taken by the elderly. Results are not always as predictable in seniors. Similarly, the number and frequency of interactions and side effeets fo)' most drugs increase sharply with age. Edward S. Brady, associate dean, school of pharmacy, University of Southern Oalifornia, w)'ote: The usual aetion of cert.ldn drugs may be influenced by chronic disease stn:tus of oWer people. Hence, usual dosages might not be appropriate to this age group. For instance, in caSeR of impaired kidney function, the patient might not be able to ('xcrete drugs froin his system as rapidly as he should. 01', certain enzyme systems of the olc1er person's body, affect ell by the slowdowns of p,gil1g', (\\11.11 grently influence the l'(~s\\l1ts of drugs. 58 All of thr.se problems are amplified when patients receive t.wo or 111 Ot'e, drugs. The medical and pharmaceutical communit.y is just be\u00ad ginning to learn 'that two drugs taken at. the same time may nullify (,{tcll other 01' produce harsh or une,xpectecll'esults. In some cases, one chug will potentiate another (t.hey interaet with each otl~er), so that the effect. of the total is greater than tIl('. sum of the mdependent effects or either of t;he two substances taken individually. ObyiollSly, t11e mOre drugs takenn.t the same, time the higher the clmllces or nn adverse reaction.

The patients have an average age of 82 and take from five to seven different drugs each day, some tal{en two amI three times a day.oo Some patients talm 20 or mOl'e drug's in the course of a month. Often, these drugs are taI{en for long periods of time. Finally, nursing homes have comparatively few licensed nurses (80,000) out of their over 500,000 employees. Un\u00ad licensed uer.\u00a7onnel, aides and orderlies, are for the most pal\u00b7t untrailH\\tl a~\\d unable to identify adverse l'eactions or side effects. There nrc 5011ie \\,\"xamples of common drug int.eractions: A most common interaction OCCUl'S between digitalis (Il heart stim ulnnt) und various kinds of diuretics (drugs increasing the output of mine).

Now, the central question is': does the patient need all of these drugs? Is t.here any WRy we can reduce the number of drugS to minimize particular side effects? 70 Tho dangers inherent are all the more apparent aiter a quick look at the classes of drugs most commonly received by nursing home pa\u00ad tients and their possible effects. The following excerpts are taken from the American Medical Association Drug Evaluation Guide. As indi\u00ad co.ted, adverse reactions may be as mild as a headache or nausea, or as serious as convulsions of extracellulal' fluid in order to elimmate edema (excessive accumulation of fluids) 01' prevent its developing. Adverse reaction may be either mild or dangerous: from headacnes and nausea to dehydration SE(,ONArJ, N E?!IBU'l'AL, CHLORAlJ H YDRA'l'l~S) When administered by day, and in small doses, sedatives may reduce emotional tension; in largor doses they induce sleep. Patients taking these drugs may show signs of lethargy. Prolonged use can lead to addiction, which the AMA drug guide notes \"is more destructive to personalit.y than narcotic dependence.\" Overdoses can result in death. Other drugs taken at the same time will increase the potency of seda\u00ad tives, among these are to suppress less severe manifGstations of anxit>ty and tension. Adverse effects mH.y include dizziness, impaired memory and judgment. Some patients evidence paradoxical reactions; ruther t.han becoming quiet, the disturbed patient becomes more violent. Addiction may result from the prolonged use of such a.gents and withdrawal symptoms may be severe (delirium and convulsions) when the drugs are terminated.73 AN'l'Il'SYCHO'l'IG AGENTS (ExA1\\rpu~s: THORAZINE, MELLAmL, SPARINE) These drugs are useful in the treatment of acute and chronic psychosis. Ethical practice limits their use to relieve symptoms of m~nta.l illness or to alleviate delirium in individua.ls when antiaJlxiety agents have failed. . 70 Pnge 12. book cited In footnote 3, 11 Page 43. hook clte!lln footnote Gti, ..

These drugs may ~ro\u00ad c1uce Parkinsonian syndrome (tremors, shuffling gait, excessive sahva\u00ad tion, faces) ; they may produce tardIve dyskinesia, charac\u00ad terized by rhythmic movements of the tongue, jaw, and face which persist even after the drug is discontinued. These drugs should be gi ven with great cal'e to heart patients hecause they may cause a\\'\\'hythmias of the heart (erratic heartbeat), myocardlal infarction (a type of heart attack) !1lHl death. The AMA guide notes that the elderly are pal'ticular!y susceptible to the detrimental side effects of alltipsychotir; agents. Good medical practice requires that their use be strictly time-limited and episodic, and that they be used as an adjunct to getting at the cause of the patient's agitation.74 L('tt(,l'S snch as the following provide additional information: Hon.

In shori, drugs have the potential fur harm as well as for O'ood. Theil' use needs to be cu,refully controlled and managed. The elderly, and particularly those innursin~ homes, present speCIal problems. Be\u00ad cause of the large number of different drugs taken over protracted 265 periods of time and the lack of personnel trained to deal with un\u00ad toward effects, thousands of patients in long-term institutions are prime candidates for adverse reactions. The full effect of this problem has yet to be determined in nursing homes but hospital studies provide this lesson: Despite strict hospital controls and the presence of trained personnel, 15 to 30 percent of patients have one or more drug reactions during hospitalization. Dl'Ug misadventures cause a total of 30,000 deaths annually, and the cost of drug induced hospitalization approxi\u00ad mates $3 billion ayear.70 D. DRUG ADDICTION AMONG\u00b7 NURSING HOME PATIENTS , ~. Most nursing home patients receive drugs over a protracted period of time, sometImes months and years. If a patient is taking narcotics, sedatives, antidepressants, or tranquilizers, there is a good l)ossibility of his developing a.ddiction. The more technical name I01' aadiction is psychic or phySIcal dependence on drugs. Such \"dependence\" or \"ad\u00ad diction\" is characterized by withdrawal symptoms (when the drug is taken away) which can be moderate to severe. In some cases, removal from a drug can cause delirium and convulsions. There are occasion!!'l references in the subcommittee's hearings to the problem of drug addiction amon~ the elderly in nursing homes. E. C. Morris, executive director, Planned Action for Commmlity Elderly, Des Moines, Iowa, testified: If I could have my files here and show you documented files-giving you as one example a man who was 94 years old, whose wife was 92. These two people were in our Yocal hos\u00ad pital, under Medicare .... Now, I am a former administra\u00ad tor of Medicare in the Public Health Service. I ]mowa little somethinO' about it. The lady passed away 3 days after I was appointed' by the courts as their guardian conservator. vVe removed the gentleman; put him in a nursing home, and in 4 months' time this man's drug bill went from $20 to $104-$104 a month for drugs. We put him in another local nursing home-and for 3 weeks this man had to be held in restraint for drug removal. Today, I pay anywhere from $16 to $18 a month for his drugsY There is 110 question that many of the drugs cOlTunonly administered in nursing homes have, at least, the potential of addiction as an adverse side effect (see chart 011 page 2(4). One doctor, who is also the executive director ofa nursing home, has written: Many of these elderly people are dependent, if not truly addicted, 011 the medicatlOns that they are taking; this is easily verified by observing the patient when the doctor sug\u00ad gests disCOlltinU1l10' medications . . . . \"\"Ye inform the elderly applicant prior to their arrival at the home that ... we 'want to see how these old people fare without the ingestion of their multitudinous drugs ... This 7. Pnge 1, book cited In footnote 3. '11 \"Evnluntion of.

(Emphasis added.) Our clients really do seem to flourish .... I.think that's why we are one of the few homes for the aged which actually does gmduate some of its residents back to society after they have been \"dried out\" for several mouths, or perhaps a year.78 While the suspicion lingers that addiction among elderly nUl'sing home patients is more frequent tlUtU anyone would care to imagine (because of the huge volume of drugs with addictive potential taken by uursing home patients for protracted periods of time), there is little hard evidence. 'Without doubt4 the problem of addiction to drugs among nursing home patients lleecls much more attention than it is receiving today. Perhaps part of the reason this quest.ion has not been brought into sharper focus is the attitude o:f some. professionals. The Nader Task Force report stated: One California physician, when told of an elderly lady's addiction to a painkiller Percodan replied: \"She is an old lacly, let her enjoy it.\" 70 Examples of addiction in the elderly raise serious moral and ethical questions which should be faced head on and should not be swept under the rug of complacency. E. DRUG EXPERIMENTS IN 1TURSING HOMES In the normal course of developing llew drugs, some experimenta\u00ad tion with human beings is required. It is not Ullcommon for this type of experimentation to take place in nursing homes. The nursing home atmosphere provides many advantages for this type of experimentation. Some of the advantages include: (1) The afflictions and infirmities which drugs are supposed to cure or treat abolUld in such facilities. (2) Patients tend to be long-term so that results can be carefully monitored. (3) Experimental variables can be more easily controlled. 'resting of investigational drugs in nursing homes should not nec\u00ad essarily be discouraged (especially if such testing will lead sig11ificallt ad vallces in understanding the effects of drugs on the elderly). How\u00ad eyer, experimentation in nursing homes should be permitted only lUlder the strictest of controls. Nursing home residents are powerless and must look to others for their protection. Many cannot make their own decisions and in fact, a third or more of today's million llursing home patients ha.ve no relatives to assist them. Morc impOltantly, drug com\u00ad panies and others are aware of poorly controlled system of drug dis\u00ad tribution innUl'sing homes. This atmosphere is inyiting to drug manu\u00ad facturers, who are anxious to complete tests for new drugs with a mini\u00ad llltull of inrorference Ol' delay. The subcommittee has great misgivings about the absence of existing safeguards with respect to investigations generally and specifically 78 Puge U4. book cited In footnote 3 .... Puge 101, report c\\t\".1. In footnote 30. 267 in nursing homes. There are some 6,000 so-called investi~ational drugs being tested today.so Under the Food and Drug Actministration's (FDA) rules, a company is free to begin tests in humans subject to FDA veto, 30 days after notifying the agency of its intention. In prac\u00ad tice, the FDA permits clinical testing to begin in humans after only 2 weeks of animal studies-and before those animal studies have been evaluated. These facts and others came to light in a Sl'.ptem:ber 1973 report by the General Accolmting Office which charged that the FDA had failed in its efforts to protect patients in whom medications were being tested for safety and effectiveness. Senator Abraham Ribicoff who released the report, charged that pharmaceutical companies had failed to estab\u00ad lish sare testing procedures and had resisted FDA regulation.s1 The GAO provided startling examples where several pharmaceuti\u00ad cal companies had :failed to notify the FDA after learning that people were exposed to drugs which caused adverse reactiolls in animals. Time lags in giving FDA crucial data ranged from 1 month. to a year and a half. In one case, Ayerest Laboratories waited 19 months be\u00ad tween the completion of a British study showing possible cancer in mice given its ex:pe,rimcntal drug Pronetholol and submission of the study til> the FDA. In another cnse, GAO charged that the company had refused to inform the doctors conductinll' the tests in humans, of tests showing cancerous tumors ill animals. Ayerest also disl'eg;t,l'ded three FDA orders to halt testing of its experimental drug, Practu!~l. In yet another case, E. R. Squibb and Sons halted tests on 324 patients receivin~ Oinanserin (once described by a Squibb executive as a dl.'ug looking lor a condition to treat), after liver tumors developed in long\u00ad term tests with rats, but Squibb refused to undertake patlent follow\u00ad Up.S2 The GAO study has relevance in the nursing home context as well. The subcommittee has received severa] complaints charg\u00ad ing improper controls. Most of these involved the question of \"informed consent\": Was the patient capable of understanding the situation and did he knowingly give permission? One case received bd; the subcommittee involved the dru\u00a5 \"Anavar\" (developed by G. D. \",sal'le and Co.) in which the patients informed consent was established by 'an \"X\" on the consent statement.S3 Ralph Nader and hi!: Task Force on Nursing Homes investigated the case in 'some detail. Testifying before the subcommittee in Decem\u00ad ber of 1970 they said: Drug companies frequently carry out experimental drug research 011 nursing home patients. One woman's report of an experiment involvmg her mother is a striking e~ample of the opportunities for anuse that can occur. The case is unusual onl)7 in thn,t the family of the plttient made exhaustive inquir\u00ad ies following her del1th and fmmd that no one-the Govern\u00ad ment, the attending physician, or the home-wns adequately protecting the patient. eo \"R1blcolr Rlts FDA Laxity in Rumlln Testing Post, September 24, lOnl, p, 48; sec also Control Seen In Drug Testing,\" NCIO York Ti/tlC8, 1975, p, 20. \"' lOJee articles cltellln tootnote SO, 80 Sec articles cited In tootnote 80. Ia In subcommittee flIes. 268 Unknown to the family (the daughter had expressly told the attending physician not to '!tUow her mother to be given ex\u00ad perimental drugs) , the nursing home and attending physician approved the patient, among others, for the experiment. The patient's \"consent\" was gained; she marked an X on a consent statement. After taking the, drug for about 6 months, the patient be\u00ad came critically m. Mellical diagnosis never confirmed the cause of the illness; no move was made to find out whether the experimental drug had caused or contribut.ed to the illness; the drug continued to be given. Two months later, the woman died. Roth the home and the coroner who filled out the death certificat(' refused to tell the family exactly how or why the woman died. The home has re\u00ad fused to release the woman's meQi(,ml records to 'her family. The family did obtain a record of the drugs given the pa\u00ad tient '!tnd discov('!'ed that she was taking an experiment'al drug. When they demanded to know why they had not been consulted, the home produced a \"consent\" document marked with the pat,ient's X. The patient had been judged senile by her doctor who r('commended that sl1\\\\1 live in an institution. Nonetheless, the home maintained and the FDA concurred, that the \"consent\" of 'a person medically diagnosed as senile was sufficient. The family further discovered that the woman's doctor be\u00ad lieveq the drug was given as already approved and not as an experImental drug. He, therefore, made 110 attempt to see whether the drug was having ill effects on the patient. In this case, according to the daughter, cel'tainallel'gies and an edema condition made it possible that the drug could have been highly dangerous for her mother.84 'rhe Anavar example points out clearly the need for the FDA to exercise particular vigilance in the case of drug experimentation with nursing home patients. The FDA should require a strict stand\u00ad ard of consent where the infirlU elderly are involved and pharmaceu\u00ad tical companies should be held accountable for the well being of these patients. F. THE \"OHEMICAL STRAIGHT .rAOKET\" Perhaps the most common and most devastating consequence of present inefficient drup: distribution syst('ms is the ovcruse-of tran\u00ad quilizers. Tranquilizers p:o by many \u00b7names. Those most nursing homes are caneel psychotropic drugs 01' antipsychoti'c ap:ents; sometimes chemical namc, phenothiazines, or butyrophenones. Theil' proper use is to modify psychotic symptoms (mental illness) for purposes of d('creasinp: aggressive or o'vel'active behavior. . The report of the Nadel' Task Force Oil N1ll'sing Homes charged that tranquilizers were given to patients largely for staff cOlwenience. They testified: . 81 Poge 892, port II. heorln!;s cited In footnote 14. 269 In perhaps 50 percent of the letters we received there was mention of patients being put under sedation for no other reason than to sImply keep them quiet and out of trouble.85 This charge should not be surprising in view of claims made by manufacturers on behalf of such products. For example, Sandoz Pharmaceuticals, in their advertisements for the tranquilizer Mellaril, claims that the \"far-retwhing') effects of this drug will benefit the stn,ff who will \"find their work load greatly lightened as patient demands are replaced by a spirit of self-help and self-interest.\" so In 1970, Nelson Cruikshank, president of the National Council of Senior Oitizens, culled upon Oongress to investigate the \"dangerous use of tranquilizer drugs on elderly nursing home patients simply to pacify them.\" He said: Excessive use of tranquilizers can quickly reduce an ambulatory pntient to a zombie, confining the patient to a chair or bed, causing the patient's muscles to atrophy from inaction and causing general health to deteriorate quickly. Conscientious doctors may use t1'!lnqllilizer drugs in a care\u00ad fully administered. program to help genuinely disturbed patients. However, It appeal'S that many doctors, who are less than conscientious, give blanket instructions to llursing home stafrs for the use of tranquilizer drugs on patients who do not need them.57 In response, Senator Moss asked for a full investigllition of the use of tranquilizers in nursin~ homes. He requested an audit by the U.S. General Accounting Office (described previously) 88 which was released at the subcommittee's September 1971 hearing in Chicago, Ill. This audit confirmed beyond any doubt that enormous u.mounts of tranquilizers ftow into U.S. llursing homes each year. Painkillers, tranquilizers, and sedati yes accountecf for almost 40 $120 mlllion of the N ation's $300 mi1lion nursing home drug bill. Tran\u00ad quilizers t,hemselves made up almost 20 percent of these drugs for a total of $60 million a year. It is worth restating that 10 percent of the total nursing home drug bill (or $30 million a yeal') goes to pay for the two strongest tranquilizers available, Thorazine and MelIttri!. Expressed in different terms, $60 million spent for nursing home t.ranquilizers each year works Qut to an average of $60 pel' patient pel' year for tranquilizers. Thel'e nre certainly many legitimate uses of tranquilizers, but tIll.' sheer volume that has been cloctunented creates at lenst the inference that some are given without pI'oper cOllt.rols.80 ,Villiam R. Hutton, executhre director of the National Council of Seni01' Citizens, testifying at the Ohicago hearing, charged that. the overuse of tranquilizers is more fact than inference, and provided several examples: It is the firm belief of the N ationnl Council of Senior Oiti\u00ad zens, based on letters and phone calls from members and the public, that the unwarranted use of tranquilizer drugs in s.'

AlJrll 26. 1072. 270 nursing homes is far more widespread than has been genemlly realized. Below are some recent complaints to the National Council of Senior CItizens headquarters regarding abuse of tranquil\u00ad izer drugs in nursing homes across the United States. -Mrs . r., Syosset, N.Y.-My brother-he's 63-had a an ar111 and leg. I looked triter him a while and he was alwu.ys bright and eheedul. Finally, he en\u00ad tered a nursing home, and, whenever I go to see him, he's either sleeping or acts half-asleep. I suspect they give him drugs to make him sleep a lot. -Mr. T., Kansas Oity, Mo.-My mother is in a nursing home because sl1('. broke lier hip Itllc111eec1s speeial care. IrNtlizc it's hard for her to get arouncl but she acts like she's half dead. She tells me the medicine they give her makes her that way. -Mrs.' L., Los Angeles, C'alif.-I would like to do S01111;'\u00ad thing to help my mothN' who is '73. She, has arthritis and has had to go to a nnrsing home. Ever since s111;' went there, she arts like she's dopl;'d and I am afl,ttid they !{(~I;'p he,1' that 'way becallse then she doesn't need so much loolnng after. Positive treatment leading to rehabilitation and the pa\u00ad tient's return to the maiIistream of society should be tIl(' goal of the nursing home. If the nursing home pntient rl;'ceives little or no positiVI;'. remedial care but instead is kept in a comatose state with tmnquilizer drugs, this makes the nursing home a warehouse for the dying. 00 . At the same hearing, Senator Cllfi.rles Percy pointed out that bed\u00ad bound patients bring the highest rate of rl;'imbnrsement under the l1linois public assistance program. He e-:lI.\"plained the operation of the Illinois system to the British expert, Dr. Lionel Z. Cosin. In Illinois, each individual patient is assigned points on the basis of his disabili\u00ad ties. Each point is worth $6; the more points t.he greater the monthly reimbursement to the nursing home. Patients left sitting in their own waste who become bellieQse can be labeled \"behavior problems\" which is worth 8 points at $6 n. point or $48 more pel' month to the operator. Behavior problems require daily injections of a tranquilizer such as Thorazine which is n,nother 6 pOints or $36 more per month. Patients taking In,rge quantities of tl'lLnquilizers run a high risk of developing bedsores which are Itlso worth 8 points or another $48 more a. month to the. operator. SellittOI' Percy concluded: \" ... There is an incentiv~ to keep pn,tients in bed rather than get them out and rehn,bilita.te them.\" 01 Dr. Cosin responded: \"I can't agree with you more, Senator. I think there is n, gross overuse of dru{{s. I thiilk L1t...,l'~ i8 n iannre on the pa.rt of internal medicine to identify problems which result in dis\u00ad turbed beha.viol' in elderly patients.\" He continued, suggesting t,hat with PI'OP('l' diet and environment, t.he disturbed pat.ient can be calmed down. He noted the deterioration of patients exposed to t.ranquilizers adding: \"In fact, I think there is a good case for giving tranquilizers to the staff anclleaving patients alone.\" 02 00 footnote 14. 02 Pnge 1388, pnrt 14, henrlng8 cIted In footnote H. 271 T:rm IN])US'l'UY RESPONSE A stern rebuttal to the charges made at the Ohicago hearing was provided by A. B, Magnus Jr., ndministrator of the Magnus Farm in Arlington Heights, Ill. Mr. Magnus-writing in the March 1972 issue of NU1'sing Homes, the official publication of the American Nursing Home Association, said that it was \"astounding\" that snch assertions could be made on \"hearsay\" evidence. He argued: The use of tranquilizers us \"chemical strn1tjuckets\" to make more money for the owners could not -occur for two principal reasons. The first is that the practice would <be counterproductive, i.e., it would actually increase operating costs; and second it would involve the participrution of too many licensed professionals. Unauthorized use of tranquiliz\u00ad ers, and all ethieal ch'ngs is a criminal act, Adequate l<:'gal safeguards exist.03 He also questioned whether' \"people representing at least five li\u00ad censed health care professions would be party to a conspiraey 01' remain silent in the face of such an ,obvious situation as an institution full of ch'ugged or semiconscious patients.\" O~ Still the question remains: Are tranquilizers being administered to mal{e it easier all tlle staff? l'ho dlLta assembled by the subcommittee suggests the answer is affirmative. Given the shot\"tcomings in control of nursing home drugs and the fact that unlicensed and untrained personncl1uwe wiele access to nursing 1101110 (h'ugs, it could IHLl'dly be otherwise. The pl'<:'s(>nt system of drug distribution provides Ii ren,dy supply of all ch'ugs, tmnquilizcl's in particular, which are paid for by the Government. Nlll'Smg personnel ttre not adverse, to borrowing drugs Trom one patient for another. Neither physicians nor l'egistel'ed nurses are present in sufTicicmt numbers to prevent this pl'actice. In Ol'del'to accmnulate more precise data on this question, the sub\u00ad committee structured its November 1971 hearings in M'hmesota with the aid of the Minneapolis Age and Opportunity Center (l\\LA.O.), The hl'arings was based on over 50 sworn affidavits from nursing home personnel, prepared by the legal staff of M.A.O. l'he subcom\u00ad mittee hearings proved concillsh\u00b7ely thnt unlicensed aides order\u00ad lies have l'l'ady access to the medications Imd narcotics in mauy nurs\u00ad ing homes. Nursing home pel'solllll'l in their testimony, reported in\u00ad discriminate tranquilization of patients to keep them quiet. 'rhe fol- 10:ving Frol11llurse's aide Barham I~ace is n hl:'avy use of tranquiHzCl.'s on OUl.' Hoor. Woo had a discussion nbout this onco and I got. kind of nngl'y and told the umse. There hlty~ been times when they woke the patients in DO \"Arc Trmlqulllzcrs Sec nrUc1e In footnote 93. 272 order to give them tranquilizers so that the patients would stay out of their hair. By keeping the patient.s drugged up, they are being turned into vegetables. Many of these patients are having psychological problems that are not beiuO' treated. They are medioated so that we don't have to deal with them.UG From licensed practical nmse Kay SchnJlberg: This nurse would also deliberately increase the dosage of a sedative much higher than the prescription in order to quiet down patients, but then she would put on the chart that she had administered the reguired dosage. She would take seda\u00ad tives from the pl'escripitlOns of other patients in order to do this.oB From orderly Robert Shypulski : Tranquilizers are used for everything. X was great for using tranquilizers. If you moved a muscle you got it. You could have dropped some of these people off of the build\u00ad ing and t.hey wouldn't have blinked their eyes. It doesn't phase them anymore. 1Ve either posey (restram) them or let ,them walk.01 In presenting this information to th<.> subcommittee, Mt\u00b7s. Daphne executive her 6-year lnvestign,tion of nursing; homes in Minnesota, testifying, from her experience;'tha.t indiscriminate tranquilization was common practice. She said: nurse's aide, tranquilizers am a hap\u00ad py solution. If patients are sedated, they cause the staff few problems. The administrator is IHtPPy, too, because bedbound pat.ients bring the highest rate of reimbursement.os The specter of unlicensed aides and orderlies prescribing tran\u00ad quilizers on their own. initiative is nothing short of hair-raising. Unfortunately, existing Feclerall'egulations implicitly, if not directly, sanction the practice. Present Federal standards no longer restrict drug distribution in nursing homes to licensed personnel, as was the Medicarl'-Medicaid standard until January 1974. The decision to allow unlicensed p<.>rsonnel to set up and pass medications was made by HE\"r as part of their unification of Medicare and Medicaid stand\u00ad ards, and was made in the face of strong protest by the subcommittee and despite seeming agreement by one administration spokesman. At the subcommittee's October 1973 hearings, HE1~T Assistant Sec\u00ad retary Charles Edwards seemed convinced, possibly because or sub\u00ad committee insistence, on the use of licensed personnel. He said: Furthermore, nursing personnel less qualilled than a re~isl'.et'ed lllmm M'e not capabie of recognizing many sudden, SUbtle, potentially clangerous changes, that can take place in an ill patient, nor are they prepared to exercise the judg\u00ad ment necessary to respond appropriately in allY number of patient crises.oo \"\" l'ng~ Shypulskl os Pngc 2000. llllrt 22, footnote to tHlverse ren,ctions is the context of tranquilizers which \\11',0 power\u00ad ful drugs with dangerous side eft'ects. :Many experts have emphasized the seriousness of some of these side c1fects which include: (1) a pre\u00ad disposition to accidents, (2) apathy, (a) confusion, (4) drooling of the mouth, (md (I) ditIicnlty in swallowing. loo Dr. Victor Kassel, told the subcommittee that the combinntion of the tranquilizer and encephnlopathy (brain disease or damage) eventuates in pSlledo-bulbar palsey, followed by aspiration pneumonil1 and sudden death.l01 Other writers have indicated the mngnitude of the problem; some 16 percent of the patients in a study on one State hospital geriatric ward hnd side effects from .tmnquilizers. The study concludes that at least 20 percent of all admissions to geriatric wards \"are precipitated by the adverse effects of psychoative drngs (tranquilizers).\" 102 .l\\..nothel' study lists the following itS common side effects from psy\u00ad chotropic drugs : (1) Akathisia: This disorder is more common in the middle a~e{l population and tends to onset days to months following the initiutlOll of phenothiazine thempy, with women l,>l'eclominating ovel' men in many series. It is characterized by contmuous agitatlOn or restless activity of the face and extremities with inll,bilitv to sit ot\u00b7 be still. It may closely simulate the picture of early Huntillgton's Chorea. Fre~ quently the. features of buccolingnnl associated with the gellerahzecll'estlessness. (2) Buccolingual dyskinesia: This has frequently been the for111 of phenothinzine dysldnesin. Fcntures include chewing and mouthing movements, lip smacking, licking of the lips, increased blinking and grimo.cing. and continuous aimless movements of the tongue. Hei'e, too, It more elderly population is affected, but the sy~np.toms tend to onset or be aggrav!lt<~d following cessation of pheno\u00ad tluazllle thcl'apy. (3) Dystonia: This of patients has sevel'llJ distinctive Ien.\u00ad hU'es, including relntively young age and rapidity of onset of dys\u00ad kinesia early in the course of drug therapy.

It warns of several severe side efYeets, and notes that it is i'mportant to recognize these side\u00ad effects because \"acute encephalit.is, meningitis, tetanus and other neuro\u00ad logical disorders have been diagnosed erroneously,\" and patients have b(len trented for these conclitions when, in fact, tlley have been suffer\u00ad ing from tranqllilizlw side effects.lOol These warnings cast even gL'eater doubts on the wisdom of funneling $60 million in tl'!llH111illzel's th1'0ugh the N aHon's 23,000 nUl'sing homes yearly. But the great tragedy in the use of tranquilizers is that the most active and aggl'essive patients are the most lil{ely to receive tranquilizers and yet, it is these patients who may have the best chance for rehabilitation. Elaine Brody and Morton H. Kleban of the Philadelphia Geriatrics Center in a study of mentally impaired elderly l>atients have written: In an institutional setting, there is a tendency on the part of the staff to expect conformity and cooperation. nle \"well adjusted\" people are usually those who meet those standards. Aggressive, managerial individuals elicit negative reactions from others and therefore tend to be regarded as maladjusted, \"difficult,\" and inflexible. Our data suggest very clearly that within this aggres\u00ad sive behavior is a force for self-improvement.105 III. WHO IS RESPONSIBLE? 'rhe responsibility for poorly controlled drug distribution must be shal'ed by many. Each of the foilowing playa part: (1) Federal policymn,l;:ers who set and enforce national standards.

Sl'ATE ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS As noted in Part 4 of the Introductory Report, enforcement of standal'ds by the Stn,tt's has been both In!tclequate and haphazard. State enforcement oflicials are required. by law to enforce both their own standards and Fedt'l'I1l Mt'c1icare and :Meclicaicl strmdards. As noted in Pn,l't. 4 of the Introductory Report, the enforcement of Fedel'l1l standards has been less than satisfactory. The Sl1me is true with respect to State enforeement. All too often inspections al'e few rmd far between, States have inadequate llmnbel' or poorly trained inspectors. Sometimes advance notice is given. All too often, responsibility for the enforcement of stanclards is fragmented between several State agencies and jurisdictions. O. THE RESPONSIBU.lI1'Y OF PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES Pharmaceutical companies can be faulted first because of the limited research in geriatric pharmacology and psychoplutrmacology and to some extent for their advertising techniques,l1O Drug companies tend to view the elderly as having the same strength and qtltl,lities of adult Americans. They seem to be oblivious to the fact. that older Americans have: (a) Reduced metabolic activity neces\u00ad sitating lower doses j (b) an altered response of the centml nervous system so that confusion is often associated with sedation; (c) a reduced rate of elimination which means that drugs are often retained in the body leading to oyerdoses; (cl) impairment in the homeostatic mechn,nism; (e) greater variability in response to drugs than younger Americans.l11 At the same time, drug Itdvertisements stress the social control potent~nl of many dl'~lgS, thus appealing to the managel}lent. needs and WIshes of pl'OfeSslOnnJs mthcr thn,n to the therapeutIc needs of the elderly.1l2 For example, an ad for the powerful tranquilizor, MellariI, cites benefits for \"the patient, the family, and to the staJI'.\" For th~ patient it suggests, \"Mellaril can help reduce emotional dis\u00ad tress and restore order-especially during that 'settling-in' period.\" (See advertisement reprinted on opposite page.) vYilliam R.

Oue such ad says: \"Since I retired I'm not sleeping. And I get tense during the day. My wife said, 'See the doctor.'-Tension and insomnia respond particularly well to SINEQUAN.\" Even more serious are ads such as for Cel'espan (papa verine HCL) which is promoted for angina pectoris painful contrac\u00ad tions in the chest) and cerebral ischemia (deficiency in the supply of blood to the brain). The AMA drug evaluation gUIde comments that the drug is \"useless in angina pectoris and of unproved value in cere\u00ad bral ischemia\" adding that this condition \"might be worsened by the hypotension resulting from effective dosl's.\" 11-1 Still the ad promises \"benefits to all concerned\" in relieving the symptoms of cerebral ischemia day and night for the patient; benefiting the staff by provid\u00ad ing an \"easIer to manage patient\" and benefiting the nursmg home because a \"less troublesome patient requires less nmsing care.\" (See advertisement reprinted, p. 283.)

PHYSICIANS Supporting Paper No.3 points out that only 13 of 104 F.S. medical schools has or was developing a program in which geriatrics is a specialty; that most medica,} schools provide little training in geriatrics or geriatric pharmacology and that physicians in general tend to avoid nursing homes feeling that their time is better spent with the younger members of society. Moreover, there are few continuing educatIOn programs in geriatrics for physicians and physicians cannot keep up with. the literature on new drugs. This is significant in view of one study which found that 54 percent of physicians in all types of pruc\u00ad tice felt. they had inadequate knowledge of drugs.l15 E. PHARMACISTS Medicare regulati..ons for the last '{ years have required participating nursing homes to secure the services of a consultant pharmacist. Under the regulations, the pharmacist should work with the nursing home personnel to monitor drug administration, watch for adverse reactions, and provide training. In practice, this standard has never been en\u00ad forced and very few pharmacists practice clinical pharmacy-that is, very few of them visit nursing homes to look at patients. Part of the problem is that the schools of pharmacy do not stress geriatric phar\u00ad macology or consulting pharmacy.110 In fact only 10 schools had such program on a regular basis. As a result, the American Association of Consultant Pharma\u00ad cists charges that 75 percent of U.S. nursing home patients do not receive adequate pharmaceutical services and drug controls.1t7 uo Page 1425, pnrt 15. henrlngs cited In footnote 14. 116 Pnge 21, reference cited In footnote 65. 115 See reference cited In footnote 119. tto Subcommittee questlonnnire to 74 colleges of plmrmncy, results reported In April 12, 1972. news relense of AmerIcan Society of Consultnnt Phnrmaclsts. 111 Page 96S, pnrt 11, henrlngs cited In footnote 14. -- ------------, 279 F. ADMINISTRATORS Because of a 1967 amendment introduced by Senator :E:dward M. Kennedy,llB nursing home administratol's working in homes partici\u00ad pating in and Medicaid must :meet minimum 1t'ederal li\u00ad censme requirement.s. This law, in effect, required the nur13ing home administrator to be a professionttl and consolidated in him the overall responsibility for the quality of 'Care offered 'by the facilit,y. It is the administrator who most o:\u00a3ten sets the home's staffing policies. This decision can be critical. Professor Cheung's study at the University of Southern California School of Pharmacy, reported that homes with the highest ratio of registered nurses reported the lowest rate of drug error.11n At the same time nursing home administ,rators have not been anxious to hire consultant pharmacists-even though it is required by law. A recent article in NU'I'sing Home8 concerning lax drug con\u00ad trol procedures in nursing homes states: vVe can't let the administrator off the hook. Very oft,en he is concerned with rebates, discounts or \"kickbacks\" because he does not understand how to use his consultant phar\u00ad macist.120 Inevitwbly, nursing home administrators reply that it, is all a ques\u00ad tion of money. State reimbursement rates are too low, they contend, making it impossible for them to pay for consultant pharmacists, or for the nUl'sing personnel they would like to have. Others simply view these \"extra\" personnel as unnecessary. G.NURSES Some 70 percent of the medications in use today in hospitals and nursing homes were developed within the past 20 years. At the same time, many of the registered and licensed practical nurses who work in nursing homes completed their education 10, 15, or perhaps 20 years ago. The obvious conclusion is that many of today's nurses are not adequately informed about the effects of mttny pharmaceutical prod\u00ad ucts offered to the patients. Like physicians, nurses suffer from the lack of continuing educa\u00ad tion programs in geriatrics and ::from the general lack of emphasis on geriatrics and geriatric pharmacology in schools of nursing. Of the 1,072 schools of nursing polled by 'the subcommittee, only 27 re\u00ad ported what the subcommittee staff considered an effective program offering geriatrics as a specialty; and only 135 reported any con\u00ad nection \"nth or services to nursing homes.121 A fundamental problem, of course, is the inadequate Federal stand\u00ad ard which requires only one registered nurse (RN) 8 hOllrs a day in Medicare-Medicaid's 7,300 skilled nursing homes. In the 8,500 inter\u00ad mediate care facilities under Medicaid, only one LPN for 8 hours a day is required (plus 4: hours of consultation LJer week with an RN). During the afternoon and evening shifts, the Federal standard re- 118 Public Lnw 90-248. Section 235 : see Introductory Report, pnrt 4. 1lU See references cited In footnote 3. 120 ,Afollcm Nllr8i111l Home, !lIny 1971,11. 19. m See Supporting Pnper No.4. 280 quires only one licensed practical nurse in charge of each shift. This compares poorly with many State standards. Oonnecticut, for ex\u00ad ample, requires an RN .for every 30 patients on the morning shift, one for every 45 on the afternoon, and one for every 60 on the evening shift. As the name \"charge-nurse\" indicates, these nurses must supervise their fellow employees. Howeyer, analysis indicates that the nurse& spend an alarming 54 percent of their time on nonnursing duties in\u00ad cluding administrative and clerical work, ordering supplies, pre\u00ad paring forms, and answering the telephone. m H. AIDES AND ORDERLIES As noted above, aides and orderlies pro'ide 80 to 90 percent of the care in today's long-term care facilities, These individuals are paid the minimum wage and are grossly oyerw(il'ked. Most have no previous experience and no formal training.128 In the words of Senator Moss: 'What can we really expect from unlicensed personnel who are hired in many cases right off the street? Personnel who are given the most difficult job in the world to do and are then paid only the minimum wage? I am grateful that many of these aides and orderlies come to the nursing home not for the money but because of their concern for the infirm elderly. These individuals deserve our respect. They also deserve high\u00ad er wages. Respect and higher wages are the two elements that 111l1ke any occupation deSIrable. 'WIth a greater share of each, I am sure that the 75 percent turnover rate in unlicensed per\u00ad sonnel would be markedly reduced.124 Unlicensed personnel are often given full or partial responsibility for administering medications. They are commonly given access to medication closets and to narcotics cabinets within them. These per\u00ad sonnel open prescription containers, set up medication trays, and then distribute the cu.,u&,s to the patients. It goes without saying that they have little knowlectge of drugs, their possible side effects andadyerse reactions. Until this year, Medicare and Medicaid regulations did not allow unlicensed personnel to administer medications (tIllS requirement was often ignored). Unfortunately, new regulations have weakened this standard. As of January 17, 19'74, unlicensed persollllel-may administer medications if they have completed State approved training courses.125 lJ!lI \"Is There Il Nurse Shortage?\", Nurs.ing lIomes, August 1070, p. 17. = Reference cited In footnote 34 notes that only 30 percent of the nursing homes surveyed provided In-service training progrnms for their personnel.

Moss, Federal Regi8ter, October 3, 1074, volume 30, No. lOll, part II. 281 SUMMARY In short, the causes for poor drug distribution are many. Olearly, responsibility is not limited to anyone group or profession. The Ralph Nader study ~roup, in 19'71, charged \"widespread care\u00ad lessness in ctJ'ugs in nursing homes-drugs are admin\u00ad istered incorrectly or not at all; drugs prescribed by physicians are allowed to continue too long, or too many chugs are prescribed, or ch'ugs are administered that have not been prescribed by a phy\u00adsician. j) 120 This evaluation is likely to stand for some time to como unless strenuous efforts are made to deal with root causes. A positive, and challenging, statement on the reqnisites for such reform was recently offered by Edward S. Brady, associate dean of the school of pharmacy at the 'University of Southern Oalifol'llia: Remedying the problem related to drug use by the elderly is not difficult if a few X)l'inciples are taken to heart and a few simple practices are faIthfully employed. For while the ulti\u00ad mate responsibility for medication rests with the physican, every person in lu'nlth ct),rc service has a responsibility toward each patient's drug therapy. Physicians must be certain that their prescribing is rational and that their medication orders are obeyed. Nurses must follow a rational and logical system of drug administration, yet remain alert and sensitive to symptoms in the patient which may be induced by chugs. The pharmacists must observe the total utilization of dl'Ugs by the p!ttient and qUl'stion improper combinations and overutiliza\u00ad HOll. All must lULVe access to record systems which are com\u00ad plete, cmrent.

CiISV) USV PHARMACEUTiCAL CORPORATION' New York, N.Y. 10017 \\ \\ NURSING HOME DRUG KICKBACI{S: DISCOUNTS OR EtxTORTION In 1968, a report by the attorney general of California charged that it was common practice in that State for nursing homes to requirc pharmacists to pay back a certain 1?ercentage of the price of llUl'sing home prescriptioll drugs for the prIvilege of providing such services. The amount of the kickbacks ranged from 25 to 40 percent of the total price of the prescription drugs delivered to the nursing homes.1:!8 Nursing homes in Califol'llia responded to the charge, saying that kickbacks did not exist, and :\u00a3urther if they did exist to any extent, it was the pharmacist and not the nursing home operator who was responsible. Some nursing home operators did admit that they IUld received discounts based on the large quantities 0:\u00a3 drugs they purchasecl.l2D As a result 0:\u00a3 the Californitt Attorney General's report, [t State law prohibiting kickbacks was enacted.lao However the charges against nursing homes continued. In 1970, representatives 0:\u00a3 the American Pharmaceutical Association charged flatly that kickbacks must be gi ven in order to secure a nursing home account.1S1 In 1971, the sttbcommittee received a letter from an ,accountant who serves lL chain of nursing homes in Illinois. This accountant implored the subcommittee to do something a'bout kickbacks and provided the following assertions: 1. The pharmacies which supply thp.se nursing homes have agreed to a \"kickback\" to the home which mrerages out be\u00ad tween 25-30 percent on all prescriptiOl'l drugs delivered to the home. 2. A 50 percent across the board Illdckback\" is given by the pharmucies on all welfltre prescriptions (prescrlptions paid :\u00a301' in part by a third party) .182 The subcommittee began its preliminary investigation, which to some deO'ree confirmed the charges of the accountant. 'l'he subcom\u00ad mittee afso found that lIE\"y had recognized the possibility fOl' this kind of abuse in Illinois. The HEW audit agency noted in a recent audit of Illinois that the State's reimbursement formula for drugs could lead to high profits.

This formula explamed the possibility of a 50 percent kickbackl but a wider study was needed. In cooperation wIth the American Pharmaceutical Association, the subcommittee fashioned a questionnaire which was sent to every phar\u00ad macist in the State of California and to 200 more throu~hout the N a\u00ad tion. In the questionnnire the word \"kickback\" waS definect as : The practice whereby plutrn1acists are forced to pay a C8l'\u00ad tain percentage of the ,Price, of nursing home prescription drugs, back to the llurslllg home operator for the privilege of providing those services.133 The questiOlll)fLil'e Was sent \"hlind,\" that is, 110 one neetlctl to identify himself although moaly phl'macists took advantage of the opportu\u00ad nity to ttil' their grie,vances. Some signed their names and some did not. California was selected because of its long history with drug kick\u00ad backs ane1 to test the eil'ectiveness of the intervening State law pro\u00ad hibiting the practice. (Conc1ll'rcntly, the subcommittee continued its kickback illvesti1tation m Illinois with the aid of the American College of Apothecaries.) In all, the questionnaire waS sent to 4,400 plumnacists; ,10 percent, or 1,792, were ret'l.ll'l1ed to the committoo. Of the 1,'792 responses received, 326 or 18 percent stated they had novel' attempted to serve a llursing home. Another 18 percent, 328, indicated that they had attempted to deal with llm'sill\u00a5 homes but were not approached for a kickba~k and did not believe tllC practice was widespread. Some 383 pharmacists or 21 percent indiClate(l they had tried to servo a nursing home, had not beon approached for a kickback but had a positive o~lief that they were widespread. '1'ho remaining 755 or 4:~ percent of the plu\\,r1l1acists indicated that they served nursing homes and that they had been approached \u00a301' a kickback. Of these, 700 indicated that Inckbacks were increasing, 51 indicated they were decreasing and 251 felt they were about the same. In other words, 63 l)el'cent of all phal'macists responding indi\u00ad cated an actual experience or a positive belief that kickbacl(s were widespread. Pharmacists projec~d $10,363,000 ill. lost accounts from refusing to go along with kickbaclrs in 1971. The llNeraCTe IdckbUl!k Igellel'ally fawns lugh as 50 percent. But. t.he phal'macis/ts from all parts of the country did not limit their response to the, questionnaIre. Many provided the committee with written comments and with actual llltlneS of pharmacists -and nursing home 0pol\u00b7ators.

Moss before the Amedcan Society oe Consultunt Ph/lrmllclsts, ChlcRlto, Ill., OctOber 1, 1972. 286 '1'hese admissions were made despite the fact thl.Lt these practices Itre in violation of California law. A few pharmacists accepted primary or joint responsibility for kickbacks. The following comments are typical: \"The ethical phar\u00ad macists are not usuaJly approached for a percentage kickback, most are preal'ranged by both sides.\" \"In order to testify I would have to name the 1\\1ost important members of our association. Sorry, I'm too smallnow.ll \"Not being a member of our profession, I would not expect you to lmow how We operate. It is not the nursing home that instigates the kickbac1c but the hun~ry-for-business members of our own group. They 111'0 the ones who offer the nursing home the 'deal'.\" Most of the replies the committee received are on the other side of the ledger. They char&'Cd that nursing home op(wators, driven by inadequate Medicaid rellllbursement rates were resorting to any and !.ill methods to pick up a few extra dollars. For their part the pharma.\u00ad <lists recognized little difference between discounts, collection fees, and :t'ebates. A few were willing to recognize discounts of 10 percent, or less, given for quantity purchasing 01' to have nursing home accotmts paid within 30 days. But these discounts were recognized only if voluntarily given and if such discounts could be given without inflat\u00ad ing the costs of drugs to private paying patients or to Medical'(} and Medicaicl. From the pharmacist's point of view, a voluntary discount rarely happens. One pharmacist wrote\u00b7: \"I'm afraid to testify. My biggest accOtmt is a nursing home. If I lost tIllS business, who will sustain me ~\" Another said: \"I own part of a nursin 0' home and do not get any prescriptions from them, as I wouldll'fkickback to them.\" Still another commented: \"Ill one pharmacy we served abont 12 nursing homes. \"Ve were reguired to pay 25 percent to the operator of several of the homes and lost the business of three of them when we attempted to cut the kickback to 20 percent. The vohune loss was in the vicinity of $5,000 a year.\" One pharmacist noted : \"Your effort is too late. Now many homes are owned by corporations that also own pharmacies and medical supply houses. No kickbacks as such are needed, they make it all ill the pIUtrmMy.\" Pharmacists wrote that kickbacks can be cash, i.e., 25 percent of total prescription char~es or a flat $5,000 a year. They can be in the form of long-term credIt arranO'ements, or in some cases, unpaid bills to pharmacists. They can be in tile form of rental of space in the nurs\u00ad ing home-$l,OOO a month for a closet, for example-or they can be in the form of a pharmacy bill to an individual patient in the nursing home where the home keeps 25 percent of the total bill as a \"collection fee.\" 'WIth some pharmacists the kickback is supplying drugs, vitamins, and snpplies at no charge, or merchtmdise offered to employees at no charge, or personal cosmetics and pharmacy needs of llursing home personnel delivered to the nursing home and charged to the honie.184 131 The subcommittee received nmille evidence of klckbncks 'between nUrsing homes nnd other suppliers which nre Ileyond the scope of this chnpter but two exnmples nrc provided. \"In regnrd to physlcnl thernplsts: my slster\u00b7ln-Inw Is one, she bills the holl1e for services nt $20 nn hour, she Is nllowed to keep $10 nn hour.

Still others noted that outright girts of large quantities or green stlunps, new cars, color tele\u00ad visions, boats, desks and prepaid vacations to Hawaii or El1l'ope are made. SOine are required to advertise in the home's brochure ,at tan times normal pdces. Some nursing homes have opened their own pharmacy ltnd offer shares in the corporation to othel' nUl'sing homes if they agl'M to use this new pharmacy. Examples of each of these abuses are provided below; they al'e quoted from replies the subcommittee received to its question\u00ad naire. CASH Another means of kickback is uccolllrlishecl by just send\u00ad ing over to the owners (physician-owner s love this one) 20-25 percent of previous ml)nth's gross 01' a present ree in cold cash every month. Just ~)Ut eight $50 bills or whatever in un enve\u00ad lope and hand delIver it to him or them. CREDIT One such methuil to which I have beeu. personully subjected in at leust a couple of instances involved very strong pres\u00ad sure to grant excessive credit in amounts never allowed anyone else. In euch case, the operator folded, leuving me stuck with an ullcollectable bill of one to two thousand dollars each time. Yon might not consider this to be a \"kickback.\" I do, for its origins, cause und effect were precisely the same as in the more fOl'lnal instances you might have in mind. RENTING SPACE Both places wanted me to 1'ent a complete room in EOF plus supplying their OW11 personul needs. This (at that time) wus about $1,lOO-$1,200/month with an estimated percent to volume or n:bout 20-25 percent. The pharm!tCy hud the \"aon\u00ad t1'act\" was renting a linen closet for $700/mont11 for \"storage.\" The home owner also wanted me tu explore with him the set\u00ad ting up of a company to s1..1pply thesc homes (he had two and one in the planning stage) since if the supply costs were high they would do better since they wore on a cost plus percentage with the health agencies. FUJtNISHING SUPPLIES I wus requested to supply the nursing home with such things UG mineral oil, aspirin, gauze puds, tape, etc., free of charge. These were things that the l:nll~ng home was being paid to supply in the dnn,; rates set by the State. . I was also requested to muit out prescriptions fo1' drugs that werc not used but instead I was asked to supply things that the nursing home was supposed to supply. These were to 288 1m charged to weHare. Example: Make out It prescription for n.ntibiotlC and charge to weHare but instead send to the patient a posey belt rcstraint. HIRING EMPLOYEES OS'l'ENSIBI.JY WORKING FOR THE PI-IARMAOY Kickback demands nro in various forms, not necessarily cash rebates. '1.'wo examples are: The supplying' of certain drugs, vitamins, and snpplies nt NO OHAnGE f,o the EOF. Paymg the monthly salary of a full time employee whose sole duty is to tell the pharmacy whether the patient is a MEDIOAL, MEDICAnE, or private patient in the EOF, thus ostensibly working itS an employee of the pharmncy, but in reality working for the EOF. GIFTS OF 'rRADING STAMPS Kickbacks in this ttrca are more subtle. For example, green stamps, advertising in facilities' promotional brochures at 10 times the normal prices. GIFTS OF OOLOR TELEVISIONS AND BO.A.TS I have no real proof of kickbacks on a specific situation as far as cash is concerned-however, I do know that on the Xmas of one year, .color TV's were delivered and paid 101' by one of the stores-also, the following year a boat was giyen\u00ad also, massive amonnts of trading stamps are sent tID the facility. PREPAID VAOATIONS In this area the \"kickback\" is in the form of personal grati\u00ad tude such as prepaid trips to Hawaii, Japan, a new desk, f1'ee use of a ski cabin, beach house, or other valuable usage. ADVERTISING Because of my refusal to \"buy advertising space\" in their monthly nursing home newsletter (a tlu'ee-page affair) prl\\ced at $124 ,pel' month (my rebate computed at 10 pel\u00b7cent. of medical charges and 15 percent of private patient ehargl3s) l I was dropped fiS the pharmtv~.y to provide services. vVhether I buy advertisinO' space or sUp them the mouey iu cl1sh under the table, it is stftl graft. and I certainly hope you !l,re ablEI to stem this horrible practice.

Many also felt that rE!imbursement formulas for welfare medications too low, stating thnt the necessity to pay kickbacks leads pharmacists to many shortcu.ts. As an illustration~ one 290 pharmacist noted that a prescription might cost $4.50 plus a fee of $2.30. This was the most welfare would allow as a fee. Thus the total price of the prescription would be $6.80 and with a 25 percent Idclcback of $1.70, only 60 cents would be left over for profit, salary, rent, etc. Accordingly, some of the pharmacists admitted: (1) Billing welfare for nonexistent prescriptions. (2) Supplying outdated drugs or drugs of questionable value. (3) Supplying stolen drugs which they have purchased or sup- plying discarded drugs (those belonging to dead or discharged patients). (4) Supplying drug samples which they have received free of charge. (5) Supplying' generic drugs and charging the State for brand name drugs. (6) Dispensing less than the prescribed a.mount and billing for the full amount. (7) Raising the amount pl'escribed by the doctor (kiting) and billing for the same\" (8) Billing for refills not dispensed. (9) Receiving payment from a patient and submitting invoice for payment. (10) Using a particular line of drugs because the manufacturer has a price list where every item is listed at a higher price than is actually chai\u00b7ged. By using such products the pharmacist can charge the State more and make a higher profit.135 The practices u,bove are highly questiona:ble and in most cases cleu,rly illegaL There are mltuy reasons for the prevalence of these practices but the pl'in~ary cause is the reimbursement system for nursing home druO's. !fow does this system world Obviously, there u,l'e many variations u,mong the 50 States but in geneml the practice works as follows. The phu,rmacisi; presents u, bill (often unitemized) for Pl'escl'iptions to the llursin\u00a5 home. The nursing home then bills each individual vaLient collectmg from those who pa.y for their own dru~s and sendmg the balallce to the State welia.re depal'tment or to MeCllcare for payment. Neither the ving payment from these third pa.rty payers, the nursing home then reimburses the pharmacist (often keeping a prearmnged per\u00ad . 'TIns policy the nursing home to act as the \"middle man\" between the pluU'm!tCy (which supplies the druO's) and the source of payment (private patient, 1:1!>dicare or Medicaid') creates an inviting atmosphere for abuse. The shortcomings of this questionable policy are obvious: (1) Medicare, Medicaid, and the private patient have no idea what they are paying for. The bill does not come from the pharmacist, but from the nursing: home, mId it is often unitemized. Close scrutiny of a bill is extremely aifficult, if not impossible. 1M For 111~t!'nc~s of IntIatlon of tho cost of drugs furnished to nursing home patients: One Ilharmaclst wrote: ,,:;:. ,\\otic\u20acS that somcthlng UbOllt It;\" Sec 11 In fooh:ote 14; puges 220'1, 2314, on puge 2314, PUl't 19J> of same hearings, related to the filet that a patient's drug bill tripled for the same medication upon entering n nursing home. 291 (2) \"Cozy\" relationships between pharmacies and nursing homes a\u00b7re encouraged whereby both parties call benefit at the expense of the private patient and the public. 'With the taxpayers payin~ $2 out of every $3 that goes into nursing homes, the implications of a nursing home owning Its own pharmacy are all the more serious. (3) In the end, pharl11fi.cies and nursing homes find it easy to covel' up mistakes and increase their profits. After reviewing the results of this questionnaire, Senatoi-Moss di\u00ad rected that a questionnaire be sent (the same form) to pharmacies in and around Chicago.laO One hundrecl pharmacies were selected at ran\u00ad dom. In the case of t.he pharmacists in Chicago) their retumeel ques\u00ad tionnaires indicated the same pattel'll. Some 27 percent of the returns indicated that they had. not attempted to serve a nursing home; another 23 percent. inclicat~d that they had served nursing homes, but had not been approached fol' a kickback. The remaining 58 percent indicated that they had been approached for a kickback or had a positive belief they were widespread. The Senator also directed that a similar questiomlaire be sent to every administrator of a long-term care facility in Ca.lifornia. The questionnai.re had the followmg results: 2,050 questiol1lmires were sent; 30 percent or 619 'were returned. Of the 619 returns, only 20 nursing home operators indicated having an interest in a pharmacy; 60 percent (or 373) indicatec1 that their nursing homes were served by more than one pharmacy; 78 percent (01' 484) nursing home providers stated they had never oilered or accepteel a kickback; 67 percent (or 415) indicatec1 they dic1 not believe kickbacks were wic1espread. For the most part, llursing hm\"'!le owners were much less free with their additional written cOllunents. The comments that were receivecl related to the definition of the word \"kickback\" and to the inade\u00ad quate nursing home reimbursement rates. Nursing home operators went to great pains to emphasize a. dif\u00ad ference between unearned \"kickbacks\" or other considerlittion and ,,,. Is to be emphuslzed thut 200 of the origlnnl questionnaires were sent to phnrmuclsts llround the Nutloll. 'rhelr repUes (identified by postmarks) were much the sume IlS those received from Callfornln. For example: \"Klckbllcks homes nreu business; 1058. \"The the hnnel!! of nUrsing homes by allowing the nlll'slug home to bill for pharmuceuticnl ser\\'!ces nor the phnrmuclst to effect their own b!1llng; ns do other professlonnls in the mp.dlcal field, 'rltls practice hns Incrensed the cost of medications tremendously to nursing home cllen tele, no mntter who pnys the hill. \"1 believe the prnctlce of ],ickbnek to be present in 9(; percent of homes In St. Peters\u00ad bUrg, ~tj'ln.\" \" II< \"Why _ .

They pointed out that in many cases, nursing homes bill all the patients in their homes and that they collect the money from their individu~l'private paying. patients. This. saves the pharmacists the cost of bIllmg and collectmg from llur~lllg home patients individually. It also /tHows the pharmacist to receIve a lun~p sum payment which is paid by the nursing home on behaH of Its patients. . I\u00a3 the pharmacy were troubled to collect from individlHLl patIents, presumably it would have to wait longer ror its payment. In the case of Medicare u.nd Medicaid, pharmaeies often have to wait for months for final payment. The nursing homes feel they create a cash flow for the pharmacist and that they gnarantee payment from individual pri\u00ad vate paying patients. For this service and because of the large quan\u00ad tities of drugs purchased, many nursing home operators believe they are entitled to a cut or discount. The following' comments are typical: \"Everyone gets their cost except the nursll1~ homes so they must accept discounts from the pharmacy.\" \"Kickbacl;:s are wrong in any field, however, I do not :feel a discount for bnyin~ volume merchandise and providing book\u00ad keeping services for billmg !1re wrong. Discounts are part of the American scene.\" \"Thecommoll misconception is that a I?harma\u00ad cise should receive retail prices for, let's say, 400 prescriptIOns de\u00ad livered to the nursing home and \"'hich the nursing home collects for the pharmacy, guaranteeing payment. An arrangement involving a fee for nursing home services should be reco~nized as legitimate. Some pharmncists want full retail for a \"wholesl11e\" account and don't care who pays. Nursing homes in most cases bargain for better prices and pass at least part of the savings on in terms of reduced costs, or as discounts taken, etc., to their patients, private and Medicare.\" Clearly, the results of the, two questionnaires indicate two dif\u00ad fering points of view. On the one hand, pharmacists indicate they are forced to pay a kickback as a preconchtion of obtaining n 11111'S\u00ad ing home account; on the I)thel' hand, nursing homes claim they are legitimate discounts justified by their quantit.y buying or because of \"billing sl'rvices\" pei'formed for the pharmacist. The line between \"kickbacks\" and discounts is perhaps difficult to draw. However, there are several factors which should be con&iderecl. Is the arrangement between the parties cHsc10sed ? Is the \"discount\" volunb~ry ~iven or is it manditory? Is the \"discount)) a pre,reqllisIte of doing business with the nurs\u00ad ing home? Is the amount (or percentage) of the discount nominal or ex\u00ad cessive? Although these distinctions remained unresolved, some conclusions can be drawn: First-the profit in drugs supplied the nursing home is being shared. Pharmacists claim theyal'e unwilling partners-that they are the victims of extortion. Nursing home operatol's allege that the discounts are voluntarily given by the pharmacists. 293 Second-the costs of drugs to private paying patients and to the taxpayer is being inflated. Pharmacists indicate that the pres\u00ad sure of ldckbacks or discounts causes them to get as high a price for their drugs as they can, whether the party paying is the State, Federal G<:lvernment, or the individual. One pharmacist wrote that an item which cost $1.79 in the pharmacy was priced at $7.9'5 to the nursing home patient. Subcommittee files reflect many such examples, including one in which the l>atient's drug bill tripled for the same medications upon entering a nursing home. Third-because the practice of \"ldckbaclrs\" is widespread, some pharmacists are resorting to unethical methods to lower their costs, such as charging the Government for nonexistent drugs, supplying generic drugs and charging for name bl'auds, supplying old or ineffective drugs, supplying samples which they have re\u00ad ceived for free, and reusing discarded or supplying stolen drugs. ':1:'0 put an end to these serious abuses und to resolve definitional dis\u00ad tinctions, Senator' Moss tUl'lled to the industry. Office.rs and members of the American Nursing Home Association met with Senator Moss and the subcoml11ittBe sta.ft\u00b7 and pledged their best efforts towarcl home u,nd the pharmacist and to distinguish kickbacks fro111 earned discounts. The Association in tact appointed a h1ue ribbon pa:nel, promising the subcommittee a full report itddressed to these objectives. Their efforts resulted in a 2% page list of \"suggested prin\u00ad ciples\" in 'which \"kickback\" is not even mentioned. The es\u00ad document is one line: \"The finallcial al'mngement be\u00ad tween the pharmacist and the nursing home should be fully dis\u00ad closed. \" 187 By contrast, spokesmen for the National Council on Health Care Services (NOHOS) gave the problem far greater ltttention in 1973. A press release from NCHOS says in part, \"Nursing home 'kickbacks or rebates' pose a serious threat in the relationship with the pharmacy profession and in the optimum delhTery of health care.\" Mr. Berkley Bennett, executive vice president of NCHCS offered som.e definitions: Rl3ba.tl3-\"Whel'ea home takes backa dollar percentage of all drugs delivered.

But some States, such as Arizona and Califol'llia., prohibited kickbacks. In November 1972, the President signed H.R. 1 (Public Law 92-(03), whose section 242 provided penaltIes of a year III jail and a $10,000 fine for soliciting, offering 01' accepting bribes or kickbacks.lso It has been more than 2 years since Senator Moss revealed the widespread existence of kickbacl{s. And it has been more than 2 years since the law prohibiting ldckbacks was entered on the books. Unhappily, HEW has never announced regulations to implement this law. Accordingly, States are given no instruction as to how to enforce the law and therefore must rely on their own definitions of fraud. Not unsUllprisingly, reports of kickbacks continue. For example, over half of the California pharmacists polled by the subcommittee in January 1974 indicated that kickbacks were widespread and that the intervening Federal statute had little effect. Senator Moss called for a \"full-scale\" investigation by the U.S. General Accounting Office, tUl'Iling over the leads and other information received by the sub\u00ad committee. Of equal interest is a report from Paul Allen, director, bureau of medical assistance1 State of Michigan Department of Social Services. He relntes the nctlvities of Miahigan's postpnyment surveillance and investiO'ntion section, sometimes known as the \"Medicaid Fraud Squttd.'f, The fraud squad documented a large number of kickbacks and other fraudulent schemes Itmong nursing homes, pharmacists and other providers such as ambulance companies, doctors 'and dentists. The fraud squad recouped $1,040,000 and avoided payment of an addi\u00ad tional $740,000 in Michigan last year.1<IO Specifically with respect to pharmaceutical services they found: Inaccurate acquisition cost reportino' for drugs. Prescription splitting (instead of gilling for one 30-day supply as written, sending two 15-day supplies and collecting a fee for l'aeh).

(/ S~'I.~ral pharmaceutical providers were involved in \"deals\" in ntfrsing homes. 13.'1l\\fny 1073, press release from of Consultant Phnrmaclsts. '''' Stntute reprlnt~d In Appendix 1, p. 207. 110 September 16, 1974. letter to Vnl J. Halnmnndnrls from Mlchlgnn Dcpnrtmcn t of Social Services. 295 The discovery of 50 cases of kickbacks and other abuses involving pharmacists and nm'slng home operators allowed the recovery of $396,416.24 and prevented the fraudulent payment of another $141,- 144.05 in Michigan last year. In short, more than one-huH million in pharmacy related. abuses was discovered in Micbigan alone. If this same savings could be projected to the entire 50 States, an estimated savings of over $15 million 'would result.loll This $15 million fignre is probwbly a low estimate because it is based only on illegal activities which were documented. Nevertheless, the figure still represents 5 percent of the Nation's $300 million nursing home drug hill. It is apparent that the law making kickbacks illegal must im\u00ad mediately be implemented and vigorously enforced by HEW. The alternative is to accept the rationalization of one nursing home operator who wrote: \"Kich:backs are a way of life in this country; there is a little larceny in us all.\" RECOMMENDATIONS A. GENERAL 1. Nursing homes should take strong and immediate measures to improve the quality of medication distribution. This can be accomplished in sevenl ways. First, by employing greater numbers of registered nurses; second, by greater personal supervision of drug distribution practices; third, by employing and cooperating with consultant phal'macists as required by Medicare\u00b7Medicaid regulations for skilled nursing facilities; and fourth, by adopting unit dose distribution systems. 2. The subcommittee concurs with the U.S. General Account\u00ad ing Office findings that traditional drug distribution systems produce (1) a significant degree of medication errors, (2) staff inefficiency, and (3) medication loss; and in its recommendation that long-term care institutions adopt this system.142 However, as implied above, unit dose may not be the total answer to the drug distribution problems of each of America's 23,000 nursing homes. Accordingly, HEW should conduct a study of the safety and possible savings of unit dose and other system with an eye to upgrading existing regulations. 3. The l'egulation requiring skilled nursing homes to employ consultant pharmacists must be enforced by HEW and the States. 4. Only licensed personnel, registered nurses, and licensed practical nurses should be allowed to set up or pass medications in both skilled or intermediate care facilities. In lesser facilities such as pel'sonal care and boarding homes, States should require requisite minimum training for pel'sonnel given this important responsibility. 1<1..A. projection based on the fMt that Michigan hRS about 3.6 percent of the Nation's nursing home bedS.

The deletions and omissions in the Medicare/Medicaid standards effected by the January 1974 regulations should be reinstated. HEW should enforce the existing l'egulations (405: 1127) and conduct some \"spot inspections\" within the States to insure compliance; to insUl'e that medications are not being given without physician's order and that there are stop orders in effect for all medications. 6. Doctors and nurses should place more emphasis on the propel' recording of medications on the patients charts. 7. Nursing personnel who reuse medication or prescribe medi\u00ad cations on their own initiative should face licensure revocation or censure hearings conducted by State agencies. 8. Nursing home administrators working with nurses and consultant pharmacists should make a concerted effOl't to reduced medication errors, to limit adverse reactions, and psychic or physical dependence. 9. The FDA should be more vigilant in its control of human experiments conducted in nursing homes; they should not be conducted unless individuals are competent and can give effec\u00ad tive informed consent. 10. Pharmaceutical companies should conduct greater research in geriatric pharmacology and psychopharmacology, taldng into consideration the changes that aging brings to body systems. 11. Advertisements for medication should be written in concise simple terms. The FDA and FTC should insure that they are truthful to the point where they reflect possible side effects and untoward reactions. The purpose should be informative, not income generative. 12. More literature should be written in simple terms for the purpose of informing health professionals who are hard pressed to keep up with the latest pharmaceutical developments. B. RECOMMENDATIONS WITH RESPECT TO KICKBACKS 1. The nursing home should be eliminated as the \"middleman\" between the pharmacy and the source of payment (private patient, State welfare department, or Medicare intermediary). 2. The right of l)atients to choose their own pharmacy should be secured. 3. Pharmacjsts should be required to submit itemized bills in all cases (to the welfare department, Medicare and to the pri\u00ad vate paying patient). i1. Section 242 of Public Law 92-603 prohibiting ldckbacks should be vigorously enforced. Long overdue regulations clearly distinguishing ldckbacks from disc(lunts should be immediately promulgated. 5. The' patient's name, the medication price, the name of the drug, the size of dose, and the total drugs supplied should be printed on each prescription label. ,', 6. The interest of professionals such as physicians and nursing home owners in phal'macies and vice versa should be disclosed to the State if not prohibited outri/:ht. State agencies should exer\u00ad cise special vigilance where interlocldng ownership of nursing homes and pharmacies is present with greater frequency of audits and review to protect the public interest.

Is it possible been the outrugeous find unconscIonable mdlgOltws that many of theu' patlents would be ca1li~c1 upon to endure? ... Is it not possible too, that, however unwittingly, sponsors of a 1971 Fedel'all'egulation requiring medical review and audit of qun.1ity-of-cl'lre in nursing homes were somehow movEld by the Judeo-Christian ethic thnt each of us -1S his brother's keep(\\r and must not wnJk by on the other side in the face of his udversity ~ I like to think so J Part 250.23 of the Code of Fedeml Regulations calling for \"Periodic Medical Review and Medical Illspections in Skilled Nursing Homes and Mental H()spitl~ls\" became effective May 3, Hill. And, although , its provisions \"al'e applicable specifically to persons eligible for nmsing homa and of Medico,id bene\u00ad ficiaries (who constitute the majority of patients in most of these facilities) can be its salutary influence in mising the over-all profes\u00ad sional tone and improving pattel'ns of cu,re for all other plttients in the same fncilittes, be they Medic!ll'c or private-pay. This epic stntute is the Fec1ernlregulatioll that really zeros in 011 the very fulcrtlm of qunlity nursing home care; fulfillment of physicians' mornl, professional, ethical and legal duties and obligations once ther accept patients, ancI undertake management of th~il' mec1icnJ cnre. Effectively Implemented nlld rationally enforced, periodic medicnll'eview has mOI:e muscle and {?l'eltter potentialities for putting an end to unresponsive, ul1superviseCl, it'l'espollsible, discontinuous, and iudifferent kinds of nursing home to the inappl'opl'inte plncement of long-term pl1,tients-l1ow iiOO characteristic of altogether too many of our long\u00ad term cltre facilities in too many of our states.

Collectively, these reviews covered s(>ventyufive nurs\u00ad ing homes and It tell percent random sample o:f tlH'il' 3,400 care (to 'Use the worclloosely) for two years.

Some were taking two and often th1'ee phenotdnzine, drngs concurrently. Most of the patients reviewed were on one to :full1' different drugs; and many wero taking fil'om seven to twelve dil'Ugs j some 'were on both psychotropic UPPOll'S and downers at t,he same time. A the patients being \\;r('atecl :for cliabet('s mellitus. hacl no diagnosis of diabetes on theill' charts i and over 1n% of those receiving insulin or ornl hypoglycemic !tgents were not on dia\u00ad betic diets; and a hU'ge nUlrlbel' of these had not had a fasting blood/sugar test in more than a yen,t'. Revisea treatment or me.clicatl.on orders had been written in the past 30 days for only 18 pel'cetllt of the patients. 40% hacl not been seen by a physician for over threo months. In the full year preceding reviows : Only 6% of the patients had had wero No nursing-enl'o pl!tllS existed with l'('spect to and fluids for personal care for 23%; Mtivlties for 14% i andlmlivid\u00ad ual treatment needs fot' 18% of the, patients. In-s~rvico staff training programs were concludec} by only 39% of the homes. \"Gang visits\" of individual physidalls on multiple patients in n paltry few minutrs was not uncommon. 304 These findings are neither isolated :t101' atypical in terms of the rest of the country. However, what they do epItomize are the classically nnn,cceptab1e conditions and pl'actices from whic11 periodic medical review was spawned and to which its corrective provisions are ad\u00ad dressed. Stated sin::ply, the function 'and gut thrust of periodic medical re\u00ad view is to bring to a grinding halt uncaring attitudes and indifferent care that are tantamount 'to medical abandonment of nursing home pa\u00ad tients-and to accomplish this by meallS of on-going professional audits to detel'lnine and document if the level of c!u'e being provided is indeed appropriate and necessary; :.-md if so, to ascertain whether or not physician, nursing, persolUtl, and social care and services 'are of acceptable quali:ty, adequate in quantity, and sufficient in scope; and are beinO' rendered in a timely manner under environmenval condi\u00ad tions ::md orO'allizational circumstances that promote the optimum physical wellbeing, emotional stability, functional health, and social welfare of patients. Periodic medical review is not to be confused with nor does it replace mandatory utilization review required under both Title XVIII (Medi\u00ad care) and XIX (Medicaid). Medicall'eview is exclusively qualIty-of\u00ad care oriented and must be carried out on behalf of eac'h and every Medicaid patient in skill<3d nursing homes or mental hospitals; where\u00ad as, ut.ilization review has a level-of-cltre, cost-saving emphasis, and is applied on a sampling basis only. And, although it has been said that periodic medical review and utilization reviews are mutually exc.r~lsive, this is not entirely so, for to some degree, each can enhance the other's purposes and effectiveness. In the same vein, periodic medical review of patient care and services is only tangentially conce1'lled with physi\u00ad cal facility, staffing, and envirolUnental factors that otherwise ~all within the province of state licensure programs. In a manner of speak\u00ad ing: licensure inspections are intended to scrutinize the characteristics and condition of the nest; whereas medical reviews are intended t.o r.valuate the quantity and quality of the eggs. The tlm::e profesSional disciplines most affecting the physical, emo\u00ad tional, functional, and social wellbeing and progress of nUl'sing home patient!; are physicians, nurses, and social workers. Appraisal of how ,vell those professiolln.ls are responding separately and in relation to each other in providing care that is timely and conforms to acceptable standards and practices is the singular aIm of pntient-cc-:ltered mecli\u00ad cal review. To get a feel of how f.ar a.long the road towards better nursing home c::tre the uniVersal implomentation of periodic medical review can tuke us, het'a is the essence OT some of its highlight provisions fl,nd re\u00b7\u00b7 quiremonts: A. AH StlLte plans provic1ing medical assistance for eligible patients in skilled nursing homes, ancl care in mental hospit.als for medic::tl H,ssistal1ce patients over age 64 must. pr0vide for on-sight evaluations of ,'\u00b7~ch and every such patient at least 1111l1un lly and more often as <:~ 'cnmsvrmces m.ay require-condnctecl by medical review teams of a physi.~ian team leader, 011(' 01' more registered professional Iml'ses, and a i.mined social work specialist l_to e11snre that each such i Tltls XIX fjlngle State \"gencles nre held fully responsible effective Implementn\u00ad tion nnrl ndminlstrlltion of periodic medlcni metIlcnl Ors-nnlzations. I 30e; patient receives prior to, at the time of, or immedio,tely following o,clmission, a complete medico,l evaluation which includes a compre\u00ad hensive medical history, a complete physical examination, recorded ~liagnoses, his mento,land l)hvsical functional tinued care III the fo,cility; o,nd, a written plan of care which includes orders for medications, treatments, l'estol'ative services, diet, activities, o,nd plans for conti7'~uing co,r(' when the patient's condition improves to a point when his J1eI,'ds co,n be met in an 'altel'llative setting where care on a less continuous h.nd active level than that provided in skilled mtrs\u00ad ing homes and hospitals for menbLl disease is available, Comment: Abstracts of a patient's course during a hospital stay, such as a pel'ftUlctory discharge snmmary or a sketchy transfer form, are no longer acceptable in satisfaction of this requirement, Beca.use nursing home patients usually have multiple chronic diseases and disabilities, and, because physicians tend to miss more diagnoses by not looking than by not knowing; and, because a patiell{;'s original physician does not always continue as the pa\u00ad ti('nt's attending in th(' nlll'sing home-a complete work-up such as that just described is basic to setting the stage and professional clilIy.ate for appropriate and adequate on-going care of these patIents, Dealing with multiple and often fluctuating chronic ancl de\u00ad generative problems that beset elderly patients in nursing homes calls for a vastly different clinical and attitudiuaJ approach on the parts of physicians than treatment of a single disease 01' symp\u00ad tom in an acute short-term hospital. In long-term care, the aim is to preserve whiLt can be preserved by practicing preventive geriatric medicine so diseuse or impairments already present 'won't \\\"\\'orsen; and to im~l'ove what can be improved hy practicing therapeutic, rehabilItative medicine of conventional kinds. But, if those dual goals are to be reached, attending physicans of mus\u00ad ing home patients must treat the whole person and not just his overt symptoms while permitting other aspects of his physician needs and psychological problems to go unattended. B. :Medical review teams must audit each patient's l'ecord to ensure that it is complete and current, and contains evidence of physicians' medical evaluation as described previously; follow-up medical evalua\u00ad tions as indicated by the patient's diagnosis and. condition; a medical plan-of-cttre, and e-iridence that it is being followed; a nursing plan\u00ad of-care, and evidence that it is being rollowecl; physician review and re-authentication of medication and treatment orders not less fre\u00ad quently than every thirty days; appropriate and timely physician progress notes; adequate nursing notes reflecting medication and treatments given and patient responses thereto; observations of signifi\u00ad cant clinical or behavioral changes in the patient; approprIate nurs\u00ad ing and related notes reflecting significant aspects of the patient's physical, personal, and psychological functioning i physician orders and instructions respecting dill.gnostic tests, provision of paramedical sel:vices; and, the orderly and continuotts recording o\u00a3 the fore\u00ad gomg and results therefrom, 306 Comment: Maintenance of comprehensive, complete, and current medical records constitutes mtle more than the \"bookkeeping\" of patient\u00ad care; and, like the routine auditing of \"bookkeeping\" records of fiscal affairs, patient-care \"bookkeeping\" also must be sub\u00ad ject to periodic audit. ~Iost hospitals know this; most llursing homes have yet to learn It t C. Medical review team members must carry out individualized pa\u00ad tient evaluations at the bedside or elsewhere in the flwility. This en\u00ad tails conversation with and professional observations of each and every patients; and, the correlation of bedside findings with related data in the medical record. Factors to be observed during such ap\u00ad praisals include: presence of decubitus ulcers; the patient's nutritional and hydrn.tion status; evidence of training and encouragement in ambulation, self-help in personal care, social activities, etc.; evidence of humane, considerate, and attentive care and emotional support; patients' attitude to their present place\u00ad ment and care; patients' social and family problems and circumstances and the impact of these on the clinical and emotional status and prog\u00ad ress of patients. Comment: This one-to-one communication 'and eyeballing of each patient prevents medical review from deteriorating into a mindless, me\u00ad chanical, and relatively meaningless ritual-as is the case with too many official inspections of nursing homes by other agencies for other purposes. D. Hencefort:h, attending physici'ans will be required to visit their nursing home patients not less often than every thirty days. On such visits they must re-evaluate the patient; write new and revalidate existing orders for medications, treatments, diagnostic tests, para\u00ad medical services, n,nd instructions for nursing care 'and personal\" sup\u00ad P01't ingly. Comment: Historically, phY8icians have been casual 'and reluctant visitors in nursing homes. Common among excuses given for such dis en\u00ad gagementare: caring for patients with long-term, chronic ill\u00ad nesses lacks the drama and satisfactions that go with treating and cm'ing acute symptoms and disease; progress of patients ,is slow and often frustrating; only a few patients are involved; llUl'sing home locations make visits incon vanient; and caring for 'public assistance and low-income older patients has a low, uncertam nco\u00ad nomic return in relation to the professional time and effort it is necessary to expend on them. Nursing homes have lacked the same leverage as hospitals en\u00ad joy by virtue of the sanctions which they can employ to ensure responsible and responsive patient-Cltre attentiveness, the mainte\u00ad nance of adequate medical records, etc., on parts of physicians who use 1;,he facilities. However, with the passage of HR-l, and with the possible introduction of other promising legislative amend-!I ments and regulations now under active. discussion on Car.itol Hill, there is every reason for hope that multitudes of our aIling aging patients now subject to the caprices of a relatively unregu-307 lated, uncoordinated, and medically unsophisticated long-term\u00ad care industry may be able to look forward to brighter, more promising futures. III the \"Works or in the cards among influences 'and actions pointing to better days through better CH,l'e inlietter long-term care fndlities for afllicted old'sterE\\ are such necessary and well-intentioned expectancies as: Nursing homes, ill all probability, will be required to appoint and cloak withappropl'i'ltte authority full-time or part-time non\u00ad vested-interest medical directors to serve as medical-staff equiva\u00ad lents ill developing and enforcing medical care procedures 'and medical practice policies. In all likelihood nmslng homes will be required to develop and enforce medical-care proc('c1ul'es 'and medical practice policles, as the counterpart of hospital medical staff by laws, rules and regula\u00ad tions, which are acceptable to voluntary accreditation programs, 'and to official certification and liccllsin~ agencies, and which must be provided for, signed by,and 8,dherccl to on the part of each and every physician utilizing a given facility's resources for care of his long-term patients. In multi-facilit;y areas, public policy and a means could very well he brought mto play to eIlcourage j if not indeed require, physicians to elect the use of and to seek privileges ata smgle nursing home, or a limited few long-term care faCIlities. ,It should {!ome as no surprise when official {lictum requires that all licensed nursing homes and rebtcd care facilities be formally ,and officially 'affiliated with a single accredited general hospital; wherein, the affiliate hospital medical staff and the hospital's pro\u00ad fessional-care structures are programatically superimposed upon the affiliate long-term facility. It is 'a foregoneconclusioll that a modified v(,,!'SiOll of periodic medical review now covering Title XIX patients receiving care in skilled nursing homes and mental hospitals soon will be made -applicable to Title XL\"C patients in intermediate nursing care and intermediate personal care facilities. That periodic medical review as spelled out in Section 250.23 must perforce, and sooner than later, become applicable to patients receiving care in extended care facilities under Title XVIII seems hardly debatable. ' At 'loll<>'-last the AMA and its component StAtte 'Und County Medical \u00a7ocieties have taken 'a quarter-turn in the direction of exhibiting what gives every appearance of being a serious interest in carrying out peer review of admissions to and quality-of-cl1re audits in health-care facilities, including nursing homes, through Professional Service Review Organiz'ations, FOlmdations for Meqical Care and the like. This strikes many observers as 'a par\u00ad Hal answer by organized medicine to a prolonged public clamor that has been saying to the medical-community : \"Don't just stand there-do something I\" As the current trick1e towards capitation, pi:ep.:wmer!\" group practices and Health Maintenance Organizations ~i:.k(;s on the power 'lund proportions of 'an irreversible flood; and as more and more public assistance and publicly assisted sectors of regiollal popult1Jtions become enrolled in these progrpvms, m~,t of the pres- -------'=-----------' 308 ent difficulties experienced in controlling utilization and quality\u00ad of-care externally will vanish because of the operational modes of prepayment group pmctices internally. However desperately needed they may be, the several hoped-for de\u00ad velopments just cited lie somewhere in the future; hopefully, in the near future. So, for the time being, we must exploit fully the intent and substance of what is here and now-periodic medical review-the singular instrumentality that holds promise of having a more pro\u00ad nounced impact on raismg standards of care in the natIOn's 14,000 or so nursing homes, and on improving the lot and functional health of their 800,000 or so patients than possible all other Federal re~ulations nddressed to similar purposes enacted to date. Obviously, tne effec\u00ad tiveness and widespread acceptance of periodic medical r~view among skilled nursing homes and mental hospitals will depend importantly on the spirit in which Title XIX Single State Agenjies go about the task. If implementation is conducted WIthin an attitudinal posture that views the promotion of adherence to its provisions as essentially n,n educational, consultative, and supportive undertaking in the pubJic interest, the effort is likely to yield rewarding results i but, if it is thou~ht of as just Olle more poli~ing apparatus to be enforced, results are likely to fall short of expectatIOns. CritiCism of and resistance to Regulation 250.23 where periodic medical review is already underway has been minimal. Adverse atti\u00ad tudes usually come down to two expressed concerns: Are you trying to make-over nursing homes into jlUlior hos\u00ad pitals? Are you trying to force physicians' practices ill mll.'sing homes up to the standards expected of them in hospitals? Assuredly, the answer to both of these questions must be an un\u00ad qualified yes! It could not be otherwise-that is-if nursing homes intend to be accepted as respectable members, and respected neighbors within Amel'ic~t's health-care community. APPENDIX 4 LETTER FROM DON T. BARRY, PRESIDENT, AMERICAN NURSING HOME ASSOCIATION; TO SENATOR FRANK E. MOSS, DEC. 8, 1972 Al\\IERICAN NURSING HOME ASSOOIATION, Washington, D.O., Deoemoe1'8, 19?,~. DEAR SENATOR Moss: I would like to take this opportunity to report on the action which our Association has undertaken since your address for the American Society of Consultant Pharmacists in Chi\u00ad cago during their recent convention. Immediately following our conversation with you and Mr. Val Halamandaris of your staff and your address at the ASOP conven\u00ad tion) our Executive Boa.rd and Governing Council requested t1mt the Association contact the other major groups who are involved in the area of provision of pharmacy services to nursing homes. This we have proceeded to do. MeetJngs were scheduled with the Executive Secretary of the N a\u00ad tional Association of Retail Druggists, the Executive Director of the American Pharmacent,ical AssoClation and va.rious consultant phar\u00ad macists to nursing homes. In addition to meetings with the above mentioned grouJ2s individ\u00ad ually, we have retained the services of Mr. Carl Lyons who is a li\u00ad censed 'Pharmacist and a member of the American Pharmaceutical Association to assist in the development, in cooperation with the American Pharmaceutical Association and the National Association of Retail Druggists, of a position paper on the relatJonship between pharmacists and nursing homes. In addition he will assist ill updating of our manual which we pub\u00ad lish in cooperation with the American Pharmaceutical Association, The American Society of Hospital Pharmacists and Roche Labora\u00ad tories, Division of Hoffman-La Roche Inc. We will seek the support of other groups in the formulation of the position paper which will be made available to you for your consideration and input. We would hope that through such coope.mtion with, the other in\u00ad volved groups and your office, and Mr. Halamandaris in particular, we can solve many of the recurring problems in this area. Sincerely, DON T. BARRY, President. (309) ---------_ ......... -APPENDIX 5 RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN NURSING HOME FACILITIES AND PHARMACISTS: PHARMACEUTICAL SERVICES, APRIL 1973 - [AMERICAN NURSING HOME ASSOCIATION] SUGGES1'JDD PmNOIPLES PUEAlIIBLE Recent developments in the delivery of pharmaceutical services, and particularly the delivery of services within the nursing home, indicate that traditIOnal concepts of the relationship between a nursing home and a pharmacist are unresponsive t.o present patient, pharmacist, facility 01' third party insurer needs. Today pharmaceutical services encompass more than the provision of a specific drug to a nursing home patient. Pharmaceutical servicflii: in a health care facility encompass the con\u00ad trol of the use of drugs \"i:l'hich is the sum total of knowledo-e, nnder\u00ad standin/?', judgments, pro(~edures, skills, controls, and ethics tllat assure the optIOnal safety in the distribution and administration of medica\u00ad tions by both the pharmacist and the facility's persOlUlel. The relationshIp between the nursing liome and the pharmacists, t.herefore, must be built on the recognition of the broader aspects of these services, In the past, payment for pharmaceutical servires has centered primarily on the drug product delivered to the patient. The payment in turn has been calculated and expressed in most instances as a percentage of the cost of the drug product. The relationship between the nursing home facility and the phar\u00ad macist must incorporate three factors: (1) Pharmaceutical Services; (2) Drug Product; and (3) F-acility Administrative Services. These tlU'ee components are all necessary in the provision of pharmaceutical services and must be recognized from both an organizational and pay\u00ad ment -basis. In the interest of better patient care and fiscal integrity, the follow\u00ad ing guidelines are recommended: 1. ORGANIZATION OF PHARMAOEUTICAL SERVWES Organization of pharmaceutical services refers to the relationships which exist 'between the pharmacist and the facility as they jointly provide these services to the patient. In the organization of pharmaceu\u00ad tical services, the location of the pharmacy department (within or outside the facility) isa major factor. Currently, the most common approach to provlCting servic(\\ is through a community pharmacy. This service usually includes providing both the drug product and the related pharmaceutical service. If more than one pharmacy is pro\u00ad viding the drug product (prescription) in the facility, the drug prod\u00ad ucts and their use must be within the confines of the drug control (310) 311 system and are the responsibility of the pharmacist providing the ('on~ tractual pharmecutical service and must be accurately defined in his scope of responsibilities. \\\"hen the facility and the pharmacist defines the scope of pharma\u00ad ceutical service, they must include all aspects of drug control as defined by the various state and federal la'ws thereby promoting safe and effective drug therapy. Pharmaceutical services also encompass numer\u00ad ous activities such ItS the editing of the physicians original order, monitoring drug therapy and participating in the educational pro\u00ad gl'ams oithe facility. It is important to recognize that l)harmaceutical services like other professiona1 services, medical, nursing, dietary, etc., must be inte\u00ad grated into the total patient care l)rogram and IS the responsibility of the facility. The scope of services delineated in the POliCIes and proce\u00ad dures must 'be related to written agreement between the pharmacist and the facility. The services prOVIded by the pharmacist should be defined in written policies and procedures. Those facilities that provide an on-site pharmacy department may organize their pharmaceutical service in at least three ways. Fil'st, the pharmacy (fh.1;ures, inventOl~j1 and space) may remain in the owner\u00ad ship of the facility and the pliarmacist (or pharmacists) WhOpl'ovides service may be blllployec1 by the facility. Second, the pharmacy may be owned by the facility while the pharlllacist (or group of phannacists) provides services based on n. contractua.l agreement with the facility. Third, the facility may wish to rent space to a l)harmacist (or group of pharmacists) who would purchase fixtures 'and inventory. rn. this latter case, the pharmacist rather than the facility operates the phar\u00ad macy department. Recent innovatiom; in drug distribution systems such as unit close systems, might necessitate further refinement in the pharmacists scope of responsibilities -and his related reim'busement, however, the prin~ ciples Olttlined in this statement would still be applica,ble as to the rela\u00ad tionship between the facility and the pharmacist. A. PhaJ'1n.aceutical Se1'l)ice8.-The financial arrangement be,.. tween the pharmacist and the Nursing Home sllOuld be fully disclosed. B. Drug P?'oduct.-The fee for the, drug product has been and is tl'n.ditionally borne by the patient or third paTty payor. The financial arrangement between the, Pharmacist <and the Nursing Home should not increase the price of drugs to the 11 tient 01' thit'ct party payor above the cost for comparable drug servic(~ in the commtmity. SUMM:A,ny The intent of these guidinO' principles is to promote a basic under\u00ad standing of the relationship that should exist between pharmacists and long term care facilities. It is the hope that through sillch an understanding, the, quality of patient Care and fiscal integioity of all involved may 'be assured at the highest possible level. APPENHIX 6 ARTICLES FROM \"MODERN NURSING HOME,\" APRIL 1971 MEOIOATION PROCEDURES MUS1' CONFORllf 1'0 DRUG AnusE LAW (By Grover Bowles Jr.*) Tho comprehensive Drug .A.'buse Prevention ,and Control Act of 1D70 signed into law by President Nixon on Oct. 27, 1970, has been widely acclaimed in the lay J)l'ess as the most significant drug legislation yet passed. Although it lllcludes the controversial \"no knock\" provision, this complex law deals compassionately with first offenders and alIo\u00ad oates funds for education and research in drug abuse, and for the treatment and rehabilitation of addicts. However, of more significance to nursing home pharmacists are the provisions tightening record\u00ad keeping and the stiff penalties for violations. Title 2 of the act, dealing with control and enforcement, will be of special interest to pharmaCIsts. This section establishes five sehedules of controlled substances, sets forth definitions, spell out registration requirements, specifies which records and reports are reqUIred, and deals with violations and penalties. The five schedules or categories of controlled substances are: 1. Drugs such as LSD and heroin which have no ,accepted medical use but have a high potential for rubuse. 2. Drugs such as the opiates and other potent narcotics, including injectable methamphetalIllne, or \"speed,\" which have accepted medical uses but also lu\\..Ve high addiction potential. 3. Class B narcotlCs, amphetamines, some barbitul'flites, and other drugs with acce~)ted medical uses with less potential for abuse than those substances 111 schedule 2. 4. Drugs with accepted medical uses hut with low abuse potential such as meprobamate, phenoblll'bital and others. 5. Class X 01' exempt narcotics and othel' drugs with low abuse potenti'al and limited dependence. \u00b7When dispensed to patients, ch'ugs from schedules 2, 3 and 4 must bear a clear and concise warning that it is a crime to transfer the drng to any person other than the patient. The refill provisions, five times within six months for non-narcotic. drugs, remain the same 'as set forth in the Drug Abuse Amendm(mts of 196'5. VVhether nUl'sing homes will need to alter their record-keeping for ch'ugs subject to control will depend upon the adequacy of current records. Invoices, prescriptions, requisitions and other records for non\u00ad narcotic controlled drugs may be maintained separately or together with other records ns long as they are \"readily retrievable from the , ordinary business records or the I\u00b7egistrant.\" Because of the number of drug products involved uncI the rolume of activity, retrieval of \"Mr. Bowles Is director of Bnptlst lIIemorlnl bllSillt'SS l'(!col'tls of It uusy nursing home records for control drugs mn.y prove hurdensome. The effective elate of the law is May 1, 1071, Itt, which time a com\u00ad plete inventory of all controlled drugs must be taken, Thereafter, an lllVc.ntory every two years will be. l'equil'ed. As is now l'equil'cdl, all invoices, prescriptions, requisitions and other documents relatecL to the purchase, receipt and dispensing of controlled drugs must be kept for ttt least two yellrs. NEW TAUOE'l'S drugs from l'ecei ving and storl1ge areus, usually those drugs with high abuse potential, unfortunately do occur. Such thefts mn.y tn.ke place when dishonest employes work together or in collu\u00ad sion with family, friends 01' organized crime, and where money is the primary motive. Good stora~e facilities, propel' inventol'Y contl'oll'ecol'c1s, and wel1:\u00ad planned securIty measures minimize the wholesttle loss of drugs. How\u00ad ever, the abuse n.llcl mis,appl'oprintion of drugs by physicil1lls, pharma\u00ad cists, nurses, aides and other personllel who have easy access to drugs is much more difficult to detect and eradicate. This does not mean that lllll:sing homes have drug addicts by the dozens \u00b7among their em\u00ad ployes, but drug dependency occurs with sufficient :frequency among physicians, pha11.l1acists and nurses to bo cousiderecl an occupational hazard. \u00b7With the development of the ch'ug culture in our society, drng con\u00ad trol problems have shifted from the narcotics and medications with high alcoholic content to the amphetamines and othor stimulants, and to both the barbiturates nlldllonbarbitumte To lesser de\u00ad O'~'ee\\ Hewer synthetic analgesics nre now sotl~ht ~y those who experiment with and abuse drugs. The codeille-contalll~ ing cough preparations are also widely nbused, particularly among the lower income groups. Positive control of all drugs, not 1ust those with high abuse poten\u00ad tial, :is essential throughout the facihty. The unit dose mediCt1tion sys~ tem offers maximum protection against illicit diversion of drugs in patient arMS and eliminates the accumulation at the nursiuO' unit of large qnantities of drugs which then must be returned to tY1C phar\u00ad macy. The use of physician order forms that provide copies of medi\u00ad cation orders for the pharmacy minimizes the number of faked or\u00ad ders. Secure storage for all drugs is essential and only minimal sup\u00ad plies of drugs should be kept at lllu'sin~ stations and treatment areas. The distribution of drug samJ?les by p!larmaceutical representatives and by direct mail shoula be dlscouraged if not prohibited. The security force should be frunihal' with the procedures for re\u00ad ceiving and moving ch'ugs n,bout the facility and should make spot checks pel'iodically. Intrusion alarms and other devices should be used to safeguard the narcotics and mnjor supply of drugs in the pharmacy and storage areus. Security personnel should be on the lookout for discarded hypo\u00ad dermic syringes, empty cough sirup bottles, broken ampules, empty vials, and other medication containers in locker rooms, sti1il'wells, l'est-314 rooms and other llonpatient areas. These are telltale signs of. employe or visitor drug abuse. Steps should also be taken to sn.fegun.rd hypodermic syringes from theft~ and procedures for the used syringes should be est[l,blished [I,nd enforced. APPENDIX 7 LETTER FROM F. J.
