Not to be happy. Not to fall in love. Not to get the job of your dreams. If you want to lose weight to get healthier? Great. Just know that body size isn't the end-all, be-all of determining your health. Feeling good about your body and taking care of your body is the goal \u2014 and that can look like a lot of different things. But if you want to make some healthy changes to your diet or if you want to lose some weight, committing to a healthy eating plan can help. To help you get started, Cheryl Forberg, R.D. and Eliza Savage, R.D., designed this 7-day diet plan for weight loss. With this easy-to-follow plan, you're sure to feel refreshed, healthy, and strong, and lose weight (if you want to!) in no time. 7-Day Menu for Weight Loss This is not a restrictive meal plan: You'll eat three meals and two snacks daily, plus each dish packs a filling balance of macronutrients with 45 percent carbohydrates, 30 percent protein, and 25 percent healthy fats. When it comes to drinks, Forberg recommends sticking to no- and low-cal picks like coffee, tea, and water. And to accelerate weight loss and build a healthy and strong body, make sure you're getting the recommended amount of physical activity from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (that's 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity and two days of muscle strengthening activity, FYI).
