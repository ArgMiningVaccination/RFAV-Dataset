Megan Boysen Osborn, M.D., Associate Dean, Students: [mbo@hs.uci.edu](mailto:mbo@hs.uci.edu) The UCI Master of Science in Medical Science is designed to prepare the next generation of leaders in health care. Students obtain a strong foundation in anatomy and embryology, biochemistry, neuroscience, behavioral science, ethics, pathology, microbiology, and pharmacology. Students receive exposure to the health care setting and a strong foundation in interviewing and interacting with patients. The curriculum continues to meet the changing needs of medical education within the two years of instruction. Indeed, the School of Medicine faculty views curriculum development as a continual process and feels that medical education and teaching innovations must be encouraged and supported. The curriculum is designed to encourage medical students to become participants in their education process, to be active rather than passive learners, to become lifelong learners, and to use cooperative and team-learning principles. UCI is dedicated to the nurturing of humanistic, caring physicians and health care professionals with top-notch clinical expertise and skills. The School strives for this through a curriculum that is not only anchored in the science of medicine but also provides meaningful experiences in the humanistic dimensions of medicine. In this context, the faculty endeavors to provide students with experiences in areas such as communication and empathy, ethics and professionalism, diversity awareness, and cultural sensitivity and medical humanities. The faculty also feels that the curriculum should strive to integrate basic and clinical sciences by bringing substantial clinical material into this early phase of medical education. The School has achieved vertical integration of the curriculum with the development of a series of \"Clinical Foundations\" courses. The courses are longitudinal multidisciplinary experiences broadly designed to prepare students for their future careers in health care through the application of experiential and self-directed learning principles. These courses also utilize small group learning sessions to reinforce core concepts of patient-physician interactions and introductory clinical reasoning skill development. To satisfy the requirement for the M.S. in Medical Science degree, each medical student must successfully complete the first and second-year curriculum, elective(s) to complete a service learning project (SLP) elective. The SLP ensures that students seek knowledge to better serve the needs of the community, perform a community health assessment and intervention, and identify evidence-based strategies for providing health education to members of the community. Students must also pass a comprehensive oral examination prior to conferring of the degree. An ongoing academic monitoring program is coordinated by the Office of Student Support, which identifies students early who might be experiencing academic difficulty and provides them with resources to successfully complete their course work. Faculty advisors are assigned to students during their first and second years. A Learning Resources Program is available to provide tutorial assistance and study skills training. Graduates of the program will be prepared to use the foundation provided in this program towards a career health care (leadership, business, or research). For the degree, students must complete at least 142 units, consisting of the following courses: First Year: Clinical Foundations I Anatomy and Embryology Behavioral Science and Ethics 1 Histology Immunology Medical Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Medical Genetics Neuroscience Physiology and Pathophysiology Patient and Community Engagement I Second Year: Clinical Foundations II Behavioral Science and Ethics II Pathology Medical Microbiology Medical Pharmacology Patient and Community Engagement II Service-Learning Project Elective (12-24 units) Students earning the M.S. will complete a service-learning project. After or during completion of the required curriculum and SLP, students may be advanced to candidacy for the M.S. degree. Once they are a candidate for the M.S. degree, they will be required to pass a comprehensive examination. The exam will consist of a comprehensive oral examination (assessing knowledge of histology, immunology, medical genetics, neuroscience, pathology, microbiology, pharmacology, behavioral science and ethics, and/or gross anatomy and embryology). Students are required to be enrolled as a full-time student during advancement to candidacy and degree conferral for the M.S. degree.

There are over 6,000 ICU admissions per year, and fellows gain experience with core rotations in the SICU and elective experiences in the Neuro ICU, Burn ICU, Cardiovascular ICU, Pediatric ICU, and Medicine ICU. Extensive exposure to trauma resuscitation, operative management, emergency general surgery, and bedside ICU procedures is provided. Didactics include weekly core critical care lectures, case conferences, hands-on point of care ultrasound course, and Scientific American Surgical Critical Care program. Fellows attend a variety of educational courses sponsored by the American College of Surgeons including Advanced Surgical Skills Exposure in Trauma (ASSET), Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS), Basic Endovascular Skills for Trauma (BEST) and Disaster Management and Emergency Preparedness (DMEP). An optional second year is individually tailored to the needs of the fellow, and may include advanced experiences in trauma surgery, acute care surgery, quality and safety, and research in an environment with increased autonomy. Applications to the Surgical Critical Care program are accepted through the Surgical Critical care and Acute Care Surgery Fellowship Application Service (SAFAS). Applicants must be enrolled in, or board-certified/eligible graduates from, an ACGME-accredited surgical residency program. Urology - Urological Surgery The Department of Urology Residency Program is a five-year training program with three residents per year. The PGY 1 (internship) consists of six months of urology rotations and six months of non-urologic rotations including core general surgery rotations. The PGY 2-5 years provide training in all aspects of adult and pediatric urologic diseases. The residents receive extensive training in open and endoscopic procedures, laparoscopy and other minimally invasive techniques, urologic pathology, uroradiology, and management of non-operative urologic conditions. The program's training hospitals include UCI Medical Center, Veterans Affairs Long Beach Healthcare System, Long Beach Memorial Medical Center, and Children's Hospital of Orange County. The Department of Urology encourages and supports both clinical and basic science research. Urology - Pediatric The Pediatric Urology Fellowship program is a two-year ACGME accredited program, leading to qualification for the American Board of Urology's Subspecialty Certification in Pediatric Urology. This is a two-year fellowship, centered at the Children's Hospital of Orange County (CHOC) and UCI. Four Pediatric Urologists, faculty in the Department of Urology, oversee a full clinical program in which trainees are guided through all aspects of Pediatric Urology. One year is fully clinical, and a second year is split between clinical and research activities. Research projects may make full use of the robotic and surgical simulation and animal facilities at UCI. Collaborative meetings are regularly held within the Urology Department, in which the Fellows are encouraged to present materials and participate. In addition, there are many multidisciplinary meetings including radiology/nephrology rounds, Differences of Sexual Differentiation with endocrinology conference, tumor board, and other regular meetings at CHOC. The Pediatric Surgery team at UCI recently started a fellowship and the urology and surgery fellow each spend a month with the respective service to diversify their training. The entry to the Fellowship requires the completion of a recognized Urology residency, and the application is coordinated by the Society of Pediatric Urology matching program. "}
