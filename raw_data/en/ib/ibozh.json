In conjunction with the report to Congress, Dr. Patrick Conway, Acting CMS Principal Deputy Administrator, published a [blog post](https://blog.cms.gov/2017/01/05/transforming-health-care-delivery-through-the-cms-innovation-center/) on the CMS website, highlighting the CMMI. According to both the report and the blog post: - Over 30 new payment models have been launched over the past six years; - Investments in electronic medical records and a data and analytics infrastructure are sparking a new set of innovative companies; - The CMS Innovation Center's portfolio of models has attracted participation from a broad array of health care providers, states, payers, and other partners. An estimated 18 million individuals, including CMS beneficiaries and individuals with private insurance included in multi-payer models, have been impacted by, have received care, or will soon be receiving care furnished by more than 207,000 health care providers participating in CMS Innovation Center payment and service delivery models and initiatives. These models are delivering care to people in every state across the nation; - Medicare exceeded - earlier than predicted - the goal to tie more than 30 percent of fee-for-service payments by the end of 2016 through alternative payment models to quality and cost metrics. Medicare is on pace to reach 50 percent by the end of 2018. The future is also bright for CMMI, as there are several initiatives on the horizon, including: - The Medicare Diabetes Prevention Program expanded model, set to begin in 2018, will pay for services to prevent the onset of diabetes to all eligible Medicare beneficiaries, improving their health and that of the Medicare program both now and in the future. It is estimated that Medicare spent $42 billion in 2016 on fee-for-service, non-dual eligible, over age 65 beneficiaries with diabetes. - Three new payment models\u2014the Acute Myocardial Infarction Model, the Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Model, and the Cardiac Rehabilitation Incentive Payment Model\u2014will support clinicians in providing care to patients who receive treatment for heart attacks, heart surgery to bypass blocked coronary arteries, or cardiac rehabilitation. - Through the Comprehensive Primary Care Plus Model, primary care doctors can care for their patients the way they think will deliver the best outcomes, and they'll get paid for achieving results and improving care. - One new payment model\u2014the Surgical Hip and Femur Fracture Treatment Model\u2014will support clinicians in providing care to patients who undergo surgery after a hip or femur fracture beyond hip replacement. In addition, updates have been finalized to the Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement Model, which began in April 2016. - The Accountable Health Communities Model, beginning in 2017, will test whether increased awareness of and access to services addressing health-related social needs will impact total health care costs and improve health and quality of care for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries in selected communities. - Thirty-eight states and territories are engaged in the State Innovation Models initiative where they are testing their own best ideas to improve health, quality of care, and lower costs. Additionally, Vermont and Maryland have entered into global payment arrangements to improve care for the whole state's population. CMMI has recently announced more than five new or re-opened opportunities for clinicians to join Advanced Alternative Payment Models. CMS expects 125,000 to 250,000 clinicians to be participating in Advanced Alternative Payment Models by 2018. CMMI and CMS will continue to develop new payment models, guided by the following core principles: Supporting innovative payment and service delivery models with strong potential to improve health care quality and lower costs; engaging with and listening to consumers, providers, and other stakeholders allowing for open and transparent dialogue, including through the appropriate use of notice-and-comment rulemaking and ombudsmen; and evaluating results based on appropriately scoped and sized demonstrations and advancing best practices based on their impact on quality and cost.
