However, this can result in an imbalance between your work life and spiritual life. When this happens, we tend to become less efficient and less happy. Here are a couple of tips to help maintain that balance: Scheduling is Key In what often feels like 'the storm of work' there is a simple way to keep things organized- keep a schedule. It should be realistic and manageable. A daily or weekly schedule will work wonders in helping you find pockets of spiritual time. At work we often experience changes in project timelines or meetings. When this happens it's important to revisit your schedule to see where and when you can slot in some quiet meditation time. Utilize \"Free Time\" Although work demands many hours of the day, many of us are able to find some amount of free time. In the same way we find time to eat, we must become active in finding time to feed our Mind. One easy way is to start waking up a bit earlier or wrapping up tasks earlier in the evenings. Master Tip: Wake up early to get your day started when there are few distractions. Rise in the early hours of the morning, and take your cleansing bath. Before you go to bed at night, remember to worship the Lord. Know your Temple In the same way we visit our places of worship: Gurdwaras, Temples, Churches, Mosques, etc; remember that our Mind is also a temple, but it requires a custodian to maintain it. We work in this world to take care of the body, but maintaining a strong, healthy and distraction-free mind will propel us spiritually. Be the custodian that your Mind deserves and actively find time to continue on your spiritual journey. The mind is the temple, and the body is the fence built around it. True Occupation The occupation given to the Mind, is that of spiritual progress towards Naam. By chanting and meditating each second of the day we can learn to remain attuned with Naam, even while working. 6 While standing up, sitting down and sleeping, the Naam, says Nanak, is forever the occupation of God's humble servant. ||6|| As focused as we are in our worldly occupation, let's employ the same focus in our spiritual progress. After all, our identity isn't formed by the job we have, rather the quality of the thoughts our mind is occupied with. Let your pure mind be your identity, and spiritual progress be your occupation. Everything else will fall into place. "}
