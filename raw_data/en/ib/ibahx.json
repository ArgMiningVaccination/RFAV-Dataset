You are supported by a flexible daily schedule of options that can help lend structure to your stay. For example, in the morning you may choose from yoga or Qi Gong sessions, swimming, fitness, forest walks, meditation or prayers. Throughout the day there are further classes you can choose from and educational sessions you may wish to attend. Take into account your entire being - mentally, emotionally, physically and spiritually - and support those parts that you feel need further nourishment and attention. You can set an intention for the day - a short and positive statement that is like your guiding star throughout the day. Check in with yourself regularly to become aware of your wellbeing needs and to remember what you discussed with your Healing Guide. Reminding yourself of your positive intention is a gentle inner exercise helping you to stay focused. Before your breakfast, choose a morning activity that speaks out to you the most.

During your stay, you will find some of the most outstanding healing programs available around the world, and enjoy the fruits of the life-long practices and healing modalities of our expert practitioners. Your treatments are planned based on your needs and the results of your personal consultation session with the healing guide.

In one-on-one sessions, you can look at your life path and see where - often unconsciously - you block the beauty that is waiting to unfold in your life. Movement has many powerful benefits, not only for your body, but also for your mental health, as it releases stress, enhances your sleep and boosts your mood. The ecstasy of mountain walks, the smell of a forest after a fresh rainfall, an invigorating yoga session, the peace you find after a Qi Gong session, swimming in the ocean or a mountain lake. You name it...you find it...you choose it! This is the key to the long-lasting effects of your stay at a Healing Hotel. On your last day, you will meet again with your healing guide and discuss where you currently stand from a holistic point of view.

Euphoria evolved organically from a passion born out of Marina's personal path. Overcoming cancer in her late 20s, Marina was inspired by her own recovery to help others. She started to explore and study Traditional Chinese Medicine, The Five Elements and other alternative health methods and visited many healing centers and spas around the world. Eventually, she discovered her own Greek heritage. The ancient Greek philosophers viewed life as joyful, sensual and full of exciting potential for growth. The Greek word 'Euphoria' is about living and feeling 'well'. The magical Peloponnese was the perfect location for her vision: a peninsula rich in the myths and mysticism of Olympian gods and powerful heroes, a historical landscape that exudes a palpably healing energy rooted in ancient civilizations. Here, she created a world-class health retreat, that offers deep nurturing to restore guests to full health. The concept is based on the 'Euphoria Methodos', a Spa philosophy which converges varying healing philosophies and marries East and West, ancient Greek and Chinese health approaches and science with naturalism.

In 1989, he embarked on a mission to find a spiritual and serene location to create a destination spa and wellness retreat: \"When I came upon the Palace Estate of the Maharaja at Narendra Nagar, Tehri-Garhwal, overlooking Rishikesh and the Ganges river, I knew at once that this was the chosen place. Yoga and Ayurveda have their origins in these Himalayan foothills, and with inspiration from these ancient wellbeing and spiritual practices, Ananda in the Himalayas was born. I stuck to ancient Indian virtues, when people understood the balance of nature, the ways of the universe and how the elements affected, not just physical health, but also mental wellbeing. It was always clear to me, that if people achieved harmony within, they would be at peace. This is the very philosophy which brought Ananda in the Himalayas into being, believing that each "}
