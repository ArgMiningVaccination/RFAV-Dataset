A key component in healing terminal illness requires balance. The most important part of balance that many people forget is the need to give back. Yes, we need to receive, and we also need to return. This is vital when working with our sacred energy. In reality, we all want to be whole and complete, we all want to heal, we need to take in, but with a balance. Take in the many types of energy that are offered, love, compassion, support, and medications. Take all that positive energy in and accept it, but also give back. In order to truly heal, energy has to move both ways. Giving Back Give back, or as my adoptive native grandmothers called it, \"Giveaway.\" It can be as simple as sharing your enlightenment and loving intentions with others at every opportunity. You don't have to give away large monetary amounts, although charity is good at times. The best way I've found to giveaway and effect change in this world is to reach out to each other with greater understanding. When we do this, there comes greater acceptance and tolerance. Then we grow more universal love and compassion for each other. To reach out with an open heart to others is the most magnificent gift anyone can give. When we face our mortality, we face our hearts and soul. The truth that lives within our hearts, if shared with others, will touch them and stays with them forever. It becomes a part of their life and becomes a part of a quiet ministry. The essence of who we are never goes away. Who we are is just a part of everyone that was ever touched. Building Chi There is a life force in our body. Sometimes we hear it referred to as Chi or our charkas system. Energy flows through the body in multiple directions. We allow the life force to enter and exit just like our breath. We breathe in the four winds and utilize the oxygen we take from it, and then we release our manna, our breath back upon the winds. We are taking in and giving back at all times, and most of the time, we are unaware. Now let's build on this by including Spirit and all the divine creative consciousness of the universe. We begin by breathing in Spirit and the Universal All. We then use our hearts to work with this empowering energy that is pulsing in our lungs. Through our heart, we know our truth, and we can speak it upon the winds and let it be known. We are now sharing our Spirit and giving back to the divine creative consciousness of the universe. In this way, you strengthen your life force, your Chi. Allowing the energy to flow in and flow out just like breathing. The more you practice this simple discipline, allowing it to come into your heart and knowing your truth gives your life force balance. Set that intention in life that your breath is an interconnected component of the universal consciousness receiving and contributing energy. That way, we exchange all the time, every moment, even when we're sleeping. We process so much when we sleep. Bring that forth, and work with it. There might be a clue in our dreams or solutions to obstacles that we can overcome. I listen to my dreams and have used them to guide me with my healing. We have to cultivate the mind to work and listen to our heart. Growing up in this culture, we were taught to use our minds to make an income and rule our lives. Also, many of us, unfortunately, have been hurt at some point, and that made us want to shut down our hearts. But the heart is very strong. That is where the light of Spirit burns brightest. When we open our hearts with the light of Spirit, no one can touch that, and no one can hurt that. We need that Love and Light at full strength in order to overcome something like cancer. When the Mind and Heart are working together to form coherence, we achieve a higher level of balance. Alleviate Pain & Suffering Part of the physical and chemical therapies that we go through may cause us dread. Because they put us through so much anguish and pain, it creates suffering for our human side. We have to do what we can to alleviate the pain and maintain our mental clarity. One way to do this is through visualization, and another is through prayer. Prayer and visualization are both a way of giving our human side a ceremony. Ceremony allows the human side to release and let go of the mental suffering so Spirit can work and allow the build-up of the more positive aspects of our human side. My favorite prayer is also a nice way to give back, and I use it every morning when I wake. It is a gratitude prayer. Being thankful for what I am working on or the new understandings I have achieved. Simply being thankful for my life. It helps me start each day in balance and makes the day go smoother. In the healing process, balance is the most important part of the work. We have to keep that life force energy flowing in order to heal. Cancer Meditation Meditation is a discipline that works on many levels to help calm our human self and allow Spirit to give us insights we need to keep the positive attitude necessary in healing and beating cancer. Start out slowly at first, especially if you haven't meditated before. If you meditate on a regular basis, then this will be a simple exercise for you. Meditation should be an individual process for each of us, use this exercise as it feels right for you and add or subtract to your own comfort. Let's start by calming the mind, our human self. One way is by being grateful; give thanks for who and where you are, as well as all the support you have been given. Then try forgiving all the real and imagined wrongs that have hurt you. Continue with this until you feel yourself relaxing, then start the meditation. - Visualize all the negative thoughts and fears about your illness as a dark color. See the darkness from the pain and suffering from the disease being pulled up and out of the body. Continue with this until you feel yourself relaxing into a meditative state. Keeping mindful of your breath, breathe in comfort, and breathe out the tension. - Visualize your heart as a white and gold light. From within this light come millions of smaller light bubbles that are being sent out to dissolve the dark cancer cells and transform them into Love and Light. - Release this love and light back to the universe out of the top of your head and onto the four winds. - Remember to breathe in and breath out. - Now visualize your heart as a green color and pick a color green that brings you comfort. Send out the green light bubbles to heal the damaged cells left after the treatment. This is helpful for balance. - Again visualize the white and gold light. Now send it through the body for strength and courage. Slowly expand this light outside your physical body to form a shield or bubble of strength. - Slowly return to the room and open your eyes when ready.
