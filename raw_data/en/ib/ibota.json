[1](#ftn1) It refers to the traditional herbal medicine [2](#ftn2) commonly practised by M'ohi people, the indigenous population of French Polynesia. It can be prepared in a household or by certain specialists in the neighbourhood. While r'au m'ohi has been slowly disappearing from the more urbanised islands with the rise of biomedicine provided by the French state healthcare, the presence of this traditional alternative therapeutic tradition lingers on, to a greater or lesser extent, in the everyday lives of the indigenous population. 2In this article, I will demonstrate the context and impact of the recent resurgence of r'au m'ohi as it is appropriated by l'\u00c9glise protestante m'ohi (epm). The epm's theology seeks to enhance the bond between M'ohi people and their fenua (land), and they consider r'au m'ohi \u2014a plant-based medicine originating in the soil\u2014to be the sacred gift of God to M'ohi people. While still commonly practised in the private sphere as a set of home remedies, r'au m'ohi has also gained its place in the religious domain in the mid-2010s. Its practice in this context includes a demonstration of medicine preparation to the public, distribution of medicine to service attendees, and seminars on the theological significance of r'au m'ohi. - 3 R'au tahiti translates to \"medicine of which is inaccurate considering the widespread kno [(...)](#ftn3) 3I will approach this resurgence through the notions of \"efficacy\" and \"failure\". I illustrate how some aspects of the novel practice of r'au m'ohi [3](#ftn3) are seen as a misappropriation and a negligence of conventions by several M'ohi people, leading some to stress its \"failure\" to cure illness. While the definitions of \"failure\" and \"efficacy\" diversify as the practice of r'au m'ohi itself transforms, I argue that examining such definitions in different contexts illuminates the process of reappropriation and reconstruction of this traditional practice. Efficacy does not forcibly refer to the successful healing of an illness. It is rather used as a measure to evaluate what is acceptable in terms of the current indigenous cultural conventions. Specifically, I illustrate the coexistence and tension between what I refer to as \"theological efficacy\" and \"pragmatic efficacy\" by examining the \"failures\" of r'au m'ohi as they are identified by some of its traditional practitioners. 4All traditions are constantly exposed to change and improvisation as the condition of their continuing existence. However, indigenous traditions and customs have been particularly malleable to modification, if not exposed to the threat of discontinuity, due to the impact of colonialism and Western acculturalisation. The cultural revival movement across the Pacific since the 1970s attempted to bring back lost or disappearing indigenous traditions and knowledge within a contemporary, postcolonial context. As much as the resurgence of indigeneity is celebrated, it has also provoked a discussion of the notions of authenticity, continuity and discontinuity regarding cultural reconstruction as it is operated by indigenous and non-indigenous 1991). The authenticity of intangible cultural heritage such as dance and ritual remains controversial within the indigenous communities that practise them (Harkin, 1997). The impact of tourism and colonial assimilation policies have drastically changed the forms and ideas of indigenous cultural practices, which have pluralised internal values within indigenous communities (Bandyopadhyay and Yuwanond, 2018; Galla et al., 2015; Desmond, 1999). 5With regards to medical practice in the Pacific region, colonial intervention meant that indigenous forms of medical knowledge have been largely marginalised in the increasing dominance of state-endorsed biomedicine. Nevertheless, the persistence of traditional cosmology relating to illness is common in a variety of Polynesian and Melanesian societies. This can be due to purely pragmatic understanding of biomedicine, as receiving the benefit of biomedicine does not forcibly equal to belief in scientific understanding of a disease (Lepowsky, 1990). Even with a pathophysiological understanding, biomedicine still does not explain supernatural causes of illness such as sorceries and witchcraft (Lemaitre 1885; Feinberg, 1990; Evans-Pritchard, 1937). The establishment of medical facilities such as hospitals also created a new dichotomy between 'tradition' and 'modernity', with indigenous medical cosmology belonging to the former and biomedicine the latter (Street, 2014). Furthermore, the colonial installation of modernity in medical form could also be taken as 'indirect attacks on their integrity as a people on their collective worth' (Howard, 1979: 273) and rather enhance the need for validifying traditional medicine as its counterpart. - 4 Mono'i is a coconut-based oil traditionally used for a variety of purposes in French Polynesia, as [(...)](#ftn4) 6All these remarks also explain the persistence of r'au m'ohi in French Polynesia today, despite free access to biomedicine and its increasing dominance. R'au m'ohi's anti-colonial resurgence frames it as \"an ethnic tradition\" and \"a superior set of medical knowledge to biomedicine\" simultaneously. This re-evaluation of r'au m'ohi, however, does not necessarily boost its validity or \"efficacy\", as I would investigate in this paper. Rather, it pluralises the practising contexts of r'au m'ohi and evokes an internal debate within the indigenous community as to what qualifies as \"effective\" r'au m'ohi. Similar to how commercialisation of monoi [4](#ftn4) as a contemporary commodity raises questions of cultural authenticity (Stevens, 2018), and like other traditional practices in colonial societies, the authenticity of r'au m'ohi is also exposed to the diversifying conventions. Its claimed \"efficacy\" can be an effective lens through which we examine the transmission and transformation of this localised knowledge. 7Measuring the efficacy of a medical treatment, particularly in traditional medicine, is not simple. Many scholars point out the methodological and conceptual disparities in defining efficacy, especially compared to biomedicine. \"Curing\" generally indicates treatment in which the malfunctioning target area of the body is repaired to the previous state. In such a case where the negotiation of primarily material substances is at stake, the efficacy of a treatment is a visible outcome and can be empirically tested. \"Healing\", on the other hand, refers more to the \"broader psychosocial process of repairing the affective, social, and spiritual dimensions of ill health or illness\" (Waldram, 2000: 604). The goal of a healing treatment can be thus diverse depending on cases, and so is the definition of efficacy. In some cases, a successful treatment does not equal to the physical removal of the malfunction but to the subjective opinion of the patient (McGuire, 1991). Efficacy can be seen as \"the ability to purposively affect the real world in some observable way, to bring about the kinds of results that the actors anticipate will be brought about\" (Young, 1976: 7). More simply put, it is \"the expectation of the people served\" (Foster, 1978: 125). Those expectations can vary depending on individuals, specific social and cultural circumstances and medical systems. 8In fact, such an expectation itself is an essential condition for an \"effective\" treatment for r'au m'ohi as well as for many esoteric practices. Focusing on the collective aspect of magic, Marcel Mauss (1972) claims that efficacy entirely depends on the beliefs of a social group. Such belief is often established by the power of cultural symbols and protocols. In the theory of \"the effectiveness of symbols\", L\u00e9vi-Strauss (1977) demonstrates the crucial role of symbol and convention in a shamanic ritual of facilitating difficult childbirth. He argues that the ancient song that a shaman performs during childbirth \"constitutes a psychological manipulation of the sick organ and it is precisely from this manipulation that a cure is expected\" (ibid.: 192). All agents involved in the process (the patient, the healer and the audience) must participate in the collective belief in the power of ritual for the success of the treatment. 9When different factors combine to produce the desired efficacy, it is difficult to specify the role played by each factor in the treatment processwhether it is a biomedical, social, symbolic, or psychological factor. R'au m'ohi can be simply categorised as a herbal medicine, yet its efficacy is beyond pharmacological compositions of plants. It is based on the combination of trust, belief, protocols and biomedical reactions, and it is not my aim to single out one of them for what enables its efficacy. Rather, efficacy is \"a measurement of micropolitical power, biopsychosocial effects, and cultural affect\" (Craig, 2012: 7). Considering all agents involved in the transient and unique process, efficacy is \"fluid and shifting, the product of a negotiated, but not necessarily shared, understanding by those involved in the sickness episode, including physicians/healers, patients, and members of the community.\" (Waldram, 2000: 603) 10Pursuit of efficacy can thus highlight the cultural web of multiple components in the specific medical system. 11I argue that the concept of failure is an \"effective\" scope to explore the meanings of efficacy and its conditions in specific cultural systems. Traditional medicine as well as biomedicine must contain failure due to their empirical and statistical significance and can thus be \"rationalized in a way that deflects a challenge to the legitimacy of the system itself\" (Waldram, 2000: 610). Failure in curing an illness does not necessarily equates to the failure of the treatment. Thus, in order to understand the meanings of efficacy, we need to understand the meanings of failure. In r'au m'ohi, efficacy of treatment is described as manuia (success), while failure is expressed as aita e manuia (non-success). In order to scrutinise the efficacy of this medical system, it is equally essential to understand the absence of efficacy, that is, failure. 12The concept of failure itself is not new to anthropology. Ritual studies, for example, have discussed ritual failure since the rise of the discipline. More recently, however, Grimes (1990) has suggested a typology of performative infelicities which lists the myriad ways in which a ritual can be inappropriately performed, thus ending up being ineffective or demeaning. He also mentions \"ineffectuality\", \"the procedures that fail to bring about intended observable changes\" (ibid: 286), which could occur even if the ritual itself is properly performed. Pointing out the obscurity in defining \"failure\" in Grime's typology, Schieffelin (2007) argues that ritual can fail either in its \"process\" or \"result\". In other words, one can say a ritual failed because there was an error in the procedure (even if the ritual achieved the desired outcome) or it failed because it did not bring about the expected result. 13However, few studies primarily focus on failure in traditional medical systems. By identifying the reasons that supposedly lead to the failure of a treatment, it is not my aim to claim that these are the only factors at stake in achieving efficacy or resulting in failure. There are other aspects of traditional medicine at play \u2014such as pharmacological or biopsychological ones\u2014, which I regrettably do not have the space to explore here. However, the discourse of failure certainly highlights the significance of cultural symbols and social relations in achieving efficacy. It can illuminate what efficacy means in different contexts, and further, the hierarchical significance of cultural protocols in achieving a culturally and circumstantially specific efficacy. In this paper, I will highlight M'ohi people's narratives regarding the failure of r'au m'ohi. In doing so, I aim to stress the coexistence of different \"efficacies\" which are respectively associated with traditional and more recent practices of r'au m'ohi. 14This paper is based on a ten-month period of fieldwork that was conducted in 2019 and 2020 in Moorea and Rurutu island. I have visited r'au practitioners, specialists and other ordinary people, observed the r'au preparation, and collected narratives of the healers and patients alike. In the rural island of Rurutu where biomedical facilities are more limited than in Tahiti or Moorea, the population is much more likely to turn to r'au m'ohi than to biomedicine. I have interviewed local traditional healers and attended r'au-related events organised by the epm in Moorea, where the practice of r'au m'ohi is declining due to recent urbanisation. I conducted interviews with local deacons and members of the Committee of R'au M'ohi (Te Tomite R'au M'ohi) in the parish of Maatea to investigate the place r'au holds in Christian theology, as well as their religious practice of r'au m'ohi within and outside of the parish. Most of the interviews cited in this paper were conducted in Tahitian with r'au practitioners on Moorea island. Finally, I have tested several r'au m'ohi for myself, following the protocols of the healers who prescribed the medicine to me, the medicine proving to be \"effective\" in relieving my dysmenorrhea and coughing. - 5 As for other forms of traditional medicine, there are also massage, bloodletting and exorcism (see [(...)](#ftn5) 15If you see a woman carefully collecting leaves and plants from her garden, or if she visits neighbours to ask for certain plants, she probably has r'au making on her agenda for the day. She would need several ingredients, which she takes back home and processes into paste, liquid or steam, depending on the medicine. Considering the fact that the local medicine practised in French Polynesia is largely plant-based, [5](#ftn5) it is not surprising that \"r'au\", in Tahitian, means \"tree\" and \"medicine\" at the same time. Different parts of the plants are applied for the making of r'au m'ohi: entire plants (tumu), young sprouts grains (huero) (P\u00e9tard and Florence, 1986). Fruits and leaves are sometimes distinguished according to their development stages from green, or ripe, to rotten.

In terms of the categories of patients, there are formulae practised only for babies and children, and others for elderly people, or for women. There are also r'au to cure already manifested illness (such as diarrhoea, ear discharge, vision loss, infection etc.) and those that are regularly taken as preventive treatment. There are oral medicines in liquid form (r'au inu), topical medicines that are directly applied to the skin (r'au parai), and bathing medicineswhose steam is inhaled while bathing in it (r'au hapu). Despite the large variety of r'au, there are some very common formulae most widely practised as home remedies, such as r'au he'a (for menstrual the'e (for detoxication). R'au are most commonly referred to by its functions or the symptoms they are supposed to cure, and rarely called by its ingredients. In fact, even the ingredients for the most common r'au sorts are highly variable depending on practitioners. [6](#ftn6) This diversity itself is worthy of a separate pharmacological investigation into whether certain ingredients demonstrate particular efficacy for the aimed illness. In this paper, however, I use the M'ohi categorisation of r'au in order to highlight the efficacy and failure achieved by the external and relational elements. 17Most r'au m'ohi is taken for three consecutive days or occasionally for two days. Except for some food restrictions (m'a 'pani), there is no noticeable change in the patient's lifestyle. However, r'au is often not supposed to be taken for longer than three days at a time. Purges are an important element in the healing process of r'au m'ohi. This is because the effect of r'au does not manifest immediately, and it can take up to one month until the patient knows whether the healing has been successful. The purges thus also have the function of preventing an overdose of certain substances from the r'au, in case it proves to be effective later. They also allow a pause to determine whether the r'au is appropriate for the patient. Unlike traditional Chinese medicine or biomedicine that can be personalised to individual patients' conditions, the formulae and dose of r'au are usually fixed and unmodified. After the purge, there are cases in which r'au does not \"succeed\" (manuia) for certain individuals, in which case the treatment ceases. 18There is no clear line between whom I refer to as r'au specialists and r'au practitioners. Some women are reputed healers in their community and receive patients external to their immediate families. However, r'au is also frequently prepared by a non-specialist in a household. The majority of households would have at least one person who is knowledgeable about basic r'au preparation, such as r'au fati for sprains in legs or feet, r'au he'a for a regular menstruation cycle and reducing dysmenorrhea, and r'au iri for convulsion in infants and children. Preparation is not strictly restricted to women, but in practice they often are in charge. This is because women tend to remain home to take care of the household according to the traditional gender roles, while men would be absent during the day for work. The majority of reputed healers are women because they are supposed to be available to patients who spontaneously visit their houses to ask them for r'au. 19The most extensive, encyclopaedic database of r'au m'ohi is the work of Paul les plants utiles de Polyn\u00e9sie et R'au Tahiti (P\u00e9tard and Florence, 1986), of which a new edition has been published in 2019. The volume covers numerous medicinal plants, their detailed description and biological data, and preparation methods. A more recent publication by Girardi et al. (2015) introduces the traditional medical practices in Marquises islands as a unique geographical and cultural area to Tahiti. As an ethnopharmacological study over several years, it has a comprehensive list of 77 plant species, their uses, methods of preparation, and the associated traditional nosology. Whistler (2015) also provides a list of over 600 spices of Tahitian plant names and their descriptions. 20Although the above studies boast a significant amount of accurate botanical data, they primarily focus on the herbal aspect of the ethnomedicine. In contrast, some anthropologists viewed r'au as part of a larger cultural practice concerning illness and healing. Lemaitre (1885) distinguishes ma'i mau (the real illness) and ma'i tapiri (illness caused by the supernatural) and provides a comprehensive picture of Polynesian healing practices. A local anthropologist Simone Grand (2007) further elaborates the role of tahu'a in healing illness caused by sorceries and evil spirits, providing numerous episodes of healers. Henry's (1999) dissertation primarily focuses on the contemporary practice of r'au m'ohi as an effective alternative to biomedical state care. Their studies address non-biomedical elements of r'au m'ohi such as the role of healers, disease etymology and political implications. Building on their work with a particular focus on herbal medicine, I argue that the whole healing system of r'au does not consist solely of the reaction between medication and the target area of the body, it is also realised by establishing social relations between the healer and the patient, or spiritual relation between God and humans. As the field of medical anthropology enunciates that \"healing requires a legitimated, credible and culturally appropriate system\" (Blaxter, 2004: 43), examination on the local meaning-bound system is essential in assessing the efficacy of a treatment. - 7 The receipt of money or any goods as the price for r'au is not accepted. It is assumed that the he [(...)](#ftn7) 21As it is the case for all cultural phenomena, r'au m'ohi too is constantly subjected to adjustment and reconstruction along with the social change that Polynesian society has undergone. The new dietary habit based on inexpensive, imported products caused both new diseases and the adjustment of r'au to treat them. The monetised economy made some urban practitioners see r'au as a business opportunity, selling it to their patients or a wider public in the market. [7](#ftn7) In the face of modernisation, lifestyle change and increasing access to biomedicine, r'au m'ohi also adopted to serve people in the contemporary contexts before the revitalisation by the epm in the mid-2010s. - 8 While many marae (ancient temples) have been destroyed and abandoned in French Polynesia, some have [(...)](#ftn8) 22Particularly, the cultural movement in Tahiti regarded r'au m'ohi as part of the indigenous cultural heritage to be protected and reclaimed. Indigenous cultural revival movement is a post-colonial phenomenon that promotes and reclaims the pre-colonial Polynesian cultural and religious heritage as an expression of resistance. This type of movement is widely recognised in the whole Pacific region, particularly since the 1970s. Despite politically remaining an overseas collectivity of France, Tahiti was no exception to the collective post-colonial climate experienced throughout the Pacific. As one of the earliest examples, the Pouvanaa Oopa movement in the 1950s attempted the institutionalisation of Polynesian traditions, one of whose largest projects was the recreation of Marae Arahuahu [8](#ftn8) in 1954 (Saura and Gobrait, 2013). Heiva, the annual competition for a variety of cultural arts such as dance and singing that has been celebrated since 1881, became the main space of expression for the \"neo-traditional cultural identity\" today (Henry, 1999: 214). The movement covered a variety of cultural domains such as dance, music, tattooing, arts and crafts, language, etc. (Saura, 2009; Stevenson, 1992). This mood of cultural revival certainly provided the foundation to culturally validate r'au m'ohi. 23The government ban on r'au m'ohi since the early colonial days strictly limited the traditional healing to the private domain. While mono'i (coconut-based oil) has been marketed as a traditional cosmetic product as early as in the 1940s (Stevens, 2018), The value of the herbal medicine was only publicly recognised in the1970s. In 1980, the district of Papeete sponsored and organised an exhibition \"Tahiti aux temps anciens\", in which they demonstrated various Polynesian traditions, including r'au m'ohi. Traditional healing is also honoured and exhibited at the annual three-day exhibition at the Territorial Assembly. They provide traditional massage therapy and oral medicine to those who are in need. It provided \"a venue to let the public become familiar with the system of healing in an open environment\" and a space \"for discussion, collaboration and education about the Tahitian system of healing for all Territorial residents\" (Henry, 1999: 220). Although the state medical care does not legally support or incorporate r'au m'ohi, state-hosted exhibitions and healers' associations exist to promote a wider recognition and practice of r'au m'ohi as an important indigenous practice. 24Biomedicine has been growing as a more dominant choice, especially after 30 years of French nuclear testing drastically changed the socio-economic structure of the territory in the 1960s. cps (Caisse de pr\u00e9voyance sociale) provides biomedical care without the barrier of cost since 1979, which increased the number of people who are in favour of biomedicine as their first choice. Many r'au practitioners, household healers and specialists alike, stated that they make r'au less frequently or have fewer patients who consult with them compared to the past. Uramaru is a well-known healer in the village quarter. She said that she could \"never rest and have enough sleep at night\" when she used to have someone come almost every day for her r'au. \"People kept coming because they hear a good reputation about my r'au from my existing patients, and that's how I got more and more people coming.\" 25Now she receives about five or six people per month, and she thinks that the rest prefer to turn to r'au popa', the Westerners' medicine. However, she does not think that r'au will cease to exist in the future. All the other practitioners of Maatea too, consider that r'au m'ohi performs efficacy that cannot be achieved by biomedicine. 26While the state considers r'au m'ohi as a cultural heritage rather than a legitimate medical alternative, the revitalisation by \u00c9glise protestante m'ohi (epm) reveals another dimension of r'au m'ohi; namely, its religious significance. The importance of the Christian faith is already mentioned as the necessary element to achieve the desired effect of r'au m'ohi (Henry, 1999). However, the epm theology further elaborates the religious aspect of traditional healing. 27The epm's forebearer is the London Missionary Society, a British congregational group whose missionaries were the first to land in Tahiti in 1797. After being under the control of British and then French missionaries (Paris Evangelical Missionary Society), the \u00c9glise \u00e9vang\u00e9lique de Polyn\u00e9sie fran\u00e7aise gained autonomy in 1962, before changing its name to \u00c9glise protestante m'ohi (epm) in 2004. After the epm's independence, its president, a local intellectual called Duro Raapoto, led a new development of its theology. Raapoto's theology was a promoter of M'ohi indigenous identity. Fenua (land) is considered as the central element of the epm theology, for the land is God's direct medium to its people. Saura (2009) points out that this \"sacralisation of the land\" is supported by anti-colonial (and for some, pro-independence) sentiments. By adding the religious value to the land, it indirectly criticises the colonialism that stole the land, the sacred medium between God and its people. Fenua is a \"door to the heaven\" ('puta o te ra'i), where the divine vitality flourishes and blesses its residents. Deriving from the sacrality of the land, they also consider that all M'ohi traditional cultural practices, such as traditional agriculture, cooking and eating traditional food, art craft, and finally, r'au m'ohi, are the medium to reach the Divinity (Fer and Malogne-Fer, 2000; Malogne-Fer, 2016). - 9 In Entre nature et culture : la mise en terre du placenta en Polyn\u00e9sie fran\u00e7aise, Saura (2003) expl [(...)](#ftn9) - 10 They do not only use indigenous plant species to compound r'au. In fact, many plants for r'au m' [(...)](#ftn10) 28In the M'ohi world, the typical Western nature-culture divide is undermined. As observed frequently in many other non-Western societies, M'ohi culture is an art of living with nature (Saura, 2009; Saura, 2003; Levy, 1975; Henry, 1962) Their cultural practices are often deeply rooted in the natural environment and thus always manifest connections to the land. [9](#ftn9) For instance, r'au m'ohi uses local plants [10](#ftn10) as direct products of fenua. As fenua is a divine existence, the nourishing mother (te metua vahine fa'atupu ora) as they say, its vegetation is also considered a blessing from God. The efficacy of r'au m'ohi is thus not only generated due to physical reactions between substances but also stemmed from the divine power that is channelled through fenua. 29The undercurrent of this \"fenua\" theology is the same sentiment that motivated the cultural renaissance. The colonial administration and Western acculturation put their ethnic and cultural identity under threat of disappearance, which caused the fear of losing traditional cultural practices and their M'ohi identity. At a lecture I attended in March 2019 on r'au m'ohi, many participants expressed concern over the dissipating custom. \"We no longer know the names of our native plants, or how to prepare them into r'au,\" one participant voiced his opinion. \"We were taught by our parents, but we didn't pay attention, because we no longer value such knowledge.\" Another participant stated that they are now too used to (matau) biomedicine, as there is no barrier to state care. The discussion ended with a remark that they must \"recognise where they come from\" and \"accept their M'ohiness\" (M'ohiraa) fenua and its such r'au m'ohi. 30In the discourse of \"returning to fenua\", there appears a tension between M'ohi (indigenous) vs. Popa' (white). In such an ethnically dichotomous view, the epm encourages M'ohi people to cherish \"Maohiness\" over its foreign counterpart; the Tahitian language over French, fish and taro over steak frites, and local over global. Without doubt, biomedicine (r'au popa') belongs to the \"French\" category as opposed to r'au m'ohi. While the population benefits from free access to biomedical treatment, the spread of biomedicine also deprived them of the indigenous knowledge of healing. 31R'au m'ohi is thus not only the means of curing illness but a domain of resistance against colonialism and the following modernisation and social change. As much as r'au itself is \"part of the continuous process of social change\" (Henry, 1999: 20), it is simultaneously \"an idiom to express Tahitian cultural solidarity against the threat posed by French influences and to address anxieties caused by the French presence\" (Clark, 1993: 181). As Howard (1979) notes in his observation of the Rotuman healing practice in Papua New Guinea, effectiveness in traditional medicine is \"the ultimate cultural justification for any cultural tradition\" (ibid.: 244), especially for those whose cultural and spiritual heritage is denied by secular political powers of colonial administrations. - 11 A person who is knowledgeable of the topic and leads the discussion. An animator. 32In a larger scheme of \"returning to the land\" advocated in the epm theology, church members reminisce about the traditional lifestyle of their ancestors. They seek to return to a time when their life was not yet invaded by modern goods and the capitalist economy, the time when the local kinship-based community sustained collective agricultural life and when the religious authority consolidated the parish members. The resurgence of r'au m'ohi also demonstrates its association with this ethnic past. \"The first-ever pharmacy (fare r'au) that we had was our land itself,\" rauti [11](#ftn11) of the r'au m'ohi lecture spoke. \"Our ancestors recognised life within fenua, and that's how they knew preparation of r'au. We must re-learn to accept the godly love in our own land, and that's what we do when we prepare and take r'au in our bodies.\" 33Engagement with r'au m'ohi is a channel to the land, the ancestral past, and the Divinity. 34The epm's Committee of R'au M'ohi (Te Tomite R'au M'ohi) was founded in 2015 to promote the knowledge and practice of r'au m'ohi. Some theological leaders started the movement in Moorea, where the epm's most indigenous-asserting parishes are located. Since the establishment of the Committee was approved by the epm's headquarter, they have been active mostly in Tahiti and Moorea, the two most urbanised islands of French Polynesia. Their activities are based on the idea that the revival and recognition of the traditional healing is a religious necessity of M'ohi people as well as a medical one. 35In the parish of Maatea, some r'au experts of the area became committee members to support various activities that happen rather irregularly. I have attended lectures on the religious significance of r'au m'ohi, r'au preparation workshops, and r'au offering for religious services. Lectures on r'au include organised discussions in small groups on themes concerning r'au m'ohi and its current practices, such as its theological significance and decline of the practice. In r'au preparation workshops, r'au specialists demonstrate preparations of r'au to the public. In events involving U'i-'p (youth) and children, they also prepare the ingredients for them to learn making r'au themselves. Photo 2. - Raau-making workshop organised by the of R'au M'ohi, 2018, Tahiti (clich\u00e9 Mai Misaki) 36The most innovative practice by the epm is probably the serving of r'au m'ohi to service attendees. R'au in the liquid form is distributed in shot glasses and offered on a large tray. In entering the prayer hall, if not as the Eucharist replacing wine, thus the blood of Christ, each person takes a glass and drinks it. What differentiates this mass-distribution the most from more conventional practices of r'au m'ohi is the unique idea of efficacy associated to it. Instead of viewing r'au m'ohi as an alternative to biomedicine of which purpose is to cure illness, the Committee emphasises its religious significance. R'au is considered a physical manifestation of God's love to M'ohi people. Thus the incorporation of r'au m'ohi symbolises the union between one and the Divine. I shall call this \"theological efficacy\", as it does not aim to achieve a pragmatic goal, but is an embodiment of the epm theology. 37R'au m'ohi consumed for a wider public tends to be the most common, harmless kind that is often taken as a disease prevention method or a home remedy. Instead of a specific medicine for a specific illness condition, they often prepare a type of r'au m'ohi called r'au tahe'e. While r'au tahe'e can also vary significantly in its ingredients, it is known for having a detox function and can be taken by the sick and healthy alike. Nevertheless, the making and consumption of r'au m'ohi organized by the epm for the general public represents a significantly different context of practice compared to the more conventional practice of healing performed in the private sphere, leading to controversy and debate between the parishioners as to what it means for r'au m'ohi to \"succeed\" or \"fail\". \"I don't have problems with the demonstration of r'au preparation to the general public.The only thing I have an issue with is the serving of r'au at the religious services,\" 38Ranitea confessed as she gave me her opinion on the recent resurgence of r'au m'ohi at the church. Since her mother taught her r'au preparation at an early age, she has been serving the community with her healing skills. Her family house stands surrounded by all she needs for her r'au recipes, from a tree of r'au tou next to the garage to a bush of moemoe that squeezes out of the asphalt ground of their open-air kitchen. \"I believe in God and His power to heal through r'au\u2014I share the idea with them. But I don't agree that r'au puaroto, or whatever they make, should be distributed like that. That's just... not what you do.\" 39Like other r'au specialists, Ranitea has always seen her patients in person, heard their illness episodes, accordingly prescribed r'au and communicated with them about the course of the healing. A Christian organisation seems to be an ideologically appropriate space to preach the theological significance of r'au m'ohi. However, the new context for r'au practice is also met with disagreement. 40Some M'ohi people consider that certain cultural protocols are indispensable for the \"success\" (manuia) and efficacy of r'au m'ohi as a healing practice. This efficacy can be seen as \"pragmatic efficacy\", for r'au m'ohi is seen as a pragmatic means to cure an illness. In other words, if r'au or any of its constituent parts is deficient, it will fail and the illness will remain unhealed. Healing practices in the newly developed context can sometimes pose a question to their efficacy, as they do not necessarily comply with the conventional protocols nor have a specific illness to cure. In this section, I illustrate most frequently claimed protocols of r'au m'ohi and how the new practices at epm challenge or undermine some of them, and is thus called \"ineffective\" ('aita e manuia). 41Interviews with r'au practitioners and specialists in Rurutu and Moorea revealed that there is significant diversity in their protocols and ingredients. Some insist that r'au must be made only in the mornings, while others say they do it anytime except for Sundays. Some keep the recipe in their old, stained notebooks (puta r'au) and others say that they must correctly memorise them all. Some are willing to share their recipes and others keep them as family secrets. As for ingredients, the same r'au (r'au he'a or r'au fati, for example) can contain different plant species depending on those who prepare them. The protocols that the patients should follow also vary equally. 42However, there are also some specific conditions that both Rurutu and Moorea islanders claimed as essential for r'au to succeed. Those rules are fairly consistent among the practitioners whom I interviewed, albeit Rurutu being more rural and traditional than Moorea. For example, belief (ti'aturira'a) is an essential element in healing that largely influences r'au's effect. This belief concerns multiple agents involved in the process; both the healer (the creator of r'au) and the receiver must believe in the efficacy of r'au in resolving the problem. The stronger the belief is, the more effective the treatment becomes. Specialists must be positively motivated ('ana'anatae) and not feeling dull or lazy (fiu) when making r'au (Lemaitre 1885), but the amplitude of efficacy also often depends on the receiver's disposition. Many specialists report that those who are \"just trying\" with a purely pragmatic attitude would not be capable of unlocking the potential of r'au m'ohi. Some turn to r'au m'ohi because a biomedical treatment failed to cure their illness, but still with a degree of scepticism. \"You have to be serious about it,\" a Rurutu mother once told me on the way to meet a local specialist of r'au m'ohi. \"You have to tell yourself that it will certainly work. If you can't make yourself believe that, it's not even worth trying.\" 43Her baby had recurring rashes on his scalp. After consulting a specialist who compounds r'au for infants and children, the rashes disappeared within a few days. - 12 The vast majority of the indigenous population of French Polynesia associate themselves with the Ch [(...)](#ftn12) 44Many r'au specialists also associate belief in r'au with belief in God. This is where the practice of traditional medicine imbricates with the Christian faith. This idea is not new to the epm theology but commonly believed by r'au practitioners, who are all Christians of different denominations. [12](#ftn12) Faith and prayers are the ultimate solution for an illness (Lemaitre, 1885), and believing in the capacity of r'au simultaneously means believing in God's power in curing the illness. This is also how epm incorporated r'au m'ohi in their theological discourse without any ideological barrier. \"In the making of r'au, its force comes from your gut,\" one of the members of the Committee of R'au M'ohi, Teariivahine tells. \"You cannot just copy the manners. Your whole self and your faith go into r'au. The faith in God first of all, and the faith in the success of the r'au. Because God gives all these plants that make r'au. All the creations are given by God.\" 45However, r'au distribution at some of the epm parishes neglects the most basic protocols that normally accompany r'au m'ohi. For instance, dietary restrictions (m'a 'pani) are often considered as essential conditions for the r'au treatment to be successful. The food that is prohibited during the healing process varies depending on the prescription of r'au, yet the majority of r'au could not be combined with canned food (m'a punu), pelagic fish (i'a tua), fried food, meat, carbonated drinks or cold water. These restrictions must be followed for one or two weeks after the first three days during which r'au has been taken, or depending on the practitioners' decision regarding the duration of the cessation (ha'apaera'a). Some say this should last for at least one to two months, while others insist that one should refrain from those foods for as long as possible. 46Biomedicine (r'au popa') is in a similar position to canned corned beef. All practitioners agree that traditional medicine and biomedicine could never be combined to heal illness. The preservatives contained in canned food or unknown chemical substances in biomedicine could incur the risk of producing an unsought compound, which leaves undesired side effects. There has never been an attempt to create a healing scheme in which traditional and Western medicine are combined, for they should not seek assistance from r'au m'ohi and biomedicine simultaneously. It is common that they turn to one and then to the other if the first attempt fails and the illness remains uncured but a parallel consumption is advised against by both biomedical doctors and r'au practitioners. Some r'au practitioners even suggest taking r'au the'e to eliminate the residual substances from the body in addition to the r'au m'ohi that cures the illness itself. 47Although not all r'au sorts are accompanied by dietary or medical restrictions, the majority of r'au is prescribed with some constraint. The public serving of r'au to many unspecified attendees does not consider these restrictions, which causes disagreement within the community. Angelique, an experienced r'au practitioner of the quarter corned beef, pelagic fish...those are m'a 'pani. People need to respect the taboo. If you don't respect the protocols, why would you want to take r'au in the first place? Only you can take care of yourself by following rules. If you seek death, that's up to you. If not, you should refrain from consuming those products for three days of r'au taking and the following three days.\" 48Not only her, but many people stress the necessity of m'a 'pani, albeit with slightly varying details of the restrictions. 49Some epm events where r'au is distributed as a M'ohi gesture of hospitality (aroha), such as religious services, committee meetings and synods, are accompanied by a meal. The genre of food varies depending on the groups of church members who are responsible for meal preparation. It can be m'a m'ohi (traditional Polynesian food such as fish, taro, manioc, fafaru, etc.), m'a tinito (Polynesian-Chinese food), or m'a popa' food such as steak, corned beef, chicken, chips, lentil soup, stew, etc.). Unless they serve traditional Polynesian food that does not contain pelagic fish, the meal would involve typical m'a 'pani, such as fried chicken, chips, corned beef, canned beans and peas. Those who value the food taboo are disturbed by the thought that the distributed r'au might come into conflict with the food that is served immediately after the intake of r'au. 50For more \"conventional\" r'au practices, neglect of the protocols leads to a failure that is obvious to all parties involved. It simply means that the r'au fails to cure the illness that was first claimed by the recipient. Not only that, but failure also carries a potential for grave consequences. This is based on the fact that the healing system involves three physical agents: the healer, r'au, and the receiver. Each entity is physically separate from the others but still influencing each other. 51For instance, experienced healers would know if a recipient of their r'au has not followed the protocols, even without seeing them in person. A r'au specialist Teraniura reports that she feels \"ill and pain\" in her body when her r'au does not succeed with the recipient. \"I wait and try to figure out what this pain is, and after some days, you will know that it does not come from you, it's the r'au, and it's the behaviour of the person who you gave the r'au to.\" 52For the mana (supernatural power) that the r'au should possess, the failure of r'au means that the illness backtracks to the creator of the r'au through the r'au itself: \"If someone gives r'au to you, you have to follow the instructions to protect both yourself and the healer. You think they won't know what you do, but they do. They know that you did not respect r'au. You need to have patience (fa'aoro mai) for your recovery. Usually, r'au is taken for three days and you are not meant to take m'a 'pani for one week.\" 53Coco, another reputedly skilled healer of the community, also states that she would know if the receiver of her r'au does not respect the protocols: \"I would know when r'au fails. Because the next time I make r'au for that person, the r'au turns into a dark colour. Even before they come to me asking for that r'au again, this is how I know easily that the patient did not follow the protocols. You need to respect them for at least a month. If you would like to push yourself harder, you can extend it to two or three months to guarantee the success of r'au. You could even continue on the restricted diet forever if you could. The most common mistake people make is that they cannot resist drinking alcohol.\" 54Some r'au recipes are considered as family property. As Lemaitre (1985) distinguishes between pouvoir and savoir, knowing the preparation methods does not necessarily provide one with authorisation or power to heal until one is 'given' (hro'ahia) the permission to make the r'au. Specialists who create r'au for severe illness such as cancer are especially reluctant to share the recipes for those r'au. In such cases where recipes are kept discrete, the 'secrecy' itself plays part of efficacy which poses a hurdle to public distribution of knowledge (see Leca, 2020). Failure in correctly dosing the ingredients does not only make the r'au \"fail\" to cure illness, but also causes severe side effects and/or brings the illness to the creator of r'au. In order to minimise the risk of failure, r'au practitioners prefer to privately compound the r'au that involves a complicated preparation method before handing it over to the recipient. 55One specialist stated that if one makes a mistake in dosing a strong r'au, it can put the recipient in a coma for a week or they would need to seek biomedical attention. For instance, metuapua'a (microsorum grossum) used to be (and still is in the less urbanised islands) one of the most common ingredients for r'au m'ohi (Girardi et al., 2015; P\u00e9tard and Florence, 1986). However, it is used much less frequently in Moorea as it can be toxic if dosed excessively. Teraniura said that she would never give away instructions for r'au that involves metuapua'a to protect the patient and herself. 56The kinds of r'au distributed to the public tend to be \"preventative\" and do not involve expectations regarding the healing of a specific illness, nor complex preparation methods. For instance, r'au puaroto is a common medicine that is known to be multifunctional. R'au he'a is often taken by women for menstrual health. Both are relatively \"light\" in terms of their usage, protocols, and the degree of difficulty regarding their preparation. Nevertheless, some healers find it problematic for this practice to involve no spiritual tie between the healer and the recipient, with the r'au usually acting as the mediator. The healers' spiritual concentration on specific patients and their illness is absent in the process of r'au making. If the r'au is not aimed at healing a specific medical condition, it is also logically impossible for it to \"succeed\" or \"fail\" in curing the illness. Coco made a similar remark on the absence of social relations that r'au would intermediate between the healer and the receiver: \"Praying is very important when making r'au. I seldom go to the church on Sundays but that doesn't mean that I am not religious. I pray for God and also for the person that I make r'au for. But what I don't agree with is that you don't know what r'au you are taking when handed out like that in public. Who made the r'au and for whom? R'au does not succeed without a purpose and will. In fact, one of our children got ill once after taking one of those kind [the distributed r'au]. It's no good.\" 57Being produced by a healer and physically incorporated into the patient's body, the r'au functions as an invisible mediator, or a thread on which an illness oscillates between the two entities. The healing system of r'au m'ohi is thus essentially corporative, being founded on the social trust of the two agents in following the same protocols. In a mass distribution of r'au, there is no will, belief and agreement of all agents involved towards a pragmatic efficacy\u2014the healing of an illness. The healer and the receiver no longer communicate through the r'au and its associated protocols, and the boundary among different social agents is blurred. The resurgence of r'au m'ohi in the religious scene and its claimed \"failure\" illuminated the role of culturally specific meanings in the healing process, also called \"the effectiveness of symbols\" (L\u00e9vi-Strauss, 1977) and \"symbolic efficacy\" (Young, 1978). 58On the one hand, some consider that the primary goal of the distribution of r'au m'ohi is to establish a spiritual channel between its receivers and God. They focus on its \"theological efficacy\", which corresponds to its capacity to fuel the spiritual energy into the body. On the other hand, however, the epm's tendency to neglect some of the healing practice's traditional protocols has caused negative reactions among others who consider that r'au m'ohi should achieve a \"pragmatic efficacy\" and actually cure an illness. Whether it is for \"pragmatic\" or \"theological\" efficacy, or aimed for an individual or a crowd, the same substance used for r'au m'ohi can change its ontological nature depending on the contexts and actions of the human agents (see Coupaye, 2018). R'au he'a with the same ingredients can cure menstrual cramps through the godly power channelled by the healer, or collectively taken, it can establish the spiritual connection between God and M'ohi by its very fusion into the body. 59Not only the substance, but also the body of the receivers changes its nature in the two contexts. In the private sphere, some r'au are personalised and their efficacy results from the appropriate relational model between specific agents, such as the healer, the recipient and the r'au itself. In contrast, public distribution of r'au homogenises the attendants by the absence of individually tailored relationships. This generalises human bodies with a certain yet ambiguous ethnic constraint; while r'au should be a universally valid medical practice, its theological efficacy is to be established for M'ohi who righteously cherishes God and their mother fenua. It is especially made for M'ohi, in their ancestral knowledge and relationship with God, as a channel to strengthen this ethnically specific relationship with the Divine. In this regard, the distribution ritual solidifies M'ohi as an ethnic group rather than differentiating individual bodies and their illnesses. 60From a private home to a public church building, from personal relations to public distribution and performance, and from pragmatic solutions to the ethnic manifestation, the kinds of shift that accompanied the novel practice of r'au m'ohi is not unique to this particular medical practice, yet also seen in other indigenous traditions involving human bodies. As the tattooing practice in Samoa increasingly gains global recognition, its efficacy has been progressively shifting to focus on the image over the encoded readability of designs, or the visual representation over the relations between different agents involved in the tattooing process (Galliot, 2017). In French Polynesia, tattooing has acquired a new meaning as an ethnic identity marker in the cultural renaissance after it had been condemned and banned by their colonial governments (Kuwahara, 2005). Having gone through severe colonial oppression and appropriation, Hawaiian hula is now both spiritual practice transmitted privately and public performance of the indigenous pride (Rowe, 2008; Goodyear-Ka'opua, Hussey, and Wright, 2014). Similarly, Maori people's haka is now beyond a ceremonial dance and performed as an embodiment of their indigeneity (Smith, 2017; Cl\u00e9ment, 2017). Such changes of indigenous traditions raise questions about cultural authenticity, transmission and change, likely due to the colonial romanticisation of indigenous cultures being static and unchanging. While also being an intangible heritage, \"efficacy\" in traditional medicine can highlight both its cultural legitimacy and malleability in its development. 61Traditional medicine as resistance to colonial deprivation and cultural change creates a field of controversy within the indigenous community, building up to the contemporary reconstruction of the practice. The contemporary scene of r'au m'ohi does not only involve diverse forms of practice, but also multiple definitions of its \"efficacy\". When some r'au practitioners say \"they [epm] are only pretending\" (fa'ahua) about the new practice, what they really do is to re-define the indigenous knowledge and practice. The resurgence of r'au m'ohi is one of many manifestations of the anti-colonial sentiment, nostalgia, and the threat of losing M'ohi people's cultural identity. It did not simply result in a restoration of the practice, but rather contributed to the reconstruction and re-definition of r'au m'ohi. 62In the rapidly changing environment that indigenous peoples face in their everyday life, their traditional medical practice is also subject to change and reconstruction. In the urban settings of French Polynesia, the ideological re-evaluation of r'au m'ohi created the novel practice of public distribution in their religious services. While this practice itself is motivated by resistance to the colonial oppression of indigenous identity and practices, it simultaneously provoked internal resistance within the indigenous community. The claim for the new practice's \"failure\" highlights the unique nature of r'au m'ohi as a healing system, as well as the plurality of \"efficacy\" in its contemporary scene. While the conventional practice of r'au m'ohi aims for a \"pragmatic efficacy\", directed towards the healing of an illness, the novel practice performed by the epm encompasses a \"theological efficacy\", embodying the spiritual connection with God. 63The traditional practice of r'au m'ohi is often an individually tailored healing aiming for a specific result, namely, curing an existing illness. There are dietary requirements to be followed, and the desired outcome is shared and visualised by all participants. As its interchangeability with biomedicine suggests, it is the M'ohi art of approaching an illness based on practical rather than on theoretical considerations. On the other hand, the novel practice performed by the epm does not have a specific, practical goal. They do generally encourage application of r'au m'ohi in order to cure an illness, yet their foremost purpose for utilisation of r'au m'ohi is rather ideological than pragmatic. The intake of r'au establishes a channel between the Divinity and an individual through fenua, which itself is the meaningful goal of the practice. Efficacy, therefore, is already achieved at the point of r'au intake, not by its consequences. This view of efficacy also conceptually homogenises a variety of r'au m'ohi as well as the bodies of its receivers, in contrast to the traditional view in which efficacy is achieved on the harmony of the individual agents involved. This suggests the possibility for further research examining the ontological nature and its shift of r'au materials and of the receiver's bodies, particularly in relation with the ethnic particularity of \"theological efficacy\". 64This paper disentangles the contesting nature and process of cultural change and reconstruction in traditional medicine in colonial contexts. The criticism of the novel practice performed by the epm poses a question as to what makes r'au m'ohi an \"effective\" treatment. Examining people's narratives about \"success\" and \"failure\" illuminates what \"efficacy\" really means in the context of traditional Polynesian medicine depending on the way it is performed today. Recognising the local polysemy of \"efficacy\", instead of assigning the same definition of the notion to different practices, allows for a better understanding of the reappropriation and reconstruction process of r'au m'ohi in French Polynesia today. Different definitions of what it means to be effective might result in both harmony and conflict, which ultimately forms the holistic scene of traditional practice in the present. "}
