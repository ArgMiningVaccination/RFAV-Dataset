It can be difficult to focus on our responsibilities, families, or the things we enjoy when our mind is constantly pulled elsewhere by distracting thoughts. Taking time each day to sit peacefully and clear our minds can help our bodies and spirits reset and give us a renewed sense of physical and mental energy. The practice of meditation promotes mental clarity, mindfulness in our daily lives, and can replace that feeling of divided attention with a feeling of spiritual awakening. Spending even just a few moments everyday in quiet contemplation can be a great self care ritual that is both effective in manys ways and easy to incorporate into our routines. While there are no special tools required in order to practice meditation, many may find that aromatherapy helps to enhance the meditation experience. Essential oils are widely known to have powerful effects on both the body and mind, making them the perfect companion to the practice of meditation. Depending on the intentions we have for mediation, there are different essential oils that can help to complement and enhance the experience.
