What Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4 -5 is and what it is used for Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 is a vaccine used for preventing COVID-19 caused by SARS -CoV -2. It is given to adults and adolescents from 12 years of age and older. The vaccine causes the immune system (the body's natural defences) to produce antibodies and blood cells that work against the virus, so giving protection against COVID -19. As Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4 -5 does not contain the virus to produce immunity, it cannot give you COVID-19. The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations. 2. What you need to know before you receive Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5 should not be given if you are allergic to the active substance or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6) Warnings and precautions Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given the vaccine if: you have ever had a severe allergic reaction or breathing problems after any other vaccine injection or after you were given this vaccine in the past. you are feeling nervous about the vaccination process or have ever fainted following any needle injection. you have a severe illness or infection with high fever. However, you can have your vaccination if you have a mild fever or upper airway infection like a cold. 2 2023 -0086009, 2023- 0086179 you have a bleeding problem, you bruise easily or you use a medicine to prevent blood- clots. you have a weakened immune system, because of a disease such as HIV infection or a medicine such as corticosteroid that affects your immune system. There is an increased risk of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart) after vaccination with Comirnaty (see section 4). These conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccina tion and have primarily occurred within 14 days. They have been observed more often after the second vaccination, and more often in younger males. The risk of myocarditis and pericarditis seems lower in children ages 5 to 11 years compared with ages 12 to 17 years. Most cases of myocarditis and pericarditis recover. Some cases required intensive care support and fatal cases have been seen. Following vaccination, you should be alert to signs of myocarditis and pericarditis, such as breathlessness, palpitations and chest pain, and seek immediate medical attention should these occur. As with any vaccine, Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5 may not fully protect all those who receive it and it is not known how long you will be protected. The efficacy of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5 may be lower in people who are immunocompromised. If y ou are immunocompromised, you may receive additional dose s of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5. In these cases, you should continue to maintain physical precautions to help prevent COVID -19. In addition, your close contacts should be vaccinated as appropriate. Discuss appropriate individual recommendations with your doctor. Children Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5 (15/15 micrograms )/dose dispersion for injection is not recommended for children aged under 12 years.
