Here, we practice the 5000-year-old ancient Indian philosophy and holistic approach to cultivating health and wellness. Throughout your stay, you will have the opportunity to learn about and practice Ayurveda through treatments, cuisine, physical exercise, and meditation. Ayurveda Treatments Revive the body, calm the mind, and bring balance to your being. We offer an extensive selection of Ayurvedic treatments using carefully-chosen warm oils and techniques developed and perfected over thousands of years. Using a combination of herbal oils, this four-handed treatment provides a smooth and rhythmic massage to leave you feeling mentally calm and physically restored. The experience of two pairs of hands working the massage is extraordinary. This massage technique depends on the health problem being treated. Ayurvedic Back Massage helps to alleviate pain, soften the muscle, boost the nervous system, and relax tension. It also exerts pressure on specific points along the spine to improve breathing function. This very traditional massage technique uses a warm muslin bag containing organic herbs. There are three to choose from\u2014Rejuvenation, Detoxification, and Panacea (for pain). This treatment can be performed by a single practitioner or two in synchronisation. A powerful oil-based massage, Chavutti is principally applied with the barefoot, although hands are used for the finishing touches. Our highly-skilled practitioners use intricate sweeping footwork to knead and cause friction of the skin and connective tissue that supports the muscles, organs, and energy pathways (meridians). A most relaxing experience at BodyHoliday, the Indian Head Massage is designed to relieve tension and stress in the head, face, neck, and shoulders. Originating from a martial art technique, this deep tissue massage engages 108 points in the body (what your practitioner will refer to as \"Marma\") to invigorate from head to toe. This effective combination treatment begins with a massage on crucial body pressure points to drain mucus, followed by steam inhalation using herbs and oils. An antidote for anxiety, exhaustion, and fatigue, Shirodhara is an extraordinary experience in which specifically chosen oil continuously flows onto the forehead or \"third eye,\" bringing tranquillity and clarity. This powerful detoxifying technique uses organic herbs and combines massage, exfoliation, and a full body wrap. Udwarthan will leave you feeling nourished and cleansed. This treatment can be performed by a single practitioner or two in synchronisation. This technique is often chosen for those suffering from spinal conditions such as degeneration and inflammation. Your practitioner will make a circular bund on the affected area filled with hot medicated oil to relieve aches and pain. Your treatment begins with a massage of the back focusing on meridians running along the spine. Then pitta oil is used to relieve pain and decreases the level of lactic acid in the muscles. This is followed by a massage of the entire back using warm bundles of herbs with a focus on the affected area. An effective detox treatment, Nabhi Abhyanga stimulates and regulates your inner digestive fire, toning the abdominal muscles. This massage helps with constipation, gas, and bloating and reduces fat in the stomach. Ayurveda Cuisine Ayurveda, an ancient Indian philosophy of living wisely and a sister science to yoga, teaches that food is essential to physical health and well-being. At the BodyHoliday, Ayurvedic cuisine is served as part of our menu of possibilities. The Ayurvedic approach to cooking is based on a range of healing principles, including the three Doshas (the energies in the body), the five elements, and the six tastes. The practice also includes eating at the optimal time and focuses on the needs of each individual to improve health and digestion and bring harmony to the body, mind, and spirit. You can learn more about our [Eat Well Programme](https://www.thebodyholiday.com/food-philosophy/) at BodyHoliday, including Ayurveda Cuisine and other custom diets and weight loss plans. Ayurveda Body Yoga Yoga is a spiritual sister to Ayurveda, and many practices of physical exercise and meditation are linked between the two. Discipline, patience, focus, and concentration increase through Yoga training. At BodyHoliday, we use Ayurvedic body yoga to strengthen both body and mind. Look beyond the material world, experience self, and feel more at one with nature.
