Methods: Adult patients with COVID-19 who received TCM treatment were divided into a non-serious group (mild and moderate types) and a serious group (severe and critical types) according to their admission conditions. The medical records and prescriptions of these patients were investigated to determine their TCM utilization patterns. Results: In all, 3,872 COVID-19 patients were included. Oral Chinese traditional patent medicine (CPM) was the most commonly used type of TCM (83.2%), followed by decoction (64.4%). As for med ication pattern, the proportion of multi-drug combinations was higher than single drug use (55.0% vs.45.0%). Decoction combined with oral CPM was the most common combination (39.1%, 1,514/3,872). Orally administered, injected, and externally applied CPM were signi cantly more common in the serious group than in the non-serious, while decoction and non-drug TCM treatments were more common in the non-serious than in the serious group. Multi-drug combinations were used for the majority of patients in bo th groups, mainly in the form of decoction combined with oral CPM. Serious patients were analysed by three groups of different prognoses and outcomes, including discharged after improvement,discharged after relapse and improvement, died nally. The two most common medication patterns were decoction combined with oral CPM and oral CPM alone in the two nally discharged groups. Oral CPM alone or used in combination with injected CPM were seen most commonly in the death group. Signi cant differences were established in medication patterns among patients in these three groups. Conclusions: Oral CPM was the mainly used TCM for COVID-19 patients, followed by decoction. More common medication pattern was multi-drug combination, especially decoction combined with oral CPM. The treatment measures and medicationpatterns of TCM commonly used in COVID-19 patients with the range of conditions found in this study should be further explored in the future to provide a more complete reference for COVID-19 treatment. Keywords: COVID-19, Descriptive analysis, Drug utilization, Medication pattern, Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) Introduction Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel acute respiratory infectious disease caused by the novelcoronavirus (2019-nCoV or SARS-CoV-2). Clinically, COVID-19 is classi ed into four types: mild, moderate, severe, and critically ill[1]. The World Health Organiza- tion (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak a \"pandemic \"on March 11, 2020[2]. By mid-November 2021, there had been more than 253 million con rmed cases and more than 5 million deaths reported to WHO[3]. The pandemic is still underway as of this writing. Several variants of the virus such as the delta variant have emerged, and pose important challenges to diseasetreatment, prevention, and control. In November 2021, Merck and P zer announced that they had developed the new oral antiviral drugs Molnupiravir and Paxlovid,respectively, which have been proven to have speci c effects on COVID-19 [4-5]. There was no speci c treat- ment for COVID-19 patients before this. The guidelinesof the United States and WHO recommended general treatment, antiviral treatment, immunotherapy, gluco- corticoid therapy, and respiratory support as the mainmeasures to save patients 'lives [6-7]. The use of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is recommended in China 's COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment guidelines[1].The Diagnosis and treatment plan for COVID-19 (trial version3 )rstly de nes TCM treatment protocol. Subsequent versions of the diagnosis and treatment plans adjusted the details of this approachand recommended new TCM treatments[8-9].

Acupuncture and Herbal Medicine (2022) 2:2 Received 08 December 2021 / Accepted 19 April 2022http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/HM9.0000000000000030Original ArticleAcupuncture and Herbal Medicine OPEN 91prescribe various TCM treatment measures based on the disease stage and symptom differentiation. A white paperon China 's actions to combat COVID-19 published by the State Council of China noted that the utilization rate of TCM and the total effective rate of con rmed cases in Hubei Province exceeded 90%[10]. Several large-scale studies in China have shown that Chinese traditional patent medicine (CPM) such as Lianhua Qingwen capsule, Xuebijing injection, and prescription decoction such as Qingfei Paidu decoction, are effective in alleviating clinical symptoms, improving the prognosesof severe patients and reducing the mortality rate[11-13]. Studies have also preliminarily explored the potential effect of TCM on the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant[14]. However, studies of TCM treatment for COVID-19 have mainly focused on the effect of single CPM use or prescription decoction alone. There has been no large sample size report on TCM utilization or medicationpatterns in the clinical practice of treating COVID-19 patients by CPM, prescription decoction, or non-drug TCM treatment measures as recommended in thenational guidelines. This study therefore conducted a descriptive analysis of the use of TCM during hospitali- zation of COVID-19 patients to clarify the utilization andmedication patterns of TCM in COVID-19 patients,provide a scienti c basis for the application of TCM in the treatment of COVID-19, and provide other countries with a reference for this information. Methods Participants The participants were patients over 18years of age diagnosed based on The Diagnosis and treatment plan for COVID-19 who received TCM treatment in two hospitals in Wuhan from January 18, 2020 to April 26, 2020. They were divided into a non-serious (including mildand moderate cases categorized based on the diagnosis and treatment plan for COVID-19 ) and a serious (including severe and critically ill categorized based on the samecriteria) group according to their admission conditions atadmission. Age, gender, comorbidities, symptoms and signsatadmission,clinicaloutcome,anddrugprescriptions were all extracted from electronic medical records. Inclusion criteria The inclusion criteria were the following: (1) Con rmed cases diagnosed based on the Diagnosis and treatment plan for COVID-19 (trial version7 ) published by the National Health Commission and State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicineof China [15]. The clinical classi cations include mild, moderate, severe, and critically ill types. (2) Treated with TCM during hospitalization.(3) Patients aged over 18years. Exclusion criteria Patients whose medical records and prescriptions were unavailable or incomplete are excluded. Denition of TCM treatment measures TCM in this study included orally tered CPM, injected CPM, externally administered TCM treatment such as acupuncture and moxibustion. TCM utilization was de ned as the use of at least one of the aforementioned TCM treatment measures at some point during the course of the disease. Medication patterns included single drug use and multi-drug combi-nations.Singledrugusewasde nedastheuseofonekindof the various mentioned TCM treatment measures (the utilization of Western medicines was not observed in thisstudy, so the use of a TCM alone would also include the use of various drugsin a single category or the combination of a TCM with other Western medication). The use of multi-drug combinations are de ned as the combined use of two or more categories of TCM listed above. Statistical analyses R 4.0.2 software was used for statistical analyses. The measurement data are expressed as means \u00b1standard deviations, and count data are expressed as numerals (percentages). Independent-sample t-tests and chi-square testswereperformedonthemeasurementandcountdataof different groups. P<0.05 was considered statistically signicant. Results Clinical features of enrolled patients As shown in Table 1, a total of 3,872 COVID-19 patients were included, 1,571 in the non-serious group and 2,301 in the serious group. People over 60years old accountedfor the majority of the patients and were more likely to be in the serious group. Patients with comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, cerebrovascular disease, lowerrespiratory disease, and chronic liver disease had a signicantly increased probability to be in serious conditions ( P<0.05). Serious patients were more likely to have the symptoms of dyspnea and abnormal lung CT results than fever and cough ( P<0.05). Most patients in both groups were eventually cured and discharged, butthe death rate and length of hospital stay in the seriousgroup were signi cantly higher and longer ( P<0.05). TCM utilization and medication patterns of all patients together and by group All patients Oral CPM accounted for the highest proportion of instances of TCM utilization (3,220, and non-drug TCM treatment (182, 4.7%). Single drugs were used for 1,742 patients (45.0%), including a single use of decoction and four kinds of CPM. The use of oral CPMalone accounted for the highest proportion of single CPMuse (1,225, 31.6%). A total of 2,130 patients (55.0%) used multi-drug combinations, of which decoction combined with oral CPM was the most common(1,514, 39.1%), followed by a combination of decoction, oral CPM, and injected CPM (187, 4.8%). All other drug combinations were used in less than 4% of participants.Details are available in Table 2. Patients with different admission conditions First, the utilization of TCM and the proportions of oral CPM (86.7%), injected CPM (12.0%), and www.ahmedjournal.com 92(4.4%) were signi cantly higher in serious in the non-serious group (78.0%, 6.2%, and 2.4%,respectively). Decoction and non-drug TCM treatments were more commonly used in the non-serious group (non- serious group: 70.0%, 9.4% vs. serious group: 60.5%,1.5%). All of these differences between the two groups were statistically signi cant ( P<0.05). In the medication patterns, the proportions of single drug use were 44.0%(691/1,571) and 45.7% (1,051/2,301) in the non-serious and serious groups respectively; the proportions of the use of multi-drug combinations were 56.0% (880/1,571) and54.3% (1,250/2,301). The oral CPM (39.7% in the non- serious group vs.38.7% in the serious group). Commonly used combinations in the non-serious group included thefollowing: decoction combined with non-drug TCM treatment; a combination of decoction, oral CPM, and injected CPM; and a combination of decoction, oralCPM, and non-drug TCM treatment. Commonly used combinations in the serious group included (1) a combination of decoction, oral CPM, and injectedCPM and (2) oral CPM combined with injected CPM. The proportions of other combinations were all less than 3% in both groups. The details are available in Table 2. Patients in the serious group with different prognoses and outcomes Of the 2,301 patients in the serious group, 2,028 were discharged after improvement, 170 were discharged after relapse and improvement, and 103 died nally after continuous progression. The use of decoction, oral CPM, and non-drug TCM treatments all appeared more often inthe relapse group (68.8%, 4.1%) than theprogression to death group (18.4%, 80.6%, 1.0%). Injected CPM appeared more often in the progression to death group (35.0%) than in the relapse group (16.5%)or the improvement group (10.4%). There were signi - cant differences among the three groups in the proportion of the use of all types of TCM except externally appliedCPM. In the TCM medication pattern, the two medica- tion patterns that appeared most often in the two discharged groups were decoction combined with oralCPM and single oral CPM use, while in the progression to death group, the use of oral CPM and combination of oral CPM and injected CPM were most common. There weresignicant differences in the patterns of medication used among the three groups ( P<0.05). See Table 3 for details. The changing trend in weekly medication patterns in serious patients is shown in Figure 1. Discussion Evidence regarding the use of TCM application for COVID-19 treatment Theoretical basis of TCM COVID-19 is considered a yicondition in TCM. In the Ming dynasty, Wu Youke, a Chinese medical scientist, described the etiology of yidiseases as yi qi in his work Treatise on Warm-Heat Pestilence (Wen Y\u00ec L\u00f9n) . The recommended treatment is to eliminate yi qi as a rst priority and to strengthen Vital qi to eliminate the pathogenic factor [16]. TCM has established a complete theory to regard yias a disease, and this theory hasTable 1 Clinical characteristics of all patients and patient groups according to admission condition.

After TCM treatment measure have been adopted in the Diagnosis and treatment plan for COVID-19 , TCM diagnoses and recommendations for treatments have been updated and expanded based onmore clinical experience to identify the right direction for the TCM treatment of COVID-19. Evidence of modern basic medical science and pharmacology Modern basic medical science and pharmacology studies have provided evidence regarding the application of TCMin the treatment of COVID-19. Many Chinese herbs, such as scutellaria, radix isatidis, Paidu decoction, have de nite antiviral effects, which can inhibit the replication of different viruses including in fluenza virus and coronavi- rus [18-19]. Oral CPM Lianhua Qingwen capsules have been found to signi cantly inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro[20]. At the same time, TCM has positive effects on immunomodulation by restraining excessive immune activation and the cytokine stormcaused by COVID-19 and resisting acute lung injury[21]. Moreover, the study of network pharmacology has identi ed integrative network mechanisms of TCM in COVID-19 treatment, which regulates the organism integrally and works against COVID-19 through multiple ingredients, targets, and means[22-23].Clinical practice of TCM application in the treatment of COVID-19 Clinical characteristics of patients COVID-19 patients in this study who were older (over 60years old) and had other underlying diseases (such as hypertension, diabetes, cerebrovascular diseases, lowerrespiratory tract diseases, or chronic liver diseases) were more likely to be serious cases upon admission to the hospital. The death rate of serious patients was higher,and the length of hospital stay was longer. These observations are consistent with the results of previous research [24]. Discussion of results for all patients and patients with different admission conditions Oral CPM was administered on a large-scale during the treatment of all patients, including in both the non-serious and serious groups. In all, non-serious and serious patients, the proportion of oral CPM utilization wasthe highest (83.2%, 3,220/3,872; 78.0%, 1,226/1,571;86.7%, 1,994/2,301). The two medication patterns that were most commonly used were decoction combined with oral CPM (39.1%, 1,514/3,872;39.7%, 623/1,571;38.7%, may berelated to easy preservation. It is most convenient to use in Figure 1. Trends in weekly medication patterns in serious patients. injected CPM; oral and injected of no: did not use TCM. The number marked on the bar is the number of people using the given medication pattern. The gray line shows thetrends in medication administration.Tan et al. /C15Volume 2 /C15Number 2 /C152022 www.ahmedjournal.com 95an oral form. Injection CPM is only recommended for serious patients (severe and critically ill patients), forwhom the use of oral medicine may be limited because of their worsening condition and dif culty in swallowing on their own. CPM is recommended in multiple national andlocal diagnosis and treatment plans for COVID-19 [25].I n all, 14 types of CPM are recommended in the most recent diagnosis and treatment plan for COVID-19 released bythe National Health Commission and the Administration of traditional Chinese medicine[1]. Six kinds of orally administered CPM, excluding Suhexiang and Angong Niuhuang pills, are recommended for non-serious patients, and eight kinds of injected CPM are used only for serious patients (severe and critically ill patients). The effectiveness of CPM against COVID-19 is an importantbasis for large-scale clinical application. Clinical studies have shown that a range of CPM has good effect in patients with different clinical types of COVID-19.Many drugs have been studied and shown to be effective, such as Jinhua Qinggan granules [26],Lianhua Qingwen capsules or granules[27],Xuebijing injections[12,28 -29], and so forth. Further high-quality prospective studies should be carried out to verify the exact effectiveness of these drugs. Decoction is also widely used in COVID-19 patients. The overall utilization proportion reached 64.4% (2,493/ 3,872), and the combination with oral CPM constituted the most common medication pattern. Decoction is alsorecommended by the guidelines and is commonly used in clinical practice. In TCM, the emphasis falls on applying proper therapeutic measures in accordance with seasonalconditions, local conditions, and patients 'characteristics. In COVID-19, this principle was applied by sorting patients into different syndrome types of TCM anddrawing up different prescriptions. The latest diagnosisand treatment plan released by the National Health Commission includes 10 types of syndrome according to TCM and recommended corresponding decoction [1]. Hospitals and TCM experts nationwide apply these principles and adjust them flexibly on this basis[30]. The effectiveness of decoction used in clinical practice isanother basis for its promotion. Qingfei Paidu decoction, for instance, has been proven to be effective against COVID-19 in a retrospective analysis with a large samplesize [13]. In the press conference held by the State Council in March 2020, based on substantial clinical evidence, the experts recommended \"three medicines and three TCM prescriptions \"including decoction, which had been proven to have obviouseffectiveness against COVID-19. These important results determined in clinical practice have been presented inter- nationally to aid other countries 'treatment regimes[31-32]. Finally, multi-drug combinations were commonly presented during the treatment of COVID-19 patients. A total of 2,130 patients (55.0%) were treated with multi-drug combinations, including 56.0% (880/1,571) non- serious patients and 54.3% (1,250/2,301) serious patients. The diagnosis and treatment plan recommendsthat severe and critically ill patients are given onetreatment or a combination of two treatments of CPM according to the individual condition. Injected CPM combined with decoction was also recommended [1]. Mild and moderate patients also received multi-drug combi- nations on a large scale, which may be due to theincomplete guidelines and the need for the rapid alleviation of symptoms in earlier clinical practice.Combinations of multiple CPM and decoction may increase drug-induced risks due to the overuse of congeneric drugs or drugs with the same effects[33].I n future clinical applications, additional attention should be paid to balancing the bene ts and risks of drug utilization, strengthening pharmaceutical care, andavoiding unreasonable drug combinations. Discussion of the results of patients in the serious group with different prognoses and outcomes Patients in the serious group with good prognoses who were ultimately discharged had a high proportion of TCM use. Among the patients in the serious group, theproportion of discharge was much higher than that of death. The utilization proportions of decoction, oral CPM, and non-drug TCM treatment in patients in the twogroups that were ultimately discharged were signi cantly higher than those in the group of patients who died nally. In terms of medication patterns, the two most common medication patterns in the two groups nally discharged were decoction combined with oral CPM and single oral CPM and the proportions of these were much higher than in the group that died, while in the deathgroup were single oral CPM and combined with injection CPM. This is consistent with previous research results, in which severe and critically ill patients who received TCMtreatment had a signi cant reduction in mortality rate, and both decoction and CPM are widely used in clinical practice [34-35]. This study found that the categories of TCM use were different in the three groups of serious patients. The proportion of utilization of injected CPM in patients who diednally after continuous progression was signi cantly higher than those in the two groups who were ultimately discharged. This result may be due to the continuously worsening condition of patients. They may have devel-oped symptoms of somnolence and convulsion, for instance, or required invasive mechanical ventilation for respiratory support. In such a case, patients cannotswallow autonomously, and the use of decoction and orally administered CPM is limited [1,36]. The latest diagnosis and treatment plan recommends eight kindsof injected CPM for the treatment of severe and criticallyill patients [1], among which, many drugs, Tanreqing injection[39], and Reduning injection[40], have been shown to have good effect in clinical studies. Strengths and limitations This study is the rst one to describe TCM use in clinical practice qualitatively in a large sample size population. The study comprehensively reported the utilization of medication patterns of various TCM in detail, includingcommon combination patterns and monotherapy pat-terns. It provides a reference for clinical medication. However, this study only reports the category of TCM for clarity rather than listing all the names of drugs for thereare too many medicines used in clinical practice to list them all. Besides, when serious patients 'conditions were grouped by the clinical outcome, only in-hospital deathsreported by medical records were recorded. Deaths after hospital discharge were not included. Additionally,Tan et al. /C15Volume 2 /C15Number 2 /C152022 www.ahmedjournal.com 96further research is needed to explore the in fluencing factors of the differences in the utilization proportion andpatterns of TCM and their impact on the progression and outcome of the disease. Prospects of TCM treatment of COVID-19 During the COVID-19 outbreak, TCM, as a treatment unique to China, has been proven to be effective in many respects. It plays an important role in China 'sght against the virus, and may also be valuable for other countries intheir response to the pandemic. It has been used in SouthKorea, Italy, and Hungary [32,41]. Treatment of coronavi- rus diseases with TCM did not start with COVID-19 but with SARS in 2003. A meta-analysis showed that TCMcan reduce the mortality of SARS patients, shorten the time of fever reduction, and shorten the length of hospital stay[42]. In addition, TCM is effective in the prevention of SARS[43]. The philosophy of TCM includes to cure a disease before its onset, and it stresses that prevention isthe best treatment. Due to the continued emergence of COVID-19 at present, using TCM to prevent will be of great value for epidemic prevention and control. Theprevious use of TCM to prevent SARS and the H1N1 flu provides experience and evidence that can be used in the present case [44]. There have also been theoretical discussions on preventing disease with TCM for high-risk populations such as children and the elderly[45]. Summaries of speci c preventive drugs in different regions have also appeared[46]. However, systematic real-world studies to con rm the preventive effects of TCM are still lacking. More studies in large samples are needed to identify effective prescriptions for prevention. Finally, TCM shows unique effect for severe and critically ill patients in the ght against COVID-19, and the application of TCM in emergency and critical care medicine is an important direction that deserves furtherstudy[47]. The important role of TCM in China during the treatment of COVID-19 can also inspire the application of traditional and natural medicine in other countries andpromote more research into ethnic medicine[48]. Conclusion This study described the drug utilization and medication patterns of TCM in 3,872 COVID-19 patients. In all, oralCPM was the most common used for COVID-19 patients,followed by decoction. Multi-drug combination was more common, especially decoction combined with oral CPM. Drug utilization and mainly used medicationpatterns were different in patients with different con- ditions and outcomes. The treatment measures and medication patterns found in this study should be furtherexplored in the future, hoping to provide a more complete reference for COVID-19 treatment.
