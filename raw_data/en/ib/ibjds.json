What Is a TIP? Treatment Improvement Protocols (TIPs) are developed by the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT), part of the Substance Abuse andMental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) within the U.S.Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Each TIP involves thedevelopment of topic-specific best-practice guidelines for the preventionand treatment of substance use and mental disorders. TIPs draw on theexperience and knowledge of clinical, research, and administrative expertsof various forms of treatment and prevention. TIPs are distributed tofacilities and individuals across the country. Published TIPs can beaccessed via the Internet at h ttp://store.samhsa.gov. Although each consensus-based TIP strives to include an evidence base forthe practices it recommends, SAMHSA recognizes that behavioral health iscontinually evolving, and research frequently lags behind the innovationspioneered in the field. A major goal of each TIP is to convey \"front-line\" information quickly but responsibly. If research supports a particularapproach, citations are provided. When no citation is provided, the infor-mation is based on the collective clinical knowledge and experience of theconsensus panel. viiixConsensus Panel Chair Norman S.

I ndependent Consultant Baltimore, Maryland Expert Panel xii xiiiForeword The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMH- SA) is the agency within the U.S. Department of Health and HumanServices that leads public health efforts to advance the behavioral healthof the nation. SAMHSA's mission is to reduce the impact of substanceabuse and mental illness on America's communities. The Treatment Improvement Protocol (TIP) series fulfills SAMHSA's mis-sion to reduce the impact of substance abuse and mental illness onAmerica's communities by providing evidence-based and best practiceguidance to clinicians, program administrators, and payers. TIPs are theresult of careful consideration of all relevant clinical and health servicesresearch findings, demonstration experience, and implementation require-ments. A panel of non-Federal clinical researchers, clinicians, programadministrators, and patient advocates debates and discusses their particu-lar area of expertise until they reach a consensus on best practices. Fieldreviewers then review and critique this panel's work. The talent, dedication, and hard work that TIPs panelists and reviewersbring to this highly participatory process have helped bridge the gapbetween the promise of research and the needs of practicing clinicians andadministrators to serve, in the most scientifically sound and effective ways,people in need of behavioral health services. We are grateful to all whohave joined with us to contribute to advances in the behavioral healthfield. Pamela S. Hyde, J.D.AdministratorSubstance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration Daryl W. Kade Acting DirectorCenter for Substance Abuse Treatment Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration Executive Summary This Treatment Improvement Protocol (TIP) is a revision of TIP 19, Detoxification From Alcohol and Other Drugs (Center for Substance Abuse Treatment 1995 d). It provides clinicians with updated informa\u00ad tion and expands on the issues commonly encountered in the delivery of detoxification services. Like its predecessor, this TIP was created by a panel of experts (the consensus panel) with diverse experience in detoxi\u00adfication services\u2014physicians, psychologists, counselors, nurses, and social workers, all with particular expertise to share. This diverse group agreed to the following principles, which served as a basis for the TIP: 1. Detoxification, in and of itself, does not constitute complete sub\u00ad stance abuse treatment. 2. The detoxification process consists of three essential components, which should be available to all people seeking treatment: Evaluation Stabilization Fostering patient readiness for and entry into substance abuse treatment 3. Detoxification can take place in a wide variety of settings and at a num\u00ad ber of levels of intensity within these settings. Placement should be appropriate to the patient's needs. 4. All persons requiring treatment for substance use disorders should receive treatment of the same quality and appropriate thoroughness and should be put into contact with substance abuse treatment providers after detoxification. 5. Ultimately, insurance coverage for the full range of detoxification ser\u00ad vices is cost\u00adeffective. 6. Patients seeking detoxification services have diverse cultural and ethnic backgrounds as well as unique health needs and life situations. Programs offering detoxification should be equipped to tailor treatment to their client populations. 7. A successful detoxification process can be measured, in part, by whether an individual who is substance dependent enters and remains in some form of substance abuse treatment/rehabilitation after detoxification. Among the issues covered in this TIP is the importance of detoxification as one component in the continuum of healthcare services for sub\u00ad stance\u00adrelated disorders. The TIP reinforces the urgent need for non\u00ad xv traditional settings\u2014emergency rooms, medi\u00ad cal and surgical wards in hospitals, acute care clinics, and others\u2014to be prepared to partici\u00adpate in the process of getting the patient who is in need of detoxification services into treat\u00adment as quickly as possible. Furthermore, it promotes the latest strategies for retaining individuals in detoxification while also encouraging the development of the therapeu\u00adtic alliance to promote the patient's entrance into substance abuse treatment. The TIP also includes suggestions on addressing psychoso\u00adcial issues that may impact detoxification treatment, such as providing culturally appropriate services to the patient popula\u00adtion. Matching patients to appropriate care repre\u00adsents a challenge to detoxification programs. Given the wide variety of settings and the unique needs of the individual patient, estab\u00adlishing criteria that take into account all the possible needs of patients receiving detoxifica\u00adtion and treatment services is an extraordi\u00adnarily complex task. Addiction medicine has sought to develop an efficient system of care that matches patients' clinical needs with the appropriate care setting in the least restric\u00adtive and most cost\u00adeffective manner. Patient placement criteria, such as those published by the American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) in the Patient Placement Criteria, Second Edition, Revised , represent an effort to define how care settings may be matched to patient needs and special charac\u00adteristics. These criteria\u2014the five \"Adult Detoxification\" placement levels\u2014define the most broadly accepted standard of care for detoxification services. The five levels of care are 1 . Level I\u00adD: Ambulatory Detoxification Without Extended Onsite Monitoring 2. Level II\u00adD: Ambulatory Detoxification With Extended Onsite Monitoring 3. Level II.2\u00adD: Clinically Managed Residential Detoxification 4. Level III.7\u00adD: Medically Monitored Inpatient Detoxification 5 . L evel IV\u00adD: Medically Managed Intensive Inpatient Detoxification ASAM criteria are being adopted extensively on the basis of their face validity, though their outcome validity has yet to be clinically proven. The ASAM guidelines are to be regarded as a work in progress, as their authors readily admit. They are an important set of guidelines that are of great help to clini\u00adcians. For administrators, the standards pub\u00adlished by such groups as the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations and the Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities pro\u00advide guidance for overall program operations. Placement will depend in part on the sub\u00ad stance of abuse. The consensus panel suggests that for alcohol, sedative\u00adhypnotic, and opi\u00adoid withdrawal syndromes, hospitalization (or some form of 24\u00adhour medical care) is often the preferred setting for detoxification, based on principles of safety and humanitarian con\u00adcerns. When hospitalization cannot be pro\u00advided, then a setting that provides a high level of nursing and medical backup 24 hours a day, 7 days a week is desirable. A further challenge for detoxification pro\u00ad grams is to provide effective linkages to sub\u00adstance abuse treatment services. Patients often leave detoxification without followup to the treatment needed to achieve long\u00adterm abstinence. Each year at least 300,000 patients with substance use disorders or acute intoxication obtain inpatient detoxification in general hospitals, while additional numbers obtain detoxification in other settings. Only 20 percent of people discharged from acute care hospitals receive substance abuse treat\u00adment during that hospitalization. Only 15 percent of people who are admitted to a detoxification program through an emergency room and then discharged go on to receive treatment. The consensus panel recognizes that medical\u00ad ly assisted withdrawal is not always necessary or desirable. A nonmedical approach can be highly cost\u00adeffective and provide inexpensive Executive Summary xvi access to treatment for individuals seeking aid. Young individuals in good health, with no history of previous withdrawal reactions, may be well served by management of withdrawal without medication. However, personnel supervising in this setting should be trained to identify life\u00adthreatening symptoms and solicit help through the emergency medical system as needed. The consensus panel also agreed on several guidelines for nonmedical detoxification pro\u00ad grams. Such programs should follow local gov\u00ad ernmental regulations regarding their licensing and inspection. In addition, it is desirable that all such programs have an alcohol and drug\u00ad free environment as well as personnel who are familiar with the features of substance use withdrawal syndromes, have training in basic life support, and have access to an emergency medical system that can transport patients to emergency departments and other sites for clin\u00ad ical care. A major clinical question for detoxification is the appropriateness of the use of medication in the management of an individual in with\u00addrawal. This can be a difficult matter because protocols have not been firmly established through scientific studies or evidence\u00adbased methods. Furthermore, the course of with\u00addrawal is unpredictable and currently avail\u00adable techniques of screening and assessment do not predict who will experience life\u00adthreat\u00adening complications. Although it is the philosophy of some treat\u00ad ment facilities to discontinue all medications, this course of action is not always in the best interest of the patient. Abrupt cessation of psychotherapeutic medications may cause severe withdrawal symptoms or the re\u00ademer\u00ad gence of a psychiatric disorder. As a general rule, therapeutic doses of medication should be continued through any withdrawal if the patient has been taking the medication as pre\u00adscribed. Decisions about discontinuing the medication should be deferred until after the individual has completed detoxification. If, however, the patient has been abusing the medication or the psychiatric condition was clearly caused by substance use, then the rationale for discontinuing the medication is strengthened. Finally, practitioners should consider withholding medication that lowers the seizure threshold (e.g., bupropion, con\u00adventional antipsychotics) during the acute alcohol withdrawal period or at least pre\u00adscribing a loading dose or scheduled taper of benzodiazepine. Further studies are needed to confirm the clinical experience that psychiatric symptoms (including anxiety, depression, and personali\u00adty disorders) respond to specific treatment of the addiction. For example, cognitive-behav\u00adioral techniques employed in the 12\u00adStep treatment approach have been effective in the management of anxiety and depression associ\u00adated with addiction. Although challenging, treatment of both addiction and co\u00adoccurring psychiatric conditions has proven cost\u00adeffec\u00adtive in some studies. This TIP also provides medical information on detoxification protocols for specific sub\u00adstances as well as considerations for individu\u00adals with co\u00adoccurring medical conditions including mental disorders. While the TIP is not intended to take the place of medical texts, it provides the practitioner with an overview of common medical complications seen in individuals who use substances. Disorders of several systems are discussed in some detail: gastrointestinal (including the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and pancreas), cardiovascular system, hematologic (blood) abnormalities, pulmonary (lung) diseases, dis\u00adeases of the central and peripheral nervous system, infectious diseases, and special mis\u00adcellaneous disorders. The TIP presents a cur\u00adsory overview of special conditions, modifica\u00adtions in protocols, and the use of detoxifica\u00adtion medications in patients with co\u00adoccurring medical conditions or mental disorders. Overall treatment of specific conditions is not addressed unless modification of such treat\u00adment is needed. Executive Summary xvii The setting in which detoxification occurs is also influenced by the existence of co\u00adoccur\u00adring medical disorders. It is highly desirable that individuals undergoing detoxification be assessed by primary care practitioners (i.e., physicians, physician assistants, nurse practi\u00adtioners) with some experience in substance abuse treatment. Such an assessment should determine whether the patient is currently intoxicated and the degree of intoxication; the type and severity of the withdrawal syn\u00addrome; information regarding past with\u00addrawals; and the presence of co\u00adoccurring psychiatric, medical, and surgical conditions that might require specialized care. Particular attention should be paid to those individuals who have undergone multiple withdrawals in the past and for whom each withdrawal appears worse than previous ones. Subjects with a history of severe with\u00addrawals, multiple withdrawals, delirium tremens (a potentially fatal syndrome associ\u00adated with alcohol withdrawal), or seizures are not good candidates for detoxification pro\u00adgrams in nonmedical settings. The setting in which detoxification is carried out should be appropriate for the medical and psychological conditions present and should be adequate to provide the degree of monitoring needed to ensure safety (e.g., oximetry [a measurement of the amount of oxygen present in the blood], greater fre\u00adquency of taking vital signs, etc.). Acute, life\u00adthreatening conditions need to be addressed concurrently with the withdrawal process and intensive care unit monitoring may be indicat\u00ad ed. Detoxification staff providing support should be familiar with the signs and symp\u00adtoms of common co\u00adoccurring medical disor\u00ad ders. Likewise, personnel at medical facilities (e.g., emergency rooms, physicians' offices) should be aware of the signs of withdrawal and how it affects the treatment of the pre\u00adsenting medical conditions. This TIP will also bring clinicians and admin\u00ad istrators up to date on administrative issues related to detoxification, including how the services themselves can be paid for. It is unusual in a clinical treatment improvement protocol to discuss issues related to how clini\u00adcal services are reimbursed. In the field of substance abuse and detoxification services, however, reimbursement issues have become so intertwined with the delivery of services that the consensus panel deemed it necessary to address the conflicts and misunderstand\u00adings that sometimes arise between the care systems and the reimbursement systems. Third\u00adparty payors sometimes prefer to man\u00adage payment for detoxification separately from other phases of substance abuse treat\u00adment, thus treating detoxification as if it occurred in isolation from that treatment. This \"unbundling\" of services can result in the separation of services into scattered seg\u00adments. In other instances, reimbursement and utilization policies dictate that only detoxifi\u00adcation can be authorized. This detoxification often does not cover the nonmedical counsel\u00ading that is an integral part of substance abuse treatment. Finally , identifying and maintaining funding sources is a major issue in detoxification. Substance abuse treatment in the United States is financed through a diverse mix of public and private sources, with substantially more being spent by the public sector. The existence of diverse funding streams in sub\u00adstance abuse treatment funding presents both management challenges and opportunities for program independence and stability. However, a program with only one major funding source is financially and clinically vulnerable to changes in its major source's budget and priorities. This situation should be avoided. The TIP suggests ways to diversi\u00adfy funding sources to create a steady stream of resources that can withstand the loss of one particular funding source. This TIP also makes recommendations for fostering relationships with reimbursement organizations, such as managed care organi\u00adzations (MCOs). These positive working rela\u00adtionships are vital to successfully link the patient to the needed services. For example, Executive Summary xviii the MCO may use a wide variety of specific criteria and protocols to determine whether or not services may be authorized for sub\u00adstance abuse, typically including the ASAM patient placement criteria and other level of care or diagnosis\u00adbased criteria sets. Successfully addressing the needs of the staff at MCOs that are responsible for authorizing the care provided to patients is a critical ele\u00adment in maintaining a relationship with an MCO and the program's clinical and financial viability. To do so, staff should understand what MCO staff do, be well trained in con\u00adducting professional relationships over the telephone, be familiar with the criteria and protocols used by the MCOs with which the program has contracts, and have easy access to the abundance of clinical and service infor\u00admation required by an MCO in order to help them complete a review and authorize ser\u00advices. Maintaining thorough, clear, and accu\u00adrate records is essential to this process. Detoxification staff also should be familiar with each MCO's appeal or exceptions process for those occasions when the outcome of a first\u00adlevel review is unsatisfactory. Regardless of their role in providing detoxifi\u00ad cation services, all personnel should keep in mind that patients undergoing detoxification are in the midst of a personal and medical crisis. For many patients, this crisis repre\u00adsents a window of opportunity to acknowledge their substance abuse problem and become willing to seek treatment. Physicians, nurses, substance abuse counselors, and administra\u00adtors are in a unique position, not only to ensure a safe and humane withdrawal from substances of dependency, but also to foster the path for the patient's entry into substance abuse treatment. This TIP suggests ways for clinicians and programs to prepare the patient for treatment while addressing the complex psychosocial and medical variables involved in detoxification. Executive Summary xix In This Chapter... Purpose of the TIP Audience Scope History of Detoxification Services Definitions Guiding Principles in Detoxification and Substance Abuse Treatment Challenges to Providing Effective Detoxification 1 Overview, Essential Concepts, and Definitions in Detoxification Chapter 1 provides a brief historical overview of changes in the percep\u00ad tions and provision of detoxification services. It also introduces the core concepts of the detoxification field, discusses the primary goals of detoxifi\u00ad cation services, clarifies the distinction between detoxification and treat\u00ad ment, and highlights some of the broader issues involved with providing detoxification within systems of care. Purpose of the TIP This TIP is a revision of TIP 19, Detoxification From Alcohol and Other Drugs (Center for Substance Abuse Treatment [CSAT] 1995 d). Significant changes in the area of detoxification services since the publi\u00ad cation of TIP 19 include Refinement of patient placement procedures Increased knowledge of the physiology of withdrawal Pharmacological advances in the management of withdrawal Changes in the role of detoxification in the continuum of services for patients with substance use disorders, and new issues in the management of detoxification services within comprehensive systems of care Emerging issues regarding specific populations (e.g., women, cultural minorities, adolescents) 1 This TIP provides clinicians with up\u00adto\u00addate information in these areas. It also expands on the administrative, legal, and ethical issues commonly encountered in the delivery of detoxification services and suggests perfor\u00admance measures for detoxification programs. Like its predecessor, this TIP was created by a panel of experts with diverse experience in detoxification services\u2014physicians, psycholo\u00adgists, counselors, nurses, and social workers, all with particular expertise to share. Audience The primary audiences for this TIP include substance abuse treatment counselors; adminis\u00ad trators of detoxification programs; Single State Agency directors; psychiatrists and other physicians working in the field; primary care providers such as physicians, nurse practition\u00ad ers, physician assistants, nurses, psychologists, and other clinical staff members; staff of man\u00ad aged care and insurance carriers; policymak\u00ad ers; and others involved in planning, evaluat\u00ad ing, and delivering services for detoxifying patients from substances of abuse. Secondary audiences include public safety/police and criminal justice personnel, educational institu\u00ad tions, those involved with assisting workers (e.g., Employee Assistance Programs), shel\u00ad ters/feeding programs, and managed care orga\u00ad nizations. The TIP also should prove useful to providers of other services in comprehensive systems of care (vocational counseling, occupa\u00ad tional therapy, and public housing/assisted liv\u00ad ing), administrators, and payors (public, pri\u00ad vate, and managed care). Scope Among other issues covered in this TIP is the importance of detoxification as one compo\u00adnent in the continuum of healthcare services for substance\u00adrelated disorders. The TIP reinforces the urgent need for nontraditional settings\u2014such as emergency rooms, medical and surgical wards in hospitals, acute care clinics, and others that do not traditionally provide detoxification services\u2014to be pre\u00adpared to participate in the process of getting the patient who is in need of detoxification into a program as quickly as possible to potentially avoid the myriad possible negative consequences associated with substance abuse (e.g., physiological and psychological distur\u00adbances/disorders, criminal involvement, unemployment, etc.). Furthermore, it pro\u00admotes the latest strategies for retaining indi\u00adviduals in detoxification while also encourag\u00ading the development of the therapeutic alliance to promote the patient's entrance into substance abuse treatment. This includes sug\u00adgestions on addressing psychosocial issues that may affect detoxification services. This TIP provides medical information on detoxification protocols for specific sub\u00adstances, as well as considerations for individ\u00aduals with co\u00adoccurring medical conditions including mental disorders. While the TIP is not intended to take the place of medical texts, it provides the practitioner with an overview of medical considerations. This TIP will also bring clinicians and adminis\u00ad trators up\u00adto\u00addate on important aspects of detoxification, including how the services are to be paid for. It is unusual in a clinical treatment improvement protocol to discuss issues related to how clinical services are reimbursed. However, in the field of substance abuse and detoxification services, reimbursement issues have become so intertwined with the delivery of services that the consensus panel deemed it necessary to address the conflicts and misun\u00ad derstandings that sometimes arise between the care systems and the reimbursement systems. History of Detoxification Services Prior to the 1970s, public intoxication was treated as a criminal offense. People arrested for it were held in the \"drunk tanks\" of local jails where they underwent withdrawal with little or no medical intervention (Abbott et al. Chapter 1 2 1995; Sadd and Young 1987). Shifts in the medical field, in perceptions of addiction, and in social policy changed the way that people with dependency on drugs, including alcohol, were viewed and treated. Two notable events were particularly instrumental in changing attitudes. In 1958, the American Medical Association (AMA) took the official position that alcoholism is a disease. This declaration suggested that alcoholism was a medical prob\u00adlem requiring medical intervention. In 1971, the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws adopted the Uniform Alcoholism and Intoxication Treatment Act, which recommended that \"alcoholics not be subjected to criminal prosecution because of their consumption of alcoholic beverages but rather should be afforded a continuum of treatment in order that they may lead normal lives as productive members of society\" (Keller and Rosenberg 1973, p. 2). While this recommendation did not carry the weight of law, it made a major change in the legal impli\u00adcations of addiction. With these changes came more humane treatment of people with addic\u00adtions. Several methods of detoxification have evolved that reflect a more humanitarian view of people with substance use disorders. In the \" medical model,\" detoxification is characterized by the use of physician and nursing staff and the administration of medication to assist people through withdrawal safely (Sadd and Young 1987). The \"social model\" rejects the use of medication and the need for routine medical care, relying instead on a supportive nonhospi\u00ad tal environment to ease the passage through withdrawal (Sadd and Young 1987). Today, it is rare to find a \"pure\" detoxification model. For example, some social model programs use medi\u00ad cation to ease withdrawal but generally employ nonmedical staff to monitor withdrawal and conduct triage (i.e., sorting patients according to the severity of their disorders). Likewise, medical programs generally have some compo\u00ad nents to address social/personal aspects of addiction. Just as the treatment and the conceptualiza\u00adtion of addiction have changed, so too have the patterns of substance use and the accom\u00adpanying detoxification needs. The popularity of cocaine, heroin, and other substances has led to the need for different kinds of detoxifi\u00adcation services. At the same time, public health officials have increased invest\u00ad The AMA's position is that sub\u00ad stance dependence is a disease, and it encourages physi\u00ad cians and other clinicians, health organizations, and policymakers to base all their activi\u00ad ties on this premise. ments in detoxifica\u00adtion services and substance abuse treatment, especially after 1985, as a means to inhibit the spread of HIV infec\u00adtion and AIDS among people who inject drugs. More recently, people with substance use disor\u00adders are more likely to abuse more than one drug simultane\u00adously (i.e., polydrug abuse) (Office of Applied Studies 2005). The AMA continues to maintain its posi\u00ad tion that substance dependence is a dis\u00ad ease, and it encour\u00ad ages physicians and other clinicians, health organizations, and policymakers to base all their activities on this premise (AMA 2002). As treatment regimens have become more sophisticated and polydrug abuse more com\u00ad mon, detoxification has evolved into a com\u00ad passionate science. Definitions Few clear definitions of detoxification and related concepts are in general use at this time. Criminal justice, health care, substance abuse, mental health, and many other sys\u00ad Overview, Essential Concepts, and Definitions in Detoxification 3 tems all define detoxification differently. This TIP offers a clear and uniform set of defini\u00adtions for the various components of detoxifi\u00adcation and substance abuse treatment that may prove useful to the field of detoxifica\u00adtion. Detoxification Detoxification is a set of interventions aimed at managing acute intoxication and withdraw\u00adal. It denotes a clearing of toxins from the body of the patient who is acutely intoxicated and/or dependent on substances of abuse. Detoxification seeks to minimize the physical harm caused by the abuse of substances. The acute medical management of life\u00adthreatening intoxication and related medical problems generally is not included within the term detoxification and is not covered in detail in this TIP. The Washington Circle Group (WCG), a body of experts organized to improve the quality and effectiveness of substance abuse preven\u00adtion and treatment, defines detoxification as \"a medical intervention that manages an indi\u00ad vidual safely through the process of acute withdrawal\" (McCorry et al. 2000 a, p. 9). The WCG makes an important distinction, however, in noting that \"a detoxification pro\u00ad gram is not designed to resolve the long\u00adstanding psychological, social, and behavioral problems associated with alcohol and drug abuse\" (McCorry et al. 2000 a, p. 9). The con\u00ad sensus panel supports this statement and has taken special care to note that detoxification is not substance abuse treatment and rehabil\u00ad itation. For further explanation, see the text box below. The consensus panel built on existing defini\u00ad tions of detoxification as a broad process with three essential components that may take place concurrently or as a series of steps: Evaluation entails testing for the presence of substances of abuse in the bloodstream, measuring their concentration, and screen\u00ading for co\u00adoccurring mental and physical conditions. Evaluation also includes a com\u00adprehensive assessment of the patient's medi\u00adcal and psychological conditions and social situation to help determine the appropriate level of treatment following detoxification. Essentially, the evaluation serves as the basis for the initial substance abuse treat\u00adment plan once the patient has been with\u00addrawn successfully. Stabilization includes the medical and psy\u00ad chosocial processes of assisting the patient through acute intoxication and withdrawal to the attainment of a medically stable, fully supported, substance\u00adfree state. This often is done with the assistance of medications, though in some approaches to detoxification no medication is used. Stabilization includes familiarizing patients with what to expect in the treatment milieu and their role in treatment and recovery. During this time practitioners also seek the involvement of the patient's family, employers, and Detoxification as Distinct From Substance Abuse Treatment Detoxification is a set of interventions aimed at managing acute intoxication and withdrawal. Supervised detoxification may prevent potentially life\u00adthreatening complications that might appear if the patient were left untreated. At the same time, detoxification is a form of palliative care (reducing the intensity of a disorder) for those who want to become abstinent or who must observe mandatory abstinence as a result of hospitalization or legal involvement. Finally, for some patients it represents a point of first con\u00ad tact with the treatment system and the first step to recovery. Treatment/rehabilitation , on the other hand, involves a constellation of ongoing therapeutic services ultimately intended to promote recovery for substance abuse patients. Chapter 1 4 other significant people when appropriate and with release of confidentiality. Fostering the patient's entry into treatment involves preparing the patient for entry into substance abuse treatment by stressing the importance of following through with the complete substance abuse treatment contin\u00aduum of care. For patients who have demon\u00adstrated a pattern of completing detoxifica\u00adtion services and then failing to engage in substance abuse treatment, a written treat\u00adment contract may encourage entrance into a continuum of substance abuse treatment and care. This contract, which is not legally binding, is voluntarily signed by patients when they are stable enough to do so at the beginning of treatment. In it, the patient agrees to participate in a continuing care plan, with details and contacts established prior to the completion of detoxification. All three components (evaluation, stabiliza\u00adtion, and fostering a patient's entry into treatment) involve treating the patient with compassion and understanding. Patients undergoing detoxification need to know that someone cares about them, respects them as individuals, and has hope for their future. Actions taken during detoxification will demonstrate to the patient that the provider's recommendations can be trusted and fol\u00adlowed. Other Relevant Terms As defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, Text Revision (DSM\u00adIV\u00adTR) (American Psychiatric Association [APA] 2000), a sub\u00ad stance\u00adrelated disorder is a \"disorder related to the taking of a drug of abuse (including alcohol), to the side effects of a medication, and to toxin exposure\" (APA 2000, p. 191). The term substance \"can refer to a drug of abuse, a medication, or a toxin\" (APA 2000, p. 191). In this TIP, the term substance refers to alcohol as well as other drugs of abuse. Substance\u00adrelated disorders are divided into two groups: substance use disorders and sub\u00adstance\u00adinduced disorders. According to the DSM\u00adIV\u00adTR, substance use disorders include both \"substance dependence\" and \"substance abuse.\" Substance dependence refers to \"a cluster of cognitive, behavioral, and physio\u00adlogical symptoms indicating that the individu\u00adal continues use of the substance despite sig\u00adnificant substance\u00adrelated problems. There is a pattern of repeated self\u00adadministration that can result in tolerance, withdrawal, and com\u00adpulsive drug\u00adtaking behavior\" (APA 2000, p. 192). Substance abuse refers to \"a maladap\u00ad tive pattern of substance use manifested by recurrent and significant adverse conse\u00adquences related to the repeated use of sub\u00adstances\" (APA 2000, p. 198). It should be noted that for purposes of this TIP, the term \"substance abuse\" is sometimes used to denote both substance abuse and substance dependence as they are defined by the DSM\u00ad IV\u00adTR. This TIP also uses the DSM\u00adIV\u00adTR definitions for substance intoxication and substance withdrawal. Substance intoxication is \"the development of a reversible substance\u00adspecific syndrome due to the recent ingestion of (or exposure to) a substance\" whereas substance withdrawal is \"the development of a sub\u00ad stance\u00adspecific maladaptive behavioral change, with physiological and cognitive con\u00adcomitants, that is due to the cessation of, or reduction in, heavy and prolonged substance use\" (APA 2000, pp. 199, 201). Figure 1\u00ad1 (p. 6) defines these and other relevant terms. Treatment/rehabilitation includes an ongoing, continual assessment of the patient's physical, psychological, and social status, as well as an analysis of environmental risk factors that may be contributing to substance use and the identification of immediate relapse triggers as well as prevention strategies for coping with them. It also includes the delivery of primary medical care and psychiatric care, if neces\u00adsary, to help the patient abstain from sub\u00adstance use and minimize the physical harm caused by it. Ultimately, the goal of treat\u00adment/rehabilitation is to attain a higher level of social functioning by reducing risk factors, Overview, Essential Concepts, and Definitions in Detoxification 5 Figure 1\u00ad1 DSM\u00adIV\u00adTR Definitions of Terms Term Definition Substance A drug of abuse, a medication, or a toxin. Substance\u00adrelated disorders Disorders related to the taking of a drug of abuse (including alcohol), to the side effects of a medication, and to toxin expo\u00ad sure. Substance abuse (in this TIP, also sometimes used to denote \" substance dependence\") A maladaptive (i.e., harmful to a person's life) pattern of sub\u00ad stance use marked by recurrent and significant negative conse\u00ad quences related to the repeated use of substances. Substance dependence (in this TIP, \" substance abuse\" is sometimes used to include \"dependence\") A cluster of cognitive, behavioral, and physiological symptoms indicating that the individual is continuing use of the substance despite significant substance\u00adrelated problems. A person experi\u00ad encing substance dependence shows a pattern of repeated self\u00ad administration that usually results in tolerance, withdrawal, and compulsive drug\u00adtaking behavior. Substance intoxication The development of a reversible substance\u00adspecific syndrome as the result of the recent ingestion of (or exposure to) a substance. Substance withdrawal The development of a substance\u00adspecific maladaptive behavioral change, usually with uncomfortable physiological and cognitive consequences, that is the result of a cessation of, or reduction in, heavy and prolonged substance use. Source: APA 2000. enhancing protective factors, and thus decreasing the possibility of relapse. Maintenance includes the continuation of counseling and support specified in the treat\u00ad ment plan, refinement and strengthening of strategies to avoid relapse, and engagement in ongoing relapse prevention, aftercare, and/or domiciliary care (Lehman et al. 2000). As a final note, in this TIP persons in need of detoxification services and subsequent sub\u00ad stance abuse treatment are referred to as patients to emphasize that these persons are coming into contact with physicians, nurses, physician assistants, and medical social work\u00aders in a medical setting in which the patient often is physically ill from the effects of with\u00addrawal from specific substances. In some social setting detoxification programs, the terms \"client\" or \"consumer\" may be used in place of \"patient.\" Chapter 1 6 empirically measurable and agreed upon by all Guiding Principles in Detoxification and Substance Abuse Treatment parties. The consensus panel developed guid e\u00ad lines (listed in Figure 1\u00ad2) that serve as the foundation for the TIP. The consensus pan el recognizes that the suc\u00ad cessful delivery of detoxification services is dependent on standards that are to some extent Figure 1\u00ad2 Guiding Principles Recognized by the Consensus Panel 1. Detoxification does not constitute substance abuse treatment but is one part of a continuum of care for substance\u00adrelated disorders. 2. The detoxification process consists of the following three sequential and essential components: Evaluation Stabilization Fostering patient readiness for and entry into treatment A detoxification process that does not incorporate all three critical components is considered incomplete and inadequate by the consensus panel. 3. Detoxification can take place in a wide variety of settings and at a number of levels of intensity within these settings. Placement should be appropriate to the patient's needs. 4. Persons seeking detoxification should have access to the components of the detoxification process described above, no matter what the setting or the level of treatment intensity. 5. All persons requiring treatment for substance use disorders should receive treatment of the same quality and appropriate thoroughness and should be put into contact with a substance abuse treat\u00adment program after detoxification, if they are not going to be engaged in a treatment service provided by the same program that provided them with detoxification services. There can be \"no wrong door to treatment\" for substance use disorders (CSAT 2000 a). 6. Ultimately, insurance coverage for the full range of detoxification services is cost\u00adeffective. If reim\u00adbursement systems do not provide payment for the complete detoxification process, patients may be released prematurely, leading to medically or socially unattended withdrawal. Ensuing medical com\u00ad plications ultimately drive up the overall cost of health care. 7. Patients seeking detoxification services have diverse cultural and ethnic backgrounds as well as unique health needs and life situations. Organizations that provide detoxification services need to ensure that they have standard practices in place to address cultural diversity. It also is essential that care providers possess the special clinical skills necessary to provide culturally competent compre\u00ad hensive assessments. Detoxification program administrators have a duty to ensure that appropriate training is available to staff. (For more information on cultural competency training and specific competencies that clinicians need to be \"culturally competent\" see the forthcoming TIP Improving Cultural Competence in Substance Abuse Treatment [SAMHSA in development a]). 8. A successful detoxification process can be measured, in part, by whether an individual who is sub\u00ad stance dependent enters, remains in, and is compliant with the treatment protocol of a substance abuse treatment/rehabilitation program after detoxification. Overview, Essential Concepts, and Definitions in Detoxification 7 Challenges to Providing Effective Detoxification It is an important challenge for detoxification service providers to find the most effective way to foster a patient's recovery. Effective detoxification includes not only the medical stabilization of the patient and the safe and humane withdrawal from drugs, including alcohol, but also entry into treatment. Successfully linking detoxification with sub\u00adstance abuse treatment reduces the \"revolving door\" phenomenon of repeated withdrawals, saves money in the medium and long run, and delivers the sound and humane level of care patients need (Kertesz et al. 2003). Studies show that detoxification and its linkage to the appropriate levels of treatment lead to increased recovery and decreased use of detoxification and treatment services in the future. In addition, recovery leads to reduc\u00adtions in crime, general healthcare costs, and expensive acute medical and surgical treat\u00adments consequent to untreated substance abuse (Abbot et al. 1998; Aszalos et al. 1999). While detoxification is not treatment per se, its effectiveness can be measured, in part, by the patient's continued abstinence. Another challenge to providing effective detoxification occurs when programs try to develop linkages to treatment services. A study (Mark et al. 2002) conducted for the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration highlights the pitfalls of the service delivery system. According to the authors, each year at least 300,000 patients with substance use disorders or acute intoxi\u00ad cation obtain inpatient detoxification in gen\u00aderal hospitals while additional numbers obtain detoxification in other settings. Only about one\u00adfifth of people discharged from acute care hospitals for detoxification receive substance abuse treatment during that hospi\u00adtalization. Moreover, only 15 percent of peo\u00adple who are admitted through an emergency room for detoxification and then discharged receive any substance abuse treatment. Finally the average length of stay for people undergoing detoxification and treatment in 1997 was only 7.7 days (Mark et al. 2002). Given that \"research has shown that patients who receive continuing care have better out\u00adcomes in terms of drug abstinence and read\u00admission rates than those who do not receive continuing care,\" the report authors conclude that there is a pronounced need for better linkage between detoxification services and the treatment services that are essential for full recovery (Mark et al. 2002, p. 3). Reimbursement systems can present another challenge to providing effective detoxification services (Galanter et al. 2000). Third\u00adparty payors sometimes prefer to manage payment for detoxification separately from other phas\u00ades of addiction treatment, thus treating detox\u00adification as if it occurred in isolation from addiction treatment. This \"unbundling\" of services has promoted the separation of all services into somewhat scattered segments (Kasser et al. 2000). In other instances, some reimbursement and utilization policies dictate that only \"detoxification\" currently can be authorized, and \"detoxification\" for that poli\u00ad cy or insurer does not cover the nonmedical counseling that is an integral part of sub\u00adstance abuse treatment. Many treatment pro\u00adgrams have found substance abuse counselors to be of special help with resistant patients, especially for patients with severe underlying shame over the fact that their substance use is out of control. Yet some payors will not reim\u00adburse for nonmedical services such as those provided by these counselors, and therefore the use of such staff by a detoxification or treatment service may be impossible, in spite of the fact that they are widely perceived as useful for patients. Payors are gradually beginning to understand that detoxification is only one component of a comprehensive treatment strategy. Patient placement criteria, such as those published by the American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) in the Patient Placement Criteria, Second Edition, Revised (ASAM 2001), have come to the fore as clinicians and Chapter 1 8 insurers try to reach agreements on the level of treatment required by a given patient, as well as the medically appropriate setting in which the treatment services are to be deliv\u00adered. Accordingly, the TIP offers suggestions for resolving conflicts as well as clearly defin\u00ading terms used in patient placement and treat\u00adment settings as a step toward clearer under\u00adstanding among interested parties. Overview, Essential Concepts, and Definitions in Detoxification 9 In This Chapter... Role of Various Settings in the Delivery of Services Other Concerns Regarding Levels of Care and Placement 2 Settings, Levels of Care, and Patient Placement Establishing criteria that take into account all the possible needs of patients receiving detoxification and treatment services is an extraordi\u00ad narily complex task. This chapter discusses the criteria for placing patients in the appropriate treatment settings and offering the required intensity of services (i.e., level of care). Role of Various Settings in the Delivery of Services Addiction medicine has sought to develop an efficient system of care that matches patients' clinical needs with the appropriate care setting in the least restrictive and most cost\u00adeffective manner. (For an explanation of least restrictive care, see the text box, p. 12.) Challenges to effective placement matching for clients arise from a number of factors: Deficits in the full range of care settings and levels of care Limitations imposed by third\u00adparty payors (e.g., strict adherence to standardized admission criteria) Clinicians' lack of authority (and sometimes sufficient knowledge) to determine the most appropriate care setting and level of care Insurance that does not have a substance use disorder benefit available as part of its patient coverage Absence of any health insurance at all (Gastfriend et al. 2000) No clear solution or formula to meet these challenges has emerged. 11 Least Restrictive Care Least restrictive refers to patients' civil rights and their right to choice of care. There are four spe\u00ad cific themes of historical and clinical importance: 1. Patients should be treated in those settings that least interfere with their civil rights and freedom to participate in society. 2. Patients should be able to disagree with clinician recommendations for care. While this includes the right to refuse any care at all, it also includes the right to obtain care in a setting of their choice (as long as considerations of dangerousness and mental competency are satisfied). It implies a patient's right to seek a higher or different level of care than that which the clinician has planned. 3. Patients should be informed participants in defining their care plan. Such planning should be done in collaboration with their healthcare providers. 4. Careful consideration of State laws and agency policies is required for patients who are unable to act in their own self\u00adinterests. Because the legal complexities of this issue will vary from State to State the TIP cannot provide definitive guidance here, but providers need to consider whether or not the person is \" gravely\" incapacitated, suicidal, or homicidal; likely to commit grave bodily injury; or, in some States, likely to cause injury to property. In such cases, State law and/or case law may hold providers responsible if they do not commit the patient to care, but in other cases programs may be open to lawsuits for forcibly holding a patient. I n spite of the impediments, some progress has been made in developing comprehensive patient placement criteria. Because the choice of a treatment setting and intensity of treat\u00ad ment (level of care) are so important, the American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) created the Patient Placement Criteria, Second Edition, Revised (PPC\u00ad2R) a consensus\u00adbased clinical tool for matching patients to the appropriate setting and level of care. The ASAM PPC\u00ad2R represents an effort to define how care settings may be matched to patient needs and special characteristics. These criteria currently define the most broadly accepted standard of care for the treatment of substance use disorders. ASAM criteria are intended to provide flexible clinical guidelines; these criteria may not be appropriate for par\u00ad ticular patients or specific care settings. The PPC\u00ad2R identifies six \"assessment dimen\u00ad sions to be evaluated in making placement decisions\" (ASAM 2001, p. 4). They are as follows: 1 . Acute Intoxication and/or Withdrawal Potential 2. Biomedical Conditions and Complications 3. Emotional, Behavioral, or Cognitive Conditions and Complications 4. Readiness to Change 5. Relapse, Continued Use, or Continued Problem Potential 6. Recovery/Living Environment The ASAM PPC\u00ad2R describes both the settings in which services may take place and the inten\u00ad sity of services (i.e., level of care) that patients may receive in particular settings. It is impor\u00ad tant to reiterate, however, that the ASAM PPC\u00ad2R criteria do not characterize all the details that may be essential to the success of treatment (Gastfriend et al. 2000). Moreover, traditional assumptions that certain treatment can be delivered only in a particular setting may not be applicable or valuable to patients. Clinical judgment and consideration of the patient's particular situation are required for appropriate detoxification and treatment. In addition to the general placement criteria for treatment for substance\u00adrelated disorders, ASAM also has developed a second set of place\u00ad Chapter 2 12 ment criteria, which are more important for the purposes of this TIP\u2014the five \"A dult Detoxification\" placement levels of care within Dimension 1 (ASAM 2001). These \" Adult Detoxification\" levels of care are 1. Level I\u00adD: Ambulatory Detoxification Without Extended Onsite Monitoring (e.g., physician's office, home health care agen\u00ad cy). This level of care is an organized out\u00adpatient service monitored at predeter\u00admined intervals. 2. Level II\u00adD: Ambulatory Detoxification With Extended Onsite Monitoring (e.g., day hospital service). This level of care is monitored by appropriately credentialed and licensed nurses. 3. Level III.2\u00adD: Clinically Managed Residential Detoxification (e.g., nonmedi\u00ad cal or social detoxification setting). This level emphasizes peer and social support and is intended for patients whose intoxi\u00adcation and/or withdrawal is sufficient to warrant 24\u00adhour support. 4. Level III.7\u00adD: Medically Monitored Inpatient Detoxification (e.g., freestanding detoxification center). Unlike Level III.2.D, this level provides 24\u00adhour medi\u00adcally supervised detoxification services. 5. Level IV\u00adD: Medically Managed Intensive Inpatient Detoxification (e.g., psychiatric hospital inpatient center). This level pro\u00advides 24\u00adhour care in an acute care inpa\u00adtient settings. As described by the ASAM PPC\u00ad2R, the domain of detoxification refers not only to the reduction of the physiological and psychologi\u00ad cal features of withdrawal syndromes, but also to the process of interrupting the momen\u00adtum of compulsive use in persons diagnosed with substance dependence (ASAM 2001). Because of the force of this momentum and the inherent difficulties in overcoming it even when there is no clear withdrawal syndrome, this phase of treatment frequently requires a greater intensity of services initially to estab\u00ad lish participation in treatment activities and patient role induction. That is, this phase should increase the patient's readiness for and commitment to substance abuse treat\u00adment and foster a solid therapeutic alliance between the patient and care provider. It is important to note that ASAM PPC\u00ad2R criteria are only guidelines, and that there are no uniform protocols for determining which patients are placed in which level of care. For further information on patient placement, readers are advised to consult TIP 13, The Role and Current Status of Patient Placement Criteria in the Treatment of Substance Use Disorders (Center for Substance Abuse Treatment [CSAT] 1995 h). Because this TIP is geared to audiences that may or may not be familiar with the ASAM PPC\u00ad2R levels of care, this section discusses the services and staffing specific to the care settings that are familiar to a broad audience. Physician's Office It has been estimated that nearly one half of the patients who visit a primary care provider have some type of problem related to sub\u00adstance use (Miller and Gold 1998). Indeed, because the physician may be the first point of contact for these people, initiation of treat\u00adment often begins in the family physician's office (Prater et al. 1999). Physicians should use prudence in determining which patients may undergo detoxification safely on an out\u00adpatient basis. As a general rule, outpatient treatment is just as effective as inpatient treatment for patients with mild to moderate withdrawal symptoms (Hayashida 1998). For physicians treating patients with sub\u00ad stance use disorders, preparing the patient to enter treatment and developing a therapeutic alliance between patient and clinician should begin as soon as possible. This includes pro\u00adviding the patient and his family with infor\u00admation on the detoxification process and sub\u00adsequent substance abuse treatment, in addi\u00adtion to providing medical care or referrals if necessary. Staffing should include certified interpreters for the deaf and other language Settings, Levels of Care, and Patient Placement 13 interpreters if the program is serving patients in need of those services. Physicians should be able to accommodate frequent followup visits during the management of acute with\u00addrawal. Medications should be dispensed in limited amounts. Level of care Ambulatory detoxification without extended onsite monitoring This level of detoxification (ASAM's Level I\u00ad D) is an organized outpatient service, which may be delivered in an office setting, health\u00adcare or addiction treatment facility, or in a patient's home by trained clinicians who pro\u00advide medically supervised evaluation, detoxi\u00adfication, and referral services according to a predetermined schedule. Such services are provided in regularly scheduled sessions. These services should be delivered under a defined set of policies and procedures or med\u00adical protocols (ASAM 2001). Ambulatory detoxification is considered appropriate only when a positive and helpful social support network is available to the patient. In this level of care, outpatient detoxification ser\u00advices should be designed to treat the patient's level of clinical severity, to achieve safe and comfortable withdrawal from mood\u00adaltering drugs, and to effectively facilitate the patient's transition into treatment and recov\u00adery. Ambulatory detoxification with extended onsite monitoring Essential to this level of care\u2014and distin\u00adguishing it from Ambulatory Detoxification Without Extended Onsite Monitoring\u2014is the availability of appropriately credentialed and licensed nurses (such as registered nurses [RNs] or licensed practical nurses [LPNs]) who monitor patients over a period of several hours each day of service (ASAM 2001). Otherwise, this level of detoxification (ASAM's Level II\u00adD) also is an organized out\u00adpatient service. Like Level I\u00adD, in this level of care detoxification services are provided in regularly scheduled sessions and delivered under a defined set of policies and procedures or medical protocols. Outpatient services are designed to treat the patient's level of clinical severity and to achieve safe and comfortable withdrawal from mood\u00adaltering drugs, includ\u00ading alcohol, and to effectively facilitate the patient's entry into ongoing treatment and recovery (ASAM 2001). Staffing Although they need not be present in the treatment setting at all times, physicians and nurses are essential to office\u00adbased detoxifica\u00adtion. In States where physician assistants, nurse practitioners, or advance practice clini\u00adcal nurse specialists are licensed as physician extenders, they may perform the duties ordi\u00adnarily carried out by a physician (ASAM 2001). Because detoxification is conducted on an outpatient basis in these settings, it is impor\u00adtant for medical and nursing personnel to be readily available to evaluate and confirm that detoxification in the less supervised setting is safe. All clinicians who assess and treat patients should be able to obtain and inter\u00adpret information regarding the needs of these persons, and all should be knowledgeable about the biomedical and psychosocial dimen\u00adsions of alcohol and illicit drug dependence. Requisite skills and knowledge base include the following: Understanding how to interpret the signs and symptoms of alcohol and other drug intoxica\u00ad tion and withdrawal Understanding the appropriate treatment and monitoring of these conditions The ability to facilitate the individual's entry into treatment It is essential that medical consultation is readily available in emergencies. It is desir\u00adable that medical staff link patients to treat\u00adment services, although this may be an unrea\u00adsonable expectation that cannot be met in a busy office setting. Linkage to treatment ser\u00advices may be provided by the physician or by Chapter 2 14 designated counselors, psychologists, social workers, and acupuncturists who are avail\u00adable either onsite or through the healthcare system (ASAM 2001). Freestanding Urgent Care Center or Emergency Department There are several distinctions between urgent care facilities and emergency rooms (ERs). Urgent care often is used by patients who cannot or do not want to wait until they see their doctor in his or her office, whereas emergency rooms are utilized more often by patients who perceive themselves to be in a crisis situation. Unlike emergency depart\u00adments, which are required to operate 24 hours a day, freestanding urgent care centers usually have specific hours of operation. Staffing for urgent care centers generally is more limited than for an ER. Standard staffing includes only a physician, an RN, a technician, and a secretary. Despite these dis\u00adtinctions, in actual practice there is consider\u00adable overlap between the two\u2014the ER will see medical problems that could be handled by visits to offices, and urgent care facilities will handle some cases of emergency medicine. A freestanding urgent care center or emergen\u00adcy department reasonably can be expected to provide assessment and acute biomedical (including psychiatric) care. However, these settings often are unable to provide satisfacto\u00adry psychosocial stabilization or complete biomedical stabilization (which includes both the initiation and taper of medications used in the treatment of substance withdrawal syn\u00addromes). Appropriate triage and successful linkage to ongoing detoxification services is essential. The ongoing detoxification services may be provided in an inpatient, residential, or outpatient setting. Patients with more than moderate biomedical or psychosocial compli\u00ad cations are more likely to require treatment in an inpatient setting. Care in these settings can be quite costly and should be accessed only when there are serious concerns about a patient's safety. A timely and accurate assessment in an emer\u00adgency department is of the highest impor\u00adtance. This will permit the rapid transfer of the patient to a setting where complete care can be provided. Ideally, personnel in the emergency Although they need not be present in the treatment setting at all times, physicians and nurses are essential to office\u00adbased detoxification. department will have at least a small amount of experi\u00adence and expertise in critically identifying ill substance\u00adusing patients who may be about to experience or are already expe\u00adriencing withdrawal symptoms. Three essential rules apply to emergency depart\u00adments and their han\u00addling of intoxicated patients and patients who have begun to experience with\u00addrawal: Emergency depart\u00ad ments and their clinicians should never simply administer medications to intoxicated persons and then send them home. No intoxicated patient should ever be allowed to leave a hospital setting. All such persons should be referred to the appropriate detoxi\u00ad fication setting if possible, although there are legal restrictions that forbid holding persons against their will under certain conditions (Armenian et al. 1999). A clear distinction must be made between acute intoxication on the one hand and with\u00ad drawal on the other. Acute intoxication, it must be remembered, creates special issues and challenges that need to be addressed. The risk of suicidality in patients who pre\u00ad sent in a state of intoxication needs to be Settings, Levels of Care, and Patient Placement 15 carefully assessed. Because of their volatility and often risky behavior, patients who are intoxicated, as well as those patients who have begun to experience withdrawal, merit special attention. For more on treating intox\u00ad icated patients, see chapter 3. Level of care Care is provided to Inpatient detoxification provides 24\u00adhour supervision, observation, and support for patients who are intoxicated or experiencing withdrawal. patients whose with\u00ad drawal signs and symptoms are suffi\u00ad ciently severe to require primary medical and nursing care services. The services are deliv\u00ad ered under a defined set of physi\u00ad cian\u00admanaged medi\u00ad cally directed assess\u00ad ment and that includes the ini\u00ad tiation of detoxifica\u00ad tion for substance use withdrawal. Neither setting is likely to offer satis\u00ad factory biomedical stabilization or 24\u00ad hour observation. Generally speaking, triage to inpatient care can easily be facilitated from either setting. Freestanding urgent care centers and emer\u00ad gency departments are outpatient settings that are uniquely designed to address the needs of patients in biomedical crisis. For patients with substance use disorders, care in these settings is not complete until successful linkage is made to treatment that is focused specifically on the substance use disorder. To accomplish this, a comprehensive assessment, taking into account psychosocial as well as biomedical issues, is recommended wherever possible. Appreciation of the value of multidimensional patient assessment is central to the clinician's ability to decide which triage (linkage) options are least restrictive and most cost\u00adeffective for a given patient. Staffing Both emergency departments and freestanding urgent care units are staffed by physicians. The same rules regarding who may provide care apply here as they did in the discussion of staffing of office\u00adbased detoxification (ASAM 2001). An RN or other licensed and creden\u00ad tialed nurse is available for primary nursing care and observation. Psychologists, social workers, addiction counselors, and acupunc\u00ad turists usually are not available in these set\u00ad tings. The physician or attending nurse usually facilitates linkage to substance abuse treat\u00ad ment. Freestanding Substance Abuse Treatment or Mental Health Facility Freestanding substance abuse treatment facili\u00ad ties may or may not be equipped to provide adequate assessment and treatment of co\u00ad occurring psychiatric conditions and biopsy\u00ad chosocial problems, as the range of services varies considerably from one facility to anoth\u00ad er. Inpatient mental health facilities, on the other hand, are able generally to provide treat\u00ad ment for substance use disorders and co\u00adoccur\u00ad ring psychiatric conditions. Nonetheless, like substance abuse treatment facilities, the range of available services varies from one mental health facility to another. General guidelines for considering patient placement in either of these settings are pro\u00advided below; however, it should be empha\u00adsized that a clear understanding of the specif\u00adic services that a given setting provides is Chapter 2 16 indispensable to identifying the least restric\u00ad tive and most cost\u00adeffective treatment option that may be available. Concern for safety is of primary importance, and the final decision regarding placement always rests with the treating physician. Level of care Medically Monitored Inpatient Detoxification Inpatient detoxification provides 24\u00adhour supervision, observation, and support for patients who are intoxicated or experiencing withdrawal. Since this level of care is relatively more restrictive and more costly than a resi\u00ad dential treatment option, the treatment mission in this setting should be clearly focused and limited in scope. Primary emphasis should be placed on ensuring that the patient is medically stable (including the initiation and tapering of medications used for the treatment of sub\u00ad stance use withdrawal); assessing for adequate biopsychosocial stability, quickly intervening to establish this adequately; and facilitating effec\u00ad tive linkage to and engagement in other appro\u00ad priate inpatient and outpatient services. Inpatient settings provide medically managed intensive inpatient detoxification. At this level of care, physicians are available 24 hours per day by telephone. A physician should be available to assess the patient within 24 hours of admission (or sooner, if medically neces\u00adsary) and should be available to provide onsite monitoring of care and further evalua\u00ad tion on a daily basis. An RN or other quali\u00adfied nursing specialist should be present to administer an initial assessment. A nurse will be responsible for overseeing the monitoring of the patient's progress and medication administration on an hourly basis, if needed. Appropriately licensed and credentialed staff should be available to administer medications in accordance with physician orders. Clinically Managed Residential Detoxification Residential settings vary greatly in the level of care that they provide. Those with intensive medical supervision involving physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and nurses can handle all but the most demanding compli\u00ad cations of intoxication and withdrawal. On the other hand, some residential settings have min\u00ad imally intensive medical oversight. Residential detoxification in settings with limited medical oversight often is referred to as \"social detoxifi\u00ad cation.\" (Though the \" social detoxification\" model is not limited to residential facilities.) Facilities with lower levels of care should have clear procedures in place for implementing and pursuing appropriate medical referral and linkage, especially in the case of emergencies. For example, a patient who is in danger of seizures or delirium tremens needs to be referred to the appropriate medical facility for acute care of presenting symptoms, possibly medicated, and then returned to a social detox\u00ad ification setting for continuing monitoring and observation. The establishment of this kind of collaborative relationship between institutions provides a good example of a cost\u00adeffective way to provide adequate care to patients. Residential detoxification programs provide 24\u00adhour supervision, observation, and sup\u00ad port for patients who are intoxicated or expe\u00adriencing withdrawal. They are characterized by an emphasis on peer and social support (ASAM 2001). Standards published by such groups as the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) and the Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities (CARF) provide further information on quali\u00adty measures for residential detoxification. Settings, Levels of Care, and Patient Placement 17 Staffing Inpatient detoxification programs employ licensed, certified, or registered clinicians who provide a planned regimen of 24\u00adhour, profes\u00ad sionally directed evaluation, care, and treat\u00ad ment services for patients and their families. An interdisciplinary team of appropriately trained clinicians (such as physicians, RNs and LPNs, counselors, social workers, and psychol\u00ad ogists) should be available to assess and treat the patient and to obtain and interpret infor\u00ad mation regarding the patient's needs. The num\u00ad ber and disciplines of team members should be appropriate to the range and severity of the patient's problems (ASAM 2001). Residential detoxification programs are staffed by appropriately credentialed person\u00adnel who are trained and competent to imple\u00adment physician\u00adapproved protocols for patient observation and supervision. These persons also are responsible for determining the appropriate level of care and facilitating the patient's transition to ongoing care. Medical evaluation and consultation should be available 24 hours a day, in accordance with treatment/transfer practice guidelines. All clinicians who assess and treat patients should be able to obtain and interpret infor\u00admation regarding the needs of these persons and should be knowledgeable about the biomedical and psychosocial dimensions of alcohol and other drug dependence. Such knowledge includes awareness of the signs and symptoms of alcohol and other drug intoxication and withdrawal, as well as the appropriate treatment and monitoring of those conditions and how to facilitate the individual's entry into ongoing care. Staff should ensure that patients are taking medi\u00adcations according to their physician's orders and legal requirements (ASAM 2001). Some residential detoxification programs are staffed to supervise self\u00adadministered medica\u00ad tions for the management of withdrawal. All such programs should rely on established clinical protocols to identify patients who have biomedical needs that exceed the capaci\u00adty of the facility and to identify which pro\u00adgrams will likely have a need for transferring such patients to more appropriate treatment settings. Intensive Outpatient and Partial Hospitalization Programs An intensive outpatient program (IOP) or par\u00ad tial hospitalization program (PHP) is appropri\u00ad ate for patients with mild to moderate with\u00ad drawal symptoms. Thorough psychosocial assessment and intervention should be avail\u00ad able in addition to biomedical assessment and stabilization. Many of these programs have close clinical and/or administrative ties to hos\u00ad pital centers. When needed, triage to a higher level of care should be easy to accomplish. Outpatient treatment should be delivered in conjunction with all components of detoxifica\u00ad tion. Level of care This level of detoxification is an organized out\u00ad patient service that requires patients to be pre\u00ad sent onsite for several hours a day. It is thus similar to a physician's office in that ambulato\u00ad ry detoxification with extended onsite monitor\u00ad ing is provided. Unlike the physician's office, in the IOP and PHP it is standard practice to have a multidisciplinary team available to pro\u00ad vide or facilitate linkage to a range of medically supervised evaluation, detoxification, and referral services. Detoxification services also are provided in regularly scheduled sessions and delivered under a defined set of policies and procedures or medical protocols. These outpatient ser\u00advices are designed to treat the patient's level of clinical severity, to achieve safe and com\u00adfortable withdrawal from mood\u00adaltering drugs (including alcohol), and to effectively facili\u00ad Chapter 2 18 tate the patient's engagement in ongoing treat\u00ad ment and recovery (ASAM 2001). A partial hospitalization program may occupy the same setting (i.e., physical space) as an acute care inpatient treatment program. Although occupying the same space, the levels of care provided by these two programs are distinct yet complementary. Acute care inpa\u00adtient programs provide detoxification services to patients in danger of severe withdrawal and who therefore need the highest level of medically managed intensive care, including access to life support equipment and 24\u00adhour medical support. In contrast, partial hospital\u00adization programs provide services to patients with mild to moderate symptoms of withdraw\u00adal that are not likely to be severe or life\u00adthreatening and that do not require 24\u00adhour medical support. The transition from an acute care inpatient program to either a par\u00adtial hospitalization or intensive outpatient program sometimes is referred to as a \"step\u00ad down.\" Typically, whether these programs share space and staff with an acute care inpa\u00adtient program or are physically distinct from a hospital structure, they have close clinical and/or administrative ties to hospital centers. Collaborative working relationships are indis\u00adpensable in pursuing the goal of providing patients with the most appropriate level of care in the most cost\u00adeffective setting. Staffing IOPs and PHPs should be staffed by physi\u00adcians who are available daily as active mem\u00ad bers of an interdisciplinary team of appropri\u00ad ately trained professionals and who medically manage the care of the patient. An RN or other licensed and credentialed nurse should be available for primary nursing care and observation during the treatment day. Addiction counselors or licensed or registered addiction clinicians should be available to administer planned interventions according to the assessed needs of the patient. The multi\u00addisciplinary professionals (such as physicians, nurses, counselors, social workers, psycholo\u00ad gists, and acupuncturists) should be available as an interdisciplinary team to assess and care for the patient with a substance\u00adrelated disorder, as well as patients with both a sub\u00adstance use disorder and a co\u00adoccurring biomedical, emotional, or behavioral condi\u00adtion. Successful linkage to treatment for the substance use disorder (in addition to biomedical stabilization) is central to the mis\u00adsion of an intensive outpatient or partial hospitalization pro\u00adgram (ASAM 2001). Successful linkage to treatment for the substance use disorder (in addition to biomedical stabilization) is central to the mission of an intensive out\u00ad patient or partial hospitalization program. For more informa\u00adtion, see the TIP Substance Abuse: Clinical Issues in Intensive Outpatient Treatment [SAMHSA in development d]. Acute Care Inpatient Settings There are several types of acute care inpatient settings. They include Acute care general hospitals Acute care addic\u00ad tion treatment units in acute care gener\u00ad al hospitals Acute care psychi\u00ad atric hospitals Other appropriately licensed chemical dependency special\u00ad ty hospitals These settings share the ready availability of acute care medical and nursing staff, life sup\u00ad port equipment, and ready access to the full resources of an acute care general hospital or its psychiatric unit. This level of care provides medically managed intensive inpatient detoxifi\u00ad cation (ASAM 2001). Settings, Levels of Care, and Patient Placement 19 Level of care Acute inpatient care is an organized service that provides medically monitored inpatient detoxification that is delivered by medical and nursing professionals. Medically supervised evaluation and withdrawal management in a permanent facility with inpatient beds is pro\u00ad vided for patients whose withdrawal signs and symptoms are sufficiently severe to require 24\u00ad hour inpatient care. Services should be deliv\u00ad ered under a set of policies and procedures or clinical protocols designated and approved by a qualified physician (ASAM 2001). Staffing Acute care inpatient detoxification programs typically are staffed by physicians who are available 24 hours a day as active members of an interdisciplinary team of appropriately trained professionals and who medically man\u00ad age the care of the patient. In some States, these duties may be performed by an RN or physician assistant. An RN or LPN, as usual, is available for primary nursing care and obser\u00ad vation 24 hours a day. Facility\u00adapproved addic\u00ad tion counselors or licensed or registered addic\u00ad tion clinicians should be available 8 hours a day to administer planned interventions according to the assessed needs of the patient. An interdisciplinary team of appropriately trained clinicians (such as physicians, nurses, counselors, social workers, and psychologists) should be available to assess and treat the patient with a substance\u00adrelated disorder, or a patient with co\u00adoccurring substance use, biomedical, psychological, or behavioral condi\u00ad tions (ASAM 2001). Other Concerns Regarding Levels of Care and Placement In part because of the need to keep costs to a minimum and in part as the result of research in the field, outpatient detoxification is becom\u00ad ing the standard for treatment of symptoms of withdrawal from substance dependence in many locales. Most alcohol treatment programs have found that more than 90 percent of patients with withdrawal symptoms can be treated as outpatients (Abbott et al. 1995). Careful screening of these patients is essential to reserve for inpatient treatment those clients with possibly complicated withdrawal; for example, patients with subacute medical or psychiatric conditions (that in and of them\u00ad selves would not require hospitalization) and those in danger of seizures or delirium tremens should receive inpatient care. Inpatient addic\u00ad tion treatment programs will vary in the level of acute medical or psychiatric care that can be provided. Figure 2\u00ad1 presents an overview of issues to consider in deciding between inpatient and outpatient detoxification. ASAM criteria are being adopted extensively on the basis of their \"face validity,\" though their outcome validity has yet to be clinically proven. Early studies of more versus less restrictive and intensive treatment settings on randomized samples generally have failed to show group differences, and studies continue to show this pattern (Gastfriend et al. 2000). Whether patients undergoing detoxification will have better results as outpatients rather than as inpatients remains to be established (Hayashida 1998). Another consideration is that ASAM place\u00adment guidelines are not always the best guide to placing a patient in the proper setting at the proper level. For example, what is the clinician to do with the patient who qualifies for outpatient treatment according to the ASAM guidelines but is homeless in sub\u00adzero temperatures? No provision is made for such cases. The ASAM guidelines are to be regard\u00aded as a \"work in progress,\" as their authors readily admit (ASAM 2001, p. 19). Nevertheless, they are an important set of guidelines that are of great help to clinicians. For administrators, the standards published Chapter 2 20 Figure 2\u00ad1 Issues To Consider in Determining Whether Inpatient or Outpatient Detoxification Is Preferred Considerations Indications Ability to arrive at clinic on a daily basis Necessary if outpatient detoxification is to be car\u00ad ried out History of previous delirium tremens or withdraw\u00adal seizures Contraindication to outpatient detoxification: recurrence likely; specific situation may suggest that an attempt at outpatient detoxification is pos\u00adsible No capacity for informed consent Protective environment (inpatient) indicated Suicidal/homicidal/psychotic condition Protective environment (inpatient) indicated Able/willing to follow treatment recommendations Protective environment (inpatient) indicated if unable to follow recommendations Co\u00adoccurring medical conditions Unstable medical conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, or pregnancy: all relatively strong contraindications to outpatient detoxification Supportive person to assist Not essential but advisable for outpatient detoxifi\u00adcation Source: Consensus Panelist Sylvia Dennison, M.D. by such groups as JCAHO and CARF offer guidance for overall program operations. It has become clear that detoxification involves much more than simply medically withdrawing a patient from alcohol or other drugs. Detoxification, whether done on an inpatient, residential, or outpatient basis, fre\u00adquently is the initial therapeutic encounter between patient and clinician. Irrespective of the substance involved, a detoxification episode should provide an opportunity for biomedical (including psychiatric) assess\u00adment, referral for appropriate services, and linkage to treatment services. Chapter 3 pro\u00advides an overview of the psychosocial and biomedical issues relevant to detoxification, strategies to engage the patient, and an overview of providing adequate linkage to fol\u00adlow up treatment and services. Settings, Levels of Care, and Patient Placement 21 In This Chapter... Evaluating and Addressing Psychosocial and Biomedical Issues Strategies for Engaging and Retaining Patients in Detoxification Referrals and Linkages 3 An Overview of Psychosocial and Biomedical Issues During Detoxification Regardless of setting or level of care, the goals of detoxification are to provide safe and humane withdrawal from substances and to foster the patient's entry into long\u00adterm treatment and recovery. Detoxification presents a unique opportunity to intervene during a period of crisis and move a client to make changes in the direction of health and recovery. Hence, a primary goal of the detoxification staff should be to build the therapeutic alliance and motivate the patient to enter treatment. This process should begin even as the patient is being medically stabilized (Onken et al. 1997). Psychological dependence, co\u00adoccurring psychiatric and medical con\u00ad ditions, social supports, and environmental conditions critically influ\u00adence the probability of successful and sustained abstinence from sub\u00adstances. Research indicates that addressing psychosocial issues during detoxification significantly increases the likelihood that the patient will experience a safe detoxification and go on to participate in sub\u00ad stance abuse treatment. Staff members' ability to respond to patients' needs in a compassionate manner can make the difference between a return to substance abuse and the beginning of a new (and more posi\u00ad tive) way of life. This chapter addresses the psychosocial and biomedical issues that may affect detoxification and ensuing treatment. It highlights evaluation pro\u00ad cedures for patients undergoing detoxification, discusses strategies for engaging and retaining patients in detoxification and preparing them for treatment, and presents an overview for providing linkages to other services. 23 Overarching Principles for Care During Detoxification Services Detoxification services do not offer a \" cure\" for substance use disorders. They often are a first step toward recovery and the \"first door\" through which patients pass to treatment. S ubstance use disorders are treatable, and there is hope for recovery. Substance use disorders are brain disorders and not evidence of moral weaknesses. Patients are treated with respect and dignity at all times. Patients are treated in a nonjudgmental and supportive manner. Services planning is completed in partnership with the patient and his or her social support network, including such persons as family, significant others, or employers. All health professionals involved in the care of the patient will maximize opportunities to promote rehabili\u00ad tation and maintenance activities and to link her or him to appropriate substance abuse treatment imme\u00ad diately after the detoxification phase. Active involvement of the family and other support systems while respecting the patient's rights to privacy and confidentiality is encouraged. Patients are treated with due consideration for individual background, culture, preferences, sexual orien\u00ad tation, disability status, vulnerabilities, and strengths. Evaluating and Addressing Psychosocial and Biomedical Issues Patients entering detoxification are undergoing profound personal and medical crisis. Withdrawal itself can cause or exacerbate cur\u00ad rent emotional, psychological, or mental prob\u00ad lems. The detoxification staff needs to be equipped to identify and address potential problems. Considerations for Conducting the Initial Evaluation An initial evaluation will help detoxification staff foresee any variables that might compli\u00ad cate a safe and effective withdrawal. Figure 3\u00ad1 lists the biomedical and psychosocial domains that can affect the stabilization of the patient. The following sections include some general guidelines and important considerations to follow when providing detoxification services. General Guidelines for Addressing Immediate Medical Concerns Because substance abuse affects all systems of the body and is associated with lack of self\u00ad care, it is not unusual for detoxification to be complicated by medical problems. Health pro\u00ad fessionals should screen for medical problems that may put the client at risk for a medical cri\u00ad sis or expose other clients or staff to contagious diseases. This section outlines important con\u00ad siderations for both nonmedical and medical staff. Chapter 5 provides a clinical overview of co\u00adoccurring medical conditions and is geared primarily toward medical personnel. Co\u00adoccurring medical conditions The initial consultation should include an eval\u00ad uation of the expected signs, symptoms, and severity of the withdrawal. Detoxification is not an exact science, but any significant deviation from the expected course of withdrawal should be observed closely. Figure 3\u00ad2 (p. 26) provides Chapter 3 24 Figure 3\u00ad1 Initial Biomedical and Psychosocial Evaluation Domains Biomedical Domains General health history \u2014What is the patient's medical and surgical history? Are there any psychi\u00ad atric or medical conditions? Are there known medication allergies? Is there a history of seizures? Mental status \u2014Is the patient oriented, alert, cooperative? Are thoughts coherent? Are there signs of psychosis or destructive thoughts? General physical assessment with neurological exam \u2014This will ascertain the patient's general health and identify any medical or psychiatric disorders of immediate concern. Temperature, pulse, blood pressure \u2014These are important indicators and should be monitored throughout detoxification. Patterns of substance abuse \u2014When did the patient last use? What were the substances of abuse? How much of these substances was used and how frequently? Urine toxicology screen for commonly abused substances . Past substance abuse treatments or detoxification \u2014This should include the course and number of previous withdrawals, as well as any complications that may have occurred. Psychosocial Domains Demographic features \u2014Gather information on gender, age, ethnicity, culture, language, and educa\u00ad tional level. Living conditions \u2014Is the patient homeless or living in a shelter? What is the living situation? Are sig\u00ad nificant others in the home (and, if so, can they safely supervise)? Violence, suicide risk \u2014Is the patient aggressive, depressed, or hopeless? Is there a history of vio\u00ad lence? Transportation \u2014Does the patient have adequate means to get to appointments? Do other arrange\u00ad ments need to be made? Financial situation \u2014Is the patient able to purchase medications and food? Does the patient have adequate employment and income? Dependent children \u2014Is the patient able to care for children, provide adequate child care, and ensure the safety of children? Legal status\u2014Is the patient a legal resident? Are there pending legal matters? Is treatment court ordered? Physical, sensory, or cognitive disabilities \u2014Does the client have disabilities that require considera\u00ad tion? a list of signs and symptoms of conditions that require immediate medical attention. All staff members who work with patients should be aware of these and seek medical consultation for the patients as necessary. S eizures are of special concern. Practitioners should interview the patient and family about seizure disorders and seizure history. In addi\u00ad tion, nonmedical staff should be aware of signs of impending seizures such as tremors, An Overview of Psychosocial and Biomedical Issues During Detoxification 25 Figure 3\u00ad2 Symptoms and Signs of Conditions That Require Immediate Medical Attention Change in mental status Increasing anxiety and panic Hallucinations Seizures Temperature greater than 100.4\u00b0 F (these patients should be considered potentially infectious) Significant increases and/or decreases in blood pressure and heart rate Insomnia Abdominal pain Upper and lower gastrointestinal bleeding Changes in responsiveness of pupils Heightened deep tendon reflexes and ankle clonus, a reflex beating of the foot when pressed rostrally (i.e., toward the mouth of the patient), indicating profound central nervous system irritability and the potential for seizures inc reased blood pressure, overactive reflexes, and high temperature and pulse. It is essential that nonmedical staff be trained in protocols to prevent injury in the event of a seizure. Competence in carrying out these protocols should be evaluated by a physician or nurse clinician. For more information on seizures, see chapter 4. All staff working with patients should be familiar with medical disorders that are asso\u00ad ciated with various addictive substances or routes of administration. Alcoholism has mul\u00adtiple organ effects involving the liver, pan\u00adcreas, central nervous system, cardiovascular system, and endocrine system. Cocaine pro\u00ad duces many of its medical complications through vasoconstriction (i.e., narrowing of the blood vessels), including myocardial infarction (heart attack), stroke, renal dis\u00adease, spontaneous abortion, and even bowel infarction (death of tissue). Cocaine also can cause seizures and cardiac arrhythmia (irreg\u00ad ular heartbeat). A heroin overdose can lead to a fatal respiratory depression. Intravenous drug use is particularly likely to increase the risk of infectious complications, including HIV, viral hepatitis, abscesses, and sepsis (the spreading of infection from its original site in the body). Intrapulmonary (within the lungs) administration can cause lung disorders (Dackis and Gold 1991). Nonmedical detoxifi\u00adcation staff also should be aware of the medi\u00adcations used in detoxification, medications for common medical and psychiatric disorders, and signs of common medication reactions and interactions. Infectious disease Standard precautions should be used with all patients to protect the staff and patients against the transmission of infectious diseases, includ\u00ad ing HIV and hepatitis A, B, and C. All open wounds should be cultured and treated to pre\u00ad vent the spread of infections. Providers should use HIV/blood and respiratory infection pre\u00ad cautions until HIV and respiratory infectious status are known. Patients with respiratory infections should be carefully evaluated. The panel suggests that tuberculin testing be per\u00ad formed or recent test results obtained on all patients to screen for active tuberculosis. A chest x\u00adray is recommended if indicated by the Chapter 3 26 patient's history and physical assessments. Nonmedical detoxification staff should be trained to watch for the signs of common infec\u00ad tious diseases passed through casual contact, including infestation with scabies and lice. General Guidelines for Addressing Immediate Mental Health Needs The following section provides general guide\u00ad lines for treating patients who have immediate mental health needs. For more detailed infor\u00admation on the treatment of patients with co\u00adoccurring psychiatric conditions see TIP 42, Substance Abuse Treatment for Persons With Co\u00adOccurring Disorders (Center for Substance Abuse Treatment [CSAT] 2005 c). Suicide Those who are users of multiple illicit sub\u00ad stance are more likely to experience psychiatric disorders, and the risk is highest among those who use both opiates and benzodiazepines and/or alcohol (Marsden et al. 2000). Depression is more common among those who abuse a combination of these substances, and women are at higher risk than men. Among those patients who are positive for depression, the risk of suicide is high. Marsden and col\u00ad leagues' 2000 study of 1,075 clients entering treatment showed that 29 percent reported sui\u00ad cidal ideation in the past 3 months. During acute intoxication and withdrawal, it is important to provide an environment that minimizes the opportunities for suicide attempts. As a precaution, locations not clearly visible to staff should be free of items that might be used for suicide attempts. Frequent safety checks should be implement\u00ad ed; the frequency of these checks should be increased when signs of depression, shame, guilt, helplessness, worthlessness, and hope\u00ad lessness are present. When feasible, patients at risk for suicide should be placed in areas that are easily monitored by staff. Most important, when interacting with patients at risk for suicide, staff should avoid harsh con\u00adfrontation and judgment and instead focus on the treatable nature of substance use disor\u00adders and the rehabilitation options available. These interactions offer an opportunity to start a dialog with the patient regarding the impact of substance use on mental illness and vice versa. Anger and aggression Alcohol, cocaine, amphetamine, and hallu\u00adcinogen intoxication may be associated with increased risk of violence. Symptoms associ\u00adated with this increased risk for violence include hallucinations, paranoia, anxiety, and depression. As a precaution, all patients who are intoxicated should be considered poten\u00adtially violent (Miller et al. 1994). Programs should have in place well\u00addeveloped plans to promote staff and patient safety, including protocols for response by local law enforce\u00adment agencies or security contractors. Staff working in detoxification programs should be trained in techniques to de\u00adescalate anger and aggression. In many cases, aggressive behav\u00adiors can be defused through verbal and envi\u00adronmental means (Reilly and Shopshire 2002). For the protection of the staff and the patient, physical restraint should be used as a last resort and programs should be aware of local laws and regulations pertaining to physi\u00adcal restraint. Figure 3\u00ad3 (p. 28) lists some use\u00adful ways of managing patients who are angry and aggressive. Readers may refer to the standards published by such groups as the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) and the Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities (CARF) for further guidance. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) also has published guidelines on the use of seclusion and restraint, which call for the reduction and possible elimination of their use (SAMHSA 2002). An Overview of Psychosocial and Biomedical Issues During Detoxification 27 Figure 3\u00ad3 Strategies for De\u00adescalating Aggressive Behaviors Speak in a soft voice. Isolate the individual from loud noises or distractions. Provide reassurance and avoid confrontation, judgments, or angry tones. Enlist the assistance of family members or others who have a relationship of trust. Offer medication when appropriate. Separate the individual from others who may encourage or support the aggressive behaviors. Enlist additional staff members to serve as visible backup if the situation escalates. Have a clearly developed plan to enlist the support of law enforcement or security staff if necessary. Establish clear admission protocols in order to help screen for potentially aggressive/violent patients. Determine one's own level of comfort during interaction with the patient and respect personal limits. Ensure that neither the clinician's nor the patient's exit from the examination room is blocked. Co\u00adoccurring mental disorders With the patient's consent, a review of the patient's mental health history with the patient and family is useful in identifying co\u00adoccurring psychiatric conditions. Mental health profes\u00ad sionals caring for the client should be consult\u00ad ed. If a pharmacy profile on the patient is available, it should be copied for review (within the confines of State and Federal confidentiali\u00ad ty laws). Diagnosis of co\u00adoccurring substance\u00adrelated disorders and mental conditions is difficult during acute intoxication and withdrawal because it often is impossible to be precise until the clinical picture allows for the full assess\u00ad ment of both the effects of substance use and of the symptoms of mental disorders. As the indi\u00ad vidual moves from severe to moderate with\u00ad drawal symptoms, attention to differential diagnosis of substance use disorders and other psychiatric disorders becomes a priority (First et al. 2002). The American Psychiatric Association (APA) and the American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) guidelines recom\u00ad mend a period of 2 to 4 weeks of abstinence before attempting to diagnose a psychiatric dis\u00ad order (APA 2000; ASAM 2001). General Guidelines for Addressing Nutritional Concerns Malnutrition is a major concern for patients entering detoxification because the nutrient deficiencies associated with substance abuse can interfere with or even prolong the detoxifi\u00ad cation process (Nazrul Islam et al. 2001). Longstanding irregular eating habits and poor dietary intake only exacerbate the problem (Pelican et al. 1994). The detoxification process itself is stressful to the body and may result in increased nutrient requirements. Proper nutri\u00ad tion during recovery improves to a significant extent the adverse effects of the substance abuse (Nazrul Islam et al. 2001). Nutritional evaluation An evaluation of nutritional status should be a core component of detoxification. It should be noted, however, that for patients who abuse alcohol, the administration of fluids to address dehydration should be the first step, with nutritional evaluation occurring after the patient is adequately hydrated. Chapter 3 28 The nutritional evaluation should consist of laboratory and anthropometric indices, a detailed nutritional history, and nutrition counseling (Simko et al. 1995). The interven\u00ad tion begins in the initial acute phase of with\u00ad drawal and continues through detoxification and subsequent substance abuse treatment. If the patient consents, family members or signifi\u00ad cant others may be included in the nutritional evaluation and counseling. Weight is an important consideration in deter\u00ad mining the nutritional status of the person with a substance use disorder. Substance abuse may result in a reduction in food intake and disrup\u00ad tion in the patient's metabolism that may in turn have caused an eating disorder, weight loss, and malnutrition. Conversely, weight gain may be related to inactivity and an excessive intake of highly refined carbohydrates (Zador et al. 1996). Patients should be asked whether there have been any recent changes in their weight. While a patient may appear to be ade\u00ad quately nourished, a skinfold caliper (an instrument that measures the thickness of a fold of skin with its underlying layer of fat) can determine body density (the relationship of the body's mass to its volume), though the body mass index may be a better indicator of nutri\u00ad tional status (Simko et al. 1995). Other questions to ask during the initial evalu\u00ad ation concern appetite, eating patterns, food preferences, snacking habits, food allergies, food intolerance, special diets, and foods to be avoided because of cultural or religious beliefs. A food frequency questionnaire, food diary, or 24\u00adhour food recall may be of use. Many drug addictions are associated with abnormal glucose (sugar) metabolism. This abnormality means that the body is unable to maintain a stable concentration of glucose in the blood. Abnormally high or low blood sugar levels easily can be confused with the signs and symptoms of alcohol intoxication or withdraw\u00ad al; consequently, a check of blood glucose level is particularly important in patients with a his\u00ad tory of blood sugar abnormalities. Hypogly\u00ad cemia (low levels of blood sugar) in the person with a substance use disorder may lead to dras\u00ad tic mood changes. When blood glucose levels drop below a certain threshold, these patients usually feel depressed, anxious, or moody and may experience cravings for their drug of choice. Nutritional deficits associated with specific substances As noted, the abuse of drugs can interfere with nutrient utilization and storage. Detoxification personnel should be familiar with the nutrition\u00ad al deficits associated with specific substances. Opioids are known to decrease calcium absorp\u00ad tion and to increase cholesterol and body potassium levels. Magnesium deficiency often is seen in chronic alcohol dependence. Other nutrient deficiencies seen in alcohol abuse include protein, fat, zinc, calcium, iron, vita\u00ad mins A and E, and the water\u00adsoluble vitamins pyridoxine, thiamine, folate, and vitamin B12 (Nazrul Islam al. 2001). Alcohol also con\u00ad tains calories (7 kcal/gm) that when consumed in excessive amounts may displace nutrient\u00ad dense foods. Cocaine is an appetite suppressant and may interfere with the absorption of calci\u00ad um and vitamin D. Laboratory tests for pro\u00ad tein, vitamins, and iron and the other elec\u00ad trolytes are recommended to determine the extent of liver function as well as supplementa\u00ad tion (Fontaine et al. 2001). Caution should be exercised when using supplements because of their potential interactions with other drugs and treatments. Addressing nutritional deficits Detoxification should include efforts to address nutritional deficits and to begin the patient on a course of improved eating habits. It is crucial to switch the paradigm from ingesting sub\u00ad stances harmful to the body to taking in foods that heal the body (Nebelkopf 1981, 1987, 1988). The regularity of meal times, taste, and presentation are important considerations. An Overview of Psychosocial and Biomedical Issues During Detoxification 29 Attractively arranged, pleasant\u00adtasting food may inspire the patient to consume vital nutri\u00ad ents and adequate calories. It is important that during the detoxification process, the patient avoid substituting one addiction for another. Consuming excessive amounts of caffeine or sugar can compromise the process and lead to relapse. Patients should be offered only decaf\u00ad feinated beverages and healthful snacks instead of refined carbohydrates such as sugar\u00adbased sweets like candy, cookies, or donuts. Fresh fruits, vegetables, and other whole foods can contribute to the individual's health and well\u00ad ness. Gastrointestinal disturbances (i.e., nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea) may accompany the first phase of detoxification. Such distur\u00adbances can worsen dehydration and may dis\u00adturb blood chemistry balance, which in turn can lead to mental status changes, neurologi\u00adcal or heart problems, and other potentially dangerous medical conditions. Patients with gastrointestinal disturbances may only be able to tolerate clear liquids. When solid foods are tolerated, balanced meals consisting of low\u00adfat foods, with an increased intake of protein (meat, dairy products, legumes), com\u00adplex carbohydrates (whole grain bread and cereals), and dietary fiber are recommended (Duyff 1996). Patients undergoing detoxifica\u00adtion may also experience constipation. Increasing the fiber content of the diet will help to alleviate this discomfort. Considerations for patients with special dietary requirements Patients with special dietary requirements need additional nutrition therapy. A person with diabetes, for example, should follow the dietary guidelines of the American Diabetes Association, which emphasizes individualized meal planning (American Diabetes Association 2004). A patient who is a vegetarian may have additional nutritional deficiencies, especially if she or he is a vegan (i.e., a person who avoids eating all foods derived from animals, including milk products and eggs). If a vegan enters detoxification with marginal or low nutrient stores, his or her diet should be augmented with legumes, meat analogs, textured vegetable protein, nuts, and seeds. Many other medical conditions (e.g., ulcers, heart disease, food allergies, etc.) may require special diets. At intake, any special dietary considerations should be noted. Considerations for Intoxication and Withdrawal in Adolescents Generally, detoxification is the same for adoles\u00ad cents as it is for adult clients. However, there are a few important and unique considerations for adolescent patients. For one, adolescents are more likely than adults to drink large quantities of alcohol in a short period of time, making it is especially important that detoxifi\u00ad cation providers be alert to escalating blood alcohol levels in these patients. Moreover, ado\u00ad lescents are more likely than adults to use drugs they cannot identify, to combine multiple substances with alcohol, to ingest unidentified substances, and to be unwilling to disclose drug use (Westermeyer 1997). As a result, the con\u00ad sensus panel recommends routinely screening adolescent patients for illicit drug intoxication. It also is important for staff to be trained in how to assess for the use of PCP, which can present with psychosis\u00adlike symptoms. Staff should ask the adolescent directly whether he has used PCP within the 12\u00adhour period before entering the clinic or treatment center. Adolescents should be placed in a secure, clean environment with observation and sup\u00adportive care. If alcohol, heroin, or other drugs associated with vomiting are suspected, protecting the individual's airway and posi\u00adtioning the patient on his or her side to avoid aspiration (inhaling) of stomach contents are critical. In severe cases of ingestion of respi\u00adratory depressants, respiratory support may be needed. If the individual is severely com\u00adbative or belligerent, physical restraint may be needed as a last resort when allowed and Chapter 3 30 appropriate. In milder cases, observation in a quiet, secure room with compassionate reas\u00adsurance may be sufficient. Additionally, ado\u00adlescents served in adult settings should be separated from the adult population and observed closely to ensure that they are not victimized (i.e., verbally, physically, or sexu\u00adally) by adult clients. Finally, adolescents in detoxification settings should always be screened carefully for suicide potential and co\u00adoccurring psychiatric problems. It sometimes is challenging to establish rap\u00adport with adolescents, as their experience with adults may be marked by adverse conse\u00adquences. Asking open\u00adended questions and using street terminology for drugs and other expressions commonly used by teenagers can be helpful both in establishing rapport and in obtaining an accurate substance use history. For more information on working with ado\u00adlescents, see TIP 31, Screening and Assessing Adolescents for Substance Use Disorders (CSAT 1999d), and TIP 32, Treatment of Adolescents With Substance Use Disorders (CSAT 1999f). Considerations for Patients Who Are Parents With Dependent Children For parents\u2014especially women\u2014entering detoxification programs, the safety of children often is a concern and one of the biggest barri\u00ad ers to retention. Even if women do not have custody of their children they often are the ones who continue to care for them. Some chil\u00ad dren may show extreme need for their mother while separated from her, and their demands could trigger unauthorized leave from detoxifi\u00ad cation. Thus, ensuring that children have a safe place to stay while their mothers are in detoxification is of vital importance. Working with women and men to identify supportive family or friends may identify temporary child\u00ad care resources. A consult or referral to the treatment facility's social services while the patient is being detoxified is indicated when the care of children is uncertain. Considerations for Victims of Domestic Violence While both men and women are victims of domestic abuse, women's substance use is asso\u00ad ciated with increased risk of intimate partner violence (Cunradi et al. 2002). Staff should know the signs of domestic violence and be pre\u00ad pared to follow proce\u00ad dures to ensure the safety of the patient. If a patient discloses a history of domestic Ensuring that children have a safe place to stay while their mothers are in detoxificaton is of vital importance. violence, trained staff can help the victim create a long\u00adterm safety plan or make a proper refer\u00adral. If a safety plan is made or phone numbers for domes\u00adtic violence help are provided, related information should be labeled carefully so as not to disclose its purpose (e.g., list\u00aded as women's health resources) since the abuser may go through all personal belongings. All print\u00aded information about domestic violence also should be disguised and none should be kept by the patient when she leaves the safe facili\u00adty. If the victim needs to press charges or obtain a restraining order, this should be done from a safe setting (e.g., inpatient detox\u00adification). If at all possible, the victim should be escorted to a safety shelter. It may be important that the abused person, whether male or female, not be allowed to talk to the abuser while in detoxification. Parents who are victims of domestic violence may need help with parenting skills and securing coun\u00adseling and childcare. Therefore, it is impor\u00adtant for detoxification providers to be famil\u00adiar with local childcare resources. For more An Overview of Psychosocial and Biomedical Issues During Detoxification 31 information see TIP 25, Substance Abuse Treatment and Domestic Violence (CSAT 1997b). Considerations for Culturally Diverse Patients In providing psychosocial supports for cultur\u00ad ally diverse patients, cultural sensitivity is of tremendous importance. Clients' expectations of detoxification, their feelings about the healthcare system generally, and their social and community support structures vary according to their cultural backgrounds. In working with any specific population, the prac\u00ad titioner should avoid defining the patient in terms of his culture, since over\u00ador underem\u00ad phasizing the patient's race or ethnicity can be detrimental (Clark et al. 1998). Figure 3\u00ad4 pro\u00ad Figure 3\u00ad4 Questions To Guide Practitioners To Better Understand the Patient's Cultural Framework What language do you prefer we use? Therapists and clients sometimes have different ideas about diseases, can you tell me more about your idea of why you are in detoxification now? Do you require assistance for daily living activities (such as personal hygiene, shopping, paying bills, etc.)? What do you call your present condition/situation (as it relates to substance use)? How does your family view your present condition/situation (as it relates to substance use)? What is the role of alcohol or drugs in your family? How does your community view your present condition/situation (as it relates to substance use)? Or what is the role of alcohol or drugs in your community? How has your present condition/situation (as it relates to substance use) altered your status in the community? What experiences have you had with the healthcare system? Do you think your substance use is a problem for you? What do you think caused your present condition/situation (as it relates to substance use)? Why do you think it started? What is going on in your body? How has your present condition/situation (as it relates to substance use) altered your life? How have you tried to solve the problem(s) associated with substance use in the past? Was it helpful? What worked/didn't work? Why are you coming now? Are you on any herbal medications or special foods for this problem? What concerns or fears do you have about your present condition/situation (as it relates to substance use)? What concerns or fears do you have about this treatment? Source: Adapted from Tang and Bigby 1996; Thurman et al. 1995. Chapter 3 32 vides clinicians with some helpful questions to guide their discussions. Considerations for Chronic Relapsers A patient who recently relapsed after a period of extended abstinence may feel especially hopeless and vulnerable (an abstinence viola\u00ad tion effect). In this situation, clinicians can acknowledge progress that had been made prior to relapse and reassure the patient that the internal gains from past recovery work have not all been lost (despite the feeling at the moment that they have), perhaps reframing the severity of emotional pain as an indicator of how important recovery is to the patient. Strategies for Engaging and Retaining Patients in Detoxification It is essential to keep patients who enter detoxi\u00ad fication from \" falling through the cracks\" (Kertesz et al. 2003). Successful providers acknowledge and show respect for the patient's pain, needs, and joys, and validate the patient's fears, ambivalence, expectation of recovery, and positive life changes. It is essen\u00ad tial that all clinicians who have contact with patients in withdrawal continually offer hope and the expectation of recovery. An atmo\u00ad sphere that conveys comfort, relaxation, clean\u00ad liness, availability of medical attention, and security is beneficial to patients experiencing the discomforts of the withdrawal process. Throughout the detoxification experience, detoxification staff should be unified in their message that detoxification is only the begin\u00ad ning of the substance abuse treatment process and that rehabilitation and maintenance activi\u00ad ties are critical to sustained recovery. Educate the Patient on the Withdrawal Process During intoxication and withdrawal, it is useful to provide information on the typical with\u00ad drawal process based on the particular drug of abuse. Usually withdrawal includes symptoms that are the opposite of the effects of the partic\u00ad ular drug. This rebound effect can cause anxi\u00ad ety and concern for patients. Providing infor\u00ad mation about the common withdrawal symp\u00ad toms of the specific drugs of abuse may reduce discomfort and the likelihood that the individu\u00ad al will leave detoxification services prematurely (for a list of withdrawal symptoms, see chapter 4). Settings that routinely encounter individu\u00ad als in withdrawal should have written materials available on drug effects and withdrawal from specific drugs, and have staff who are well versed in the signs and symptoms of withdraw\u00ad al. An additional consideration is providing such information to non-English\u00adspeaking patients and their families. Interventions that assist the client in identify\u00ad ing and managing urges to use also may be helpful in retaining the client in detoxification and ensuring initiation of rehabilitation. These interventions may include cognitive- behavioral approaches that help the individu\u00adal identify thoughts or urges to use, the devel\u00adopment of an individualized plan to resist these urges, and use of medications such as naltrexone to reduce craving (Anton 1999; Miller and Gold 1994). Use Support Systems The use of client advocates to intervene with clients wishing to leave early often can be an effective strategy for promoting retention in detoxification. Visitors should be instructed about the importance of supporting the individ\u00ad ual in both detoxification and substance abuse treatment. If available, and if the patient is sta\u00ad ble, he or she can attend onsite 12\u00adStep or other support group meetings while receiving detoxification services. These activities rein\u00ad force the need for substance abuse treatment An Overview of Psychosocial and Biomedical Issues During Detoxification 33 and maintenance activities and may provide a critical recovery\u00adoriented support system once detoxification services are completed. Maintain a Drug\u00adFree Environment Maintaining a safe and drug\u00adfree environment is essential to retaining clients in detoxifica\u00adtion. Providers should be alert to drug\u00adseek\u00ading behaviors, including bringing alcohol or other drugs into the facility. Visiting areas should be easy for the staff to monitor closely, and staff may want to search visiting areas and other public areas periodically to reduce the opportunities for acquiring substances. It is important to note, however, that personnel should be respectful in their efforts to main\u00adtain a drug\u00adfree environment. It is important to explain to patients (prior to treatment) and visitors why substances are not allowed in the facility. Consider Alternative Approaches Alternative approaches such as acupuncture are safe, inexpensive, and increasingly popular in both detoxification and substance abuse treatment. Although the effectiveness of alter\u00ad native treatments in detoxification and treat\u00ad ment has not been validated in well\u00adcontrolled clinical trials, if an alternative therapy brings patients into detoxification and keeps them there, it may have utility beyond whatever spe\u00ad cific therapeutic value it may have (Trachtenberg 2000). Other treatments that reside outside the Western biomedical system, typically grouped together under the heading of Complementary or Alternative Medicine, also may be useful for retaining patients. Indeed, given the great cultural diversity in the United States, other culturally appropriate practices should be considered. Enhancing Motivation Motivational enhancements are particularly well\u00adsuited to accomplishing the detoxification services goal of promoting initiation in reha\u00adbilitation and maintenance activities. Use of these techniques in the detoxification setting increases the likelihood that patients will seek treatment by helping them understand the adverse consequences of continued substance use. It also establishes a supportive and non\u00adjudgmental relationship between the sub\u00adstance abuse counselor and the patient\u2014this therapeutic alliance is an important factor in the patient's choice to seek treatment services (Miller and Rollnick 2002). TIP 35, Enhancing Motivation for Change in Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT 1999c), covers specific interventions and techniques to increase motivation to change substance\u00adrelated behaviors. TIP 35 also includes some basic principles common to motivational interventions (CSAT 1999 c, p. xvii): Focus on the patient's strengths. Show respect for a patient's decisions and autonomy; respect should be maintained at all times, even when the patient is intoxicated. Avoid confrontation. Individualize treatment. Do not use labels that depersonalize the patient, such as \" addict\" or \"alcoholic.\" E mpathize with the patient, making an attempt to understand the patient's perspec\u00ad tive and accept his or her feelings. Accept treatment goals that involve small steps toward ultimate goals. Assist the patient in developing an awareness of discrepancies between her or his goals or values and current behavior. Listen reflectively to the patient's immediate concerns and ask open\u00adended questions. In addition, the detoxification team can lever\u00adage the relationship the patient has with sig\u00adnificant others. Using interventions such as Community Reinforcement and Family Training (CRAFT) (Miller et al. 1999), the detoxification team can help significant others in the patient's life capitalize on moments when the patient is ready for change and Chapter 3 34 assist the patient in preparing for change in a nonthreatening, nonconfrontational manner. The consensus panel does not recommend that clinicians use direct confrontation in helping a person with a substance use disor\u00adder begin the process of detoxification and subsequent substance abuse treatment. Techniques that involve purposefully con\u00adfronting patients about their substance use behavior, such as the Johnson Intervention, where significant others are taught to con\u00adfront the individuals using substances (Liepman 1993), have been shown to be high\u00adly effective when significant others implement them. However, subsequent studies of clini\u00adcians, groups, and programs that rely on con\u00adfrontational techniques have yielded poor outcomes (Miller et al. 1995). Moreover, the vast majority of significant others do not wish to use these techniques, and for that reason these techniques are not recommended (Miller et al. 1999). Care should be taken to ensure that any sig\u00adnificant other who is involved in motivating the patient for therapy is appropriate for this task. Only significant others who have been appropriately introduced to the intervention by a clinician should participate. The pres\u00adence of a trained facilitator is recommended, either for coaching or for facilitating the intervention. It also is important to have the recommended treatment option readily avail\u00adable so if the patient agrees, admission can be swift and seamless. Those individuals selected to intervene should support the patient's abstinence from substances of abuse. Furthermore, if the patient places consider\u00ad able value on her or his relationships with these significant others, success is more likely (Longabaugh et al. 1993). Tailoring Motivational Intervention to Stage of Change Perhaps the most well\u00adknown and empirically validated model of \"readiness to change\" that has been applied to substance abuse is the transtheoretical model, also known as the stages of change model (DiClemente and Prochaska 1998). The interventions to increase patient motivation for substance abuse treatment described in TIP 35, Enhancing Motivation for Change in Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT 1999c) are based on this model. According to the model, a client is considered to be at one of five stages of readiness to change his substance\u00adabus\u00ading behavior, each stage being progres\u00adsively closer to sus\u00adtained recovery. Those stages are pre\u00ad contemplation, con\u00ad templation, prepara\u00ad tion, action, and maintenance. The model assumes that individuals may move back and forth between different stages over time. A corollary to this assumption is that an Clinicians, groups, and programs that rely on confrontational techniques have yielded poor outcomes. individual's level of motivation is definitely not a permanent characteristic. Rather, moti\u00ad vation to change can be influenced by others, including detoxification treatment staff. In general, the basic concept is to try to move patients to the next stage of change. The clini\u00adcian needs to identify any potential obstacles that might hinder the patient's progress through the stages of change. The transtheo\u00adretical model is illustrated in Figure 3\u00ad5 (p. 36) and the details of each stage are described in the text below. An Overview of Psychosocial and Biomedical Issues During Detoxification 35 Figure 3\u00ad5 The Transtheoretical Model (Stages of Change) Source: DiClemente and Prochaska 1998. In the precontemplation stage, the individual is not considering any change in substance\u00ad using behavior in the foreseeable future. Typically, a patient in this stage either is unaware that his substance use is a problem or is unwilling or too discouraged to make a change. Often, a person in the precontempla\u00ad tion stage has not experienced serious conse\u00ad quences from substance use. During the pre\u00ad contemplation stage, the clinician should be attentive for and seize upon any ambivalence expressed by the patient toward substance\u00ad related behaviors. Such ambivalence may be more likely to emerge during initial detoxifi\u00adcation, before the patient has returned to a relative zone of comfort and greater denial. For patients who are determined to remain in the precontemplation stage, the main goal is to get the patient to begin to consider chang\u00ading. To accomplish this, the clinician might express concern, listen to the patient's per\u00ad Chapter 3 36 spective, and keep the door open for further communication regarding treatment options. In the contemplation stage, the individual has some awareness that substance use presents a problem. In this stage, the patient may express a desire or willingness to change, but has no definite plans to do so in the near future, which generally is considered to be the next 2 to 6 months. Whether it is explicit\u00adly stated or not, it is thought that most indi\u00adviduals in this stage are ambivalent about changing. That is, side\u00adby\u00adside with any desire to change is a desire to continue the current behavior. For patients in the contem\u00adplation stage, clinicians are advised to use \"decisional balancing strategies\" to help the patient move to the action stage (Carey et al. 1999). In this approach, the clinician helps the patient to consider the positive and nega\u00adtive aspects of her substance abuse and has the patient weigh them against each other with the expectation that the scale of balance tips in favor of adopting new behavior. Psychoeducation on the interaction of sub\u00adstance abuse with other problems, including health, legal, employment, parenting, and mental illness, can be part of this procedure. Helping the patient understand that ambiva\u00adlent feelings about changing substance use behaviors are normal and expected can be particularly useful at this stage. In the preparation stage, the patient is aware that his substance use presents a significant problem and desires change. Moreover, the patient has made a conscious decision to com\u00ad mit himself to a behavior change. This stage is defined as one in which the individual pre\u00ad pares for the upcoming change in specific ways, such as deciding whether a formal treatment program is needed and, if so, which one. This stage is characterized by goal set\u00ad ting and making commitments to stop using, such as informing coworkers, friends, and family of treatment plans. For patients in the preparation stage, clinicians should elicit the patient's goals and strategies for change and be on the alert for signs that the patient is ready to move into the action stage. It is criti\u00adcal that the clinician respond quickly to any requests for treatment to capitalize on this motivation before it wanes. One of the most critically important roles the clinician can play in this stage is to assist the patient in developing a plan of action or a behavioral contract, taking into account the individual needs of the patient. As part of this process the clinician should help the patient enlist social support. Exploring the patient's expec\u00adtations regarding treatment and her role in it is important. Finally, because of the common\u00adly experienced difficulty in accessing treat\u00adment, the clinician should discuss with the patient ways of maintaining motivation for change during a possible wait for entry into a treatment program, should the patient be placed, for example, on a waiting list. In the action stage, the patient is taking active steps to change substance use behav\u00ad iors. This includes making modifications to his habits and environment, such as not spending time in places or with people associ\u00adated with drug taking behavior. These changes may even continue to be made 3 to 6 months after substance abuse has ceased. In the maintenance stage, the patient is work\u00ad ing to maintain the changes initiated in the action phase. Fostering a Therapeutic Alliance The therapeutic alliance refers to the quality of the relationship between a patient and his care providers and is the \" nonspecific factor\" that predicts successful therapy outcomes across a variety of different therapies (Horvath and Luborsky 1993). A therapeutic alliance should be developed in the context of an ability to form an alliance to a group of helping individu\u00ad als\u2014such as a healthy support network or therapeutic community. A clinically appropri\u00ad ate relationship between the clinician and patient that is supportive, empathic, and non\u00ad judgmental is the hallmark of a strong thera\u00ad peutic alliance. An Overview of Psychosocial and Biomedical Issues During Detoxification 37 Readiness to change predicts a positive thera\u00ad peutic alliance (Connors et al. 2000). Strong alliances, in turn, have been associated with positive outcomes in patients who are depen\u00addent on alcohol (Connors et al. 1997), as well as patients involved in methadone mainte\u00adnance, on such measures as illicit drug use, employment status, and psychological func\u00adtioning. In addition, the practitioner's exper\u00adtise and competence instill confidence in the treatment and strengthen the therapeutic alliance. Emphasis also should be given to the alliance with a social support network, which can be a powerful predictor of whether the patient stays in treatment (Luborsky 2000). Given the importance of the therapeutic alliance and the fact that detoxification often is the entry point for patients into substance abuse treatment services, work on establish\u00ading a therapeutic alliance ideally will begin upon admission. Many of the guidelines listed above for enhancing motivation apply to establishing this rapport. Newman (1997) makes some additional recommendations for developing the therapeutic alliance, such as discussing the issue of confidentiality with patients and acknowledging that the road to recovery is difficult. He also advises being consistent, dependable, trustworthy, and available, even when the patient is not. The clinician should remain calm and cool even if the patient becomes noticeably upset. Practitioners should be confident yet humble and should set limits in a respectful manner without engaging in a power struggle. See Figure 3\u00ad6 for a list of characteristics most valuable to a clinician in strengthening the therapeutic alliance. Referrals and Linkages Once an individual passes through the most severe of the withdrawal symptoms and is safe and medically stable, the focus of the psychoso\u00ad cial interventions shifts toward actively prepar\u00ad ing her for substance abuse treatment and maintenance activities. These interventions include (1) assessment of the patient's charac\u00ad teristics, strengths, and vulnerabilities that will influence recommendations for substance abuse treatment; (2) preparing the patient to participate in treatment; and (3) successfully linking the patient to treatment as well as other needed services and resources. Figure 3\u00ad6 Clinician's Characteristics Most Important to the Therapeutic Alliance Is supportive, empathic, and nonjudgmental Knows which patients can be engaged and which should be referred to another treatment provider Can establish rapport with any client Remembers to discuss confidentiality issues Acknowledges challenges on the road to recovery Is consistent, trustworthy, and reliable Remains calm and cool even when a client is upset Is confident but humble Sets limits without engaging in a power struggle Recognizes the client's progress toward a goal Encourages self\u00adexpression on the part of the client Chapter 3 38 Ensuring that patients with substance use dis\u00ad orders enter substance abuse treatment fol\u00adlowing detoxification often is difficult. Many patients believe that once they have eliminat\u00aded the substance or substances of abuse from their bodies, they have achieved abstinence. Moreover, some insurance policies may not cover treatment, or only offer partial cover\u00adage. The patient may have to go through cum\u00adbersome channels to determine if treatment is covered, and if so, how much. Preparation should focus on eliminating administrative barriers to entering substance abuse treatment prior to discussing treatment options with the patient. Discussions with the patient should be consistent with the patient's improving ability to process and assess infor\u00admation in such a way that the patient appears to be acting with his or her own interests in mind. Evaluation of the Patient's Rehabilitation Needs To make appropriate recommendations for ongoing treatment and recovery activities, detoxification staff need to determine the individual characteristics of clients and their environments that are likely to influence the level of care, setting, and specialized services needed for recovery. ASAM's Patient Placement Criteria, Second Edition, Revised (PPC\u00ad2R) (ASAM 2001) provides one widely used model for determining the level of ser\u00ad vices needed to address substance\u00adrelated dis\u00ad orders. The levels of treatment services range from community\u00adbased early intervention groups to medically managed intensive inpa\u00ad tient services. As noted in chapter 2, providers need to make a placement decision based on six dimensions: 1. Acute Intoxication and/or Withdrawal Potential 2. Biomedical Conditions and Complications 3. Emotional, Behavioral, or Cognitive Conditions or Complications 4. Readiness to Change 5. Relapse, Continued Use, or Continued Problem Potential 6. Recovery/Living Environment Due to the limited time patients stay in detoxifi\u00ad cation settings, it is challenging for programs to conduct a complete assessment of the rehabili\u00ad tation needs of the individual. With this in mind, detoxification programs should focus on those areas that are essential to make an appropriate linkage to substance abuse treat\u00ad ment services. The assessment of the psychoso\u00ad cial needs affecting the rehabilitation process itself may have to be left to the professionals providing substance abuse treatment. Other assessment considerations include Special needs, such as co\u00adoccurring psychi\u00ad atric and medical conditions that may com\u00ad plicate treatment or limit access to available rehabilitation services Pregnancy, physical limitations, and cogni\u00ad tive impairments that limit the settings suit\u00ad able for the individual Support system issues such as family sup\u00ad port, domestic violence, and isolation that influence recommendations about residen\u00adtial versus outpatient settings The needs of dependent children The need for gender\u00adspecific treatment (for more information see the forthcoming TIPs Substance Abuse Treatment: Addressing the Specific Needs of Women [SAMHSA in development e] and Substance Abuse Treatment: Men's Issues [SAMHSA in development g]). Figure 3\u00ad7 (p. 40) outlines the areas the consen\u00ad sus panel recommends for assessment to deter\u00ad mine the most appropriate rehabilitation plan. Appendix C lists a variety of instruments use\u00adful in characterizing the addiction and related disorders (for example, the Addiction Severity Index [ASI]), measuring motivation\u00adal willingness to change (Stages of Change Readiness and Treatment Eagerness Scale [SOCRATES] and University of Rhode Island Change Assessment [URICA]), and evaluating co\u00adoccurring psychiatric conditions and social An Overview of Psychosocial and Biomedical Issues During Detoxification 39 Figure 3\u00ad7 Recommended Areas for Assessment To Determine Appropriate Rehabilitation Plans Domain Description Medical Conditions and Complications Infectious illnesses, chronic illnesses requiring intensive or specialized treat\u00ad ment, pregnancy, and chronic pain Motivation/Readiness to Change Degree to which the client acknowledges that substance use behaviors are a problem and is willing to confront them honestly Physical, Sensory, or Mobility Limitations Physical conditions that may require specially designed facilities or staffing Relapse History and Potential Historical relapse patterns, periods of abstinence, and predictors of absti\u00ad nence; client awareness of relapse triggers and craving Substance Abuse/Dependence Frequency, amount, and duration of use; chronicity of problems; indicators of abuse or dependence Developmental and Cognitive Issues Ability to participate in confrontational treatment settings, and benefit from cognitive interventions and group therapy Family and Social Support Degree of support from family and significant others, substance\u00adfree friends, involvement in support groups Co\u00adOccurring Psychiatric Disorders Other psychiatric symptoms that are likely to complicate the treatment of the substance use disorder and require treatment themselves, concerns about safety in certain settings (note that assessment for co\u00adoccurring disorders should include a determination of any psychiatric medications that the patient may be taking for the condition) Dependent Children Custody of dependent children or caring for noncustodial children and options for care of these children during rehabilitation Trauma and Violence Current domestic violence that affects the safety of the living environment, co\u00ad occurring posttraumatic stress disorder or trauma history that might compli\u00ad cate rehabilitation Treatment History Prior successful and unsuccessful rehabilitation experiences that might influ\u00ad ence decision about type of setting indicated Cultural Background Cultural identity, issues, and strengths that might influence the decision to seek culturally specific rehabilitation programs, culturally driven strengths or obstacles that might dictate level of care or setting Strengths and Resources Unique strengths and resources of the client and his or her environment Language Language or speech issues that make it difficult to communicate or require an interpreter familiar with substance abuse Chapter 3 40 and family factors. Administering these instruments requires varying degrees of sophistication on the part of the clinician. All instruments should be considered for their cultural, linguistic, level of cognitive compre\u00adhension, and developmental appropriateness for each patient. For further information on patient placement see TIP 13, The Role and Current Status of Patient Placement Criteria in the Treatment of Substance Use Disorders (CSAT 1995h). Settings for Treatment Just as with settings for detoxification, set\u00adtings where substance abuse treatment is pro\u00advided often are confused with the level of intensity of the services. It is increasingly clear that although level of intensity of ser\u00advices and setting are both critical to success\u00adful recovery, they are two separate dimen\u00adsions to be considered when linking clients to treatment. This process has been called \"de\u00ad linking\" or \"unbundling\" and generally involves determining the need for social ser\u00advices independently from the clinical intensity (Gastfriend and McLellan 1997; McGee and Mee\u00adLee 1997). Treatment and maintenance activities are offered in a variety of settings. These include settings specifically designed to deliver sub\u00adstance abuse treatment, such as freestanding substance abuse treatment centers, as well as settings operating for other purposes, includ\u00ading mental health centers, jails and prisons, and community corrections facilities. Descriptions of these settings appear below: Inpatient programs for treatment of sub\u00ad stance abuse generally are delivered in hos\u00ad pitals and freestanding clinics and provide 24\u00adhour nursing care in addition to inten\u00adsive treatment for substance\u00adrelated prob\u00ad lems. Residential treatment programs normally provide 24\u00adhour supervision by nonmedical staff and the availability of medical staff may be limited. These programs deliver highly intensive substance abuse counseling and clients may participate in the upkeep of facilities. Peer support is critical to the treatment delivered. As a general rule, patients will stay at a residential treatment facility for 7 to 30 days. Therapeutic communities (TCs) usually have 24\u00adhour supervision by nonmedical staff or clients who have sustained recov\u00adery. They tend to provide highly intensive counseling services and rely on peer sup\u00adport and confrontation to shape behaviors of clients. The TC is based on concepts of self\u00adhelp. Residence in a TC is longer than a patient's stay in a residential program\u2014 patients usually stay for a period of at least 30 days and often 6 months to a year. In some special situations, such as a criminal justice setting, TC residence can last 2 years or more. Transitional residential programs and halfway houses ordinarily have 24\u00adhour supervision from nonmedical staff or clients who have sustained recovery. Patients in these programs often are working and par\u00adticipate in counseling and peer support dur\u00ading the evening and weekend hours. Partial hospitalization and day treatment programs use a combination of medical and nonmedical staff to deliver a high intensity of counseling services during daytime hours. Patients return home in the evenings. Intensive outpatient programs usually are delivered by nonmedical staff in a clinic location. Patients receive 6 to 9 hours of counseling services each week in two or three contacts. Traditional outpatient services typically are delivered by counselors in a clinic or office setting and provide fewer hours of services than the \"intensive outpatient\" programs. Recovery maintenance activities are not treatment but are highly valuable for ongo\u00ading sobriety maintenance. They include 12\u00adStep and other support groups aimed at maintaining the gains accomplished in treat\u00ad An Overview of Psychosocial and Biomedical Issues During Detoxification 41 ment settings . Oxford House establishments and other \"clean and sober\" living environ\u00ad ments are among the resources that clini\u00ad cians should explore and perhaps incorpo\u00ad rate in maintenance activities. Provide Linkage to Treatment and Maintenance Activities Approximately half of those making an appointment for treatment do not appear for their first appointment and another 20 per\u00adcent or more fail to appear for the second appointment (Gottheil et al. 1997; Parker 2002). As patients near completion of detoxi\u00adfication, whether they take the next step and enter treatment is dependent on a number of variables. Patients who are employed, are motivated beyond the precontemplation stage, and have family and social support, as well as those with co\u00adoccurring psychiatric condi\u00adtions, are more likely to initiate treatment. Conversely, those who have severe drug dependence and those who are older are less likely to follow through and enter treatment (Kirchner et al. 2000; Weisner et al. 2001). Women are more likely to initiate treatment after detoxification than men, and individuals who have health insurance that features a behavioral health carve\u00adout and lower cost\u00adsharing requirements are more likely to enter treatment than those who do not (Mark et al. 2003 b). Kleinman and associates (2002) fol\u00ad lowed 279 opioid\u00ad and cocaine\u00addependent patients who had been in detoxification pro\u00adgrams to determine how many had entered substance abuse treatment 30 days after leav\u00ading the detoxification program. They found that those who were on parole, homeless, or who had been using drugs for less than 20 years were more likely than others to have entered treatment. Research indicates that patients are more likely to initiate and remain in rehabilitation if they believe the services will help them with specific life problems (Fiorentine et al. 1999). Figure 3\u00ad8 suggests strategies that detoxifica\u00adtion personnel can use with their patients to promote the initiation of treatment and main\u00adtenance activities. Provide Access to Wraparound Services Patients are more likely to engage in treatment if they believe the full array of their problems Figure 3\u00ad8 Strategies To Promote Initiation of Treatment and Maintenance Activities Perform assessment of urgency for treatment. Reduce time between initial call and appointment. Call to reschedule missed appointments. Provide information about what to expect at the first session. Provide information about confidentiality. Offer tangible incentives. Engage the support of family members. Introduce the client to the counselor who will deliver rehabilitation services. Offer services that address basic needs, such as housing, employment, and childcare. Source: Carroll 1997; Fehr et al. 1991. Chapter 3 42 will be addressed, including those needs typi\u00ad cally addressed by wraparound services (e.g., housing, vocational assistance, childcare, transportation) (Fiorentine et al. 1999). Moreover, patients receiving needed wraparound services remain in substance abuse treatment longer and improve more than people who do not receive such services (Hser et al. 1999). As the individual passes through acute intoxi\u00ad cation and withdrawal, it is important to ensure that the basic needs of the patient are met after discharge. These needs include access to a safe, stable, and drug\u00adfree living environment if possible; physical safety; food and clothing; ongoing health and prenatal care; financial assistance; and childcare. Ensuring access to these basic needs may be problematic, and staff must be flexible and creative in finding the means to meet the basic needs of the patient. Clearly, services planning should extend beyond the issues of substance dependence to other areas that may affect compliance with rehabilitation. Detoxification providers should be familiar with available resources for legal assistance, dental care, support groups, interpreters, housing assistance, trauma treatment, recovery\u00adsensitive parent\u00ading groups, spiritual and cultural support, employment assistance, and other assistance programs for basic needs. Family and other support systems also can be helpful to the patient in accessing services and should take part in the services planning as often as possi\u00ad ble, always with the patient's consent. To address the needs of homeless and indigent patients, detoxification providers should be familiar with emergency shelters, cash assis\u00ad tance, and food programs in their communi\u00adties and should have established referral rela\u00ad tionships. Assessing women, teenagers, older adults, and other vulnerable individuals for victimization by another member of the household also is important. Patients should be linked with prenatal and primary health care for domestic violence. Ideally, linkage to these programs includes more than a phone number; detoxification staff should assist patients in scheduling initial appointments and arranging for transportation. Linkage to primary health and prenatal care as well as to community resources is essential for individuals with substance use disorders. Linkages can be an effective mechanism to assist the patient in accessing these services if they are not available as a part of the detoxi\u00adfication program. Formalized referral arrangements through contracts or memoran\u00adda of understanding can be useful to specify organizational obligations (D'Aunno 1997). Minimize Access Barriers An integral part of the process of linking an individual with rehabilitation and treatment resources is to address access barriers. Transportation, child care during treatment, the potential for relapse between detoxification discharge and treatment admission, housing needs, and safety issues such as possible domestic violence should be addressed through an individualized plan prior to discharge. The problem of a patient's placement on a waiting list presents a special barrier to treat\u00adment. The solution lies in developing strate\u00adgies to maintain motivation for treatment dur\u00ading the waiting period. For pregnant women and patients with depen\u00ad dent children, the threat of Child Protective Services removing their children for abuse and neglect due to drug use can be a barrier to entering a treatment program. Additionally, interacting with hostile or unfriendly practitioners and encountering resistance from family, partners, or friends can be barriers to treatment entry. Detoxification staff should be knowledgeable about State laws regarding drug use during pregnancy and definitions of child abuse and neglect in order to be able to reassure and encourage women to enter treatment. An Overview of Psychosocial and Biomedical Issues During Detoxification 43 People who identify as having a physical or cognitive disability also face special barriers to treatment. The reader is referred to TIP 29, Substance Use Disorder Treatment for People With Physical and Cognitive Disabilities (CSAT 1998g) and TIP 36, Substance Abuse Treatment for Persons With Child Abuse and Neglect Issues (CSAT 2000d), for more information on these topics. For racial/ethnic minorities, access barriers can be compounded by language, cultural, and financial factors. The ability of programs to develop culturally specific interventions, train staff and interpreters to respond to the specific needs of these individuals, and be aware of cultural differences in the manifesta\u00adtion of symptoms is critical to improving access to care. Supervision of staff and train\u00ading in cross\u00adcultural issues is equally impor\u00adtant to all programs serving diverse patient populations. The forthcoming TIP Improving Cultural Competence in Substance Abuse Treatment (SAMHSA in development a) con\u00ad tains more information on this topic. Use Case Management Case management presents an opportunity to tailor services to individual client needs and to minimize barriers to these services (Gastfriend and McLellan 1997). Case man\u00adagement is a set of services managed to assist the client in accessing needed resources. It is a useful strategy to ensure that access to wraparound services such as employment, housing, health care, and basic needs are met along with minimizing barriers to accessing substance abuse treatment. As outlined in TIP 27, Comprehensive Case Management for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT 1998a), the common functions of case management are defined as assessment, planning, linkage, monitoring, and advocacy. Case managers can facilitate the critical linkage between detoxification services and rehabilitation by providing transportation to the rehabilitation facility, arranging for childcare, or assisting with housing needs. Additionally, case man\u00ad agement is a widely used strategy to integrate mental health and substance abuse treatment for those with co\u00adoccurring conditions (Drake and Mueser 2000). Linkage to Ongoing Psychiatric Services Although it is important to make referrals for ongoing psychiatric attention, the presence of psychological symptoms should not prevent detoxification staff from referring patients to substance abuse treatment. Individuals with co\u00adoccurring psychiatric conditions appear to be able to initiate and benefit from substance abuse treatment like individuals without psy\u00ad chiatric conditions (Joe et al. 1995). Since some psychiatric illnesses may affect drug cravings in patients who are substance dependent, it is important to ensure that both the psychiatric condition and the substance use disorder are addressed in rehabilitation (Anton 1999). Individuals who are taking psy\u00adchotropic medications should be counseled about the importance of continuing on these medications. Whenever possible, discharge from the detoxification services should be coordinated with the patient's mental health provider in the community, and the patient should have an appointment scheduled at the time of discharge from the detoxification facility. Detoxification providers should request that the patient sign appropriate releases of information to provide assessment and other material to the mental health provider to promote continuity of care. This should only occur when the patient is medi\u00adcally stabilized and is in such a state of mind that he or she can make coherent decisions in this regard (e.g., while intoxicated, patients should not be permitted to sign releases). For individuals with serious co\u00adoccurring psy\u00ad chiatric conditions, integrated treatment for substance use disorders and mental illness is recommended. Case management services as described above may be especially important for individuals with severe mental illness impeding their ability to access services on their own. Increasingly, substance abuse and Chapter 3 44 mental health providers are implementing models using clinicians trained to deliver both substance abuse and mental health treatment concurrently (Drake and Mueser 2000). For more information, see TIP 42, Substance Abuse Treatment for Persons With Co\u00ad Occurring Disorders (CSAT 2005c). Linkage to Followup Medical Care The patient's consent should be sought to involve her or his primary healthcare provider in the coordination of care. Patients with chronic medical conditions and those in need of followup care should have an appointment made for followup medical care before leaving the detoxification setting (Luborsky et al. 1997). Considerations for Individuals With Chronic Substance Dependence For individuals with substance abuse prob\u00adlems who detoxify regularly but have limited periods of abstinence, traditional treatment approaches may not be effective. In some cases, addressing other needs may provide an avenue to engage the individual with chronic substance dependence in treatment. Case management approaches can be successful at addressing the need for housing, health care, and basic needs even though the individual is not yet willing to confront the issue of drink\u00ading or other drug use (Cox et al. 1998). TIP 27, Comprehensive Case Management for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT 1998a), provides additional information about deliv\u00adery of case management services to homeless individuals with substance use disorders and those with other complex problems. Documentation of repetitive inappropriate use of voluntary detoxification services may help pave the way for civil commitment to involuntary treatment where this is an option, and, where detoxification resources are limit\u00aded, treatment systems need to be creative in designing care plans for patients seeking fre\u00adquent detoxification without evidence of any therapeutic benefit.

Psychosocial and Biomedical Screening and Assessment Alcohol Intoxication and Withdrawal Benzodiazepines and Other Sedative\u00ad Steroids Club Drugs Management of Polydrug Abuse: An Integrated Approach Alternative Approaches Considerations for Specific Populations 4 Physical Detoxification Services for Withdrawal Fr om Specific Substances This chapter highlights specific treatment regimens for specific sub\u00ad stances and provides guidance on the medical, nursing, and social ser\u00ad vices aspects of these treatments. It also includes considerations for spe\u00ad cific populations. Although it is written principally for healthcare profes\u00ad sionals, some professionals without medical training may find it of use. To accommodate a broad audience, the chapter includes definitions for technical terms that may be unfamiliar to some readers\u2014for example, \" the patient was afebrile (without fever).\" Psychosocial and Biomedical Screening and Assessment This section covers more complex psychosocial and biomedical assess\u00ad ments that may occur after initial contact as an individual undergoes detoxification. Psychosocial and biomedical screening and services are closely associated: neither is likely to succeed without the other, as the case study below illustrates. Although the medical issues in this case indicate that the patient could successfully be managed as an outpatient, careful assessment of psy\u00ad chosocial and biomedical aspects of the patient's condition, including lack of transportation, the risk of violence, and his inability to carry out routine medical instructions, strongly indicated that the patient remain in a 24\u00adhour supervised setting such as a residential detoxification or treatment program. For an illustration of some of the fundamental 47 Case Study A 44\u00adyear\u00adold Caucasian male with a fifth\u00adgrade education presented to an emergency clinic in mild alcohol withdrawal with no alcohol for 9 hours. The patient was mildly tremulous with some nausea and insomnia; blood pressure was 142/94; pulse was 96. The patient was afebrile [i.e., without fever], and Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol (CIWA\u00adAr) (see below) score = 12, indicating mild withdrawal. A treatment plan was recommended that called for an outpatient 3\u00adday fixed\u00addose taper of lorazepam (a benzodiazepine medication) plus multivitamins and oral thiamine. The patient was instructed to return daily for brief assessment by nursing personnel. The social worker assigned to this client pointed out that there was no reliable transportation to the clinic, there had been domestic violence on the parts of both spouses, and the patient's ability to carry out routine medical instructions was questionable. aspects of the patient's health and psychosocial status that should be covered in screening and assessment, see Figure 3\u00ad1, p. 25. Figure 4\u00ad1 lists several instruments useful in characterizing the intensity of specific with\u00ad drawal states (see appendix C for more infor\u00ad mation on these instruments and how to obtain them). Biochemical Markers and Their Use This section focuses on biochemical laborato\u00adry tests that detect the presence or absence of alcohol or another substance of abuse, may be able to quantify the level of present use, or may be able to quantify cumulative use over the past few weeks. Tests in all of these areas are reasonably well developed and validated for alcohol. This is not the case for most other substances of abuse. Biochemical mark\u00ad ers are not adequate screening or assessment instruments alone, but rather are used to support a more comprehensive clinical assess\u00ad ment. Common uses of these biochemical markers are: 1. In the initial screening setting to support or refute other information that leads to proper diagnosis, assessment, and manage\u00ad ment. 2. For forensic purposes (e.g., evaluating a driver after an automobile accident). 3. In detecting occult (secretive or hidden) use of alcohol and other substances in therapeutic settings where abstinence, rehabilitation, and treatment are being promoted. Clinicians also can use the presentation of information from biochemical markers to patients as an effective tool in motivational enhancement. For example, information regarding liver transaminases (specific kinds of enzymes that perform chemical reactions within the liver) helps provide the patient with objective information on the level of recent alcohol use and potential acute hepatic damage. This may help the patient move from contemplating treatment to actually beginning treatment. For a more detailed discussion of biological markers in substance abuse, see Javors and colleagues (1997). Blood alcohol content Blood alcohol content (BAC) can be determined by highly sensitive laboratory procedures that generally are available in most emergency departments, hospitals, and clinical chemistry laboratories. Alcohol elimination undergoes, for the most part, zero\u00adorder kinetics (decreas\u00ad ing a set amount per unit of time rather than a set percentage), so the concept of half\u00adlife is not really accurate. However, first\u00adorder kinetics and half\u00adlife do occur when BAC is low (i.e., below 10mg percent), and the half\u00adlife is on the order of about 15 minutes at that point. Though disappearance rates of 15mg percent per hour are probably average for moderate drinkers, higher values were seen in a group of Swedish drivers apprehended for driving while intoxicated (19mg/dL/hr) (Jones and Andersson Chapter 4 48 Figure 4\u00ad1 Assessment Instruments for Dependence and Withdrawal From Alcohol and Specific Illicit Drugs Drug of Dependence Instrument Reference Notes Alcohol CIWA\u00adAr Sullivan et al. 1989 10 items that take 2 to 5 minutes to com\u00adplete; scores 0-67, with 10 or greater as clinically significant; requires training to administer Cocaine Cocaine Selective Severity Assessment (CSSA) Kampman et al. 1998 18 items that take 10 minutes to com\u00adplete; high scores correlated with poor outcome Opioids Subjective Opiate Withdrawal Scale (SOWS) Handelsman et al. 1987 16\u00aditem questionnaire; using a scale of 0-4, respondents rate to what extent they are currently experiencing each of 16 characteristics; higher scores indicate more severe withdrawal Objective Opiate Withdrawal Scale (OOWS) Handelsman et al. 1987 Rater observes patient for about 10 min\u00adutes and indicates if any of 13 manifesta\u00adtions of withdrawal are present; scores can range from 0 to 13, with higher scores indicating more severe withdraw\u00adal; staff must be familiar with withdraw\u00adal signs 1996). The rate of metabolism of alcohol increases with dependence\u2014some alcoholics can metabolize 20-25mg/dL/hr (Jones and Andersson 1996), and Jones and Sternebring (1992) have found that alcohol\u00addependent patients may metabolize 22mg/dL/hr during detoxification. When knowledge of BAC is combined with clinical information, the healthcare provider can make some predictions regarding the acuteness of withdrawal. For example, in an individual whose blood alcohol level is 200mg percent but who is already showing tremu\u00ad lousness (shakiness of the hands), brisk reflexes, tachycardia (rapid heart rate), diaphoresis (excessive sweating), and perhaps a CIWA\u00adAr score in the moderate or high range (about 15 or higher), the clinician can reasonably predict that the withdrawal will be relatively severe. As noted, however, the rate of metabolism of alcohol increases with dependence. The diagnosis of alcohol intoxi\u00adcation is a clinical diagnosis and not based simply on a BAC. A person with a BAC of 200mg percent could be in withdrawal, intoxi\u00adcated (showing related signs and symptoms), or showing no signs and symptoms of either intoxication or withdrawal. A BAC above 100mg percent does not necessarily indicate clinical intoxication. Like all laboratory pro\u00adcedures, the blood alcohol levels test has limi\u00adtations. Usually, patient permission must be obtained prior to testing, the testing itself can be expensive, and forensic testing may be subject to specific legal procedures. Physical Detoxification Services for Withdrawal From Specific Substances 49 Reading Blood Alcohol Concentrations Blood alcohol concentrations are measured in milligrams (mg) of alcohol per deciliter (dL) of blood. This figure is converted to a percentage. One hundred mg/dL equals 100mg percent or 0.1 percent. Thus, a BAC of .1mg percent is equivalent to a concentration of 100mg of alcohol per deciliter of blood. Source: Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT) 1995a. Breath alcohol levels Although the initial cost of small breath alcohol instruments may be relatively high, the recur\u00ad ring costs (of disposable mouthpieces and peri\u00ad odic recalibration) are low. The technique is less invasive than blood testing and health providers can follow breath alcohol levels repeatedly at low expense during the course of assessment and detoxification. The detection of rapidly rising, high levels of alcohol over a short period of time may indicate alcohol poi\u00ad soning overdose. Breath alcohol levels provide useful guidance in determining whether to hos\u00ad pitalize these patients. Limitations on breath alcohol determinations are that patient cooperation is required and that some patients with lung diseases are not able to muster a sufficient tidal volume (force\u00ad ful breath) to give an accurate reading to the machine. On occasion, patients whose breath alcohol levels indicate recent alcohol use will assert that they have recently gargled with mouthwash that contained alcohol. Having the patient rinse his mouth with water several times and then making another breath alcohol determination in 15 to 30 minutes usually will resolve whether the patient's assertion is valid. Urine drug screens Urine drug screens vary widely in their meth\u00ad ods of detection, sensitivity and specificity, expense, and availability. The healthcare provider assessing patients for detoxification should be familiar with the type of assay (test measurement) being used; some examples are enzyme multiple assay techniques, thin layer chromatography, high performance liquid chromatography, urine alcohol concentration, and gas chromatography\u00admass spectrometry. Informed clinicians also should be aware of which drugs are screened for by the laboratory they use, the relative time window of detection (a substance's metabolic half\u00adlife, or approxi\u00ad mately how long a drug can be detected once ingested), and whether cross\u00adreactivity with other interfering substances may alter out\u00ad comes. Many laboratories perform more specif\u00ad ic confirmation testing on positive screening tests, which can largely eliminate false\u00adposi\u00ad tives. It is important to clarify which type of test result is being reported. Interfering and cross\u00adreactive substances leading to false\u00adposi\u00ad tive tests frequently are discussed in bulletins and publications periodically published by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Usually, the senior laboratory supervi\u00ad sor has up\u00adto\u00addate information in this area and often can be consulted via e\u00admail or telephone in an emergency. Limitations of urine drug screening include consent and privacy issues, expense, the inability to screen for some drugs of abuse, and the inability of urine drug screens to provide information on the current level of intoxication. Urine testing should at a minimum test for the presence of Benzodiazepines Barbiturates Cocaine Amphetamines Opioids PCP Chapter 4 50 It also should be noted that current testing for opioids primarily refers to \" organic\" drugs that are derived from opium (i.e., heroin, codeine, and morphine). Synthetic opioids like hydrocodone and methadone are not detected by the usual tests; this is true of oxycodone as well. If the use of these drugs is suspected, spe\u00ad cial tests can be ordered. Most important, each program should tailor its urine screening tests to reflect the substance use patterns prevalent in the community. Gamma\u00adglutamyltransferase (GGT) GGT has been measured in serum (the portion of the blood that has neither red nor white blood cells) for many years as a marker for liver damage. More recently, GGT has been advocated as a measure of cumulative alcohol use (Dackis 2001). Sensitivity of the test is in the 60 to 70 percent range and specificity (its ability not to misidentify or confuse alcohol use with other disorders) is in the 40 to 50 percent range. In general, both sensitivity and specifici\u00ad ty are lower in females than males. GGT does correlate with alcohol intake but often requires heavy drinking (more than six drinks per day) to elevate it, and only about half of individuals will show elevations. The half\u00adlife of elevated serum GGT after the onset of abstinence is said to be 2 to 3 weeks with alcoholic liver disease. Chlorpromazine, phenobarbital, and acetaminophen can all raise serum GGT levels. GGT is limited by its expense and its relative\u00ad ly low specificity, which sometimes leads to false\u00adpositive evaluations. GGT is helpful as a motivational enhancer in patients with a high degree of denial during detoxification. Evidence of liver damage, as measured by the GGT, provides patients with objective feed\u00adback concerning the consequences of their alcohol use and thus plays a very important role in enhancing motivation. Hepatitis is a general term that refers to inflammation of the liver with damage to liver cells (hepatocytes). Hepatitis may be due to viruses (such as in hepatitis A, B, C) or insults to the liver from toxins (such as chemi\u00adcals, alcohol, prescribed or over\u00adthe\u00adcounter medications). In any form of hepatitis, GGT may be elevated, indicating damage to liver cells. Therefore, GGT elevation does not automatically mean liver damage from alcohol use, although this is certainly one of the most common reasons for elevated GGT levels in patients hospitalized in North America. The use of GGT levels along with carbohydrate\u00addeficient transferrin (CDT) levels is a rela\u00adtively sensitive and specific indicator of alco\u00adhol use. The CDT test is discussed below. Carbohydrate\u00addeficient transferrin CDT has been developed over the past 20 years as a marker of cumulative alcohol consumption but is just now becoming widely available as a clinical tool. Sensitivities appear to be in the 70 to 80 percent range, and specificities of greater than 90 percent have been found. Sensitivity and specificity are somewhat lower among females than males. Most therapeutic drugs or drugs of abuse do not appear to affect CDT levels. When CDT and GGT levels are com\u00ad bined, sensitivity and specificity rise to more than 90 percent (Anton 2001). CDT testing is limited by its relatively high cost, lack of clini\u00ad cal availability in some laboratories, and false\u00ad positive results in abstaining individuals who have endstage liver disease from causes other than alcohol use (DiMartini et al. 2001). Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) Erythrocyte (red blood cell) size is measured in a Coulter counter and often is part of a com\u00ad plete blood count; therefore, it is widely avail\u00ad able to clinicians. Sensitivity and specificity are in the 30 to 50 percent range. Hence, caution should be exercised when interpreting an ele\u00ad vated MCV in relation to drinking behavior. This lab test should be considered complemen\u00ad tary to other biological markers that are more specific and sensitive, such as GGT or CDT. Advanced age, nutritional status, cigarette Physical Detoxification Services for Withdrawal From Specific Substances 51 smoking, and co\u00adoccurring disease states with\u00ad out the presence of alcoholism may make test results abnormal. Alcohol Intoxication and Withdrawal Intoxication Signs and Symptoms The clinical presentation of intoxication from alcohol varies widely depending in part on blood alcohol level and level of previously developed tolerance. At alcohol concentrations between 20mg percent and 80mg percent, loss of muscular coordination, changes in mood, personality alteration, and [increases in motor activity] begin. At levels from 80 to 200mg per\u00ad cent, more progressive neurologic impairment occurs with ataxia (inability to coordinate mus\u00ad cular activity) and slurring of speech being prominent. A variety of cognitive functions also are impaired. At blood alcohol levels between 200 and 300mg percent nausea and vomiting may occur, which along with sedation may place patients at grave risk for aspiration of stomach contents. At levels greater than 300mg percent, hypothermia (low body temperature) with impairment of level of consciousness is likely except in all but the most tolerant indi\u00ad viduals. Coma begins to be seen at levels of 400 to 600mg percent, but this is variable, again depending on tolerance. Although exceptions are found, BACs between 600 and 800mg per\u00ad cent are fatal. At this point, respiratory, car\u00ad diovascular, and body temperature controls fail. See Figure 4\u00ad2 for more symptoms of alco\u00ad hol intoxication. Since the elimination rate of alcohol from the body generally is 10 to 30mg percent per hour, the goals for the treatment of alcohol intoxica\u00ad tion are to preserve respiration and cardiovas\u00ad cular function until alcohol levels fall into a safe range. Patients who are severely intoxicat\u00ad ed and comatose as the result of alcohol use should be managed in the same manner as all comatose patients, with particular care taken in monitoring vital functions, protecting respi\u00ad ration, and observing aspiration, hypo\u00ad glycemia, and thiamin deficiency. Screening for other drugs that may contribute to the coma, as well as other sources of coma induction, should be done. Agitation is best managed with interpersonal and nursing approaches rather than additional medications, which may only complicate and delay the elimination of the alcohol. Withdrawal Signs and Symptoms Hippocrates, writing around 400 B.C., gave us our first written clinical picture of alcohol with\u00ad drawal when he wrote that if the patient is \" in the prime of life and if from drinking he has trembling hands,\" it may well be the case that the patient is showing withdrawal signs and symptoms. To this day, alcohol withdrawal remains underrecognized and undertreated. The signs and symptoms of acute alcohol with\u00ad drawal generally start 6 to 24 hours after the patient takes his last drink. Alcohol withdrawal may begin when the patient still has significant blood alcohol concentrations. The signs and symptoms may include the following: R estlessness, irritability, anxiety, agitation Anorexia (lack of appetite), nausea, vomiting Tremor (shakiness), elevated heart rate, increased blood pressure Insomnia, intense dreaming, nightmares Poor concentration, impaired memory and judgment Increased sensitivity to sound, light, and tac\u00ad tile sensations Hallucinations (auditory, visual, or tactile) Delusions, usually of paranoid or persecutory varieties Grand mal seizures (grand mal seizures rep\u00ad resent a severe, generalized, abnormal elec\u00ad trical discharge of the major portions of the brain, resulting in loss of consciousness, brief cessation of breathing, and muscle rigidity followed by muscle jerking; a brief period of Chapter 4 52 Figure 4\u00ad2 Symptoms of Alcohol Intoxication* Blood Alcohol Level Clinical Picture 20-100mg percent Mood and behavioral changes Reduced coordination Impairment of ability to drive a car or operate machinery 101-200mg percent Reduced coordination of most activities Speech impairment Trouble walking General impairment of thinking and judgment 201-300mg percent Marked impairment of thinking, memory, and coordination Marked reduction in level of alertness Memory blackouts Nausea and vomiting 301-400mg percent Worsening of above symptoms with reduction of body temperature and blood pressure Excessive sleepiness Amnesia 401-800mg percent Difficulty waking the patient (coma) Serious decreases in pulse, temperature, blood pressure, and rate of breath\u00ad ing Urinary and bowel incontinence Death *V aries greatly with level of tolerance (chronic users of alcohol may show less effect at any given blood alcohol level). Source: Consensus Panelist Robert Malcolm, M.D. s leep, awakening later with some mild to even severe confusion, generally occurs) Hyperthermia (high fever) Delirium with disorientation with regard to time, place, person, and situation; fluctua\u00ad tion in level of consciousness For a discussion of seizures and delirium, including delirium tremens, see below under the heading Management of Delirium and Seizures (p. 63). Mild alcohol withdrawal generally consists of anxiety, irritability, difficulty sleeping, and decreased appetite. Severe alcohol withdrawal usually is characterized by obvious trembling of the hands and arms, sweating, elevation of pulse (above 100) and blood pressure (greater Physical Detoxification Services for Withdrawal From Specific Substances 53 than 140/90), nausea (sometimes with vomit\u00ad ing), and hypersensitivity to noises (which seem louder than usual) and light (which appears brighter than usual). Brief periods of hearing and seeing things that are not present (auditory and visual hallucinations) also may occur. A fever greater than 101\u00b0 F also may be seen, though care should be taken to determine whether the fever is the result of an infection. Seizures and true delirium tremens, as dis\u00ad cussed elsewhere, represent the most extreme forms of severe alcohol withdrawal. Moderate alcohol withdrawal is defined more vaguely, but represents some features of both mild and severe withdrawal. The course of these symptoms is extremely variable. An individual may progress partial\u00adly through some of the symptoms noted above and then have a slow improvement. Other individuals may have mild to moderate symp\u00adtoms with almost abrupt resolution. Yet another group may present with a grand mal seizure or with hallucinations. Some people with alcohol dependence, regardless of their pattern of drinking or the extent of drinking, appear to develop minor symptoms or show no symptoms of withdrawal. Infrequent binge drinkers seem less likely to have withdrawal symptoms than individuals who are heavy regular users of alcohol who then abruptly cease their alcohol use, but this is not well substantiated. As previously discussed in the assessment section, the use of a standardized clinical rating instrument for withdrawal such as the CIWA\u00adAr is valuable because it guides the clinician through multiple domains of alcohol withdrawal and allows for semi\u00adquan\u00adtitative assessment of nausea, tremor, auto\u00adnomic hyperactivity, anxiety, agitation, per\u00adceptual disturbances, headache, and disorien\u00ad tation. Age, general health, nutritional fac\u00adtors, and possible co\u00adoccurring medical or psychiatric conditions all appear to play a role in increasing the severity of the symp\u00ad toms of alcohol withdrawal. The most useful clinical factors to assess the likelihood and the extent of a current with\u00addrawal is the patient's last withdrawal and the number of previous withdrawals (treated or untreated) experienced, with three or four being a particularly significant number for the appearance of severe withdrawal reac\u00adtions unless adequate medical care is provid\u00aded. This assumption that this phenomenon will manifest itself, which has been referred to as the \"kindling hypothesis,\" is well\u00adestab\u00ad lished in the research literature (Booth and Blow 1993; Wojnar et al. 1999). Uncomplicated or mild to moderate with\u00addrawal is characterized by restlessness, irri\u00adtability, anorexia (lack of appetite), tremor (shakiness), insomnia, impaired cognitive functions, and mild perceptual changes. Complicated or severe medical withdrawal has one or more elements of delirium, halluci\u00adnations, delusions, seizures, and disturbances of body temperature, pulse, and blood pres\u00adsure. Medical Complications of Alcohol Withdrawal: Possible Fatal Outcomes Seizures; delirium tremens (severe delirium with trembling); and dysregulation of body temperature, pulse, and blood pressure are outcomes in severe alcohol dependence that can lead to fatal consequences. Other medical com\u00ad plications of alcohol withdrawal include infec\u00ad tions, hypoglycemia, gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, undetected trauma, hepatic failure, cardiomyopathy (dilation of the heart with ineffective pumping), pancreatitis (inflamma\u00ad tion of the pancreas), and encephalopathy (generalized impaired brain functioning). The suspicion of impending complications or their appearance will require hospitalization of the client and possible intensive care unit level of management. Consultation with internists spe\u00ad cializing in infectious neurologists; psychi\u00ad atrists; anesthesiologists; and other specialists also may be warranted, depending on the nature of the complications. Chapter 4 54 Management of Withdrawal Without Medication The management of an individual in alcohol withdrawal without medication is a difficult matter because the indications for this have not been established firmly through scientific stud\u00ad ies or any evidence\u00adbased methods. Furthermore, the course of alcohol withdrawal is unpredictable and currently available tech\u00ad niques of screening and assessment do not allow us to predict with confidence who will or will not experience life\u00adthreatening complica\u00ad tions. Severe alcohol withdrawal may be associ\u00ad ated with seizures due to relative impairment of gamma\u00adaminobutyric acid (GABA) and relative over\u00adactivity of N\u00admethyl\u00adD\u00adaspartate systems (a subtype of the excitatory glutamate receptor system) (Moak and Anton 1996). The failure to treat incipient convulsions is a deviation from the established general standard of care. Positive aspects of the nonmedication approach are that it is highly cost\u00adeffective and provides inexpensive access to detoxifica\u00adtion for individuals seeking aid. Observation is generally better than no treatment, but people in moderate to severe withdrawal will be best served at a higher level of care. Young individuals in good health, with no history of previous withdrawal reactions, may be well served by management of withdrawal without medication. However, personnel supervising in this setting should possess assessment abili\u00adties and be able to summon help through the emergency medical system. Methods of with\u00addrawal management without medication include frequent interpersonal support, pro\u00ad vision of adequate fluids and food, attention to hygiene, adequate sleep, and the mainte\u00adnance of a no\u00adalcohol/no\u00addrug environment. Social Detoxification Social detoxification programs are defined as short\u00adterm, nonmedical treatment services for individuals with substance use disorders. A social detoxification program offers room, board, and interpersonal support to intoxicat\u00ad ed individuals and individuals in substance use w ithdrawal. Th e consensus panel has found that in actual practice, social detoxification programs vary greatly in their approach and scope. Some programs offer some medical and nursing onsite supervision, while others pro\u00ad vide access to medical and nursing evalua\u00ad tion For alcohol, sedative\u00adhypnotic, and opioid with\u00ad drawal syndromes, hospitalization (or some form of 24\u00adhour medical care) is generally the preferred setting for detoxification, based on principles of safety and humani\u00ad tarian concerns. urgent care pro\u00ad grams, and emergen\u00ad cy departments. Some social detoxifi\u00ad cation programs only offer basic room and board for a \" cold turkey\" detoxifica\u00ad tion, while other pro\u00ad grams offer medica\u00ad tions. Sometimes medications are pre\u00ad scribed at the onset of withdrawal by health\u00ad care professionals in an outpatient setting, while the staff in the social detoxification program supervises the administration of these medications. Whatever the partic\u00ad ular situation might be, there should always be medical surveillance, includ\u00ad ing monitoring of vital signs, as part of every social detoxification program. The consensus panel agrees that for alcohol, sedative\u00adhypnotic, and opioid withdrawal syn\u00ad dromes, hospitalization (or some form of 24\u00ad hour medical care) is generally the preferred setting for detoxification, based on principles of safety and humanitarian concerns. When hos\u00ad pitalization cannot be provided, a setting that provides a high level of nursing and medical backup 24 hours a day, 7 days a week is desir\u00ad able. The panel readily acknowledges that social detoxification programs are, for some Physical Detoxification Services for Withdrawal From Specific Substances 55 communities, the only available resources for uninsured, homeless individuals. Social detoxi\u00ad fication is preferable to detoxification in unsu\u00ad pervised settings such as the street, shelters, or jails. The panel also notes that in some large urban areas, social detoxification programs have longstanding, excellent reputations of pro\u00ad viding high\u00adquality supervision and nurturance for their clients. Social detoxification p rograms are orga\u00adFor a substantial group of individuals, substance use withdrawal syndromes do not lead to fatal outcomes or even significant morbidity. nized and funded by a variety of sources, including faith\u00adbased organizations, com\u00ad munity charities, and municipal and other local govern\u00ad ments. The genesis of social detoxification is complex. Often, these programs grew out of community needs when no other alternatives were available. Early reports (Whitfield et al. 1978) indicated that many individu\u00ad als in alcohol with\u00ad drawal could be managed successful\u00ad ly without medications in a social detoxification setting. Subsequent reviews that have revisited the topic (Lapham et al. 1996) have reached similar conclusions. Critical analysis of these reports by the consensus panel indicates that some of the scientific issues were oversimplified and misleading. A number of these studies, in fact, excluded many seriously ill clients from their surveys prior to referral to social detoxifi\u00ad cation. Some of these surveys had a very high staff\u00adto\u00adclient ratio during social detoxification, thus providing an unusually high level of psy\u00ad chological support. This level of staffing is not frequently found today in social detoxification programs. The consensus panel acknowledges that, for a substantial group of individuals, substance use withdrawal syndromes do not lead to fatal outcomes or even significant morbidity. Determining which individuals will have benign outcomes often is difficult, and in fact this determination prior to social detoxifica\u00adtion referral frequently is not made. Some incorrect beliefs have sprung up in the con\u00adtext of social detoxification: Individuals undergoing opioid withdrawal often are con\u00adsidered to require hospitalization to alleviate suffering, while individuals undergoing alco\u00adhol withdrawal sometimes are, for a variety of reasons, denied hospital\u00adlevel treatment for detoxification, even though alcohol withdraw\u00adal produces suffering and may have fatal con\u00adsequences. The consensus panel agreed on several guide\u00adlines for social detoxification programs: Such programs should follow local govern\u00ad mental regulations regarding their licensing and inspection. It is highly desirable that individuals entering social detoxification be assessed by primary care practitioners (physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners) with some experience in substance abuse treatment. Such an assessment should determine whether the patient currently is intoxicated and the degree of intoxication, the type of withdrawal syndrome, severity of the with\u00ad drawal, information regarding past with\u00ad drawals, and the presence of co\u00adoccurring psychiatric, medical, and surgical conditions that might well require specialized care (see chapter 3, Figure 3\u00ad1, p. 25). Particular attention should be paid to those individuals who have undergone multiple withdrawals in the past and for whom each withdrawal appears to be worse than previ\u00ad ous ones\u2014this is the so\u00adcalled \"kindling effect\" (Ballenger and 1978; Booth and Blow Malcolm et al. 2000; Shaw et al. 1998; Wojnar et al. 1999; Worner 1996). Subjects with a history of severe with\u00ad drawals, multiple withdrawals, delirium Chapter 4 56 tremens, or seizures are not good candidates for social detoxification programs. All social detoxification programs should have an alcohol\u00adand drug\u00adfree environment, have personnel who are familiar with the fea\u00ad tures of substance use withdrawal syn\u00ad dromes, have training in basic life support, and have access to an emergency medical sys\u00ad tem that can provide transportation to emer\u00ad gency departments and other sites of clinical care. Management of Withdrawal With Medications Over the last 15 years several reviews and posi\u00ad tion papers (Fuller and Gordis 1994; Mayo\u00adSmith 1997; Nutt et al. 1989; Shaw 1995) have asserted that only a minority of patients with alcoholism will in fact go into significant alcohol withdrawal requiring medi\u00ad cations. Identifying that significant minority sometimes is problematic, but there are signs and symptoms of impending problems that can alert the caretaker to seek medical attention. Deciding on whether to use medical manage\u00adment for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal requires that patients be separated into three groups. The first and most obvious group comprises those clients who have had a previ\u00adous history of the most extreme forms of with\u00addrawal, that of seizures and/or delirium. This group is discussed in more detail below, but in general, the medication treatment of this group in early abstinence, whether or not they have had the initiation of withdrawal symptoms, should proceed as quickly as pos\u00ad sible. The second group of patients requiring imme\u00ad diate medication treatment includes those patients who are already in withdrawal and demonstrating moderate symptoms of with\u00addrawal. The third group of patients includes those who may still be intoxicated and therefore have not had time to develop withdrawal symptoms or who have, at the time of admis\u00adsion, been abstinent for a few hours and have not developed signs or symptoms of withdraw\u00adal. A decision regarding medication for this group should be in part based on age, num\u00adber of years of alcohol dependence, and the number of previously treated or untreated severe withdrawals (three or four appears to be a significant threshold in predicting future serious withdrawal) (Shaw 1995). If there is an opportunity to observe the patient in the emergency department of the clinic or similar setting over the next 6 to 8 hours, then it is possible to delay a decision regarding treat\u00adment and periodically reevaluate a client of this category. If this is not possible, then the return of the patient to a setting in which there is some supervision by family, signifi\u00adcant others, or in a social detoxification pro\u00adgram is desirable. The decision as to whether to give the patient a single medication dose prior to discharge and perhaps provide one or two additional medication doses to be administered in the referral setting rests on adequacy of supervi\u00adsion, the probability of whether the patient will drink while undergoing treatment, and whether the patient can or will return for assessments the following day. In some cir\u00adcumstances, no treatment may be safer than treatment with medication. Mayo\u00adSmith (1997) has shown that benzodiazepines confer protection against alcohol withdrawal seizures and thus patients with previous seizures should be treated early. The same applies to delirium. Both of these topics will be explored in greater detail in the next section. Extremely heavy drinking in the weeks prior to complete cessation also predicts more severe withdrawal (Lejoyeux et al. 1998), but confirming such a history often is difficult. A less accepted and more controversial posi\u00ad tion on the indications for medication treat\u00adment for alcohol withdrawal springs from studies that attempt to measure oxidative stress, which is the formation of oxidative free radicals (chemicals that damage pro\u00adteins), and stress hormones during alcohol withdrawal (Dupont et al. 2000; Tsai et al. Physical Detoxification Services for Withdrawal From Specific Substances 57 1998). These studies have asserted that indi\u00ad viduals who are undergoing mild withdrawal without treatment still have the formation of toxic oxidative products which have the hypo\u00adthetical potential of producing neuronal dam\u00adage and perhaps some cell death. Lending support to this argument is the fact that alco\u00adhol withdrawal appears to be progressive in that it worsens with each successive episode (Malcolm et al. 2000) and that some patients dependent on alcohol develop evidence of dementia over time. On the other hand, age, nutritional status, trauma, co\u00adoccurring con\u00additions, and other unspecified events also probably contribute to this process. The decision to treat a patient in alcohol withdrawal or at potential risk for alcohol withdrawal will in great part rest on the clini\u00adcal judgment of the practitioner, relying on the factors noted above in addition to the issue of whether treatment may in fact actual\u00adly do more harm than good. This topic is dis\u00adcussed below under the heading Limitations of Benzodiazepines in Outpatient Treatment (p. 60). For more information about medica\u00ad tion\u00adassisted treatment, see TIP 43, Medication\u00adAssisted Treatment for Opioid Addiction in Opioid Treatment Programs (CSAT 2005d). Benzodiazepine treatment of alcohol withdrawal Depending upon the clinical setting and the patient circumstances, there are several accept\u00ad able regimens for treating alcohol withdrawal that make use of benzodiazepines. These drugs remain the medication class of choice for treat\u00ad ing alcohol withdrawal. The early recognition of alcohol withdrawal and prompt administra\u00ad tion of a suitable benzodiazepine usually will prevent the withdrawal reaction from proceed\u00ad ing to serious consequences. Patients suspected of alcohol withdrawal should be seen promptly by a primary care provider (physician, nurse practitioner, physician assistant) who has expe\u00ad rience in diagnosing and managing alcohol withdrawal. Practitioners are reminded that benzodiazepines have side effects and limita\u00ad tions. These limitations are far more prominent when treating alcohol withdrawal in an outpa\u00ad tient setting. Loading dose of a benzodiazepine Medical or nursing administration of a slowly metabolized benzodiazepine, frequently intra\u00ad venously, but sometimes orally, may be carried out every 1 to 2 hours until significant clinical improvement occurs (such as reducing the CIWA\u00adAr score to 10 or less) or the patient becomes sedated (Sellers and Naranjo 1985). Patients at grave risk for the most severe com\u00ad plications of alcohol withdrawal or who are already experiencing severe withdrawal should be hospitalized and can be treated with this regimen. In general, patients with severe with\u00ad drawal may receive 20mg of diazepam or 100mg of chlordiazepoxide every 2 to 3 hours until improvement or sedation prevails. Oversedation, ataxia (lack of muscular coordi\u00ad nation), and confusion, particularly in elderly patients, may occur with this protocol. The treatment staff should closely monitor hemody\u00ad namic (blood pressure and pulse) and respira\u00ad tory features. They should particularly be pre\u00ad pared to detect and rapidly treat apnea (no breathing) with assisted ventilation. Having experienced staff with adequate time to fre\u00ad quently monitor the patient and provide intra\u00ad venous medication is necessary. Symptom\u00adtriggered therapy Using the CIWA\u00adAr or similar alcohol with\u00ad drawal rating scales, medical personnel can be trained to recognize signs and symptoms of alcohol withdrawal, make a rating, and based on that rating administer benzodiazepines to their patients only when signs and symptoms reach a particular threshold score. Studies have demonstrated that appropriate training of nurses in the application of the CIWA\u00adAr dra\u00ad matically reduces the number of patients who need to receive symptom\u00adtriggered medication (Saitz et al. 1994; Wartenberg et al. 1990). This regimen has been used successfully with short, intermediate, and long half\u00adlife benzodi\u00ad azepines. Chapter 4 58 The training of staff in a standardized proce\u00ad dure of administering rating scales is impor\u00adtant and periodic retraining to ensure contin\u00adued reliability among raters is essential. A typical routine of administration of symptom\u00adtriggered therapy is as follows: Administer 50mg of chlordiazepoxide (Librium) for CIWA\u00adAr > 9 and reassess in 1 hour. Continue administering 50mg chlordiazepox\u00adide every hour until CIWA\u00adAr is < 10. Dosage amount and frequency can be modified depending on the individual clinical situation as determined by the medical provider. Patients with a history of withdrawal seizures should receive scheduled doses of a long\u00adact\u00ading benzodiazepine (e.g., diazepam [Valium], 20mg every 6 hours for 3 days) regardless of CIWA\u00adAr score, and should receive addition\u00adal doses if indicated by elevated CIWA\u00adAr score. It must be noted here that symptom\u00adtriggered therapy is not recommended for outpatient detoxification. Symptom\u00adtriggered therapy requires monitoring and decision\u00admaking by a healthcare professional. Gradual, tapering doses Before beginning any tapering regimen, the patient must be fully stabilized; that is, all signs and symptoms of withdrawal must be improved. Without proper stabilization, no tapering scheme will succeed. Once the patient has been stabilized, oral benzodiazepines can be administered on a predetermined dosing schedule for several days and gradually tapered over time. This is a commonly used regimen. Dosing protocols vary widely among treat\u00ad ment facilities based on the needs of the patient population. One example is that patients might receive 50mg of chlordiazepox\u00ad ide or 10mg of diazepam every 6 hours during the first day of treatment and 25mg of chlor\u00addiazepoxide or 5mg of diazepam every 6 hours on the second and third days. This approach to dosing, that is, every 6 hours, is not as accurate in tailoring medications to counter symptoms; a more precise dosing reg\u00ad imen is titrating (adjusting dosage in light of drug response) according to severity of symp\u00ad toms. An alternative regimen might be the administration of 1 to 2mg lorazepam two or three times a day the first day, followed by gradual reduction over the next 3 to 5 days. The general approach to tapering is to estab\u00adlish an acute dose in the first 24 hours, then to reduce it over the next three days: for example, 400 chlordiazepoxide total on day 1, then 300, 200, 100, and off on day 5. This has to be extended if lorazepam is used. Doses of withdrawal Benzodiazepines remain the medication class of choice for treating alcohol withdrawal. medication are omit\u00adted if the patient is sleeping soundly, showing signs of oversedation, or exhibiting marked ataxia. The use of gradual, tapering doses is appealing in settings where trained nurs\u00ading or medical observations cannot be made frequently; however, this in itself is a pitfall. Under\u00ad or overmedication with this regimen can occur depending on benzodiazepine toler\u00adance; the presence of chronic cigarette smok\u00ading, which induces metabolism; liver function; age; and the pres\u00adence of co\u00adoccurring medical or psychiatric conditions. The use of this regimen may be problematic in the outpatient settings in which it frequently is applied. Supplying the patient with 4 to 5 days of a benzodiazepine and facing the probability that the patient may drink and take the benzodiazepine is a hazard. It is important to enforce strict limi\u00adtations on driving automobiles, climbing, or operating hazardous machinery. Physical Detoxification Services for Withdrawal From Specific Substances 59 Single daily dosing protocol Jauhar and Anderson (2000) compared single daily dosing of diazepam to multiple daily dos\u00ad ing of chlordiazepoxide in inpatients being treated for alcohol withdrawal. Patients in the diazepam single daily dose group did as well as the chlordiazepoxide multiple dosing group. The authors suggest that this regimen might be attractive in community or social detoxification settings, particularly if patients could be moni\u00ad tored between administered doses. Further study with a larger group of patients is needed. The choice of the specific benzodiazepine for any particular regimen depends on a number of factors, but the most significant factor is that the clinician administer one that she has the most experience using. Despite 30 years of research, no single benzodiazepine has emerged as the number one drug of choice in treating alcohol withdrawal. All benzodiazepines stud\u00ad ied have worked better than placebo but have been roughly equivalent with each other. Many clinicians prefer long half\u00adlife benzodiazepines such as chlordiazepoxide and diazepam, desir\u00ad ing less frequent daily dosing, relatively steady serum levels, and the ability of these drugs to self\u00adtaper based on their long half\u00adlives. Diazepam and chlordiazepoxide Both diazepam and chlordiazepoxide have excellent rapid oral absorption and are avail\u00ad able for intravenous (IV) use. Intramuscular use of these drugs is to be discouraged since muscle absorption is erratic. One study sug\u00ad gests that if chlordiazepoxide (Librium) is taken in overdose with alcohol, it is less likely to be fatal than diazepam (Valium) (Serfaty and Masterton 1993). Detractors of the use of these two drugs point out that they have long half\u00adlives (although some clinicians see this as an advantage because it prevents the emer\u00ad gence of withdrawal symptoms between doses), have multiple active metabolites, and go through many oxidative metabolic steps in the liver. Older patients or patients with liver dis\u00ad ease are likely to accumulate these medications quickly without being able to metabolize them. Possible consequences include oversedation or ataxia, and on rare occasions, confusion may ensue. Lorazepam Lorazepam (Ativan) has an intermediate half\u00ad life of about 8-15 hours, and although it usual\u00ad ly is administered in multiple doses each day, it can be given approximately twice per day. Lorazepam, with its shorter half\u00adlife and lack of storage in adipose (fatty) tissue, actually has to be given more frequently than the long\u00adact\u00ad ing preparations, not less. It is absorbed easily orally, intramuscularly, and intravenously. Older patients and patients with severe liver disease tolerate it well and it is an effective anticonvulsant in blocking a second alcohol withdrawal seizure (D'Onofrio et al. 1999). However, it has been suggested that seizures may occur late in detoxification with short\u00adact\u00ad ing benzodiazepines such as lorazepam and oxazepam (Shaw 1995). Oxazepam (Serax) often is favored by internists and hepatologists treating alcohol withdrawal in patients with severe liver failure. It has a rel\u00ad atively short half\u00adlife of 6 to 8 hours. Its metabolism is very simple and it has no metabolites. The agent is relatively limited in that its oral absorption is quite slow compared to other benzodiazepines, it must be given three to four times a day, and is only available in the United States in an oral form. Ultimately, the experience of the treating clini\u00ad cian, characteristics of the patient, and the set\u00ad ting in which he will be treated will determine the choice of drug. Although all benzodi\u00ad azepines are now generic in the United States, costs vary and this too may be a factor in choice. Limitations of benzodiazepines in outpatient treatment Although benzodiazepines remain the mainstay of treatment for alcohol withdrawal, they have limitations that are particularly pronounced when treating outpatients. Benzodiazepines' potential interactions with alcohol can lead to coma and respiratory suppression, motor inco\u00ad Chapter 4 60 ordination (leading to falls and automobile accidents), and abuse of the medications. Abuse usually is in the context of the concur\u00ad rent use of alcohol, opioids, or stimulants. There are two other limitations of benzodi\u00ad azepines that may be relevant in some clinical settings for some patients. First, although ben\u00ad zodiazepines have been studied for more than 30 years and are effective for suppressing alco\u00ad hol withdrawal symptoms at any one episode, their ability to halt the progressive worsening of each successive alcohol withdrawal reaction is in question. There are now at least nine stud\u00ad ies that have found that an ever\u00adincreasing number of previous alcohol withdrawals increases the severity of withdrawal, particu\u00ad larly seizures and delirium tremens, and decreases responsiveness to benzodiazepines (Ballenger and Post 1978; Booth and Blow 1993; Brown et al. 1988; Gross et al. 1972; Lechtenberg and Worner 1990, 1992; Malcolm et al. 2000; Shaw et al. 1998; Worner 1996). A tenth study (Wojnar et al. 1999) found that increasing severity of alcohol withdrawal symp\u00ad toms was observed only in a minority (22 per\u00ad cent) of 418 repeatedly treated clients. However, within this group of one in five indi\u00ad viduals, seizures were three times more com\u00ad mon than in the larger, nonprogressive group and premature age of death was 7 years younger than for the nonprogressive group. In the majority of these studies, patients were treated with benzodiazepines, although in a few, phenobarbital was used. A second, and at present more hypothetical, concern about benzodiazepine use to treat out\u00ad patients in alcohol withdrawal is that they may \" prime\" or reinstate alcohol use during their administration. Two preclinical studies support this premise (Deutsch and Walton 1977; Hedlund and Wahlstrom 1998). A recent ran\u00ad domized, blinded, clinical trial comparing car\u00ad bamazepine to lorazepam for the outpatient treatment of alcohol withdrawal found that the outpatients on lorazepam were three times as likely to drink as those on carbamazepine. The lorazepam group drank about twice as much alcohol in the immediate post\u00addetoxification period than the carbamazepine group (Malcolm et al. 2002). F or a list of potential contraindications to using benzodiazepines to treat alcohol withdrawal in certain patients, see Figure 4\u00ad3. Other medications Barbiturates Barbiturates have been used for nearly a cen\u00ad tury for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal. Most barbiturates, other than phenobarbital, have fallen into disfavor because of severe Figure 4\u00ad3 Potential Contraindications To Using Benzodiazepines To Treat Alcohol Withdrawal Previous allergic reaction Previous paradoxical disinhibition (e.g., violence, agitation, self\u00adharm) Previous serious adverse outcomes that could have medico\u00adlegal consequences if they re\u00adoccur (e.g., fractured hip, status epilepticus [continuous seizures of several minutes]) Severe alterations in mental status with low dose of benzodiazepines (e.g., confusion, delirium) An outpatient setting where benzodiazepine use with alcohol has occurred previously with extreme intox\u00ad ication leading to injuries, coma, or apnea Source: Consensus Panelist Robert Malcolm, M.D. Physical Detoxification Services for Withdrawal From Specific Substances 61 lethal interactions with alcohol, death Delirium and seizures are the two most pathological responses seen in alcohol withdrawal. from overdose of the agents alone, rapid tolerance, and high abuse potential. Barbiturates are highly addictive. In clinical practice, the medication is effec\u00ad tive both for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal and sedative\u00adhypnotic withdrawal although few controlled trials have been conduct\u00ad ed with it (Wilbur and Kulik 1981). Phenobarbital has a long half\u00adlife and may rapidly accumulate. Overdoses with phenobarbital also can be fatal. Members of the consensus panel recommend its use only in highly supervised settings. Anticonvulsants Anticonvulsants have been used in Europe for a quarter of a century for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal. Carbamazepine (Atretol, Tegretol) has been shown in at least three trials to be as effective as various benzodiazepines in mild to moderate alcohol withdrawal (Malcolm et al. 2001). Although less well studied, val\u00ad proic acid also has been shown to be effective (Reoux et al. 2001). Older, first\u00adgeneration anticonvulsants have limitations in that they only have been studied in mild to moderate withdrawal, can on rare occasions have serious hepatic and bone marrow toxicities, interact with several other classes of medication, and are only available in oral forms. They are not, however, controlled substances, are not abused, and as previously noted, carba\u00ad mazepine may have the propensity to reduce some of the indices of drinking behavior imme\u00ad diately in the post\u00adwithdrawal treatment of out\u00ad patients. Newer drugs such as tiagabine, oxcar\u00ad bazepine, and gabapentin do not appear to have these liabilities, but sufficient studies have not been done to confirm their effectiveness and safety. Other agents Beta blockers and alpha adrenergic agonists such as clonidine have been used in the treat\u00ad ment of alcohol withdrawal. They do not pre\u00ad vent seizures in delirium and have only modest benefits for ameliorating symptoms of with\u00ad drawal. However, some patients will have tachycardia (rapid heartbeat) and hyperten\u00ad sion (high blood pressure) that will not be con\u00ad trolled by benzodiazepines, and beta blockers and alpha adrenergic agonists can be of use in these patients. Calcium channel antagonists will also ameliorate some symptoms of alcohol with\u00ad drawal. As with beta blockers and clonidine, calcium channel antagonists should be consid\u00ad ered adjunctive therapy primarily to manage extreme hypertension during withdrawal. Antipsychotics Antipsychotics have long been used to control extreme agitation, hallucinations, delusions, and delirium during alcohol withdrawal. Older, low\u00adpotency drugs such as chlorpromazine gen\u00ad erally are avoided since they can reduce the seizure threshold. High\u00adpotency drugs such as haloperidol (Haldol) also can reduce the seizure threshold, but less commonly. Haloperidol and related agents are available for oral, intramuscular, and IV administration. Clinicians should note that since antipsychotics can lower the seizure threshold, their use dur\u00ad ing alcohol withdrawal should be undertaken with great care and close supervision of the patient is required. Relapse prevention agents Relapse prevention agents such as naltrexone and acamprosate are under consideration as additional therapies during late withdrawal treatment, although they are not effective for alcohol detoxification. Since one\u00adthird to one\u00ad half of outpatients detoxifying with benzodi\u00ad azepines will either drink or leave treatment prematurely, naltrexone and acamprosate may be valuable in assisting in reducing the proba\u00ad bility of the individual drinking during late detoxification. High\u00addose naltrexone therapy has been associated with some liver toxicity, but this has not been reported in individuals taking therapeutic doses to enhance relapse Chapter 4 62 prevention. Acamprosate may produce diar\u00ad rhea and this may be already present in some individuals in alcohol withdrawal. Thus far no well\u00adcontrolled studies have been conducted to provide guidelines as to when these medications should be introduced during detoxification or whether it would be better to wait until the early phase of rehabilitation. For an extended review, see Kranzler and Jaffe (2003). Other medications Abecarnil (Anton et al. 1997), and more recent\u00ad ly baclofen (Addolorato et al. 2002), have both shown promise in the treatment of alcohol with\u00ad drawal. However, insufficient information has been accumulated on these drugs, and there\u00ad fore they are not recommended for use in clini\u00ad cal patient settings. Their use in alcohol with\u00ad drawal should be considered experimental and premature for the present. Management of Delirium and Seizures Delirium and seizures are the two most patho\u00ad logic responses seen in alcohol withdrawal. The major goal of medical management is to avoid seizures and a special state of delirium called delirium tremens (DTs) with aggressive use of the primary detoxification drug (e.g., higher doses of a benzodiazepine). Prevention is essential where DTs are concerned. DTs do not develop suddenly but instead progress from earlier withdrawal symptoms. Properly admin\u00ad istered symptom\u00adtriggered medication approaches will prevent DTs and limit over\u00ad medication that can occur when high\u00addose ben\u00ad zodiazepines are administered without regard to clinical response. It can be challenging clini\u00ad cally to differentiate impending DTs versus benzodiazepine toxicity on day 3 of detoxifica\u00ad tion. When in doubt, in most cases it is safer to overmedicate than to undertreat and allow DTs to develop. Flumazenil (Romazicon) can be used to reverse benzodiazepine overdose. Death and disability may result from DTs or seizures without medical care. Several factors are related to severity of alcohol withdrawal: high amounts of alcohol being consumed in the weeks prior to treatment, the severity of the last withdrawal episodes, and the number of previously treated or untreated withdrawal episodes. Other factors such as increasing age; the patient's general health, including nutri\u00ad tional status; of co\u00adoccurring med\u00ad ical, surgical, and psychiatric disorders; and the use of medications (prescription, over\u00adthe\u00ad counter, or herbal) also can amplify severity of withdrawal symptoms. Early proper medical management of alcohol withdrawal reduces the probability of these complications, assuming early recognition. For patients with a history of DTs or seizures, early benzodiazepine treatment is indicated at the first clinical contact setting (e.g., doctor's office, clinic, urgent care, emergency depart\u00ad ment). Patients with severe withdrawal symp\u00ad toms, multiple past detoxifications (more than three), and co\u00adoccurring unstable medical and psychiatric conditions should be managed simi\u00ad larly. Once an initial clinical screening and assess\u00ad ment have been made, and the diagnosis is rea\u00ad sonably certain, medication should be given. Giving the patient a benzodiazepine should not be delayed by waiting for the return of labora\u00ad tory studies, transportation problems, or the availability of a hospital bed. Early thiamine and multivitamin administration also should be done at this time. Once full DTs have devel\u00ad oped, they tend to run their course despite medication management, and there is little evi\u00ad dence in the medical literature to suggest that any medication treatment can immediately abort DTs. Patients presenting in severe DTs should have emergency medical transport to a qualified emergency department and generally will require hospitalization. If the DTs are severe, patients may need to be placed in an intensive care unit (ICU), and in such settings continu\u00ad ous monitoring of cardiac rhythm, pulse, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, temperature, and respiration rates begins with the emergency medical system and continues in the emergency department and ICU. Physical Detoxification Services for Withdrawal From Specific Substances 63 Early care will depend on medical and surgical complications and may involve protocols from advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) and/or advanced trauma life support. Correction of fluids and electrolytes (salts in the blood), hyperthermia (high fever), and hypertension are vital. Loading doses (rapid administration of initial high doses) of IV diazepam or lorazepam are recommended, as are IV thi\u00ad amine (prior to IV glucose) and multiple vita\u00ad mins. physician should consider intramus\u00ad cular or intravenous haloperidol (Haldol and others) to treat agitation and hallucinations. Nursing care is vital, with particular attention to medication administration, patient comfort, soft restraints, and frequent contact with ori\u00ad enting responses and clarification of environ\u00ad mental misperceptions. Alcohol withdrawal seizures represent another management challenge (Ahmed et al. 2000), since no large\u00adscale clinical studies have been conducted to establish firmly best treatment practices. The majority of alcohol withdrawal seizures occur within the first 48 hours after cessation or reduction of alcohol, with peak incidence around 24 hours (Victor and Adams 1953). Most alcohol withdrawal seizures are singular, but if more than one occurs they tend to be within several hours of each other. While alcohol withdrawal seizures can occur several days out, a higher index of suspicion for other causes is prudent. Someone experiencing an alcohol withdrawal seizure is at greater risk for progressing to DTs, whereas it is extremely unlikely that a patient already in DTs will also then experience a seizure. The occurrence of an alcohol withdrawal seizure happens quickly, usually without warn\u00ad ing to the individual experiencing the seizure or anyone around him. The patient loses con\u00ad sciousness, and if seated usually slumps over, but if standing will immediately fall to the floor. The patient's body is rigid, and breathing ceas\u00ad es. This part of the seizure is called the tonic phase, which usually lasts for a few seconds and rarely more than a minute. The next part of the seizure (more dramatic and generally remembered by witnesses) con\u00adsists of jerking of head, neck, arms, and legs. Breathing resumes during this clonic phase of the seizure but may be irregular. During the clonic phase, the lips, tongue, or inside of the cheeks may be bitten. Involuntary urination or a bowel movement may occur. Immediately after the jerking ceases, the patient generally has a period of what appears to be sleep with more regular breathing. Vomiting may occur at this time. The period of sleep may be a few sec\u00ad onds with awakening or a few minutes. Rarely, the patient may appear not to waken at all and have a second period of rigidity followed by muscle jerking. This is known as status epilep\u00ad ticus. Upon awakening, the individual usually is mildly confused as to what has happened and may be disoriented as to where she or he is. This period of post\u00adseizure confusion generally lasts only for a few minutes but may persist for several hours in some patients. Headache, sleepiness, nausea, and sore muscles may per\u00ad sist in some individuals for a few hours. See the text box on the next page for what to do in the event of a seizure. Patients who start to retch or vomit should be gently placed on their side so that the vomitus (stomach contents vomited) may exit the mouth and not be taken into the lungs. Vomitus taken into the lungs is a severe medical condition leading to immediate difficulty breathing and, within hours, severe pneumonia. Predicting who will have a seizure during alco\u00ad hol withdrawal cannot be accomplished with any great certainty. There are some factors that clearly increase the risk of a seizure, but even in individuals with all of these factors, most patients will not have a seizure. Out of 100 people experiencing alcohol withdrawal only two or three of them will have a seizure. The best single predictor of a future alcohol withdrawal seizure is a previous alcohol with\u00ad drawal seizure. Individuals who have had three or more documented withdrawal episodes in the past are much more likely to have a seizure regardless of other factors including age, gen\u00ad der, or overall medical health. However, cer\u00ad tain other factors may increase the risk of seizures for all patients: Chapter 4 64 What To Do in the Event of a Seizure At the first sign of what appears to be a seizure, lay witnesses should summon trained medical personnel. Depending on the setting, this may mean calling 911 or calling the nurse or physician who is on duty for the clinic or hospital unit. While awaiting medical help, a layperson witnessing an alcohol withdrawal seizure should gently attempt to prevent injury to the person as he or she slumps or falls to the floor by protecting the individual's head and body from hard or sharp objects. Often, though, the initial loss of consciousness and fall is not seen by anyone. In the jerking phase of the seizure, if the jerking is extreme, it is important to protect the head from extreme head\u00adbanging by placing a soft object under the head and neck. Sometimes placing one's hand or shoe under the head is adequate. No attempt should be made to insert anything in the mouth (such as spoons, pencils, pens, tongue blades). Such attempts at object insertion may cause damage to the teeth and tongue, or objects may get partially swallowed and obstruct the airway. Patients who start to retch or vomit should be gently placed on their side so that the vomitus (stomach contents vomited) may exit the mouth and not be taken into the lungs. Vomitus taken into the lungs is a severe medical condition leading to immediate difficulty breathing and, within hours, severe pneumonia. Even if the individual appears to become fully awake, alert, and oriented without any harm following a seizure, it is strongly recommended that he be referred for medical evaluation. Individuals who awaken confused and disoriented should be given brief reassuring and soothing messages to reorient them as to what happened and where they are. Having drunk for more than two decades Having poor general medical health and poor nutritional status Having had previous head injuries Having had disturbances of serum calcium, sodium, potassium, or magnesium Patients having a witnessed seizure can be treated with IV diazepam or lorazepam and ACLS protocol procedures. This reduces but does not completely prevent the likelihood of a second seizure (D'Onofrio et al. 1999). In the rare patient with recurrent multiple seizures or status epilepticus (continuous seizures of sever\u00ad al minutes) an anesthesiology consultation may be required for general anesthesia. Evaluation of electrolyte disturbances, central nervous sys\u00ad tem (CNS) trauma, and consideration of seda\u00ad tive\u00adhypnotic withdrawal should be reviewed. Patients who have had a single witnessed or suspected alcohol withdrawal seizure should be immediately given a benzodiazepine, preferably with IV administration. The study by D'Onofrio and colleagues (1999) indicated that a single dose of 1mg of IV lorazepam reduced recurrent seizure risk, reduced rates of return to emergency departments, and low\u00adered hospitalization rates. Despite this report, the consensus panel agrees that hospi\u00adtalization for further detoxification treatment is strongly advised to monitor and ameliorate other withdrawal symptoms, reduce suffering, and stabilize the patient for rehabilitation treatment. The addition of anti\u00adepileptic drugs (AEDs) has not been established as effective (Chance 1991; Hillbom and Hjelm\u00adJager 1984; Rathlev et al. 1994). This is primarily based on evalu\u00adations of phenytoin (Dilantin and others). Newer AEDs have not been studied extensive\u00adly for preventing alcohol withdrawal seizures. The consensus panel suggests that AED thera\u00adpy should be considered in alcohol withdraw\u00adal patients with multiple past seizures (of any cause), a history of recent head injury, past Physical Detoxification Services for Withdrawal From Specific Substances 65 meningitis, encephalitis, or family history of seizures. Further evaluation of a first seizure often warrants neurologic evaluation (com\u00adputerized tomography and electroencephalo\u00adgram), even if the seizure may be suspected to have been due to alcohol withdrawal. Patient Care and Comfort Interpersonal support and hygienic care along with adequate nutrition should be provided. Staff assisting patients in detoxification should provide whatever assistance is necessary to help get patients cleaned up after entering the facility and bathed thoroughly as soon as they have been medically stabilized. Attention to the treatment of scabies, body lice, and other skin conditions should be given. Screening for tuberculosis should be done. Dental and oral care should be made available. The patient should be screened for physical trauma, including bruises and lacerations. Tetanus immunization may be necessary. Patients with an altered mental status or altered level of con\u00ad sciousness should be seen in emergency depart\u00ad ments, evaluated, and possibly hospitalized. Staff should continue to observe patients for head injuries after admission because some head injuries, such as subdural hematomas, may not immediately be evident and cost con\u00ad siderations may preclude obtaining a brain scan in some settings. Other Immediate Concerns Alcohol may interact with several classes of medicine to produce serious CNS depression. Some examples include benzodiazepines, medicines can produce CNS suppression. A disulfi\u00ad ram\u00adlike (Antabuse) reaction characterized by flushing, sweating, tachycardia, nausea, and chest pain has been reported for metronidazole and several antibiotics including, but not limit\u00ad ed to, cefamandole, cefoperazone, and cefote\u00ad tan. Acetaminophen in low doses may act acutely with alcohol to produce hepatotoxicity (liver damage). Clinicians also should deter\u00admine whether the patient is using aspirin or nonsteroidal anti\u00adinflammatory medications (for example, Motrin or Advil, both containing ibuprofen) in conjunction with alcohol use. Antidiabetic agents in concert with alcohol may produce hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) and lactic acidosis (blood that has become too acidic). The therapeutic efficacy and margin of safety for the use of anti\u00adanxiety medications, antidepressants, and antipsychotic medication is thought by some to be lessened by alcohol use, but this is based largely on anecdotal information. Alcohol interacts with numerous other classes of medications that lead to less serious results. Some important examples are sedatives, tranquilizers, antiseizure medica\u00ad tions, and anticoagulants (blood thinners) such as Coumadin. Patients who may be taking such medications need to be carefully observed and have their medications carefully monitored. Opioids Opioids are highly addicting, and their chronic use leads to withdrawal symptoms that, although not medically dangerous, can be high\u00ad ly unpleasant and produce intense discomfort. All opioids (e.g., heroin, morphine, hydromor\u00ad phone, oxycodone, codeine, and methadone) produce similar effects by interacting with endogenous (produced by the body itself) opi\u00ad oid (:, *, and 6) receptors (that is, specific sites on cells where these substances bind to the cell). Opioid agonists stimulate these receptors and opioid antagonists block them, preventing their action. Opioid Withdrawal Symptoms All opioid agents produce similar withdrawal signs and symptoms with some variance in severity, time of onset, and duration of symp\u00ad tomatology, depending on the agent used, the duration of use, the daily dose, and the interval between doses. For instance, heroin withdrawal typically begins 8 to 12 hours after the last heroin dose and subsides within a period of 3 to 5 days. Methadone withdrawal typically begins 36 to 48 hours after the last dose, peaks Chapter 4 66 after about 3 days, and gradually subsides over a period of 3 weeks or longer. Physiological, genetic, and psychological factors can signifi\u00ad cantly affect intoxication and withdrawal sever\u00ad ity. Figure 4\u00ad4 summarizes many of the com\u00ad mon signs and symptoms of opioid intoxication and withdrawal. The clinician uses intoxication and withdraw\u00ad al measures as guides to avoid under\u00ad or over\u00admedicating patients during medically super\u00advised detoxification; the number and intensity of signs determine the severity of opioid with\u00addrawal. It is important to appreciate that untreated opioid withdrawal gradually builds in severity of signs and symptoms and then diminishes in a self\u00adlimited manner. Repeated assessments should be made during detoxifi\u00ad cation to determine whether symptoms are improving or worsening. Repeated assess\u00adments also should address the effectiveness of pharmacological interventions. Detoxification strategies should aim to establish control over the opioid withdrawal syndrome, after which dose reductions can be made gradually. Medical complications associated with opioid withdrawal can develop and should be quick\u00adly identified and treated. Unlike alcohol and sedative withdrawal, uncomplicated opioid withdrawal is not life\u00adthreatening. Rarely, severe gastrointestinal symptoms produced by opioid withdrawal, such as vomiting or diar\u00adrhea, can lead to dehydration or electrolyte imbalance. Most individuals can be treated with oral fluids, especially fluids containing electrolytes, and some might require intra\u00advenous therapies. In addition, underlying cardiac illness could be made worse in the presence of the autonomic arousal (increased blood pressure, increased pulse, sweating) that is characteristic of opioid withdrawal. Fever may be present during opioid with\u00addrawal and typically will respond to detoxifi\u00adcation. Other causes of fever should be evalu\u00adated, particularly with intravenous users, Figure 4\u00ad4 Signs and Symptoms of Opioid Intoxication and Withdrawal Opioid Intoxication Opioid Withdrawal Signs Bradycardia (slow pulse) Hypotension (low blood pressure) Hypothermia (low body temperature) Sedation Meiosis (pinpoint pupils) Hypokinesis (slowed movement) Slurred speech Head nodding Symptoms Euphoria Analgesia (pain\u00adkilling effects) Calmness Signs Tachycardia (fast pulse) Hypertension (high blood pressure) Hyperthermia (high body temperature) Insomnia Mydriasis (enlarged pupils) Hyperreflexia (abnormally heightened reflexes) Diaphoresis (sweating) Piloerection (gooseflesh) Increased respiratory rate Lacrimation (tearing), yawning Rhinorrhea (runny nose) Muscle spasms Symptoms Abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea Bone and muscle pain Anxiety Source: Consensus Panelist Charles Dackis, M.D. Physical Detoxification Services for Withdrawal From Specific Substances 67 because HIV infec\u00ad tion, viral hepati\u00ad Methadone is the most frequently used agent approved for detoxification by the FDA, and a new medication, buprenorphine, has been approved for use. tis, abscesses, infected injection sites, and pneumo\u00adnia occur common\u00adly in this popula\u00adtion and always require medical attention. Anxiety disorders, especial\u00adly those involving panic anxiety, also might show increased intensity during opioid with\u00addrawal. Finally, any condition involving pain is likely to worsen during opioid with\u00addrawal because of a reduced pain threshold and the lack of analgesia (pain relief) afford\u00aded by opioid use. This phenomenon is particularly common with dental pain and chronic back pain. Management of Withdrawal Without Medications It is not recommended that clinicians attempt to manage significant opioid withdrawal symp\u00ad toms (causing discomfort and lasting several hours) without the effective detoxification agents discussed below. Even mild levels of opi\u00ad oid use commonly produce uncomfortable lev\u00ad els of withdrawal symptomatology. Management of this syndrome without medica\u00ad tions can produce needless suffering in a popu\u00ad lation that tends to have limited tolerance for physical pain. Management of Withdrawal With Medications The management of opioid withdrawal with medications is most commonly achieved through the use of methadone (in addition to adjunctive medications for nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and stomach cramps). Federal regu\u00ad lations restrict the use of methadone for opioid withdrawal to specially licensed programs, except in cases where the patient is hospitalized for treatment of another acute medical condi\u00ad tion. Methadone is the most frequently used agent approved for detoxification by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and a new medication, buprenorphine (discussed below), has been approved for use. Methadone can be used for detoxification from heroin and all opi\u00ad oid agonists. Another commonly used agent is clonidine (Gold et al. 1984), an a\u00adadrenergic agonist that relieves most opioid withdrawal symp\u00adtoms without producing opioid intoxication or drug reward. However, since clonidine detox\u00adification is less effective against many opioid withdrawal symptoms, adjunctive medicines often are necessary to treat insomnia, muscle pain, bone pain, and headache. Adjunctive agents should not be used in the place of an adequate detoxification dosage. Additional opioid agonists could be used theoretically for detoxification but would have to be adminis\u00adtered \"off label,\" because the FDA has approved only methadone for this purpose. Off\u00adlabel use (prescribing an agent approved for another condition) could be difficult to justify, given the efficacy of methadone in reversing opioid withdrawal. Detoxification is indicated for treatment\u00adseek\u00ading persons who display signs and symptoms sufficient to warrant treatment with medica\u00adtions and for whom maintenance is declined or for some reason is not indicated or practi\u00adcal. In addition, individuals dependent on opioids sometimes are hospitalized for other health problems and may require hospital\u00adbased detoxification even though they are not Chapter 4 68 seeking substance abuse treatment. Such patients also can be maintained on methadone during the course of hospitalization for any condition other than opioid addiction. The hospital does not have to be a registered opi\u00adoid treatment program, as long as the patient was admitted for a detoxification treatment for some substance other than opioids. On the other hand, some persons may not have used sufficient amounts of opioids to develop withdrawal symptoms, and for others suffi\u00adcient time may have elapsed since their last dose to extinguish withdrawal and eliminate the need for detoxification. Methadone This section discusses methadone as an agent for detoxification. For detailed information on methadone maintenance, readers are referred to TIP 43 Medication\u00adAssisted Treatment for Opioid Addiction in Opioid Treatment Programs (CSAT 2005 d). While methadone is one of the more common medi\u00adcations for opioid detoxification, its use is highly regulated and it can only be prescribed for withdrawal by a doctor at a Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA)\u00adcertified methadone clinic or if the patient is being hospitalized for another medical condition. (Detoxification programs may become certi\u00adfied to prescribe methadone by undergoing the process described in TIP 43.) Federal reg\u00adulations allow for the use of methadone in both a short\u00adterm detoxification treatment of less than 30 days and a long\u00adterm treatment of 30 to 180 days. The regulations also specify that if a patient has failed two detoxification attempts in a 12\u00admonth period he or she must be evaluated for a different course of treat\u00adment (e.g., ongoing opioid substitution therapy). Methadone is a long\u00adacting agonist at the :\u00adopi\u00ad oid receptor site that, in effect, displaces hero\u00ad in (or other abused opioids) and restabilizes the site, thereby reversing opioid withdrawal symp\u00ad toms. If maintained for long enough, this stabi\u00ad lizing effect can even reverse the immunologic and endocrinologic defects caused by long\u00adterm heroin addiction. This is one of many impor\u00ad tant reasons to consider conversion to mainte\u00ad nance during most methadone detoxification admissions. Once the dose requirement for methadone has been established, methadone can be given once daily and generally tapered over 3 to 5 days in 5 to 10mg daily reductions. The initial dose requirement is determined by estimating the amount of opioid use and gauging the patient's response to administered methadone. Clinicians should take care not to underdose patients with methadone; adequate dosage is vitally important. Patients some\u00adtimes exaggerate their daily consumption to receive greater dosages of methadone. For this reason, history is no substitute for a physical examination that screens for signs of opioid withdrawal. Treating clinicians should not only be familiar with the intoxication and withdrawal signs that are set forth in Figure 4\u00ad4 (p. 67), but also should be skilled in dis\u00adcerning these features of opioid withdrawal. Avoidance of overmedicating is crucial during methadone detoxification because excessive doses of this agent can produce overdose, whereas opioid withdrawal does not constitute a medical danger in otherwise healthy adults. For more information on methadone and other medications used to treat opioid addic\u00adtion, see TIP 43, Medication\u00adAssisted Treatment for Opioid Addiction in Opioid Treatment Programs (CSAT 2005 d). Patients with significant opioid dependence may require a starting dose of 30 to 40mg per day; this dose range should be adequate for even the most severe withdrawal. If the degree of dependence is unclear, withdrawal signs and symptoms can be reassessed 1 to 2 hours after giving a dose of 10mg of methadone. The practice of giving a dose of methadone and later assessing its effect (also termed a challenge dose) is an important intervention of detoxification. Sedation or intoxication signs after a methadone challenge dose indicate a lower starting dose. Similarly, intoxication at any point of the detoxification Physical Detoxification Services for Withdrawal From Specific Substances 69 signals the need to hold or more rapidly wean (reduce to a zero dose) the methadone. Care should be taken to avoid giving methadone to newly admitted patients with signs of opioid intoxication, since overdose could result. Note that methadone stabilization is the treat\u00adment of choice for patients who are pregnant and opioid dependent. Clonidine (Catapres) Clonidine was originally marketed and approved for the treatment of high blood pres\u00ad sure but also has been used for opioid detoxifi\u00ad cation since 1978. While clonidine is not FDA approved for treatment of opioid withdrawal, it is widely used \" off label\" for this purpose (Alling 1992) because the research literature substantiates its effectiveness for this condition. Advantages of clonidine over methadone in the treatment of opioid withdrawal are as follows: C lonidine does not produce opioid intoxica\u00ad tion and is not reinforcing. The FDA does not classify clonidine as having abuse potential. Yet some abuse has been reported. (See p. 107 under the section on pregnant women and opioids.) Since clonidine does not interact with the :\u00adopioid receptor, detoxification occurs without opioids. No special licensing is required for the dis\u00ad pensing of this medication. One disadvantage to methadone detoxification with naltrexone (an opioid antagonist), com\u00ad pared with clonidine, is that naltrexone, when it is prescribed for abstinence, can precipitate opioid withdrawal if given too soon after the last methadone dose. This problem does not exist with clonidine, making this agent particu\u00ad larly beneficial in a drug\u00adfree treatment pro\u00ad gram or a therapeutic community. Nevertheless, patients addicted to opioids generally prefer methadone over clonidine detoxification. Although clonidine alleviates some symptoms of opioid withdrawal, it usu\u00adally is relatively ineffective for insomnia, muscle aches, and drug craving. Completion rates for opioid detoxification using clonidine have been low (ranging from 20 to 40 per\u00adcent); those patients who complete the proce\u00addure are more likely to be dependent on opi\u00adoids other than heroin, have private health insurance, and report lower levels of subjec\u00adtive withdrawal symptoms than those who do not complete (Strobbe et al. 2003). An appropriate protocol for clonidine is 0.1mg administered orally as a test dose. A dose of 0.2mg might be used initially for patients with severe signs of opioid withdraw\u00adal or for those patients weighing more than 200 pounds. The sublingual (under the tongue) route of administration also may be used. Clinicians should check the patient's blood pressure prior to clonidine administra\u00adtion and clonidine should be withheld if sys\u00adtolic blood pressure is lower than 90 or dias\u00adtolic blood pressure is below 60. These parameters can be relaxed to 80/50 in some cases if the patient continues to complain of withdrawal and is not experiencing symptoms of orthostatic hypotension (a sudden drop in blood pressure caused by standing). Clonidine (0.1 to 0.2mg orally) can then be given every 4 to 6 hours on an as\u00adneeded basis. Clonidine detoxification is best con\u00adducted in an inpatient setting, as vital signs and side effects can be monitored more close\u00adly in this environment. In cases of severe withdrawal, a standing dose (given at regular intervals rather than purely \"as needed\") of clonidine might be advantageous (Alling 1992). The daily clonidine requirement is established by tabulating the total amount administered in the first 24 hours, and divid\u00ading this into a three or four times per day dosing schedule. Total clonidine should not exceed 1.2mg the first 24 hours and 2.0mg after that, with doses being held in accor\u00addance with parameters noted above. The standing dose is then weaned over several days. Clonidine must be tapered to avoid rebound hypertensions. The clonidine transdermal (administered through the skin) patch, FDA approved in Chapter 4 70 1986 for the treatment of hypertension (high blood pressure), also is used in opioid detoxi\u00adfication. However, the safety of the patch for treatment of opioid withdrawal has not been sufficiently studied in controlled clinical tri\u00adals. The transdermal route of administration has the disadvantage of continued clonidine action even after the patch has been removed. Blood pressure effects of clonidine can there\u00adfore be prolonged, leading to undesirable and persistent reductions of blood pressure. For this reason, it has been recommended that the patch be used only if the patient's blood pres\u00adsure is monitored regularly (Alling 1992). The clonidine patch is available in three sizes that deliver a total daily oral equivalent clonidine dose of 0.2mg (3.5 cm 2), 0.4mg (7.0 cm2), or 0.6mg (10.5 cm2). The patch supplies clonidine for up to 7 days and one patch application usually is sufficient. The conve\u00adnience of one application allows the clinician to avoid the disruption that multiple dosing might have during rehabilitative program\u00adming. In particular, patients can focus on rehabilitative treatment without being dis\u00adtracted by the need to ask repeatedly for oral clonidine doses. Vital signs should be moni\u00adtored at least four times daily to assess persis\u00adtent signs and symptoms of withdrawal or undesirable effects of clonidine on blood pres\u00adsure. Buprenorphine Buprenorphine, a partial a\u00adopioid agonist that is FDA approved in an injectable form (Buprenex) for the treatment of pain, has recently been approved as a detoxification agent and for opioid maintenance treatment as an alternative to methadone maintenance. A number of clinical trials have reported it to be effective for heroin detoxification (Becker et al. 2001; Bickel et al. 1988; Diamant et al. 1998), and the medication should play an important role in gradually removing patients from methadone maintenance (Amass et al. 2004; Banys et al. 1994; Johnson et al. 2000). Buprenorphine is available in oral form as Subutex, which contains only buprenorphine, and is meant for patients who are starting treatment for drug dependence. Another form, Suboxone, contains buprenorphine and naloxone and is intended for persons depen\u00addent on opioids who have already started and are continuing medication therapy. Buprenorphine has great affinity for the :\u00adopioid receptor, in spite of being only a partial agonist, and can displace other One advantage of buprenorphine is that it can be dispensed at a physician's office, unlike methadone, which can be dispensed only at designated treat\u00ad ment centers. opioids such as hero\u00adin. This feature gives buprenorphine the ability to precipitate opioid withdrawal when administered to patients who have recently used heroin (Kosten and McCance\u00adKatz 1995). An advantage to buprenorphine is its safety. Because of the partial agonist action, buprenor\u00adphine has a \"ceiling effect\" with regard to overdose potential (Walsh et al. 1994). That is, unlike methadone, which produces increasing respiratory suppression with increasing dose, respiratory effects of buprenorphine tend to level off due to its partial agonist action. Another advantage of buprenorphine is that it can be dispensed at a physician's office, unlike methadone, which can be dispensed only at designated treatment centers. This makes access to this medication for opioid dependence much more convenient for both patient and clinician. See TIP 40, Clinical Guidelines for the Use of Buprenorphine in the Treatment of Opioid Addiction (CSAT 2004a). Physical Detoxification Services for Withdrawal From Specific Substances 71 Unlike methadone, buprenorphine may be prescribed by physicians who are not con\u00adnected with a certified opioid treatment pro\u00adgram. However, there is a still a specific training and certifi\u00ad cation process physicians must undergo in order to prescribe the medi\u00adcation. Information on the legal aspects of prescribing buprenorphine and rules for carrying out detoxification in the physician's office can be found at http:// www.buprenor\u00ad phine.samhsa.gov/. Information given at the site includes the following on the Drug Addiction Treatment Act (DATA) of 2000: \" [DATA 2000] expands the clinical context of medica\u00adInpatient treatment can provide additional support, medical supervision, and rehabilitative treatment that serve as disincentives to relapse. tion\u00adassisted opioid addiction treatment by allowing qualified physicians to dispense or prescribe specifically approved Schedule III, IV, and V narcotic medications for the treat\u00ad ment of opioid addiction in treatment settings other than the traditional Opioid Treatment Program (i.e., methadone clinic). In addition, DATA 2000 reduces the regulatory burden on physicians who choose to practice opioid addic\u00ad tion therapy by permitting qualified physicians to apply for and receive waivers of the special registration requirements defined in the Controlled Substances Act\" ( SAMHSA 2002). Terminating Methadone Maintenance Treatment Individuals seeking the discontinuation of methadone maintenance require a much more lengthy detoxification process than that described above for heroin. The methadone dose should be tapered gradually by 5 to 10mg/week until a daily dose of 30 to 40mg has been attained. At that time, detoxification with either clonidine or smaller doses of methadone can be instituted. The use of clonidine has the advantage of brevity as a complete clonidine detoxification usually can be conducted within 2 to 3 weeks (Gold et al. 1984). Once the daily dose requirement has been established by using the principles outlined above, the patient can be placed on a stand\u00ading dose of clonidine. The dose required usu\u00adally is in the range of 0.2mg, three to four times daily, although titration (adjustment of dosage in light of drug response) is necessary based on the information gathered during the clinical examination. Additional doses as needed (sometimes abbreviated \"PRN\") of 0.2mg clonidine also can be given and blood pressure parameters must be followed prior to the administration of standing and PRN doses to avoid orthostatic hypotension. The initial standing dose can be reduced to 0.1mg, given three to four times daily, after one week of detoxification, with PRN doses of 0.1mg available. After a period of 1 week on this reduced dosage, clonidine is given for an additional week only if needed. Because cloni\u00addine does not reverse all opioid withdrawal symptoms, especially insomnia, adjunctive medications for symptom relief of insomnia, nausea, diarrhea, etc. usually are required. Clonidine detoxification is best conducted on an inpatient basis to ensure appropriate vital sign monitoring. Inpatient treatment also reduces the impulse to relapse, especially if the detoxification is difficult. Methadone detoxification can be continued once a daily dose of 30 to 40mg is achieved, as described above. The dose can be reduced to 20mg per day by a reduction of 5 to 10mg/week. Once the patient is on 20mg/day, methadone can be reduced by 1 to 2mg daily, depending on clinical measures of withdraw\u00adal. As with clonidine detoxification, the final 2 to 3 weeks of methadone detoxification is associated with recidivism (relapsing). Chapter 4 72 Inpatient treatment, if available, can provide additional support, medical supervision, and rehabilitative treatment that serve as disin\u00adcentives to relapse. Rapid and Ultrarapid Detoxification Although there are few data showing that the rapid or ultrarapid methods of opioid detoxifi\u00ad cation show a positive correlation with the like\u00ad lihood of a patient's being abstinent a few months later, efforts persist to make the detoxi\u00ad fication process shorter and easier. This stems in part from the desire of the person addicted to opioids for a rapid, painless procedure, and in part from an attempt to coax more such per\u00ad sons into treatment (fewer than one in five peo\u00ad ple with substance use disorders in the United States are in treatment at any time) (Office of National Drug Control Policy 2002). Another contributing factor is the American culture's search for rapidity in most endeavors. Finally, the desire for rapid opioid detoxification is a remnant of the belief system of a century ago, when detoxification often was erroneously equated with cure. Rapid methods of detoxification have at their core the use of narcotic antagonists; for exam\u00ad ple, naloxone, withdrawal by displacing exogenous opioids (those not produced by the body itself) from the receptor sites. The ensu\u00ad ing severe symptoms then are managed by a variety of medications and techniques. This procedure was tried in the mid\u00ad1970s (Blachly et al. 1975; Resnick et al. 1977), using naloxone combined with benzodiazepines or propranolol to ameliorate symptoms, but relief was insuffi\u00ad cient for the technique to be considered useful. With the discovery of clonidine as a nonopi\u00adoid that could successfully treat much of the withdrawal syndrome (Gold et al. 1978), the method became more successful, but was still problematic. Using combinations of clonidine, naltrexone, benzodiazepines, and other adjunct medications, the method was refined and shortened during the 1980s (Charney et al. 1982, 1986; Kleber et al. 1987; Riordan and Kleber 1980; Vining et al. 1988) so that a blocking dose of naltrexone\u2014at least 25mg\u2014 usually was used by the second or third day of treatment. The rate\u00adlimiting factor of this rapid clonidine\u00adnaltrexone method is its capacity to adequately relieve the precipitat\u00aded withdrawal symptoms in the conscious patient. Golden and Sakhrani (2004) found that 25 percent of the 20 patients they studied who were undergoing rapid detoxification using clonidine and naltrexone developed delirium and had to discontinue the proce\u00addure after the first day, and another patient dropped out before completion. The 1990s witnessed a variety of attempts to overcome this barrier by using general anes\u00adthesia or heavy sedation. Although the ultra\u00adrapid procedure under anesthesia has received wide publicity, controlled studies that would make it possible to evaluate the risk/benefit ratio are absent. The procedure is still unproven and controversial. For a brief review of studies done in this area, see Stine and colleagues (2003). Patient Care and Comfort Opioid detoxification, when properly conduct\u00ad ed, usually can be concluded without signifi\u00ad cant patient discomfort. Aside from the com\u00ad passionate goal of preventing unnecessary suf\u00ad fering, appropriate opioid detoxification strengthens the therapeutic alliance between the patient and clinician and prevents patients from leaving treatment prematurely. Discomfort also can indicate that too low a dose of the detoxification agent is being adminis\u00ad tered. Mere symptomatic treatment is not a substitute for reversing opioid withdrawal and care should be taken to avoid masking symptoms that would better respond to detoxification. Nevertheless, patients receiving adequate detoxification doses still may complain of symptoms that can be treated with adjunctive Physical Detoxification Services for Withdrawal From Specific Substances 73 medications. Insomnia can be treated with diphenhydramine (Benadryl) 50 to 100mg, trazodone 50mg at bedtime. Benzodiazepines should be avoided unless required for concomitant alcohol or sedative detoxification. Headache, muscle aches, and bone pain can be managed with acetamin\u00adophen (e.g., Tylenol), aspirin, or ibuprofen (e.g., Motrin) as needed. Abdominal cramps are rare when the detoxification dose is suffi\u00adcient but can be ameliorated with dicyclomine (e.g., Bentyl) 10 to 20mg every 6 hours. Mylanta or Maalox can be administered for epigastric complaints and bismuth subcar\u00adbonate (e.g., Pepto\u00adBismol) 30 cc can be given every 2 to 3 hours for diarrhea. Constipation, a frequent complaint during methadone main\u00adtenance, usually can be managed with milk of magnesia at 30 cc daily. Opioid dependence, particularly intravenous heroin dependence, is associated with a num\u00adber of medical conditions. For this reason, a complete physical examination, review of sys\u00adtems, and laboratory evaluation (when indi\u00adcated) should be conducted. The patient should be screened for tuberculosis as well as for commonly encountered medical complica\u00adtions. These include HIV/AIDS, viral hepati\u00adtis (especially B and C), other sexually trans\u00admitted diseases, and opportunistic infections. Injection sites should be examined for infec\u00adtion or abscess and patients should be queried about night sweats, chills, nutritional intake, diarrhea and gastrointestinal distress, fever, and cough. History or evidence of trau\u00adma also should be elicited as part of a com\u00adprehensive assessment upon which a full treatment plan will be based. In general, patients should be ambulatory and able to participate in rehabilitative activities during detoxification. However, during the first 24 hours they may require bed rest or reduced activity. Benzodiazepines and Other Sedative\u00adHypnotics Intoxication and Withdrawal Symptoms Associated With Benzodiazepines and Other Sedative\u00adHypnotics Patients intoxicated with sedative\u00adhypnotics appear similar to individuals intoxicated with alcohol. Slurred speech, ataxia, and poor phys\u00ad ical coordination are prominent. If benzodi\u00ad azepines are used alone, breath and blood alco\u00ad hol levels should be zero. It should be remem\u00ad bered that benzodiazepines, when ingested alone, intentionally, or accidentally in over\u00ad dose, rarely lead to death by themselves. Unfortunately, most individuals who ingest benzodiazepines also may be using alcohol, other sedative\u00adhypnotics, or other drugs of abuse, which in combination with benzodi\u00ad azepines could be fatal if not managed appro\u00ad priately. Management of benzodiazepines and other sedative\u00adhypnotics in overdose is in part sup\u00adported following principles of ACLS with par\u00adticular attention to ventilation. Additionally, removal of the benzodiazepine from the gas\u00adtrointestinal tract using lavage and a cathar\u00adtic is generally carried out, particularly if the overdose is recent. Flumazenil (Romazicon) is a competitive antagonist that acts at the ben\u00adzodiazepine receptor. It can reverse the seda\u00adtive and overdose effects of benzodiazepines but not of alcohol or other sedative\u00adhyp\u00adnotics. The medication is administered via IV by slow push (2 to 3 minutes) and dosage varies, depending on whether one is treating sedation reversal or overdose coma\u00adreversal. Flumazenil is only effective in benzodiazepine overdose and is not an effective antidote against other drugs. Clinicians should be aware that in chronic benzodiazepine users who are physically dependent, flumazenil may induce seizures, high blood pressure, Chapter 4 74 and delirium. So patients who are comatose from benzodiazepines and are benzodiazepine dependent may move quickly from coma to acute benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms when flumazenil is administered. Assessing the potential or actual severity of a benzodiazepine and other sedative\u00adhypnotic abstinence syndrome is based primarily on clinical information obtained from the patient, significant others, and physical assessment. Confirmation of length of benzodiazepine treat\u00ad ment with significant others, local pharmacies, and treating physicians is useful. Specific name of medication, dose, and duration of therapy are vital. The presence or absence of alcohol use is also important to know, as with the use of other sedative\u00adhypnotics, such as medications for sleep. The existence of co\u00adoccurring psychi\u00ad atric disorders such as panic disorder also are important factors and should be investigated. Cigarette smoking tends to induce the metabolism of some benzodiazepines and this can be a factor in scheduling a taper. Physical assessment, with particular attention to mental status, and neurologic exams are important. Determination of vital signs also provides guid\u00ad ance. A urine drug screen may confirm the presence of benzodiazepines but otherwise will not be particularly helpful. Although sedative\u00ad hypnotic withdrawal scales have been used in research studies, they are not widely available for clinical practice. Medical complications of withdrawal from ben\u00ad zodiazepines include problems similar to those seen in alcohol withdrawal. Seizures are partic\u00ad ularly worrisome and may occur without being preceded by other evidence of withdrawal. As in alcohol withdrawal, seizures and delirium represent the most extreme pathology seen. Anecdotal reports appearing in the literature also have described distortions in taste, smell, and other perceptions. Since many individuals who take benzodiazepines have underlying anxiety disorders, it often is difficult during periods of withdrawal to determine whether symptomatology is related to withdrawal or the emergence of panic attack symptoms. Elderly patients who are being withdrawn from benzo\u00addiazepine are at risk for falls and myocardial infarctions. Delirium without marked auto\u00ad nomic hyperactivity (no elevations of pulse, blood pressure, or temperature) also may be seen in the elderly. The management of benzo\u00ad diazepine withdrawal is not recommended without medical supervision. All benzodi\u00ad azepines should be tapered rather than stopped abruptly, regardless of dose or duration of use\u2014unless it is a matter of use for only a few days (Ashton 2002). Patients intoxicated with sedative\u00adhypnotics appear similar to individuals intoxicated with alcohol. Slurred speech, ataxia, and poor physical coordination are prominent. Management of Withdrawal With Medications There are a limited number of controlled trials that can pro\u00ad vide guidance regard\u00ad ing the management of benzodiazepine and other sedative\u00ad hypnotic withdrawal. For reviews, see Rickels and col\u00ad leagues (1999) and Eickelberg and Mayo\u00ad Smith (1998). One strategy that is appro\u00ad priate is to begin with a slow taper of the benzodiazepine that the patient already is tak\u00ad ing. This taper may be conducted over several weeks or perhaps even months. This may be effective in cases of long\u00adacting benzodiazepines but often is not effective in detoxification from short half\u00adlife benzodiazepines. Sometimes switching to another benzodiazepine in a patient who has had serious loss of control and abuse problems with his primary agent is ther\u00ad apeutic. Another strategy is to switch the patient to another benzodiazepine with a long half\u00adlife. Frequently chlorodiazepoxide and Physical Detoxification Services for Withdrawal From Specific Substances 75 clonazepam are recommended. Figures 4\u00ad5 and 4\u00ad6 (p. 78) give the equivalent doses of these medicines along with numerous other sedative\u00ad hypnotics and benzodiazepines. Another alternative is phenobarbital substitu\u00ad tion. For patients who have used high doses of benzodiazepines for an extended period of time, hospitalization is always prudent. Outpatient detoxification should be reserved for patients whose doses of benzodiazepines were mainly in therapeutic ranges, who do not have polysubstance dependence, and who are reliable and have reliable significant others to aid in monitoring and supervising their progress. In the outpatient setting, patients and families need to be informed that even with sound withdrawal treatment, seizures and delirium are possible. The individual should be instructed not to drive or operate dangerous machinery during treatment and perhaps for several weeks thereafter. Recurring assessment will be necessary, particularly around times of dosage reductions. Pregnant patients will need to be detoxified slowly and in consultation with an obstetrician. A variety of cognitive and behavioral tech\u00ad niques have been proposed to assist in the pres\u00ad ence of a medication taper. These techniques alter negative cognitions regarding medication cessation, provide patient education, and pro\u00ad vide alternative cognitive and behavioral tech\u00ad niques for anxiety reduction and sleep enhancement during detoxification (Spiegel 1999). Anticonvulsants such as carbamazepine and valproate, as well as sedating antidepressants such as trazodone and imipramine, have been advocated for use in withdrawal (Dickinson et al. 2003). Rickels and colleagues (1999) assert that these drugs have some beneficial effect in the management of relatively low\u00addose benzo\u00ad diazepine discontinuation in their ability to reduce patients' subjective complaints, but that, in more severe withdrawal syndromes, they do not decrease symptoms. Imipramine can lower the seizure threshold and therefore is not recommended. The use of anticonvul\u00adsants is probably best reserved as an adjunc\u00adtive medicine to the long\u00adacting benzodi\u00adazepine or phenobarbital. The use of bus\u00adpirone for benzodiazepine detoxification is ineffective and should not be considered. For patients with major autonomic symptoms dur\u00ading withdrawal that cannot be controlled by the primary treating agent, consideration of the use of a low dose of clonidine or propra\u00adnolol may be helpful. Preparing patients and starting detoxification during a period of low external stressors, with patient commitment to tapering, and a plan to manage underlying anxiety disorders, also are important in detoxification. A flexible detoxi\u00adfication schedule is advised. During periods of increased withdrawal symptoms, dosage should be stabilized or even increased for a period of days. Frequent in\u00adperson or phone contact with the patient is vital. Patients being detoxified in the outpatient setting may need to be seen several times per week, espe\u00adcially at times of dosage reductions. Stimulants Cocaine and amphetamines (such as metham\u00ad phetamine) are the most frequently abused cen\u00ad tral nervous system stimulants. These agents are intensely rewarding and are self\u00adadminis\u00ad tered by laboratory animals to the point of death. Individuals dependent on stimulants experience profound loss of control over stimu\u00ad lant intake, presumably in response to the stimulation and disruption of endogenous (orig\u00ad inating internally) reward centers (Dackis and O'Brien 2001). They often use stimulants in a binge pattern that is followed by periods of withdrawal. It is not clear whether craving occurs predominantly during stimulant with\u00ad Chapter 4 76 Figure 4\u00ad5 Benzodiazepines and Their Phenobarbital Withdrawal Equivalents Generic name Trade name Therapeutic dose range (mg/day) Dose equal to 30mg of 0.125-0.50* 0.25 120 * Usual hypnotic dose. ** Phenobarbital withdrawal conversion equivalence is not the same as therapeutic dose equivalency.

While the processes that govern addiction to cocaine and amphetamines are believed to be similar, recent animal research suggests that there are also subtle differences in the ways in which these two types of drugs cre\u00ad ate sensitization (and perhaps addiction) in reg\u00ad ular users (Li et al. 2005). Stimulant Withdrawal Symptoms Stimulants are associated with withdrawal symptoms that differ markedly from those seen with opioid, alcohol, and sedative dependence (see Figure 4\u00ad7). While most clinicians believe that alcohol and heroin withdrawal should be treated aggressively with detoxification, there has been little emphasis on treating symptoms of stimulant withdrawal. Consequently, no medications have been developed for this pur\u00ad pose. This situation is understandable because stimulant withdrawal usually does not involve medical danger or intense patient discomfort. However, if stimulant withdrawal predicts poor outcome, it may be a reasonable target for clin\u00ad ical interventions. An often overlooked but potentially lethal \" medical danger\" during stimulant withdrawal is the risk of a profound dysphoria (depres\u00ad sion, negative thoughts and feelings) that may include suicidal ideas or attempts. This may be, in part, a physiological response to cocaine o r amphetamine withdrawal and, in part, a reaction to individuals' acute realization of the devastating psychosocial consequences after a binge ends. While both cocaine and amphetamine users may experience depression during withdrawal, the period of depression experienced by amphetamine users is more prolonged and may be more intense. Amphetamine users, in particular, should be monitored closely during detoxification for signs of suicidality and treated for depression if appropriate. Although the literature on cocaine withdrawal is controversial, reasonable consensus supports the constellation of symptoms depicted in Figure 4\u00ad7 (Coffey et al. 2000; Cottler et al. 1993). These symptoms often disappear after several days of stimulant abstinence but can persist for 3 to 4 weeks (Coffey et al. 2000). In addition, since individuals addicted to stimu\u00ad lants often fail to achieve abstinence, withdraw\u00ad al symptoms can be a persistent component of active addiction. In addition, individuals addicted to stimulants may experience impair\u00ad ment in hedonic function (ability to experience pleasure) that has been ascribed to stimulant\u00ad induced disruptions of endogenous reward cen\u00ad ters (Dackis and O'Brien 2002). Research on animals has found that exposure to high doses of methamphetamine results in changes to both the dopaminergic and serotonergic systems of the brain (Nordahl et al. 2005) and dopamine abnormalities among animals and humans who had been ingesting cocaine (Schuckit 2000). Figure 4\u00ad7 Stimulant Withdrawal Symptoms Depresion Hypersomnia (or insomnia) Fatigue Anxiety Irritability Poor concentration Psychomotor retardation Increased appetite Paranoia Drug craving Source: Consensus Panelist Robert Malcolm, M.D. Physical Detoxification Services for Withdrawal From Specific Substances 79 Researchers have also observed abnormalities in regions of the brain that govern attention and memory in animals that were regularly administered methamphetamine (Nordahl et al. 2005). Although cocaine withdrawal has traditionally been viewed as relatively mild (Satel et al. 1991; Weddington et al. 1990), evidence sug\u00ad gests that individuals dependent on cocaine with severe stimulant withdrawal are more like\u00ad ly to have a poor clinical outcome (Kampman et al. 2001a). The level of withdrawal symp\u00ad toms, therefore, may be clinically significant and should be monitored and recorded for future treatment (Kampman et al. 2001b). Kampman reported significantly higher dropout rates in individuals dependent on cocaine who scored high on the Cocaine Selective Severity Assessment (CSSA), a reli\u00ad able and valid structured interview designed to capture cocaine withdrawal symptoms (Kampman et al. 1998). Patients with high scores on the CSSA were five times more likely to leave treatment and four times more likely to resume cocaine use than those with low scores (Mulvaney et al. 1999). The CSSA is an easily administered 18\u00aditem questionnaire. Each item is a 7\u00adpoint rating scale, so that a person can score a number of points on any given ques\u00ad tion. Scores in excess of 22 indicate the pres\u00ad ence of significant cocaine withdrawal. See appendix C for more information on the CSSA. Given the poor prognosis associated with cocaine withdrawal, it is reasonable that more clinical attention be directed toward this phe\u00ad nomenon. Medical Complications of Stimulant Withdrawal As previously noted, stimulant withdrawal is not usually associated with medical complica\u00ad tions. However, patients with recent cocaine use can experience persistent cardiac complica\u00ad tions, including prolonged QTc interval and vulnerability myocardial infarction (Chakko and Myerburg 1995). QT is an interval of time that can be measured on an electrocardiogram (between the q wave and the t wave), while QTc is the relative (or \" correct\u00ad ed\") QT interval. Some conditions and many drugs (LAAM, other opioids, and even antibi\u00ad otics) can cause the interval to lengthen and this can result in cardiac rhythm disturbances. Anterior chest pain or cardiac symptoms should therefore be fully evaluated in these individuals. Seizures also may be a complica\u00ad tion of stimulant abuse and can occur during detoxification. Persistent headaches could rep\u00ad resent a subdural, subarachnoid, or intracere\u00ad bral bleed (bleeding in or around the brain) and should be appropriately evaluated. It also should be emphasized that people who abuse stimulants usually become addicted to other substances, such as alcohol, sedatives, or opi\u00ad oids, and therefore can experience any of the complications ascribed to detoxification from these substances. Covert (secretive) use of other substances should be suspected and assessed with urine toxicology. Management of Withdrawal Without Medications The most effective means of treating stimulant withdrawal involves establishing a period of abstinence from these agents. Access to brief hospitalization, a level of care previously avail\u00ad able for those who abuse stimulants, has been largely eliminated by managed care initiatives. In its place, intensive outpatient treatment can assist the patient to cease use long enough for withdrawal symptoms to abate entirely. Rehabilitative approaches to achieve stimulant abstinence have been reviewed elsewhere (Dackis and O'Brien 2001). The avoidance of cue\u00adinduced craving is particularly important in these individuals, especially in light of research that shows limbic activation (activity in a certain part of the brain) in response to cue\u00adinduced craving (Childress et al. 1999). It also is important that individuals dependent on stimulants abstain from other addictive sub\u00ad stances. Chapter 4 80 Management of Withdrawal With Medications There are no medications with proven efficacy to treat stimulant withdrawal. However, researchers have investigated some medications for cocaine detoxification. Amantadine may help reduce cocaine use in patients with more severe withdrawal symptoms (Kampman et al. 2000). Modafinil, an antinarcolepsy agent with stimulant\u00adlike action, is currently under inves\u00ad tigation by one research group as a cocaine detoxification agent (Dackis and O'Brien 2002). One small study in Thailand found the antidepressant mirtazapine (Remeron) was effective at reducing a number of the symptoms associated with amphetamine withdrawal (Kongsakon et al. 2005). None of these medica\u00ad tions, however, are approved for use in treating stimulant withdrawal and further research is needed. Gorelick and colleagues (2004) review the full range of clinical literature on pharma\u00ad cological intervention for cocaine addiction. Patient Care and Comfort Since stimulant withdrawal is not associated with severe physical symptoms, adjunctive medications are seldom required. These patients often are sleep deprived and might be unable to benefit from therapeutic activities during the first 24 to 36 hours of abstinence. They often are hungry and in need of large meal portions initially as their food intake may have been inadequate during active addiction. Stimulant users also may be irritable and care should be taken to avoid needless confrontation during the initial withdrawal phase. Headaches often are reported and can be treated symp\u00ad tomatically. Persistent headaches should be evaluated, as cocaine can produce cerebrovas\u00ad cular disease. Similarly, chest pain of possible cardiac origin should be evaluated medically with electrocardiography, cardiac enzymes, and appropriate medical attention. On occa\u00ad sion, patients undergoing withdrawal from cocaine or amphetamines report insomnia and may benefit from diphenhydramine (Benadryl) 50 100mg, trazodone 50mg at bed\u00ad time. Benzodiazepines should be avoided unless required for concomitant alcohol or sedative detoxification. As stimulant withdrawal symp\u00ad toms wane, patients are best treated with an active rehabilitative approach that combines entry into substance abuse treatment with sup\u00ad port, education, and changes in lifestyle. Other Immediate Concerns Central nervous system stimulants exert most of their toxic effects through vasoconstriction (constriction of the blood vessels). Consequently, a number of medical conditions can arise from ischemia (lack of proper blood supply) Intensive outpatient treatment can assist the patient to cease use long enough for withdrawal symptoms to abate entirely. or infarction (death of tissue as the result of lack of blood sup\u00ad ply) as a result of stimulant use. Myocardial (heart muscle) infarction and stroke are widely recognized complica\u00ad tions of stimulant use. However, other prob\u00ad lems such as sponta\u00ad neous abortion, bowel necrosis (tissue death), and renal (kidney) infarction also have been reported from cocaine\u00adinduced vaso\u00ad constriction. Cardiac arrhythmias also are common. Other medical problems that are associated with stimulant dependence include dental disease, neuropsy\u00ad chiatric abnormalities, and movement distur\u00ad bances/disorders. Antidepressants, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, can be prescribed for the depression that often accompanies metham\u00ad phetamine or other amphetamine withdrawal. Physical Detoxification Services for Withdrawal From Specific Substances 81 Inhalants/Solvents Withdrawal Symptoms Associated With Inhalants/Solvents The term \"inhalants\" is used to describe a large and varied group of psychoactive sub\u00ad stances that all share the common characteris\u00ad tic of being inhaled for their effects. They are commonly found in household, industrial, and medical products. These drugs are used pri\u00ad marily by adolescents, although some, especial\u00ad ly the nitrates, are used by adults as well (NIDA 2000). Figure 4\u00ad8 presents some of the more commonly abused inhalants. Dependence on inhalants and subsequent withdrawal symptoms are both relatively uncommon phenomena (Balster 2003). There is no specific or characteristic withdrawal syndrome that would include all drugs in the inhalant class. Intoxication with the solvents, aerosols, and gases often produces a syn\u00addrome most like that of alcohol intoxication but lasting only 15 to 45 minutes (Miller and Gold 1990). Rarely, symptoms similar to sedative withdrawal have been described, including \"fine tremors, irritability, anxiety, insomnia, tingling sensations, seizures and muscle cramps\" (Miller and Gold 1990, p. 87). Toluene withdrawal has been reported to cause delirium tremens (Miller and Gold 1990). Longtime users also may exhibit weak\u00adness, weight loss, inattentive behavior, and depression (NIDA 2005). It has been reported that withdrawal symptoms can occur with as little as 3 months of regular usage (Ron 1986). When present, the withdrawal typically lasts 2 to 5 days (Evans and Raistrick 1987). In addition to their short\u00adterm intoxicating affects, nitrates are used to enhance sexual pleasure by vasodilation (dilation of blood vessels) that produces a rush and sensation of warmth. There is no withdrawal syndrome that has been associated with nitrate abuse. There are no specific assessment instruments available to measure inhalant withdrawal symptoms. A patient who presents with a his\u00adtory of inhalant use and symptoms of seda\u00adtive\u00adlike withdrawal should alert the clinician to the possibility of inhalant withdrawal. These patients require a complete history and physical exam. Additionally, a blood alcohol level and urine drug screen are helpful in the cases of suspected polydrug abuse. Medical Complications of Withdrawal From Inhalants/Solvents There are a large number of medical complica\u00ad tions associated with inhalant abuse and intoxi\u00ad cation. Many of these complications are not the result of withdrawal but may still be seen when the patient presents to the clinician. Most inhalants produce some neurotoxicity with cog\u00ad nitive, motor, and sensory involvement. Additionally, damage to internal organs includ\u00ad ing the heart, lungs, kidneys, liver, pancreas, and bone marrow has been reported. Management of Withdrawal Without Medications It is crucial to provide the patient with an envi\u00ad ronment of safety that removes him from access to inhalants. This can pose a challenge due to the almost universal availability of these drugs in society. Many of the medical consequences of inhalant usage will remit once the patient achieves abstinence (Balster 2003). The patient should be monitored for withdrawal symptoms and changes in mental status. Most patients presenting for treatment of inhalant dependence will be adolescents. Ideally, they should be entered into an age\u00ad appropriate treatment program that meets their medical and psychosocial needs. Supportive care, including helping them to get enough sleep and a well\u00adbalanced diet, usually will be sufficient to get patients safely through withdrawal (Frances and Miller 1998).

Clinicians should prompt\u00ad ly ascertain if the patient has been abusing any other substances and proceed with appropriate detoxification as clinically indicated. When a patient presents with (1) a history of extensive inhalant usage, (2) a sedative\u00adlike withdrawal syndrome, and (3) no significant history or lab\u00ad oratory data that supports other substances, then the clinician can assume that the patient is in inhalant withdrawal. As noted before, withdrawal from inhalants is similar to withdrawal from sedative\u00adhyp\u00adnotics. No systematic detoxification protocol has been established, although some clinicians have found phenobarbital useful (CSAT 1995 d). The usefulness of benzodiazepines is unknown but would seem a reasonable alter\u00adnative given our current understanding of inhalant withdrawal (Brouette and Anton 2001). No other medications have been rou\u00adtinely used for inhalant withdrawal. Patient Care and Comfort For patients who have only been abusing inhalants, treatment of insomnia during with\u00addrawal is not usually necessary. Sedative sub\u00adstitution during the period of detoxification may allow the patient to sleep. However, a period of postdetoxification insomnia should be expected and usually can be treated by the Physical Detoxification Services for Withdrawal From Specific Substances 83 Figure 4\u00ad8 (continued) Commonly Abused Inhalants/Solvents Solvents and gases Nail polish remover Acetone, ethyl acetate Paint remover Toluene, methylene ethyl acetate Paint thinner distillates, esters, acetone Correction fluid and thinner Trichloroethylene, trichloroethane Fuel gas Butane, isopropane Lighter Butane, isopropane Fire Bromochlorodifluoromethane Food Nitrous recommendation of good sleep hygiene prac\u00ad tices such as avoiding caffeine, daytime nap\u00ad ping, and overstimulation in the evening. If the patient is able to refrain from inhalant (and other substance) use and has no serious psychiatric or medical consequences, then outpatient treatment should be the first option. Inpatient or residential treatment should be used for those patients who cannot achieve abstinence or have serious co\u00adoccur\u00ad ring medical or psychiatric disorders. Hospitalized patients will need a thorough history and physical exam. Therapy to address denial, addiction, and pertinent psy\u00ad chosocial issues should be initiated as soon as possible during the hospitalization. Supportive care and abstinence will resolve most medical problems associated with chron\u00ad ic inhalant usage (Balster 2003). Nicotine In 2004, approximately 44.5 million adults were cigarette smokers (23.4 percent were men and 18.5 percent were women) (CDC 2005 a). Nicotine addiction in the form of cigarette smoking accounts for more deaths each year than AIDS, alcohol, cocaine, hero\u00adin, homicide, suicide, motor vehicle crashes, and fires combined (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services [U.S. HHS] 2000 b). Between 1995 and 1999, there were 490,000 smoking\u00adrelated premature deaths annually, and smoking cost the country at least $157 billion yearly in health\u00adrelated eco\u00adnomic losses. This amounts to approximately $7.18 per pack of cigarettes (Fellows et al. 2002), a truly staggering figure. Smokers are at increased risk for several medical problems, including myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease, hyperten\u00adsion, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, Chapter 4 84 chronic obstructive lung disease, chronic bronchitis, and several types of cancer (lung, stomach, head and neck, and bladder). Other problems associated with nicotine addiction include gastro\u00adesophageal reflux disease and gastric ulcerations, cataracts, and premature wrinkling of the skin. There also appears to be an antiestrogen effect (suppression of an important hormone) that may lead to early development of osteoporosis in women (Okuyemi et al. 2000). In 1988, the U.S. Surgeon General's Report concluded that nicotine is the principal addic\u00adtive agent in tobacco. Nicotine binds to nico\u00adtinic acetylcholine receptors in the brain and has the direct ability to stimulate the release of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens area. The nucleus accumbens has long been consid\u00adered the \"reward center\" in the brain. This increase in dopamine is similar to what occurs when patients use stimulants and is felt to be an essential element in the reward process of addiction (Glover and Glover 2001). As many as 90 percent of patients entering treatment for substance abuse are current nicotine users (Perine and Schare 1999). There has long been controversy in the field of addiction medicine as to how best to handle the problem of nicotine dependence in patients seeking treatment for other types of substance abuse. Traditionally, it has been argued that patients would find that trying to stop smoking while also contending with other (more pressing) addiction problems would be too difficult and distracting in early absti\u00adnence. However, others argue that nicotine dependence is a lethal disease and that physi\u00ad cians have the responsibility to intervene in this addiction with the same aggressiveness they show toward other addictive substances. This pro\u00adintervention position has received increasing attention from clinicians, inasmuch as it is now understood that alcohol consump\u00adtion is associated with increased nicotine usage (Henningfield et al. 1984). Gulliver and colleagues (1995) have demonstrated that the urge to smoke is correlated with the urge to drink, and others have shown that continued nicotine dependence may be a relapse trigger for resumption of drinking (Stuyt 1997). The concern that smoking cessation may precipi\u00adtate relapse to other substances of abuse has not been supported in the literature (Hughes 1995). Treatment programs that have attempted to treat nicotine dependence in conjunction with other drugs of addiction have met with limit\u00aded success (Bobo and Davis 1993; Burling et al. 1991; Hurt et al. 1994) and have generat\u00aded increased interest in smoking cessation as a part of a patient's overall substance abuse treatment (Sees and Clark 1993). One study reported that forcing unmotivated patients (or patients who did not consider smoking a problem) to quit was countertherapeutic (Trudeau et al. 1995). Moreover, it has traditionally been accepted that nicotine detoxification concurrent with detoxification from other substances makes the undertaking more difficult. Several fac\u00adtors are involved including the following: (1) patient ambivalence and/or lack of interest in smoking cessation; (2) physician ambivalence about the importance of smoking cessation early in treatment; (3) staff's use of nicotine; (4) staff' s ambivalence about the importance of nicotine cessation early in treatment; (5) easy availability of cigarettes from peers, family, visitors, staff, and at 12\u00adStep meet\u00adings; (6) lack of sufficient training and exper\u00adtise on the part of physicians and staff in managing nicotine withdrawal; and (7) staff resistance to patient smoking cessation because withdrawal symptoms include irri\u00adtability, anxiety, and depression, all of which can make patients more difficult to manage. Withdrawal Symptoms Associated With Nicotine The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, text revision (DSM\u00adIV\u00adTR) (APA 2000) notes that typically, a person in nicotine withdrawal will have four Physical Detoxification Services for Withdrawal From Specific Substances 85 or more of the signs presented in Figure 4\u00ad9, though some clinicians believe that three or more is sufficient to make the diagnosis of nicotine withdrawal. Furthermore, it should be noted that symptoms vary in duration and intensity, with decreased heart rate and light\u00adheadedness resolving in 48 hours, while increased appetite may remain present for weeks to months (Glover and Glover 2001). Smokers who have severe craving during withdrawal are less likely to be successful in their attempt at quitting (Hughes and Hatsukami 1992). Depression during with\u00addrawal also has been linked to relapse to smoking (Covey et al. 1993). Assessing Severity Since 1978, the standard instrument used to measure physical dependence on nicotine has been the eight\u00aditem Fagerstrom Tolerance Questionnaire (FTQ) (Fagerstrom 1978). A later revision known as the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) (see Figure 4\u00ad10) has been reduced to six questions (Giovino et al. 1995; Heatherton et al. 1991). Scores greater than seven are consistent with nicotine dependence. While both the FTQ and FTND are very use\u00ad ful for estimating a patient's physical depen\u00addence on nicotine, there is still a need to assess more accurately the degree to which smoking behavior plays a role in maintaining addiction. The Glover\u00adNilsson Smoking Behavioral Questionnaire (GN\u00adSBQ) is an 11\u00adquestion, self\u00adadministered test that evaluates the impact of behaviors and rituals associated with smoking (see Figure 4\u00ad11, p. 88). It was designed to assist clinicians in identifying and quantifying behavioral aspects of smoking that play a role in maintaining nicotine dependence, which can then help the clinician develop a cessation strategy that takes into account both physical dependence and behav\u00adioral dependence (Glover et al. 2002).

Nicotine and its metabolite cotinine can be measured in urine, blood, or saliva. Cotinine continues to be pre\u00adsent in bodily fluids for up to 7 days after ces\u00adsation. Clinicians should use caution when interpreting the meaning of nicotine and coti\u00ad nine assays, as they are not specific to tobac\u00adco\u00adderived nicotine and may indicate the patient's compliance with nicotine replace\u00ad ment therapy rather than smoking. Carbon monoxide is easily measured in expired breath and can show whether the patient has been smoking within a few hours prior to the test. It can be used to monitor smoking cessation for patients receiving nico\u00adtine replacement therapy and patients often find it a helpful motivator in their attempt to maintain abstinence (Benowitz 1983). Medical Complications of Withdrawal From Nicotine There are no major medical complications pre\u00ad cipitated by nicotine withdrawal itself. However, patients frequently experience uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms starting within a few hours of cessation. In addition to the symptoms previously noted, patients may complain of increased coughing, a desire for sweets, and difficulty concentrating (Hughes and Hatsukami 1992).

Smoking cessation also may affect the metabolism of other drugs primarily through the Cytochrome P 450 (CYP450) system. This system is one of many hepatic liver enzyme sys\u00ad tems that is responsible for the metabolic breakdown of various drugs into inactive com\u00ad pound products. Different drugs and com\u00ad pounds have varying affinities for the CYP450 system. The higher the affinity, the faster the breakdown of the drug or compound in the body. Some compounds can slow the metabolism or breakdown of other drugs with a lower affinity, leading to a buildup of that drug or compound in the body. During detoxification from nicotine, some medications will have their metabolism altered, including tacrine, imipramine, haloperidol, penta\u00adzocine, effects are short\u00adlived and seldom drastic. Nicotine also reduces beta blockers' ability to lower blood pressure and heart rate and decreases the amount of seda\u00adtion from benzodiazepines as well as de\u00adcreases the amount of pain relief provided by some opioids, most likely because of its stimu\u00adlant effects (Zevin and Benowitz 1999). A complete discussion of nicotine's effects on medications is beyond the scope of this TIP and physicians are encouraged to consult the Physicians' Desk Reference (2004) or equiva\u00adlent pharmaceutical guide. Figure 4\u00ad13 (p. 90) shows the effects of abstinence from smoking on blood levels of a number of medications. Management of Withdrawal Without Medications About one third of current smokers attempt to quit smoking each year and more than 90 percent of these try to do so without any for\u00admal nicotine cessation treatment. Most smok\u00aders will make several attempts on their own to quit and ultimately, only about 50 percent are successful over a lifetime (U.S. HHS 2000 b). While some smokers are able to quit on their own, others may require intervention in the form of behavioral treatment and/or pharma\u00adcotherapy. There are insufficient data available to deter\u00ad mine who will benefit most from a particular type of treatment. Some patients may prefer to stop smoking without the use of medica\u00adtion. An elevated score on the GN\u00adSBQ would indicate a strong behavioral component to smoking that might guide the clinician in rec\u00adommending behavioral treatment as a prima\u00adry intervention. Patients who also have ele\u00advated FTQ scores may benefit by a combina\u00adtion of behavioral and pharmaceutical inter\u00advention.

The U.S. Public Health Service' s Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence: Clinical Practice Guideline is a comprehensive review of the smoking cessation literature (Fiore et al. 2000 a). It discusses a range of nonphar\u00ad macological interventions for the management of withdrawal from nicotine; these can be sep\u00adarated into two basic categories: self\u00adhelp interventions and behavioral interventions (Anderson and Wetter 1997). Self\u00adhelp interventions Many tobacco users prefer to attempt to quit without any assistance from professionals. A number of self\u00adhelp products are available that can assist them in their cessation attempts. These include a wide array of pam\u00adphlets, manuals, video\u00ad and audiotapes (e.g., from the American Lung Association and the National Cancer Institute), 12\u00adStep self\u00adhelp support groups, and telephone helplines. The U.S. Public Health Service's Guideline, which analyzed all types of self\u00adhelp interventions together, found that the self\u00adhelp approach to cessation yielded results only slightly better than no intervention at all. To date, self\u00adhelp interventions alone have not been very suc\u00ad cessful at helping people achieve abstinence from tobacco. The Guideline suggests, howev\u00ad er, that self\u00adhelp can be a useful adjunct to other forms of treatment (Fiore et al. 2000 a). One type of self\u00adhelp intervention that shows some promise is the use of computer\u00adgenerat\u00aded personalized written feedback for patients. The computer makes recommendations based on an individual's response to standardized questions about her smoking (Etter and Perneger 2001; Shiffman et al. 2000). Behavioral interventions The U.S. Public Health Service study noted that when physicians took as little as 3 min\u00adutes to advise their patients to stop smoking, long\u00adterm quit rates were modestly improved from 7.9 percent to 10.2 percent (Fiore et al. 2000 a). Westmaas and colleagues note that \"simple, clear advice from a physician can be considered an easy, cost\u00adeffective intervention that not only moves smokers closer to the decision to quit, but also may motivate some smokers to make an actual attempt\" Chapter 4 90 (Westmaas et al. 2000, p. 58). The greater the amount of time in face\u00adto\u00adface interventions, the higher the success rate for patients, but interventions as short as 3 minutes have been found to be effective (Fiore et al. 2000 a). A counseling session of longer than 10 minutes produced a cessation rate of 20.1 percent compared to a rate of 10.9 percent for no treatment. The guideline also indicated that if cessation information is given by multiple types of providers (e.g., physician, psycholo\u00adgist, dentist, nurse, and pharmacist) it can have a dramatic effect on cessation rates, increasing the rate to 23 percent compared to 10.8 percent for patients who had no provider contact. A review of behavioral intervention studies concluded that both supportive care by a clinician and the ability of patients to develop problemsolving and coping skills improved success rates for smoking cessation (Anderson and Wetter 1997) . Other components such as cigarette fading (gradually decreasing the number of cigarettes smoked over a period of time), establishing a quit date, enhanced envi\u00adronmental support, improved diet and increased exercise, relaxation training, and contingency contracting were not associated with improved outcome. Aversive condition\u00ading, such as rapid smoking techniques, is effective but not routinely recommended (Fiore et al. 2000 a). Management of Withdrawal With Medications A U.S. Public Health Service panel recom\u00admends that all primary care physicians pro\u00advide a five\u00adstep intervention, known as the \"5 A's,\" to all tobacco users. The panel recom\u00ad mends that all smokers who want to quit should be offered active medication that has been approved for assisting in smoking cessa\u00adtion unless there is a medical contraindication (Fiore et al. 2000 a). Figure 4\u00ad14 provides a summary of the \"5 A's\" for brief intervention. Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) Nicotine polacrilex gum was approved by the FDA in 1984. In the 1990s other NRTs received FDA approval, including the nicotine transder\u00ad mal patch, the nicotine nasal inhaler. Nicotine gum and nicotine transdermal patch are now available over the counter. After the acute withdrawal period, patients are then weaned off the medication until they become nicotine free. All NRTs are Figure 4\u00ad14 The \"5 A's\" for Brief Intervention Ask about tobacco use. Identify and document tobacco use status for every patient at every visit. Advise to quit. In a clear, strong, and personalized manner urge every tobacco user to quit. Assess willingness to make a quit attempt. Is the tobacco user willing to make a quit attempt at this time? Assist in quit attempt. For the patient willing to make a quit attempt, use counseling and pharmacother\u00ad apy to help him or her quit. Arrange followup. Schedule followup contact, preferably within the first week after the quit date. Source: Fiore et al. 2000 a, p. 26. Physical Detoxification Services for Withdrawal From Specific Substances 91 effective, with 1\u00adyear quit rates between 11 and 34 percent (Okuyemi et al. 2000). There has been some concern about the addictive potential of NRTs, and it has been reported that 5 to 20 percent of patients using nicotine polacrilex gum continue to use it for more than 1 year (Hughes 1989). There was also initial concern that the nicotine nasal spray, with its rapid onset of action and high plasma concentrations, might become a drug of abuse. This has not been reported in the literature, and it could be speculated that this is because of the nasal spray's relatively uncom\u00adfortable side effects that cause many patients to dislike the product (Schuh et al. 1997). In gen\u00aderal, withdrawal symptoms from NRTs are mild com\u00adpared to those that occur in smoking cessation, and con\u00adtinued use of these products may be the result of patients' fear of returning to active smoking (APA 1996). For those patients who continue to use NRTs, providers should balance the patient's continued depen\u00ad dence on nicotine with the considerable health benefit of decreasing active tobacco usage. It is clear that constituents of tobacco other than nicotine are responsible for caus\u00ad ing cancer. No ill effects have been attributed to long\u00adterm use of nicotine replacement ther\u00ad apy (Benowitz and Gourlay 1997). Patients should be encouraged to use combined NRT treatments if they are unable to quit using a single type of first line pharmacotherapy. Bupropion SR Bupropion SR (Sustained Release) was initially manufactured under the name Wellbutrin as a treatment for major depressive disorder. In 1997, the FDA approved bupropion SR for smoking cessation, and it has been marketed under the name Zyban. Bupropion is a novel antidepressant that is involved primarily with dopamine but also affects adrenergic mecha\u00ad nisms in the central nervous system. Its exact mechanism of action is unknown, but it is not a nicotine substitute or replacement like the NRTs. The recommended dose is 150mg daily for 3 days and then 150mg twice daily for 7 to 12 weeks. Typically patients set their quit date 1 to 2 weeks from the time they start the medi\u00ad cation in order to get the drug to therapeutic levels. This is an ideal time for the patient to focus on making behavioral changes and enlist\u00ad ing social support to augment his quit attempt. Bupropion SR has proven useful in smoking cessation with a 12\u00admonth abstinence rate of 35.5 percent compared to a placebo at 15.6 percent and the nicotine patch at 16.4 percent (Westmaas et al. 2000). The most commonly reported side effects include dry mouth and insomnia. Bupropion SR should not be used in patients with a history of seizures, heavy alco\u00ad hol use, head trauma, or with anorexia or bulimia. Other nonnicotine pharmacotherapy Covey and colleagues examined nonnicotine pharmaceutical products that have been evalu\u00ad ated in controlled trials of smoking cessation (Covey et al. 2000). These drugs include the following: The alpha\u00ad2 receptor blocker, mecamylamine Oral dextrose tablets Although none of these agents has been approved by the FDA for smoking cessation, clonidine, nortriptyline, and moclobemide have all been found to be effective treatments (Covey et al. 2000). Clonidine may be a helpful adjunct to nicotine replacement during acute nicotine withdrawal. Doses of 0.05mg to 0.1mg three times a day can be tried as tolerated (sedation and low blood pressure are con\u00ad cerns), and the medication needs to be tapered when discontinued to avoid rebound hyperten\u00ad sion. The Public Health Service's Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence: Clinical Practice Guideline (Fiore et al. 2000 a) has classified nortriptyline and clonidine as sec\u00ad ond\u00adline treatments. Clonidine is an antihy\u00adpertensive and may be appropriate for patients addicted to certain types of drugs but not appropriate for others. The antidepres\u00adsant selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) fluoxetine has been tested of multisite trials (Cook et al. 2004; Hitsman et al. 1999; Niaura et al. 2002) and found to have a small benefit at best, although for patients who experience mild depressive states it may be a worthwhile adjunctive treatment. The usefulness of other SSRIs for smoking cessation is unknown, but studies have generally been unfavorable. More infor\u00admation on smoking cessation for people with co\u00adoccurring substance use and other mental disorders can be found in appendix D of TIP 42, Substance Abuse Treatment for Persons With Co\u00adOccurring Disorders (CSAT 2005 c). Combination drug therapy Combining NRT products NRT products typically provide less than half the nicotine plasma levels that cigarette users achieve through smoking (Benowitz et al. 1997; Dale et al. 1995; Gupta et al. 1995; Lawson et al. 1998). To attempt to increase nicotine lev\u00adels, several clinical trials have evaluated the effectiveness of combining available products. The simultaneous use of nicotine gum and the nicotine patch has been evaluated in several studies. Short\u00adterm gains in cessation were seen with the combination compared to either medi\u00ad cation alone, but no long\u00adterm benefits in absti\u00ad nence were demonstrated (Anderson and Wetter 1997). Blondal and colleagues (1999) compared the combination of nicotine nasal spray and the nicotine patch to the patch alone and found that at 3 months 37 percent of the patients were smoke free (compared to 25 per\u00ad cent for the patch alone). An open\u00adlabel study of the combined use of nicotine inhaler and the nicotine patch found a 12\u00adweek cessation rate of 30 percent and good tolerability for the com\u00ad bination bining different types of nicotine replacement products, such as the patch and gum, on the premise that doing so will boost nicotine blood levels. Further rationale for this prac\u00adtice is that a \"passive\" nicotine delivery sys\u00ad tem (i.e., patch) produces relatively steady levels of nicotine in the body that prevent the user from going below a threshold minimum while \"active\" NRTs (i.e., gum, inhaler, spray, sublingual tablet, etc.) permit the user to respond to situational cravings with ad libi\u00adtum dosing on an acute basis. Several clinical trials have evaluated the effectiveness of com\u00adbining available NRT products (for a review see Silagy et al. 2000). After reviewing avail\u00adable data, the Guideline panel (Fiore et al. 2000a) felt that there was moderately strong evidence to conclude that \"Combining the nicotine patch with a self\u00adadministered form of nicotine replacement therapy (either the nicotine gum or nicotine nasal spray) is more efficacious than a single form of nicotine replacement, and patients should be encour\u00adaged to use such combined treatments if they are unable to quit using a single type of first\u00adline pharmacotherapy\" (Fiore et al. 2000 a, p. 77). Physical Detoxification Services for Withdrawal From Specific Substances 93 NRT using high\u00addose nicotine patch therapy The highest dose of nicotine available by patch is 22mg. Several studies have evaluated whether higher doses of nicotine (up to 44mg) improve abstinence rates. The effect of this strategy has been small and the routine use of higher dose patches is not recommended (Hughes et al. 1999; Killen et al. 1999). Combining nicotine patch and bupropion SR In a double\u00adblind, placebo\u00adcontrolled study, the combination of bupropion SR and the nico\u00ad tine transdermal patch showed higher absti\u00ad nence rates at 12 months (35.5 percent) com\u00ad pared to bupropion SR alone (30.3 percent), nicotine patch alone (16.4 percent), or placebo patch and pill group (15.6 percent) (Jorenby et al. 1999). This combination was well tolerated. Clinicians who use this combination should first start the patient on bupropion SR 150mg for 3 days and then increase the dosage to 150mg twice daily for 1 to 2 weeks prior to the day of smoking cessation. On the \"q uit day,\" nicotine patch therapy should be initiated and the combination treatment continued for 3 to 6 months (Okuyemi et al. 2000). Patient Care and Comfort Most smokers attempt cessation on an outpa\u00ad tient basis and without any assistance from professionals. However, if a patient decides that she or he wants help with smoking cessa\u00ad tion, it is important for the clinician to present a supportive and nonjudgmental attitude and develop a therapeutic alliance with the patient. It must be emphasized that nicotine depen\u00ad dence is a chronic relapsing disorder and that patients often make several attempts at quitting before succeeding. Most smokers who want treatment will seek help from their primary care physician. The physician has the responsibility of providing pharmaceutical treatment, education about common problems associated with cessation, and emotional support to patients attempting to quit. Discussing nicotine withdrawal symp\u00adtoms can often help allay patient concerns. Fear of weight gain is a barrier for many who want to quit smoking (French et al. 1995). This is an especially important issue for women and may deter their attempts to stop smoking (Gritz et al. 1989). Though the health gains of stopping smoking clearly out\u00adweigh the health risks of weight gain, this argument does little to assuage patients' fears. Dieting during smoking cessation is not recommended in general and has been shown to increase the likelihood of smoking relapse (Hall et al. 1992). Physicians should, howev\u00ader, recommend both exercise and proper nutrition for patients attempting to stop smoking. Patients should be informed that alcohol use also is considered a risk factor for relapse to smoking by most clinicians (Shiffman 1982), and patients who can abstain from drinking during the withdrawal period should do so. Patients generally will find a smoke\u00adfree envi\u00ad ronment helpful during quit attempts. If the patient lives in a household where others smoke, household members and friends can help by not smoking in front of the patient and limiting the number of smoking cues in their residence. Patients with more severe nicotine depen\u00ad dence may benefit from enrollment in a spe\u00adcialized smoking cessation program. They might also benefit from more intensive medi\u00adcal management using several drugs (NRT + anticraving), medication for longer periods of time, closer followup, and longer enrollment in treatment. There are a number of cessation programs available from organizations such as the American Lung Association (http://www.lungusa.org) and the American Cancer Society (http://www.cancer.org). Some community and local organizations also spon\u00adsor smoking cessation programs. For the most severely dependent smokers, there are a lim\u00adited number of residential facilities that treat nicotine dependence on an inpatient basis (Hurt et al. 1992). Providers of detoxification Chapter 4 94 services should be familiar with the programs available in their communities in order to make referrals. Marijuana and Other Drugs Containing THC Marijuana and hashish are the two sub\u00ad stances containing THC (delta\u00ad9\u00adtetrahydro\u00adcannabinol) commonly used today. The field of addiction medicine has given considerable attention to the question of whether there is a specific withdrawal syndrome associated with cessation from prolonged THC use. In the past, many have stated that there is no acute abstinence syndrome that develops in people who abruptly discontinue THC (CSAT 1995 d). More recently this has been called into question and most experts now believe that a THC\u00adspecific withdrawal syndrome does occur in some patients who are heavy users (Budney et al. 2001), though cannabis withdrawal is not yet included in the APA's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. The THC abstinence syndrome usually starts within 24 hours of cessation. The amount of THC that one needs to ingest in order to experience withdrawal is unknown. It can be assumed, however, that heavier consumption is more likely to be associated with withdraw\u00adal symptoms. The most frequently seen symp\u00adtoms of THC withdrawal are anxiety, restless\u00adness and irritability, sleep disturbance, and change in appetite (usually anorexia). Other symptoms of withdrawal are less frequently seen and appear to include tremor, diaphore\u00ad sis (sweating), tachycardia (elevated heart rate), and GI disturbances, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Cognitive difficulties including depression also have been reported and may persist but usually improve with time. There are no medical complications of withdrawal from THC, and medication is gen\u00aderally not required to manage withdrawal. Clinicians may see a variety of the symptoms mentioned above, but these generally require no immediate medication during the detoxifi\u00ad cation period and usually are self\u00adlimiting. However, the clinician should be aware of the potential for more persistent problems. Screening the patient for suicidal ideation or other mental health problems is warrant\u00aded. Some reviews Most experts now believe that a THC\u00adspecific with\u00ad drawal syndrome does occur in some patients who are heavy users, though cannabis withdrawal is not yet included in the APA's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders . have advocated the use of buspirone as an alternative to benzodiazepines for the management of persistent general\u00adized anxiety (Gatch and Lal 1998). Other common problems encountered during withdrawal can be managed with nonad\u00addictive, supportive medications. For patients with more persistent difficulty sleeping, clinical experience suggests that Trazodone may be useful. Trazodone can lead to low blood pressure upon stand\u00ading, dizziness, and may increase falls, particularly in indi\u00adviduals over age 60. Benzodiazepines and other addictive medi\u00adcations should be avoided. The patient should be encouraged to maintain abstinence from THC as well as other addic\u00ad tive substances. Some patients will require a substance\u00adfree, supportive environment to achieve and maintain abstinence. Clinicians should educate all patients about the effects of withdrawal, validate their complaints, and reassure them that their symptoms will likely improve with time. Symptomatic relief may be provided in order to increase the patient's comfort. Physical Detoxification Services for Withdrawal From Specific Substances 95 There are no clinical assessment instruments available that measure THC withdrawal. Both animal and human studies indicate that a withdrawal syndrome starts within 24 hours of cessation and may last for up to a week. Anabolic Steroids Anabolic steroids, as differentiated from cor\u00adticosteroids and female gonadotropic hor\u00admones, are androgens (male hormones) and subject to abuse as a means of increasing muscle mass. These agents also can pro\u00ad Interventions directed toward cessation should involve patient education regarding the dangers and medical complica\u00ad tions of anabolic steroids, their behavioral effects, and a thorough evaluation of the patient's rationale for misuse. duce aggressive, manic\u00adlike behavior that may include delusions (Lukas 1998). Males involved in profes\u00adsional sports, weight lifting, body building, or other pursuits that value muscular mass are more likely to use these substances than are women, although use in women has been reported. Adolescents use anabolic steroids to improve their appearance and may have increased access to these com\u00adpounds (Yesalis et al. 1993). The large numbers of anabol\u00adic steroid prepara\u00adtions that have medical and veteri\u00adnary uses are pri\u00ad marily obtained illegally through diversion. High doses of anabolic steroids can be medi\u00ad cally dangerous but side effects, usually involving endocrine, liver, central nervous system, and cardiac function, tend to be reversible upon cessation of anabolic steroid use. However, neither cessation nor disclo\u00adsure of anabolic steroid use can be assumed when treating these individuals. Withdrawal Symptoms Associated With Steroids Anabolic steroids can be associated with with\u00addrawal symptoms emerging after their abrupt discontinuation. Withdrawal symptoms include (in descending order of prevalence) craving for more steroids, fatigue, depres\u00adsion, restlessness, anorexia (loss of appetite), insomnia, reduced libido (sex drive), headaches, and nausea (Lukas 1998). It is not known how commonly this syndrome occurs, but steroid withdrawal appears more likely in heavy users. The clinician's index of suspi\u00adcion should be raised when evaluating indi\u00adviduals who are predisposed to steroid misuse and who exhibit these symptoms. Also indica\u00adtive of possible steroid abuse are certain physiological signs of androgen exposure, including hair loss, acne, dysuria (difficult or painful urination), small testicles, edema of the extremities, and rapid weight gain. Females can develop decreased breast size, acne, virilism (clitoral enlargement, excessive and abnormal bodily hair growth, male pat\u00adtern baldness) and amenorrhea (suppression of menstruation). Males who abuse steroids have been reported to possess a distorted body image and may inaccurately view them\u00adselves as small and weak (Pope et al. 1993). Medical Complications of Steroid Withdrawal Due to anabolic steroids' long duration of action, side effects that might emerge cannot be quickly reversed by the discontinuation of these substances. Therefore, related side effects might require medical management beyond the simple recommendation that steroids immediately be discontinued. Persistent side effects include urinary tract infections, bladder irritability, skin blistering (at the injection site), erythema (abnormal skin redness) when given as a skin patch, and Chapter 4 96 priapism (prolonged erections lasting hours). The latter condition involves a painful penile erection and constitutes an emergency that requires specialized medical attention. Edema (swelling) of the hands or feet, commonly seen with anabolic steroids, can be treated with diuretics (medications that increase urine flow). Elevated liver function tests and jaun\u00addice usually resolve with cessation of anabolic steroid administration, although hepatic car\u00adcinoma (cancer of the liver) has been report\u00aded. Other side effects such as headache, nau\u00adsea, vomiting, acne, insomnia, and lethargy are time\u00adlimited and resolve after steroid ces\u00adsation. Behavioral disturbances, such as psy\u00adchosis or severe aggressiveness, should be treated symptomatically with appropriate psychopharmacological interventions. In extreme cases of psychotic or manic presenta\u00adtions, emergency psychiatric hospitalization might be necessary to address dangerousness to self or others. Management of Steroid Withdrawal There is no recommended detoxification pro\u00adtocol for anabolic steroids. The key medical goal is that of persuading the patient to cease steroid misuse. This intervention should be followed by evaluating and treating any side effects (discussed above) that might be pre\u00adsent. Interventions directed toward cessation should involve patient education regarding the dangers and medical complications of anabolic steroids, their behavioral effects, and a thorough evaluation of the patient's rationale for misuse. A family meeting often is helpful if agreed upon by the patient. Unfortunately, education alone often is insuf\u00adficient. Patients with distorted body images might be especially difficult to dissuade from steroid misuse, and referral to psychotherapy by a qualified clinician trained in the treat\u00ad ment of body image disorder should be con\u00ad sidered. Similarly, patients who derive signifi\u00ad cant muscle gain from anabolic steroids might be resistant to cessation and may conceal con\u00adtinued steroid use. Patient Care and Comfort Patient comfort during steroid withdrawal can be achieved by addressing side effects, if pre\u00ad sent, that are discussed above. Counseling also is a useful intervention and specialized psychi\u00ad atric interventions may be necessary. If the individual also is using other substances of abuse, referral to drug or alcohol rehabilitative treatment should be made. Club Drugs Club drugs represent diverse classes of drugs that include sedative\u00adhypnotic type agents as well as stimulant/hallucinogens. Club drugs are illicit drugs used in the setting of nightclubs, dance clubs, parties, and \" raves.\" Raves are overnight dance parties, usually with several hundred people in attendance. Abuse of these drugs by adolescents and young adults has risen greatly in recent years. All healthcare professionals need familiarity with their short\u00ad and long\u00adterm effects. Although withdrawal syndromes have been reported with some of these drugs, this is not the most common clinical problem. Intoxication and severe intoxication with overdose are more frequent problems. With some of these compounds, there appears to be the potential for neurotoxicity (destructive effects on the nervous system) and persistent psychiatric and neurologic syndromes. At the present time, much of the available informa\u00adtion regarding club drugs comes from surveys and anecdotal case reports. Human laborato\u00adry studies and rigorously controlled clinical trials are not common. One difficulty in assessing the effects of intox\u00ad ication, overdose, withdrawal, and long\u00adterm health consequences of club drugs is that in general, there are no baseline evaluations of individuals before they used club drugs. Also, these individuals abuse more than one sub\u00adstance. Some of these patients may have had moderate to severe psychopathology (includ\u00ading psychosis) prior to their introduction to club drugs. In the past, some club drugs were Physical Detoxification Services for Withdrawal From Specific Substances 97 referred to as \"designer drugs\" because of their production in a laboratory rather than being processed from plant products. Hallucinogens Hallucinogens are a broad group of sub\u00adstances that can produce sensory abnormali\u00adties and hallucinations. Most hallucinogens have some adrenergic effects as well. Hallucinogens also are referred to as psychedelics and psychomimetics. The more traditional hallucinogens such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) are considered primarily serotonergic\u00adacting agents. Some of the other compounds include phenylethylamines which have hallucinogenic properties but act like amphetamines as well. These drugs include mescaline and MDMA (3,4\u00admethylenedioxy\u00adN\u00admethylamphetamine). Other drugs include MDA (3,4\u00admethylenedioxyamphetamine) and DOM (dimethyloxymethylamphetamine). (See section on ecstasy below.) Other hallucinogens are acetylcholine antagonists. These include belladonna, drugs such as benzotrophine used to treat parkinsonian symptoms, and many common over\u00adthe\u00adcounter antihis\u00adtamines. Hallucinogen intoxication often begins with autonomic effects, sometimes nausea and vomiting, and mild increases of heart rate, body temperature, and slight elevations of systolic blood pressure. Dizziness and dilated pupils may occur. The prominent effects dur\u00ading intoxication are sensory distortions with illusions and hallucinations. Visual distor\u00adtions are more common than auditory or tac\u00adtile ones. So\u00adcalled \"bad trips\" may involve anxiety including panic attacks, paranoid reactions, anger, violence, and impulsivity. Either due to delusions or misperceptions, individuals may feel they can fly or have spe\u00ad cial powers, and thus injure themselves in falls or other accidents. Suicide attempts also can occur during \"bad trips\" and possible suicidal ideation should be carefully evaluat\u00ad ed, even though it may be quite transient. Withdrawal syndromes have not been report\u00aded with hallucinogens; however, considerable attention has been paid to residual effects such as delayed perceptual illusions with anx\u00adiety, \"flashbacks,\" residual psychotic symp\u00ad toms, and long\u00adterm cognitive impairment. Controversies around these issues are not important in the clinical setting. The impor\u00adtant thing is to determine whether residual symptoms are present and provide an appro\u00adpriate environment and appropriate care for the individual who has them. Generally, staff of emergency rooms, clinics that treat people who abuse substances, and social detoxifica\u00adtion centers have individuals who are very familiar with \"talking down\" individuals with bad hallucinogenic trips. Acute intoxication and bad trips usually can be managed with placement of the individual in a quiet, nonstimulating environment with immediate and direct supervision so that the patient does not cause harm to herself or to others. Occasionally, a low dose of a short\u00ad or intermediate\u00adacting benzodiazepine may be useful to control anxiety and promote seda\u00adtion. Individuals with chronic depressive\u00adlike reactions may require antidepressant thera\u00adpy. Individuals with residual psychotic symp\u00adtoms are likely to require antipsychotic medi\u00adcations. On rare occasions, the use of a low dose, high\u00adpotency antipsychotic medication may be required orally or parenterally (any method other than the digestive tract, e.g., intravenously, subcutaneously, or intramus\u00adcularly). Assessment of residual psychiatric and cognitive symptoms should be made prior to treatment referral. Gamma\u00adhydroxybutyrate (GHB) GHB use has increasingly been reported in night clubs and at raves by adolescents and young adult populations. GHB is a compound that is produced in the central nervous sys\u00adtem, and it acts as an inhibiting neurotrans\u00admitter similar to GABA (Shannon and Quang 2000). In pharmacologic (medication\u00adpropor\u00ad Chapter 4 98 tioned) doses, GHB serves as a sedative\u00adhyp\u00ad notic medication. GHB intoxication may look like alcohol or sedative\u00adhypnotic intoxication. Although GHB is illegal, psychotropic com\u00adpounds 1,4\u00adbutanediol (1,4\u00adBD) are widely available chemical com\u00adpounds and may be obtained through catalogs and the Internet. These compounds produce effects similar to those of GHB. At the pre\u00adsent, overdose syndromes are more likely to be seen than withdrawal syndromes. Overdose syndromes may require airway and respiratory management. GHB has been stud\u00adied in Europe (Addolorato et al. 1999 a) in a randomized, single\u00adblind study comparing it to diazepam as a treatment for alcohol with\u00addrawal. GHB was as effective as diazepam in suppressing alcohol withdrawal symptoms and was said to be quicker in reducing anxi\u00adety and agitation with less sedation than diazepam. Because of its history of abuse in the United States, it is unlikely to be viewed as a therapeutic agent any time in the near future. Miotto and Roth (2001) describe a GHB with\u00addrawal syndrome, noting that it shares fea\u00adtures of both alcohol and benzodiazepine withdrawal. They have found this syndrome most pronounced in patients who have taken GHB around\u00adthe\u00adclock, at 2\u00ad to 4\u00adhour inter\u00advals. The GHB withdrawal syndrome has the prolonged duration of symptoms found in benzodiazepine withdrawal and features delirium tremens that appear early (often within an hour) with peak manifestations occurring within 24 hours; the delirium may last up to 14 days. Confusion, psychosis, and delirium are the most prominent features of GHB withdrawal, and the autonomic effects (i.e., tremor, diaphoresis [sweating], hyper\u00adtension, and temperature changes) are less severe than found in alcohol withdrawal. They note that brief periods of significant tachycardia (rapid heart rate) begin early in GHB withdrawal. Garvey and Fitzmaurice (2004) also report seizure activity in a case of GHB withdrawal in a male who had been using the substance regularly over a 2\u00adyear period, and Rosenberg and colleagues (2003) note that in severe cases GHB withdrawal may be life\u00adthreatening. Milder cases of GHB withdrawal syndrome may be managed with benzodiazepines such as lorazepam and supportive care. However, in more severe cases high doses of intra\u00ad venous benzodi\u00ad azepines (e.g., lorazepam) or barbi\u00ad not been reported with hallucinogens; however, consider\u00ad able attention has been paid to residual effects such as delayed perceptual illusions with anxiety, \" flashbacks,\" residual psychotic symptoms, and long\u00adterm cognitive impairment. turates (e.g., pheno\u00ad barbital, pentobar\u00adbital) may be required (Miotto and Roth 2001; Rosenberg et al. 2003). Patients experiencing GHB withdrawal are like\u00ad ly to have a high tol\u00aderance for the seda\u00ad tive effects of benzo\u00addiazepines and require large and frequent doses to manage the with\u00addrawal (Miotto and Roth 2001); in cases where high doses of lorazepam prove ineffective, pento\u00ad barbital may be effective (Sivilotti et al. 2001). Clonidine may be used to treat episodes of tachy\u00adcardia (rapid heart rate) (Miotto and Roth 2001). Ecstasy MDMA (3, 4\u00admethylenedioxy\u00admetham\u00ad phetamine) commonly known as ecstasy, was synthesized around the turn of the century and patented by Merck Pharmaceuticals in 1914 (Christophersen 2000; Parrot et al. 2000). These drugs are phenel\u00adethylene stimulants Physical Detoxification Services for Withdrawal From Specific Substances 99 with various substitution groups off the ben\u00ad zene ring that give the medications hallucino\u00ad genic properties. There are a number of relat\u00ad ed compounds that are designated by their ini\u00ad tials (MDMA, MDA, MDEA, DOM, 2\u00adCB, and DOT). Clinicians are likely to have to manage the complications of intoxication and overdose but not withdrawal. Patients using MDMA or related compounds frequently are hyperactive and hyperverbal, reporting heightened tactile and visual sensa\u00adtions. They frequently will use camphor on the skin in facial masks, gloves, and other clothing to heighten their tactile sensations. Sometimes light sticks are used to heighten visual experiences at raves. Hyperthermia, dehydration, water intoxication with low sodi\u00adum, rhabdomyolysis (severe muscular injury and breakdown of muscle fibers), renal fail\u00adure, cardiac arrhythmia, and coma have been reported. MDMA has been proven to be toxic to sero\u00ad tonergic neurons in several animal studies. Heavy ecstasy users can have paranoid think\u00ading, psychotic symptoms, obsessional think\u00ading, and anxiety (Parrott et al. 2000). Impaired cognitive performance in heavy ecstasy users also has been identified (Gouzoulis\u00adMayfrank et al. 2000). Ecstasy users performed more poorly than control groups in complex attention, memory, and learning tasks. The duration or permanence of such effects has not yet been well studied. Ketamine and PCP (Phencyclidine) Ketamine and PCP (phencyclidine) were both developed in the 1950s as anesthetic agents for humans. Phencyclidine was briefly marketed for human anesthetic use but taken off the market because of an unusual high incidence of psychotic symptoms. PCP remains in legitimate use for veterinarian anesthesia for large ani\u00ad mals as does ketamine for small animals. Although both drugs were originally developed for intravenous use, they are now manufac\u00adtured illicitly as oral drugs of abuse. PCP fre\u00ad quently is sold as LSD. Some studies have found that ketamine and PCP act specifically at the MDMA/glutamate receptor as noncompetitive MDMA receptor antagonists. Research in animals indicates that both drugs are reinforcing, in that ani\u00admals will press a bar to obtain doses of either drug. Furthermore, in these same animal models, abstinence syndromes have been observed. Withdrawal symptoms in humans have included depression, drug craving, increased appetite, and hypersomnolence (excessive sleep). In the clinical setting, syndromes of acute intoxication with hallucinations, delusions, agitation, and violence are the most pressing problems. A human laboratory study (Lahti et al. 2001) conducted a comparison of ketamine and placebo in normal volunteers never exposed to ketamine and to people with schizophrenia with a previous history of ketamine use. In both groups, ketamine pro\u00adduced a dose\u00adrelated, but brief, increase in psychotic symptoms. The magnitude of ketamine\u00adinduced positive psychotic symp\u00adtoms was similar for both groups, although the schizophrenia group had higher baseline scores. Although originally MDMA receptor antago\u00ad nists were felt to have neuroprotective effects (preventing damage to brain cells) and have been explored as post\u00adstroke medications, there is some evidence now that ketamine and PCP may in fact have some neurotoxic effects. Studies (e.g., Curran and Monaghan 2001) have found greater memory impairment among chronic ketamine users than infre\u00adquent ketamine users. Acute human laborato\u00adry studies by this group indicate persistent memory impairment with ketamine exposure. This same study did not find persistent psy\u00adchotic features beyond acute use. In the clinical setting, ketamine and PCP use require management for the agitation and psychotic features produced during acute use. Occasionally, patients will have such large 100 Chapter 4 overdoses, intentionally or accidentally, that they will require airway management and ventilatory support for some hours. The behavioral management of the agitation and violence that may be seen is best managed in a controlled environment with limited stimuli and very close supervision. Occasionally, oral or parenteral uses of sedating medications such as benzodiazepines will be required. In extreme cases, restraints may be required for protection of the patient and staff. Following acute management, assessment of persistent mood and cognitive effects must be made prior to any treatment attempts. The persistence of psychotic symptoms may repre\u00adsent an underlying psychiatric disorder that may require medication treatment. There are no studies to guide the treatment of ketamine or PCP detoxification. The need to manage withdrawal symptoms from these drugs is unlikely, but if it should arise, benzodi\u00adazepines should be administered. Other Rohypnol is a benzodiazepine that is sold under trade names in Europe and Mexico as a sedative\u00adhypnotic. Rohypnol is occasionally used as a club drug and at dance clubs. In the last decade it began to be smuggled into the United States and was commonly used among homeless youth involved in the sex industry. Rohypnol has a reputation as a \"date rape\" drug because it can produce powerful amnestic and hypnotic effects, as well as coma. For fur\u00ad ther details on benzodiazepines, see the benzo\u00ad diazepine section regarding intoxication and potential withdrawal reactions. Management of Polydrug Abuse: An Integrated Approach One of the most significant changes in detoxi\u00ad fication services in recent years has been the increase in the number of patients requiring detoxification from more than one substance. In an evaluation of admissions to publicly funded detoxification programs in Massachusetts between 1984 and 1996, McCarty and colleagues (2000) found a steady increase in the number of patients using both alcohol and other substances in the month prior to admission. In 1988, 26 percent of admissions reported using two or more sub\u00adstances in the previous month; by 1996 that number had nearly doubled to 50 per\u00adcent (McCarty et al. 2000). There is no One of the most significant changes in detoxification services in recent years has been the increase in the number of patients requiring detoxification from more than one substance. reason to believe that this trend has not appeared elsewhere in this country. As Miller and colleagues (1990 a) note, \"For the contemporary drug addict, multiple drug use and addic\u00adtion that includes alcohol is the rule\" (p. 597). In the Massachusetts evaluation, which did not include mari\u00adjuana or nonopioid prescription medica\u00adtion use, the most commonly seen com\u00adbination of sub\u00adstances was alcohol and cocaine. Thirty percent of patients admitted for detoxifi\u00adcation in 1996 reported using this combina\u00adtion; 12 percent used alcohol, cocaine, and heroin together; 10 percent combined alcohol and cocaine; and 7 percent combined heroin and cocaine (McCarty et al. 2000). Other studies, evaluating patient populations at inpatient treatment centers, found that between 70 and 90 percent of patients who reported cocaine abuse also abused alcohol. Rates of alcohol dependence among methadone patients and patients dependent on heroin were between 50 and 75 percent, Physical Detoxification Services for Withdrawal From Specific Substances 101 An Example of Potential Problems: Detoxification for Polydrug Abuse Mr. L is a 43\u00adyear\u00adold male with a 25\u00adyear heroin dependence. He is well known to the detoxification center, having been through the program there (which consisted primarily of support and hydration) on many occasions over the years. Though he looked more gaunt and, not surprisingly, a bit more ill each time he arrived, his course usually was about the same: 2 or 3 days of serious stomach cramps, nausea, and diar\u00ad rhea, then a few days of feeling poorly, and then a return to the community. This time, however, was differ\u00ad ent. He looked \" sicker\" than usual. Mr. L usually was a compliant patient; now he was hostile and belliger\u00ad ent. He seemed to be talking to himself and did not seem as alert as he should have been. The staff asked him several times if he had used anything else and each time he denied it. His drug of choice was always heroin\u2014he drank alcohol once in a while, and occasionally smoked marijuana when he could not get any\u00ad thing else. On the third day of detoxification, Mr. L seemed acutely more ill. On his way to the bathroom he was observed staggering, and as he reached for the door he fell, striking his head, and suffered a grand mal seizure. At the local hospital, a toxicological screen showed the presence of PCP, high levels of barbiturates, opioids, and trace amounts of benzodiazepines and 80 to 90 percent who were being treated for cannabis abuse also reported alcohol abuse (Miller et al. 1990 a). Clinicians need to be constantly aware that a patient may be abusing multiple substances. Even if a patient admits the abuse of one sub\u00adstance he may not admit to using others. Patients may not see that other substances are a problem, they may be worried about the legal consequences of use, or they sometimes may not even be aware of what substances they have been using. For these reasons, clin\u00adicians should not rely on patients' self\u00adreports to determine which substances are being used. Interviews with family, friends, or oth\u00aders who know the patient may be helpful, but these also are insufficient. The consensus panel strongly recommends that all patients receive an immediate urine drug screening upon admission to a detoxification program to determine the types of substances being abused. It is not necessarily true that the per\u00adson is drug free simply because a drug is not detected on a drug screen. It is possible that the toxicology is not able to detect the class or type of drug. Staff should be aware of what the program/detoxification center/hospital tests for, what is not tested for, what cannot be tested for or found, and the limitations of \"dip\" tests. Prioritizing Substances of Abuse While substances of abuse may have complex interactions, it is not always possible to deter\u00ad mine how those interactions will affect with\u00ad drawal. Therefore, it is generally best practice to prioritize the substances an individual has been dependent on and treat them sequentially according to the severity of the withdrawal pro\u00ad duced by the substance. The substances with the most serious withdrawal syndromes, those where the withdrawal syndrome can be fatal, are alcohol and the sedative\u00adhypnotics. When detoxifying a patient who has been dependent upon multiple substances, the sedative\u00adhyp\u00ad notics must be addressed first. Oral methadone, LAAM, or buprenorphine should be used to stabilize withdrawal from opioids while tapering the dose of the seda\u00adtive\u00adhypnotic or anxiolytic (anti\u00adanxiety medi\u00adcation) by 10 percent each day. After the patient has been tapered off of the sedative\u00adhypnotic or anxiolytic, withdrawal from the substitute opioid can begin (Wilkins et al. 1998). Some patients can successfully be detoxified from both sedative\u00adhypnotics and opioids simultaneously, but this requires a great deal of medical and nursing attention. Most patients will benefit from opioid mainte\u00ad 102 Chapter 4 nance for an extended period of time follow\u00ad ing the completion of sedative withdrawal. If the patient has been abusing multiple seda\u00ad tive\u00adhypnotic substances or a sedative\u00adhypnotic and alcohol, withdrawal should be handled in the same way as withdrawal from one such sub\u00ad stance. The patient should be administered a regularly decreasing dosage of sedative\u00adhypnot\u00ad ic, usually a benzodiazepine that the clinician is comfortable with and accustomed to using. The dosage should be decreased according to the patient's physiologic response. Providers also may administer an anticonvulsant such as car\u00ad bamazepine (Tegretol XR), even in the absence of epilepsy or withdrawal seizures, to help ensure patient safety (Wilkins et al. 1998). Phenobarbital also may be used for detoxifying patients who have been abusing both alcohol and benzodiazepines. When the dose of alcohol and sedative\u00adhypnotics that a patient is taking is not known, tolerance testing as previously described can be helpful in determining the dose of phenobarbital. When treating patients detoxifying from sub\u00ad stances other than sedative\u00adhypnotics, manage\u00ad ment of opioid detoxification should be the next priority. Generally, other substances of abuse, including stimulants, marijuana, hallucinogen\u00ad ics (LSD and similar drugs), and inhalants, will not require specific treatment in patients who are being detoxified from sedative\u00adhypnotics and/or opioids. Patients may abuse a wide range of substances in various combinations, and the clinician must be vigilant in assessing and treating withdrawal from multiple substances. The case study above illustrates some of the serious problems the clinician faces in evaluating and treating patients withdrawing from multiple substances. In the private sector, where money for toxico\u00ad logical screening is readily available, the first question many would ask concerning the case of Mr. L. is, \" Why wasn't the drug screen done sooner?\" However, those working in public facilities will recognize that such screenings often are unavailable or available only after an extended turnaround time. Toxicological s creening, even a hand\u00adheld screening, can be an expensive item for what often is a very limit\u00ad ed budget. Besides, in this case, the patient was believed to be a known quantity\u2014someone who only used heroin. This scenario is not uncommon. It is likely that the patient himself was unaware of what was in his body. One of the more frightening facts con\u00ad cerning the purchase of illicit drugs is the lack of knowledge of what is in them. To make buy\u00ad ers believe that they are buying a higher\u00adquali\u00ad ty product than they are, drugs often are cut with adulterants (inferior ingredients) that can produce effects similar to the drug they think they are buying. In this case, Mr. L may have been buying barbiturates and benzodiazepines in his heroin for some time without knowing it, a fact that could have had deadly conse\u00ad quences. Both are sedating and could have given him some of the comfortable sedation and euphoria he was seeking from his drug of choice. Unfortunately, however, where opioid withdrawal is not life\u00adthreatening, withdrawal from barbiturates can be. Furthermore, he could have gotten PCP in the marijuana he occasionally used, again without knowing it. Alternative Approaches Alternative methods that have been studied sci\u00ad entifically do not claim to be stand\u00adalone with\u00ad drawal methods, nor stand\u00adalone treatment modalities. Alternative approaches are designed to be used in a comprehensive, inte\u00ad grated substance abuse treatment system that promotes health and well\u00adbeing, provides pal\u00ad liative symptom relief, and improves treatment retention. Therefore, because isolation of any of these approaches as an independent variable in rigorous controlled studies is difficult, if not impossible, there are no conclusive data on the effectiveness of alternative methods (Trachtenberg 2000). Auricular (ear) acupuncture has been used throughout the world, beginning in Hong Kong, as an adjunctive treatment during opioid Physical Detoxification Services for Withdrawal From Specific Substances 103 detoxification for about 30 years. Its use in the United States originated in California (Seymour and Smith 1987) and New York (Mitchell 1995) but has not been subjected to rigorous controlled research. One report (Washburn et al. 1993) noted that patients dependent on heroin with mild habits appeared to benefit more than those with severe with\u00ad drawal symptoms, which acupuncture did not alleviate. The 1997 National Institute of Health Consensus Statement on acupuncture stated that acupuncture treatment for addiction could be part of a comprehensive management pro\u00ad gram. The National Acupuncture Detoxification Association has developed acupuncture protocols involving ear acupunc\u00ad ture in group settings that originated at Lincoln Hospital in the Bronx and are used by over 400 drug treatment programs and 40 percent of drug courts. SAMHSA's National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (NSSATS) found that 5.4 percent of the 13,720 facilities polled in 2001 offered acupuncture as a service (Office of Applied Studies 2002b). Acupuncture is one of the more widely used alternative therapies within the context of addictions treatment. It has been used as an adjunct to conventional treatment because it seems to reduce the craving for a variety of substances of abuse and appears to con\u00adtribute to improved treatment retention rates. In particular, acupuncture has been viewed as an effective adjunct to treatment for alco\u00adhol and cocaine disorders, and it also has played an important role in opioid treatment (i.e., methadone maintenance). It is used as an adjunct during maintenance, such as when tapering methadone doses. The ritualistic aspect of the practice of acupuncture as part of a comprehensive treatment program pro\u00ad vides a stable, comfortable, and consistent environment in which the client can actively participate. As a result, acupuncture enhances the client's sense of engagement in the treatment process. This may, in part, account for reported improvements in treat\u00ad ment retention (Boucher et al. 2003). A 1999 CSAT\u00adfunded study showed that patients choosing outpatient programs with acupunc\u00adture were less likely to relapse in the 6 months following discharge than were patients who had chosen residential programs (Shwartz et al. 1999). Ear acupuncture detoxification, which was originally developed as an alternative treat\u00adment for opioid agonist pharmacotherapy, is now augmenting pharmacotherapy treatment for patients with coexisting cocaine problems (Avants et al. 2000). The advocates of acupuncture have joined with the advocates of opioid agonist pharmacotherapy to create a holistic synthesis. Each has contributed to the success of the other, both clinically and in public perception. Care must be taken to ensure sterile acupunc\u00ad ture needles in the heroin\u00addependent popula\u00adtion, given the high incidence of HIV infec\u00adtion, viral hepatitis, and other infections. Acupuncture is not recommended as a stand\u00adalone treatment for opioid withdrawal. Other alternative management approaches that are not supported by controlled studies include neuroelectric therapy (the adminis\u00adtration of electric current through the skin) and herbal therapy. In fact, the former has been shown to be no better than placebo in a controlled study (Gariti et al. 1992). The use of herbs for healing purposes dates back to the dawn of civilization, while the use of herbs in the treatment of substance abuse has been documented since 1981 in methadone programs, free clinics, therapeutic communi\u00adties, outpatient programs, and hospitals (Nebelkopf 1981). Herbal remedies are used in substance abuse detoxification and treat\u00adment in a number of cultures around the world. However, in no scientific studies have herbs been isolated as a discrete variable to test their efficacy. Much research is currently being conducted on the effectiveness of herbal medicine on a wide variety of physical conditions. 104 Chapter 4 Considerations for Specific Populations All individuals undergoing detoxification are especially vulnerable. Patients who experience negative attitudes from staff may experience further loss of self\u00adesteem, may leave detoxifi\u00ad cation prematurely, or may experience other psychologically damaging feelings. Negative experiences can undermine the recovery pro\u00ad cess. It is important to recognize that individu\u00ad als do not fit into just one population category. A person will be a member of several popula\u00ad tions (e.g., a Latina woman who is pregnant, bisexual, and has psychiatric diagnoses of post\u00ad traumatic stress disorder and major depres\u00ad sion) and may benefit from a number of the considerations discussed below. It also should be noted that the information in the specific populations sections should not be used to cate\u00ad gorize individuals or leave the reader with the impression that the information below will fit all individuals who are members of a group. Pregnant Women While in detoxification, pregnant women should receive comprehensive medical care, especially since this may be the first time they have sought any type of care or treatment. Ideally, programs detoxifying pregnant women from alcohol and illicit drugs should include the following services: Detoxification on demand Woman\u00adcentered medical services Transportation services to and from detoxifi\u00ad cation (as well as to substance abuse treat\u00ad ment afterward) Childcare services Counseling and case management services Access to drug\u00adfree, safe, affordable housing Help with legal, nutritional, and other social service needs While it is recognized that provision of all of these services is an ideal to be striven for, at a minimum detoxification programs must have strong linkages to agencies that provide the above\u00admentioned services and should set up systems to ensure that pregnant women can access the additional services they need. Pregnant women who present for detoxification will benefit from a comprehensive medical examination that includes a careful obstetrical component. Since it is estimated that approxi\u00ad mately 44 to 70 percent of women who abuse substances have a his\u00ad tory of physical, emo\u00ad tional, and sexual Pregnant women who present for detoxification will benefit from a comprehensive medical examina\u00ad tion that includes a careful obstetrical component. abuse (Moylan et al. 2001; Stevens et al. 1997), care should be given to the comfort of the patients during the examination. One of the major internal barriers that prevents pregnant women from seeking treatment is the shame and stigma attached to substance use, especially during pregnancy. Any nega\u00ad tive experience encountered during detoxification can lead these women to leave treatment and not return. Detoxification during pregnancy poses a special risk in that care should be taken to ensure the health and safety of both the mother and fetus. From a clinical standpoint, before giving any medications to pregnant women it is of vital importance that they understand the risks and benefits of taking these medications and sign informed consent forms verifying that they have received and understand the information provided to them. Since pregnant women often present to treat\u00ad ment in mid\u00ad to late\u00adsecond trimester and poly\u00ad drug use is the norm rather than the exception (Jones et al. 1999), it is important first to Physical Detoxification Services for Withdrawal From Specific Substances 105 screen these women for dependence on the two classes of substances that can produce a life\u00ad threatening withdrawal: alcohol and sedative\u00ad hypnotics. Pregnant women should be made aware of all wraparound services that will assist them in dealing with newborn issues, including food, shelter, medical clinics for inoc\u00ad ulations, as well as programs that will help with developmental or physical issues that the neonate (newborn baby) may experience as a result of substance exposure. A National Institutes of Health consensus panel recommended methadone maintenance as the standard of care for pregnant women with opioid dependence. Alcohol When pregnant women are detoxi\u00adfied from alcohol, benzodiazepine tapers appear to be the current practice of choice. The cur\u00adrent state of knowl\u00adedge suggests that benzodiazepine therapy in general does not have as much of a terato\u00adgenic (producing a deformed baby) risk as do other anticon\u00advulsants as long as they are given over a short time period. It appears that short\u00adacting benzo\u00addiazepines, like the ones described to treat alcohol with\u00addrawal above, can be used in low doses for acute uses such as detoxification, even in the first trimester (Robert et al. 2001). Long\u00adacting benzodi\u00adazepines should be avoided\u2014their use during the third trimester or near delivery can result in a withdrawal syndrome in the baby (Garbis and McElhatton 2001). Although no teratogenic effects have been observed, little is known about the effects of naltrexone, naloxone, or nalmefene (Lopressor) are the beta blockers of choice for treating hypertension (high blood pressure) during pregnancy (McElhatton 2001), the impact of using them for alcohol detoxification during pregnancy is unclear. The use of SSRIs, a class of antide\u00adpressant medication, is safer for the mother and fetus than are tricyclic antidepressants (Garbis and McElhatton 2001). Fluoxetine (Prozac) is the most studied SSRI in pregnan\u00adcy and no increased incidence in malforma\u00adtions was noted, nor were there neurodevel\u00adopmental effects observed in preschool\u00adage children (Garbis and McElhatton 2001). However, possible neonatal withdrawal signs have been observed. Given that the greatest amount of data are available for fluoxetine, this is the recommended SSRI for use during pregnancy (Garbis and McElhatton 2001). The use of anticonvulsants, such as valproic acid, is associated with several disfiguring malformations. If this type of medication must be used during pregnancy, the woman must be told that there is substantial risk of malformations (Robert et al. 2001). Barbiturate use during pregnancy has been studied to some extent, and phenobarbital is used therapeutically during pregnancy, but the risk of any anticonvulsive medication should be discussed with the patient (Robert et al. 2001). There also are reports of a with\u00addrawal syndrome in the neonate following prenatal exposure to phenobarbital (Kuhnz et al. 1988). Opioids While it is not recommended that pregnant women who are maintained on methadone undergo detoxification, if these women require detoxification, the safest time to detoxify them is during the second trimester. For further information, consult the forth\u00adcoming TIP Substance Abuse Treatment: Addressing the Specific Needs of Women (SAMHSA in development e) and TIP 43 106 Chapter 4 Medication\u00adAssisted Treatment for Opioid Addiction in Opioid Treatment Programs (CSAT 2005 d). In contrast, it is possible to detoxify women dependent on heroin who are abusing illicit opioids by using a methadone taper. Before starting a detoxification, women should weigh the risks and benefits of detoxi\u00adfication, since many women eventually relapse to drug use and thus place themselves and their fetuses at risk for adverse conse\u00adquences (Jones et al. 2001 b). During pregnan\u00ad cy, the protein binding of many drugs, includ\u00ading methadone and diazepam (a benzodi\u00adazepine), is decreased (e.g., Adams and Wacher 1968; Dean et al. 1980; Ganrot 1972) with the greatest decrease noted during the third trimester (Perucca and Crema 1982). This decreased binding may be due to the decreased levels of albumin reported during pregnancy (Yoshikawa et al. 1984). From a clinical standpoint, it may be that pregnant women could be at risk for developing greater toxicity and side effects, yet at the same time an increase in metabolism of the drug may result (such as found with methadone). This may result in reduced therapeutic effect from the drug, since many women require an increase in their dose of methadone during the last trimester (Pond et al. 1985). Other medications used to treat the withdraw\u00ad al signs and symptoms include clonidine. Clonidine is used as a second\u00adline drug to treat hypertension (high blood pressure) dur\u00ad ing pregnancy and appears to lack teratogenic effects (McElhatton 2001). It has reportedly been abused by pregnant women. Some preg\u00ad nant women take clonidine with their methadone because it is hard to detect in urine and it increases the high they get from methadone. However, little is known about its effects on the baby following therapeutic doses given in a detoxification context or doses taken in higher than therapeutic amounts (Anderson et al. 1997 a). Buprenorphine has been examined in preg\u00ad nancy and appears to lack teratogenic effects but may be associated with a withdrawal syn\u00addrome in the neonate (Jones and Johnson 2001). A National Institutes of Health consensus panel recommended methadone maintenance as the standard of care for pregnant women with opioid dependence. Methadone currently is the only medication recommended for med\u00adication\u00adassisted treatment for pregnant women. Clinical trials are being conducted to determine the efficacy and safety of buprenorphine with pregnant women but it has not yet been approved for use with this population. Two early studies on treatment of pregnant women with opioid dependence with buprenorphine showed promising results (Fischer et al. 2000; Johnson et al. 2001). Comer and Annitto (2004) conclude, from their review of the research literature, that buprenorphine should be used more aggres\u00adsively to detoxify pregnant women who want to be opioid\u00adfree at delivery. Because of the potential for premature labor and delivery and risks of morbidity and mor\u00adtality to the fetus related to withdrawal from opioids, it is recommended that a pregnant woman who is dependent on opioids be main\u00adtained during pregnancy (Kaltenbach et al. 1998). Other reasons to stabilize a pregnant woman on methadone rather than attempt withdrawal are the risks of relapse, conse\u00adquences associated with HIV and use of multi\u00adple needles, and the potential lack of prenatal care. The Federal government mandates that pre\u00ad natal care be available for pregnant women on methadone. It is the responsibility of treat\u00adment providers to arrange this care. More than ever, there is need for collaboration involving obstetric, pediatric, and substance abuse treatment caregivers. Comprehensive care for the pregnant woman who is opioid dependent must include a combination of methadone maintenance, prenatal care, and substance abuse treatment. Physical Detoxification Services for Withdrawal From Specific Substances 107 Pregnant women should be maintained on an adequate (i.e., therapeutic) methadone dose. An effective dose prevents the onset of with\u00addrawal for 24 hours, reduces or eliminates drug craving, and blocks the euphoric effects of other narcotics. An effective dose usually is in the range of 50-150mg (Drozdick et al. 2002). Dosage must be individually deter\u00admined, and some pregnant women may be able to be successfully maintained on less than 50mg while others may require much higher doses than 150mg. The dose often needs to be increased as a woman progresses through gestation, due to increases in blood volume and metabolic changes specific to pregnancy (Drozdick et al. 2002; Finnegan and Wapner 1988). Generally, dosing of methadone is for a 24\u00ad hour period. However, because of metabolic changes during pregnancy it might not be pos\u00adsible to adequately manage a pregnant woman during a 24\u00adhour period on a single dose. Split dosing, particularly during the third trimester of pregnancy, may stabilize the woman's blood methadone levels and effec\u00adtively treat withdrawal symptoms and crav\u00ading. Breastfeeding is not contraindicated for women who are on methadone. Very little methadone comes through breast milk; the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Committee on Drugs lists methadone as a \"maternal medication usually compatible with breastfeeding\" (AAP 2001, pp. 780-781). Benzodiazepines The principles of detoxification from benzodi\u00ad azepines are the same for pregnant and non\u00ad pregnant patients. It is important to taper the dose of benzodiazepine slowly in order not to induce fetal withdrawal or other adverse con\u00ad sequences in the fetus or mother. Detoxification is most likely safest during the second trimester in order to avoid sponta\u00ad neous abortion or premature labor. For more information, see the forthcoming TIP Substance Abuse Treatment: Addressing the Specific Needs of Women (SAMHSA in devel\u00ad opment e). There is a documented withdrawal syndrome in neonates who have been prena\u00adtally exposed to benzodiazepines (Sutton and Hinderliter 1990), and this syndrome may be delayed in onset more than that associated with other drugs. Stimulants The principles of detoxification from stimulants such as cocaine are the same for pregnant and nonpregnant women. Since there is no current pharmacotherapy to use in tapering individuals from stimulant use, the use of any medications to treat medical complications that might arise from the withdrawal should only be done after discussion with the patient of the risks and ben\u00ad efits of each medication. Solvents The principles of detoxification from solvents are the same for pregnant and nonpregnant women. It should be noted that based on a review of case reports, there is a complex array of characteristics that appear to be sim\u00adilar to fetal alcohol effects. Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) is characterized by growth deficiency (born small for gestational age; failure to grow at a normal rate), particular facial features (e.g., eyes are too close togeth\u00ader, ears are set low on the head), and CNS dysfunctions (mental retardation, microen\u00adcephaly [small brain size]) and brain malfor\u00admations (Costa et al. 2002). Thus fetal devel\u00adopment in pregnant women who have a histo\u00adry of solvent abuse should be evaluated and carefully monitored (Jones and Balster 1998). Nicotine There is extensive documentation that smoking during pregnancy causes numerous adverse fetal consequences (see Schaefer 2001). Cigarette smoking during pregnancy is the largest modifiable risk for pregnancy\u00adrelated morbidity and mortality in the United States (Dempsey and Benowitz 2001). While women 108 Chapter 4 are undergoing detoxification, they should be offered education about the risk of cigarette smoking during pregnancy and, ideally, pre\u00ad vented from smoking. This is especially impor\u00ad tant since cigarette smoking is strongly associat\u00ad ed with decreased birth weight, which is a pre\u00ad dictor of developmental problems in newborns (Ernst et al. 2002). If women are unable to stop smoking using behavioral interventions, nico\u00ad tine replacement products may be used; how\u00ad ever, the woman should fully understand the possible risks and benefits of these pharma\u00ad cotherapies (Jones and Johnson 2001). It also is important to point out to patients that there are data to suggest that women may derive less benefit from NRT than do men and that they may derive greater benefit from some non\u00adNRT medications (e.g., bupropion), thus producing quit rates in women compara\u00adble with those in men (Perkins 2001). However, the data regarding the use of bupropion during pregnancy are limited. Examinations of the acute effects of NRT in pregnant women reveal that nicotine has min\u00adimal impact on the maternal and fetal cardio\u00advascular systems. NRT may well be viewed as the lesser of two evils, inasmuch as smoking cigarettes delivers, in addition to nicotine, thousands of chemicals. Among these are many that also are viewed as developmental toxins (e.g., carbon monoxide and lead). It is doubtful that the reproductive toxicity of cigarette smoking is primarily related to nico\u00adtine. Thus, if NRT is to be used during preg\u00adnancy, the dose of nicotine in NRT should be similar to the dose of nicotine that the preg\u00adnant woman received from her ad lib (when\u00ad ever desired) smoking. Although intermittent\u00ad use formulations of NRT (e.g., chewing gum) have been recommended over continuous\u00aduse formulations (e.g., transdermal patch) due to reductions in the total dose of nicotine deliv\u00adered to the fetus (Dempsey and Benowitz 2001), it is unknown what the impact of inter\u00admittent acute doses followed by withdrawal of nicotine has on the fetus. Marijuana, anabolic steroids, and club drugs The principles of detoxification from these drugs is the same for pregnant and nonpreg\u00ad nant women. The use of anabolic steroids dur\u00ad ing pregnancy is rare; however, these can be catastrophic to a pregnancy, and if use is found, a detailed ultrasound examination is recommended to determine the morphological (physical or structural) development of the fetus (Scialli 2001). Although the class of club drugs is rela\u00ad tively new there have been a few reports (McElhatton et al. 1999) suggesting that there is an increased risk of congenital malformation in neonates prenatally exposed to ecstasy. Other club drugs such as fluni\u00adtrazepam (Rohypnol) may have effects sim\u00ad ilar to those of some benzodiazepines; however, this is spec\u00ad ulative. For compre\u00adhensive information on the treatment of this specific popula\u00ad tion, see the forth\u00ad coming TIP Substance Abuse While women are undergoing detoxification, they should be offered education about the risk of cigarette smoking during pregnancy and, ideally, prevented from smoking. Treatment: Addressing the Specific Needs of Women (SAMHSA in development e). Older Adults It has been recommended that, when treating older adults, there should be a policy of using age\u00adspecific group treatment that is both sup\u00adportive and nonconfrontational (Royer et al. 2000; West and Graham 1999). Older adults may be dealing with depression, loneliness, Physical Detoxification Services for Withdrawal From Specific Substances 109 and loss of career or a loved one. Thus, as a standard policy, older adults should be screened for depression and grief or loss\u00adrelated issues. Similar to the situation with other specific populations, the detoxification setting should ideally have in place a policy that mandates, at a minimum, well\u00adestab\u00adlished linkage with general medical services and specialized services for the aging, because of their increased vulnerability to physical ailments. Establishing policies that create an environment that is positive and does not tol\u00aderate \"ageism\"\u2014a general tendency to react negatively toward elderly adults\u2014is impor\u00adtant for the optimal treatment of older indi\u00adviduals. Alcohol and other drug\u00adrelated disorders in elderly individuals often are more severe than those of younger individuals and they are at increased risk for co\u00adoccurring medical disor\u00adders. It is the medical complications rather than age itself for which detoxification in a medical setting is needed. The elderly may have slower metabolism of medications mak\u00ading dosage adjustments necessary in some cases. The elderly also may be at greater risk for drug interactions, since they may be receiving medications to treat other problems. A complete and careful assessment with ongo\u00ading monitoring should be done to examine the existence of diseases such as, but not limited to, heart disease, respiratory disease, dia\u00adbetes, and dementia. Potential for falls also should be evaluated in the context of pre\u00adscribed medications. The previously present\u00ad ed protocols for opioids, benzodiazepines, nicotine, marijuana, anabolic steroids, and club drugs (anabolic steroids and club drug abuse are rare in this population) appear to be applicable to the elderly popula\u00ad tion as long as sensitivity to the withdrawal medication is considered. TIP 26, Substance Abuse Among Older Adults (CSAT 1998 f), provides comprehensive information on the treatment of this population. People With Disabilities or Co\u00ad Occurring Conditions In any patient population, the clinician should expect to encounter persons with dis\u00adabilities including co\u00adoccurring medical or mental disorders. These patients often will require special assistance to overcome both physical and psychological barriers in under\u00adgoing detoxification and treatment, including their own psychological barriers that must be overcome, as well as those attitudinal and communication barriers that often prevent complete and clear understanding between patient and clinician or clinician and institu\u00adtion. Effective communication is essential for effective services. Accommodations must take into consideration the expressed preference of the individual with a disability. Substance abuse treatment programs need to be in com\u00adpliance with two Federal laws regarding this matter: the 1992 Amendments to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act [ADA] of 1990. According to the ADA, programs must remove or compensate for physical or archi\u00adtectural barriers to existing facilities when accommodation is readily achievable, mean\u00ading \"easily accomplishable and able to be car\u00ad ried out without much difficulty or expense\" (P .L. 101\u00ad336 \u00a7 301). Providers should exam\u00ad ine their programs and modify them to elimi\u00adnate four fundamental groups of barriers to treatment for people with disabilities and/or co\u00adoccurring disorders: (1) attitudinal barri\u00aders; (2) discriminatory policies, practices, and procedures; (3) communications barriers; and (4) architectural barriers. Federal, State, and other sources of assistance might be available to fund ADA\u00adrelated improvements. See TIP 29, Substance Use Disorder Treatment for People With Physical and Cognitive Disabilities (CSAT 1998 g) for further infor\u00ad mation. The following passage clarifies terms and addresses the basic issues presented by patients with disabilities and/or co\u00adoccurring disorders. Diseases, disorders, and injuries, 110 Chapter 4 whether congenital or acquired, can have diverse effects on organs and body systems. Conditions (and diseases) such as multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, diabetes, and cerebral palsy can lead to impairments, such as impaired cognitive ability, paralysis, blindness, or muscular dys\u00adfunction. These impairments in turn cause disabilities, which limit an individual's ability to function in various areas of life, such as learning, reading, and mobility. While dis\u00adeases, impairments, and disabilities are dis\u00adtinct categories, they often are used inter\u00adchangeably. These essential terms are defined in Figure 4 \u00ad15. The field of disability services has developed its own terminology to discuss physical, senso\u00adry, and cognitive disabilities (see definitions below), and many treatment providers of peo\u00adple with substance use disorders will not be familiar with these terms as the profession defines them. WHO has devised a method for the classification of impairments and disabili\u00adties (WHO 1980). This complex system has been simplified here into four main cate\u00adgories: 1. Physical impairments are caused by con\u00ad genital or acquired diseases and disorders or by injury or trauma. For example, spinal cord injury is a disorder that can cause paralysis, an impairment. 2. Sensory impairments include blindness and deafness, which may be caused by congenital disorders, diseases such as encephalopathy or meningitis, or trauma to the sensory organs or the brain. 3. Cognitive impairments are disruptions of thinking skills, such as inattention, memo\u00adry problems, perceptual problems, disrup\u00adtions in communication, spatial disorienta\u00adtion, problems with sequencing (the ability to follow a set of steps in order to accom\u00adplish a task), misperception of time, and perseveration (constant repetition of meaningless or inappropriate words or phrases). Figure 4\u00ad15 Some Definitions Regarding Disabilities Disease: An interruption, cessation, or disorder of body functions, systems, or organs. Impairment: Any loss or abnormality of psychological, physiological, or anatomical structure or func\u00ad tions. Disability: Any restriction or lack (resulting from an impairment) of the ability to perform an activity in the manner or within the range considered normal for a human being. A disability is always perceived in the context of certain societal expectations, and it is only within that context that the disadvantages resulting from a disability can be properly evaluated. Functional capacities: The degree of ability possessed by an individual to meet or perform the behav\u00ad iors, tasks, and roles expected in a social environment. Functional limitations: The inability to perform certain behaviors, fulfill certain tasks, or meet certain social roles as a consequence of a disability. Those limitations can be anatomical (e.g., amputation), physiological (e.g., diabetes), cognitive (e.g., traumatic brain injury), sensory (e.g., blindness, deaf\u00ad ness), or affective (e.g., depression) in origin and nature. They represent substandard performance on the part of the individual in meeting life activities and reflect the interaction between the person and the environment. (A list of the areas of functional capacity and disabilities most often assessed is in Figure 4\u00ad16, p112.) Sources: Livneh and Male 1993; Stedman 1990; World Health Organization (WHO) 1980. Physical Detoxification Services for Withdrawal From Specific Substances 111 Figure 4\u00ad16 Impairment and Disability Chart Impairment Category Common Disabilities Physical Spina bifida Spinal cord injury Amputation Diabetes Chronic fatigue syndrome Carpal tunnel Arthritis Sensory Blindness Hearing impairment Deafness Deaf\u00adblindness Visual impairment Cognitive Learning disabilities Traumatic brain injury Mental retardation Attention deficit disorder Affective Depression Bipolar disorder Schizophrenia Eating disorder Anxiety disorder Posttraumatic stress disorder Source: CSAT 1998 e. 4. Affective impairments are disruptions in the way emotions are processed and expressed. For the purposes of this discus\u00ad sion, affective impairments are considered to include problems caused by both affec\u00adtive and mood disorders, such as major depression and mania. These impairments include the symptoms of mental disorders, such as disorganized speech and behavior, markedly depressed mood, and anhedonia (joylessness). One of the most important practices that should be in place as a standard in any detox\u00ad ification setting is routine screening for dis\u00adabilities and co\u00adoccurring medical and/or psy\u00adchiatric conditions. The failure to recognize these problems in patients can result in poor outcomes (Cook et al. 1992). Additionally, intoxicated individuals with co\u00adoccurring depressive disorders are at high risk for sui\u00adcide attempts. Of course, an individual patient may present with two or more disabil\u00adities and/or co\u00adoccurring disorders. Clinicians treating people with co\u00adoccurring substance use and mental disorders should consult TIP 42, Substance Abuse Treatment for Persons With Co\u00adOccurring Disorders (CSAT 2005 b). 112 Chapter 4 All programs should make a good faith effort to provide equal access in as comprehensive a manner as possible for all patients. Individual unique needs should be taken into account when providing services. For example, patients with physical, sensory, or cognitive disabilities may need help with self\u00adcare (e.g., eating, grooming), moving (e.g., using stairs, walking), communication (e.g., reading, speaking), learning, social skills, and execu\u00adtive functions (e.g., planning and organiza\u00adtion, decisionmaking). Unresponsiveness to instructions, lack of participation in discus\u00adsions and activities, forgetfulness, or confu\u00adsion by an individual with cognitive disabili\u00adties should not be viewed as a lack of motiva\u00adtion, resistance, or denial. Programs may need to develop the expertise or engage an expert on cognitive disabilities to determine the limitations resulting from the substance abuse and those resulting from the disability. Both require patience in the response. Information presented to the person with a cognitive disability should include different and complementary media; for example, visu\u00adal and tactile materials can reinforce the usual verbal interaction. Programs also may need to alter their policies regarding the use of drugs prescribed for pain control, since most medications of this class are drugs with a high abuse potential. A num\u00adber of patients with substance use disorders also live with chronic pain. Living in a drug\u00adfree state may not be desirable if it is associ\u00adated with unrelieved pain, which can be quite disabling. The clinician should explore with patients what pain management options have been tried in the past, and which management medications are being used currently. Patients should be encouraged to discuss their feelings about pain and how it affects their daily life, and especially to what extent it curtails or prevents their participation in the activities of daily living. There are a number of alternative treatments for chronic pain. Acupuncture is already in use in some treatment programs for detoxifi\u00ad cation to help relieve symptoms of withdraw\u00adal. Physical therapy and exercise, chiroprac\u00ad tic care, biofeedback, hypnotism, and thera\u00adpeutic heat or cold are some other approach\u00ades to caring for persons with physical prob\u00adlems. Most of these alternative treatments have limited or no research support of their efficacy; yet some clinicians believe they work. Thus, consultation with experts on their use is necessary before starting a person with chronic pain on these remedies. An alternative model supports the idea that patients should be treated simultaneously in substance abuse treatment, mental/physical health, and detoxification settings, yet treat\u00adments may occur in separate facilities and be conducted by separate staff. The consequent task for all is to be supportive and knowl\u00adedgeable about each other's interventions. The severity of the addiction and medical/psychiatric problems at the time of detoxification entry should determine which acute services the patient receives first. Naturally, a person's medical and psychiatric disabilities must be accounted for in the preparation of any treatment plan. In some cases, substance abuse treatment cannot begin until issues relating to medical and psy\u00adchiatric disabilities are settled. There are a number of resources for clini\u00ad cians to employ, including experts in the field of disability services. Figure 4\u00ad17 (p. 114) dis\u00adcusses ways of locating expert help for treat\u00ading patients with disabilities and/or co\u00adoccur\u00adring disorders. Finally, integrated treatment combines sub\u00ad stance abuse treatment, treatment for co\u00ad occurring disorders, and detoxification services into one program. For more complete informa\u00ad tion on the treatment of many of these disor\u00ad ders, see chapter 5. African Americans For African Americans, entrance into detoxifi\u00ad cation has been associated with enrolling in fur\u00ad ther treatment, reductions in HIV/AIDS risk behaviors, and linkages with social and health\u00ad Physical Detoxification Services for Withdrawal From Specific Substances 113 Figure 4\u00ad17 Locating Expert Assistance \"Experts\" in disability services can be located in several ways, depending upon the nature of the patient's disability and the local resources available. Patients who understand their disability may in fact be the best \"experts\" on their condition and specific needs; however, it is not uncommon that persons requiring treat\u00ad ment for substance use disorders will not understand basic aspects of their situation or condition. In such cases, immediate family members or close friends may be important sources of information and guidance. The treatment team also should consider contacting other sources: A disability\u00adspecific service organization (e.g., United Cerebral Palsy, organizations for the blind or deaf such as the National Association of the Deaf and American Deafness and Rehabilitation Association, the Association for Retarded Citizens) Social workers Case managers Rehabilitation specialists Psychologists Nurses or physicians associated with a social service agency providing disability services for the individual patient in question (e.g., vocational rehabilitation, family services for people who are deaf and hard of hearing, the Department of Veterans Affairs' physical rehabilitation unit, community case management services) Other organizations recognized by the disability community (e.g., Centers for Independent Living, gover\u00ad nors' committees for persons with disabilities, Paralyzed Veterans of America, local or State consumer coalitions for persons with disabilities) Source: CSAT 1998 e. car e services (Lundgren et al. 1999). African Americans are at greater risk than other popu\u00ad lations for the co\u00adoccurrence of diabetes and hypertension (high blood pressure) that can predispose them to a risk of stroke. This should be taken into account when placing and monitoring them on withdrawal medications. In treating African\u00adAmerican patients, treat\u00ad ment efficacy and therapist efficacy may be associated with the therapist's understanding of how race plays a role in recovery (Luborsky et al. 1988; Pena et al. 2000). In addition, when working with counselors from other cultures, African Americans may dis\u00ad play mistrust and a reluctance to show any weakness. To overcome this mistrust and to build rapport, especially when the clinician is discussing the detoxification process, it is par\u00ad ticularly important for the clinician to keep in mind the standard of respecting the client as an equal partner in treatment. For further information on this subject (as well as infor\u00admation on working with members of other cultural/ethnic groups), see the forthcoming TIP Improving Cultural Competence in Substance Abuse Treatment (SAMHSA in development a). The previously discussed protocols for detoxi\u00adfication from all substance of abuse appear adequate for the detoxification of African Americans. However, there are a few further aspects to consider: If treating African Americans with beta blockers, propranolol is less effective in treating African Americans than Caucasians (Pi and Gray 1999). African Americans are more likely (15 to 25 percent) to have less of the enzyme activity 114 Chapter 4 needed to eliminate diazepam than others, so it may have a longer half\u00adlife in African Americans than it does in other ethnic groups (Pi and Gray 1999). Since co\u00adoccurring disorders such as depres\u00ad sion frequently are seen in people with sub\u00ad stance use disorders, it is important to know that African Americans may require lower doses and may be at greater risk of develop\u00ad ing toxic side effects when prescribed antide\u00ad pressants, since they are likely to metabolize tricyclic antidepressants and SSRIs less effi\u00ad ciently than Caucasians (Pi and Gray 1999). Although the clearance of nicotine is similar for African Americans and Caucasians, the clearance of cotinine, a metabolite of nico\u00ad tine, is slower in African Americans, which may cause different smoking patterns than found in Caucasians (Ahijevych 1998). Asians and Pacific Islanders This group is the most diverse in nations of origin and has widely differing languages, beliefs, practices, dress, and values. Often the only common thread among these people is their geographic origin (Chang 2000). Although this group appears to have lower rates of alcohol and illicit drug use, these problems should not be overlooked; members of this group may not seek treatment until the problems are quite severe. Successful treat\u00adment involves the family and important val\u00adues include balance, harmony, wisdom, and modesty. Thus, it may be important to talk to the family about the process of detoxification and dispel their fears and concerns as well as the patient's. Asians and Pacific Islanders tend to be con\u00ad cerned about the clinician's credibility and trustworthiness. Generally speaking, male\u00ad ness, mature age, the projection of self\u00adconfi\u00ad dence, possession of sound cultural compe\u00ad tence skills, good educational background, and level of experience are of importance. In addition, a concrete logical approach to the problem at hand is valued (Brems 1998). The previously discussed protocols for detoxifica\u00ad tion from all substances of abuse appear ade\u00adquate for the detoxification of Asians and Pacific Islanders. During the detoxification process, there are a number of issues to con\u00adsider: If possible and appropriate, incorporate tra\u00ad ditional healing methods (e.g., meditation and religious exercises). These can help reduce stress and anxiety and promote recov\u00ad ery (Chang 2000). While there is a large immigrant population among many Asian\u00ad American groups, it is erroneous to assume that all are foreign born. Variation in prac\u00ad tice of traditional healing methods is consid\u00ad erable and consistent with generational dif\u00ad ferences. When considering detoxification, recognize the importance of bicultural prac\u00ad tices, values, and beliefs that might influence responsiveness to treatment. When discussing detoxification medications, discuss with patients their feelings about tak\u00ad ing \" Western\" medications for detoxification. In some Southeast Asian cultures, Western medications are believed to be too strong for the Asian person. It is important to assess a person's feelings about these since the patient may not wish to disagree with the clinician yet may be noncompliant in taking the medi\u00ad cations. Compliance with detoxification medi\u00ad cation may be better achieved if doses are reduced or regimens shortened, yet this should only be attempted if it is in the best interest of the patient. R acial differences in alcohol sensitivity among Asians and Caucasians have long been recognized, with more than 80 percent of some Asians compared to 10 percent of Caucasians being sensitive to alcohol (i.e., having a flushing reaction) (Wolff 1972, 1973). This is the result of genetic differences in alcohol metabolizing enzymes. Approximately 50 percent of Asians lack the enzyme ALDH2, found in the liver, that helps the body get rid of alcohol (Hsu et al. 1985; Yoshida et al. 1985). One reason for lower drinking rates among Asians may be the flushing reaction in the face and body follow\u00ad ing alcohol ingestion and an increase in skin temperature. Other uncomfortable signs and symptoms associated with the negative reac\u00ad Physical Detoxification Services for Withdrawal From Specific Substances 115 tion to alcohol ingestion can include nausea, dizziness, headache, fast heartbeat, and anx\u00ad iety (Caetano et al. 1998). Five studies have shown that the metabolism of codeine is slower in Chinese people than in Caucasians. Chinese patients seem to require lower doses of codeine, since the slower metabolism leads to a higher concen\u00adtration of codeine in the blood (Smith and Lin 1996). If treated with beta blockers, Asians require much lower doses than Caucasians, since they are very sensitive to this medication's blood pressure and heart rate effects (Pi and Gray 1999). Asians as a group have a higher number of individuals than other ethnic groups who are poor metabolizers of diazepam. This may result in the need for lower doses, since they report greater sedative effects with a typical dose (Lesser et al. 1997). It also may be that a lower body fat, which is typical of Asian\u00adAmerican individuals, can lead to differences in the pharmacokinetics of lipophilic drugs (Lesser et al. 1997). In treatment for co\u00adoccurring depression and a substance use disorder, Asians appear to metabolize clomipramine more slowly than Caucasians (Pi and Gray 1999). In contrast, Asians may metabolize phenelzine faster, resulting in the need for a higher dose relative to that which would be appropriate for Caucasians (Pi and Gray 1999). Chinese Americans tend to metabolize nico\u00ad tine 35 percent more slowly than Hispanics/Latinos and Caucasians. Thus, they may need to smoke less frequently and take in less nicotine to achieve the same nicotine levels as do Hispanics/Latinos and Caucasians. This may have implications for the dosing of NRTs (Benowitz et al. 2002). Smoking rates among male Asian Americans, especially immigrant males, are exceedingly high and masked by the lower rates among Asian\u00adAmerican females. American Indians There are currently more than 500 federally recognized American\u00adIndian tribes, and there is among them great variability in appear\u00adance, dress, values, religious beliefs, prac\u00adtices, and traditions. More than 200 different languages are spoken by American\u00adIndian tribes. Alcohol use varies widely among tribes (Mancall 1995). Of all ethnic and racial groups, American Indians have the greatest rates of alcohol and illicit drug use (Office of Applied Studies 2002 a). An early study of treatment utilization by American Indians found that there was a sig\u00adnificant association between involvement in society and treatment outcomes. Those involved in either the traditional Indian soci\u00adety or both the traditional Indian society and Caucasian society had more than a 70 percent success rate, whereas those involved in nei\u00adther society had a 23 percent success rate (Ferguson 1976). At a 10\u00adyear followup, those who had reported greater Indian culture affil\u00adiation and more severe liver dysfunction at baseline had better alcohol treatment out\u00adcomes (Westermeyer and Neider 1984). When engaging an American Indian in the process of detoxification, moving through the process too quickly or abruptly can be per\u00adceived as showing a lack of caring and is con\u00adsidered contrary to trust building (Brems 1998). The pace of conversation is important; a slower pace is more agreeable than a rapid conversation. Moreover, a confrontational approach also is not advised with this popula\u00adtion (Abbott 1998). American Indians may want a close and involved relationship with their therapists and often want the clinician to be a friend or relative (Brems 1998). The trust often is built by idle small talk to a level of shared understanding. Use of fables and illustrative stories to express ideas can be extremely helpful. According to the forthcom\u00ading TIP Improving Cultural Competence in Substance Abuse Treatment (SAMHSA in development a), avoidance of eye contact also is traditional. The Talking Circle is a native 116 Chapter 4 tradition that can be helpful in the treatment process (Canino et al. 1987; Coyhis 2000). The previously discussed protocols for detoxi\u00adfication from all substances of abuse appear adequate for the detoxification of American Indians. The following are some issues to con\u00adsider during detoxification. Fetal Alcohol Syndrome is 33 times higher in this population than the national average (SAMHSA in development a). This may be important for pregnant women coming to detoxification and also may be important if the adult has FAS. Indian women who drink have a six\u00adfold increase in cirrhosis of the liver relative to Caucasian women (Heath 1989). Although some American Indians have reported a flushing response to alcohol, it appears that the flushing reaction in American Indians is milder and less adverse than that experienced by Asians (Gill et al. 1999). If Alcoholics Anonymous or other 12\u00adStep programs are to be introduced, framing the steps in terms of a circle rather than a ladder may be better received, since the circle is important concept in Indian culture (SAMHSA in development a). If possible and appropriate, other traditional methods that can help recovery are sweat lodges, vision quests, smudging ceremonies, sacred dances, and four circles (Abbott 1998). Overall, detoxification for this population is the same as for other populations, but American Indians are likely to seek treatment later and have more medical complications and poorer nutrition (Abbott 1998). Hispanics/Latinos Hispanics/Latinos are now the largest ethnic minority group in America. Assessment of the patient's level of acculturation can be helpful in understanding substance abuse patterns. Language is one of the most difficult barriers to treatment entry and success for Hispanics/Latinos. However, simply knowing Spanish or Portuguese does not guarantee cultural sensitivity or competence. For instance, it is important that the treatment staff understand the role of the family. The functional family can be extended and shouldtake into account people who have day\u00adto\u00addacontact with and a role in the family (Markarian and Franklin 1998). Hispanics/Latinos are likely to view drug dependency as moral failing or personal weakness. Traditional healing such as folk y remedies and folk healers may provide benefit. The previ\u00adously discussed pro\u00adtocols for appear ade\u00adquate for the detoxi\u00adfication of Hispanics/Latinos. Gays and Lesbians Approximately 5 to 33 percent of all les\u00adbian and gay individ\u00aduals are estimated to have a substance abuse problem (Cochran and Mays 2000; Hughes and Wilsnack 1997). A Hispanics/Latinos are now the largest ethnic minority group in America. Assessment of the patient's level of acculturation can be helpful in understanding substance abuse patterns. contributing factor may be the stress and anxiety associated with the social stigma attached to homosexuality. Further, alcohol and drugs may serve as an escape and ease social interactions at social settings such as bars. More information on this subject will be available in the forthcoming TIP Improving Cultural Competence in Substance Abuse Treatment (SAMHSA in development a). The previously discussed protocols for detoxifica\u00ad Physical Detoxification Services for Withdrawal From Specific Substances 117 tion appear adequate for gay and lesbian patients. Since numerous misconceptions and stereotypes exist concerning gay and lesbian individuals, it is important for the clinician to assess his beliefs and take care not to impose them on the patient. There are a number of principles of care for treating gay and lesbian individuals, which are outlined in A Provider's Introduction to Substance Abuse Treatment for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Individuals (CSAT 2001). These principles include: (1) counselors' being able to monitor their own feelings about working with this population of patients in order to provide professional, eth\u00adical, and competent care; (2) helping patients heal from the negative experiences of homo\u00adphobia and heterosexism; (3) helping patients understand their reactions to discrimination and prejudice; and (4) helping patients accept personal power over their own lives by help\u00ading them improve their self\u00adimages and build support networks. Adolescents The previously discussed protocols for detoxifi\u00ad cation from all substances of abuse appear ade\u00ad quate for the detoxification of adolescents; however, there are several additional aspects to consider: Physical dependence generally is not as severe, and response to detoxification is more rapid than in adults. Retention is a major problem in adolescent treatment (Thurman et al. 1995). Peer relationships play a large role in treat\u00ad ment. Among adolescents who do not use drugs, few of their friends reported use. In one study, among those who reported specific drug use, over 90 percent of their friends reported using the same drug (Dinges and Oetting 1993). It is estimated that 75 percent of those reporting steroid use are high school stu\u00ad dents, and most of them are male. Detoxifica\u00ad tion from steroids does not typically require specific pharmacological intervention unless t here is liver toxicity or suicidal intent ( Giannini et al. 1991). The use of club drugs i s higher in this population than in others. TIP 31, Screening and Assessing Adolescents for Substance Use Disorders (CSAT 1999 d), and TIP 32, Treatment of Adolescents With Substance Use Disorders (CSAT 1999 f), pro\u00ad vide comprehensive information on the treat\u00ad ment of adolescents. Incarcerated/Detained Persons Substance use disorders are common among inmate populations. At the time of arrest and detention, it has been estimated that 70 to 80 percent of all inmates in local jails and State and Federal prisons had regular drug use or had committed a drug offense, and 34 to 52 percent of these inmates were intoxicated at the time of their arresting offense (Federal Bureau of Prisons 2000; Mumola 1999). Although women comprise a small proportion of the incarcerated population (12.3 percent in jails and 7.4 percent in State and Federal prisons) than men (Harrison et al. 2004), females have a greater prevalence of illicit drug use (i.e., 40 percent compared to 32 per\u00adcent were under the influence of drugs at the time the crime was committed) than do males (Greenfeld and Snell 1999). Persons who are incarcerated or detained in holding cells or other locked areas should be screened for physical dependence on alcohol, opioids, and benzodiazepines and provided with needed detoxification and treatment. Screening should occur over time, since the onset and intensity of withdrawal is depen\u00addent on the type of drug taken, when the per\u00adson last took the drug, and how long the drug lasts in the person's body. The duration of detention will affect what detoxification ser\u00advices can be provided, and many facilities will not be able to provide detoxification or con\u00adtinuing care services. There are some special considerations for the detoxification of this population: Abrupt withdrawal from alcohol can be life\u00ad threatening. 118 Chapter 4 Abrupt withdrawal from opioids or benzo\u00ad diazepines is not life\u00adthreatening but can cause severe withdrawal signs and symp\u00adtoms and great distress. It should be determined whether depen\u00ad dence on either opioids or benzodiazepines is the result of illicit use and not the result of taking medications that have been pre\u00adscribed to treat pain or anxiety disorders. If medically supervised withdrawal is indi\u00ad cated, the substitution of a long\u00adacting drug from the same class of substances the patient is using (e.g., giving methadone to treat heroin dependence) and the gradual tapering of that substance (no faster than 10 to 20 percent per day) should be con\u00adducted under closely monitored settings. There are cases when individuals main\u00ad tained on opioid agonist medications are detained or incarcerated. If the incarcera\u00adtion is 30 days or less, the individual should be maintained on her usual dosage. If the incarceration is longer, the individual may be appropriate for gradual dose tapering. Persons who transition from a state of opi\u00ad oid dependence to a drug\u00ad or medication\u00adfree state are at greater risk of overdose upon relapse to opioid use. Many correctional facilities have restric\u00ad tions on the use of methadone or LAAM and special provisions for maintaining or taper\u00ading the individual may need to be made. If medications are provided to medically detoxify inmates, the Federal Bureau of Prisons' Clinical Practice Guidelines for Detoxification of Chemically Dependent Inmates (2000) suggest retaining strict con\u00ad trol over access to these medications to pre\u00advent diversion or misuse (e.g., eating cloni\u00addine patches to obtain a state of euphoria).

Physical Detoxification Services for Withdrawal From Specific Substances 119 In This Chapter... General Principles of Care for Patients With Co\u00ad Occurring Medical Conditions Treatment of Co\u00adOccurring Psychiatric Conditions Standard of Care for Co\u00adOccurring Psychiatric Conditions 5 Co\u00adOccurring Medical and Psychiatric Conditions Patients undergoing detoxification frequently present with medical and psychological conditions that can greatly affect their overall well\u00adbeing and the process of detoxification. These may simply be pre\u00adexisting medical conditions not related to substance use or the direct outcome of the substance abuse. In either case, the detoxification pro\u00adcess can negatively affect the co\u00adoccurring disorder or vice versa. Furthermore, people who abuse substances often present with medical conditions in advanced stages or in a medical crisis. Co\u00adoccurring mental disorders also are likely to be exacerbated by substance abuse. For more on treating patients with co\u00adoccurring psychiatric disorders, the reader should refer to TIP 42, Substance Abuse Treatment for Persons With Co\u00adOccurring Disorders (Center for Substance Abuse Treatment [CSAT] 2005 c). This chapter is intended primarily for medical personnel treating patients in detoxification settings, though nonmedical staff may find it informative as well. This chapter is not meant to take the place of authoritative sources from internal medicine. Rather, it presents a cursory overview of special conditions, modifications in protocols, and the use of detoxification medications in patients with co\u00adoccurring conditions or disorders. Overall treatment of specific conditions is not addressed unless modification of such treatment is needed. 121 General Principles of Care for Patients With Co\u00adOccurring Medical Conditions Patients who use substances can present with any of the conditions or combinations of con\u00additions that can be found in the general popu\u00adlation. In most cases, the management of the medical condition in the patient with a sub\u00adstance use disorder diagnosis does not differ from that of any other patient. However, the medication used for detoxification and the actual detoxification protocol may need to be modified to minimize potentially harmful effects relevant to the co\u00adoccurring condition. Detoxification staff providing support should be familiar with the signs and symptoms of common co\u00adoccurring medical disorders. Likewise, personnel at medical facilities (i.e., emergency rooms, physicians' offices) should be aware of the signs of withdrawal and how it affects the treatment of the presenting med\u00adical conditions. The setting in which detoxification is carried out should be appropriate for the medical conditions present and should be adequate to provide the degree of monitoring needed to ensure safety (e.g., oximetry [a measurement of the amount of oxygen present in the blood], greater frequency of taking vital signs, etc.). Acute, life\u00adthreatening conditions need to be addressed concurrently with the withdrawal process and intensive care unit monitoring may be indicated. Clinicians should keep in mind that consulta\u00ad tion with specialists in infectious diseases, cardiology, pulmonary medicine, hematology, neurology, and surgery may be warranted. Whenever possible, consent should be sought to involve the patient's primary healthcare provider in the coordination of care. Attending medical staff should be aware that co\u00adoccurring medical conditions present an opportunity to engage patients. By focusing on the adverse effects of the substance abuse on the overall health of patients, staff mem\u00adbers are in a position to help patients see the importance of engaging in treatment for their substance use disorders. Patients should have appointments for followup care made prior to detoxification discharge for all chronic medi\u00adcal conditions, conditions needing further evaluation, and substance abuse treatment. This section highlights the conditions most frequently seen in individuals who abuse sub\u00adstances, though it is not inclusive. Disorders of the following systems will be covered: gas\u00adtrointestinal (including the gastrointestinal [GI] tract, liver, and pancreas), cardiovascu\u00adlar system, hematologic (blood) abnormali\u00adties, pulmonary (lung) diseases, diseases of the central and peripheral nervous system, infectious diseases, and special miscellaneous disorders. Where special considerations are needed for a patient presenting with a given disorder in a detoxification setting they are listed following the heading \"Special Considerations.\" Gastrointestinal Disorders Frequently, the use of substances can present a range of gastrointestinal problems. Cocaine use, for example, can result in various gas\u00adtrointestinal complications, including gastric ulcerations, et al. 2000). Gastrointestinal disorders may affect many different organs and organ systems (e.g., liver, pancreas), making diagnosis diffi\u00adcult. Since symptoms can be vague and patients are not always able to articulate the specific problem, diagnosis can be difficult. For a simple rule of thumb, urgent attention is needed if the patient is diagnosed with any of the following: Appendicitis Abdominal aortic aneurysm Perforated peptic ulcer Boerhaave's Syndrome (spontaneous esophageal rupture) Obstructed or strangulated bowel 122 Chapter 5 Ischemic bowel disease (a condition that results from inadequate blood supply to the intestines) Abcess of the pancreas or liver Ruptured spleen or other trauma to the abdominal area Other possible diagnoses of abdominal pain include: Hepatitis Peptic ulcer (nonperforating) Peritonitis Acute pancreatitis Pelvic inflammatory disease Endometriosis Nephrolithiasis (kidney stones) Inflammatory bowel disease Ovarian cysts Clinicians should also be aware of some decep\u00ad tive of abdominal infection) Specific co\u00adoccurring gastrointestinal disorders requiring special attention in patients undergo\u00ad ing detoxification are discussed below. Reflux esophagitis Reflux esophagitis can be a result of alcohol's effect on the lower esophageal sphincter (i.e., relaxation) and a decrease in peristalsis of the distal esophagus, allowing gastric contents to come into contact with the lower esophagus. Typical symptoms include burning in the epi\u00ad gastric or retrosternal area (commonly called \"heartburn\" or \"indigestion\"). Esophageal bleeding can result from reflux esophagitis and esophageal varices (resulting from portal hypertension). Special considerations Several drugs used in typical protocols, such as beta blockers and calcium channel blockers, ma y decrease lo wer esophageal sphincter pres\u00ad sure and aggravate reflux (Dell'Italia 1994). Mallory-Weiss Syndrome Mallory-Weiss Syndrome is caused by torn mucosa of the esophagus at the gastro\u00ad esophageal junction due to protracted or vio\u00ad lent vomiting. Mallory-Weiss Syndrome is the etiology of 5 to 15 percent of all upper GI bleeds (Schuylze\u00adDelrieu and Summers 1994). Boerhaave's syndrome Boerhaave's syn\u00ad drome is manifested by rupture of the esophagus. Patients presenting with this condition complain of acute epigastric pain (83 percent of patients), vomiting (79 percent), and shortness of breath (39 percent) as the predominant, nonspe\u00ad cific symptoms. This lack of specificity can delay making the cor\u00ad rect diagnosis (Brauer et al. 1997). Tachycardia, cyanosis, and subcu\u00ad taneous emphysema also can be seen. If this condition is left Co\u00adoccurring medical conditions present an opportunity to engage patients in treatment for their substance use disorders. u nt reated, the prognosis is severe. Gastritis Gastritis is described as the disruption of the gastric mucus lining that allows gastric acid to contact the mucosa with resultant inflammation and possible bleeding. The patient presents with nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain (Ivey 1981). Alcohol increases gastric acid secretion and reduces the mucosal cell barrier, Co\u00adOccurring Medical and Psychiatric Conditions 123 allowing back\u00addiffusion of the gastric acid into the mucosa. This frequently causes an occur\u00ad rence of erosive gastritis in the individual with an alcohol use disorder (Fenster 1982). Special considerations Aspirin and nonsteroidal medications should be avoided in the withdrawal protocols. Pancreatitis Pancreatitis can be caused by many fac\u00ad tors, although stud\u00adies suggest that alco\u00adhol may be a factorin anywhere from 5 to 90 percent of all cases (Apte et al. 1997), with some experts suggesting about 60 percent of all cases result fromexcessive alcohol consumption (Yakshe 2004). The acute condition pre\u00adsents with abdomi\u00adnal pain, which is described as sharp, burning, and con\u00adstant and is located in the epigastric area of the Detoxification staff providing support should be familiar with the signs and symptoms of com\u00ad mon co\u00adoccurring medical conditions. abdomen with radiation to the back. Presenting symptoms and signs can include abdominal tenderness, decreased bowel sounds, low\u00adgrade fever, tachycardia, nausea, and vomiting. Pancreatitis can proceed to a chronic condition where pancreatic calcifica\u00ad tion, diabetes mellitus, malabsorption, and chronic abdominal pain occur. Special considerations There may be a need to forbid oral intake of food and medications, necessitating a change of route of administration of both food and medications to intravenous forms. In alcohol withdrawal protocols, Ativan might be consid\u00adered as an appropriate agent, as it can be administered intravenously or intramuscular\u00adly. Opioids may have to be used to control pain. Liver disorders Liver disease can range from fairly benign fatty liver, which presents usually as an asymptomatic enlargement of the liver associ\u00adated with mild elevation of the serum liver enzymes, to a broad spectrum of viral infec\u00adtions and the toxic consequences of alcohol and other drug use. The end point of liver disease is liver necrosis or failure. Midway in the progression of liver disease is acute alco\u00ad holic hepatitis . The presentation is one of liver tenderness, jaundice, fever, ascites, and an enlarged liver. The patient is quite sick and frequently has nausea and vomiting. Special considerations Alcoholic hepatitis usually needs acute medi\u00adcal treatment to prevent electrolyte imbalance and dehydration. Protocols may have to be adapted if the patient cannot take oral agents. Portal hypertension Portal hypertension is a frequent conse\u00adquence of liver disease. If elevation of the portal pressure goes untreated, esophageal varices develop and hemorrhage can ensue. Treatment of acute hemorrhage includes endoscopic sclerotherapy or ligation. Initial therapy should include prompt and adequate intravascular volume replacement, correction of severe anemia and coagulopathies, and adequate airway management. Special considerations Propranolol or isosorbide therapy is effective in the prophylaxis of variceal bleeding (Trevillyan and Carroll 1997), though beta blockers can interfere with measuring the true heart rate that determines the content of many detoxification protocols. If bleeding is 124 Chapter 5 present, changeover to intravenous medica\u00ad tion protocols is recommended, as the patient will not be able to take oral medications. Cirrhosis Cirrhosis, or the formation of fibrous tissue in the liver, leads to a state of increased resis\u00adtance in the hepatic venous circulation. The inability of blood to flow freely gives rise to portal hypertension with ensuing esophageal varices, splenomegaly, ascites, dilatation of superficial veins, peripheral edema, and hem\u00adorrhoids. Liver necrosis can be seen in patients who use inhalants, particularly chronic use of benzene and carbon tetrachloride. African Americans and Hispanics/Latinos have higher mortality rates from cirrhosis of the liver resulting from alcohol abuse than do Caucasians and Asians and Pacific Islanders (Sutocky et al. 1993). Liver function test abnormality and jaundice can occur in individuals who use anabolic steroids, but this usually resolves on cessation of the drugs. Studies in the elderly show that 1\u00adyear mortality was 50 percent among patients over age 60 with cirrhosis, versus 7 percent for those under age 60 (Potter and James 1987). Great care needs to be used when giving diuretics to elderly patients with cirrhosis, since their total body water may already be decreased, making them more sus\u00adceptible to fluid and electrolyte depletion (Scott 1989). Alcohol\u00adrelated hepatic injury is seen in a higher proportion of women due to a possible potentiation (strengthening) of this effect by estrogen (Brady and Randall 1999). Special considerations For the treatment of alcohol withdrawal, lorazepam (Ativan) is well tolerated in patients with severe liver disease (D'Onofrio et al. 1999) as is oxazepam (Serax), with its short half\u00adlife of 6 to 8 hours and simple metabolism with no metabolites. Cardiovascular Disorders The presentation of chest pain or discomfort remains one of the most difficult differential diagnoses to sort through, as disorders of sev\u00aderal systems can cause this single complaint. Inability to correctly diagnose this symptom can be brought about by the patient's inabili\u00adty to be interviewed and give succinct symp\u00adtoms (the intoxicated or severely withdrawing patient), a sociocultural or educational level that does not allow for the verbal nuances necessary to making a diagnosis, or fabrica\u00adtion of symptoms by a patient seeking to obtain pain medications or other drugs. A normal resting electrocardiogram does not rule out the presence of organic heart disease and the presence of nonspecific changes does not necessarily mean that heart disease is pre\u00adsent. Final diagnoses can range from reflux to myocardial infarction brought about by underlying ischemic heart disease or the use of cocaine. Frequently, lung diseases can have as their presenting symptom chest discomfort. The consensus panel believes that this condi\u00adtion should never be overlooked or minimized and it is imperative that an especially prompt diagnosis be made and treatment be under\u00adtaken to ensure patient safety. Underlying cardiac illness could be worsened by the presence of autonomic arousal (elevat\u00aded blood pressure, increased pulse and sweat\u00ading) as seen in alcohol, sedative, and opioid withdrawal. Thus prompt attention to these findings and aggressive withdrawal treatment is indicated. Special considerations for the treatment of specific cardiac conditions are outlined below. Hypertension Hypertension frequently is seen in the detoxi\u00adfication patient. Evaluation should include a complete history to determine if the elevated blood pressure predated the present with\u00addrawal status. Consideration should be given to include serum electrolytes, urinalysis, BUN/creatinine, and an EKG in and Psychiatric Conditions 125 cation unit's initial workup. More elaborate workup can be carried out after completion of detoxification. Propranolol (Inderal), labetalol (Trandate) and metoprolol (Lopressor) are the beta blockers of choice for treating hypertension during pregnancy (McElhatton 2001), howev\u00ader, the impact of using them for alcohol detoxification during pregnancy is unclear. If treating African Americans with beta block\u00aders, clinicians should be aware that propra\u00adnolol is less effective in this population than it is in Caucasians (Pi and Gray 1999). Asians require much lower doses of beta blockers than Caucasians, inasmuch as they tend to be very sensitive to the blood pressure and heart rate effects (Pi and Gray 1999). Special considerations The presence of a hypertensive history and poorly controlled blood pressures may have an effect on the proper evaluation of with\u00addrawal as the examiner would have difficulty determining whether the elevated blood pres\u00adsure was due to withdrawal or to the underly\u00ading hypertensive history. Thus modifications of the usual parameters and scheduling of detoxification medications should be consid\u00adered. In any event, severe elevation of blood pressure should be treated concurrently with, at minimum, salt restriction and rest. If the blood pressure is still elevated in several days despite a reduction in other withdrawal parameters and symptoms, then medication is warranted. Beta blockers and clonidine have been used in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal and clonidine also has been used in opioid proto\u00ad cols. These medications can help control blood pressure and also work well in the pro\u00ad tocol. Calcium channel antagonists have also been used to ameliorate some of the symptoms of alcohol withdrawal and can be used con\u00adcurrently for blood pressure control. Ischemic heart disease Ischemic heart disease presents as chest pain or pressure, palpitations, dizziness, and/or shortness of breath and requires immediate attention, which will dictate what setting is appropriate for the detoxification. Cocaine use is associated with various cardio\u00ad vascular complications including angina pec\u00adtoris, myocardial infarction, and sudden death. It is estimated that over half of the 64,000 patients evaluated annually for cocaine\u00adassociated chest pain will be admitted to hospitals for evaluation of myocardial ischemia. Only about 6 percent of patients will demonstrate biochemical evidence of myocardial infarction (Hoffman and Hollander 1997). The typical patient with cocaine\u00adrelated myocardial infarction is a male in his mid\u00ad30s with a history of chronic tobacco and repetitive cocaine use (Hollander 1995). This effect of cocaine appears to be increased because the drug causes an increase in myocardial oxygen demand and thus a decrease in oxygen supply. These two factors, which are caused by vasospasm and vasocon\u00adstriction of the coronary arteries, may lead to cardiovascular disorders. Patients with recent cocaine use can experi\u00ad ence persistent cardiac complications such as prolonged QT interval and vulnerability for arrhythmia and myocardial infarction (Chakko and Myerburg 1995). (QT is the Q to T interval measured on EKGs. If the interval is prolonged, it can lead to cardiac rhythm disturbances.) Amphetamines are rarely reported as the cause of myocardial infarc\u00adtion, though a case report shows that a patient subsequently experienced a non-Q\u00adwave anterior wall infarction associated with amphetamine use (Waksman et al. 2001). Cocaine use and HIV infection have been associated with an increased incidence of car\u00addiac dysfunction, but concomitant exposure may cause a synergistic effect (Soodini and Morgan 2001). 126 Chapter 5 Special considerations Beta\u00adadrenergic blocking agents may exacer\u00ad bate cocaine\u00adinduced reverse cocaine\u00adinduced hypertension and coronary arterial vasoconstriction and are the medications of choice in the patient who uses cocaine and presents with chest pain (Pitts et al. 1999). Cocaine may cause platelet activation leading to acute coronary events\u2014 thus more aggressive antiplatelet therapy may be indicated (Callahan et al. 2001). Cardiomyopathy Cardiomyopathy is caused by degenerative changes of the cardiac muscle with enlarge\u00adment of the heart (cardiomegaly) and left ven\u00adtricular failure. Alcoholic cardiomyopathy presents with a similar picture as cardiac fail\u00adure from other etiologies, with shortness of breath on exertion, shortness of breath when the patient is lying flat, and edema of the lower extremities. Besides alcohol as the etiology, a dilated car\u00addiomyopathy can be seen with use of the inhalant trichlorethylene. Cardiomyopathy in the elderly patient with an already underlying ischemic or atherosclerotic heart disease can be quite debilitating. Women have shown alcohol metabolism different from that of men and distinct pathophysiologic mechanisms, which frequently lead to a higher sensitivity to alcohol\u00adinduced heart damage. The preva\u00ad lence of cardiomyopathy in women is equal to that in men, despite cases in which women have consumed far less ethanol (Fernandez\u00ad Sola and Nicolas\u00adArfelis 2002). Special considerations Alcoholic cardiomyopathy may respond poor\u00ad ly to digitalis with increased likelihood of digi\u00ad talis toxicity (Zakhari 1991). Arrhythmias Arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats) can be seen in the presence of ischemia and car\u00addiomyopathy. Two specific cases of arrhyth\u00admogenic disorders are \"holiday heart,\" where the patient who has ingested alcohol presents with supraventricular arrhythmia (Greenspon and Schaal 1983), and the indi\u00advidual who uses cocaine with the stimulant leading to significant atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. Consumption of anabolic steroids also has been associated with hypertension, Cocaine use is associated with various cardiovascular complications including angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, and sudden death. ischemic heart and arrhythmia(Sullivan et al. 1999). Special consider\u00ad ations Treatment of arrhyth\u00ad mia in the person who abuses substances is similar to that for the patient who does not abuse substances, though the setting of detoxification may have to be altered to allow for cardiac monitoring (teleme\u00ad try). Hematologic Disorders Hematologic (blood) disorders can be seen due to several factors, such as a direct toxic effect of the drug on the bone marrow, as seen in alcohol and benzene use, or as a result of mal\u00ad absorption of essential nutrients (B12, folate), or as a general poor state of nutrition. Co\u00adOccurring Medical and Psychiatric Conditions 127 Anemia Anemia can be seen due to folate deficiency, iron deficiency, B12 deficiency, acute blood loss, or more frequently as a combination of factors. Folate deficiency can cause a mega\u00ad loblastic anemia, which is diagnosed by macroovalocytes and hypersegmented neu\u00adtrophils seen on a peripheral blood smear. Iron deficiency anemia results from blood loss and thus subsequent iron loss. This can be seen in low\u00adlevel gastrointestinal bleeding, after childbirth, and as a result of menstrual Traumatic brain injury (TBI) should always be considered in patients with neurological impairment. blood loss. The pre\u00adsentation of anemia usually is nonde\u00adscript with general\u00adized fatigue and weakness. With severe anemia, shortness of breath on exertion and an elevated heart rate can be seen. Specific to the megaloblastic ane\u00admias (B12 and folate deficiency) one can see neuro\u00adlogic complications such as peripheral neuropathy. White blood cell disorders White blood cell disorders can occur due to malnutrition and liver disease. Lymphopenia may be present in the patient with HIV disease. Platelet disorders Platelet disorders frequently are attributable to the direct effect on the bone marrow by the substance being abused or, as seen in alcohol\u00ad related thrombocytopenia, are due to bone marrow suppression. Splenomegaly caused by portal hypertension also can cause a low platelet count (thrombocytopenia), which is due to enlargement of the spleen and abnor\u00admally high platelet storage. Thrombocyto\u00adpenia also can be seen in cases of vitamin B12 and folate deficiency. The African\u00adAmerican patient with sickle cell disease or trait can be severely affected (inas\u00admuch as the patient already has an impaired oxygen delivery system) if other harm threat\u00adens the bone marrow. Special considerations Elevated heart rates can hinder the use of the heart rate as a parameter in various detoxifica\u00ad tion protocols. Pulmonary Disorders (Other Than Infectious) Pulmonary disorders are common in people who abuse substances, in part because of the high rate of nicotine use in this population (Graham et al. 2003). Aspiration pneumonia Alcohol or other drug ingestion may reduce a patient's gag reflex, leading to the blockage of the airways. Aspiration pneumonia occurs when oro\u00adpharyngeal secretions and/or gastric contents enter into the lower airways. This seri\u00ad ous condition may require prolonged hospital\u00ad ization. Asthma Asthma, a chronic condition characterized by exacerbations of bronchial spasm manifested by wheezing, should be differentiated from bronchospasm, which is related to inhaled drugs and usually is self\u00adlimited. Treatment is similar to that provided to patients who do not use substances, with the addition of cessa\u00adtion of the substance use. The patient with underlying chronic asthma can be severely compromised if the use of a smokeable drug causes exacerbation of an already impaired system. 128 Chapter 5 Special considerations Asthma medications can cause a significant increase in heart rate, which can affect the evaluation of withdrawal protocols that use heart rate as one of the parameters. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (emphysema, chronic bronchitis) fre\u00ad quently is due to cigarette use and the result\u00ading alterations of the pulmonary immune sys\u00adtem, inflammation, and destruction of lung parenchyma. Presentation includes shortness of breath on exertion, a cough producing mucous, and wheezing. African Americans who smoke cigarettes take in more nicotine, and therefore more tobacco smoke toxins per cigarette, than Caucasians (Perez\u00adStable et al. 1998). Daily marijuana smoking has been shown to have adverse effects on lung function includ\u00ading a productive cough, wheezing, and exces\u00adsive sputum production. However, the habitu\u00adal marijuana\u00adonly smoker, in the absence of alpha\u00ad1\u00adantitrypsin deficiency, would have to smoke four to five marijuana cigarettes per day for a span of at least 30 years to develop overt manifestations of COPD (Van Hoozen and Cross 1997). Special considerations During nicotine withdrawal and cessation treatment, different levels of nicotine absorp\u00adtion, as seen in some groups, will affect dosing for nicotine replacement therapies (Perez\u00ad Stable et al. 1998). The patient with COPD, especially if elderly, would be sensitive to the sedating effects of many of the detoxification protocol medications, especially the benzodi\u00ad azepines, which may have to be reduced in dosage to avoid respiratory depression and worsening hypoxemia and hypercarbia (decrease in oxygen and increase in carbon dioxide). For smokers, always consider the use of the nicotine replacement agents, partic\u00adularly in hospitalized patients. Evaluation for infections and the use of oxygen, steroids, and inhalers is dictated by the clinical pic\u00adture. During detoxification, if nicotine use is not allowed, there can be significant effects on drug levels (see chapter 4). Neurologic System The neurologic system of patients with sub\u00adstance use disorders is affected directly in the toxic effects on cell membranes, effects on neurotransmitters, associated metabolic changes from other underlying disorders, and changes in blood flow. Researchers have found that the majority of those with an alco\u00adhol use disorder (75 percent) have some degree of cognitive impairment (Goldstein 1987). Specific disorders found in patients with substance use disorders can affect the central nervous system and the peripheral system. For example, a broad array of neu\u00adropathologic changes are seen in the brains of people who use heroin. The main findings are due to infections as a result of endocarditis or HIV infection. Other complications include hypoxic\u00adischemic changes with cerebral edema, ischemic neuronal damage thought to be due to heroin\u00adinduced respiratory depres\u00adsion, stroke due to thromboembolism, vas\u00adculitis, septic emboli, and hypotension. Myelopathy occurs as a result of possible iso\u00adlated vascular accident in the spinal cord, and a distinct condition, leukoencephalopa\u00adthy, has been described after the inhalation of pre\u00adheated heroin (Buttner et al. 2000). As a final note, traumatic brain injury (TBI) should always be considered in patients pre\u00adsenting with neurological impairment. People who abuse substances are at high risk of falls, motor vehicle accidents, gang violence, domestic violence, etc., which may result in head injury (Graham et al. 2003). Unrecognized TBI can affect the treatment outcome. Co\u00adOccurring Medical and Psychiatric Conditions 129 Wernicke\u00adKorsakoff's Syndrome Wernicke\u00adKorsakoff's Syndrome is composed of Wernicke's encephalopathy and Korsakoff's psychosis. Wernicke's encephalopathy is an acute neurological dis\u00adorder with a triad of Oculomotor dysfunction (bilateral abducens nerve palsy\u2014eye muscle paralysis) Ataxia (loss of muscle coordination) Confusion Weakness and nystagmus are also seen in this syndrome on examination of the eyes. Wernicke's encephalopathy is clearly related to thiamine deficiency. Korsakoff's psychosis is a chronic neurologi\u00ad cal condition resulting from thiamine defi\u00adciency that includes retrograde and antegrade amnesia (profound deficit in new learning and remote memory) with confabulation (patients make up stories to cover memory gaps). Special considerations Thiamine initially is given parenterally and then oral administration is the treatment of choice. Always give thiamine prior to glucose administration. Alcohol and sedative withdrawal seizures Alcohol and sedative withdrawal seizures rep\u00ad resent a significant medical challenge (Ahmed et al. 2000), since no large clinical studies have been conducted to firmly establish the best treatment practices. Up to 90 percent of alcohol withdrawal seizures occur in the first 48 hours and usually are single and nonfocal. Repeated episodes of drinking and withdraw\u00ad al are thought to predispose people to seizures due to a kindling phenomenon (Post et al. 1987). Patients with a history of with\u00addrawal seizures are at greatest risk and should receive prophylactic doses of a long\u00ad acting benzodiazepine (e.g., chlordiazepoxide 50mg every 6 hours for 24 hours) when detox\u00adifying from alcohol. Individuals with an alcohol use disorder show an increase in seizures due to withdrawal, metabolic insults such as hypoglycemia or electrolyte imbalance, or head trauma. In one study, researchers found that of 195 cases of seizures in those with an alcohol use disorder, 59 percent were due to alcohol withdrawal, 20 percent to head trauma, and 5 percent to vas\u00adcular disorders (Earnest et al. 1988). Special considerations Evaluation of a first seizure should include a neurological evaluation and evaluation for head trauma. Metabolic etiologies, such as low magnesium levels, should be considered. Mayo\u00adSmith (1997) has shown that benzodi\u00adazepines confer protection against alcohol withdrawal seizures and thus patients with previous seizures should be treated early with this class of medications. The consensus panel suggests that anti\u00adepileptic drug therapy should be considered in alcohol withdrawal patients with multiple past seizures (of any cause), a history of recent head injury, past meningitis, encephalitis, or a family history of seizures. Clinicians should be aware that treatment of the first seizure with benzodiazepines does not prevent the likelihood of a second seizure (D'Onofrio et al. 1999). Slower medication tapers should be considered when this condi\u00adtion co\u00adoccurs with detoxification. Lorazepam, which can be used in patients with liver disease, has been suggested as appropriate, but it and other short\u00adacting benzodiazepines may not prevent late\u00adoccur\u00adring withdrawal seizures (Shaw 1995). Dosages of anticonvulsant medications should be stabilized before sedative\u00adhypnotic with\u00addrawal begins. Adequate treatment with a long\u00adacting benzodiazepine is effective in pre\u00adventing withdrawal seizures (Mayo\u00adSmith and Bernard 1995). D'Onofrio and colleagues (1999) found that a one\u00adtime dose of the rela\u00ad 130 Chapter 5 tively shorter acting agent lorazepam also reduced the risk of a subsequent seizure com\u00adpared to placebo. However, in D'Onofrio's study doses were small and the results were limited somewhat by use in an emergency room setting. Older, first\u00adgeneration anticonvulsants have limitations in that they have only been stud\u00adied in mild to moderate withdrawal, on rare occasions they can cause serious hepatic and bone marrow toxicities, and they can interact with other classes of medication. Newer drugs, such as gabapentin (Neurontin) and oxcarbazepine (Trileptal), do not appear to have these liabilities, but sufficient studies to show this have not yet been done. There is lit\u00adtle evidence that long\u00adterm use of phenytoin is helpful in the patient who does not have an underlying seizure disorder (Kasser et al. 2000). Medications that may lower the seizure threshold, including phenothiazines, such as prochlorperazine (Compazine), and several antidepressants, such as bupropion, should be used with great caution in the patient with a seizure history. The use of anticonvulsants, such as valproic acid and barbiturates, has been studied in pregnant women. Valproic acid is associated with several malformations in the fetus. The use of any anticonvulsant medication should be discussed with the pregnant patient and risks and benefits explained (Robert et al. 2001). Cerebrovascular accidents Cerebrovascular accident (stroke) can be seen in alcohol and cocaine use, coagulation impair\u00ad ment, and severe uncontrolled hypertension. Patients with recent cocaine/amphetamine use may present with headaches, which could represent subarachnoid and/or intracerebral bleed, and therefore should be appropriately evaluated (Buxton and McConachie 2000). Heavy alcohol consumption increases the risk for all major types of stroke by a variety of mechanisms (Hillbom and Numminen 1998). There is a higher than normal incidence of hemorrhagic stroke and other intracranial bleeding among patients with heavy alcohol use, and a particular association of strokes within 24 hours of a drinking binge (Altura 1986). Special considerations Nifedipine and verapamil have been shown to prevent alcohol\u00adinduced vasospasm, which sug\u00ad gests a possible therapeutic approach to hyper\u00ad tension and stroke in the patient with heavy alcohol use (Altura 1986). Polyneu\u00ad ropathy Polyneuropathy fre\u00ad quently is seen in nutritional deficien\u00ad Treatment of the first seizure with benzodiazepines does not prevent the likelihood of a second seizure. cies that occur in the patient with chronic alcohol use. Presenting signs and symptoms include lower extremity pain, distal motor loss, numbness or tingling, and loss of reflexes. Polyneuropathy can be seen in the inhalation of a toxic brain syn\u00ad drome that results from the accumulation of unmetabolized nitrogenous waste products in a patient with severe liver dysfunction. Presenting signs and symptoms include an alteration in consciousness and behavior, fluctuating neurologic signs such as a flapping tremor (asterixis), and an elevated serum ammonia level. Clinicians should evaluate Co\u00adOccurring Medical and Psychiatric Conditions 131 patients for precipitating causes, which include the following: GI hemorrhage Electrolyte imbalance (metabolic alkalosis) Infections Excessive diuresis (dehydration) Use of sedatives Increase of dietary protein intake Those patients who are infected with Helicobacter pylori may be more prone to hepatic encephalopathy (Duseja et al. 2003). Special considerations Clinicians should avoid the use of diuretics, identify and treat factors that may have pre\u00ad cipitated the encephalopathy, Immuno\u00ad compromised patients may not react to the tuberculin skin tests. decrease dietary protein intake, and use Lactulose to decrease nitroge\u00adnous waste prod\u00aducts via the GI tract. Protocols that use the benzo\u00addiazepines should be adjusted to use those specific medi\u00adcations that are hepatically metabo\u00adlized minimally or not at all. Infectious Diseases The viral causes of hepatitis are multiple, though the hepatitis B and C viruses are the predominant causative agents. Hepatitis C virus infection appears to be the most com\u00admon form of infectious hepatitis in patients with substance use disorders. At least 76 per\u00adcent of patients who have used injection drugs for less than 7 years are positive for hepatitis C, while 25 percent of patients with alcohol use disorders and those who do not inject drugs show serologic evidence of infection (Fingerhood et al. 1993; National Institute on Drug Abuse 2000). Hepatitis B infections are likely to present more often as a chronic infection than as an acute\u00adstage phenomenon. Testing for chronic hepatitis B and C infec\u00adtion is appropriate during the detoxification period. Special considerations Followup for hepatitis B and C should be arranged for after discharge from the detoxi\u00adfication setting. Vaccination is recommended for hepatitis A and B in the patient with hep\u00adatitis C. The vaccination schedule is over a 6\u00admonth period, so it needs to be done after the detoxification program. If significant liver disease is present, use of shorter\u00adacting medi\u00adcation with less liver metabolism should be considered. For more on infectious disease and substance abuse, see TIP 6, Screening for Infectious Diseases Among Substance Abusers (CSAT 1993c). Endocarditis Endocarditis is caused by the introduction of various bacterial species into the vascular system when the protective defense mecha\u00adnisms of the skin are bypassed through injec\u00adtion. The patient frequently will present with fever, cardiac murmur, anemia, enlargement of the spleen, petechiae, and peripheral embolic disease. The course can be subtle and indolent to fulminant, and if untreated can lead to a poor prognosis. In the patient who uses drugs intravenously, the tricuspid valve is affected in 70 percent of cases, followed by effects on the aortic valve and the mitral valve. Seventy\u00adfive percent of all cases are caused by Staphylococcus aureus and up to 15 percent are caused by gram negative aero\u00adbic bacilli (Aragon and Sande 1994). Endocarditis always should be suspected in the febrile patient who uses intravenous drugs. Patients who use drugs intravenously are 300 times more likely to die suddenly from infectious endocarditis than patients who use drugs nonintravenously (Burke et al. 1997). Patients who use cocaine intravenously 132 Chapter 5 may have a higher rate of endocarditis as a result of more frequent injections and the reduced need to solubilize cocaine solutions with heat (Chambers et al. 1987). Bacterial pneumonia Bacterial pneumonia can result from immune system dysfunction, interference with normal respiratory defense mechanisms (from alcohol or smoked drugs), direct toxicity, or aspiration. The treating physician should be aware that the usual pathogens found in community\u00adacquired pneumonia (i.e., Streptococcus pneumoniae) may not be the causative agent in pneumonias patients dependent influenzae , Klebsiella pneumoniae, and other gram\u00adnegative microorganisms must be suspected and treat\u00adment given until definitive culture results are reported. Among patients who use parenteral drugs, pneumonia is the most common reason for admission to the hospital, accounting for 38 percent of all hospitalizations in this popu\u00adlation (Marantz et al. 1987). Special considerations Careful use of respiratory depressants is rec\u00ad ommended. Indications for hospitalization of the patient with pneumonia (Neu 1994) include the following: Old age Dehydration Vomiting and inability to take in oral fluids and medications Multilobar disease Low white blood cell count Respiratory acidosis pO2 less than 55 mm Hg Significant concomitant diseases HIV Tuberculosis Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by acid\u00adfast rod ( Mycobacterium tuberculosis ). Transmission is by droplets spread through the air. The infected patient presents with complaints of cough (most common finding), bloody spu\u00adtum, chest pain, fever, and weight loss. Recent immigrants from countries where TB is prevalent, socioeconomically disadvantaged populations, homeless persons, people who use illicit drugs, incarcerated people, and people who live in areas where infection with HIV is prevalent, are at increased risk for this disease and should be tested. Further\u00admore, new strains of multidrug\u00adresistant TB are appearing, especially among the homeless population (Borgdorff et al. 2000; Moss et al. 2000). TB is endemic in many areas of the world (Asia, Africa, and South and Central America) (Gupta et al. 2004). As a public health concern, testing all patients is of the utmost importance, even more so for patients from regions where TB is endemic. It is important to remember that immunocompro\u00admised patients may not react to the skin tests (anergy). Diagnosis is made with tuberculin skin testing, sputum smears and cultures, and radiographic findings. For more information on dealing with tuberculosis in detoxification and treatment settings see TIP 18, The Tuberculosis Epidemic: Legal and Ethical Issues for Alcohol and Other Drug Abuse Treatment Providers (CSAT 1995i). Skin infections Skin infections frequently are seen as a result of the intravenous administration of drugs. Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes are frequently the infectious agents. The patient presents with tenderness, swelling, pain, erythema, and warmth in the injection area. The type and route of antibi\u00adotic is determined by the infecting organism and the extent and severity of the infection. Clinicians should remember that injection sites can be found virtually any place on the body where there is access to the venous sys\u00adtem. Patients who use drugs intravenously, patients with peripheral vascular disease, and Co\u00adOccurring Medical and Psychiatric Conditions 133 patients with diabetes (particularly with infections of the feet) should all be evaluated carefully for skin disease. Sexually transmitted diseases Sexually transmitted diseases can be seen in the form of urethritis, vaginitis, cervicitis, and gen\u00ad ital lesions. These disorders are caused by a variety of microorganisms, and a complete his\u00ad tory and physical that includes examination of the genitalia is indicated in all patients. The clinical picture and cultures frequently can guide the treatment protocols. Patients who use drugs intravenously occasionally display a false\u00adpositive serologic test for syphilis, possibly due to a nonspecific reaction to repeated expo\u00ad sure of injected antigens (Hook 1992). HIV/AIDS HIV/AIDS is a serious and prevalent medical condition among persons with substance use disorders, especially those who inject drugs and may share needles with other users. Patients with AIDS can present with a spec\u00adtrum of complaints and illnesses ranging from an asymptomatic history to complaints of fever, enlargement of the lymph nodes, diffi\u00adculty swallowing, diarrhea, weight loss, skin lesions, shortness of breath (due to Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia), headaches (due to Toxoplasma gondii ), seizures, and dementia. As a rule of thumb, no complaint in the patient infected with HIV should be dismissed as irrelevant. Gay men and patients who use drugs intra\u00ad venously may be at higher risk for HIV/AIDS than other groups; thus, testing or referral for testing should be done and appropriate counseling offered. All such patients should be tested for HIV/AIDS or referred for test\u00ad ing. Some States, such as Colorado, require that a risk assessment be administered to all clients and that clients be advised of their risk and referred for testing if they are at risk for HIV/AIDS. Patients who decline HIV test\u00ading still should be educated about the risk and prevention. Due to increased virulence of syphilis in patients who are HIV positive, as well as increased resistance to the treatments indicat\u00aded in the usual treatment protocols, all such patients should be tested for syphilis and all patients who test positive for syphilis should be sent for HIV testing (McNeil et al. 2004). Special considerations If methadone is being used in withdrawal pro\u00ad tocols, or maintenance is being continued, the clinician should be aware that certain HIV medications can cause an increased metabolism of methadone: Efavirenz (Sustiva) bacterial infection, in HIV\u00adpositive clients) Amprenavir (Agenerase) Abacavir Ritonavir TIP 37, With HIV/AIDS (CSAT 2000e) pro\u00ad vides further information about substance abuse treatment for patients with HIV/AIDS. Other Conditions Cancer Cancer occurrence is increased in people with substance use disorders due to the carcino\u00adgenicity of the drugs used. Cigarette smoking is linked to lung, larynx, oral cavity, esopha\u00adgus, stomach, bladder, and pancreatic can\u00adcer. Heavy alcohol consumption is associated with an increased incidence of oral, pharyn\u00adgeal, esophageal, laryngeal, respiratory tract, and breast cancer (Polednak 2005). Synergism is seen with alcohol and smoking being associated with even higher risks of cancer (Fagerstrom 2002). A history of weight 134 Chapter 5 loss could suggest many chronic diseases, though cancer should be considered in the differential. There may be an increase in head and neck cancers in persons with heavy cannabis use (Donald 1991). Liver cancer may be seen in patients with hepatitis C and those using anabolic steroids (Socas et al. 2005). There is a particular interrelationship among alcohol intake, hepatitis C, and hepa\u00adtocellular carcinoma (Yoshihara et al. 1998). Diabetes Patients who use drugs intravenously may experience infections that affect diabetic con\u00ad trol, though any infection in any detoxification patient needs to be addressed both from an infectious disease and diabetic viewpoint. Special considerations Several medications can lead to impaired glu\u00ad cose tolerance and an elevated serum glucose (Garber 1994). Some examples include may produce hypoglycemia and lactic acidosis. Diabetes mellitus also is seen in patients who present with new\u00adonset hyperglycemia (elevated glucose) or with a history of diabetes and poor control. Acute trauma/fractures Acute trauma/fractures can be seen in any patient with a substance use disorder due to an altered level of consciousness or impaired gait when intoxicated. Patients with substance use disorders appear to be particularly prone to accidents of all kinds, with a spectrum of com\u00ad plications from head trauma to falls with frac\u00ad tures. Chronic pain frequently is seen in patients as a result of trauma (treated or untreated), poor health maintenance, or an inability to deal with pain without drug use. Chronic pain treatment and the issues of opioid use have to be considered for each patient on an individual basis. The surgeon should consider drug with\u00addrawal in the differ\u00adential diagnosis of any physical or neu\u00adrologic symptoms or Certain HIV medications can cause an increased metabolism of methadone. signs that emerge during the perioper\u00adative period. There is a two\u00ad to threefold increase in postoper\u00adative morbidity in patients with alcohol use disorders, the most frequent com\u00ad plications being infections, bleeding, cardiopulmonary insufficiency, and withdrawal compli\u00ad cations (Tonnesen and Kehlet 1999). Special considerations Opioids may be used to control pain in the ini\u00ad tial period of trauma. Detoxification protocols should be started prior to anticipated surgery and continued throughout the perioperative period. Pain that causes an increased heart rate, as well as postoperative temperature ele\u00ad vation, may impact the detoxification parame\u00ad ters. Due to tolerance to opioids, the daily methadone dose in a methadone\u00admaintained individual will not serve as an analgesic for pain relief from surgical or other illnesses. Full therapeutic doses of analgesic drugs should be given to methadone\u00admaintained Co\u00adOccurring Medical and Psychiatric Conditions 135 patients who have co\u00adoccurring painful condi\u00ad tions (CSAT 2005 d; Ho and Dole 1979). Since most medications for pain management are drugs with a high abuse potential, pro\u00adgrams may need to alter their policies regard\u00ading the use of such drugs. Pain patients do not require detoxification from prescribed medications unless they meet the criteria for opioid abuse or dependence described in the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition . Treatments for pain include physical therapy, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, and therapeutic heat and cold. Trials of nons\u00adteroidal anti\u00adinflam\u00admatory agents or nerve block should The effects of drug toxicity and withdrawal often can mimic psychiatric disorders. be considered prior to the use of highly addictive and abus\u00adable medications. The use of acetaminophen in the patient with an alcohol use disorder always has been questioned, espe\u00adcially if there is evi\u00addence of liver dis\u00adease. However, a review article of the medical literature showed that repeat\u00ad ed ingestion of a therapeutic dose of acetaminophen over 48 hours by patients with severe alcoholism did not produce an increase in hepatic aminotransferase enzyme levels or any clinical manifestations as compared to a placebo group (Dart et al. 2000). Treatment of Co\u00adOccurring Psychiatric Conditions Pharmacological agents can be used as indi\u00ad cated for co\u00adoccurring psychiatric conditions in patients with substance use disorders. Incidence of the co\u00adoccurrence of psychiatric conditions and substance use disorders is high; moreover, there is a higher rate of psy\u00adchiatric conditions in patients dependent on alcohol than that found in the general popula\u00adtion (Kessler et al. 2003; Modesto\u00adLowe and Kranzler 1999). Comorbidity of substance use and co\u00adoccur\u00adring mental disorders serves to complicate diagnosis and treatment for patients (Salloum and Thase 2000). It is difficult to accurately access underlying psychopathology in a per\u00adson undergoing detoxification. The effects of drug toxicity and withdrawal often can mimic psychiatric disorders. For this reason, it may be best to conduct psychiatric evaluations after several weeks of abstinence; however, this should be weighed against the time an individual has been in detoxification and what treatment plan is set up for him. Some patients also present to detoxification while taking medications to treat underlying psychi\u00adatric disorders, such as depression and anxi\u00adety. The risk of not treating a severe comor\u00adbid psychiatric disorder predisposes the patient to relapse; the decision needs to be weighed against the risk of prescribing medi\u00adcations when the clinician is not entirely cer\u00adtain that a comorbid condition exists. If a period of recent extended abstinence exists, the patient's mental condition when abstinent can be better evaluated. Although it is the philosophy of some physi\u00adcians to discontinue all psychiatric medica\u00adtions upon entering a detoxification program, this course of action is not always in the best interest of the patient. Abrupt cessation of psychotherapeutic medications may cause withdrawal symptoms or the re\u00ademergence of the psychiatric disorder. As a general rule, 136 Chapter 5 therapeutic doses of medications should be continued through any withdrawal if the patient has been taking the medication as pre\u00adscribed. Decisions about discontinuing medi\u00adcations should be deferred until after the individual has completed detoxification. If, however, the patient has been abusing a medi\u00adcation or the psychiatric symptoms were clearly caused by substance abuse, then the rationale for discontinuing the medication is strengthened. Finally, practitioners should consider withholding medications that lower the seizure threshold (e.g., bupropion or con\u00adventional antipsychotics) during the acute alcohol withdrawal period, or at a minimum prescribing a loading dose or scheduled taper of benzodiazepine. During detoxification, some patients decom\u00ad pensate and lapse into psychosis, depression, or severe anxiety. In such cases, careful observation of the withdrawal medication reg\u00adimen is of paramount importance. If the decompensation is a result of inadequate dos\u00ading with withdrawal medication, the appro\u00adpriate response is to increase the dose of med\u00adication. If it appears that the withdrawal medication is adequate, other medications may be needed. Before choosing such an alternative, it is important to take into account additional considerations, such as the side effects of the added medication and the possibility of interaction with the withdrawal medication. A patient with psychosis may need to take neuroleptics. Medications that have a minimal effect on the seizure threshold are recom\u00ad mended, particularly if the patient is being withdrawn from alcohol or benzodiazepines. Small, frequent doses of Haldol, such as 1mg every 2 hours, may be used until the patient's symptoms of psychosis begin to disappear. The case for emergency use of antidepres\u00ad sants is weaker than for other psychiatric medications because of the 2\u00ad to 3\u00adweek lag time between initiation of medication and therapeutic response. After detoxification, the patient's need for medication should be reassessed. A trial without medications some\u00adtimes is the best way to assess the patient's need for the medication; however, it may not be the best practice or in the best interest of the patient, particularly for those with a seri\u00adous mental illness. For more information on working with patients with co\u00adoccurring sub\u00adstance use and mental disorders, see TIP 42, Substance Abuse Treatment for Persons With Co\u00adOccurring Disorders (CSAT 2005c). Treatment for Co\u00adOccurring Conditions The treatment of substance use disorders can be difficult without adequate treatment of any co\u00adoccurring mental disorders. For instance, a patient with schizophrenia who is halluci\u00adnating and delusional, but who also abuses substances, cannot participate in substance abuse treatment without adequate control over the psychosis. Likewise, patients with mania who are euphoric and delusional, patients who are depressed, or patients with agoraphobia who also have a substance use disorder, will have difficulty cooperating with substance abuse treatment. Treatment of the substance use disorder is necessary to improve the course of both the substance abuse and co\u00adoccurring mental disorder. Psychotherapy should serve as one aspect of rehabilitation, initially focused around relapse prevention (Aviram et al. 2001). Highly effective treatment programs may include a combination of therapeutic tech\u00adniques. Programs should be long\u00adterm and approach recovery in stages. Drake and col\u00adleagues (2001) suggest that treatment for co\u00adoccurring substance use and other mental dis\u00adorders include skill building, illness manage\u00adment, cultural sensitivity, and support to patients for the pursuit of practical goals. Limitations of pharmacologi\u00ad cal agents in persons with substance dependence Pharmacologic agents have limitations in the population of persons with substance use dis\u00ad Co\u00adOccurring Medical and Psychiatric Conditions 137 orders. Medications may impair cognition and blunt feelings, sometimes subtly. Clinicians treating substance use disorders advocate that clients need clear thinking and access to emotions in order to make fundamental changes in themselves. A person recovering from a substance use disorder must take an active part in changing attitudes and aban\u00addoning a long\u00adheld belief that alcohol or other drugs can \"treat\" life problems and uncom\u00ad fortable psychological states. Although these are potential risks, the intent of pharma\u00adcotherapy is to enhance a person's ability to sustain abstinence and benefit fully from con\u00adcurrent psychosocial interventions and treat\u00adments. Still, many psychiatric disorders, if untreated, result in mood, anxiety, or thought disorders that prevent or retard the behav\u00adioral changes necessary to recover from sub\u00adstance use disorders. Risks versus benefits of pharmacological agents need to be considered carefully. Untreated anxiety, mood, or thought disor\u00adders can be powerful relapse triggers, espe\u00adcially for people with a long\u00adstanding pattern of relying on alcohol or other drugs to man\u00adage their symptoms. In many instances, the benefits and reduced relapse risk that appro\u00adpriate pharmacotherapy can provide far out\u00adweighs the risk of taking medications. Some clinicians believe that the \"no pain, no gain\" approach has far greater risk of interfering with recovery than of promoting it. Symptoms such as anxiety and depression in persons recovering from substance use disorders might be vital to recovery, and pharma\u00ad cotherapy to treat such symptoms needs to be considered carefully in this context. Clinically, anxiety and depression can pro\u00ad vide the motivation to change when the patient otherwise has little awareness of the need to alter behavior. Standard of Care for Co\u00adOccurring Psychiatric Conditions After detoxification and stabilization with pharmacologic agents, the current treatment of choice for substance use disorders is non\u00adpharmacologic. Further, several studies have shown that treating substance use disorders with abstinence alone results in improvement of the psychiatric syndromes associated with the substance use (Anderson and Kiefer 2004). Severe syndromes induced by alcohol that may otherwise meet criteria for major depressive and anxiety disorders are best classified as substance\u00adinduced disorders if they resolve within days to weeks with absti\u00adnence. Likewise, manic syndromes induced by cocaine resolve within hours to days, and schizophrenia\u00adlike syndromes (e.g., hallucina\u00adtions and delusions) induced by cocaine and PCP often resolve within days to weeks with abstinence. Further studies are needed to confirm the clinical experience that psychiatric symptoms (including anxiety, depression, and personali\u00adty disorders) respond to specific treatment of the addiction. For example, cognitive-behav\u00adioral techniques employed in the 12\u00adStep treatment approach have been effective in the management of anxiety and depression associ\u00adated with addiction. Although challenging, treatment of both addiction and co\u00adoccurring psychiatric conditions has proven cost\u00adeffec\u00adtive in some studies (Goldsmith 1999). Psychotropics for Co\u00adOccurring Psychiatric Conditions General aspects Because alcohol and other drugs can induce almost any psychiatric symptom or sign or mimic any psychiatric disorder, their effects always must be considered before a co\u00adoccur\u00ad ring condition diagnosis is established or treated. 138 Chapter 5 With an understanding of the interactions between substance use and other mental dis\u00adorders, a rational approach can be applied to the use of pharmacologic therapies in co\u00adoccurring conditions. The use of medications for psychiatric symptoms should begin only after the knowledge of the natural history of the addictive disorder and other psychiatric disorders is clarified. Further, it is important to be able to identify the respective roles of substance use and other mental disorders in the generation of psychiatric symptoms. Generally, substance\u00adinduced psychiatric symptoms resolve within days to weeks of abstinence. In many studies, the prevalence rates for anxiety and affective disorders in persons dependent on alcohol were not greater than those for persons not dependent on alcohol (Schneider et al. 2001). A retrospective history of psychiatric symp\u00adtoms often can lead to an inflated diagnosis of these conditions because of rationalizations regarding drinking and drug use by the indi\u00advidual. Typically, psychiatric symptoms are emphasized by both the patient and the psy\u00adchiatric examiner. Longitudinal observation frequently clarifies the role of alcohol and other drugs in the pro\u00adduction of anxiety, affective, psychotic, or personality symptoms, particularly if objec\u00adtive criteria are relied on in addition to the subjective report of the person who is addict\u00aded. Also, specific treatment of substance use disorders can result in improvement of mood, psychotic behavior, and personality distur\u00adbances if related to the alcohol or other drug use. Mood lability and personality states can be a manifestation of substance use disorders, and treatment of the addictive disorder can lead to stabilization of these psychiatric symptoms. Furthermore, treatment plans and efficacy may rely on the gender of the patient. Women with a substance use disorder appear to have higher rates of co\u00adoccurring mental disorders, such as depression and anxiety, as well as higher rates of physical and sexual abuse, panic and phobia disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, victimization, and eating dis\u00adorders. Deficits in the management of mood disturbances may be self\u00admedicated through alcohol consumption in females. It has been proposed that the outcomes of substance abuse in women are different when compared to those of men. For these reasons, the effica\u00adcy of treatment for substance use disorders needs to be assessed independently for both genders (Becker and Walton\u00adMoss 2001; Brady and Randall 1999). Anxiety Disorders Major depressive and anxiety disorders are best classified as substance\u00adinduced disorders if they resolve within days to weeks with abstinence. General approach Prevalence rates for the co\u00adoccurrence of anxiety and sub\u00adstance use disorders in the general popu\u00adlation range from 5 to 20 percent in epi\u00addemiologic and clini\u00adcal studies (Merikangas et al. 1996). Some antianxiety agents can overse\u00addate and dull the individual's reaction to internal and external influences. Because anxiety in recovery can be critically impor\u00adtant for emotional growth, the individual will feel a certain amount of anxiety to motivate change in behavior, attitudes, and emotions. (The expression \"emotional growth\" is related to the anxiety or discomfort a recovering indi\u00advidual feels while undergoing the process of change to reach a more mature state.) It is important for the clinician to distinguish between anxiety that can promote growth and anxiety that can impair a person's ability to make change. Adapting behavior in response to anxiety or other emotion requires coping Co\u00adOccurring Medical and Psychiatric Conditions 139 skills that may not be available to persons in early recovery. A fully symptomatic anxiety disorder may significantly limit a person's capacity to learn nonpharmacological coping strategies. Medications with minimal addic\u00adtion potential can be helpful and in some cases necessary if patients are to make progress in their recovery. Depressants (e.g., alcohol) can produce anxi\u00adety during withdrawal, and stimulants (e.g., cocaine) can produce anxiety during intoxica\u00adtion. Because people with substance use dis\u00adorders are in a relatively constant state of withdrawal (it is impossible to main\u00adtain a constant blood level), they regularly experi\u00ad Medication is indicated when the anxiety is preventing the patient from participating in treatment. ence anxiety as the result of pharmaco\u00adlogical withdrawal from dependence. As the substance abuse becomes more chronic, the anxiety produced by withdrawal from pharmacologic dependence can become increasingly severe. Relapse and/or periods of abstinence (some\u00adtimes prolonged\u2014 for weeks or months) should be considered (confirm abstinence with laboratory drug testing, if necessary) before the effects of depressant or stimulant drugs in inducing anxiety can be ruled out. It can take weeks or months for these effects to subside completely, although a period of only a few days to weeks often is sufficient in clinical practice. Treatment is indicated when the anxiety per\u00ad sists after adequate effort in a substance abuse treatment program, or when the clini\u00ad cian suspects that anxiety is preventing the patient from participating in treatment. A thorough evaluation to assess whether the individual is abstinent, involved in continuing treatment, and/or attending self\u00adhelp meetings usually is necessary before a diagnosis of a co\u00adoccurring psychiatric condition can be def\u00adinitely established. After such an evaluation, treatment of the anxiety disorder can proceed separately from similar symptoms arising from the addictive disorder. Pharmacologic therapies The ideal medication works against abnormal anxiety but not against the \"normal\" anxiety needed for recovery. Some of the physical symptoms of anxiety include sweating, tremors, palpitations, muscle tension, and increased urination. Psychological symptoms include nervousness, feelings of dread or impending doom, unpleasant tenseness, and many more. The most common agents used in anxiety dis\u00adorders are benzodiazepines and antidepres\u00adsants. The benzodiazepines most frequently used are alprazolam and lorazepam. Diazepam and clonazepam are used less often. Because the benzodiazepines can cause significant problems in patients who are addicted as well as in patients who are not addicted, they generally are not recommend\u00aded for people with substance use disorders or for long\u00adterm treatment of anxiety or depres\u00adsive disorders. Antidepressants may be considered sooner if depression is a known pre\u00adexisting condition or historical experience and collateral infor\u00admation suggests a comorbid depression. Again the risk of treating prematurely needs to be weighed against the risk of not treating a con\u00addition that may prevent recovery from a sub\u00adstance use disorder. Antidepressants such as imipramine and nortriptyline serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as fluoxetine (Prozac) have a low addiction potential and can be used with relative safety. They differ in their tendency to produce sedation and anxiety and have a withdrawal 140 Chapter 5 syndrome of their own. Because of its anti\u00ad cholinergic properties, imipramine is more sedating, but nortriptyline and the SSRIs can produce anxiousness in some individuals and sedation in others. Not all individuals react the same way to these medications. When medications are used, a specific target symptom should be the focus. Also, medica\u00ad tions should be tried in time\u00adlimited intervals, such as weeks to months. A \"drug holiday\" (i.e., a brief period where the patient stops taking medications) should then be attempted to see if the medication is still necessary. The patient should be instructed that the medications will not \"cure\" the addiction, that treatment of anxiety will not control the addiction, and that treatment of the addiction will not necessarily ameliorate the anxiety dis\u00adorder. In essence, the substance use disorder must be treated independently of the anxiety disorder and vice versa. Depressive Disorders General approach Prevalence rates for the co\u00adoccurrence of depressive and addictive disorders range from 5 to 25 percent in epidemiologic and clinical studies. Depressive disorders include major depressive and dysthymic disorders, which can occur independently with addictive disorders, or similar depressive symptoms can be induced by substance use disorders. Major depressive disorder is more common in older individuals and in women and can be difficult to distinguish from substance\u00adinduced depression. Depression can be viewed as protective and can be associated with \"healing\" in many con\u00ad ditions involving emotions. For example, a grief reaction is an expected experience after loss, with depression an essential emotion in this process. Recovery from a substance use disorder has been compared to a grief reac\u00ad tion because of losses (e.g., of the substance or relationships based on substance use) suf\u00adfered by the patient with an addictive disor\u00ad der. Likewise, and analogous to the role of anxiety, depression also is a part of the heal\u00ading process that the patient with a substance use disorder experiences during recovery. Depressant drugs (e.g., alcohol) can produce depression during intoxication which often resolves following abstinence. A survey of 69 adults with alcohol use disorders showed a strong correlation between the reduction in cravings for alcohol over 2 weeks of absti\u00adnence and the lifting of depressive mood. The patients' cravings were assessed with the Obsessive\u00adCompulsive Drinking Scale (OCDS) and their depressive symptoms measured with the Self\u00adrating Depressive Scale (SDS). Between day 1 and day 14, their cravings score dropped nearly a third, while the scores for severity of depression fell by about one fourth. The correlation between the reduction in cravings and the lifting of depression per\u00adsisted after controlling for sex, age, duration and extent of alcohol abuse, and the amount of clomethiazole administered (Anderson and Kiefer 2004). Stimulant drugs (e.g., cocaine) can produce depression during withdrawal. These effects may be prolonged with certain drugs that linger in the body (i.e., are stored in fat), such as cannabis and benzodiazepines. These drugs can produce depression or anxiety that is indistinguishable from other psychiatric causes of depression. Therefore, they must be considered causative whenever depression is present, and the possibility of addiction needs to be assessed when these drugs are identi\u00adfied. While depression may persist for weeks or months, it often resolves within days with abstinence from these drugs. Pharmacologic therapies The use of medication is recommended if the depression persists beyond a few weeks of drug withdrawal or arises during confirmed abstinence (laboratory drug testing may be necessary to confirm abstinence). The risk of suppressing normal depressive processes dur\u00ad Co\u00adOccurring Medical and Psychiatric Conditions 141 ing recovery versus the benefit from sup\u00ad pressing depression that is interfering with function should be weighed, as is the case with anxiety disorders. Antidepressants are the main treatment for depression. The target symptoms are a sad mood, tearfulness, appetite and sleep distur\u00adbances, and other neurovegetative symptoms. Depression can be found in many conditions, including a variety of psychiatric and medical conditions. SSRIs are the drug of choice for many physicians treating depressed patients with substance use disorders. Although some are costly, they provide adequate treatment of depression with fewer side effects than other medications commonly used (Thase et al. 2001). Depressive disorders are thought to have a significant biological component, including deficiencies in such central nervous system neurotransmitters as serotonin, nore\u00adpinephrine, and dopamine. Interestingly, these neurotransmitters are also affected by substances of abuse. These agents are thought to act by increasing the activity of these neu\u00adrotransmitters, ultimately alleviating depres\u00adsion and stabilizing mood. Bipolar Disorders General approach Prevalence rates for the co\u00adoccurrence of bipolar and addictive disorders range from 30 to 60 percent, depending on the population studied, in epidemiologic and clinical studies (Chen et al. 1998; Sallom 2000; Sonne and Brady 1999; Strakowski and DelBello 2000). Mania is a condition associated with elevated mood, grandiosity, hyperactive behavior, poor judgment, and lack of insight. The patient with mania will show excess such as spending sprees, sexual promiscuity, intru\u00ad siveness, and abnormal alcohol and drug use. A manic episode can follow, precede, or alter\u00ad nate with depressive moods. Bipolar disorder may be complicated by the influence of substances (Sonne and Brady 1999). The manic state can be produced by stimulants (e.g., cocaine) during intoxication, and from depressants (e.g., alcohol) during withdrawal. A period of confirmed abstinence usually is necessary before mood\u00adstabilizing drugs are started. Generally, a period of a week or two may be required for the role of drugs in inducing manic symptoms to be properly assessed. Pharmacologic therapies Mood stabilizers control bipolar disorders in patients with or without co\u00adoccurring sub\u00adstance use disorder. These medications can control either the manic or depressed phase, or both. Manic episodes can occur cyclically, alterna\u00ad tively, and concurrently with depressive episodes. One theory of the pathogenesis of bipolar disorder involves the neurotransmit\u00adter norepinephrine (i.e., excessive in mania and deficient in depression). Lithium is a natural salt, available in the car\u00ad bonate form and slow release preparations. Its exact mechanism of action is unknown, but it can be effective in reducing or prevent\u00ading the recurrence of manic and depressive episodes. Lithium carbonate must be taken daily in doses of 600 to 2,400mg to achieve plasma levels in the 0.5 to 1.5\u00adm equiv/L range. It should be noted that studies have shown that lithium has no conclusively posi\u00adtive effect on rates of abstinence in either depressed or nondepressed patients. Anticonvulsant mood stabilizers, such as divalproex sodium and carbamazepine, can be effective in controlling mania and, some evidence suggests, in co\u00adoccurring addictive conditions as well. Carbamazepine is known to be as effective as some benzodiazepines in inpatient treatment of alcohol withdrawal and, because of its anticonvulsant properties, it may be a good choice for treating those patients at high risk of withdrawal seizures 142 Chapter 5 (Malcolm et al. 2001). One theoretical expla\u00ad nation for the mechanism of action for carba\u00admazepine involves suppression of mood cen\u00adters in the limbic system that act like seizure foci. In this context, a \"kindling\" model has been proposed for both mood and addictive disorders (Gelenberg and Bassuk 1997). Psychotic Disorders General approach Prevalence rates for co\u00adoccurrence of schizophrenic and addictive disorders range from 40 to 80 percent, depending on the pop\u00adulation studied, in epidemiologic and clinical studies. Schizophrenia is a chronic illness character\u00adized by bizarre thinking and behavior. Hallucinations and delusions are \"positive\" symptoms of the psychotic process, while symptoms such as social withdrawal and poverty of emotions are \"negative\" symptoms (or deficit syndrome). Conventional neurolep\u00adtics are more effective for positive symptoms, whereas behavioral, group, and individual psychotherapy are more effective for negative symptoms. New agents such as clozapine and risperidone may be more effective in treating both the positive and negative symptoms. Psychosis can be caused by stimulant drug use during intoxication and depressant drug/alcohol use during withdrawal. A period of weeks or months may be necessary to assess the effects of substances of abuse, but as with anxiety, depression, or mania, medi\u00adcations can be started at almost any time as the psychosis is persistent and waiting is not possible. Moreover, the greater the number of psychiatric admissions, the greater the proba\u00ad bility of a chronic mental disorder associated with the co\u00adoccurring psychiatric disorder. High\u00ad or moderate\u00adpotency neuroleptics (e.g., haloperidol or atypical agents) generally are the agents of choice in the treatment of schizophrenia. The clinical potency correlates with the drug's ability to block the action of the neurotransmitter dopamine at its postsy\u00adnaptic receptor sites. Adverse Effects Antianxiety A period of confirmed abstinence usually is necessary before mood\u00ad stabilizing drugs are started. agents While benzodi\u00ad azepines are useful in the short term, their efficacy wanes with long\u00adterm use, probably because of the development of pharmacologic toler\u00adance and depen\u00addence. It should be noted that benzodi\u00adazepines can be addicting, particu\u00adlarly in those already addicted to other substances. Antipsychotic agents Antipsychotics can produce sedation and hypotension (at times causing lightheadedness in some individuals), particularly with postu\u00adral changes. Conventional neuroleptics pro\u00adduce acute extrapyramidal reactions, which Dystonia usually responds to drugs such as ben\u00adztropine or diphenhydramine. Akathisia is the subjective feeling of anxiety and tension, causing the patient to feel compelled to move about restlessly. This symptom usually requires beta blocker, as a decrease in the antipsychotic dose does not have the desired effect. Alternatively, switching to risperidone may accomplish the intended effect while avoiding intolerable neurologic syndromes. Co\u00adOccurring Medical and Psychiatric Conditions 143 tricyclics, can produce sedation, hypotension, anticholinergic SSRIs can anxiousness, sedation, insomnia, and gastrointestinal upset. A withdrawal syn\u00addrome also has been reported with most antidepressant medications. The SSRIs are preferred in patients with addiction and co\u00adoccurring psychiatric condi\u00adtions because of their reduced side effect pro\u00adfile and low risk of dangerous drug interac\u00adtions; for example, there are no anticholiner\u00adgic effects on the senses and no risk of lethal effects from overdose. Cognitive State in Recovery A person recovering from a substance use dis\u00adorder must have a clear mind and a stable mood. Medications have a tendency, some\u00adtimes subtly and other times obviously, to dull the senses and thinking and blunt or disrupt the emotions. People with substance use dis\u00adorders must eventually change and control feelings to remain abstinent and also to com\u00adply with psychiatric management. The ability of a person with a substance use disorder to use the 12 steps of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and to accept psychiatric advice will depend on clear thinking and emotional bal\u00adance, which is stressed as central to the recovery process in AA. In other cases\u2014such as patients with traumatic brain injuries\u2014 treatment venues should be adaptable to their cognitive abilities. Accordingly, the use of medications should be conservative, taking into consideration the pros and cons of their expected positive and negative effects. Unfortunately, few psychi\u00adatric medications are totally free of mood\u00adaltering properties. However, the cognitive state of individuals who have a serious mental illness often is more distorted when not medi\u00adcated appropriately. The very nature of their illness is a disruption to their cognitive pro\u00adcesses. Dosing Because of inherent susceptibility to drug effects by people with substance use disorders, it is important to use the lowest effective doses possible. Also, the intervals for administration should be selected to reduce effects on cogni\u00ad tion and feelings. 144 Chapter 5 In This Chapter... Preparing and Developing a Program Working in Today's Managed Care Environment Preparing for the Future 6 Financing and Organizational Issues Preparing and Developing a Program Developing a detoxification program is a major financial challenge, whether the program requires building an entirely new organization or is part of an existing treatment entity. The process of program development requires careful planning, especially to ensure adequate financial support for the operation. The decision to develop a detoxifi\u00adcation program should be based on a well\u00addeveloped strategic plan\u00adning process (see chapter 2) and a clear understanding of what a detoxification program entails. Because the new program will incur major costs for office space, furniture, staff, computers, and other equipment before clients can be provided with services and payment can be received, significant amounts of initial capital may be needed. As soon as the administrator or planner identifies a market need for detoxification services, potential fiscal support and other resources should be identified and checked to see if such support is likely and sufficient. Both implementation and initial operating costs must be covered. It may be possible to find strategic partners who will provide resources, work with the program planner, provide office space, or help obtain funding. Community organizations that see a need for establishing detoxification and treatment services are likely partners. Locally based foundations and businesses also may be approached for assistance with developing a program, especially if a case can be made to the potential funder that ongoing costs can be covered from opera\u00ad tions. It is important to have documented assurance from major referral and payment sources that they will refer patients with information on payment sources; that is, by the referral source, by a third party, or 145 by patients who have the documented finan\u00ad cial resources to pay for detoxification treat\u00adment themselves. Signed contracts with expected payors may be useful to ensure ade\u00adquate cash flow and to establish a budget for the new program's fee structure. Identifying and recruiting strategic partners is one of the most important steps in the pro\u00adgram development process. Before and during the program development process, adminis\u00adtrators and planners should work closely with potential referral and payment sources to determine their needs and to see if the detoxi\u00adfication program will fit those needs. Programs also will need to learn whether referral sources are open to new partners, the types of contracts they utilize, their time\u00adframes for reimbursement, and the process for negotiating a contract. Among useful tac\u00adtics to employ is holding focus groups and strategy meetings with individuals from potential referral sources; these groups can suggest the types of services they need and for which they will reimburse. Potential referral sources will be more invested in the program if they are involved throughout the planning process. All potential stakeholders should be informed regularly of the developing plans and milestones achieved. Program planners should follow up on all potential leads for both funding sources and potential referral sources. Relationships with referral sources are important to build and maintain. Obviously, referral sources need to be carefully assessed to ensure that they can provide patients who have needs and resources appropriate for the services the program will provide. Leads for potential sources of funding and referrals may include the contacts made during a focus group pro\u00ad cess, public system payors and planners, pri\u00ad vate insurance plans, contracting agents for private insurance (e.g., managed care organi\u00ad zations [MCOs]), and local employers large enough to have employee assistance programs (EAPs) or managed behavioral health plans that cover detoxification services. Direct con\u00ad tact with the EAPs or managed behavioral health plans may be necessary to ensure both private sector demand for services and appropriate reimbursement of the services. Forming strategic alliances with other compo\u00ad nents of the treatment environment can be both an important source for referrals and a resource for clients with needs other than detoxification. Vertical alliances facilitate referrals up and down the continuum of care. An alliance with a larger organization can increase leverage when negotiating with an MCO. The Dramatically Changing Pattern of Utilization of Detoxification Services The settings for detoxification services have changed dramatically over the last decade, as have patients' primary substances of abuse. As the setting for detoxification services has shift\u00ad ed from inpatient to outpatient, the primary substance abuse problem of clients has shifted from alcohol and cocaine/crack to heroin and other opioids. This shift has created significant opportunities in the market for detoxification services for community\u00adbased and entrepreneurial providers that are not part of hospitals, or for freestanding detoxification facilities that are owned by hospitals. Changes in practice patterns and in the epi\u00ad demiology of substance abuse in the last decade have been dramatic. Between 1993 and 2000, the number of admissions to hospi\u00adtal inpatient settings for detoxification of patients with a primary problem of alcohol abuse declined by 79.6 percent. During the same period, the total admissions to inpatient hospital detoxification services declined by 69.3 percent, from 23.5 percent of total detoxification admissions in 1993 to 8.8 per\u00adcent of total detoxification admissions in 2000, while admissions to 24\u00adhour free\u00adstand\u00ading detoxification units increased by the same 14.7 percentage points, from 60.5 percent of total admissions in 1993 to 75.1 percent of total admissions for detoxification services in 146 Chapter 6 2000. During this same period, the number of alcohol admissions to free\u00adstanding clinics decreased by 32.0 percent and the number of cocaine/crack admissions decreased by 42.5 percent. Concurrently, heroin admissions (to free\u00adstanding clinics) increased substantially from just under a quarter of total detoxifica\u00adtion admissions in 1993 to just over a third of total admissions in 2000. Of course, these statistics reflect national trends and regional differences in patterns of both practice and substance abuse. Changes in specific geographic areas will vary. Prospective programs should carefully research their own local market for detoxifi\u00adcation services and should obtain data on current utilization of and demand for detoxi\u00adfication in their local area before proceeding with program development. Funding Streams and Other Resources in the Substance Abuse Treatment Environment Substance abuse treatment and detoxification services in the United States are financed through a diverse mix of public and private sources, with substantially more being spent by the public sector. Public sources account for 64 percent of all substance abuse treat\u00adment spending, a much higher percentage than public expenditure for the rest of health care (Coffey et al. 2001). The existence of diverse funding streams presents both man\u00ad agement challenges and opportunities for pro\u00ad gram independence and stability. However, a program with only one major funding source is financially and clinically vulnerable to changes in its major source's budget and pri\u00ad orities, and this situation should be avoided. Diversification of funding sources should be a major goal for detoxification programs. Usually, each funding stream has different approval and reporting requirements. Because of this, any new or existing detoxifi\u00adcation program requires a fairly sophisticated management and accounting system to meet the reporting needs and performance require\u00adments of each purchaser, to provide informa\u00adtion that meets their requirements, and to generate the appropriate bills/invoices. Detoxification program administrators must be knowledgeable about efficient business practices, the use of data\u00adbased performance measures, accounting, budgeting, financing, and financial and clinical reporting. It also is important to reach out to other potential sources of support such as founda\u00adtions, board mem\u00adbers, and local or national corporate Identifying and recruiting strategic partners is one of the most important steps in the program development process. donation programs for any assistance will help to that reduce costs, increase revenue, or improve productivity and effectiveness and aid in the suc\u00adcess of the organiza\u00adtion. Searching for support does not end with ensuring initial funding. Planners must make good use of the Internet to uncover potential cash and in\u00adkind donations that can supplement major funding sources, discussed below. Entrepreneurial, for\u00adprofit programs may be able to attract private capital. Not\u00adfor\u00adprofit entities that are similarly entrepreneurial may be able to take advantage of this poten\u00adtial source of funding through establishment of a for\u00adprofit subsidiary. Detoxification pro\u00adgrams in particular, as opposed to some other areas of substance abuse treatment, may be attractive candidates for private financing because of their potential to serve privately insured and self\u00adpay patients. However, acceptance of private capital usually carries with it requirements for rapid growth in rev\u00ad Financing and Organizational Issues 147 enues and profitability that may be difficult to meet and may limit operational flexibility, at least in the short term. In the longer term, successful detoxification programs may be able to generate profits. Funding streams associated with public and private health insurance often provide bene\u00adfits to covered individuals that vary according to whether or not the services are facility\u00ad based and accord\u00ading to the level or setting of care. The Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant program is the cornerstone of Federal funding for substance abuse treatment and detoxification programs. Complexity arises because coverage and reimbursement depend both on whether a service is considered to be a medical service or a substance abuse treatment service and whether a ser\u00advice is facility based. Many public and private benefit plans still classify substance abuse detoxification as a medical rather than a substance abuse treatment service. In general, and especially for employer\u00adbased coverage, benefits under a medical plan are provided at higher reimbursement rates with fewer limits and restrictions than are benefits for substance abuse treatment (Merrick et al. 2001). Requirements for out\u00adof\u00adpocket pay\u00adments by those covered under these plans typically are lower under the medical portion of a plan than under the substance abuse treatment portion. However, it is important to note that benefit plan features are but one component of coverage; utilization manage\u00adment procedures continue to play a very important role in a patient's access to specific services. Any episode of detoxification may be denied reimbursement under a plan if medi\u00adcal necessity is not demonstrated to the satis\u00adfaction of the plan or if the service is provid\u00aded at a higher level of care than is judged medically necessary. It is important to decide whether to make a new detoxification program hospital\u00adbased, facility\u00adbased, or office\u00adbased. Services that are considered hospital\u00ad or facility\u00adbased, like those in hospital outpatient departments, often are eligible for higher payment rates than office\u00adbased services to reflect their greater capital and other overhead costs. Similarly, hospital inpatient services often are reimbursed at a higher payment rate than outpatient services, but medical necessity determinations also require patients to need more intensive services. Sometimes, patient copayments or coinsurance rates may be higher for office\u00adbased services than facility\u00adbased services. This is true for Medicare as well as for other health insurance plans. Detoxification programs that are parts of hos\u00adpitals, affiliated with a hospital, or consid\u00adered as a licensed facility themselves may be eligible for higher rates of reimbursement than are those that are considered to be out\u00adpatient programs with no facility license. However, utilization management criteria to authorize payment for admission to and con\u00adtinued stay in a hospital inpatient setting require a significantly greater severity of patient diagnosis than do criteria for admis\u00adsion and continued stay in a freestanding or outpatient program. On the other hand, often there are high barriers to obtaining a facility license to open a freestanding 24\u00adhour facility or licensed outpatient detoxification facility. Programs that are part of or affiliated with hospitals also must contend with overhead cost allocations from the hospital as well as with oversight from hospital administrators who may know little about substance abuse treatment or detoxification. In addition, some health insurance plans actually exclude cov\u00aderage for hospital\u00adbased or freestanding facil\u00adity\u00adbased detoxification programs and others may subject admissions to such programs to 148 Chapter 6 more intensive review than admissions to non-facility\u00adbased detoxification programs. Program planners should consider carefully all alternatives; decisions concerning affilia\u00adtion with a hospital or pursuit of a facility license have far\u00adreaching financial and politi\u00adcal ramifications and should be made with as much information as possible. Following is a discussion of the key funding streams and resources that are available for programs providing detoxification services. SAPT Block Grant The Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment (SAPT) Block Grant program is the cornerstone of Federal funding for sub\u00adstance abuse treatment and detoxification programs. These funds are sent to the State's Single State Agency (SSA) for substance abuse for distribution to counties, municipali\u00adties, and designated programs. Some of the funds are subject to required set\u00adasides for special populations. Each program should check to see if the clients it intends to serve are eligible for block grant funding, either for set\u00adasides or for other funds. Each State maintains its own criteria for eligibility and the criteria and definitions vary greatly among States. Multistate providers will need to check specifically in each State in which they operate. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) provides funding for substance abuse treatment and prevention through the block grants as well as a large variety of other mechanisms, includ\u00ad ing both discretionary grants and contracts. A portion of the SAMHSA Web site is devoted to various funding opportunities. The most recent available data indicate that the SAPT Block Grant accounts for approxi\u00admately 40 percent of public funds nationally expended for prevention and treatment of substance abuse (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2003). Funds from the block grant may come directly from the SSA or be channeled through regional or county intermediary agencies. Services may be paid for through grants, contracts, fee\u00adfor\u00adservice, and/or managed care arrangements. The Children's Health Act of 2000 mandated a gradual transition from SAPT Block Grants to Performance Partnership Grants (PPGs). Providers should follow developments through their SSA, which include Changes in reimbursement. Treatment purchasing systems may evolve over time; managed care arrangements and require\u00adments are increasingly common. Performance outcome data. In accordance with Federal legislation, PPGs eventually will replace SAPT Block Grants and will provide more flexibility for States as well as require more accountability based on out\u00adcome and other performance data. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) and the States are establishing performance out\u00adcome measures for funding programs under the block grants. All data for core measures are collected from States receiving PPG dollars. Medicaid Medicaid, administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) in conjunction with the States, provides finan\u00adcial assistance to States to pay for medical care of specifically defined eligible persons. Medicaid is being used by many States as a vehicle for experimentation with public sector managed care in an effort to expand medical coverage to the uninsured. About 2 percent of total Medicaid expenditures nationally are for substance abuse treatment services (Mark et al. 2003 a) but Medicaid supports about 20 percent of national expenditures for sub\u00adstance abuse services (Coffey et al. 2001). The level of expenditure varies greatly by State. Medicaid is an entitlement program with sev\u00aderal distinct eligible groups: low\u00adincome chil\u00addren, pregnant women, the elderly, and peo\u00adple who are blind or disabled, all or some of whom can be enrolled in a detoxification pro\u00adgram population. Some substance abuse treatment programs will want to target pro\u00ad Financing and Organizational Issues 149 grams to the Medicaid population; if the State's coverage and payment rates are mini\u00admal, however, other funders should be explored in greater depth. The reason for substantial variation in State Medicaid expenditures and coverage is that substance abuse treatment and rehabilitation is an optional benefit under Medicaid that States have the discretion to include or not include in their Medicaid program. Medicaid may pay for substance abuse treatment either directly through fee\u00adfor\u00adservice arrangements or through a managed behavioral health care or other MCO with which it contracts. More than one type of arrangement may exist with\u00adin the same State. Rates of payment/reim\u00adbursement are determined by each State inde\u00adpendently and may vary within the State among the various coverage arrangements. If a State decides to include benefits for sub\u00adstance abuse treatment in its Medicaid pro\u00adgram, it can choose the precise services and levels of care that will be reimbursed. The services provided under managed care may differ from those under fee\u00adfor\u00adservice arrangements. Although most States offer some coverage for detoxification services under their Medicaid program (Office of the Inspector General 1998), not all types or set\u00adtings for detoxification programs are covered in those States that do provide coverage. Therefore, a State Medicaid program may cover certain substance abuse treatment ser\u00advices but not cover detoxification services. For more information, readers should contact their State Medicaid office. An important distinction of the Medicaid ben\u00ad efit structure since its inception has been the exclusion of coverage for services provided in an Institute for Mental Disorders (IMD), defined as a facility with more than 16 beds that treats mental disorders, including sub\u00ad stance abuse, for individuals between the ages of 21 and 64 (Rosenbaum et al. 2002). Although services furnished by outpatient detoxification programs are not excluded, detoxification programs should be aware of the IMD exclusion in their program planning process. The Medicaid Early Periodic Screening Detection and Treatment (EPSDT) mandate requires States to screen all children and ado\u00adlescents on Medicaid for physical and behav\u00adioral health disorders. Further, EPSDT requires that any needed medical treatment is provided to children, even if the service is not in the State's Medicaid plan submitted to CMS. Although the procedures and screening tools vary by State, and there is significant variation in their identification of substance abuse issues, the EPSDT program is an important entrance to substance abuse treat\u00adment for children and adolescents (Semansky et al. 2003). When available, Medicaid coverage offers the following advantages: It can provide significant treatment funding for certain high\u00adrisk groups, such as low\u00ad income mothers and adolescents. Client copays traditionally have not been required so the program receives the entire negotiated fee without having to collect funds from clients. (However, some States have changed this provision due to budget crises.) A Medicaid contract can provide a useful lower limit for rate negotiations with com\u00ad mercial payors by essentially prohibiting acceptance of contract terms with any other purchaser at rates lower than those estab\u00ad lished for Medicaid. Certification as a Medicaid provider also can position the program to receive patients from other public sector referral sources, making it possible to obtain patients from sources such as social services, indigent care funds, and criminal justice systems. The criminal justice and juvenile justice sys\u00ad tems and drug court administrators typically favor providers that are eligible for Medicaid reimbursement because treatment of some offenders can then be billed to Medicaid in some States. 150 Chapter 6 Medicaid link to Supplemental Security Income Supplemental Security Income (SSI) is a pro\u00ad gram financed through general tax revenues. SSI recipients are one of the mandated popu\u00adlations for Medicaid, but specific provisions vary by State. SSI disability benefits are payable to adults or children who are blind or have certain other disabilities that make it impossible for them to work, who have limit\u00aded income and resources, who meet the living arrangement requirements, and who are oth\u00ad erwise eligible. Congress has excluded a pri\u00admary diagnosis of substance abuse as a quali\u00adfying disability under the Social Security Administration's programs, but if there is another primary disability that qualifies the person for SSI, a secondary substance abuse diagnosis remains acceptable. Many SSI recipients with a mental disorder diagnosis have a co\u00adoccurring substance abuse diagnosis. Medicare Medicare provides coverage to individuals over age 65, people under the age of 65 with certified disabilities, and people with end\u00adstage renal disease. Medicare supports about 8 percent of national expenditures for sub\u00adstance abuse treatment services. Medicare may provide Part A coverage to clients in detoxification programs that are based in hos\u00adpitals certified by Medicare. However, detoxi\u00adfication programs that provide only a struc\u00adtured environment, socialization, and/or vocational rehabilitation are not covered by Medicare . Medicare imposes very strict review requirements for detoxification pro\u00ad grams based in hospitals and detoxification programs that are considered to be partial hospitalization programs, and for patients in those detoxification programs. Alternatively, Medicare may provide Part B coverage to clients in detoxification programs with Medicare\u00adcertified medical practitioners; however, clients whose services are reim\u00adbursed under Part B are required to pay 50 percent of Medicare\u00adapproved amounts. For more information, contact the Social Security Administration, Medicare provider enrollment department, or State Medicare services. Medicare link to Social Security Disability Insurance The Social Security Administration provides Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) to individuals and cer\u00adtain members of their family if they Medicaid supports about 20 percent and Medicare supports about 8 percent of national expenditures for substance abuse treatment services. have worked long enough and paid Social Security taxes. Recipients of SSDI benefits are covered by Medicare following a 2\u00adyear waiting period. SSDI is a program financed with Social Security taxes paid by workers, employ\u00ad ers, and self\u00ademployed persons. In order to be eligi\u00ad ble for a Social Security benefit, the worker must earn sufficient credits based on taxable work. Disability benefits are payable to disabled workers, disabled widow(er)s, or adults disabled since childhood, who are oth\u00aderwise eligible. A substance abuse diagnosis was excluded by Congress as a qualifying dis\u00adability for SSDI, but a secondary substance abuse diagnosis is acceptable if the person is qualified by another primary diagnosis, such as mental illness, which often co\u00adoccurs. Financing and Organizational Issues 151 State Children's Health Insurance Program The State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) provides funds for sub\u00adstance abuse treatment of children and ado\u00adlescents in many States. This program pro\u00advides low\u00adcost health insurance for children of low\u00adincome fami\u00adlies who are not eli\u00adgible for Medicaid. Substance abuse treatment and detoxification services in the United States are funded through a diverse mix of public and private sources. States have the option of providing SCHIP benefits under their existing Medicaid program or designing a sepa\u00adrate children's health insurance program entirely separate from Medicaid. If the program is part of Medicaid, then the substance abuse benefits will mirror those under Medicaid. If the State designs its own program, CMS has promulgated a set of rules to ensure that coverage meets minimum stan\u00addards. A State's Alcohol and Drug Abuse Agency also may be able to provide informa\u00ad tion on resources available for treatment of transition\u00adage youth who have exceeded the maximum age for the SCHIP program in the State. For more information see the State SCHIP program office. TRICARE TRICARE is a regionally managed health care program for active duty and retired members of the uniformed services and their families and survivors. TRICARE supple\u00adments the healthcare resources of the Army, Navy, and Air Force with networks of civilian healthcare professionals. TRICARE consists of TRICARE Prime, where Military Treatment Facilities are the principal source of health care; TRICARE Extra, a preferred provider option; and TRICARE Standard, a fee\u00adfor\u00adservice option that replaced the pro\u00adgram formerly known as CHAMPUS. The TRICARE Extra and Standard benefits include treatment for substance abuse, sub\u00adject to preauthorization requirements, but programs will need to check to see if detoxifi\u00adcation programs are eligible or preauthorized under TRICARE managed care arrange\u00adments. TRICARE is run by managed care contractors, each of whom may have different authorization procedures. Indian Health Service The Indian Health Service (IHS) is an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services that operates a comprehensive health service delivery system for approximately 1.6 million of the Nation's estimated 2.6 million American Indians and Alaska Natives. Most IHS funds are appropriated for American Indians who live on or near reservations. Congress also has authorized programs that provide some access to care for Indians who live in urban areas. IHS services are provid\u00aded directly and through tribally contracted and operated health programs. Health ser\u00advices also include health care purchased from more than 9,000 private providers annually. The IHS behavioral health program supports alcoholism and other drug dependency treat\u00adment, detoxification, rehabilitation, and pre\u00advention services for individuals and their families. Department of Veterans Affairs The Department of Veterans Affairs provides the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Veterans Administration to eligible beneficia\u00ad 152 Chapter 6 ries. Medically necessary treatment of sub\u00ad stance abuse is a covered benefit; beneficiaries are entitled to three substance use disorder treatment benefit periods in their lifetimes. Social Services Funding for substance abuse treatment, which may include detoxification services, also may be available through arrangements with agencies funded by the U.S. Depart\u00adments of Labor, Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and Education (ED). Some Federal sources of funding for sub\u00adstance abuse treatment under these programs may prohibit use of funds for \"medical\" ser\u00ad vices. However, services performed by those not in the medical profession (e.g., coun\u00adselors, technicians, social workers, psycholo\u00adgists) and services not provided in a hospital or clinic (including 24\u00adhour care programs) may be considered nonmedical. The precise definition of \"medical\" under some of these Federal programs may be determined by each State individually, so administrators need to check with their State authorities to deter\u00admine exactly which services may be funded through these sources. Even if funding for detoxification services is not available through these programs, programs may be able to link their clients to them for support for services that enable them to initiate and complete treatment successfully. Oppor\u00adtunities include the following: T emporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF). Under the TANF programs, each State receives a Federal block grant to fund treatment for eligible unemployed persons and their children, usually women with dependent children. Services that overcome barriers to employment (e.g., substance abuse treatment) are eligible for formula grants\u2014with one quarter of the money allo\u00adcated to local communities through a com\u00adpetitive grant process. The funding chan\u00ad nels vary by State. Funds may be directed through Private Industry Councils, Workforce Investment Boards, Workforce Development Boards, and similar bodies at the State and community levels. Although States may not use TANF funds for \"medi\u00ad cal\" services, States have considerable lati\u00ad tude in the definition of \"medical,\" and have used TANF funds to support the fol\u00adlowing substance abuse treatment services: screening/assessment, detoxification, outpa\u00adtient treatment, non\u00adhospital residential treatment, case management, education/ prevention, housing, employment services, and monitoring (Rubinstein 2002). Even if these funds are not available for substance abuse treatment in a State or program, the program's clients may be able to access this source of assistance for employment train\u00ading, child care, and other support needs. Social Services Block Grant. Under Title XX of the Social Security Act, the Administration for Children and Families provides a block grant to each State for the purpose of furnishing social services. Funds may not be used for medical services (except initial detoxification of an individu\u00adal who is alcohol or drug dependent). In 2002, these funds provided close to $8 mil\u00adlion for substance abuse treatment in 14 States (Administration for Children and Families 2002). Public housing. HUD funds substance abuse treatment of public housing residents under the Public Housing Drug Elimination Program. HUD awards grants to public housing authorities, tribes, or tribally desig\u00ad nated housing entities to fund treatment. Funds are channeled to local public housing authorities, which contract with service providers. In addition, special housing pro\u00ad grams are available for people who are home\u00ad less and have substance use disorders. Vocational rehabilitation. Federal ED funds support services that help people with disabilities participate in the workforce. Treatment of substance use disorders is eli\u00adgible for funding. Funds are channeled to Financing and Organizational Issues 153 the State agencies responsible for vocational rehabilitation. Children's protective services. Title IV of the Social Security Act provides funding for foster care and services to prevent child abuse and neglect. Eligible services include substance abuse treatment for parents who are ordered by a court to obtain treatment and are at risk for losing custody of their children. Medicaid also covers these chil\u00ad dren, as they are a mandatory eligibility group. Ryan White. The Federal Ryan White CARE Act, enacted in 1990, provides health care for people with HIV disease. Under Title I of the Ryan White CARE Act, which provides emergency assistance to Eligible Metropolitan Areas that are most severely affected by the HIV/AIDS epidem\u00adic, funds are available for substance abuse treatment. Over 500,000 people are served through this program each year. Criminal justice/juvenile justice (CJ/JJ) systems Both State and local CJ/JJ systems purchase substance abuse treatment services. The man\u00ad ner in which these systems work varies across locales. The following are common components of these systems: State corrections systems may provide funds for treatment of offenders who are returning to the community, through parole offices, halfway houses, or residential cor\u00adrectional facilities. Community corrections systems may include a system of presentence diversion or parole services, including drug court, that may mandate substance abuse treatment in lieu of incarceration. Community drug courts may send low\u00adrisk, nonviolent offenders to substance abuse treatment in lieu of incarceration\u2014pro\u00adgrams can be under contract to provide this treatment. Correctional residential facilities serve offenders returning from a State correction\u00adal system; the programs may extend con\u00adtracts for substance abuse treatment to pre\u00advent relapse of treated offenders. Juvenile court systems may provide con\u00ad tracts to programs with expertise in treating adolescents to treat juvenile offenders in correctional facilities or who are otherwise involved in the criminal justice system. Providers should understand the culture, val\u00adues, and needs of the CJ/JJ system so they can develop responsive services for this spe\u00adcial needs population. For more information, see TIP 21, Combining Alcohol and Other Drug Abuse Treatment With Diversion for Juveniles in the Justice System (CSAT 1995b), TIP 30, Continuity of Offender Treatment for Substance Use Disorders From Institution to Community (CSAT 1998b), and TIP 44, Substance Abuse Treatment for Adults in the Criminal Justice System (CSAT 2005b). Byrne Formula Grant Program The Byrne Formula Grant Program awards grants to States to improve the functioning of the criminal justice system. Grants may be used to provide rehabilitation of offend\u00ad ers who violate State and local laws. One of the 26 Byrne Formula Grant purpose areas is providing programs that identify and meet the treatment needs of adult and juve\u00ad nile offenders who are drug and alcohol dependent. However, the availability of Byrne Formula Grant funds depends on annual Congressional appropriations and declines have been proposed for funding in recent years. 154 Chapter 6 County and local governments County and local governments often contract for the delivery of substance abuse treatment services using locally available funds. The annual availability of these funds depends in part on State fiscal conditions. Schools Local public schools may be a source of fund\u00ad ing for assessments; however, they rarely pay for ongoing treatment. Some services may be reimbursable under the special entitlements for children with disabilities. Private Payors Private sources of revenue include a range of entities from large MCOs to local or self\u00adinsured national employers. Most health plans offered by large employers operate under managed care arrangements. Sometimes, a health plan may cover some substance abuse treatments under the mental health benefit portion of their plan; others may provide coverage through the medical component. In many cases, substance abuse treatment benefits, when offered, are provid\u00aded through Managed Behavioral Healthcare Organizations (MBHOs) (see \"Working In Today's Managed Care Environment,\" p. 157, for a more detailed discussion of man\u00adaged care arrangements). Because substance abuse coverage is a minor cost to employers, accounting for about 0.4 percent of the cost of health insurance overall (Schoenbaum et al. 1998), it may be difficult to get employers' attention, despite the high profile that sub\u00adstance abuse problems sometimes present. In general, three broad categories of private funding may be distinguished: Contracts with health plans, MCOs, and MBHOs. Direct service contracts with local employers. Local employers may contract directly with substance abuse services providers if the ben\u00adefits offered by their health plans are inade\u00ad quate. Contracts with EAPs. Some employers have EAPs that can provide direct service con\u00ad tracts for a particular detoxification pro\u00ad gram. Contributions By developing relationships with people in the community, an administrator can find new sources for support of capital and operations. Even if a source is reluctant to provide funds to support treatment services directly, other aspects of pro\u00ad gram development, Many public and private benefit plans still classify detoxification as a medical rather than a substance abuse treatment service. organizational growth, and opera\u00ad tions or equipment may be eligible for support. A variety of support may be available from sources in the com\u00ad munity, ranging from financial support to donations of time, expertise, used or low\u00adcost furniture and equipment, and space for a variety of activities. Some potential sources include Fundraisers. People who do fundraising can help the program develop a campaign. Many States and the District of Columbia require that charitable organizations regis\u00adter and report to a governmental authority before they solicit contributions in their jurisdiction. Foundations and local charities. A pro\u00ad gram may qualify as a recipient of funds for capital, operations, or other types of sup\u00adport such as board development from foun\u00addations, the Community Chest, United Way, or other charities. Financing and Organizational Issues 155 Alumni. Graduates from a program may donate money to the program or provide support for clients. Internships. Local colleges and universities may need internship slots for their students who are planning careers in human ser\u00advices. Volunteers. Some programs use volunteers in various capacities. Sources include local retirement organizations and faith\u00adbased agencies. Community groups. Faith\u00adbased agencies and community centers may let the program use rooms for meetings, alumni groups, recovery support groups, or classes. Community groups can contribute reading materials, clothes, toys for clients' children, furniture, or computers. Local stores and vendors. Local businesses may contribute useful supplies such as snacks, office supplies, or even computers. Research funding In addition to SAMHSA's other roles, such as technical assistance, helping communities use research findings to implement effective treat\u00ad ment programs, and funding of prevention and treatment, the institutes of the National Institutes of Health conduct research on best practices in substance abuse treatment. The Research Assistant (http://www.theresearchassistant.com) may be a helpful source for information. For current funding opportunities, visit the National Institute on Drug Abuse Web site (http://www.nida.nih.gov) and the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism Web site (http://www.niaaa.nih.gov). Grants Government agencies and private foundations offer funding through competitive grants. Grant money usually is designated for discrete projects, such as creating a videotape on family issues, providing childcare services in a pro\u00adgram for women, enhancing the cultural com\u00ad petence of staff members, or treating under\u00ad served populations. Writing grant applications requires special skills. A program can hire a consultant to write the application or use its own planning or research staff, if available. Successful grant applications address areas of genuine need, propose ideas worthy of support, express these ideas well, and explicitly follow the requirements of the request for applica\u00adtion or proposal. To design a fundable pro\u00adject, the program may need to establish links with other resources. Each donor agency or foundation has its own application format and requirements that should be followed exactly. It is especially important when using a consultant to have program staff closely involved in the process of developing a grant application to ensure that affirmations in the application are completely aligned with agen\u00adcy capabilities. Programs that fail to involve their own staff in the grant application pro\u00adcess risk falling into the \"implementation trap\" when a grant is awarded for projects they are not prepared to perform. SAMHSA offers a variety of resources to assist commu\u00adnity\u00adbased organizations and others in devel\u00adoping successful grant applications. See the text box on page 157 for sources of informa\u00adtion on grants for treatment and detoxifica\u00adtion programs. Self\u00adpay patients Some patients pay for some or all of a course of treatment themselves, without seeking reimbursement from a third\u00adparty payor. These patients may have no or inadequate third\u00adparty coverage for substance abuse treatment and are not eligible for public pay\u00adment sources. Some patients who have cover\u00adage may prefer to pay out of their own pock\u00adets due to concerns about the confidentiality of their information with their employer or others. 156 Chapter 6 Working in Today's Managed CareEnvironment All healthcare providers, including those who provide substance abuse treatment services,increasingly operate in a world in which careis managed in all sectors, both public and pri-vate. Among individuals covered by employ-er-sponsored benefits in 2003, 95 percentwere covered under managed care arrange-ments (Kaiser Family Foundation and HealthResearch and Educational Trust 2003). Thepenetration of managed care into employer-sponsored health plans is relatively new; asrecently as 1993, 46 percent were covered byindemnity plans. It is estimated that morethan 160 million Americans have their behav-ioral health care (treatment for substance use and mental disorders) covered by a managed behavioral health care organization (Oss and Clary 1999). Although managed care penetra- tion is lower in public programs than in employer-sponsored programs, it is still sig- nificant; in 2002, 58 percent of the Medicaidpopulation was enrolled in managed care arrangements (CMS 2002). Many States alsooperate MCOs not connected with Medicaidfor provision of substance abuse treatmentservices. Behavioral health care carve-outs, so namedbecause management of substance abusetreatment and mental health benefits are sep-arated (carved out) from the provision andmanagement of other healthcare services, arenow the dominant approach to managed carefor mental health treatment. However, this isnot the case for substance abuse; manybehavioral health carve-outs retain substanceabuse coverage in the medical MCO. The \"carve-in\" approach, which theoretically integrates traditional medical services withservices for substance use and other mentaldisorders, is re-emerging but as of 2004 wasstill relatively rare. Even when health planscarve-in substance abuse services, they oftenuse a subcontracted specialty vendor or aseparate internal division with specialtyexpertise to manage the carve-in benefits. MCOs are becoming more prevalent in thepublic sector. In 2002, 51 percent of all sub-stance abuse treatment facilities had con-tracts with MCOs and even 39 percent offacilities owned by State and local govern-ments had such contracts (Office of AppliedStudies 2002 b). By 1998, all but four States had implemented some form of managedbehavioral health care in their public sectortreatment programs. However there is widevariation among States and large counties inthe extent and form of reliance on managed 157 Financing and Organizational IssuesWhere To Get Information on Grants SAMHSA provides information about the grants it provides at http://www.samhsa.gov/grants/block-grants.

A distinct terminology has evolved in the managed care industry\u2014terms such as capi\u00adtation, network, or staff\u00admodel as well as a host of acronyms. Contracts Are Primary Tools Managed care arrangements have four funda\u00admental aspects with which all program admin\u00ad istrators should be familiar. First, an arrangement begins It is estimated that more than 160 million Americans have their behavioral health care (treatment for substance use and mental disorders) covered by a managed behavioral health care organization. with a managed care contract that specifies the obliga\u00ad tions of each party . It should be noted that small communi\u00adty providers mayhave little or no negotiating leverage in the contracting process; their only decision may bewhether or not to accept what is offered, including the rate of paymentand all other con\u00adtract provisions. Nevertheless, a clear and detailedunderstanding of the contract is required to ensure successful perfor\u00admance. One key aspect of any man\u00adaged care contract is the financial arrangement between the par\u00ad ties, including the basis for payment and the amount of risk assumed by each party, if any. Of course, some managed care contracts are not risk\u00adbased. It is important to have some\u00adone with expertise and experience in managed care contracts and financing examine any proposed contract and make certain that the financial components of the arrangement are well understood by the program staff who have financial responsibilities. Secondly, by negotiating and signing a man\u00adaged care contract, a detoxification program or its parent agency becomes a member of that MCO's managed care network. MCOs generally have a network of contracted and credentialed providers who supply services at a negotiated rate to members who are enrolled in the plans. Each organizational member of the network must satisfy the MCO's minimum requirements for licensure of staff, programs, and facilities to be eligible for a managed care contract. The third fundamental aspect of managed care arrangements is the requirement for per\u00adformance measurement and reporting. All MCOs apply a wide range of standard perfor\u00admance measures to each of their contracted providers and may have financial or referral incentives or disincentives associated with measured performance. Finally, the fourth aspect involves utilization management and case management. These tasks generally are performed by MCO staff, typically nurses or social workers, with supervision from Ph.D. clinicians or physi\u00adcians. The staff makes a determination of what services are \"medically necessary\" and therefore eligible for health plan reimburse\u00adments. Utilization management compares a provider's proposed treatment plan with simi\u00adlar or expected plans for individuals with sim\u00adilar conditions and diagnoses. The utilization management approach may vary not just by MCO but by MCO customer, with some cus\u00adtomers preferring that utilization be highly scrutinized and meet the test of medical necessity and others preferring that the MCO use a light touch in managing utilization. If a treatment plan from a detoxification program does not meet criteria for medical necessity, it is likely to be denied and referred to a higher level clinician for review, delaying approval and payment. It makes sense to obtain each MCO's protocols, as well as any specific 158 Chapter 6 arrangements and benefit plans for customers whose employees or enrollees are in the detoxification program's client population. Case management programs operated in the private sector often are utilization review programs rather than the clinical case man\u00adagement programs typical in the public sec\u00adtor. Moreover, the process of case manage\u00adment in the private sector often differs from the one found in traditional public sector mental health or substance abuse treatment agencies. Instead, it primarily involves tele\u00adphone contact, usually with a nurse, in high\u00adrisk or high\u00adcost cases. Case management usually is not performed onsite or in person in MCOs unless under contract to a public agency that requires this. If a detoxification program client has a public sector and a man\u00adaged care case manager, the detoxification program will have to interact with both to obtain initial and continuing approvals of treatment in what is called a case or utiliza\u00adtion management program. In general, programs will be required to obtain utilization management approval and/or case management approval for any proposed treatment plan before they can bill the MCO. Programs will have to bear the cost of pursuing denials and requesting exceptions as well. The more the program's staff can develop a relationship with the MCO's utiliza\u00adtion management and case management staff, the more they will learn about the internal criteria and protocols that drive approval or denial decisions and the more latitude they will have to request special arrangements for a particular client. Most MCOs and MBHOs have Web sites with provider portals. Once a program identifies the name of the managed care plan from which payment is to be requested staff should be sure to check its Web site. Some managed care plans offer electronic data interchange with network providers to facilitate claims submission. Elements of Financial Risk in Managed Care Contracts Cost of services To assess and negotiate a managed care con\u00adtract and to monitor a program's perfor\u00admance under that contract, it is imperative to know what it costs the detoxification program to provide each unit of service that is pro\u00adduced. The cost of services includes staff time spent with clients, administrative time spent on meetings and paperwork, and capital and operating expenses. Only when the actual cost of delivering a unit of a particular service is known can an agency negotiate a reasonable rate for specific services when negotiating contracts and a fiscally prudent arrangement. Determining the cost of services often entails many challenges but is absolutely essential in the current environment of accountability. See the text box on page 160 for a list of resources from the literature. Following are the recognized but evolving cost methodolo\u00adgies developed specifically for substance abuse services: The first systematic cost data collection method, the Drug Abuse Treatment Cost Analysis Program (DATCAP) (French 2003a, b), was developed in the early 1990s by economists at Research Triangle Institute (French et al. 1997). The Treatment Services Review used with DATCAP provides unit ser\u00ad vice costs (French et al. 2000). The Uniform System of Accounting and Cost Reporting for Substance Abuse Treatment Providers is a cost estimation method developed about the same time by CSAT (1998 d). Another estimation approach has been developed by Yates (1996, 1999): the Cost-Procedure-Process-Outcome Analysis. Anderson and colleagues (1998) have devel\u00ad oped a cost of service methodology.

Evaluation and Program Planning 27(1):35-43, 2004. 160 Chapter 6 The Substance Abuse Services Cost Analysis Program (Zarkin et al. 2004) is an emerging treatment services cost estimation method. Variants of these methods have been applied to several treatment studies (Flynn et al. 2003; Koenig et al. 1999; Mojtabai and Zivin 2003). Three major categories of financial arrange\u00adments may be distinguished in managed care contracts: (1) fee\u00adfor\u00adservice agreements, (2) capitation agreements, and (3) case rate agreements. Program administrators need to understand the differences among these types of arrangements so they can manage financial risk. Sometimes, administrators may think that the contract itself is the goal. However, the existence of a contract is no guarantee of a referral; it only enables referrals that are medically necessary. The closer the relation\u00adship the program staff can develop with a given MCO, the easier it will be for them to understand their clinical criteria, to obtain more than intermittent referrals, and to nego\u00adtiate a financial arrangement for the program that is reasonable and fair. Managed care contracts vary according to two principal dimensions: (1) the method of pay\u00adment and the corresponding type of risk assumed by the provider, and (2) the amount of payment. Each of the three major types of financial arrangements or methods of pay\u00adment (described in Figure 6\u00ad1, p. 162) is asso\u00adciated with major financial risks that providers should be aware of in negotiating each type. Risk, of course, is a continuous variable, so that no arrangement is devoid of any risk whatsoever. The key is to ensure that a program has the tools and capabilities to manage the risks it assumes. Many managed care systems rely on fee\u00adfor\u00adservice arrange\u00ad ments with providers, so that most providers are paid on a discounted fee\u00adfor\u00adservice basis, based on a schedule of fees described in the contract. Capitation agreements usually are reserved for very large networks of providers, who in turn pay individual providers on a fee\u00adfor\u00adservice basis. For more information on managed care pur\u00adchasing and negotiation from the perspective of a purchaser, see TAP 22, Contracting for Managed Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services: A Guide for Public Purchasers (CSAT 1998c). Networks, Accreditation, and Credentialing To join an MCO's network of providers and negotiate a contract specific MCO minimum standards for staff credentials and program accreditation must be met. These minimum standards generally are not negotiable because they have their basis in that MCO's accreditation requirements. The provider credentialing requirements vary by MCO and by customer within the MCO and often include primary verification of specific aca\u00addemic degrees or specific levels of licensure for staff, as well as verified minimum levels of malpractice insurance. Some MCOs may use what are called independent Credentialing Verification Organizations (CVOs) for this process. These CVOs verify the credentials of providers on behalf of MCOs to ensure, for example, that their licenses are valid and up to date. MCOs sometimes are not familiar with sub\u00ad stance abuse treatment and, moreover, typi\u00adcally include only those types of providers that are licensed by a given State to engage in private practice in their provider networks. Usually such providers are licensed in psy\u00adchology, nursing, medicine, or social work. MCOs explain that this has to do with mal\u00adpractice insurance issues. This credentialing practice has a disproportionate impact on those substance abuse treatment providers that do not have as many staff with these cre\u00addentials as do mental health providers, by presenting an obstacle to contracting with these MCOs. However, it is not an insur\u00admountable obstacle. Substance abuse treat\u00adment providers often must help MCOs under\u00adstand the substance abuse treatment environ\u00adment, the types of providers that deliver ser\u00ad Financing and Organizational Issues 161 Figure 6\u00ad1 Financial Arrangements for Providers Method of Reimbursemen t Cautions/Risks for Programs Fee\u00adfor\u00adService Agreement. Fee\u00adfor\u00adservice pro\u00ad grams are the least risky to providers. They gen\u00ad erally require precertification and utilization management for some or all procedures and ser\u00advices. The client's benefit plan document or the public payor's contract dictate the services that may be approved. In a fee\u00adfor\u00adservice contract, a rate is received for the services provided; typical\u00adly, a standard program session with specific ser\u00advices bundled in. This is referred to as an \"all\u00ad inclusive rate.\" Some common bundled services are urine drug screens and group, family, and individual counsel\u00ading. Thus the payment rate for one visit may include a 50\u00adminute group counseling session and a urine drug screen. The rate for a day of treat\u00adment could include, for example, one\u00adfifth of a 25\u00adminute psychologist visit, one\u00adhalf of a urine drug screen, one\u00adhalf of a vocational training session, and two sessions of group counseling. The assumption is that these services will occur at a specified frequency during the course of the client's treatment. Psychiatric services can be incorporated into the bundled services, but usual\u00adly they are negotiated separately and treated as an additional service. When negotiating a fee\u00adfor\u00adservice contract, an administrator needs to ensure that the rate is suf\u00adficient to cover the actual costs to a program of providing the specified services. During negotia\u00adtions, the MCO has the option of saying that it will not pay for some of the bundled services. All ser\u00advices should be costed out prior to negotiation, so actual costs of treatment components are known and can be compared to the reimbursement offered. Programs must understand that even if a fee\u00adfor\u00adservice contract is successfully negotiated, referrals may or may not follow. vices, and the qualifications and standards they must meet so that the MCO can modify its policies appropriately. MCOs often are more willing to contract with organizations that have a facility license from their State than with individual substance abuse treat\u00adment providers who may not possess creden\u00ad tials that meet the MCO's licensure criteria. Many managed care plans have separate provider networks for behavioral health ser\u00ad vices. It is important for detoxification providers to participate in both medical and behavioral health networks, given that detoxi\u00adfication benefits may be considered either medical or behavioral benefits. In addition to the credentials of the staff and practitioners, the program itself may have to be accredited by one of the major national health\u00adcare accrediting organizations. These include the Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities, the National Committee for Quality Assurance and the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations .In general, accreditation from CARF is consi dered most important by sub\u00ad stance abuse treatment providers for their 162 Chapter 6 Figure 6\u00ad1 (continued) Financial Arrangements for Providers Method of Reimbursemen t Cautions/Risks for Programs Capitation Agreement. A managed care company may establish a stipulated dollar amount to cover treatment costs for a group of people using one per\u00adperson rate for everyone, which is the MCO's capitation rate. The MCO may then subcapitate a stipulated dollar amount to a treatment provider or organization, and the MCO and the treatment provider negotiate an agreement in which the provider is paid a fixed amount per subscriber per month, rather than billing on a fee\u00adfor\u00adservice basis. The provider agrees to provide all or some of the treatment services for an expected number of managed care \"covered lives\" (e.g., for 100,000 subscribers). Usually only large service providers have the assets and volume of services to engage in capitated agreements. The two critical elements are the per member/per month (pm/pm) rate and the utilization rate. If many more people than are predicted require treatment, the provider may not be able to cover service delivery costs, much less make a profit/sur\u00adplus. The key is to have reliable information on the historical use rates of a given managed care plan's enrollees. If the provider bears in mind these caveats, this regular, guaranteed payment can be an excellent arrangement but carries with it the risks of both \"overutilization\" (when com\u00ad pared to the assumption used in developing the rate) and the need for a greater intensity of treat\u00adment than the capitation rate can cover. In some cases a program may want to accept a somewhat speculative capitation rate in order to join a panel and then renegotiate that rate after the program has collected data that show that it needs a higher rate to cover its costs. In any case, it is crucial to track actual dollars against the budget in real time to avoid unexpected deficits. Case Rate Agreement. The case rate is a fixed rate per client paid for delivery of specific ser\u00advices to specified types of consumers. For this fee, a provider such as a clinic covers all the services that a client requires for a specific period. In essence, the MCO is saying, \"You provide the client what he needs from this set of services and I will pay you this set amount.\" What usually dis\u00ad tinguishes case rate from capitation is that essen\u00ad tially all of the case rate clients are anticipated to be receiving some service; that is, at least case management. Usually those receiving services under capitation are a small minority of those covered. The case rate may be \"risk\u00adadjusted\" to compensate for the higher costs of serving clients who predictably need more services than average. A case rate agreement removes some of the utiliza\u00ad tion risk from the service provider. However, the risk remains that clients will need services more frequently or at higher levels than the case rate covers. It is essential that programs track costs by specific client in order to assess the adequacy of a proposed case rate. However, it is a mistake to consider a case rate as a cap for any specific patient; the goal is to ensure that the average cost per case is lower than the negotiated case rate, not that the cost for each case is less than the negotiat\u00aded rate. Once again, it is crucial to track actual average dollars per case against the contracted case rate in real time to avoid unexpected deficits. Financing and Organizational Issues 163 programs. However, providers that wish to offer inpatient detoxification services general\u00adly must obtain accreditation from JCAHO to meet the requirements of most MCOs. Organizational Performance Measurement Performance measurement is becoming an increasingly important component of man\u00ad aged and fee\u00adfor\u00adservice care in both the public and private sectors. SAMHSA's SAPT Block Grants now require the collection of measures of program performance and out\u00ad comes. MCOs have their own performance measures established by the agencies that accredit them, such as the NCQA. Their cus\u00ad tomers, employers, or public purchasers may use adequacy of performance on these mea\u00ad sures in their decisions to acquire or retain their plans for their employees. NCQA has established a set of measures specifically relating to substance abuse and mental health treatment services for all the MCOs that it accredits, including new measures of the identification of enrollees with substance abuse diagnoses, the rate of initiation of treatment, and a measure of treatment engagement. Programs will be asked to par\u00ad ticipate in measuring these indicators and report that information to the MCO, and doing so will likely be a condition of the con\u00ad tract. The MCO may reward good perfor\u00ad mance with an additional fee. Similarly, MCOs evaluate the performance of the members of their provider network. Each MCO has its own measures and procedures for implementation, some of which are pre\u00adscribed by the organizations that accredit them. Not all MCOs are diligent about this provider evaluation process. Only a few MCOs have implemented sophisticated mea\u00ad surement systems, and some of the methods used today may be crude but they still are required. Nevertheless, regardless of how simple or complex they may be, the results of external performance measures implemented by MCOs can be extremely important to a program's financial and organizational suc\u00adcess, affecting a program's ability to remain a viable, respected network provider. Some performance management systems implement\u00aded by MCOs also use financial incentives and/or disincentives keyed to performance. Regardless of the specific measures imple\u00ad mented by particular MCOs, well\u00admanaged organizations will also develop and use their own internal performance measures and con\u00adstantly strive to improve their own perfor\u00admance. Among these should be measures of both process and outcomes, such as The percentage of clients who complete a defined treatment regimen that meets their individual needs The percentage of clients who drop out of treatment in the first 7 days following treat\u00ad ment initiation The percentage of clients who remain in doc\u00ad umented but less intensive treatment 30 days after discharge from the program The percentage of clients who are employed or attending school 6 months after discharge from the program When using performance measures, it is impor\u00ad tant for programs to account for differences among clients that may affect measured results, such as a client's previous history of abuse or medical conditions. Nevertheless, it is equally important to recognize that employing mea\u00ad surement is an integral component of external and internal accountability as well as continu\u00ad ous clinical improvement. One of the primary independent entities involved in the construction of national per\u00adformance measures for substance abuse treat\u00adment is the Washington Circle Group. NCQA's new substance abuse performance measures on identification and initiation of treatment and treatment engagement were developed by the WCG over a 4\u00adyear period. 164 Chapter 6 They have identified four major \"domains\" for substance abuse treatment measures: 1. Prevention/Education 2. Recognition or Identification of Substance Abuse 3. Treatment Initiation of alcohol and other plan ser\u00ad vices Linkage of detoxification and alcohol and other drug plan services Treatment engagement Use of interventions for family members and significant others 4. Maintenance of Treatment Effects These and other substance abuse performance measures are now used in NCQA's MCO accreditation process. The WCG and others have defined a variety of such measures and administrators should think of these measures as ways to improve their own performance, as an essential element in the reporting system, and as a means for documenting success to their customers and other stakeholders. Performance measurement is becoming increasingly important outside of managed care contracts as well as inside them. For example, as mentioned in the previous section on fund\u00ad ing, SAMHSA began integrating performance measurement into the SAPT Block Grant as of fiscal year 2004. Each State will expect pro\u00ad grams to understand and be able to measure the required indicators accurately and in a timely way. One of the most important performance mea\u00ad sures in the future for detoxification programs is likely to be linkages to substance abuse treat\u00ad ment following detoxification (Mark et al. 2002). Research has shown that patients who receive continuing care following detoxification have better outcomes in terms of drug absti\u00ad nence and readmission rates than those who do not receive continuing care. This focus on link\u00ad ages is a likely result of research indicating that many people who undergo detoxification do not receive subsequent substance abuse services from the formal treatment system and that the lack of substance abuse treatment following detoxification has been getting worse instead of better (Mark et al. 2002). It is incumbent on providers of detoxification services to ensure that clients are linked to substance abuse treat\u00ad ment following detoxification. Recordkeeping and manage\u00ad ment information systems Like indemnity insurers, MCOs also require detailed records of services provided to clients in order for them to pay for ser\u00ad Performance measurement is becoming an increasingly important compo\u00ad nent of managed and fee\u00adfor\u00adservice care in both the public and private sectors. vices received. The program's account\u00ading system needs to track counselors' time spent on the phone, on paper\u00adwork, and directly with clients. Clinical records should reflect accurately the claims records submitted to the MCO. Periodically, payors and MCOs may audit the clini\u00adcal records to ensure that the ser\u00advices billed for actu\u00adally have been pro\u00advided. Failure to adequately docu\u00ad ment clinical ser\u00ad vices can result in nonpayment and put a con\u00ad tract in jeopardy. On the other hand, individ\u00ad uals' private information and identity must be handled in a confidential manner pursuant to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Federal con\u00ad fidentiality requirements for persons with substance abuse. Financing and Organizational Issues 165 Managing multiple contracts requires sophis\u00ad ticated management, a fiscal management information system (MIS), and constant scrutiny. The need for information is even more crucial for capitation\u00adbased arrange\u00adments that place risk on the service provider than it is for fee\u00adfor\u00adservice arrangements. In essence, the MIS needs to be capable of two\u00adway information transfer between the MCO and the program. Data such as membership, benefits, copays, deductible amounts, and other financial information must be passed between the pro\u00adgram and the Successfully addressing the needs of the utilization and case management staff at MCOs is a critical element in the relationship with an MCO. insured entity or payor. The MIS also should be able to analyze key per\u00adformance data for internal and exter\u00adnal reports. The MIS must pass use\u00adful data to staff members responsi\u00adble for managing benefits and pro\u00adviding services. Program data will need to meet State data requirements as well as require\u00adments by each payor, while respecting confiden\u00adtiality. Managing payment from multiple funding streams Especially in the public arena, multiple con\u00ad tracts with and grants from several funding streams and payors may be used to support services for a single client. These contracts will specify order of payment. The provider needs to manage the funds carefully and appropriately to be in compliance with con\u00ad tracts and grants. For example, a contract with a drug court may specify that Medicaid should be billed as payor number one and the drug court as payor number two. Any unpaid portion might then be billed to the block grant agency as payor of last resort, if it is an eligible service under the block grant. Some providers have successfully used the strategy of first using the reimbursement of those pay\u00adors with the most restrictive array of services; later, the more flexible funds can be used to cover the remaining services. A clearly docu\u00admented strategy for managing payment that is communicated effectively to the accounts payable staff is critical and will help pro\u00adgrams be successful in this important area. Utilization and Case Management All MCOs use methods to manage the service utilization of their members and ensure that they are receiving the most appropriate array of services in the most appropriate environ\u00adment or level of care for the appropriate length of time. Although technically, utiliza\u00adtion management focuses on a single type of service and case management focuses on the coordination of the appropriate array of ser\u00advices needed by a specific individual, in prac\u00adtice the same individual professionals may be responsible for both types of management. Utilization and case management staff at an MCO authorize specific services for purposes of payment. A wide variety of specific criteria and protocols may be used to determine whether services may be authorized for sub\u00adstance abuse, typically including the American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) patient placement criteria (ASAM 2001) and other level of care or diagnosis\u00adbased criteria sets. Successfully addressing the needs of the uti\u00adlization and case management staff at MCOs responsible for authorizing care is a critical element in the relationship with an MCO and in maintaining the program's clinical and financial viability. To do so, program staff must understand what their counterparts do and be well trained in conducting professional 166 Chapter 6 relationships over the telephone, be familiar with the criteria and protocols employed by the MCOs with which the program has con\u00adtracts, and have easy access to the multitude of clinical and service information required by an MCO to help them complete a review and authorize services. Excellent records are essential. Program staff also should be famil\u00adiar with each MCO's appeal or exceptions process for those occasions when the outcome of a first\u00adlevel review is unsatisfactory. Utilization management cannot proceed if the program is not recognized as an eligible net\u00adwork provider; the program will have to ensure that it is an accepted network provider before it can participate in the uti\u00adlization management or case management process. Strengthening the Financial Base and Market Position of a Program The following strategies may strengthen the market position of a detoxification program to facilitate both larger numbers of patients and greater revenues per patient: Achieve recognition for the quality and effectiveness of services. If a program has a reputation for providing effective care, then managed care enrollees and other potential clients will want to use it. A pro\u00adgram can be of value to a client, a purchas\u00ader, and/or an MCO if it can reduce repeated detoxification, repeated treatment, and re\u00adadmissions, and thus manage unnecessary costs and interventions. Effective substance abuse treatment provided promptly may reduce medical care and hospitalization costs in the long run. A program that effec\u00adtively manages the care of high\u00adutilization substance abuse clients by also providing psychiatric treatment, case management, and housing support is a good candidate for \"preferred\" or \"core\" status with one or several MCOs or MBHOs. Of course, the additional costs of these services need to be a component of a program's rate and con\u00adtract. Having highly reputable, recognized, and efficient providers is a major marketing and regulatory advantage for the health plan, as well as for the program. All these program characteristics can be marketing advantages. Programs also may apply to SAMHSA's National Registry of Evidence\u00adbased Programs and Practices, which recog\u00ad nizes model, effective, and promising pro\u00ad grams. Check SAMHSA's Web site to find out how to apply for this status, which is a major achievement and marketing asset. Serve specific populations. Providing low\u00ad cost, high\u00adquality treatment to a population no other program serves (e.g., adolescents, clients with HIV/AIDS, clients with co\u00adoccurring mental disorders, pregnant women, women with young children, clients who are deaf) also is a possible marketing advantage. Treating these clients can result in client referrals from a larger geographic area and multiple sources. Such clients may bring with them higher reimbursement rates too, but this also may simply reflect higher costs to provide care to the population. Using special capabilities to attract clients is a good idea, but not at the cost of inade\u00adquate payment for services. Develop economies of scale. Adding clinic sites or increasing the number of branch clinics may permit spreading some fixed costs (e.g., management, information, financial systems, executive staff) among a larger number of patients, thus driving down a program's per capita costs. However, larger size requires greater administrative coordination, which itself can be costly. Gain community visibility and support. Having governmental, community agency executives, or political figures (e.g., the mayor, council members) as board members raises the program's profile in the commu\u00adnity. Of course, programs should be sure to include board members who have specific Financing and Organizational Issues 167 skills and connections that will advance the purposes of the detoxification program. Form alliances with other treatment providers. Setting up coalitions to compete with or work with MCOs and other pur\u00adchasers such as Medicaid may be useful. However, consultation with an attorney is strongly advised prior to developing such a coalition or other collaboration with local treatment providers as the laws regarding antitrust and other matters related to such relationships are complex. For programs serving publicly funded clients, technical assistance may be available through SAMHSA; the SSA can provide details. Preparing for the Future Major forces that shape and limit provider financing are unlikely to change substantially in the near future. Careful strategic planning and assurance of funding from reputable and varied referral sources are essential for new and existing programs. As a buffer against shrinking budgets, all programs should con\u00adsider broadening their funding streams and referral sources, expanding the range of clients they can serve, and promptly referring clients for other services not provided on site. Partnerships can be a critical factor to the financial success of a program. To operate effectively, administrators and other staff must thoroughly understand the managed care and community political environment including its terminology, contracts, negotia\u00adtions, payments, appeals, and priority popu\u00adlations. A successful working relationship with an MCO, a health plan, other pur\u00adchasers, or with another agency or group of agencies depends on day\u00adto\u00adday interactions in which staff members serve as informed, professional advocates for their clients and the program. 168 Chapter 6 Appendix A: Bibliography Abbott, P.J.

Treatment Improvement Protocols (TIPs) are the products of a systematic and innovative process that brings together clinicians, researchers, program managers, policymakers, and other Federal and non-Federal experts to reach consensus on state-of-the-art treatment practices. TIPsare developed under the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's (SAMHSA's) Knowledge Application Program (KAP)to improve the treatment capabilities of the Nation's alcohol and drug abuse treatment service system. What Is a Quick Guide? A Quick Guide clearly and concisely presents the primary information from a TIP in a pocket-sized booklet. Each Quick Guide isdivided into sections to help readers quickly locate relevant material. Some contain glossaries of terms or lists of resources. Pagenumbers from the original TIP are referenced so providers can refer back to the source document for more information. What Are KAP Keys? Also based on TIPs, KAP Keys are handy, durable tools. Keys may include assessment or screening in-struments, checklists, andsummaries of treatment phases. Printed on coated paper, each KAP Keys set is fastened together with a key ring and can be keptwithin a treatment provider's reach and consulted fre-quently. The Keys allow you, the busy clinician or program administrator, tolocate information easily and to use this information to enhance treatment services.
