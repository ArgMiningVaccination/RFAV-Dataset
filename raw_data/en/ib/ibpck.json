It is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. It is the leading cause of non-traumatic disability in young adults. The clinical course of the disease is quite variable, ranging from stable chronic disease to rapidly evolving debilitating disease. The pathogenesis of MS is not fully understood. Still, there has been a rapid shift in understanding the immune pathology of MS away from pure T cell-mediated disease to B cells and microglia/astrocytes having a vital role in the pathogenesis of MS. This has helped in the emergence of new therapies for management. Effective treatment of MS requires a multidisciplinary approach to manage acute attacks, prevent relapses and disease progression and treat the disabling symptoms associated with the disease. In this review, we discuss the pathogenesis of MS, management of acute relapses, disease-modifying therapies in MS, new drugs and drugs currently in trial for MS and the symptomatic treatment of MS. All language search was conducted on Google Scholar, PubMed, MEDLINE, and Embase till February 2022. The following search strings and medical subheadings (MeSH) were used: \"Multiple Sclerosis\", \"Pathogenesis of MS\", and \"Disease-modifying therapies in MS\". We explored literature on the pathogenic mechanisms behind MS, management of acute relapses, disease-modifying therapies in MS and symptomatic management.", "sitename": "Cureus", "date": "2022-05-10", "cleaned_text": "On May 25, 2018, the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) went into effect and changed how organizations deal with personal data of customers located in the EU.
