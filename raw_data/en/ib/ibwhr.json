Probiotics are good bacteria that confer a health benefit. Prebiotics are fibers that when digested help to feed and fuel a healthy gut lining. The combination of Probiotics and Prebiotics are called Synbiotics. Synbiotics are the key to a healthy gut. A biofilm is a collection of microbes that grows in communities to form protective extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), or matrices, to surround themselves. There are two types of biofilm communities: symbiotic and pathogenic. Symbiotic biofilms are produced by our good bugs and protect our gut lining. Bad bugs, however, produce pathogenic biofilms. In basic definition, Apraxia results from a dysfunction of the cerebral hemispheres of the brain, especially the parietal lobe, and can arise from many diseases or damage to the brain. This means that we have to find a way to support and intentionally engage the cerebral hemispheres where there may be defects from underlying medical challenges.
