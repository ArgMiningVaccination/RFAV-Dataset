Hi all, I have ADHD and often struggle to get my mind to relax when I try to meditate. I know, I know- the important part of meditation is noticing the thoughts and letting them go. But I have SO many thoughts. ALL the time. It's super distracting and overwhelming at times. Has anyone found any herbs/ teas that have helped them calm their mind "}
