Widespread Use of Acetaminophen Bob, a 49-year-old construction worker comes to the emergency department with nausea and vomiting that has lasted for two days. He admits to social drinking of 2 beers nightly after work and 4 on weekends for the past 20 years. He states he has been taking 8 tablets of Tylenol daily for the past 2 weeks for pain in his right knee and lower back after a recent fall. He think he may have the flu because he just \"doesn't feel good\" and keeps vomiting. Upon physical assessment his skin looks pale yellow and he's dehydrated. His right knee is swollen and red. If this patient were your assignment, what labs would you expect to be ordered? What would be your focused physical assessment? What is the primary problem? What is the causative factors? What diagnosis do you suspect? What Is acetaminophen? Acetaminophen is a non-narcotic analgesic and fever reducer. It is available by prescription or over the counter (OTC). Millions of people use over-the-counter (OTC) pain relievers every day to treat minor aches and pains. Usually these medicines are safe and effective, but they can be dangerous and even deadly when they are not taken as directed. That is particularly important with acetaminophen, which is used to reliev e pain or reduce fever (FDA, 2017).Acetaminophen, also called paracetamol , is sold b y man y names including ylenol, P anadol, Ofirmev , Acephn, used fev er, muscle pain, neck pain, plantar fasciitis, sciatica, and common body aches and pains. It is abbreviated as AP AP (for acetyl-par a-aminophenol), which is the chemical name, and it is known b y 28 band names in the United States (Ma yo, 2017). It is commonly used in combination drugs for pain as a nonnarcotic analgesic and known as Ex cedrin, Goody' s Body is included O TC medications for acute cold symptoms, respir atory conditions, and headaches. In addition, it is a component of some narcotic prescriptions. Acetaminophen can be used as a sole medication or as an activ e ingredient in man y OTC and prescription medicines. Acetaminophen is gener ally safe at recommended doses, but if taken in larger dosages or frequency , it can cause serious and ev en fatal liv er damage. In fact, acetaminophen poisoning is a leading cause of liv er failure in this country (Goldberg, 2017). Acetaminophen Tablets (Generic and Trade) Acetaminophen is available in both generic and trade-named products. Image Source: Google Images. Acetaminophen is very effectiv e in relieving pain and fev er, which promotes its popularit y. It is the generic name of a drug found in hundreds of O TC products including Tylenol, cough and cold medicines, and sleep aids, as well as prescription pain reliev ers such as Vicodin and P ercocet. Howev er, it is not alw ays clear to the consumer that these other named medications contain acetaminophen. If more than one medication is tak en that contains this drug, consumers ma y inadv ertently take more than the recommended dose. Because the risks of acetaminophen-related liv er damage are so serious and because the public is often una ware of these risks, the leadership of the National Council for Prescription Drug Progr ams (NCPDP), the F ood and Drug Administr ation' s (FDA) Safe Use Initiativ e, and a broad group of stak eholders came together in 2011 to form the Acetaminophen Best Pr actices T ask Group , which produced Version 1.0 of a white paper ,* and an update in 2013 (FDA, 2013). *White paper: an authoritative report or guide helping readers to understand an issue, solve a problem, or make a decision. The recommendations are intended to mak e it easier for consumers to (1) identif y that their prescription pain reliev er contains acetaminophen, (2) compare activ e ingredients on their prescription and O TC labels, and (3) tak e action to a void taking two medicines with acetaminophen. One str ategy recommended matching the prescription container labeling with the labeling that already exists for O TC medicines that contain acetaminophen, providing consistency in labeling across all acetaminophen-containing medicines. The FDA white paper recommends: Complete spelling of acetaminophen and all other activ e ingredients on the pharmacy labels of all acetaminophen-containing prescription medicine and eliminating the use of abbreviations, acron yms, or other shortened v ersions for activ e ingredients A standardiz ed liv er warning label A standardiz ed warning label for drugs that ma y inter act with acetaminophen Formatting and wording on pharmacy container labels consistent with plain language and health liter acy principles A stak eholder call to action: \"adopt, implement, adhere, communicate and educate\" (FDA, 2013) Acetaminophen, the activ e ingredient in T ylenol, is also known as par acetamol and N- acetyl-p-aminophenol (AP AP). It has been mark eted in the United States as an O TC antipyretic (fev er reducing) and analgesic (pain reducing) agent since 1953 (Wikipedia, 2018a). Acetaminophen is widely a vailable in a v ariety of strengths and formulations for children and adults as a single-ingredient product.Open bottles of Extra Strength Tylenol and Extra Strength Tylenol PM, pain relievers with the active ingredient acetaminophen/paracetamol. Tylenol PM (the white-and-blue tablets) also contains leep aid. Image Source: Wi kimedia Commons.In United States acetaminophen is a vailable as 325 milligr am (mg) and 500 mg prepar ations and as a 650 mg extended-release medication intended for arthritis treatment. It comes in man y forms, including drops, capsules, and pills, as well as v arious children' s dissolv able, chew able, and liquid formulations (Medical Dictionary , 2018). It is a vailable in man y forms, including solutions, tablets, suppository , powder , capsule, syrup , suspension, elixir , and efferv escent tablets. Acetaminophen is added to man y combination prescription narcotic drugs (Vicodin, P ercocet) in order to give more pain relief with a minimiz ed dose of the addictiv e narcotic component. It can also be found in combination with other activ e ingredients in what are called combination medicines that treat symptoms of colds and flu, allergies, and sleeplessness.

What are the common br and names for acetaminophen?APAP or par acetamol. A. Indomethacin.B. Cialis. D.Action of Acetaminophen How does acetaminophen work to reduce fever and pain? Acetaminophen is used generally for mild to moderate pain relief and fever reduction. It produces analgesic effects by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes that catalyze the conversion of arachidonic acid, a fatty acid in cell membranes, to prostaglandins that produce pain, inflammation, and fever. There are two well-studied isoforms, called COX-1 and COX-2. The isoform COX-1 helps with the synthesis of prostaglandins responsible for protection of the stomach lining, while COX-2 mediates the synthesis of prostaglandins responsible for pain and inflammation. Acetaminophen is a relatively greater selective inhibitor of COX-2 enzymes than COX-1 (Drahl, 2014), similar to Celebrex (celecoxib). Its antipyretic, fever reducing effects are thought to arise from its actions against COX enzymes in the central nervous system, reducing the amount of prostaglandin E2 in the CNS and thereby lowering the temperature set point in the hypothalamus part of the brain. Its anti-inflammatory properties are much weaker than those of aspirin and other non- steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen, which inhibit both and COX-2 and can irritate the stomach and gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Acetaminophen is thus less effective or appropriate for chronic inflammatory pain conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, Lupus or Cohn's; however, it is an excellent choice for osteoarthritis, especially in those patients where aspirin is contr aindicated, such as in patients with an aspirin/salicylates allergy or peptic ulcers and other GI sensitivities. Acetaminophen lacks the antithrombotic, blood-thinning properties of aspirin and other NSAIDS, therefore does not inhibit coagulation, an important consideration for pain therapy following minor surgical or dental procedures.Image Source: Wi kimedia Commons. Side Effects of Acetaminophen All medications ha ve desired action for which the medication is being tak en but also ha ve unwanted side effects, and possibly additional adv erse reactions (Drugs.com). The desired effects of acetaminophen are fev er-reducing and pain relief , but man y people ma y also experience: Dark urine Itching Jaundice Loss of appetite Nausea Upper stomach pain Online Resource Ibuprofen vs. Acetaminophen: What's the Difference? (Video Failure Acetaminophen (APAP, paracetamol) has excellent bioavailability when taken orally and is almost completely absorbed by passive transport in the small intestine. Peak plasma concentrations occur at 30 to 60 minutes with a half-life of approximately 2 hours for therapeutic doses as it becomes distributed fairly evenly throughout the body (except for fat tissue). Acetaminophen is usually metabolized and inactivated in the liver by adding glucuronidate or sulfate groups to the molecule for increased solubility and excretion via the kidney (Toyoda et al., 2017) (see figure in next section). A small amount is acted on by the cytochrome P450 enzymes, CYP2E1 and CYP1A2, to generate the toxic compound, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI) (Pascal, 2017; Yang, 2017). Under normal conditions, the liver will detoxify the NAPQI intermediate by adding a glutathione group with the enzyme glutathione-S-transferase (GST), leading to subsequent excretion through the kidney (see figure). A safety warning for people who have chronic and elevated alcohol use, those who take isoniazid for tuberculosis, or those who take St. John's wort, acetaminophen may induce elevated levels of the CYP2E1 enzymes and generate relatively more of the toxic NAPQI compound, depleting the liver's store vs. Acetaminophen: What's The Dif ......This can result in a higher level of reactive oxygen and eventual necrosis in liver cells (Jaeschke et al., 2012). Likewise, in cases of overdose, intentional or not, the levels of acetaminophen can increase for up to 4 hours, and the NAPQI produced can satur ate the GSH detoxification pathway and spill over to cause liver and renal toxicity. The NAPQI compound is toxic because it chemically reacts with other proteins and DNA in the cell, destroying their activity and eventually the mitochondrial function that generates ATP energy (Jaeschke, 2012). Acute liver toxicity may exhibit clinical symptoms of severe stomach pains, nausea, vomiting, and upper-right-quadrant abdominal sensitivity, leading some to naively take more acetaminophen for pain relief. Liver failure may happen several days after an overdose, and unfortunately the patient may assume the overdose has been resolved, leaving only immediate liver transplant as a saving option. Paracetamol/Acetaminophen Metabolism Image Source: Wikimedia Commons. Our patient Bob has remained in the ED for testing, and results show the following: Vital signs: T, 99.4F; BP, 142/88; R, 20; P, 98.Labs: Liver enzymes AL T 558 AST 525 bilirubin 41 glucose blood acetaminophen 58 17 \u00b5mol/L 50 0 The admitting diagnosis is acetaminophen to xicity and Bob is admitted to the hospital. He is given an IV D5W for h ydration and giv en N- acetylcysteine (NAC) as the antidote for acetaminophen o verdose. What put our patient at risk for this? Due to his fall and resultant knee pain he had been self-medicating with a higher than normal dose of acetaminophen. In addition, due to his high alcohol intak e, the liv er was not able to metaboliz e the high doses of acetaminophen and created hepatoto xicity. Patient education and stabilization will be done before he can be discharged. His knee will also require a workup , evaluation, treatment, and appropriate pain management. Recommended Dosage Due to data that rev ealed unintentional o verdoses of acetaminophen, in 2011 the U .S. Food and Drug Administr ation (FDA) ask ed drug mak ers to limit the amount of acetaminophen in prescription combination pain reliev ers. The goal is to reduce accidental overdoses and the sev ere liv er injury that can follow . This request is hoped to limit the amount of acetaminophen in these products to 325 mg per tablet, capsule, or other dosage unit, making these products safer for patients (FDA, 2014). A Boxed Warning highlighting the potential for sev ere liv er injury and a W arning highlighting the potential for allergic reactions (eg, swelling of the face, mouth, and throat; difficult y breathing; itching or r ash) are being added to the label of all prescription drug products that contain acetaminophen. Manufacturers must also update the labels of all prescription products containing acetaminophen with a Bo xed Warning on the risk of sev ere liver injury if too much acetaminophen is tak en or consumed with alcohol (FDA, 2011). The new dose restriction does not apply to o ver-the-counter (O TC) pain reliev ers and cold medicines that contain acetaminophen. Normally , the maximum lev el allowed for these products is 500 mg, although a few extended- action pain reliev ers that are tak en less frequently can go up to 650 mg (FDA, 2011).The dosage requirement affects doz ens of prescription analgesics that contain both acetaminophen and another ingredient, t ypically opioids such as codeine, o xycodone, and hydrocodone. Some of these combination products now ha ve as much as 750 mg of acetaminophen per dose. Patients prescribed analgesics with acetaminophen at doses abo ve 325 mg can safely continue to tak e them under a ph ysician' s supervision. The k ey to safet y is not ex ceeding the maximum daily dose of 4000 mg, whether it comes in the form of prescription medications, O TC medications, or both (FDA, 2017). Although the FDA is considering decreasing the maximum recommended dose of acetaminophen, the currently recommended dose for adults and children o ver 12 y ears of age is 650 mg to 1000 mg ev ery 4 to 6 hours as needed, but not to ex ceed 4000 mg in a 24-hour period. The recommended dose of extr a-strength acetaminophen (which contains 500 mg per tablet) is 1000 mg ev ery 4 to 6 hours (Medical Dictionary , 2018). Did You Know . . . Two extr a- strength acetaminophen tablets tak en more than 4 times a day will produce an o verdose, and it only tak es a few da ys of ex ceeding the maximum dose to cause at least some liv er damage. If the patient also consumes alcohol, the risk of damage increases further . Because of this increased risk, the maximum dose of acetaminophen for a person who consumes more than two alcoholic drinks a da y should be decreased to 2 gr ams per da y (Medical Dictionary , 2018). Answers: C,BTest Your Knowledge The current recommended maximum 24-hour dose of T ylenol for adults is: People who consume more than two alcoholic drinks per da y should: Pediatric doses are based on age and weight, usually 10 to 15 mg/kg of body weight for a single dose and no more than fiv e doses in a 24-hour period (Ji et al. , 2012). FDA appro val for intr avenous acetaminophen use in infants and children is also now a vailable (FDA, 2013). The maximum recommended dose of extended-release acetaminophen is 1300 mg every 8 hours. Acetaminophen extended-release, extr a-strength, and arthritis formulas are not recommended for children less than 12 y ears of age. In 2011 an FDA advisory panel announced that pediatric doses of acetaminophen should be labeled \"fev er reduction only\" in children under age 2. The panel found there w as too little evidence to label O TC acetaminophen for pain relief in infants under age 2, although doctors often prescribe the drug for this purpose. The advisory panel also re-emphasiz ed that prescribing acetaminophen for children should be based first on weight and then on age. The panel also advised the FDA to require that: Bottles of infant acetaminophen carry dosing instructions for ages 6 months to 2 y ears Bottles of liquid acetaminophen be changed to mak e it harder for kids to open and take an accidental o verdose Acetaminophen bottles to come with a liquid measuring device clearly mark ed in milliliters1000 mg.A. 2400 mg.B. 4000 mg.C. 6000 mg.D. Consider rehab before taking an y pain medications. A. Take no more than 2000 mg per da y. B. Take only NS AIDs for pain. C. Not tak e acetaminophen at all. D.The FDA announced that an additional less-concentr ated form of liquid acetaminophen marketed for \"infants\" (160 mg/5 mL) would be a vailable at local stores, packaged with an oral syringe r ather than a dropper . Until then, liquid acetaminophen mark eted for infants had only been a vailable in higher concentr ations (80 mg/0.8 mL or 80 mg/1 mL). This change in the concentr ation affects the amount of liquid giv en to an infant and should be especially noted if someone is accustomed to using the more concentr ated form (Drugs.com, 2018). The pharmacy industry also announced it would put flow restrictors on liquid acetaminophen bottles to prev ent unsupervised children from drinking large amounts of the medication. Companies will pro vide clearly mark ed syringes with all products for kids ages 3 and y ounger and will add clearly mark ed dosing cups to all products for kids ages 2 to 12. The maximum amount of acetaminophen in a prescription tablet, capsule, or other dosage unit will be limited to 325 mg. Howev er, the total number of tablets or capsules that ma y be prescribed and the time interv als at which they ma y be prescribed will not change as a result of the lower amount of acetaminophen. F or example, for a product that previously contained 500 mg of acetaminophen with an opioid and w as prescribed as 1 to 2 tablets every 4 to 6 hours, will now contain 325 mg of acetaminophen and the dosing instructions can remain unchanged (FDA, 2017). It is also advised that if a patient tak es the maximum dosage of acetaminophen allowed for two weeks, and the problem isn' t resolv ed, it is time to review with the ph ysician the cause and better treatment for the pain. Higher doses such as 500 mg/tablet ha ve also not show to deliv er better pain reduction than 325 mg/tablets. Unfortunately , for non-prescription products, the \"extr a-strength\" label that deliv ers 500 mg/tablet is still a vailable (Consumer Reports, 2014). Key Points Advise patients not to ex ceed the acetaminophen maximum total daily dose of 4 grams/da y. Severe liv er injury , including cases of acute liv er failure resulting in liv er transplant and death, has been reported with the use of acetaminophen. Educate patients about the importance of reading all prescription and O TC labels to ensure they are not taking multiple acetaminophen-containing products. Advise patients not to drink alcohol while taking acetaminophen-containing medications. Rare cases of anaph ylaxis and other h ypersensitivit y reactions ha ve occurred with the use of acetaminophen. Advise patients to seek medical help immediately if they ha ve taken more acetaminophen than directed or experience swelling of the face, mouth, and throat, difficult y breathing, itching, and r ash.

Acetaminophen Frequency of Use Acetaminophen is the most widely used analgesic medication in the United States despite its potential for hepatoto xicity. Over the past few y ears, the use of combination prescription products has increased dr amatically , and is the biggest cause of acetaminophen o verdose (Hodgman & Garr ard, 2012). It is estimated American consumers purchased more than 28 billion doses of products containing acetaminophen, of which: Single-ingredient O TC products (eg, T ylenol) Combination O TC products (eg, NyQuil, Ther aflu), represented more than 9.7 billion doses. Acetaminophen-containing prescription narcotics represented 11 billion doses. Almost 80,000 people in the United States are treated in Emergency Departments annually due to accidental o verdose of acetaminophen (Consumer R eports, 2014). Ov er 600 O TC and prescription medication products contain acetaminophen.In the last decade use of these combination prescription products increased 38%. There were more than 182 million prescriptions for combination prescription products and the most frequently used acetaminophen-containing prescription product is Vicodin (hydrocodone/acetaminophen combination). It has been the most frequently dispensed prescription drug since 1997 (FDA, 2011). The U .S. Centers for Disease Control estimate that more than 980 deaths occur each y ear due to acetaminophen-containing combination drugs and at least 300 people die as a direct result from acetaminophen-only poisoning (Miller , 2013). Since 2006 these death numbers represent more fatalities due to acetaminophen than all other O TC pain reliev ers and surpassed those who died from intentional o verdose to commit suicide.

Howev er, based on the prev alence of liv er injury , it appears that there are distinct factors associated with acetaminophen and acetaminophen products that contribute to this public health problem (Hodgman & Garrard, 2012). Consumers often do not know that taking more than the recommended dose of acetaminophen will not pro vide more relief and that they are in danger of liv er damage if they ex ceed the maximum recommended dose. Despite w arning labels, man y consumers are una ware that alcohol ma y exacerbate the risk of liv er damage. Also , they ma y not realiz e how much acetaminophen they are consuming if they tak e more than one product containing this drug. Because acetaminophen is found in so man y prescription and non- prescription products, taking more than the recommended dose is easy to do . People taking these medications ma y not ev en recogniz e that some of the drugs they are taking contain acetaminophen.Acetaminophen has a narrow safet y margin and taking just a small amount of the drug over the tr aditionally recommended total daily dose (4 gr ams per da y) ma y lead to liv er injury . The recommended doses and tablet strengths of acetaminophen lea ve little room for error, and the onset of liv er injury can be hard to recogniz e. There is scientific agreement that taking a large amount of acetaminophen o ver a short period of time causes liv er injury , but there are v arying views on the specific threshold for to xicity (Thomas, 2018). Some people ma y be especially prone to liv er injury from acetaminophen, and the maximum amount of acetaminophen that can be safely ingested ma y not be the same for everyone. Some individuals, especially children, elders, and those who use alcohol, ha ve liver disease, suffer from anorexia nerv osa, or are fasting, ma y have a greater susceptibilit y to the effects of the to xic metabolite produced b y the breakdown of acetaminophen because they produce more of the metabolite or because they are unable to clear it from the body as easily as a health y person. Individuals with increased susceptibilit y may experience to xic effects at lower acetaminophen doses than others and r are cases of acute liv er injury ha ve been link ed to amounts lower than 2.5 gr ams per da y. More research is needed to understand how ethnicit y, genetics, nutrition, or other factors pla y a role in making some individuals more prone to liv er injury (Hodgman & Garr ard, 2012; Thomas, 2018). Because there is such a wide arr ay of O TC and prescription acetaminophen products used in a range of doses for v arious indications, it can be difficult to identif y the appropriate product to use or how much of the drug is being ingested. Acetaminophen is an ingredient in man y widely used O TC single-ingredient products, such as those used to treat headaches, and multiple-ingredient (combination) products, such as those that treat symptoms of the common cold. As noted earlier , acetaminophen is also a component of a number of prescription drug products in combination with narcotic pain medicines. So , consumers ma y attempt to treat different conditions or symptoms with multiple choices among products containing acetaminophen, not realizing that acetaminophen is an ingredient common to each and that they are at risk of an o verdose (Consumer R eports, 2014). In addition, it can sometimes be difficult to identif y acetaminophen as an ingredient. Prescription products that contain acetaminophen (usually with codeine or o xycodone) are often labeled as containing \" APAP\" (N- acetyl-p-aminophenol), which is acetaminophen. Not knowing what AP AP is, patients ma y take more than one product containing acetaminophen. F or example, a prescription product and an O TC product ma y continue the same ingredients but be called different things and customers ma y unintentionally tak e a harmful o verdose.While many patients recognize that Tylenol contains acetaminophen, fewer know that Vicodin (hydrocodone/acetaminophen), Darvocet 2010) (propoxyphene/napsilate), and Percocet contain acetaminophen. Label for Combination Drug Vicodin Note: No warning about overdose of acetaminophen is evident on this Vicodin label. Image Source: Wikimedia Commons. Accidental overdoses can also occur in children because of the multiple products available that contain different strengths of acetaminophen. Liquid acetaminophen formulations intended for use in infants are typically more concentrated and therefore stronger, designed to enable dosing using less liquid. However, failure to distinguish between the two strengths of the liquid product can result in an overdose if a parent gives a higher dose of the concentrated infant drops to a young child (Budnitz et al., 2011).Toxic dose: 150 mg/kg (7 g in adult)STAGETime post ingestionClinical manifestations I 0-24 hours Anorexia, nausea, vomiting II 24-72 hours Right upper quadrant abdominal pain, AST/AL el evation III 72-96 hours Vomiting, renal failure, pancreatitis, worsening liver enzyme lab values IV > 5 days Multiple organ failure if not treated The association between acetaminophen and liv er injury is not common knowledge. Healthcare professionals are tr ained in basic pharmacokinetics and ha ve learned that all oral drugs must pass through the liv er to be metaboliz ed. Some medications are inherently hepatoto xic and, in o verdoses, man y drugs can become dangerous to the liv er cells. Consumers are not sufficiently a ware that acetaminophen can cause serious liv er injury , and their perceptions ma y be influenced b y the mark eting of the products. Because acetaminophen has been mark eted for decades, it is a familiar product that ma y be assumed to be completely safe. This perception ma y be reinforced b y the fact that the drug is widely a vailable O TC in v ery large quantities (ex, 500 tablets per bottle). Furthermore, adv ertisements of O TC products are not required to pro vide w arning information (FDA, 2013). If too much acetaminophen is consumed, it can often be difficult to recogniz e the onset of liver injury . The onset of symptoms associated with acetaminophen liv er injury can tak e several days, ev en in sev ere cases. In addition, symptoms ma y be non-specific and mimic flu symptoms, resulting in continued use of acetaminophen and further liv er damage.

Current labeling on O TC products ma y be o verlook ed or not understood, and many patients do not read the patient information pro vided with dispensed prescriptions. Progr ams to educate the public about safe use of acetaminophen ha ve been small and have encountered a number of obstacles. Advertisements of O TC drugs often emphasiz e the effectiv eness of products but, unlik e prescription drugs, are not required to offset such messages with w arning information. Many factors contribute to unintentional acetaminophen o verdose: The recommended daily doses and tablet strengths lea ve little room for error . Some people ha ve a decreased abilit y to clear the to xic metabolite created b y the breakdown of acetaminophen. There are man y medicines containing acetaminophen in a wide r ange of products and doses that mak e it difficult to know how much is being consumed. It is sometimes difficult to identif y acetaminophen as an ingredient (eg, it is sometimes labeled as AP AP). The majorit y of consumers do not know the dangers of acetaminophen. The symptoms of acetaminophen to xicity and liv er damage ma y be difficult to recogniz e. (Wikipedia, 2018b). In children, these additional factors contribute to unintentional o verdoses: Administering the wrong pediatric acetaminophen formulation (eg, substituting the concentr ated infant drops for the less concentr ated children' s suspension) Administering the adult dose instead of the age- appropriate dose Incorrectly calculating the weight -appropriate dose of acetaminophen Using the wrong dosing device (eg, using a tablespoon instead of a teaspoon, or a dropper instead of a syringe) (T ylenol website, 2018). Online Resource Acetaminophen Dosage for Children under 2 (Video 3:35) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KA-Ih9Tnx3w Liver Injury with Acet aminophen Use Research has shown that acetaminophen is a major cause of acute liv er failure in the United States. T aking more than the recommended amount of acetaminophen can cause liver damage r anging from abnormalities in liv er function blood tests to liv er failure and even death. There are an estimated 400 deaths each y ear from acetaminophen-caused liver failure (Hodgman & Garr ard, 2012). Acute liv er failure (ALF) due to acetaminophen o verdose: Accounts for appro ximately 50% of all cases of ALF Causes sev eral hundred deaths in the United States annually Is the most common form of ALF in the W estern world Is gener ally unintentional r ather than suicidal Outweighs all other drugs combined (Lee & Larson, 2009) Acetaminophen dosage for childr en under 2 Acetaminophen dosage for childr en under 2Answer: BTest Your Knowledge Incidence of acute liv er failure (ALF) due to acetaminophen o verdose: Acetaminophen to xicity is the most common etiology for accidental o verdose of O TC medications. P atients in these studies were found to ha ve taken too much acetaminophen from O TC, prescription products, or both. Almost half of these cases involved an o verdose in which the patient had not intended to tak e too much acetaminophen (unintentional overdoses), although man y cases of liv er injury with acetaminophen result from intentional self-poisoning (Budnitz et al. , 2011). Liver Injury, Population Overall Summarizing data related to acetaminophen- associated o verdoses from 2016, there were an estimated: 78,000 emergency department visits per y ear 33,000 hospitalizations per y ear Acetaminophen o verdose and hepatoto xicity is the leading cause of ALF in the United States. Source: Mosbergen, 2017. The liv er helps break down and remo ve man y chemicals or drugs that enter the body; howev er, taking too much acetaminophen o verloads the liv er's abilit y to process the drug effectiv ely (Jaeschk e et al. , 2012). The mechanism of liv er injury is not related to acetaminophen itself , but to the con version of small amounts of acetaminophen into a to xic metabolite called (NAPQI) cases. A. Outweighs all other drugs combined.B. Is negligible despite ongoing concerns.C. Gener ally results from intentional o verdose. D.When acetaminophen is tak en in ther apeutic doses, this metabolite is safely brok en down by the liv er and then ex creted in the urine; howev er, when liv er function is impaired (eg, in alcoholics), or if an ex cessiv e amount of acetaminophen is ingested, high concentr ations of NAPQI accumulate and bind with liv er proteins, causing cellular injury (McGill et al. , 2012). The amount of to xic metabolite produced and the abilit y of the liv er to remo ve this metabolite before it binds to liv er protein influence the extent of liv er injury (Hodgman & Garrard, 2012). The following ma y also lower the threshold for acetaminophen-caused hepatoto xicity: (INH, Ny drazid, Laniazid) The fasting state, poor nutrition, and/or anorexia nerv osa Signs and Symptoms An overdose of acetaminophen can seriously damage the liv er. The antidote to acetaminophen o verdose, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), is most effectiv e when giv en within 8 hours of ingesting acetaminophen and can prev ent liv er failure, if giv en early enough, b y replenishing the stores of glutathione in the liv er to deto xify NAPQI. F or this reason, it is absolutely necessary that acetaminophen poisoning be recogniz ed, diagnosed, and treated as early as possible (Budnitz et al. , 2011). Commercial products (eg, acetdote) are now available as the antidote. Unfortunately , the signs and symptoms of liv er damage ma y not be immediately apparent because they tak e time to appear , even in sev ere cases. The early symptoms of liv er damage such as loss of appetite, nausea, and v omiting, ma y be mistak en for the flu, or for the very issue that caused the symptoms they are trying to treat with acetaminophen (Hodgman & Garr ard, 2012). Answer: DTest Your Knowledge The early symptoms of liv er damage: Apply Your Knowledge Q: What are the symptoms of liv er toxicity? What expected lab tests should be done and what would y ou expect to see with hepatoto xicity? A: Signs of liv er disease include abnormally y ellow skin and ey es, dark urine, light - colored stools, nausea, v omiting, and loss of appetite. Serious cases of liv er disease ma y lead to mental confusion, and liv er damage can dev elop into liv er failure, coma, and death o ver sev eral days. Treatment An acetaminophen poisoning diagnosis can be determined b y measuring its lev el in the blood. Plasma lev els in an o verdose of acetaminophen peak about four hours after ingestion. Acetaminophen lev els are therefore usually ordered four hours from the time of suspected ingestion, although treatment is begun immediately . The R umack -Matthew nomogr am (see figure below), first dev eloped in 1976 at the R ocky Mountain P oison Center at Den ver and since modified to indicate treatment at a lower threshold, estimates the risk of liv er toxicity and injury based on acetaminophen lev els in the blood within 4 hours of the known time since ingestion (R umack et al. , 2017). The lev el is best determined after at least 4 hours so that an y drug ingested has had a chance to be absorbed b y the GI tr act. This does not mean that protectiv e measures should not be tak en prior to 4 hours. A second measurement can confirm the concentr ation and o verdose diagnosis with time.Include extreme fatigue.A. Are easily detected in sev ere cases. B. Show early as mark edly red ey es. C. Includes nausea and v omiting. D.Protectiv e measures ma y include stomach la vage to remo ve any unabsorbed tablets, then orally administered activ ated charcoal to absorb an y drug remaining in the stomach. This is followed b y administr ation of NAC, either or ally or intr avenously , to sta y clear of the stomach procedures. Since charcoal will absorb NAC, another stomach la vage ma y be done prior to or al administr ation to remo ve the Acetaminophen Overdose Image Source: Rumack et al., 1981. Clinical or biochemical evidence of liv er toxicity may dev elop in 1 to 4 da ys, although it may appear in 12 hours for sev ere cases. Labor atory studies ma y show evidence of hepatic necrosis with elev ated A ST, ALT, bilirubin, coagulation elevated prothrombin time (Wikipedia, 2018b). If the acetaminophen plasma lev els are high, the patient ma y need to be giv en subsequent maintenance doses of NAC. If giv en by IV, the loading dose is 150 mg/kg of body weight in 15 to 30 minutes; the maintenance doses are 50 mg/kg of body weight for 4 hours, and 100 mg/kg ev ery 4 hours for the following 16 hours, with the final dose of 10 mg/kg to be repeated three times until the liv er enzyme lab lev els ha ve normaliz ed (Mahmoudi, 2014).Anytime an o verdose of an y medication occurs in a hospital setting, an incident report is needed to ev aluate the cause and possible prev ention str ategies. In addition to the clerical responsibilities of drug o verdose, the emotional effects can be dev astating due to guilt, especially when innocent children are in volved. Patient and caregiv er education is essential to help identif y the causativ e factors, which ma y lead to prev ention guidelines and correctiv e instruction. As alw ays, an ounce of prev ention in education, is better than a pound of cure, especially when it comes to accidental drug o verdose.

D.The Safe Use of Acet aminophen The FDA giv es the following advice to consumers on the safe use of acetaminophen: You can safely giv e acetaminophen to infants, children, and teenagers if y ou check the active ingredients in the other medicines that y our child is taking (or that y our child ma y take) to mak e sure they don' t contain acetaminophen. Y our child should nev er be taking more than one medicine containing acetaminophen at a time. Answer: BTest Your Knowledge Concerning acetaminophen, a child should be giv en: The FDA recommends that parents :Read all the information giv en to y ou by your doctor . Read the information on the OTC \"Drug F acts\" label or on the prescription label and follow the directions.1. Be sure y ou understand the following: The dose, which is how much acetaminophen y ou can tak e at one time How man y hours y ou must w ait before taking another dose of acetaminophen How man y doses of acetaminophen y ou can tak e safely each da y When to stop taking acetaminophen and ask a doctor for help2. Never tak e more than directed, ev en if y our pain or fev er isn' t any better . Taking more acetaminophen than directed can put y ou at risk for liv er damage.3. Never tak e more than one medicine that contains acetaminophen. Check the active ingredients of all your medicines to mak e sure y ou are taking no more than one medicine containing acetaminophen at a time.4. An increased dose if the previous does w as ineffectiv e. A. Only one medication containing acetaminophen at a time.B. A dose determined solely b y the age of the child. C. A little extr a to mak e up for a missed dose. D. Read all the information giv en by your child' s doctor and read the information on the O TC \"Drug F acts\" label or on the prescription label and follow directions.1.If too much acetaminophen is ingested, or if too much is giv en to a child, do not w ait. Call 911 or P oison Control (1 800 222 1222) right a way to find out what to do . The national poison control center phone number is a vailable 24 hours a da y, 7 da ys a week, and 35 days a y ear. The signs or symptoms of liv er damage ma y not be noticeable for hours or ev en da ys after taking acetaminophen. By the time y ou notice changes, the liv er damage ma y be sev ere and could lead to death. Use of Acetaminophen in Elders and ChildrenChoose the right medicine based on your child's weight and age . If a dose for your child's weight or age is not listed on the label, or y ou cannot tell how much to giv e, ask y our pharmacist or doctor what to do . On O TC medicines, the directions section of the \"Drug F acts\" label tells y ou: If the medicine is right for y our child How much medicine to giv e How man y hours y ou must w ait before giving another dose When to stop giving acetaminophen and ask a doctor for help2. Use the measuring tool that comes with the medicine. It will giv e the exact dose. If y ou do not ha ve the right measuring tool, ask a pharmacist. Do not use a spoon that is meant to be used for cooking or eating. A spoon should not be used to measure medicine because it ma y give the wrong amount.3. Never giv e more than one medicine that contains acetaminophen. If y ou giv e more, it could harm y our child.4. In order to prev ent medicine accidents: Keep a record of the medicines y ou giv e your child. W rite down the dose and time when y ou giv e the medicine. This will help ev eryone who cares for your child know how much medicine y our child has had and prev ent the accidental administr ation of an extr a dose. Keep medicine where it cannot be seen or reached b y children and pets; a locked bo x, cabinet, or closet is best.5. If the pain or fev er do not impro ve, talk to y our doctor , nurse or pharmacist. Give the medicine only as directed and no more.6.Older adults, children, those who regularly consume alcohol, and people who tak e certain medications are at increased risk of o verdose from acetaminophen. Older Adults Older adults are the largest users of prescription medications, y et with adv ancing age they are more vulner able to adv erse reactions to the medications they are taking, as well as to dosing errors. About 30% of hospital admissions of older adults are drug-related. In addition, after the age of 75, older adults ha ve decreased comprehension of medication instructions (F arrell et al. , 2018). Poor vision is also a problem more common with age. One study showed that almost one- half of the older patients stated that they were not able to read the labels on the bottles due to poor ey esight, inabilit y to read English, or small writing on the bottles. Poor cognition ma y lead to inabilit y to follow medication regimens. The most common t ype of noncompliance is dose omission, but o ver-consumption is also a common mistak e in older people. Older adults ha ve narrow ther apeutic windows (due to decreased metabolism and liv er drug clear ance lev els), and require close monitoring, especially when on multiple medications and with potentially compromised liv er and kidney function. A review of ED visits of patients 65 y ears and older found that more than 10% of the visits were related to an adv erse drug ev ent and more than 30% had at least one potential adv erse drug interaction in their medication regimen (F arrellet al. , 2018). The American Geriatrics Societ y (2009) states that the maximum 24-hour dose of acetaminophen in most older persons is 4 g and the 24-hour maximum in older patients with hepatic insufficiency or a history of alcohol abuse is 50% to 75% of the usual, or 2 to 3 grams. Answer: BTest Your Knowledge Older adults using acetaminophen need special attention because: Online Resource An NP's Role in Supporting Appropriate NSAID and Acetaminophen Dosages (Video 4:55) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zEERwncVWY Children Acetaminophen is a common treatment for pain and fev er in children and is a vailable O TC primarily in liquid form. P arents need to use caution when administering liquid acetaminophen. Acetaminophen comes in two strengths, a suspension to be used for older children and infants, and a more concentr ated infant drop formula that is 3 times stronger than the children' s suspension. The different concentr ations can lead to serious errors in dosing (Br ass, 2018). The manufacturers include a measuring device, properly calibr ated and clearly mark ed for product dosing in each package, making it easier for caregiv ers to giv e the appropriate dose. P arents are cautioned against giving an y acetaminophen or cough and cold medications to children under 2 y ears of age without the advice of a healthcare pro vider (Brass, 2018; Buck, 2011). An NP' s Role in Suppor ting Appr opriate ting Appr opriate NSAI ......They came of age during a time of widespread recreational drug use.A. Poor vision or cognition ma y cause inabilit y to follow medication regimens. B. They are not accustomed to o ver-the-counter medications. C. Dosages need to be higher because of common aches and pains.D.Prescription dosing errors are also common in children, and their smaller siz e mak es them more vulner able to these errors and less able to communicate signs and symptoms that indicate a problem. Acetaminophen Dosage for Infants and Children Another concentr ation (160 mg/5 mL) of liquid acetaminophen mark eted for \"infants\" is now a vailable in stores. This product is less concentr ated than other liquid acetaminophen products mark eted for children. The other products currently a vailable are in 80 mg/0.8 mL and 80 mg/1 ations. The 160 mg/5 mL acetaminophen mark eted for infants ma y be packaged with an or al syringe instead of a dropper . It is important to use only the dosing device pro vided with the product. Do not mix and match dosing devices . The concentr ation of liquid acetaminophen should be included on a prescription because multiple products with different concentr ations are a vailable. Healthcare professionals should use their clinical judgment to recommend the most appropriate liquid acetaminophen product for children under the age of 12, and they should counsel caregiv ers on product differences. Healthcare professionals should report adv erse ev ents or medication errors in volving products to the FDA MedW atch progr am. Source: Brass, 2018. Online Resource Children and Acetaminophen (Video 1:58) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDfgpMri0Y8 Alcohol and Acetaminophen It has been known for many years that there is an increased danger of liver damage in people who regularly drink alcohol and take acetaminophen, even at recommended doses. Acetaminophen and alcohol are both metabolized by the liver, and ethanol, isoniazid for tuberculosis, and St. John's wort all induce higher levels of the CYP2E1 enzyme that generates the toxic NAPQI metabolite and depletes the glutathione antioxidant needed to clear it. The increased amount of the toxic metabolite NAPQI produced may cause liver cell stress or death (Hodgman & Garrard, 2012). Many of the drug interactions listed below result from shared metabolism and competition for the same liver enzymes, or an induced or reduced level of enzyme that exacerbates safe co-administration. Drug Interactions Warfarin (Coumadin) is a drug that is often used to prevent blood clots after heart valve replacement and for a type of abnormal heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation. A warning has been issued by the FDA about a possible interaction between warfarin and acetaminophen that may increase the risk of bleeding. Children and AcetaminophenChildren and AcetaminophenHealthcare professionals need to consider this as a possible cause of an increase in their International Normaliz ed Ratio (INR) for patients taking w arfarin. The INR is used to measure the clotting tendencies of the blood. The w arning label reads as follows: \" Ask a doctor or pharmacist before use if y ou are taking the blood thinning drug w arfarin. \" This warning is required on all O TC acetaminophen products ex cept those also containing NSAIDS, which ha ve their own stomach bleeding w arning (Hughes et al. , 2011). The risk of increased bleeding is greater with higher doses of acetaminophen. The bleeding risk has been found to increase tenfold in people who were taking 28 or more regular - strength acetaminophen tablets per week, or the equiv alent of 18 or more extr a-strength tablets per week, compared to those taking w arfarin and no acetaminophen (Hughes et al. , 2011). As alluded to earlier , there ha ve been a number of reports of liv er damage in volving a possible drug inter action between isoniazid, a medication used to prev ent and treat tuberculosis, and acetaminophen. Isoniazid alone, especially as people get older , has been documented to cause liv er damage. The combination of acetaminophen with isoniazid ma y increase this danger (NIH, 2013). Did You Know . . . The FDA advises people who are taking isoniazid for tuberculosis or who ha ve a positiv e TB skin test and are using this drug, to consult with their ph ysician before using acetaminophen or an y combination product containing acetaminophen. They are advised to discuss alternativ es to acetaminophen with their ph ysician (Medicine Net, 2018). People who tak e anti-seizure medications lik e phen ytoin (Dilantin), phenobarbital, or carbamaz (T egretol) should consult a doctor before taking acetaminophen. These drugs can cause an increase in NAPQI formation from acetaminophen and can therefore increase liv er damage (Medicine Net, 2018). Answer: ATest Your Knowledge People who tak e warfarin to prev ent blood clots: Apply Your Knowledge What patient education is needed for patients who are taking Coumadin or isoniazid for OTC pain relief ? What symptoms would y ou teach them to be a ware of ? FDA R ulings on Acet aminophen Labeling OTC Labeling In 2009 the FDA issued a rule that strengthens the labeling for O TC products containing acetaminophen. The following bo x lists some of the labeling requirements, which includes more specific w arnings about liv er injury , the role of alcohol in increasing the risk of liv er injury , and the importance of a voiding the use of more than one product that contains acetaminophen (FDA, 2013). May be at risk for bleeding if they also tak e acetaminophen. A. Can also tak e acetaminophen so long as they don' t exceed the 24-hour maximum.B. Will benefit b y the addition of acetaminophen and ha ve even fewer blood clots.C. May offset the benefits of the w arfarin if they tak e acetaminophen. D.Labeling Requirements for OTC Products Containing Acetaminophen The alcohol warning is part of the liver warning (instead of the separate alcohol warning previously required). The warning includes information on the potential for severe liver damage associated with exceeding the maximum daily dose or taking three or more alcoholic drinks a day while taking acetaminophen. The liver warning is required on immediate container labels in addition to the carton or outer container. The ingredient name (acetaminophen) is highlighted or in bold type and in a prominent print size on the package's principal display panel (PDP) of the immediate container, and the outer carton (if applicable). This is intended to help consumers identify the active ingredient and reduce the number of people inadvertently exposed to multiple products containing acetaminophen.\"See new warnings information\" is highlighted or in bold type and in a prominent print size on the PDP. This statement must appear on the products PDP for one year after the final rule is published.The label must contain a warning not to use acetaminophen with any other drug containing acetaminophen and to ask a doctor or pharmacist if unsure. It must also include a direction to ask a doctor before taking acetaminophen in the presence of liver disease or if using the blood-thinning drug warfarin.The FDA will also expand its existing educational programs to reach both the general public and healthcare professionals in order to raise awareness about acetaminophen and liver injury and to encourage safe use practices. These educational programs will include: Take no more than the recommended dose of acetaminophen. Do not mix acetaminophen-containing products. Talk to your doctor about acetaminophen if you consume alcohol or have liver disease.

Complete spelling of activ e ingredients in acetaminophen-containing prescription medicines. Completely spell all activ e ingredients in acetaminophen-containing medicine on the prescription container label. No acron yms, abbreviations, or truncations for acetaminophen or an y other activ e ingredients should be used. When a br and or br anded generic medicine is dispensed, completely spell all activ e ingredients in addition to the br anded name.1. Acetaminophen concomitant use and liv er warning label Adopt one standard concomitant use and liv er warning label in alignment with the O TC acetaminophen w arnings on Drug F acts labels. This will make the messaging consistent and strengthen and reinforce the messaging for patients across all acetaminophen-containing medicines. Adopt a standard hier archy for the k ey messages on the w arning label for these labels. Delete all w arning labels containing similar k ey messages from w arning label data files to prevent duplication of k ey messages on prescription labels.2. Prioritization of w arning label printing Prioritiz e the standard w arning label to print within the top 3 w arning labels to increase the probabilit y the label will print and be applied to prescription containers.3. Icons on pharmacy w arning labels Icons can be used on w arning labels if testing has pro ven the icons impro ve consumer and patient understanding bey ond simple explicit text alone.4.The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has added all acetaminophen-containing products to its quarterly list of products to monitor because of possible signals of serious risks or new safety information. The agency receives reports of possible adverse events for these products in the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database annually. Making the watch list does not mean that the FDA has determined that the drug poses the specific health risk reported through FAERS. What it does mean is that the FDA will investigate whether there is a causal link. All products containing acetaminophen appear on the latest watch list because of reports of severe skin reactions. Dermatologic disorders are known adverse reactions associated with these analgesics. The FDA is not suggesting that clinicians should stop prescribing it or that patients should stop taking it, but rather to be aware of its high risk for adverse reactions (PEI, 2018).Manufacturers of acetaminophen-containing medicines, working through Consumer Healthcare Products Association (CHPA) and in collaboration with academia, are currently conducting research to explore the effectiveness of an acetaminophen-ingredient icon for cross-industry inclusion on both OTC (Drug Facts label) and prescription container labels. Patient-centered pharmacy warning labelsEmploy general health literacy and plain language principles on the warning label to promote patient readability and understanding. Patient-centered labels should reflect strategies (simple, clear language; font type and size) that promote optimal readability of critical information, consistent with recommendations by health literacy experts, plain language experts, and other organizations that have addressed patient-centered approaches to labeling in order to maximize readability and patient comprehension.5.Answer: DTest Your Knowledge The current FDA ruling on labeling acetaminophen included all but one of the following: Conclusio n Acetaminophen is one of the most commonly used drugs in the United States to reduce pain and fev er. But, despite its popularit y, efficacy , and gener al safet y when used according to dosing instructions, acetaminophen is the leading cause of acute liv er failure in this country . Although man y instances of liv er injury are the result of intentional o verdoses, almost half of these ev ents occur because patients unknowingly tak e too much of the drug. Acetaminophen has a narrow ther apeutic margin and there is little difference between the current maximum recommended dose of acetaminophen and the doses that are associated with an elev ated risk of hepatoto xicity. In particular , there has been a disproportionate increase in liv er injury in recent y ears as a result of misuse of acetaminophen-containing prescription medicines. Liv er abnormalities caused b y acetaminophen to xicity can r ange from abnormalities in liv er function blood tests to acute liv er failure and death. Due to numerous reports of accidental o verdose, the pharmacy industry' s voluntary responses to the FDA 's concerns ha ve provided significant impro vement to prescription container labels for acetaminophen-containing medicines. Howev er, continuing these efforts to implement the NCPDP recommendations needs to remain a priorit y for all stak eholders identified in the White P aper. Consistency across O TC and prescription container labels is a critical first step to enable consumers and patients to identif y and compare ingredients and tak e steps to impro ve their appropriate and safe use of acetaminophen.
