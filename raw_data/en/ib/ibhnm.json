One must be ready to make a change in their physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual lives by applying what they have learned during their ceremony, meaning that these plant medicines are to be taken seriously, with great intention, and not dosed recreationally. One must also be ready to completely surrender to the medicine and let it take them where they need to go; the plant spirit knows exactly what one most needs to see, feel, hear, experience, and thus, learn. Since the effects of the plant medicine are so powerful, they are oftentimes looked at by shamanic cultures as Spiritual beings. Many common shamanic plant medicines include, but are certainly not limited to: Ayahuasca, Iboga, San Pedro cactus, psychedelic mushrooms (though not exactly a plant), Salvia, and Peyote cactus. To give a brief overview and an example of what a plant medicine ceremony is, I will share with you about a currently popular one of these plant medicines, Ayahuasca. Ayahuasca Unlike any other sacred plant medicine, Ayahuasca is comprised of two separate plants: the chacruna leaf (Psychotria viridis) and the Ayahuasca vine (Banisteriopsis caapi). Alone, neither of these plants produce medicinal nor entheogenic properties. However, when combined, they work together and become a very powerful and sacred medicine. Both of these plants are found in the Amazon rainforest in South America. Astonishingly, in this particular rainforest, there are over 80,000 cataloged leafy plant species. Yet, somehow, the psychopharmacologists of the Amazon (the shamanic healers) knew exactly which two plant species would create such a magical and psychoactive medicine when combined. The history of Ayahuasca use dates so far back that anthropologists and researchers have yet been able to trace its origins; however, the shamans claim that the plants, themselves, told them during a Middle World shamanic journey. The plants are collected from the jungle and brewed into a sacred tea. The tea, when taken ceremonially, throws open the gates to the spirit realm and reveals mystical, non-ordinary worlds that are unperceivable in ordinary consciousness. Currently, the use of this brew has positively evolved to reach more and more people; now, any interested person can experience the extraordinary healing power of Ayahuasca. Unfortunately, many Western cultures have yet been able to fully understand the healing and medicinal properties of this unique plant substance. For that, it is illegal in many countries. Yet, it is not only legal but highly praised in it's birthplace: the Amazonian countries of Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Bolivia, and Brazil. In these countries, foreigners have the opportunity to partake in an Ayahuasca ceremony with a trained shaman. It is during these ceremonies that participants are able to face the root causes of their physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual illnesses head-on and delve deep into the healing process by allowing the spirit of Ayahuasca to take them on a journey to these realms of non-ordinary consciousness. Within these realms, deep-seeded issues that have long been hidden within one's subconscious mind are revealed to them. Mother Ayahuasca, as the plant spirit is often referred to (due to it's feminine and mother-like qualities), will always teach the participant precisely what they most need to learn in order to fully, truly heal themselves. An Ayahuasca Ceremony As specific traditions within Ayahuasca ceremonies will vary from shaman to shaman, these following customs generally remain the same: Preparation \u2014 Ayahuasca diet Ayahuasca is a total spirit, mind, and body cleanse; for that, a special diet (or dieta, as it is commonly referred to in South America), is required. Usually, during the first half of a ceremony, there is a fair amount of purging; from either or both ends. This is because Ayahuasca is purifying the physical body of heavy energy before it moves on to mental, emotional, and spiritual body purification. A great way to lessen, or, in some cases, completely avoid, the purging process is to begin the purification process the week before the ceremony. Specific dietas vary, but usually require one to abstain from sex, drugs, alcohol, pork, coffee, and chocolate. In some cases, dietas even require the absence of salt, meat, spice, and sugar. If the diet is followed properly, one is sure to reap the benefits soon after the tea is ingested. Plus, it is considered respectful to follow a dieta prior to sitting in Ayahuasca Ceremony. The Ceremony Each shaman has their own personal way of setting up the ceremonial area. However, ceremonies are typically held just after sunset in a safe, relaxing, and comfortable environment, most notably within high energy places on the land. Authentic and safe ceremonies, are small groups of participants, 2 to 7, and one shaman and their apprentices sit with you during a ceremony, all of whom ingest the brew. The shaman creates a very open and safe space by setting up an altar, and playing soothing music. He or she will also clear and protect the energy of the space by filling the room of, and blowing onto the crown of each participant, a form of sacred tobacco called \"Mapacho\". Then, the shaman suggests that each person set an intention for their journey, whether that be to heal past wounds or to learn self-love. The group then prays together and gives thanks to Mother Ayahuasca. Finally, one by one, each participant drinks the brew and begins to journey. . . Once the medicine kicks in, the shaman will begin to sing icaros, or healing songs, which help to intensify the medicine and further protect the energy of the room. The Return Ayahuasca typically lasts around 5 hours. As everyone in the ceremony begins to return to normal, conscious reality, the shaman will again use Mapacho to clear the energy of the space and ground each individual. The floor will then be open for sharing and heartfelt communion. Afterward, each participant can personally discuss their experience with the shaman, who will then help to integrate their experience to this physical reality and provide advice on how to incorporate their newly discovered wisdom into their lives for optimal healing.
