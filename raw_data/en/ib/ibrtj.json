Ministry of Science & Technology brings interventions to make healthcare accessible and affordable like low cost vaccines for disease prevention, diagnostic kits for detection and medicines for treatment of diseases. In addition to health care interventions, the Ministry also focuses on the health care delivery system with the growing engagement of the private sector, specially startups and small industry. The availability of a proper technology translational mechanism ensures this. India is a Leader in vaccine development & manufacture DBT's Indo-US Vaccine Action Programme (VAP) & the Vaccine Grand Challenge Programme (VGCP) helped develop the world's lowest cost rotavirus vaccine. The vaccine developed from Indian strain 116E is efficacious in preventing severe rotavirus diarrhea in low-resource settings in India. Introduced in 9 has received WHO prequalification in 2018 and has been included in India's Universal Immunization Program (UIP). Furthermore, the program is taking major strides towards vaccine for diseases like dengue, enteric diseases, influenza, malaria & tuberculosis (TB). It is estimated that one out of every six children over the world receives vaccines manufactured in India. Malaria Vaccine: International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (ICGEB), New Delhi along with its translational research partner \"Multi Vaccines Development Program\" has made significant progress in the development of vaccines for P. falciparum and P. vivax malaria. Funding support through Vaccine Grand Challenge Program of Department of Biotechnology, Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council (BIRAC) and multiple international agencies including Malaria Vaccine Initiative (MVI), PATH and European Vaccine Initiative (EVI) has made this possible. . Dengue Vaccine: The International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (ICGEB) in collaboration with drug major Sun Pharma is using the recombinant EDIII-based sub-unit dengue vaccine candidate to develop an injectable vaccine that protects against all four dengue strains that are endemic to India. Low cost diagnostic kits help timely detection of diseases 1- Day Dengue Diagnostic Kit The highly sensitive rapid 1- day dengue diagnostic kit detects Dengue Virus (DENV) infection from the first day of fever, with a cost of Rs 145/test to the distributors. The kit's performance was tested by Drug Controller Govt. of India and is currently being exported. Diagnostic kits for Celiac disease The Celiac diagnostic kits (Celiac Microlisa & Celiac Card) were developed through collaborative, multi-institutional, inter-disciplinary efforts and are rapid, sensitive, specific, and are much cheaper in comparison to imported kits in use today. The participating institutions were ICGEB, New Delhi, Translational Health Science and Technology Institute (THSTI), Gurugram; All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, and have been made commercially available by industrial partner J. Mitra and Co. Pvt. Ltd. Plasma Gelsolin Diagnostic Kit for prematurity and sepsis CSIR-IMTECH has developed two mass-production ready, plate-based kits to estimate plasma gelsolin levels in humans leading to early detection of pre-term birth. After successful clinical trials, the diagnostic kit has been transferred to an industry for commercialization. eSkIN: An in-silico Platform for Skin Data Analysis A sophisticated but user-friendly software tool named \"eSkIN\" has been developed for skin system which enables modeling, simulations, analysis, and visualization.

Novel processes for Eribulin, Nicotine and Bedaquiline Serving as important drugs for health care, bench scale processes have been developed for all three molecules, for which synthesis at a large scale is necessary to serve the market demand. In all three cases, the developed routes are new and cost-effective. Eribulin (an anti-cancer drug) fragments are now made in lesser number of steps, Nicotine is made in one-step and Bedaquiline (anti-Drug Resistant TB drug) synthesis was achieved from commercially available starting materials at a low cost. Anti-diabetes herbal drug CSIR has developed an anti-diabetic herbal formulation from a combination of natural extracts derived from six plant species mentioned in ancient Ayurveda texts. The drug, BGR-34, was approved by the Ministry of Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy (AYUSH) after it was tested on patients over a period of 18 months across states of Delhi, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab specifically ventricular fibrillation (VF) and non-perfusing ventricular tachycardia (VT). A defibrillator delivers a dose of electric current (often called a countershock) to the heart. The world's first electricity and hand-cranked dual powered defibrillator has been developed, serving in regions without reliable electricity such as in India, Africa, South America and Asia. Health units such as Primary Health Centres (PHCs) and Community Health Centres (CHCs) as well as emergency response units of security forces would benefit from this immensely. The price of this device would be 1/4th of the big brands, while providing similar or higher quality and reliability levels. "}
