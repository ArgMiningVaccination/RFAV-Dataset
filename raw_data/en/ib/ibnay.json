Please talk to yo ur referring provider about securing a referral or an authorization for you visit. If a referral or an authorization is not obtained prior to your visit, you will be considered a self-pay patient and the fees described below will apply to the services you receive. If you are a self-pay patient, meaning you do not have insurance or you are choosing not to use your insurance, a deposit of $345 will be collected from you when you check in to see the doctor for your first visit. This fee only covers your exam and conversation with the physician. If the physician performs any test s or does any procedures, you will be billed for those additional services. The deposit fee fo r future follow-up visits will be $160.00. You will receive a bill for the balance of the charges based on the services provided during your office visit. UCSF automatically provides a 40% discount to all self pay patients. If you are coming here for a seco nd opinion, it is very comm on for the physician to request that any pertinent previous pathology slides and radiology films be reviewed here at UCSF. If your doctor suggests this as their plan, please be aware that charges for these evaluations can range from $400 to $2500 . If you want an estima te prior to either the Department of Pathology or t he Department of Radiology per forming their review, please call (415) 353-1269 or (415) 353-1609 for Pat hology and (415) 353-1236 for Radiology. You may be asked to make a dep osit for these reviews in adva nce. Unfortunately, our staff at the Cancer Center do not have access to how the pricing is determined by these other departments and is unable to provi de you with an accurate quote. Many patients have insurance plans with d eductibles. If your insurance plan has a deductible, UCSF will first bill your i nsurance plan and if you have not met your deductible, you will receive a bill for your medical services. The bill you receive will be at a reduced rate based on the allowable charge s as defined by your insur ance contract with UCSF. If at any time you would like to speak to a financial counselor to see if any special arrangements can be made, please fax (415) 885-3505 or call (415) 885-7803. Sincerely, Cancer Center Staff 1 of 2 rev. 12.08 Radiology Information Sheet for Patients What is the difference between the radi ology report and the radiology films? A report will cover the findings of the radiologist at the t ime your scan is taken. The films are the scan itself. When you come in fo r a new patient appointment, your doctor will usually want to see both the report and films. What kind of format will the scans have? Scans have traditionally been on oversized black translucent films but increasingly scans are being put on comp act disks (CD ROM). Isn't the radiologist's report enough? Why is m y doctor requesting the films? The physician will often review the radiologist's repor t as a starting place to plan your treatment. However, because you are being referred to our physicians who collaborate with the UCSF Radiology Depar tment in planning your treatment, he or she will always request the radiology films be sent. The films are used to confirm t he diagnosis and plan treatment. How do I obtain the films? You call the hospital or facility where you had the sca n done. If you call a hospital, you will need to ask to be connected to the R adiology Department. Attached to this information sheet are numbers to many regional hospitals. UCSF prefers scans to be on CD ROMS but you need to ask the department to put the CD's into Di-Com format. The Radiology Department will often r equest that you sign a release fo r the films. Here is the link to the UCSF release form: http://www.ucsfhealth.org/adult/patient_ guide/services/health _info_release_form.p df This release can also be used for you to obtai n your medical records or tissue slides. What if I want a copy of my films? If you would like a copy of y our films, and your facility puts them on CD ROM, you must request two copies : one for you to keep and one to send to our Center. To protect your privacy, we destroy all CD ROMs after downloading into our Radi ology system and are unable to return these to you. Co pies of the large translucent films can be kept for you to pick up after your provider has completed reviewing them although sometimes they wish to keep them for further review sometime s several weeks or longer. Original large translucent films will be s ent back to the facility. What happens if the films are lost? If a film were to get lost you can usually request a new copy from the facility where you had the scan done. However, you should always co nfirm with that facilit y that you are not taking the only remaining copy. 2 of 2 rev. 12.08 If I send scans to UCSF will there be additional fee s? When UCSF Radiology Department reviews the f ilms for a second opinion t hey charge a fee. Typically, most insurance plans w ill cover this and our staff will seek an authorization. What scans should I request? Any scans related to the disease process for which you are being referred to us. These include: Bone Scan; Tomography (PET); and Standard X-rays such as chest x-rays. Please note that Ultrasounds ma y only be provided by report, there are no ultrasound films. Do I need to provide Radiology Film s for future follow up appointments? Yes, if you continue to receive care at UCSF and you do not have your Radiology tests done at UCSF, you will need t o send all Radiol ogy films placed on a CD ROM reports done in-between your visits to the address above.
