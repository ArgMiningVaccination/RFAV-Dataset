Detoxification or Detox is the removal of toxins from a living organism. Every word we speak, action we take or thought we have, brings with it either positive or negative energy into our lives. Any toxic behaviour, attitude, or negative influence you allow into your life may be secretly poisoning your soul. When it comes to spiritual detoxification, your diet consists of all you consume physically, emotionally, mentally and spiritually. Your physical body, energy level and state of mind can help determine whether or not you need a spiritual detox. If you feel disconnected and generally switched off, your energy levels may be low, and you'll need a way to counter this. A spiritual detox can help cleanse your mind, body and spirit, which will also benefit your physical and emotional wellbeing. Spiritual detoxing raises your energy vibrations, vital forces and aligns you to your true self. Here are a few signs to help you determine whether or not you need a spiritual detox: You... - find yourself scrolling through your newsfeed seeking negativity. - keep finding yourself in circumstances where you feel like the victim. - can't even remember the last time you took a walk, watched the sunset or sunrise, walked barefoot in the grass, or felt the summer breeze on your face. - have become numb, emotionless and live in denial - are suffering from insomnia and keep having bad dreams - live with regrets, guilt or are burdened with resentment. There are many different spiritual detoxification practices, which can help you achieve a state of happiness, calm, and inner peace. To clear out a calm inner space, you need first to get rid of the negative setbacks such as addictions, unhealthy behaviour, unhappiness, guilt, judgement, arrogance, fear and other negative emotions and patterns. Here are some of the best practices to help you do just that: Sound healing According to sound healing practitioners, the body's cells are harmonised through vibration from sound, which promotes healing. Sound baths use repetitive notes at different frequencies to help bring your focus away from your thoughts. There are different types of sound healing, including music and sound therapy, binaural beats, mantra and chanting, tuning forks, and sound baths with singing bowls or gongs. You can experience sound healing today via the meditation section on the DeepH App. It has been specially designed and created by shamans and spiritual masters from around the world. Breathwork Techniques You can do many different breathing practices, and you should try different ones to see which you prefer. Here are some of the most popular. Holotropic Breathing is a powerful approach to self-exploration and personal empowerment that relies on our innate inner wisdom and its capacity to move us towards positive transformation and wholeness. The holotropic breathing method is straightforward, combining accelerated breathing with evocative music in a unique set and setting. Rebirthing Breathwork is a safe and natural breathing method based on simplicity. It is designed to connect you to your subconscious mind, where you house your deepest thoughts, beliefs and desires. It uses an easy to follow breathing technique called conscious connected circular breathing guided by a trained Breathwork facilitator. During the session, a safe space is created to dive deep within yourself. Here you can unlock your energetic potential and activate your life force energy, making you feel vibrant, peaceful and alive. Plant Medicine Ayahuasca is an Amazonian plant medicine that has been used for hundreds, possibly thousands, of years. It is used by the indigenous ayahuasca shamans across the upper Amazonian region that spreads across Peru, Colombia, Ecuador and Brazil. The word ayahuasca translates to vine of death or vine of souls. This powerful tea induces intense hallucinations and allows deep introspection. The entire ayahuasca experience lasts for approximately 8 hours, with the most potent effects lasting 1-3 hours. Meditation Meditation is an accessible practise that everyone can try at any point in their lives. Meditation will help you to observe the world around you from a distance. Gradually, as you notice yourself observing rather than reacting to stressful situations or fears, you'll see the real impact mediation can have on your life. When we meditate, we inject far-reaching and long-lasting benefits into our lives: we lower our stress levels, we get to know our pain, we connect better, we improve our focus, and we're kinder to ourselves.
