The provisions of this paragraph shall not be constr ued to limit the use of Teachers' Retirement System credit pursuant to KRS 61.680(2)(a). (3) The retirement allowance shall be calculated by using the member's known creditable compensation prior to his last month's employment and an estimate of his creditable compensation during the last month he was employed. Based upon this calculation, the State Treasurer shall be requested to issue the initial retirement payment. (4) A new calculation shall be made when the official report has been received of the me mber's creditable compensation during his last month's employment.

The intent of the General Assembly is to add to and coordinate, and not replace, existing efforts and responsibilities in the areas of hazardous waste management, toxic chemical manufacture, processing, or other use, and to leave the primary burden and responsibility for hazardous waste and toxic chemical reduction on private indust ry; and further to finance assistance and coordination by imposing assessments on the generation of hazardous waste. The assessments are intended to produce a reduction in waste generated; to promote the use of new techniques in recycling, treatment, and alternatives other than land disposal; and to place the burden of financing additional hazardous waste management activities necessarily undertaken by state agencies on the users of those products associated with the generation of hazardous waste. The Gener al Assembly further finds that Kentucky's industries need assistance in developing and implementing pollution prevention goals and that a fund should be established to provide technical and financial assistance to those industries.

The provisions of KRS 45A.695 to 45A.725 may be suspended by the cabinet if necessary t o respond to an environmental emergency. (b) Provide for post -closure monitoring and maintenance of hazardous waste disposal sites upon termination of post -closure monitoring and maintenance responsibilities by persons permitted to operate the facility pursuant to this chapter. (c) Identify, investigate, classify, contain, or clean up any release, threatened release, or disposal of a hazardous substance where responsible parties are economically or otherwise unavailable to properly address the problem and the problem represents an imminent danger to the health of the citizens and the environment of the Commonwealth. (4) The cabinet shall have the authority to finance the nonfederal share of the cost for clean up of sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96 -510). 160 ACTS OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY (5) The cabinet shall recover, when possible, actual and necessary expenditures incurred in carrying out the duties under this section. Any expenditures recovered shall be placed in th e hazardous waste management fund. (6) It is the expressed purpose of this section to accomplish effective hazardous waste and toxic chemical management that results in a reduction of the generation of hazardous wastes and the release of toxic chemicals within the Commonwealth; further, it is a purpose of this chapter to allocate a portion of the cost of administering necessary governmental programs related to hazardous waste and toxic chemical management to those industries whose products are reasonably r elated to the generation of hazardous waste. (7) There is hereby imposed upon every person engaged within this state in the generation of hazardous waste an annual hazardous waste assessment to be determined pursuant to this section according to the quantity by weight of hazardous waste generated, except that no assessment shall be levied against generators for any quantity of \"special wastes,\" waste oil, or spent material from air pollution control devices controlling emissions from coke manufacturing fac ilities. The assessment shall not be imposed upon any person for any quantities of hazardous waste generated by others for which that person is a secondary handler that stores, processes, or reclaims the waste.

Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky: SECTION 1. KRS CHAPTER 349 IS ESTABLISHED AND A NEW SECTION THEREOF IS CREATED TO READ AS FOLLOWS: (1) The General Assembly hereby declares: (a) The venting of coalbed methane and degasification of coal seams is approved by the Commonwealth for the purpose of ensuring the safe recovery of coal; (b) The positive economic impact of coal mining to the Commonwealth is currently greater than that of coalbed methane production; (c) Coalbed methane is not found in conventional gas reservoirs; (d) Any development of coalbed methane should be undertaken in a way to protect and preserve the environment and protect and preserve the coal for future safe mining and the maximum recovery of coal; (e) Commercial recovery and marketing of coalbed methane should be facilitated whenever appropriate to me et the energy needs of both the Commonwealth and the United States; (f) The extraction of methane from mineable coal enhances mine safety, promotes environmental goals and objectives, and conserves an important energy resource; and (g) The Energy Policy Act of 1992 was enacted, in part, to encourage coalbed methane development and the Commonwealth should enact legislation to carry out the purpose of that Act. (2) Therefore, in order to encourage and ensure the fullest practical safe recovery of both coal and coalbed methane, consistent with the above declarations and findings, this chapter is established to: (a) Authorize coalbed methane well permits; 228 ACTS OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY (b) Regulate the design of coalbed methane wells and recovery techniques; (c) Authorize coalbed methane well drilling units and pooling interests therein; (d) Establish field rules; and (e) Provide a process to enable coalbed methane well operators and coalbed methane owners to proceed with the orderly development and production of coalbed methane pendin g the judicial resolution of issues relating to coalbed methane ownership. (3) Notwithstanding subsections (1) and (2) of this section, the General Assembly expressly finds that establishing an orderly process to permit and produce coalbed methane shall in no way be construed to create an inference or presumption as to the ownership of coalbed methane in any judicial or administrative proceeding, or be construed to or be used or interpreted to apply to any well otherwise permitted, approved, or regulated u nder KRS Chapter 353, except for any wells that are to be permitted, converted to, or operated as coalbed methane wells. (4) It is hereby declared to be the public policy of this Commonwealth and in the public interest to: (a) Safeguard, preserve, and protect coal seams for safe mining; facilitate the expeditious, safe evacuation of coalbed methane from the coalbeds of this state; and maintain the ability and right of coal operators at all times to vent coalbed methane from mine areas for the safe recover y of coal; (b) Foster, encourage, and promote the commercial development of the Commonwealth's coalbed methane by establishing procedures for issuing permits and forming drilling units for coalbed methane wells without adversely affecting the safety of mining or the mineability of coal seams; (c) Safeguard, protect, and enforce the correlative rights of coalbed methane operators and coalbed methane owners in a pool of coalbed methane so that each operator and owner may obtain his or her just and equitable share of production from coalbed methane; (d) Create a state permitting procedure and authority to provide for and facilitate coalbed methane development as encouraged by the Energy Policy Act of 1992; and (e) Seek the deletion of the Commonwealth of Kentucky from the list of affected states by the Secretary of the United States Department of Interior as provided for in the Energy Policy Act of 1992.

The person shall request that a pooling order be entered pursuant to subsection (1) of Section 16 of this Act. (4) If no objections are filed within the twenty (20) day period, the department shall immediately issue a drilling permit to the well operator approving the location of the well and authorizing the well operator to proceed to drill at that location, provided all other preconditions to issuance of a permit, as contained in this chapter, have been met. (5) Upon receipt of an application to drill a coalbed methane well, the department shall provide a copy of the required plat and permit application to DSMRE. Within fifteen (15) days of receipt by DSMRE notification shall be se nt to the department by DSMRE as to whether the proposed coalbed methane well will be located within the boundaries of any coal mine for which a permit has been issued or has been applied for pursuant to KRS Chapter 350. If the proposed coalbed methane well is to penetrate a workable coalbed that is within the area of an existing permit for an underground mine issued by DSMRE, or the proposed permitted area of a pending application or permit modification for an underground mine before DSMRE, the written authorization of the mine permittee shall be required prior to issuance by the department of a permit to stimulate, complete, or horizontally drill the coalbed methane well in the workable coalbed that is within the area of an existing permit for an underground mine issued by DSMRE or within the proposed permitted area of a pending application or permit modification for an underground mine before DSMRE. If the proposed coalbed methane well is to be located within a surface area permitted, or proposed in a pend ing application or permit modification to be issued by DSMRE, the written authorization of the mine permittee shall be required prior to issuance by the department of a permit to drill the coalbed methane well. In the absence of the written authorization of the mine permittee, the applicant may file an appeal with the review board requesting approval to drill the proposed coalbed methane well if: (a) Authorization has been denied by the mine permittee; and (b) The proposed location and area to be disturbe d by the proposed coalbed methane well has achieved either a partial bond release status or the bond for the area has been forfeited. SECTION 5. A NEW SECTION OF KRS CHAPTER 349 IS CREATED TO READ AS FOLLOWS: (1) Prior to the abandonment of a coalbed methane well drilled through a workable coalbed, the well operator shall notify, by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by registered mail, all the coal interest holders of the workable coalbed and the department of the operator's intention to plug and abandon the well. The notice shall give the number of the well and its location, and fix the time at which the work of plugging and filling will be commenced. The time shall not be less than fifteen (15) days after the day on which the notice was received, or in due course should be received, by the department. The department shall prescribe the form of notice to be used. A representative of any coal interest holder, at his or her own expense and liability, and of the department may be present at the p lugging and filling of the well. Regardless of whether representatives appear, the well operator may proceed, at the time fixed, to plug and fill the well. When the well is plugged and filled, an affidavit setting forth the time and manner in which the well was plugged shall be made in triplicate by two (2) persons experienced in plugging and filling wells who participated in the work. The affidavit shall be made on forms furnished by the department. One (1) copy of the affidavit shall be retained by the we ll operator, one (1) provided to each coal interest holder, and one (1) provided to the department. (2) In addition to the notification required under subsection (1) of this section, prior to the abandonment of a coalbed methane well the operator shall submit a plugging plan which is subject to approval by the CHAPTER 65 233 Legislative Research Commission PDF Version department. The proposed plugging plan shall be designed to allow coal mining to occur through the well after the well is plugged. (3) If a coalbed methane well ceases to produce in paying quantitie s and no dewatering operations are being conducted for a period of fifteen (15) consecutive months, any coal interest holder or any record oil or gas lessor or lessee of any tract being penetrated by the coalbed methane well, may file a request for hearing pursuant to Section 12 of this Act, to determine whether the well has been abandoned and should be plugged in accordance with this section. However, nothing in this subsection shall require the plugging and abandonment of a coalbed methane well that is be ing temporarily shut in by the coalbed methane well operator. Simultaneously with the filing of a request for a hearing with the department, the person requesting the hearing shall send a copy of the request to the coalbed methane well operator. (4) Any coal interest holder shall have the following rights with respect to a coalbed methane well to be plugged and abandoned: (a) To convert the coalbed methane well to a vent hole or otherwise take the coalbed methane well. In this event the department, upon d etermination that the coal interest holder has placed the coalbed methane well under a mining permit, shall release the coalbed methane well operator's bond and the coalbed methane well operator shall be relieved of further responsibility for the coalbed methane well; and (b) To file an objection concerning the proposed manner or method of plugging with the department, within fifteen (15) days after receipt of notice of intent to plug. The department shall consider any objection and may issue an order spec ifying the manner and method of plugging and reclamation consistent with this section. (5) All coalbed methane wells shall be plugged and abandoned in accordance with this section. The department shall promulgate regulations specifying the manner and method of plugging vertical and horizontal coalbed methane wells and in so doing, or in entering any order for such plugging and abandonment, shall give consideration to the ability to mine any affected coal seam safely and the protection of any affected coal seam for future mining. SECTION 6. A NEW SECTION OF KRS CHAPTER 349 IS CREATED TO READ AS FOLLOWS: (1) If a coalbed methane well is permitted and drilled within the boundaries of any coal mine for which a permit has been issued or an application for a mine permit or a mine permit modification or amendment has been filed but not issued pursuant to KRS Chapter 350, the mine licensee shall have the right to mine through that coalbed methane well and the associated drilling unit in accordance with the provi sions of this subsection. (a) At least one hundred twenty (120) days prior to mining through a coalbed methane well and associated drilling unit, the mine licensee shall notify the review board and operator of its intention to mine through the property. The notice shall be made on a form prescribed by the review board, and shall include a plat showing the location of the drilling unit, the coalbed methane well and associated surface equipment, facilities, infrastructure, and improvements, and the geographi c extent of the mining operations to be conducted within the drilling unit. The mine licensee shall also submit an estimated schedule for commencing and completing mining operations within the drilling unit. After a hearing the review board shall promptly issue a written determination on whether the continued operation of the coalbed methane well will impede, interfere with, or present a possible safety hazard to the mine licensee's planned mining operations. If the review board determines that the coalbed methane well will impede, interfere with, or present a safety hazard to the planned mining operations, concurrently an order shall be issued to the operators, with a copy to the mine licensee, directing the temporary or permanent plugging of the well at the operator's cost and such other action as may be appropriate in the circumstances. Following the issuance of the order, the review board shall promptly issue a mine through certificate to the mine licensee, with a copy to the operator, authorizing the min e licensee to mine -through the coalbed methane well and associated drilling unit. (b) The mine licensee and all other coal interest holders having interests in the coalbed within the drilling unit shall have no duty or obligation to compensate or pay the operator or other interested coalbed methane parties for any causes of action, claims, or damages arising from the suspension or loss of coalbed methane production or the plugging and abandonment of a coalbed methane well 234 ACTS OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY and the removal or relocation of a ny associated facilities, infrastructure, and improvements due to mining through the coalbed methane well and associated drilling unit pursuant to this subsection. (2) If a mine licensee files an application for a coal mine permit or seeks to modify or amend an existing coal mine permit so as to include a geographical area containing one (1) or more existing coalbed methane wells or any well sites for which drilling permits have been issued or are pending, the mine licensee shall have the right to mine thr ough those coalbed methane wells or into or through a coalbed methane well and the associated drilling units and any well sites for which permits to drill have been issued or applications for permits to drill have been filed but not issued in accordance with the provisions of this subsection. (a) At least one hundred eighty (180) days prior to mining into or through one (1) or more drilling units or permitted well sites operated by a common operator, the mine licensee shall notify the review board and the operator of its intention to mine into or through the property. The notice shall be made on a form prescribed by the review board and shall include a plat showing the location of the drilling unit, the coalbed methane well and associated surface equipment, facilities, infrastructure, and improvements, and the geographic extent of the mining operations to be conducted within the drilling unit. The mine licensee shall also submit an estimated schedule for commencing and completing mining operations within the drilling unit. (b) Within thirty (30) days after receiving the mine licensee's notice pursuant to paragraph (a) of this subsection, the mine licensee and operator shall enter into a confidentiality agreement on a form prescribed by the review board and the operator shall provide, to the extent available, copies of all data and information necessary and appropriate to enable the mine licensee to determine the current value of each drilling unit, well site, and any associated assets described in the mine li censee's notice in accordance with the criteria set forth in paragraph (e) of this subsection. The information shall be in a form prescribed by the review board and shall include, among other things, data, reports, and information relating to current coalbed methane reserve calculations, well completions, historic production and sales results, capital and operating costs, all actual land, legal permitting, survey, title, and any other costs and expenses directly relating to the acquisition, permitting, deve lopment, and operation of each drilling unit and well site, and estimated well plugging and abandonment costs of any existing coalbed methane wells. In addition, the operator shall provide the review board and mine licensee with copies of all agreements and leases, payment division orders and any pooling agreements or pooling orders for each drilling unit and well site, together with a schedule setting forth the name, address, and working interest and net revenue percentages, royalties and overriding royalt ies, and all other interests and rights of all other interested coalbed methane parties. If the information is not timely filed or is incomplete, the mine licensee may seek an order from the review board directing the operator to comply with the provisions of this subsection. (c) Within thirty (30) days after receiving the information described in paragraph (b) of this subsection, the mine licensee and operator shall meet and confer at a mutually agreed upon date, time, and place for the purpose of attempt ing to conclude a mutually acceptable agreement as to the compensation due to the operator for any damage, impairment, or loss to each drilling unit, well site, and any associated assets described in the information provided by the operator resulting from the mine licensee's planned mine -through operations. Any compensation agreement between the mine licensee and operator for each drilling unit or well site shall be approved and executed by all other interested coalbed methane parties. The mine licensee and operator shall jointly notify the review board that a compensation agreement has been entered into between the parties and request that the review board issue a mine -through certificate for each drilling unit and well site described in the notice. The notice shall include any terms and conditions set forth in the compensation agreement that the parties have agreed to incorporate in the applicable mine -through certificates. Upon receipt of the executed compensation agreement, the review board shall promptly issue the requested mine - through certificates to the mine licensee, with copies to the operator and all other interested coalbed methane parties. If the parties are unable to reach an agreement, within ten (10) days following the expiration of the thirty (30) day meet and confer period, either party may request a hearing before the review board for the purpose of determining the compensation due the operator and any terms and conditions to be imposed upon the mine licensee's proposed mining operations. Cop ies of the hearing request shall be sent to all other interested coalbed methane parties. (d) Within fifteen (15) days of receiving the hearing request, the review board shall schedule a hearing to take place within sixty (60) days and shall notify the mine licensee, the operator and all other interested coalbed methane parties of the date, time, and location of the hearing. At its election, the CHAPTER 65 235 Legislative Research Commission PDF Version review board may engage a qualified petroleum engineer for the purpose of conducting an independent evaluation o f the compensation to be paid to the operator and all other interested coalbed methane parties in accordance with paragraph (e) of this subsection. The mine licensee and the operator shall each pay one -half (1/2) of the costs and expenses for the petroleum engineer retained by the review board. (e) The review board shall determine the value of each drilling unit, well site, and all associated assets before and after the mine licensee's planned mine -through operations. In determining the amount of compensat ion due the operator and all other interested coalbed methane parties, the review board must consider all relevant evidence and information submitted and the review board shall base its decision solely upon the following criteria and procedures: 1. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this subsection, all coalbed methane reserve estimates and the valuation of reserves and other assets damaged, impaired, or lost due to the planned mining operations shall be consistent with standard oil and gas industry accounting, engineering, and reserve practices and shall be performed pursuant to the then -current applicable laws, regulations, policies, and guidelines for determining gas reserves for public reporting companies in the United States. 2. At the hearing, the mine licensee and operator, on behalf of itself and all other interested coalbed methane parties, shall appear and submit evidence and testimony as to the value of the subject drilling units, well sites, and any associated assets before and after the mine licensee's planned mining operations. The review board shall only consider coalbed methane reserve estimates or valuation determinations made in conformity with subparagraph 1. of this paragraph by a professional petroleum engineer with experience in evaluating coalbed methane reserves and operations. All reserve estimates and any valuation analysis prepared by the mine licensee and operator for use in the review board's hearing shall be effective thirty (30) days prior to the date of the hearing. The reserve estimates and valuation analysis shall be exchanged between the mine licensee and operator and copies of the information shall be provided to the review board and all other interested coalbed methane parties no less than twenty -one (21) days prior to the hearing date. Any coalbed methane reserve estimates or valuation analysis prepared at the review board's request shall be set forth in a written report. Copies of the report prepared for the review board shall be provided to the mine licensee, the operator, and all other interested coalbed methane parties no less than ten (10) days prior to the review board's hearing date. 3. All estimates of remaining recoverable coalbed methane reserves immediately before and immediately after the planned mining operations shall consist of proved developed producing or proved developed nonproducing reserves as determined pursuant to this subsection. A drilling unit shall have proved developed producing reserves if the unit has an operating coalbed methane well, whi ch is completed in one (1) or more target coal seams and is producing commercial quantities of coalbed methane. The drilling units total proved developed producing reserves before and after the planned mining operations shall be calculated based on the completed coal seams within the unit well. A drilling unit shall have proved developed nonproducing reserves if the unit has a coalbed methane well which is completed in one (1) or more target coal seams and is fully operational and all associated infrastruct ure such as power, gas gathering, and water management systems required to produce and sell coalbed methane in commercial quantities has been constructed, but the well is not producing coalbed methane in commercial quantities because it either is in the dewatering stage or is not operating due to factors beyond the operator's control. Whether a drilling unit contains proved developed producing reserves or proved developed nonproducing reserves shall be determined based on the status of the coalbed methane w ell and associated infrastructure sixty (60) days prior to the review board's hearing date. 4. The net present value of proved developed producing reserves projected immediately before and immediately after the planned mining operations shall be calculated using a discount rate of twelve percent (12%). The net present value of proved developed nonproducing reserves projected immediately before and immediately after the planned mining operations shall be calculated using a discount rate of twenty percent (2 0%). The valuation analysis shall also 236 ACTS OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY project the net present value of all revenues received, if any, by the operator during the period in which the planned mining operations are to be conducted. 5. In determining the compensation due the operator and all other interested coalbed methane parties for delayed or lost production, if the total projected production of the coalbed methane well is reduced so as not to yield a commercially reasonable return on investment to the operator, but the well is still abl e to produce coalbed methane in commercial quantities, the projected difference in the net present value of the recoverable reserves before and after mining shall be included as part of the compensation due the operator and all other interested coalbed methane parties. 6. In determining the value of the coalbed methane reserves impaired or lost due to the planned mining operations, except as expressly provided herein, no consideration shall be given to undeveloped coalbed methane resources in coal seams wh ich have not been completed in the subject coalbed methane well or which are in coal seams below the total depth of the well bore. If, however, a coal seam in the same field is producing coalbed methane but the coal seam is not completed in the subject coalbed methane well, the operator may submit evidence to the review board for its consideration as to the potential net present value of the resources within the uncompleted seam, but in no event shall the net present value of those resources be discounted a t less than thirty percent (30%). 7. Except as otherwise provided herein, in determining the value of coalbed methane for purposes of this subsection, the gas price shall be the last published price in the gas market closest to the drilling unit sixty (60) days prior to the review board's hearing date. If the coalbed methane is sold pursuant to a gas sales agreement or marketing contract in which the gas price is determined based on a published price, subject to any contractual adjustment, in the gas marke t other than the market closest to the drilling unit, the gas price shall be determined based on the last published price in a gas market referred to in the gas sales agreement or marketing contract, subject to any contractual adjustment set forth therein, sixty (60) days prior to the review board's hearing date. If the coalbed methane is sold pursuant to an arms -length firm or fixed price gas sales agreement or marketing contract, the actual sales price received by operator for gas sold sixty (60) days pri or to the review board's hearing date shall be used as the gas price in the coalbed methane valuation. 8. All capital, operating, and production costs used in the net present value determinations made pursuant to this subsection shall be based on the operator's then current reasonable and verifiable actual costs and expenses. Copies of all relevant and available cost information shall be provided by the operator to the review board and mine licensee as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection. If actua l cost information is not otherwise available, all calculations shall be made using reasonable and customary costs for comparable coalbed methane operations in the Commonwealth and in the surrounding states. 9. If the planned mining operations will mine through a coalbed methane well or require the removal, relocation, or suspension of operation of other facilities, infrastructure, or improvements in a drilling unit, the operator and any other interested coalbed methane parties shall be reimbursed for all reasonable actual and direct costs, damages, and expenses to be incurred due to these mining operations; provided, however, that in no event shall any replacement costs and expenses exceed the operator's or any other interested coalbed methane parties' actual costs and expenses for the affected well, facilities, infrastructure, and improvements, as the case may be. The operator and any other interested coalbed methane parties shall not be reimbursed for any general, administrative, or overhead costs and expenses or any other costs and expenses not otherwise allocated to the costs of the subject drilling unit, coalbed methane well and the associated facilities, infrastructure, and improvements. Any amounts due the operator and any other interested coalbed methane parties shall be reduced by the projected then -current market value of such equipment, facilities, and improvements to the extent that it can be salvaged and sold or used in other operations. 10. If, prior to drilling a coalbed methane well, the mine licensee submits a plan to mine into or through any part of the associated drilling unit or well site for which a drilling permit has been issued or is pending, the operator shall not proceed with drilling a coalbed methane well CHAPTER 65 237 Legislative Research Commission PDF Version pending a final decision by the review board with respect to the mine licensee's request for a mine -through certificate. When a mine -through certificate is issued to the mine licensee, the operator and all other interested coalbed methane parties shall be reimbursed for all reasona ble costs and verifiable actual land, legal, permitting, surveying, and technical costs and expenses incurred to acquire or lease and maintain the property and obtain any permits, approvals, and other agreements required to drill the coalbed methane well. The operator and all other interested coalbed methane parties shall not be reimbursed for any general, administrative, or overhead costs and expenses or any other costs and expenses not otherwise allocated to the costs to acquire or lease the subject prope rty or permit the coalbed methane well. (f) At a hearing, the review board shall take testimony and evidence from the mine licensee and operator, on behalf of itself and all other interested coalbed methane parties consistent with the provisions in this subsection. Within fifteen (15) days following the hearing, the review board shall issue a written decision to the mine licensee and operator determining the compensation due the operator and each of the other interested coalbed methane parties in the amoun t of the difference between the value of each drilling unit, well site, and any associated assets before and after the mine licensee's planned mining operations. If the review board determines that the mine licensee's proposed mining operations will result in a loss or taking of all of either the coalbed methane reserves in the coal seam to be mined and all coalbed methane reserves in completed coal seams in the coalbed methane well below the mined coal seam as provided in paragraph (e)5. of this subsection or the entire drilling unit, the operator and other interested coalbed methane parties shall be awarded the full value of the property and assets prior to the proposed mining operations as determined by the review board. The review board's decision shall list the compensation amounts to be paid to the operator and each of the other interested coalbed methane parties for each drilling unit, well site, and any associated assets. The decision shall also set forth any duties or obligations to be performed by t he parties, such as the temporary or permanent plugging of any well or the relocation or removal of any surface facilities, to enable the mine licensee to proceed immediately with the planned mining operations. (g) Within fifteen (15) days of receiving the review board's decision, the mine licensee shall notify the review board and the operator and all other interested coalbed methane parties of its decision to: 1. Accept the review board's decision with respect to one (1) or more of the drilling units, w ell sites, and associated assets and deposit the compensation awarded to the operator and each of the other interested coalbed methane parties for the property; 2. Appeal all or part of the review board's decision as provided in paragraph (j) of this subsection; or 3. Withdraw notice of intent to mine into any of the subject coalbed methane property and assets. If the mine licensee elects to withdraw notice of intent to mine into or through all of the drilling units, well sites, and any associated assets which were the subject of the review board hearing, upon receiving a statement of costs from the operator, the mine licensee shall promptly reimburse the operator for all reasonable out -of-pocket engineering and legal costs and expenses incurred to prepare for and participate in the review board hearing and shall have no further obligations to the operator or any of the other interested coalbed methane parties. (h) Within fifteen (15) days of receiving the review board's decision, the operator, on behalf o f itself and other interested coalbed methane parties, shall notify the review board and the mine licensee whether it will accept the amounts awarded by the review board or file an appeal with the Circuit Court in the county where the drilling unit or well site is located challenging the review board's valuation of any of the property or assets. (i) If no appeal of the review board's decision is filed by the parties, upon receipt of the compensation due the operator and all other interested coalbed methane parties for each drilling unit and well site selected by the mine licensee for which a mine -through certificate will be issued, the review board shall promptly deliver the awarded compensation to the operator and all other interested coalbed methane parties for the drilling unit and well site and concurrently issue the appropriate mine - through certificate to the mine licensee, with copies to the operator and all other interested coalbed 238 ACTS OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY methane parties. If the operator and other interested coalbed methane parties are awarded either the total net present value of the coalbed methane reserves in coal seams to be mined by the mine licensee and all coalbed methane reserves in coal seams completed in a coalbed methane well below such coal seam as provided in subparagraph 5. of paragraph (e)5. of this subsection or the total value of the entire drilling unit and associated assets, upon payment of the compensation, the operator and other interested coalbed methane parties shall simultaneously, if requested by the m ine licensee, assign and transfer free and clear of all encumbrances to the mine licensee all of their respective rights, title, and interests in such property and assets, as the case may be, within the drilling unit on a form to be prescribed by the review board. The review board shall take whatever other action that may be deemed appropriate or necessary in the circumstances. (j) If either party notifies the review board of a decision to appeal the review board's valuation of any of the subject coalbed m ethane properties and assets to the Circuit Court, the mine licensee shall deposit with the review board the compensation due the operator and each of the other interested coalbed methane parties for each drilling unit, well site and any associated assets selected by the mine licensee for which a mine -through certificate will be issued. Upon receipt of the funds from the mine licensee, the review board shall promptly deliver to the operator and the other interested coalbed methane parties one hundred percen t (100%) of the awarded compensation for any drilling unit, well site and any associated assets not listed in any notice of appeal and seventy -five percent (75%) of the awarded compensation to the operator and other interested coalbed methane parties for any drilling unit, well site, and any associated assets for which an appeal is to be filed. Concurrently with delivering the awarded compensation to the operator as provided herein, the review board shall issue to the mine licensee, with copies to the opera tor and all other interested coalbed methane parties, a mine -through certificate for each drilling unit and well site for which compensation has been received. If the review board's decision with respect to any drilling unit is not appealed and the operator and other interested coalbed methane parties are awarded either the total net present value of the coalbed methane reserves in the coal seam to be mined by the mine licensee and all coalbed methane reserves in coal seams completed in a coalbed methane we ll below that coal seam as provided in paragraph (e)5. of this subsection or the total value of each drilling unit, well site, and any associated assets, upon payment of the compensation, the operator and other interested coalbed methane parties shall simultaneously if requested by the mine licensee, assign and transfer free and clear of all encumbrances to the mine licensee all of their respective rights, title, and interests in that property and assets, as the case may be, within the drilling unit or well site on a form to be prescribed by the review board. The review board shall take whatever other action that may be deemed appropriate or necessary in the circumstances to carry out its decision. All funds deposited with the review board shall be placed in an interest -bearing account pending a final resolution of any appeals. (k) Within thirty (30) days following the issuance of the review board's decision, the mine licensee or the operator, on behalf of itself and any other interested coalbed methane part ies, may file a petition in the Circuit Court of the county in which the drilling unit or well site is located or in the Franklin County Circuit Court disputing the review board's valuation of all or any part of any coalbed methane properties or assets pursuant to this subsection. The parties filing the petition shall name as parties to the action the following: the review board, the mine licensee, all other coal interest holders, the operator, and all other interested coalbed methane parties. Promptly upon receiving notice of the petition, the review board shall deliver any remaining funds deposited by the mine licensee as provided in paragraph (j) of this subsection, together with all interest accrued thereon, to the clerk of the Circuit Court for the county in which the petition is filed and these funds shall be deposited in an interest bearing account pending a decision on the petition. The decision of the Circuit Court shall be made in accordance with the provisions of Section 18 of this Act. If the Circ uit Court determines the operator and other interested coalbed methane parties are entitled to greater compensation than the amount awarded by the review board, the mine licensee shall pay the difference to the clerk of the Circuit Court within fifteen (15) days of the court's decision. Upon receipt of the additional funds awarded by the Circuit Court, the clerk shall promptly deliver to the operator and any other interested coalbed methane parties these funds together with all interest accrued thereon. If the Circuit Court determines that the operator is entitled to less compensation than the amount awarded by the review board, the amount of the reduction shall be refunded to the mine licensee together with any interest that accrued thereon. If the escrowed funds are not sufficient to fully reimburse the mine licensee, the operator and all other interested coalbed methane parties having an interest in the CHAPTER 65 239 Legislative Research Commission PDF Version subject coalbed methane properties and assets shall promptly pay the mine licensee for the difference between the escrowed funds and the total amount to be reimbursed pursuant to the Circuit Court's order. If the Circuit Court determines that the operator and other interested coalbed methane parties are to receive either the total net present value of the coalbed methane reserves in the coal seam to be mined by the mine licensee and all coalbed methane reserves in coal seams completed in a coalbed methane well below such coal seam as provided in paragraph (e)5. of this subsection or the total value of the ent ire drilling unit, well site, and any associated assets, which values may be increased or decreased by the Circuit Court, upon receipt of the awarded compensation, the operator and other interested coalbed methane parties shall simultaneously if requested by the mine licensee, assign and transfer free and clear of all encumbrances to the mine licensee all of their respective rights, title, and interest in such property and assets, as the case may be, within the drilling unit on a form to be prescribed by th e review board. (l) Subject to obtaining a decision by the Circuit Court with respect to any appeals initiated pursuant to paragraph (k) of this subsection, the operator and all of the other interested coalbed methane parties' acceptance of the compensation awarded by the review board and of the performance of any duties and obligations by the mine licensee as ordered by the review board shall constitute full and complete consideration to the operator and all of the other interested coalbed methane parties for any and all causes of action, claims, damages, or losses to each drilling unit or any portion thereof, well site, or any associated assets caused by the mine licensee, or any other coal interest holder's subsequent mining operations. The mine licensee shall be liable for any and all injuries, deaths, or damages proximately caused by the mine licensee on, in, or with respect to that property. (3) If, after the mine licensee files a notice of intention to mine into or through any coalbed methane propert ies or assets pursuant to subsection (1) or (2) of this section, the mine licensee's coal mining permit or any pending amendment to an existing permit issued pursuant to KRS Chapter 350 is withdrawn, canceled, delayed, or modified so as to exclude all or any part of the geographic area covering any drilling unit or well site described in the mine licensee's notice, the mine licensee shall promptly advise the review board and operator that it is amending its request for a mine -through certificate to exclude any property that is no longer subject to a coal mine permit or a pending coal mine permit application. SECTION 7. A NEW SECTION OF KRS CHAPTER 349 IS CREATED TO READ AS FOLLOWS: (1) This chapter shall apply to all lands located in the Commonwealth however owned including lands owned or administered by any government or any agency or political subdivision thereof, over which the Commonwealth has jurisdiction under its police power. (2) The waste of coalbed methane is hereby prohibited. The waste prohib ited includes physical waste as that term is generally understood in the oil, gas, and coalbed methane industry, giving consideration to coal mining operations and the safe recovery of coal and includes: (a) The locating, drilling, equipping, operating, or producing of any coalbed methane well or wells drilled, deepened, or reopened in a manner that causes or tends to cause a reduction in the quantity of coalbed methane ultimately recoverable from a pool under prudent and proper operations, or contrary to any provision of, or any order, rule or administrative regulation promulgated or issued under this chapter; (b) Permitting the migration of coalbed methane from the stratum in which it is found into other strata, thereby ultimately resulting in the loss of recoverable coalbed methane; (c) The drowning with water of any stratum or part thereof capable of producing coalbed methane in paying quantities, except for secondary recovery purposes, or in hydraulic fracturing or other completion practices; (d) The unlawful damage to underground, fresh, or mineral water supply, coalbeds, or other mineral deposits in the operations for the discovery, development, production, or handling of coalbed methane; (e) The unnecessary or excessive loss of coalbed methane by spillage or venting or destruction of coalbed methane or its constituents; and (f) The drilling of more wells than are reasonably required to recover efficiently the maximum amount of coalbed methane from a pool. 240 ACTS OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY (3) For purposes of this chapter, waste d oes not include coalbed methane vented or released from any mine area, the degasification of a coal seam for the safe recovery of coal, the plugging of coalbed methane wells for the safe recovery of coal, or the conversion of coalbed methane wells to vent holes for the safe recovery of coal. (4) The sale or use of coalbed methane from any coalbed methane well unless a permit has been issued as required by Section 8 of this Act, or in violation of the spacing provisions of Section 15 of this Act, shall be prohibited. (5) No person shall conduct coalbed methane operations unless that person has first obtained the necessary permits, including surface discharge and underground injection control permits, as appropriate for the particular operation to be conducted. The department shall notify state and federal agencies with jurisdiction over the protection of surface waters and groundwater when permit applications are filed and shall, to the extent possible, coordinate permit review. SECTION 8. A NEW SECTION O F KRS CHAPTER 349 IS CREATED TO READ AS FOLLOWS: (1) It is unlawful for any person to drill, commence, operate, deepen, convert, or stimulate any coalbed methane well, to conduct any horizontal drilling of a coalbed methane well or to convert any existing oil or natural gas well to a coalbed methane well, without first securing from the department a permit pursuant to this chapter. Before any well, borehole, or facility initially used for a coal mining related purpose, such as a vent hole, is converted for the purpose of recovering coalbed methane for sale or use, the operator shall obtain a permit and comply with the provisions of this chapter prior to the time that the well, borehole, or facility is converted or used for the purpose of recovering coalbed methane for sale or use. It is unlawful for any person to drill, deepen, convert, or reopen a coalbed methane well for the production of oil or natural gas or for the injection of water, gas, or other fluids into any oil or natural gas producing formation until the person has obtained a permit from the department for a petroleum or natural gas well pursuant to KRS 353.570.

However, this subsection and any subsidence waivers shall in no way waive, affect, or impair the ability of the applicant or the applicant's successors or assigns to pursue any remedies for damages to persons, or to improved or tangible property, suffered or incurred as a result of any subsiden ce caused by the mine licensee or the mine licensee's successors or assigns. The mine licensee, its successors or assigns, shall be liable for any and all damages to persons or to improved or tangible property proximately caused by the mine licensee. (7) If the mine licensee is mining in a coal seam that is not being produced by the coalbed methane well operator and has not exercised his or her mine -through rights, as set forth in subsection (1) or (2) of Section 6 of this Act, in any coal mine before remo ving any coal or other material or driving any entry or passageway within five hundred (500) horizontal feet of the vertical segment of a coalbed methane well or within fifty (50) vertical feet of the horizontal segment of a coalbed methane well, the mine licensee shall forward simultaneously to the well operator and to the department, by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by registered mail, a copy of the maps and plans required by law to be filed and kept up to date. Maps or plans shall show the mine workings and projected mine workings within five hundred (500) horizontal feet of the coalbed methane well. However, the issuance of any coalbed methane well permit shall not preclude or prevent coal mining outside two hundred (200) feet, but not closer than fifty (50) feet, of the vertical segment of a coalbed methane well or outside of the workable coalbed in which the horizontal segment of a coalbed methane well is located, unless specified by the department for reasons of mine or well safety. The mine licensee shall not mine within fifty (50) feet of the vertical segment of a coalbed methane well without the written authorization of the coalbed methane well operator. A mine licensee may file a request with the department to mine closer than two hundred (200) feet of the vertical segment of the coalbed methane well. The mine licensee shall forward simultaneously to the well operator and the department, by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by registered mail, a request to mine closer than t wo hundred (200) feet, but not closer than fifty (50) feet, of the vertical segment of the coalbed methane well, which shall be accompanied by the following: (a) A copy of the maps and plans required by law to be filed and kept up to date, showing on the copy of the map or plan its mine plan workings and projected mine workings beneath the tract of land and within two hundred (200) feet, but not closer than fifty (50) feet, of the vertical segment of the coalbed methane well; and (b) A statement that the applicant has met and conferred with, or offered to met and confer with, the well operator concerning the mine licensee's plan to mine closer than two hundred (200) feet, but not closer than fifty (50) feet, of the vertical segment of the coalbed methane well. The well operator may, within twenty (20) days of receipt of the documents listed in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subsection, file specific objections in writing with the department. When objections are filed, the department shall provide a copy o f the objections to the mine licensee and fix a time and place for an informal hearing. The hearing shall be held not more than ten (10) days from the end of the twenty (20) day period. At the hearing, the mine licensee and the well operator, in person or by representative, shall consider the objections and seek agreement on the character and the extent of operations to be conducted within less than two hundred (200) feet, but not closer than fifty (50) feet, of the vertical segment of the coalbed methane w ell. If no agreement can be reached, the department, after administrative hearing conducted in accordance with KRS Chapter 13B, shall make a decision defining what coal, if any, is CHAPTER 65 243 Legislative Research Commission PDF Version necessary to be left for the safe protection, use, and operation of the well. The department's decision shall be subject to appeal by either party as provided in this chapter. The department shall keep a complete record of all hearings. The mine licensee shall, every six (6) months, while mining within two hundred (200) feet, but not closer than fifty (50) feet, of the vertical segment of the coalbed methane well, file up -to- date maps and plans required by this section, or file new maps and plans complete to date. (8) The department may deny the issuance of a permit if it determines that the applicant has a documented pattern or practice of substantial violations of the provisions of this chapter and has failed to abate or seek review of the violations. If the department finds that a substantial violation has occurred with respect to existing operations and that the operator has failed to abate or seek review of the violation in the time prescribed, the department may suspend the permit. After a suspension, the operator shall forthwith cease all work being conducted under the permit until the department reinstates the permit. The department shall make a written finding of its determination and may enforce the determination in Circuit Court pursuant to Section 29 of this Act. SECTION 9. A NEW SECTION OF KRS CHAPTER 349 IS CREATED TO READ AS FOLLOWS: (1) When two (2) or more separately owned tracts, or portions thereof, are embraced within a drilling unit, or when there are separately owned interests in all or part of any such drilling unit, the operators or owners of coalbed methane owning the interests may pool their interests for the development and operation of the drilling unit by voluntary agreement. These agreements may be based on the exercise of pooling rights or rights to establish units which are granted in any gas or oil lease, coal lease, coalbed methane lease, or similar instrument. (2) No voluntary pooling agreement between or among coalbed methane operators or owners shall be held to violate the statutory or common law of the Commonwealth which prohibits monopolies or acts, arrangements, contracts, combinations, or conspiracies in restraint of trade or commerce. SECTION 10. A NEW SECTION OF KRS CHAPTER 349 IS CREATED TO READ AS FOLLOWS: (1) If any coal interest holder has objected to the proposed stimulation pursu ant to subsection (1) of Section 4 of this Act, no permit shall be issued to stimulate a coalbed methane well unless the applicant has obtained and filed with the department an agreement between the coal interest holders of any workable coalbed within five hundred (500) horizontal feet of the proposed coalbed methane well to be stimulated and within the five hundred (500) foot horizontal radius and feet fifty (50) vertical feet above or below the workable coalbed proposed to be stimulated.

(4) In establishing or modifying a drilling unit for coalbed methane wells, and in order to accommodate the unique characteristics of coalbed methane de velopment, the review board may require that drilling units conform to the mine development plan, if any. If requested by the coal interest holder, well locations and spacing shall correspond with mine operations, including the drilling of multiple coalbed methane wells on the same surface location of each drilling unit. 248 ACTS OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY (5) If an order to establish or modify a drilling unit, field rules or unitization of coalbed methane wells, pools or fields will allow a coalbed methane well to be drilled into or through a workable coalbed, any coal interest holder and any record oil and gas lessor and lessee within the area to be covered by the drilling unit, field rules or unitization of coalbed methane wells, pools or fields may object to the establishment or modification of the drilling unit, field rules or unitization of coalbed methane wells, pools or fields. (6) The review board may continue a hearing to allow for further investigation and the gathering and taking of additional data and evidence. If at any time dur ing a hearing there is not sufficient evidence for the review board to determine field boundaries, or drilling unit size or shape, the review board may enter a temporary order establishing provisional drilling units, and field boundaries for the orderly development of the pool or field, pending receipt of the information necessary to determine the ultimate pool or field boundaries, and spacing of wells for the pool or field. Upon additional findings of fact, the boundaries of a pool or field and drilling un its for the pool or field may be modified by the review board. (7) Unless otherwise provided for by the review board, after an application for a hearing to establish or modify drilling units or pool boundaries has been filed, no additional wells shall be permitted in the pool or field until the review board's order establishing or modifying the pool or field or unit has been entered. (8) After the review board issues a field or pool spacing order which creates drilling units or a pattern of drilling units for a pool or field, should an operator or owner of coalbed methane apply for a permit or otherwise indicate a desire to drill a coalbed methane well outside of such drilling units or pattern of drilling units and thereby potentially extend the pool or field, the review board may, on its own motion or the motion of any interested person, require that the coalbed methane well be located and drilled in compliance with the provisions of the order affecting the pool or field.

Approved April 7, 2004 CHAPTER 75 (SB 246) AN ACT relating to construction of certain electric transmission lines. Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky: Section 1. KRS 278.020 is amended to read as follows: (1) No person, partnership, public or private corporation, or combination thereof shall commence providing utility service to or for the public or begin the construction of any plant, equipment, property, or facility for furnishing to the public any of the services enumerated in KRS 278.010, except retail electric suppliers for service connections to electric -consuming facilities located within its certified territory and ordinary extensions of existing systems in the usual course of business, until that person has obtained from the Public Service Commission a certificate that public co nvenience and necessity require the service or construction. Upon the filing of an application for a certificate, and after any public hearing which the commission may in its discretion conduct for all interested parties, the commission may issue or refuse to issue the certificate, or issue it in part and refuse it in part, except that the commission shall not refuse or modify an application submitted under KRS 278.023 without consent by the parties to the agreement. The commission, when considering an application for a certificate to construct a base load electric generating facility, may consider the policy of the General Assembly to foster and encourage use of Kentucky coal by electric utilities serving the Commonwealth. Unless exercised within one (1) year from the grant thereof, exclusive of any delay due to the order of any court or failure to obtain any necessary grant or consent, the authority conferred by the issuance of the certificate of convenience and necessity shall be void, but the beginning of any new construction or facility in good faith within the time prescribed by the commission and the prosecution thereof with reasonable diligence shall constitute an exercise of authority under the certificate. (2) For the purposes of this section, construction of any electric transmission line of one hundred thirty -eight (138) kilovolts or more and of more than five thousand two hundred eighty (5,280) feet in length shall not 278 ACTS OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY be considered an ordinary extension of an existing system in the usual course o f business and shall require a certificate of public convenience and necessity. However, ordinary extensions of existing systems in the usual course of business not requiring such a certificate shall include: (a) The replacement or upgrading of any existing electric transmission line; or (b) The relocation of any existing electric transmission line to accommodate construction or expansion of a roadway or other transportation infrastructure; or (c) An electric transmission line that is constructed solely to serve a single customer and that will pass over no property other than that owned by the customer to be served. (3) No utility shall exercise any right or privilege under any franchise or permit, after the exercise of that right or privilege has been voluntarily suspended or discontinued for more than one (1) year, without first obtaining from the commission, in the manner provided in subsection (1) of this section, a certificate of convenience and necessity authorizing the exercise of that right or pri vilege. (4)[(3)] No utility shall apply for or obtain any franchise, license, or permit from any city or other governmental agency until it has obtained from the commission, in the manner provided in subsection (1) of this section, a certificate of convenience and necessity showing that there is a demand and need for the service sought to be rendered. (5)[(4)] No person shall acquire or transfer ownership of, or control, or the right to control, any utility under the jurisdiction of the commission by sale of assets, transfer of stock, or otherwise, or abandon the same, without prior approval by the commission. The commission shall grant its approval if the person acquiring the utility has the financial, technical, and managerial abilities to provide reasonable service. (6)[(5)] No individual, group, syndicate, general or limited partnership, association, corporation, joint stock company, trust, or other entity (an \"acquirer\"), whether or not organized under the laws of this state, shall acquire control, ei ther directly or indirectly, of any utility furnishing utility service in this state, without having first obtained the approval of the commission. Any acquisition of control without prior authorization shall be void and of no effect. As used in this subsection, the term \"control\" means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a utility, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by effecting a change in the composition of the board of directors, by contract or otherwise. Control shall be presumed to exist if any individual or entity, directly or indirectly, owns ten percent (10%) or more of the voting securities of the utility. This presumption may be rebutted by a showing that ownership does not in fact confer control. Application for any approval or authorization shall be made to the commission in writing, verified by oath or affirmation, and be in a form and contain the information as the commission requires. The commi ssion shall approve any proposed acquisition when it finds that the same is to be made in accordance with law, for a proper purpose and is consistent with the public interest. The commission may make investigation and hold hearings in the matter as it deems necessary, and thereafter may grant any application under this subsection in whole or in part and with modification and upon terms and conditions as it deems necessary or appropriate. The commission shall grant, modify, refuse, or prescribe appropriate t erms and conditions with respect to every such application within sixty (60) days after the filing of the application therefor, unless it is necessary, for good cause shown, to continue the application for up to sixty (60) additional days. The order continuing the application shall state fully the facts that make continuance necessary. In the absence of that action within that period of time, any proposed acquisition shall be deemed to be approved. (7)[(6)] Subsection (6)[(5)] of this section shall not app ly to any acquisition of control of any: (a) Utility which derives a greater percentage of its gross revenue from business in another jurisdiction than from business in this state if the commission determines that the other jurisdiction has statutes or rules which are applicable and are being applied and which afford protection to ratepayers in this state substantially equal to that afforded such ratepayers by subsection (6)[(5)] of this section; (b) Utility by an acquirer who directly, or indirectly thro ugh one (1) or more intermediaries, controls, or is controlled by, or is under common control with, the utility, including any entity created at the direction of such utility for purposes of corporate reorganization; or (c) Utility pursuant to the terms of any indebtedness of the utility, provided the issuance of indebtedness was approved by the commission. CHAPTER 75 279 Legislative Research Commission PDF Version (8) In a proceeding on an application filed pursuant to this section, any interested person, including a person over whose property the proposed trans mission line will cross, may request intervention, and the commission shall, if requested, conduct a public hearing in the county in which the transmission line is proposed to be constructed, or, if the transmission line is proposed to be constructed in more than one county, in one of those counties. The commission shall issue its decision no later than ninety (90) days after the application is filed, unless the commission extends this period, for good cause, to one hundred twenty (120) days. The commission may utilize the provisions of KRS 278.255(3) if, in the exercise of its discretion, it deems it necessary to hire a competent, qualified and independent firm to assist it in reaching its decision. The issuance by the commission of a certificate that public convenience and necessity require the construction of an electric transmission line shall be deemed to be a determination by the commission that, as of the date of issuance, the construction of the line is a prudent investment. (9)[(7)] If any provision of this section or the application thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity shall not affect other provisions or applications of this section which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to that end the provisions are declared to be severable. Section 2.

However, in no event shall a small telephone utility so adjust: 1. Its basic business rate, including zone charges, if the resulting average basic business rate, including zone charges, would thereby exceed the average basic business rate, including zone charges, of the largest telephone utility; 2. Its basic residential rate, including zone charges, if the resulting average basic residential rate would thereby exceed the average basic residential rate including zone charges, of the largest telephone utility; or 3. If its average basic business rate, including zone charges, its average basic residential rate, including zone charges, or its installation charges for basic business or basic residential services would be increased by more than twenty percent (20%). (b) At least sixty (60) calendar days before the effective date of such an adjustment of its rates or charges, a small telephone utility shall file a copy of its revised ra tes and tariffs with the commission and shall mail notice of the proposed rate adjustment to each affected subscriber and the commission.

(c) If by the forty -fifth calendar day following the date of the notice to subscribers of such a proposed adjustment to its rates or charges, the commission has received letters or petitions requesting commission review of the adjustment signed by at least five hundred (500) subscribers or five percent (5%) of subscribers, whichever is greater, the commission shall immediately notify the small telephone utility of this fact, and the proposed rate adjustment shall not become effective as scheduled. The small telepho ne utility may withdraw the proposed rate or charge adjustment, or if it decides to proceed, the commission shall review the proposed rate adjustment as though no election had been made pursuant to subsection (7) of this section. (4) Any other provision of this chapter notwithstanding, a small telephone utility which has elected to be regulated pursuant to this section may adjust any of its rates, charges, or tariffs, except for: (a) Its basic business rate; (b) Its basic residential rate; (c) Its zone charges; (d) Its installation charges for basic business or basic residential services; (e) Its access charges; or (f) Its pic charges, without regard to the effect on its revenues, by filing its proposed rates, charges, or tariffs with the commission and by notifying its subscribers, both at least thirty (30) calendar days prior to the effective date of its proposed rates, charges, or tariffs. (5) A small telephone utility which has elected to be regulated pursuant to this section shall not: (a) Adjust its intrastate access charges if the adjustment requires the small telephone utility's access charge customers, including interexchange carriers, to pay intrastate access charges at levels exceeding the small telephone utility's interstate access charge levels; or (b) Adjust its intrastate pic charges if the adjustment requires the small telephone utility's customers to pay intrastate pic charges at levels exceeding the small telephone utility's interstate pic charge levels.

Adjustments to intrastate access charge rates or intrastate pic charges shall be effective thirty (30) calendar days following the filing of access charge tariffs or pic charge tariffs with the commission. (6) The rates, charges, earnings, or revenues of a small telephone utility which has elected to be regulated pursuant to this section and is in compliance with the provisions of this section shall b e deemed by the commission to be in compliance with KRS 278.030(1). (7) A small telephone utility may elect, at any time, to be regulated by the provisions, in their entirety only, of this section by filing a verified resolution of the utility's board of directors, or other governing body, so electing with the commission. An election shall be effective immediately upon filing with the commission and shall remain effective until withdrawn by the filing with the commission of a verified resolution of the sm all telephone utility's board of directors or other governing body; provided, however, that all resolutions of election or withdrawal shall remain in effect for at least one (1) year from the date of their filing with the commission. A resolution electing to be regulated by the provisions of this section shall mean that the small telephone utility so electing shall be regulated by this section and shall not be regulated by KRS 278.020(1) and 278.300. Nothing in this section, however, shall be construed to alter the applicability of KRS 278.020 (4)[(3)] or 278.030(2) to small telephone utilities electing to be regulated by the provisions of this section. (8) A small telephone utility which has elected to be regulated pursuant to this section may file an application with the commission pursuant to KRS 278.020(1), and, if a utility does so, that application shall be deemed to have been granted unless within thirty (30) calendar days following the filing of the application, the commission denies the application. If the application is denied or none is filed, the small telephone utility electing to be regulated pursuant to this section may engage in the construction of the plant or facilities, or the purchase of 282 ACTS OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY equipment or properties, to provide the services described in KRS 278.010(3)(e). However, if the small telephone utility subsequently files a resolution of withdrawal under subsection (7) of this section, the increased value of property that resulted from any construction project denied approval by the comm ission or not submitted to the commission for approval may be excluded from the small utility's rate base for rate making purposes if the cost of construction exceeded one million dollars ($1,000,000) or five percent (5%) of the value of the small telephone utility's property as reflected in the utility's most recent annual report filed with the commission.

The terms of the contract shall specify the duties to be undertaken by the county attorney. These duties shall include but are not limited to the following actions: (a) Within fifty (50) days after the issuance of a certificate of delinquency to the state, county, and taxing district, the county attorney or the Revenue Cabinet shall cause a notice of the purchase to be mailed by regular mail to the property owner at the address on the records of the property valuation administrator.

This fee shall be added to the amount of the tax claims and paid by the persons paying the tax claims. They shall not be paid by the taxing districts or deducted from the taxes due the taxing distric ts. This fee shall be waived if the certificate of delinquency is paid by the taxpayer only within five (5) days of the sheriff's sale. If more than one (1) county attorney renders necessary services in an effort to collect a tax claim, the attorney serving the last notice or rendering the last substantial service preceding collection shall be entitled to the fee. When the county attorney's office, in an effort to collect a certificate of delinquency, or delinquent personal property tax bills files a court action which is litigated by the taxpayer, an additional county's attorney fee equal to thirteen percent (13%) of the total tax plus ten percent (10%) penalty, may be added to the certificate or the bill and shall become part of the tax claim. (5) If a county attorney chooses not to contract for these collection duties or if a county attorney fails to perform the duties required by the contract, the cabinet shall assume responsibility for the collection process. In the performance of those duties, the cabi net shall have all the powers, rights, duties, and authority with respect to the collection, refund, and administration of the amount due on the certificate of delinquency conferred generally upon the cabinet by Kentucky Revised Statutes including, but not limited to, KRS Chapters 131, 134, and 135.

A copy of the judgment shall also be sent to the cabinet. If the cabine t sends assistance to a county attorney who contracts to prosecute the suits or proceedings, the county attorney shall be entitled to his or her full fee. On the same day that suit is filed, the county clerk shall be given notice of its filing. Costs incident to the suit shall become a part of the tax claim. (7) The cabinet may make its delinquent tax collection databases and other technical resources, including but not limited to income tax refund offsetting, available to the county attorney upon request from the county attorney. CHAPTER 104 357 Legislative Research Commission PDF Version The county attorney seeking assistance shall enter into any agreements required by the cabinet to protect taxpayer confidentiality, to ensure database integrity, or to address other concerns of the cabinet. (8) The county attorney may, at any time after assuming collection duties, enter into an agreement with the delinquent taxpayer to accept installment payments on the delinquent tax bill.

Any county attorney desiring to perform the duties associated with the collection of delinquent tax claims shall enter into a contract with the cabinet on an annual basis. The terms of the contract shall specify the duties to be undertaken by the county attorney. These duties shal l include but are not limited to the following actions: (a) Within fifty (50) days after the issuance of a certificate of delinquency to the state, county, and taxing district, the county attorney or the Revenue Cabinet shall cause a notice of the purchase to be mailed by regular mail to the property owner at the address on the records of the property valuation administrator. The notice shall advise the owner that the certificate is a lien of record against all property of the owner, and bears interest at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum, and if not paid will be subject to collection by the county attorney as provided by law.

The postal cost of mailing the notices shall be added to the certificate of delinquency and, upon collection, t he county attorney shall be reimbursed for the postage.

This fee shall be added to the amount of the tax claims and paid by the persons paying the tax claims. They shall not be paid by the taxing districts or deducted from the taxes due the taxing districts. This fee shall be waived if the certificate of delinquency is paid by the taxpayer only within five (5) days of the sheriff's sale. If more than one (1) county attorney renders necessary services in an effort to collect a tax claim, the attorney serving the last notice or rendering the last substantial service preceding collection shall be entitled to the fee. When the county attorney's office, in an effort to collect a certificate of delinquency, or delinquent personal property tax bills files a court action which is litigated by the taxpayer, an additional county's attorne y fee equal to thirteen percent (13%) of the total tax plus ten percent (10%) penalty, may be added to the certificate or the bill and shall become part of the tax claim. (5) If a county attorney chooses not to contract for these collection duties or if a county attorney fails to perform the duties required by the contract, the cabinet shall assume responsibility for the collection process. In the performance of those duties, the cabinet shall have all the powers, rights, duties, and authority with respect to the collection, refund, and administration of the amount due on the certificate of delinquency conferred generally upon the cabinet by Kentucky Revised Statutes including, but not limited to, KRS Chapters 131, 134, and 135. The twenty percent (20%) fee that would have otherwise been paid to the county attorney shall be paid to the cabinet for deposit in the delinquent tax fund provided for under KRS 134.400.

The cabinet shall advise the county attorney in all actions, and may send him special assistance when the secretary deems assistance necessary. A copy of the judgment shall also be sent to the cabinet. If the cabinet sends assistance to a county attorney who contracts to prosecute the suits or proceedings, the county attorney shall be entitled to his full fee. On the same day that suit is filed, the county clerk shall be given notice of its filing. Costs incident to the suit shall become a part of the tax claim. (7) The cabinet may make its delinquent tax collection databases and other technical resources, including but not limited to income tax refund offsetting, available to the county attorney upon request from the county attorney. The county attorney seeking assistance shall enter into any a greements required by the cabinet to protect taxpayer confidentiality, to ensure database integrity, or to address other concerns of the cabinet. (8) The county attorney may, at any time after assuming collection duties, enter into an agreement with the delinquent taxpayer to accept installment payments on the delinquent tax bill. The agreement shall not waive the county attorney's right to initiate court action or other authorized collection activities if the taxpayer does not make payments in accordance with the agreement.

[ Two percent (2%) of the required payment shall be allocated to the medical insurance fund.] These contributions shall not be picked up, as described i n KRS 161.540(2). In purchasing retirement credit for active duty in the armed services, the latest years of service shall be considered first in allowing credit toward retirement.

The payments shall not be picked up as described in KRS 161.540(2). For each year of which the retirement system shall accept CHAPTER 121 463 Legislative Research Commission PDF Version the contribution and interest, one (1) year of service credit shall be given. This credit may not be used to meet the service requirements of KRS 161.525, 161.600, or 161.661, except as provided in subsection (2)(c) of this section. No credit shall be granted for service which has been or will be used in qualifying for annuity benefit payments from another retirement system financed wholly or in part by public funds; (b) A member of the retirement system having teaching service in the elementary or secondary schools operated by the United States overseas or in this country, or in a public college or university in Kentucky, not included in the Teachers' Retirement System of the State of Kentucky, may present this service for credit in the retirement system on the same basis as provided above for out -of-state service credit; however, no service may be presented which shall be used as a basis for retirement benefits in any program supported wholly or in part by a public institution or governmental agency.

In exercising this right, the surviving widow or widower shall be entitled to receive a n annuity for life, except as provided in subsection (6) of this section. This subsection applies to surviving spouses of members who die on or after July 1, 1978.

(2) Where there are surviving unmarried children under age eighteen (18) or under age nineteen (19) if a full -time student in high school, the benefit shall be two hundred dollars ($200) per month in the case of one (1) child, 464 ACTS OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY three hundred forty dollars ($340) per month in the case of two (2) children, four hundred dollars ($400) per month in the case of three (3) children, and four hundred forty dollars ($440) per month in the case of four (4) or more children. Benefits under this subsection shall apply in addition to benefits which may be payable under subsections (1) and (3) of this section. (3) Where the survivor is a chi ld age eighteen (18) or older whose mental or physical condition is sufficient to cause his dependency on the deceased member at the time of the member's death, the benefit shall be two hundred dollars ($200) per month, payable for the life of the child or until the time as the mental or physical condition creating the dependency no longer exists or the child marries. Benefits under this subsection and subsection (2) of this section shall apply to legally adopted survivors provided the proceedings for the a doption were initiated at least one (1) year prior to the death of the member. The mental or physical condition of the adult child shall be revealed by a competent examination by a licensed physician and shall be approved by a majority of a medical review committee as defined in KRS 161.661(13).

The board of trustees may subpoena records and individuals whenever it deems this action necessary. (8) No payment of benefits shall be made unless the board of trustees authorizes the payment. The board shall promulgate administrative regulations for the administration of the provisions in this section and in every case the decision of the board of trustees shall be final as to eligibility, dependency, or disability, and the amount of benefits payable. (9) In the event that ther e are no eligible survivors as defined in subsections (1) to (5) of this section, the board of trustees shall pay to the estate or assigns of the deceased member a refund of his accumulated contributions as provided in KRS 161.470(7). If the benefits paid or payable under subsections (1) to (5) of this section and KRS 161.661 shall amount to a sum less than the member's accumulated contributions at the time of death, the board of trustees shall pay to the estate or assigns of the deceased member the balance of the accumulated contributions. (10) Any person who is receiving benefits and becomes disqualified from receiving those benefits under this section shall immediately notify the Teachers' Retirement System of this disqualification in writing and shall return all benefits paid after the date of disqualification. Failure to comply with these provisions shall create an indebtedness of that person to the Teachers' Retirement System. Interest at the rate of eight percent (8%) per annum shall be charged if the debt is not repaid within sixty (60) days after the date of disqualification. Failure to repay this debt creates a lien in favor of the Teachers' Retirement System upon all property of the person who improperly receives benefits and does not repay those benefits. Section 10.

Under the provisions of KRS 61.680, benefits shal l be processed as if the member retired for service. In exercising this right the spouse or legal dependent shall be limited to selecting an option providing either a straight life annuity with refundable balance or a term certain option. A spouse may receive the annuity provided by this section at the same time as children are qualifying for survivors' benefits under the provisions of KRS 161.520; however, a legal dependent, other than a spouse, may not receive these payments if children have qualified for benefits under that section. (2) A spouse [ or legal dependent] qualifying for an annuity under subsection (1) of this section may defer the payments in order to reduce the actuarial discounts to be applied due to age. (3) Upon death of a member in active contributing status at the time of his death, who had a minimum of twenty - seven (27) years of service, the spouse, if named as the primary beneficiary of the member's account shall be entitled to a monthly minimum allowance of three hundred dollars ($300 ) as the basic straight life annuity.

(4) Under this section, an employer may employ full -time a number of retired members not to exceed three percent (3%) [four percent (4%)] of the membership actively employed full -time by that employer. The board of trustees may reduce this three percent (3%) [four percent (4%)] cap upon recommendation of the retirement system's actuary if a reduction is necessary to maintain the actuarial soundness of the retirement system. The board of trustees may increase the three percent (3%) [four percent (4%)] cap upon a determination that an increase is warranted to help address a shortage in the number of available tea chers and upon the determination of the retirement system's actuary that the proposed cap increase allows the actuarial soundness of the retirement system to be maintained.

Each annu al adjustment shall become part of the member's daily rate base. Failure to comply with the salary limitations set forth in subsections (1) and (2) of this section as may be adjusted by this subsection shall result in a reduction of the member's retirement allowance or any other benefit to which the member would otherwise be entitled on a dollar -for-dollar basis for each dollar that the member exceeds these salary limitations.

Such payments shall be made directly to the ceding insurer or to its domiciliary liquidator except: CHAPTER 125 487 Legislative Research Commission PDF Version 1.

Section 3. KRS 304.33 -350 is amended to read as follows: The amount recoverable by the liquidator from a reinsurer shall not be reduced a s a result of delinquency proceedings unless the reinsurance contract provides, in substance, that in the event of the insolvency of the ceding insurer the reinsurance shall be payable under a contract reinsured by the assuming insurer on the basis of reported claims allowed by the liquidation court, without diminution because of the insolvency of the ceding insurer. Such payments shall be made directly to the ceding insurer or to its domiciliary liquidator, except: (1) Where the contract or other written agreement specifically provides another payee of such reinsurance in the event of the insolvency of the ceding insurer; or 488 ACTS OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY (2) Where the assuming insurer, with the consent of the direct insured, has assumed such policy obligations of the ceding insurer as direct obligations of the assuming insurer to the payees under such policies and in substitution for the obligations of the ceding insurer to such payees [, regardless of any provision in the reinsurance contract or other agreement. Payment made directly t o an insured or other creditor shall not diminish the reinsurer's obligation to the insurer's estate except when the reinsurance contract provided for direct coverage of an individual named insured and the payment was made in discharge of that obligation] . Section 4. KRS 304.33 -380 is amended to read as follows: (1) Claims contingent on judgments. The claim of a third party which is contingent only on his first obtaining a judgment against the insured shall be considered and allowed as if there were no such contingency. (2) Claims under terminated policies. Any claim that would have become absolute if there had been no termination of coverage under KRS 304.33 -120, and which was not covered by insurance acquired to replace the terminated coverage, shall be allowed as if the coverage had remained in effect, unless at least ten (10) days before the insured event occurred either the claimant had actual notice of the termination or notice was mailed to him as prescribed by subsection (1) of KRS 304.33 -250, or subsection (1) of KRS 304.33 -260. If allowed, the claim shall share in distributions under subsection (9) of KRS 304.33 -430. (3) Other contingent claims. A claim may be allowed even if contingent, if it is filed in accordance with subsection (2) of KRS 304.33 -360. It may be allowed and may participate in all dividends declared after it is filed, to the extent that it does not prejudice the orderly administration of the liquidation. (4) Immature claims. Claims that are due except for the passage of time s hall be treated as absolute claims are treated, except that where justice requires the court may order them discounted at the legal rate of interest. (5) (a) Nothing in this section or any other section in this subtitle shall be construed as authorizing the receiver, or any other entity, to compel payment from a reinsurer on the basis of estimated incurred but not reported losses or outstanding reserves.

For Agricultural Credit Associations chartered by the Farm Credit Administration, capital shall be co mputed by deducting the book value of the association's investment in any other wholly owned institution chartered by the Farm Credit Administration that is either subject to the tax imposed by KRS 136.300 or Section 6 of this Act or that is exempt from state taxation by federal law. The cabinet shall immediately notify each institution of the value so fixed. Section 6.

A NEW SECTION OF KRS CHAPTER 386 IS CREATED TO READ AS FOLLOWS: After a decedent dies, in the case of an estate, or after an i ncome interest in a trust ends, the following rules apply. (1) A fiduciary of an estate or of a terminating income interest shall determine the amount of net income and net principal receipts received from property specifically given to a beneficiary under the rules in Articles 3, 4, and 5 of the Kentucky Principal and Income Act that apply to trustees and the rules in subsection (5) of this section. The fiduciary shall distribute the net income and net principal receipts to the beneficiary who is to recei ve the specific property. (2) A fiduciary shall determine the remaining net income of a decedent's estate or a terminating income interest under the rules in Articles 3, 4, and 5 of the Kentucky Principal and Income Act that apply to trustees and by: (a) Including in net income all income from property used to discharge liabilities; (b) Paying from income or principal, in the fiduciary's discretion, fees to attorneys, accountants, and fiduciaries; court costs and other expenses of administration; and int erest on death taxes, but the fiduciary may pay those expenses from income of property passing to a trust for which the fiduciary claims an estate tax marital or charitable deduction only to the extent that the payment of those expenses from income will not cause the reduction or loss of the deduction; and (c) Paying from principal all other disbursements made or incurred in connection with the settlement of a decedent's estate or the winding up of a terminating income interest, including debts, funeral expenses, disposition of remains, family allowances, and death taxes and related penalties that are apportioned to the estate or terminating income interest by the will, the terms of the trust, or applicable law. (3) A fiduciary shall distribute to a beneficiary who receives a pecuniary amount outright the interest or any other amount provided by the will, the terms of the trust, or applicable law from net income determined under subsection (2) of this section, or from principal to the extent that net income is insufficient. If a beneficiary is to receive a pecuniary amount outright from a trust after an income interest ends and no interest or other amount is provided for by the terms of the trust or applicable law, the fiduciary shall distribute the interest or other amount to which the beneficiary would be entitled under applicable law if the pecuniary amount were required to be paid under a will. (4) A fiduciary shall distribute the net income remaining after distributions required by subsection (3) of thi s section in the manner described in Section 5 of this Act to all other beneficiaries, including a beneficiary who receives a pecuniary amount in trust, even if the beneficiary holds an unqualified power to withdraw assets from the trust or other presently exercisable general power of appointment over the trust. (5) A fiduciary shall not reduce principal or income receipts from property described in subsection (1) of this section because of a payment described in Section 21 of this Act to the extent that t he will, the terms of the trust, or applicable law requires the fiduciary to make the payment from assets other than the property or to the extent that the fiduciary recovers or expects to recover the payment from a third party. The net income and principal receipts from the property are determined by including all of the amounts the fiduciary CHAPTER 158 581 Legislative Research Commission PDF Version receives or pays with respect to the property, whether those amounts accrued or became due before, on, or after the date of a decedent's death or an income interest's terminating event, and by making a reasonable provision for amounts that the fiduciary believes the estate or terminating income interest may become obligated to pay after the property is distributed. SECTION 5. A NEW SECTION OF KRS CHAPTER 386 IS CREATED TO READ AS FOLLOWS: (1) Each beneficiary described in subsection (4) of Section 4 of this Act is entitled to receive a portion of the net income equal to the beneficiary's fractional interest in undistributed principal assets, using values as of the distribution date. If a fiduciary makes more than one (1) distribution of assets to beneficiaries to whom this section applies, each beneficiary, including one (1) who shall not receive part of the distribution, is entitled, as of each distribution date, to the net income the fiduciary has received after the date of the death or terminating event or earlier distribution date but has not distributed as of the current distribution date. (2) In determining a beneficiary's share of net income, the following rul es apply. (a) The beneficiary is entitled to receive a portion of the net income equal to the beneficiary's fractional interest in the undistributed principal assets immediately before the distribution date, including assets that later may be sold to meet principal obligations. (b) The beneficiary's fractional interest in the undistributed principal assets shall be calculated without regard to property specifically given to a beneficiary and property required to pay pecuniary amounts not in trust. (c) The beneficiary's fractional interest in the undistributed principal assets shall be calculated on the basis of the aggregate value of those assets as of the distribution date without reducing the value by an unpaid principal obligation. (d) The distribution date for purposes of this section may be the date as of which the fiduciary calculates the value of the assets if that date is reasonably near the date on which assets are actually distributed. (3) If a fiduciary does not distribute all of the collected but undistributed net income to each person as of a distribution date, the fiduciary shall maintain appropriate records showing the interest of each beneficiary in that net income. (4) A fiduciary may apply the rules in this section, to the extent that the fiduciary considers it appropriate, to net gain or loss realized after the date of death or terminating event or earlier distribution date from the disposition of a principal asset if this section applies to the income from the asset. ARTICLE 3 APPORT IONMENT AT BEGINNING AND END OF INCOME INTEREST SECTION 6. A NEW SECTION OF KRS CHAPTER 386 IS CREATED TO READ AS FOLLOWS: (1) An income beneficiary is entitled to net income from the date on which the income interest begins. An income interest begins on the date specified in the terms of the trust or, if no date is specified, on the date an asset becomes subject to a trust or successive income interest. (2) An asset becomes subject to a trust: (a) On the date it is transferred to the trust in the ca se of an asset that is transferred to a trust during the transferor's life; (b) On the date of a testator's death in the case of an asset that becomes subject to a trust by reason of a will, even if there is an intervening period of administration of the testator's estate; or (c) On the date of an individual's death in the case of an asset that is transferred to a fiduciary by a third party because of the individual's death.

SECTION 7. A NEW SECTION OF KRS CHAPTER 386 IS CREATED TO READ AS FOLLOWS: (1) A trustee shall allocate an income receipt or disbursement other than one to which subsection (1) of Section 4 of this Act applies to principal if its due date occurs before a decedent dies in the case of an estate or before an income interest begins in the case of a trust or successive income interest. (2) A trustee shall allocate an income receipt or disbursement to income if its due date occurs on or after the date on which a decedent dies or an income interest begins and it is a periodic due date. An income receipt or disburs ement shall be treated as accruing from day to day if its due date is not periodic or it has no due date. The portion of the receipt or disbursement accruing before the date on which a decedent dies or an income interest begins shall be allocated to principal and the balance shall be allocated to income. (3) An item of income or an obligation is due on the date the payer is required to make a payment. If a payment date is not stated, there is no due date for the purposes of Sections 1 to 27 of this Act. Di stributions to shareholders or other owners from an entity to which Section 9 of this Act applies are deemed to be due on the date fixed by the entity for determining who is entitled to receive the distribution or, if no date is fixed, on the declaration date for the distribution. A due date is periodic for receipts or disbursements that shall be paid at regular intervals under a lease or an obligation to pay interest or if an entity customarily makes distributions at regular intervals.

Approximately 240,000 recipients in the outpatient pharmacy program take eight or more prescription med ications each month, and national studies suggest that persons taking eight or more prescription medications each month are more likely to have an adverse reaction; and WHEREAS, the use of reliable and complete data will provide the department with information necessary to analyze and modernize the Medicaid program while also improving the quality of care and reducing risks associated with inappropriate care; and WHEREAS, the Governor's Office and cabinet departments associated with management of the Medi caid program have a critical need to upgrade the program's administrative capabilities consistent with other states' Medicaid programs and consistent with the Commonwealth's commercial health care market; NOW, THEREFORE, Be it resolved by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky: Section 1. The Kentucky Medicaid program shall embark on an omnibus plan to modernize Medicaid through improvements in technology, advanced medical management initiatives, and improved benefit management approaches .

This integral component of Medicaid modernization may include a review of the program's claims processing, eligibility management, and reporting capabilities both internally and through contracted agents; and (2) Create a data warehouse to capture demographic and utilization data on the full spectrum of the Medicaid program. The data warehouse may allow for the accurate and timely retrieval of data in a readily accessible format. The data may be utilized to track programmatic trends and monitor the progress of new initiatives. Section 3. To improve care management, the Department for Medicaid Se rvices may: (1) Institute a disease management initiative. This initiative may contain the following components: (a) Member education. Member education may provide for instruction to Medicaid recipients about the causes and triggers of the medical conditions that are targeted by the initiative and the available treatment options for the conditions. Education may assist recipients with information about appropriate access of the health care system and identifying alternatives to emergency room care for non emergency conditions; and (b) Case management. Case management may involve the use of a team of medical professionals who may answer questions, give information, and offer medical advice; (2) Institute a self -directed care initiative. This initiative may combine educational and delivery system approaches to create consumer -driven health care, including but not limited to Cash and Counseling, that empowers the Medicaid recipient to be an informed participant in the dollar distribution of his or her care ma nagement by making more care decisions, thereby facilitating improved accountability and quality of care; and CHAPTER 181 635 Legislative Research Commission PDF Version (3) Institute a utilization management initiative. This initiative may include a review of the department's utilization review processes to determine whether they conform to industry standards and are the most cost -effective means of achieving those standards. The review may include an analysis and update to any contract with a peer review organization, with the goal of implementing utilization rev iew approaches that are consistent with industry standards. Section 4. To improve benefit management, the Department for Medicaid Services may: (1) Institute pharmacy benefit management. This initiative may include the selection of a pharmacy benefit management firm and implementation of a pharmacy benefit management program to ensure appropriate oversight, appropriate pharmacy usage levels, management, and reporting within the outpatient pharmacy program; and (2) Empower the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Advisory Committee. This committee, which assists the department with decisions about appropriate utilization and authorization requirements of prescription medications in the outpatient pharmacy program, may be given increased responsibility with management of the preferred drug list; and (3) Secure supplemental rebates. The department may work with the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Advisory Committee and a pharmacy benefit management firm to develop systems to allow the department to secure additional financ ial rebates from pharmaceutical manufacturers.

(2) Interstate wagers at a receiving track may form an interstate common wagering pool with wagers at a track in another jurisdiction, and the receiving track may adopt the commission and breakage rates of the track at which the race is being run. The authority [commission] may also approve types of wagering, distribution of winnings, and rules of racing for interstate common wagering pools that are different from those that normally apply in Kentucky. (3) Wagers placed on any races run at track in Kentucky may be combined with wagers placed at tracks in other jurisdictions to form an interstate common wagering pool l ocated either within or outside Kentucky.
