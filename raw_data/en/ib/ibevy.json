Hyman, MD, FAAP ,aSusan E. Levy, MD, MPH, FAAP ,bScott M. Myers, MD, FAAP ,cCOUNCIL ON CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES, SECTION ON DEVELOPMENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL PEDIATRICS abstract Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder with reported prevalence in the United States of 1 in 59 children (approximately 1.7%). Core de cits are identi ed in 2 domains: social communication/interaction and restrictive, repetitive patterns of behavior.Children and youth with ASD have service needs in behavioral, educational, health, leisure, family support, and other areas. Standardized screening for ASD at 18 and 24 months of age with ongoing developmental surveillance continues to be recommended in primary care (although it may be performed in other settings), because ASD is common, can be diagnosed as young as 18 months of age, and has evidenced-based interventions that may improvefunction. More accurate and culturally sensitive screening approaches are needed. Primary care providers should be familiar with the diagnostic criteria for ASD, appropriate etiologic evaluation, and co-occurring medical and behavioral conditions (such as disorders of sleep and feeding, gastrointestinal tract symptoms, obesity, seizures, attention-de cit/hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, and wandering) that affect the child 's function and quality of life. There is an increasing evidence base to support behavioral and other interventions to address speci c skills and symptoms. Shared decision making calls for collaboration with families in evaluation and choice of interventions. Thissingle clinical report updates the 2007 American Academy of Pediatrics clinical reports on the evaluation and treatment of ASD in one publication withan online table of contents and section view available through the American Academy of Pediatrics Gateway to help the reader identify topic areas within the report.

Direct and indirect costs of caring for children and adults withASD in the United States in 2015 were estimated to be $268 billion, more than the cost of stroke and hypertension combined. 3The lifetime cost of education, health, and other service needs for an individual with ASD ranges from $1.4 to $2.4 million dollars, depending on whether he or she has any co-occurring intellectual disabilities.4To deliver timely and effective medical, behavioral, educational, and social services across the lifespan means that primary care providers must understand the needs of individualswith ASD and their families. ASD is more commonly diagnosed now than in the past, and the signi cant health, educational, and social needs ofindividuals with ASD and theirfamilies constitute an area of critical need for resources, research, and professional education. In the 12 years since the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)published the clinical report\"Identi cation and Evaluation of Children With Autism SpectrumDisorders\" 5and its companion, \"Management of Children With Autism Spectrum Disorders, \"6 reported prevalence rates of ASD in children have increased, understanding of potential risk factors has expanded, awareness of co-occurring medical conditions andgenetic contribution to etiology has improved, and the body of research supporting evidence-based interventions has grown substantially. This updated clinical report builds onprevious reports and guidance for care of children and youth with ASD. It also re flects changes in diagnosticcriteria after publication of theDiagnostic and Statistical Manual ofMental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM- 5) 1in 2013. The DSM-5 established a single category of ASD to replace the subtypes of autistic disorder, Asperger syndrome, and pervasivedevelopmental disorder nototherwise speci ed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of MentalDisorders, Fourth Edition, TextRevision (DSM-IV-TR). With the current reported prevalence rate of 1: 59 children (approximately 1.7%), all primary care providers can expect tohave children and youth with ASD intheir practices. 2As noted in earlier clinical reports, the primary careprovider has critical access to thechild in the context of the medicalhome to identify symptoms of ASD early in childhood, support the family through the process of diagnosis andintervention, address etiologicevaluations, help the familyunderstand how to interpret theevidence supporting differentinterventions so they can effectivelyengage in shared decision-making, and manage co-occurring medical conditions that may in fluence outcome and affect daily function.The primary care provider can helpminimize disparities in age ofdiagnosis of African American andHispanic children and be alert to thepotential for gender bias in symptom recognition. 7This updated document aims to provide primary care providers with a summary of currentinformation in a single report thatwill help guide them in providinga medical home for the patientwith ASD. SECTION 1: PREVALENCE Incidence is the onset of newdiagnoses over time in a selectedcohort. Without consistentlongitudinal data in a speci ed cohort, incidence cannot bedetermined. Because of the heterogeneity of symptoms and severity in ASD, it may be diagnosedin children at different ages. What isreported is age at recognition ofsymptoms, not the actual onset. Asa result, prevalence is more typicallyreported than incidence, re flecting rates of ASD in the population ata point in time. The reported prevalence of children with ASD has increased over time, and primary care providers are oftenasked about the reasons for thisincrease. This increase may beattributable to several factors,including broadening in thediagnostic criteria with ongoingrevisions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders(DSM), the more inclusive de nition of pervasive developmental disorderwith the adoption of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of MentalDisorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) in 1994, 8increased public awareness of the disorder and its symptoms, recommendations for universal screening for ASD,5,9and increased availability of early intervention andschool-based services for childrenwith ASD. In part, the increasingnumbers of children with a diagnosisof ASD may re flect diagnostic substitution, the recognition of ASD in children previously primarily diagnosed with intellectual disabilityor a co-occurring genetic syndrome. 10 A true increase in the prevalence ofASD associated with other biologicalrisk factors is also possible. Prevalence rates in US populations are similar to those of otherindustrialized countries, 11and lower rates are reported in resource-limitedcountries, where epidemiological dataare more dif cult to collect. 12Data on national samples suggest that theprevalence of ASD is stabilizing. 2,13 Ongoing epidemiological studies helpto understand changes in thereported prevalence over time.Epidemiological data help to predictthe need for services and identifypotential risk factors. Surveillance methods include regional, state, and/or national registry systems; 2 FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS by guest on August 26, 2021 www.aappublications.org/news Downloaded from records- or services-based analyses; surveys; and other methods, includingpopulation-based case ndings. In 2000, the US Centers for DiseaseControl and Prevention (CDC)established the Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) Network as a population-based public health surveillance system to estimate theprevalence of ASD in children 8 years of age. ADDM reports published in 2014 and 2016 revealed comparable prevalence rates (approximately 1 in 68), 14,15but the report published in 20182revealed a slightly increased rate (1 in 59). Additional data overtime will help determine if rates have stabilized. The data also revealed some variation in prevalence rates across the participating states, with the highest rates in the locationswhere both educational and health records were available for chart abstraction and standardized application of diagnostic criteria. Regional variation in prevalence mayalso re flect availability of services, local provider practices for ASDscreening, educational policies, school and/or community resources, and insurance mandates, among other factors. The CDC also published data on the prevalence of ASD in childrenwho were 4 years of age in 2010. A lower prevalence rate for diagnosis (1.34%) was reported in these children (approximately 30% less than that of children 8 years of age).The lower identi ed prevalence and higher proportional rate of children4 years of age with ASD and intellectual disabilities may be attributable, in part, to later diagnosisof children with ASD and average- range cognitive abilities. 16The National Survey of Children 's Health (2011 -2012) and the National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs (2009 -2010) were analyzed for the age the parents reporteddiagnosis as well as for parent- reported subjective severity. The minority of children were identi edas having ASD before 3 years of age.Diagnosis later than 6 years of agewas reported in one-third to half ofchildren. Later age at diagnosis wasassociated with reported mild presentation. 16 CDC surveillance data published in 2014 revealed that white, non- Hispanic children were approximately 20% more likely to be identi ed with ASD before the case review than werenon-Hispanic African Americanchildren and were about 50% morelikely to be identi ed with ASD than were Hispanic children. 14Recent prevalence data reveal increasing rates of ASD in Hispanic and African American children. This may re flect more widespread awareness of thesymptoms among parents, schools,and health care providers andimproved rates of screening in healthsupervision care. 2Studies examining the effects of race and ethnicity on age at diagnosis are con flicting,7but earlier diagnosis of ASD is associated with higher socioeconomic status andaccess to services. African Americanand Hispanic children diagnosed withASD by age 4 years were more likelyto have coexisting intellectualdisability than were white, non- Hispanic children, suggesting that some African American and Hispanicchildren with ASD and average toabove-average intelligence may nothave been identi ed. 17 SECTION 2: CLINICAL SYMPTOMS Despite advances in understandingthe neurobiology and genetics of ASD,the diagnosis of ASD continues to bebased on identifying and reporting behaviorally de ned clinical symptoms. The challenges in determining accurate prevalencerates, in part, relate to the need forconsistency in clinical diagnosis ofa very heterogeneous disorder. In2013, the DSM-5 consolidated thediagnosis of ASD into a single category and emphasized the importance of identifying coexistingdevelopmental and behavioraldisorders and symptoms. In the years since the 2007 AAP clinical reports on ASD, both professional education and public awareness have promoted recognition of symptoms that might lead to early identi cation of ASD, use of standardized screening approaches, and management of associated medical and behavioral features of ASD from infancy through adolescence. Core Symptoms Although symptoms of ASD are neurologically based, they manifest as behavioral characteristics that present differently depending on age, language level, and cognitive abilities. Core symptoms cluster in 2 domains (social communication/interaction and restricted, repetitive patterns ofbehavior), as described in the DSM- 5. 1Atypical development in several functional areas contribute to symptoms of ASD. Abnormalities in understanding the intent of others, diminished interactive eye contact, and atypical use and understandingof gesture presage atypical development of social communication and pretend play as well as interest in other children. Symptoms of ASD are further shaped by de cits in imitation and of processing information acrosssensory modalities, such as vision(gesture) and hearing (language). Repetitive behaviors and perseveration may be primary compulsions but may also be related to atypical processing of sensory information or may re flect a desire to instill predictability when an individual does not understand the intent of others. The CDC \"Learn the Signs. Act Early \"Web site provides free resources to help families recognize developmental concerns,including autism (https://www.cdc. gov/ncbddd/actearly/), and Autism Navigator (www.autismnavigator. com) has a video glossary of early symptoms in toddlers. PEDIATRICS Volume 145, number 1, January 2020 3 by guest on August 26, 2021 www.aappublications.org/news Downloaded from Approximately one-quarter of children with ASD will be reported tohave a regression in language orsocial skills, most typically between18 and 24 months of age. 18,19The reason for this loss of previouslyacquired milestones is not yet known. Although medical evaluation of loss of milestones is indicated, a history ofregression in language and socialinteraction in children with ASDwithin the expected age range is notlikely to be attributable to seizures orneurodegenerative disorders. Notethat the processes underlying regression are not yet well understood. Current theories includesynaptic \"over pruning \"in response to genetic factors. 20 Diagnostic Criteria: DSM-5 The DSM has been central inestablishing criteria for diagnosingmental and behavioral disorders. Thediagnosis of infantile autism wasintroduced in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,Third Edition nearly 30 years after therst edition of the DSM was published in 1952. The initialdescriptions were narrow andreferred to individuals with profoundimpairment. Publication of the DSM-IV in 1994 expanded the diagnosis toa spectrum of symptoms calledpervasive developmental disorders(PDDs), which included the diagnoses of autistic disorder, Asperger disorder, pervasive developmentaldisorder not otherwise speci ed (PDD-NOS), childhood disintegrativedisorder, and Rett disorder. The PDDsincluded individuals with lower- andhigher-functioning cognitive skills.PDD-NOS was a diagnostic category requiring some, but not all, of the core symptoms necessary for otherdiagnoses in this category.Subsequent research hasdemonstrated that the subgroupingswithin PDD were not reproducibleacross research sites by using thesame diagnostic data 21,22and were not stable over time. The overlapbetween DSM-IV -dened subgroupspaired with inconsistency in theirapplication across research sitessupports the decision to consolidate the subgroups into 1 diagnostic category, ASD, in the DSM-5. TheDSM-IV divided the symptoms of ASD into 3 areas: qualitative impairment of social reciprocity, qualitative impairment of communication, and restricted and repetitive behaviors. Inthe DSM-5, core symptoms were divided into 2 domains (social communication and social interaction and restrictive, repetitive patterns of behaviors). 23To ful ll diagnostic criteria for ASD by using the DSM-5, all 3 symptoms of social affective difference need to be present in addition to 2 of 4 symptoms related to restrictive and repetitivebehaviors. Examples in Table 1 are illustrative but not exhaustive. The recognition of symptoms of ASD related to sensory processing led to the inclusion of sensory symptoms,such as hyper- or hyporeactivity to sensory input or unusual interests in sensory aspects of the environment. Examples include apparent indifference to pain or temperature;sensitivity to sound, taste, or textures; and intense visual interest in objects or movement. The DSM-5 notes that a diagnosis may be made at older ages, when the demands of the socialor school environment may result in functional impairment. Almost all individuals with a diagnosis of autistic disorder or Asperger syndrome by using DSM-IV criteria would be diagnosed with ASDby using DSM-5 criteria. 24To determine if the same patients wouldbe identi ed by the DSM-IV and DSM- 5 criteria, the CDC ADDM Networklooked at its chart abstraction data on8-year-old children. 25This analysis revealed that more than 80% ofchildren diagnosed with PDD-NOS would also be diagnosed with ASD. 25 It is possible that the narrative in the charts that were abstracted was influenced by knowledge of the DSM- IV criteria.26There is a high level ofagreement of surveillance data by using DSM-IV-TR and DSM-5 criteria. The DSM-5 criteria have been shown to appropriately identify youngerchildren and those with mildsymptoms. 25,27These children with milder cognitive and adaptivesymptoms may be the ones most likely to have signi cant change with early intervention services. The DSM-5 also introduced an approach to severity rating, which is summarized in Table 2. Severity rating re flects the impairment of the ASD symptoms and the resultantservice needs of the individual.Severity rating is not a quanti able score that can be used to monitorprogress at this time; in clinical use, itoften re flects the impact of cognitive limitations. 28Measures have been published that attempt to captureseverity of core symptoms 29,30and allow for measurement ofimprovement with intervention. 31To date, no single measure adequatelyreflects the combination of medical, behavioral, and educational severity in a fashion that will help clinicians and families determine progress withintervention across multiplefunctional domains. Coexistingmedical disorders also affect theperception of severity and theprognosis for children witha diagnosis of ASD. The DSM-5 includes course speci ers that help describe the variation in symptoms of individuals with ASD. Coursespeci ers include the presence or absence of intellectual impairment,language impairment, catatonia,medical conditions, and knowngenetic or environmental etiologic factors. Patients with Rett syndrome are no longer automaticallyconsidered to have a diagnosis of ASDaccording the DSM-5, althoughindividuals with this neurogeneticdisorder may also meet diagnosticcriteria for ASD. Speci c genetic causes of ASD should be recorded as speci ers for individuals with ASD when identi ed. The DSM-5 promotes 4 FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS by guest on August 26, 2021 www.aappublications.org/news Downloaded from notation of all coexisting diagnoses as speci ers. Social pragmatic communicationdisorder is a new diagnosis described within the DSM-5 that describes individuals who exhibit functionallyimpairing symptoms in sociallanguage use but do not have habitual or repetitive behaviors. 1Individuals who are affected must have de cits in using language for social purposes, impaired ability to match their communication style with the context for communication, dif culty following the conventional rules forconversation, and dif culty with idioms and unstated meanings inlanguage (Table 3). As with ASD, thesymptoms cannot be better explained by another DSM-5 diagnosis. Research and experience with DSM-5diagnoses over time will giveclinicians a better sense of how ASDand social communication disorder are similar and different in terms of etiology, prognosis, and treatment. Evaluation of pragmatic (social) language use by a speech-languagepathologist provides additionalinformation to consider this diagnosis. 32The characteristics of social pragmatic communication disorder and how best to addresssymptoms require additional study. Although the DSM-5 provides the criteria and de nitions to accurately assign mental health and behavioral diagnoses, the International Classi cation of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modi cation is the standardized code set used forpayment as well as for statistical tracking through electronic medical records. The International Classi cation of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modi cationcontinues to include the subtypes of diagnoses as de ned by the DSM-IV. 33 The DSM-5 provides the clinician withcriteria and de nitions for diagnosis of ASD and should guide the clinicianin the diagnosis and management of ASD. Co-occurring Symptoms and Conditions Co-occurring conditions are common in children with ASD and may havegreat effects on child and familyfunctioning and clinical management (see also Section 5: Interventions). Examples include medical conditionssuch as sleep disorders and seizures;other developmental or behavioraldiagnoses, such attention-de cit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),anxiety, and mood disorders; andbehavioral disorders, such as food refusal, self-injury, and aggression. 34 Approximately 30% of children withTABLE 1 DSM-5 Criteria for Autism Spectrum Disorder Domains Criteria: De cits Examples A.

Hyper- or hyporeactivity to sensory input or unusual interests in sensory aspects of the environmentApparent indifference to pain/temperature, adverse response to speci c sounds or textures, excessive smelling or touching of objects, visual fascination with lights or movement Symptoms must be present in the early developmental period (but may not become fully manifest until social demands exceed limited capacities or may be masked by learned strategies in later life). Symptoms cause clinically signi cant impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of current functioning. These disturbances are not better explained by intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder) or global developmental delay. Intellectual disability and ASD frequently co-occur; to make comorbid diagnoses of ASD and intellectual disability, social communication should be below that expected for the general developmental level.

Prognosis The prognosis and trajectory of development for a young child diagnosed with ASD typically cannotbe predicted at the time of diagnosis.However, most children ( $80%) who are diagnosed with ASD aftera comprehensive evaluation at lessthan 3 years have retained theirdiagnosis. 36,37It may be more difcult to recognize mild symptoms of ASD in children younger than3 years of age, especially if they haveaverage or above-average cognitiveabilities. 38Across early childhood development, communication skills and social affective symptoms may improve, whereas repetitivebehaviors may change, possiblyreflecting maturation and/or intervention. 39In general, young children with ASD with languageimpairment appear to have moresocial dif culty than do children with ASD without language impairment.Children with ASD and intellectualdisability have the most dif culty developing social competence. 40The prognosis for children with ASD inphenotypic and demographicsubgroups (eg, girls, racial andethnic subgroups, children with macrocephaly) needs additional study.Approximately 9% of children whoare diagnosed with ASD in early childhood may not meet diagnosticcriteria for ASD by young adulthood.Youth who no longer meet criteria forASD are more likely to have a historyof higher cognitive skills at 2 years of age, to have participated in earlier intervention services, and to havedemonstrated a decrease in theirrepetitive behaviors over time. 41A change in clinical diagnosis (eg, toADHD or obsessive-compulsivedisorder [OCD]) is more likely inchildren who were diagnosed withASD before 30 months of age or hada diagnosis of PDD-NOS per the DSM-IV. 42,43Severity scores are most likely to improve in youth who have had thegreatest increase in tested verbalIQ. 44Executive function dif cultiesTABLE 2 ASD Symptoms by Level of Severity Severity Level Social Affective Restricted and Repetitive Behaviors Level 1. \"Requiring support \"Without supports in place, de cits in social communication cause noticeable impairments.

The screens are based on early manifestations of symptoms of core de cits related to social communication. Some of theseearly symptoms that may alert theprovider to the risk for ASD havebeen called \"redflags \"(Table 4). Developmental surveillance for ASDincludes asking caregivers aboutconcerns they have about their child 's development or behavior, informalobservation, and monitoring ofsymptoms in the context of routine health supervision. The \"Learn the Signs. Act Early \"parent resourcesdeveloped by the CDC may help educate families about developmentaland behavioral milestones (https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/actearly/index.html). Developmentalsurveillance alone is not suf cient to identify children who need furtherevaluation because children with ASDmay not demonstrate characteristicsymptoms in brief of ce visits, 50and caregivers may not volunteer socialand emotional concerns unlessspeci cally asked. Use of a standardized screening tool for ASD can help families identify potential symptoms. In a large study evaluatinguniversal screening with the Modi ed Checklist for Autism in Toddlers(M-CHAT), researchers askedphysicians to note whether they wereconcerned about ASD. Sensitivity ofphysician clinical concern was low (0.244; 30 of 123 cases; 95% con dence interval 0.17 -0.32). The sensitivity of the M-CHAT when usedas directed in this low-risk populationwas 0.91. 51Accurate early identi cation has been a goal of the AAP since the publication of the 2previous autism clinical reports in 2007, with focused continuing medical education and a tool kit (AAPAutism Toolkit: https://toolkits.solutions.aap.org/toolkits.aspx). Thegoal of universal screening, includingscreening for ASD, has beensupported by public health agencies 52 and family support organizations.53 Rates of screening for bothdevelopmental delays and ASD inprimary pediatric care have increasedsteadily. In the 2015 AAP survey ofscreening practices, almost three-quarters of pediatricians whoresponded reported routine ASDscreening. increasingly report including of ce staff for ef cient work flow, including administration and scoring ofscreening tests. Although time andremuneration remain as concerns,fewer pediatricians rate these asbarriers. Referral for and tracking ofevaluation and services remain a challenge associated with lack of ofce-based systems for making referrals and after screen-positiveoutcomes. 43 The authors of the 2019 AAPdevelopmental surveillance andscreening clinical report discussstrategies for billing for screeningand counseling in primary care. 49 The following sections describet o o l sc o m m o n l yu s e dt os c r e e na n ddiagnose ASD and emphasize the importance of ongoing surveillance, especially in childrenat high risk.

Commonly used autism-speci c screening tools that are based onquestionnaires and observation are s u m m a r i z e di nT a b l e6 .M a n yclinician-administered screening tests require speci ct r a i n i n g( e g , the Screening Tool for Autism inToddlers and Young Children [STAT]). 5,57A clinician- administered test like the STATincreases the likelihood of an ASD diagnosis on further testing and may be used to support a preliminary diagnosis of ASD to obtain services. 58Identi cation of infants and toddlers at risk for ASDbased on neurophysiologic makers or other biomarkers is discussed in the subsection The Biology of ASD inSection 4: Etiologic Evaluation.Screening by Age Group Children Younger Than Age 18 Months Earlier diagnosis of ASD may lead to earlier treatment. The M-CHAT is themost studied and widely used toolfor screening toddlers for ASD.Additional tools are underinvestigation and are listed in Table 6 as promising autism screening tests. Language delay can be identi ed by using the Infant and ToddlerChecklist (parent questionnaire) inlow-risk infants and toddlers between12 and 18 months of age. 43,59This questionnaire might be useful inidentifying infant siblings of children with ASD who are at increased risk for ASD. Additional research mayallow for screening of toddlers asyoung as 12 months by using parent-administered questionnaires such theCommunication and SymbolicBehavior Scales Development Pro le and the Infant and Toddler Checklist. 58 Primary care providers are tasked with identifying all children whowould bene t from early intervention, not just children at riskfor ASD (see the AAP clinical report\"Promoting Optimal Development: Identifying Infants and YoungChildren With DevelopmentalDisorders Through DevelopmentalSurveillance and Screening \" 49for further information). It is important to identify all clinically signi cant delays in children with referral for appropriate diagnostic evaluation andintervention. Problems with sleep,eating, constipation, and stateregulation are common in the generalpopulation but may be particularlychallenging in young children withASD. Pediatricians can help familieswith management of these symptoms. Children Ages 18 to 30 Months The most commonly usedquestionnaire-based screening tool isthe M-CHAT. It has been furthervalidated, and the scoring has been modi ed for ease of administration in primary care settings for children ages 16 to 30 months. 51The Modi ed Checklist for Autism in Toddlers,Revised with Follow-Up eliminates 3 questionsfrom the previous version. Childrenwho score $8 are at high risk for ASD or another developmental disorderand should be referred immediatelyfor diagnostic assessment. Forchildren with scores of 3 to 7, publiclyavailable scripted follow-up interviewquestions are required for the itemsscored as positive. Children whocontinue to have 3 to 7 items positive for ASD diagnosis after clarifying follow-up questions have a 47% riskof having ASD diagnosed and a 95%chance of being identi ed with some other developmental delay that wouldbenet from intervention. Children screened with the M-CHAT-R/F areidenti ed with ASD at younger ages than predicted by nationalstatistics. 49Children who do not pass ASD screening tests or who score asat risk for a diagnosis should bereferred for both diagnosticassessment and intervention services.Ad enitive diagnosis is not necessary to institute services for documented delays that would be served through early intervention or school services.Although the M-CHAT-R/F appears tobe useful for general screening ofdiverse populations, 60decreasing the disparity in early diagnosis willrequire adapting and validatingmeasures and addressing cultural and linguistic barriers to screening. 61 Measures under development may provide rapid screening whileaddressing clinician concerns for compatibility with an electronic record system and open access. 62TABLE 5 Resources and Guidance for Developmental Screening \u0081AAP Bright Futures: Guidelines for the Health Supervision of Infants, Children, and Adolescents \u0081AAP early childhood screening \u0081AAP clinical report: \"Promoting Optimal Development: Identifying Infants and Young Children With Developmental Disorders Through Developmental Surveillance and Screening\"49 \u0081Additional guidance for developmental and behavioral screening can be found in \"Birth to 5: Watch Me Thrive! \"which contains helpful information for the primary care provider about how to present the results of developmental screening (available at: https://www.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/ les/ecd/ pcp_screening_guide_march2014.pdf). 8 FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS by guest on August 26, 2021 www.aappublications.org/news Downloaded from TABLE 6 Commonly Used ASD Screening Tests Autism Screening TestsDescription Age Range Average No. ItemsAdministration TimeForms Available EHR compatiblePsychometric PropertiesScoring Method Cultural ConsiderationsSource Key References M-CHAT-R/F Parent-completed questionnaire designed to identify childrenat risk for autism the generalpopulation;follow-up clinician- administeredquestions andrepeat questionnaire required forspeci city16-30 mo 20 5 -10 min Yes Standardization sample included 16 071 children screened; 115had positive screen results, 348 neededevaluation, 221were and diagnosed withan ASD; children with a score $3 on the initial screen and $2 on follow-up had the general population; based on itemsin the ADI-R41y4 0 5 -10 min No Validated by using the ADI-R and DSM-IV on 200 subjects (160with pervasivedevelopmental disorder, 40 without pervasivedevelopmental disorder); for use in children withmental age of atRisk (pass/fail)Available in multiple languages; see testinformationfor details.Western Psychological Corporation: www. wpspublish.comRefs 77 and 572 PEDIATRICS Volume 145, number 1, January 2020 9 by guest on August 26, 2021 www.aappublications.org/news Downloaded from TABLE 6 Continued Autism Screening TestsDescription Age Range Average No. ItemsAdministration TimeForms Available EHR compatiblePsychometric PropertiesScoring Method Cultural ConsiderationsSource Key References least 2 y andchronologic age 41y; available sensitivity can improved withlowering cutoff for children younger than 5 yand 5 -7y , speci city poor for youngerchildren STAT interactive, and observation measure;requires training of clinician for standardizedadministration;not for population screening24-35 mo; ,24 mo (exploratory)12 20 -30 min No Validated by comparison with ADOS-G results in 52 children 24 -35 mo (26 with mo12 activities to http://stat. vueinnovations.

These and other online approaches to support screening strategies may beintegrated into ef cient patterns of practice. Results of screeningconducted online, in community settings, and in preschools should be communicated to the primary careprovider to ensure appropriate evaluation of etiology, co-occurring conditions, referral for diagnosis, and follow-up to ensure that intervention is accessed. 49 A systematic review by the USPreventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) concluded that the literature on existing screening tools did not demonstrate suf cient speci city to justify universal screening. 63The USPSTF noted that no study has directly examined whether children with ASD detected by early screening have better outcomes than those detected byother means. However, such a study would require random assignment of large representative samples from across the country to either a screening or nonscreeningcondition, with follow-up of long- term outcomes and societal costs. Given that early treatment of children younger than 36 months has been shown to result in positiveoutcomes, 43,64such a study would be challenging to support. The USPSTFconcluded that further research is indicated to evaluate the appropriate ages and populations of children whoshould be screened for ASD and that more accurate and culturally sensitive measures should be developed. TheAAP continues to recommendscreening using the most valid ofcurrent measures at 18 and24 months of age. Pediatricianscannot assume that early intervention systems will screen participants being served for language or globaldelays for ASD at the recommendedages. Universal screening isrecommended because symptoms ofASD can be identi ed in early childhood, and a diagnosis of ASD byskilled professionals is accurate in children as young as 18 months of age. 65Diagnostic stability is high for children who are diagnosed with ASDat 18 to 36 months of age. 43Early screening does not identify manychildren with milder symptoms andtypical cognitive ability as at risk forASD; therefore, ongoing surveillance remains necessary. 16Participation in early intervention in general is greatest among children who hadscreening and surveillance. 66 Children Older Than 30 Months At present, for children older than30 months, there are no validated screening tools available for use in pediatric practice, nor are therecurrent recommendations by the AAPfor universal screening for ASD inthat age group. The SocialCommunication Questionnaire (SCQ)(see Table 6) has been studied indifferent populations (eg, clinical sample, population reference sample, community sample, and conveniencesample), with best results inpopulation samples 67when using the lifetime version, and appears to havereasonable psychometric properties.However, questionnaires like the SCQmay identify symptoms that overlap with other conditions, such as ADHD, that affect function at school age. 68,69 Further validation of population-based screening tools for childrenolder than 30 months is neededbefore recommendations foruniversal screening of school-agedchildren can be made. At this time, ongoing surveillance in the context of primary care is recommended.Barriers to Identifying Risk for ASD Children with milder symptoms and/or average or above-average intelligence may not be identi ed with symptoms until school age,when differences in social languageor personal rigidities affect function.Some children who are laterdiagnosed with ASD are initiallybelieved to have precocious language, reading, or math skills, and it is not until the social demands of schoolthat the social language symptomsbecome problematic. It has also beensuggested that girls may have lesserintensity of symptoms and fewerexternalizing behaviors. Thesedifferences may, in part, result in underdiagnosis in girls. 70Speci c coexisting conditions may prevent clinicians from recognizing symptomsof ASD in early childhood. Forexample, 1 study revealed thatchildren who were initially identi ed with ADHD in primary care werediagnosed with ASD 3 years later compared with children who did not have earlier symptoms of ADHD. 69 Recognition and referral for olderchildren with social-skill de cits would be facilitated by thedevelopment of accurate and briefscreening tests for use in primarycare and school settings. Population surveillance data reveal later age at diagnosis for African American and Hispanic children, suggesting that there are barriers toscreening and surveillance andreferral for diagnosis in groups withother unmet health needs. 2Race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic statusdid not affect the accuracy of routinescreening tests for ASD in low-risk toddlers, suggesting that screening with appropriate supports for follow-up care can lower the age at diagnosisin diverse populations. 60Language barriers, inaccurate translations, andlow parental literacy maycompromise use of parent-completedquestionnaires. 71Limited understanding of cultural differencesexperienced by the patient 's family 12 FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS by guest on August 26, 2021 www.aappublications.org/news Downloaded from and lack of trust in the health care provider may further limitidenti cation and reporting of symptoms of autism. 72Screening tools need to be developed for populations of individuals whose primary language is not English andwho are also sensitive to culturalbarriers that may limit reporting ofsymptoms of ASD. 73 Diagnostic Evaluation Once a child is determined to be atrisk for a diagnosis of ASD, either byscreening or surveillance, a timelyreferral for clinical diagnostic evaluation and early intervention or school services, depending on his orher age, is indicated. 74Children with developmental delay with or withoutan ASD diagnosis should be referredto early intervention or schoolservices, in which cognitive andlanguage testing may be completed. The primary care provider should discuss with the family theimportance of both the assessment ofdevelopmental status and evaluationfor an ASD diagnosis and assist thefamily in navigating through theprocess, including connecting themwith community resources. Families with low income or language barriers may need additional attention to takethe next steps. Although most children will need to see a specialist, such as a developmental-behavioral orneurodevelopmental pediatrician,psychologist, neurologist, orpsychiatrist, for a psychologists comfortable withapplication of the DSM-5 criteria can make an initial clinical diagnosis. Having a clinical diagnosis mayfacilitate initiation of services. At thistime, there are no laboratory teststhat can be used to make a diagnosisof ASD, so careful review of the child 's behavioral history and directobservation of symptoms are necessary. 75,76To meet diagnostic criteria, the symptoms must impairfunction. Formal assessment of language, cognitive, and adaptiveabilities and sensory status is animportant component of thediagnostic process. Short clinical visits may not allow even a skilled clinician theopportunity to accurately recognize symptoms of ASD. 50An accurate history needs to re flect a longitudinal experience with the individual and reflect the effects of symptoms on the patient 's ability to function in family, peer, and school settings. This historyis obtained by interview with thepatient and caregivers, reports of behavior in other environments (such as school), and descriptions ofbehavior during formal testing. Thehistory of symptoms of ASD can besupported by questionnaires such asthe SCQ 77or Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS).78None of these questionnaires is suf cient alone to make a diagnosis of ASD, but allprovide a structured approach toelicit symptoms of ASD. Measuressuch as the Behavior AssessmentSystem for Children, 79Diagnostic Interview for Social andCommunication Disorders(DISCO), 80,81and the Child Behavior Checklist82are used to assess children and youth for otherbehavioral health conditions but mayalso identify behavioral pro les consistent with ASD. In some clinical and research settings, the behaviors associatedwith ASD are reported through theAutism Diagnostic Inventory-Revised parentinterview. criteria of ASD.The SCQ was designed to elicitsimilar information to the ADI-R inan abbreviated questionnaireformat. The SRS is a 65-itemquestionnaire that may be used tomeasure autistic traits on a continuum as part of a more complete evaluation of ASD. 78,85Elevated scores may be seen withgreater severity of symptoms of ASD as well as with intellectualdisability, communicationdifculties, and behavioral challenges. Structured observation of symptoms of ASD during clinical evaluation is helpful to inform the diagnosticapplication of the DSM-5 criteria.Validated observation tools used toprovide structured data to con rm the diagnosis include the AutismDiagnostic Observation Schedule,Second Edition (ADOS-2) and theChildhood Autism Rating Scale,Second Edition (CARS-2). 86No single observation tool is appropriate for allclinical settings. The observation toolis meant to support application of theDSM-5 criteria informed by historyand other data. The ADOS-2 was developed to elicit atypical social language and behaviors. With the ADOS-2, modulesare speci c for use across the age span of toddlers to adults. 87,88The ADOS-2 requires intensive training toaccurately administer and score andtakes 30 to 45 minutes to administer.It is often a component of bothresearch and clinical evaluations. Theinformation obtained from the ADOS-2 is used by the clinician inconjunction with the history of peerinteractions, social relationships, andfunctional impairment fromsymptoms to determine if the DSM-5criteria are met. The CARS-2 isanother structured approacha clinician might use to supporta of ASD. 89The clinician completes a 15-point scalethat is based on history andobservation. The ADOS-2, CARS-2,and SRS (Parent and Teacher) all ratechildren similarly in approximatelyhalf of identi ed cases. 90The integration of historical informationand objective observation bya clinician trained to diagnose autismand related conditions to inform theDSM-5 diagnostic criteria is the PEDIATRICS Volume 145, number 1, January 2020 13 by guest on August 26, 2021 www.aappublications.org/news Downloaded from critical element to diagnostic evaluation. Evaluation of Co-occurring Developmental Conditions Patients with ASD may have intellectual disabilities, learning disabilities, ADHD, anxiety disorders, or speech and language disorders,among others. These conditions mayinfluence the presentation of the symptoms of ASD. These conditionsmay in fluence the presentation of symptoms of ASD and may in fluence the social and functional impairment of the individual in different ways at different ages. Valid assessment ofcognitive and language ability is animportant component of thediagnostic evaluation. In the UnitedStates, early intervention services andschool systems will evaluate childrenin these domains to assess educational needs. In some areas, initial evaluations are performed inclinical settings and paid for byinsurance. Cognitive Testing A range of standardized measures are used to determine developmental levels of younger children and IQ inchildren older than 3 years. Theintelligence test selected by thepsychologist will depend on the ageand language level of the child.Administration of a valid cognitivetest is important in ascribing symptoms to ASD as part of the initial diagnosis but also helps to establishco-occurring diagnoses with ASD,such as intellectual disability. Thereare valid tests that can be used inchildren who are nonverbal. Althoughthe prevalence of a diagnosis of ASDis increased in children with an intellectual disability, 91other children diagnosed with intellectual disability may have some symptoms of ASDwithout meeting diagnostic criteriafor the disorder. Language Testing Inherent in the core symptoms of ASDare differences in the use of verbaland nonverbal communication forsocial interaction. Formal assessmentof communication by a speech orlanguage pathologist at the time ofdiagnosis should include the documentation of expressive and receptive language skills as well asthe pragmatic or conversational useof language. 92 Adaptive Function Testing A caregiver report and/or teacherreport of adaptive functioning complements objective cognitive testing. Determining the extent thatASD affects daily function isnecessary to establish eligibility forsome publicly funded programs aswell as to identify and monitordevelopmental goals for treatment.Adaptive behaviors are typically delayed in people who have intellectual disability with ASD butcan be impaired in people with ASDand an average-range IQ. 93,94 Commonly used adaptive measuresinclude the Vineland AdaptiveBehavior Scales and the AdaptiveBehavior Assessment System. 95 Motor Assessment Children with ASD are more likely tohave mild delays in gross motor skillsand coordination compared withchildren in the general populationand may meet DSM-5 criteria fordevelopmental coordination disorder in addition to ASD. 96General screening tests or adaptive measures may suggest motor delays that wouldbenet from formal evaluation by an occupational or physical therapist. Arelationship of early motor delays andsubsequent language and adaptivedevelopment in children with ASD has been proposed. 97,98 Sensory Assessment: Hearing Children with language delay or inattention to language should havean evaluation of their hearing as partof their initial evaluation. 99Hearing loss may co-occur with ASD and needs to be considered in children with language delays, behaviorproblems, or inattention. Appropriateampli cation should be offered, if indicated. The clinical utility ofauditory processing evaluationsavailable in current practice remain an area of study. 100,101 Sensory Assessment: Vision Visual function should be considered in the initial evaluation of childrenwho are visually inattentive, havestereotypical behaviors (such as eyepoking or close visual scrutiny), or donot make eye contact. Decreasedvisual acuity may affect interactive gaze and require accommodations in the educational setting. 102Children with visual impairment may alsodemonstrate stereotyped motorbehaviors. Sensory Assessment: Sensory Processing The DSM-5 includes sensory symptoms in the diagnostic criteriafor ASD. The DSM-5 does not includesensory processing disorder asa discrete diagnosis. Commonly usedevaluation tools (such as the Short Sensory Pro le and others) quantify parent perception of sensory differences relative to smell, taste,vision, hearing, and touch. 103,104In addition to capturing what isconventionally considered asa sensory disturbance, questionnairesthat are used to assess sensory symptoms also capture motor hyperactivity and hypoactivity assensory-seeking or sensory-avoidingbehaviors. These latter co-occurring ADHD. Sensory symptoms may be moreevident at younger ages and maydene subtypes of the disorder. 105,106 SECTION 4: ETIOLOGIC EVALUATION Children with a diagnosis of ASDshould be assessed for potentialetiology and common coexistingmedical conditions. At the time of the2007 AAP clinical reports on autism, karyotype and DNA testing for fragile X syndrome were the state-of-the-art 14 FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS by guest on August 26, 2021 www.aappublications.org/news Downloaded from etiologic investigations. Soon thereafter, chromosomal microarray(CMA) was endorsed by the AmericanCollege of Medical Genetics andGenomics and the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry as the most appropriate initial test foretiologic evaluation of children withASD. 76,107 -110Despite rapid technological advances inneuroimaging and other areas, manyof the recommendations for clinicalevaluation published in 2007 are unchanged. This section summarizes recent advances in understanding theetiologies of ASD and how theytranslate into recommendations forclinical practice. Medical Workup of the Child With ASD Genetic Testing Advances such as the development of CMA and next-generation sequencingtechnologies and the application ofthese technologies to well-characterized patient cohorts haveled to progress in the understandingof the complex genetics of ASD andother neurodevelopmental disorders in the last decade. Identifying a genetic etiology provides clinicianswith more information for familiesabout prognosis and recurrence riskand may help to identify and treat orprevent co-occurring medicalconditions, guide patients andfamilies to condition-speci c resources and supports, and avoidordering unnecessary tests(Table 7). 111 -117Most parents nd this information to be useful.118As research progresses, genetic testingmay contribute to identifyingeffective interventions related tospeci c etiologies. Etiologic investigation begins witha careful medical, developmental-behavioral, and family history anda thorough physical and neurologicexamination. 109The history should include potential prenatal exposure toteratogens (such as medications, alcohol, drugs) and other factors that increase risk for ASD. 109,119Thephysical examination should includeassessment of growth relative totypical curves dysmorphic and neurologicabnormalities. 109Genetic evaluation should be recommended and offeredto all families as part of the etiologicworkup. A stepwise general approachis provided in Table 8 as a practicalguideline. 110,120The presence of dysmorphic features or intellectualdisability is generally associated withTABLE 7 Potential Bene ts of Establishing a Genetic Etiologic Diagnosis \u0081Improving accuracy of counseling provided to patients and families: o Prognosis or expected clinical course o Recurrence risk for the family and the individual affected \u0081Providing condition-speci c family support, such as: o Improving psychosocial outcomes for patients and their families (eg, knowledge and sense of empowerment, parental quality of life) \u0081Preventing morbidity and treating medical conditions associated with the genotype, such as: o Conditions or anomalies likely to be present at diagnosiso Conditions that may develop later \u0081Rening treatment options, including: o Avoiding therapeutic interventions that may be based on unfounded etiologic theorieso Avoiding ineffective or potentially harmful treatmentso Providing access to emerging etiology-speci c treatments \u0081Facilitating acquisition of needed services and access to research treatment protocols \u0081Avoiding additional diagnostic tests, which may be unnecessary, expensive, and/or uncomfortable Adapted from Sun F, Oristaglio J, Levy SE, et al.

PEDIATRICS Volume 145, number 1, January 2020 15 by guest on August 26, 2021 www.aappublications.org/news Downloaded from increased likelihood of nding a genetic abnormality.121However, authors of some clinical studies have identi ed similar yield for genetic testing in children without these risk factors.122,123 In some cases, individuals with clinical genetic syndromes, such as fragile X syndrome, tuberous sclerosis complex, and others (such as thosedescribed in Supplemental Table 13),also meet criteria for ASD. 124,125 When a speci c syndrome or metabolic disorder is suspected, theclinician should proceed with theappropriate targeted testing or referral to a pediatric geneticist or neurologist. For example, a girl withsignicant developmental delays, deceleration in head growth velocity,and characteristic midline handmovements should prompt genetictesting for a mutation or deletion orduplication of MECP2 , the gene implicated in Rett syndrome. 109,126 Another speci c example would be a boy with ASD with markedmacrocephaly and pigmentedmacules on the penis, ndings that would warrant sequencing anddeletion or duplication analysis of thePTEN gene. 127Descriptions of these and other clinical syndromesassociated with ASD are provided inSupplemental Table 13. CMA is recommended if the etiology for developmental disability is not known. CMA identi es copy number variants (CNVs) at this time, whichare DNA duplications or deletionsthat alter the function of genes(Table 8, step 2). CMA revealsad enitively pathogenic CNV in 5.4% to 14% (median 9%) individuals with ASD in clinical samples. 121,128 -135When CNVs of uncertain signi cance are to 42% ofpatients with ASD have ndings on the CMA. Some of the variants ofuncertain signi cance may be determined as pathogenic in the future. The most commonly identi ed recurrent pathogenic CNVs amongindividuals with ASD are provided in Supplemental Table 14. Because fragile X syndrome increases risk for ASD, DNA testing for fragile Xsyndrome should be recommendedfor all children with ASD, butespecially for boys and children witha suggestive family history of male members with intellectual disability. Physical examination might reveal thecommon features of a large head size,prominent jaw, large ears,ligamentous laxity, and, in malepatients, large testes after puberty.The cytosine-guanine-guaninetrinucleotide repeat expansion that is responsible for fragile X syndrome is not detected on CMA and must beordered as a separate test. Thecurrent estimate is thatapproximately 0.45% of individualswith ASD have the full mutation forfragile X syndrome, and many of themare female. 130,132,135 -137Because fragile X syndrome testing isrelatively inexpensive and thecondition has important geneticcounseling implications, it isreasonable to consider testing bothmale and female patients with ASD, atleast until more data becomeavailable to clarify the issue. When the history and physical examination, CMA, and fragile Xanalysis do not identify an etiology,the next step at this time in the etiologic evaluation for ASD is whole- exome including pathogenic loss-of-function mutations and missensemutations, which have been found tobe associated with ASD. 138 -142 Examples of ASD risk genes identi ed or con rmed in WES studies are provided in Supplemental Table 15.As with other tests, cliniciansordering this test should be familiarwith both pretest counseling andinterpretation of the results. A geneticcounselor is helpful in explaining the reason for testing as well as the results. Large clinical WES studieshave consistently been used toidentify a molecular diagnosis in 26%to 29% of individuals for whomneurodevelopmental disorders werethe primary indication for testing. 143 -145Authors of studies of clinical populations with ASD have reported diagnostic yields of 8% to20%. 121,144The yield of WES is higher when both the parents and thechild who is affected are evaluated 144 to allow for comparison of the childwith parents who are unaffected. Some geographic areas may have limited availability of pediatricsubspecialists (eg, in genetics or metabolism) who can guide the genetic workup, so primary careproviders may be in the position toconsider and direct etiologicevaluation. The complexity of genetictesting is such that most primary careproviders may want to consult witha specialist to plan testing and interpret results. The clinical etiologic evaluation should be tailored to theindividual patient, taking intoconsideration information fromthe history and physicalexamination 109,110and the values and wishes of the family. The stepwisegeneral approach summarized in Table 8 can be used to guide this process. It is important for families to understand that genetic tests may explain the cause of their child 's ASD or provide information about the statistical risk of ASD, but they arenot diagnostic of ASD; the diagnosisof ASD is made on the basis of clinicalsymptoms. Unlike CMA and WES,commercially marketed tests may nothave the potential to provide a molecular etiologic diagnosis. Genomic testing technology isevolving rapidly, as is ourunderstanding of the geneticarchitecture of ASD, and theserecommendations for testing willneed to be updated as new studiesare published. 146For example, it is anticipated that CMA and WES willsoon be combined because of 16 FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS by guest on August 26, 2021 www.aappublications.org/news Downloaded from improvements in accurate identi cation of CNVs using sequence data and that sequencing of theexome will be replaced by sequencingof the entire genome as issues with interpretation and cost become more manageable. 121,130,147 -150 Parents of a child with ASD should becounseled regarding recurrence risk in subsequent offspring, and the nature of the counseling dependsgreatly on whether a speci c genetic cause of the child 's ASD has been identi ed. When a speci c genetic etiology has been determined, thefamily can be provided withinformation about the risk of recurrence in subsequent offspring. However, when genetic testing hasnot been completed or has notrevealed the etiology of the child 's ASD, recurrence risk counseling isbased on group averages derivedfrom the existing literature. Fora couple with 1 child with ASD of unknown cause, the current best estimate of recurrence ina subsequent child is approximately10% (range 4% -14% 151 -153). If a couple already has $2 children with ASD of unknown etiology (idiopathic),the chance of a subsequent childhaving ASD may be as high as 32% to 36%. 151,154However, the risk is not limited to ASD. Siblings of children with ASD who do not have ASDthemselves may have a 20% to 25%risk for language disorders Neuroimaging Speci c clinical neuroimaging ndings are not prevalent in ASD compared with otherneurodevelopmental disorders, nordo speci c in neuroimaging studiesobtained in the workup of children diagnosed with ASD but rarely provide etiologic information orrequire intervention. 159,160The need for clinical MRI should be directed bya history and physical examination.MRI may be indicated in theevaluation of atypical regression, microcephaly, macrocephaly, seizures, abnormal or other clinicalindications. 76,109,161,162Imaging technology used to examine brainstructure and function providesvaluable insight into the neurobiology of ASD in research settings and may lead to useful clinical applications inthe future. Metabolic Testing The yield of routine metabolic testingfor children with ASD is low and notrecommended for regular use. 163 -167 However, large population-basedstudies are lacking, so accurateprevalence and diagnostic yieldestimates are not available. Metabolicworkup should be informed byhistory, family history, symptoms, andexamination and might includemeasurement of fasting plasma amino acid levels, urine organic acid levels, and acylcarnitine metabolite levelsand other testing for speci c metabolic disorders. History ofatypical regressions (later than2 years of age, motor regression, ormultiple regressions), family historyof early childhood death or diagnosed metabolic disorders, and physical features, such as signi cant hypotonia or weakness, visual and hearingimpairment, and dysmorphicfeatures, would suggest consultationwith a specialist to guide evaluationfor metabolic or mitochondrialdisorders. 109,168Children who present uncommoncauses of ASD, the potential impact ishigh because treatment may be available and the inheritance pattern may be known. 109,124Examples ofmetabolic conditions that may beassociated with an ASD phenotypeare provided in SupplementalTable 16. There is no evidence at thistime for routine testing of hair, blood, or urine for environmental toxins or heavy metals outside of laboratoryscreening for lead exposure. 169 EEG Children with ASD have an increasedrisk for seizures, and EEGabnormalities are common in theabsence of clinical seizures (see Seizures section for more information). 170 -175However, EEG is not recommended as a routinebaseline evaluation in the absence ofclinical concern about seizures,atypical regression, or otherneurologic symptoms on history orexamination that would suggest an EEG is indicated. 161,170,172,176Late or atypical loss of language, as might be observed in electrical statusepilepticus of sleep with loss oflanguage, should be evaluated with anovernight EEG. 161,170,172,176Primary care clinicians should discuss theincreased risk and the signs and symptoms of seizures with the families of children diagnosed withASD, maintain a high index of clinicalsuspicion for seizures, and consultwith a pediatric neurologist whenconcerned about atypical regressionor the possibility of seizures. 170,172,176 The Biology of ASD Genetics and ASD ASD is clinically and etiologically heterogeneous yet highly heritable.The rate of ASD in siblings is muchhigher than the rate in the general population. Twin studies demonstrate substantially higher concordancerates for symptoms of ASD inmonozygotic twins than in dizygotictwins. 177A meta-analysis involving 64% to 91%. 177,178 PEDIATRICS Volume 145, number 1, January 2020 17 by guest on August 26, 2021 www.aappublications.org/news Downloaded from Siblings may also be at risk for symptoms related to ASD that do notmeet the threshold for a diagnosis ofASD and have been described as thebroader autism phenotype. 141,179 These data provide strong evidencefor a genetic contribution to ASDrisk. 180 -184 Risk for ASD also is increased in thechildren of both older fathers andolder mothers. 185 -187The increased risk with parental age may be related to germline mutations in older fathers.143,188Mechanisms mediating the effect of advancing maternal ageon ASD risk are less clear. 143 Increased maternal and paternal ageare independently associated withASD risk, and a joint effect seems tooccur as well. 185 -187 Important aspects of the genetics ofASD are still poorly understood,including the role of commonvariants, epistasis (gene-geneinteractions), and environmentalmodi cation of genotype effects. In such as CMA andnext-generation sequencingtechnologies have resulted inidenti cation of withASD, including CNVs, which aredeletions or duplications $1000 bp in size that alter the dosage of genes,and sequence-nucleotidevariants. 189 -192Pathogenic rare variants may arise beinherited as autosomal dominant,autosomal recessive, or X-linkedmutations. Researchers of CMA andWES studies have established that although de novo and inherited rare variants of large effect size arecollectively common, no individualpathogenic variant accounts for morethan 1% of cases of ASD.* Genes thatcontribute to ASD are involved ina variety of biological functions, withconvergence on aspects of brain development and function, including synaptic structure and function,intracellular signaling, transcriptionregulation, and chromatinremodeling. 139,190,191,196It is important to note that no speci c mutation has been identi ed that is unique to ASD; there is substantialgenetic overlap between ASD andother neurodevelopmental disorders,including intellectual disability,epilepsy, and schizophrenia. 197 -204 Genes, Environmental Exposures, and ASD The potential environmental factors that may be related to increasedreported prevalence of ASD is an areaof active study that, as yet, is withoutrm conclusions. 119Environmental factors associated with ASD include inutero exposure to medications suchas valproate and thalidomide. Otherprenatal such as short interpregnancy interval, multiplegestation, maternal obesity,gestational bleeding, gestational diabetes, advanced parental age, and infections (eg, rubella andcytomegalovirus), may be associatedwith increased risk for ASD. 205 -209 Perinatal factors, such as pretermbirth, low birth weight, small present independent risk toprenatal brain development or mayaffect gene function in individualswith genetic predisposition. 213 Population-level associations withASD have been examined for organophosphates and certain other pesticides, metals, volatile organiccompounds, and air pollution,particularly particulate matter andnitrogen dioxide. 214 -216Research on environmental exposures may be ofgreat importance in identifyingmodi able risk factors related to ASD and other developmental disorders. Itis prudent to limit exposure ofchildren and pregnant women toknown neurotoxicants.Genes, Immunologic Exposures, and ASD It has been proposed that children with ASD-associated CNVs may be more susceptible to environmentalinsult in the form of maternalimmune activation. Report ofmaternal infection or fever duringpregnancy may be associated withincreased severity of ASD-relatedsymptoms in offspring who are affected. 217The pathogenic role of circulating maternal antibodies directed to fetal brain tissue and thepotential value of maternal antibodypanels as biomarkers of ASD arecurrently being studied. 218 -222Unless otherwise indicated (eg, historysuggestive of autoimmune or immunologic disorder), no immune testing is recommended in theetiologic workup of a child with ASD. produce heritable changes in gene expression that do not involve a change in the DNA sequence. Some genetic disordersassociated with ASD (eg, Rettsyndrome; genesthat either encode epigeneticregulators or are sensitive to alterations in their epigenetic regulation. 223,224Because epigenetic modi cations can be in fluenced by environmental factors, such asprenatal maternal exposures andpostnatal experience, they represent1 interface between genes andenvironment. However, epigenetic modi cations are not the only mechanisms by which gene expression is regulated, andepigenetics should not be con flated with the broader category ofenvironmental effects. 223,225 Currently, the evidence that alterationof gene expression by environmental factors plays a causal role in ASD is very limited. 223 -228Investigation of * Refs 121, 144, 189 -195. 18 FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS by guest on August 26, 2021 www.aappublications.org/news Downloaded from the role of epigenetic and other nongenetic modi cations that alter gene activity withoutchanging the DNA sequence is anactive area of etiologic research in ASD. Vaccines The scienti c literature does not support an association of vaccination as an environmentalfactor that increases the risk for ASD. Children with ASD should be vaccinated according to therecommended schedule.Epidemiological studies do notdemonstrate any association of themeasles-mumps-rubella vaccine,mercury exposure by thimerosal-containing vaccines, aluminum in vaccines, or increased level of immunologic exposure attributableto a larger number of vaccines(either given at 1 time orcumulatively) with ASD. 214,229 -246 Vaccines used for children in theUnited States have not containedthimerosal since 2001. The authors of a 2012 Cochrane review 234and a 2014 quantitative meta-analysis of pooled data from cohort studiesinvolving 1 256 407 children andcase-control studies involving 9920children reviewed the scienti c literature and came to thisconclusion. 231Evidence implicating immunizations as a \"second hit \" conferring ASD risk in geneticallysusceptible subgroups is lacking. Ithas been shown that the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine is notassociated with increased risk forASD, even among children who arealready at higher risk because of having an older sibling with ASD. 229 Media coverage of vaccine issues may infl ate the perception of uncertainty by equal coverage ofvaccine proponents and opponents.The overwhelming weight ofevidence supports vaccine safety. 247 Communicating information about vaccine safety is a critical component of pediatric practice.248Brain Structure and ASD: Neuropathology Neuropathological research has been limited by the small number ofpostmortem brains available for study. Developmental brain abnormalities in people with ASD arereported in the cerebral neocortex;limbic system and abnormal neuronal migration. 249 -251The vast majority of abnormalities describedoriginate during prenatal braindevelopment. 249,251,252Findings in the cerebral cortex may include focaldisruption of neuronal migration,minicolumnar abnormalities, and variations in neuronal density. 249,251,252A decreased number of Purkinje cells in thecerebellum is 1 of the mostconsistently reportedneuropathologic ndings associated with ASD. Although it was initiallythought to be of prenatal onset, evidence now indicates that this phenomenon is more likely to be anacquired process that occurspostnatally, potentially related toseizures, medications, and/orischemia near the time of death orfactors other than ASD. 249No uniform neuropathology has been identi ed in people with ASD. Biomarkers Objectively measured biologicalcharacteristics, or biomarkers, of ASDcould potentially be used to predictASD risk, enhance screening, and permit presymptomatic detection. Their use could improve thereliability and validity of clinicaldiagnosis (identifying clinicallymeaningful subgroups that wouldallow for prediction of prognosis ortreatment response), identifymechanisms for developing treatment, and con rm the need for a speci c intervention. 221,253 -255Early Brain Overgrowth Cross-sectional and longitudinalstudies suggest that as a group, children later diagnosed with ASDmay have an average or below-average head circumference at birth,with an acceleration in brain growthbefore 2 years of age. 256This rapid brain growth leads to signi cantly above-average head circumferences and MRI brain volumes in toddlers, followed by a plateau in brain growth,with brain volumes in adolescenceand adulthood similar to those ofcontrols. 257,258Almost 16% of young children with ASD have a headcircumference greater than the 97thpercentile. 258A preliminary study suggested that infant siblings ofchildren with ASD who exhibiteda larger head circumference at12 months and showed more slowingof head circumference growth from12 to 24 months had an increasedchance of demonstrating symptomsof ASD. 259,260Although this nding raises the possibility that patterns ofbrain growth might be used for earlyidenti cation, the rate of head growth did not predict which infantsdeveloped ASD in the rst 3 years of life in a large prospective study ofhigh-risk infants. 261It is possible that a large head size is unrelated to ASD and/or may be part of general somatic overgrowth.262 -265 Neuroimaging Patterns Associated With ASD in Research Studies Although there are confl icting ndings, structural MRI volumetric studies suggest that young children with ASD differ from controls in totalbrain volume, cortical gray and white matter volume (particularly frontal, temporal, and cingulate cortices),extraaxial cerebral spinal fluid volume, and amygdala volume. 266 -271 A research-level analysis also hasidenti ed asymmetries in multiple brain structures in people withASD. 272Diffusion tensor imaging has been used to identify altered patternsin white matter by 6 months of age in PEDIATRICS Volume 145, number 1, January 2020 19 by guest on August 26, 2021 www.aappublications.org/news Downloaded from infants later diagnosed with ASD.270,273Functional MRI has demonstrated differences in peoplewith ASD relative to controls inefciency of visual processing, executive function, language, andbasic and complex social processingskills. 274,275Functional MRI in research settings demonstratedifferences in the mechanisms ofattention to social stimuli,modulation in response to taskdemands or intensity of stimuli, and executive function in people with ASD. 274Functional underconnectivity has also beendemonstrated across a wide varietyof the brain regions that supportlanguage, executive function,social cognition, emotionprocessing, frontal- posterior networks. 274,276,277 Electrophysiologic Testing and Measurement of Eye Tracking Electrophysiologic research studies demonstrate differences in auditoryprocessing (including language processing), visual processing (including face processing),somatosensory response,multisensory integration,attentional shifting, selectiveattention, recognition memory, andneural connectivity 278 -281Continuous measures of resting-state and task-relatedquantitative EEG are used tocalculate and describe spectralpower, complexity, and coherence.Although promising, the clinicalutility of these measures asbiomarkers requires additionalstudy. 279Eye tracking has been used to determine if infants whoare younger siblings of childrenwith ASD and, therefore,at increased risk for ASD exhibitdifferences in xation on faces. 282-284 Preliminary evidence suggeststhat infants later diagnosed withASD exhibit a decline in gaze xation from age 2 to age 6 months. 285Other Potential Biomarkers Although some studies haveattempted to differentiate people with and without ASD on the basis ofdifferences in laboratory pro les of laboratory tests have been approved for ASD. 286,287To date, none of these potential biomarkers under study has suf cient evidence to be recommended. Biomarkers: Future Directions Proposed biomarkers for ASD riskinclude genetic and biochemicalndings in blood, urine, or brain tissue; placental pathology; maternalautoantibody pro les; structural and electrophysiological test results on EEG, including event-relatedpotentials; responses in eye tracking;and physical parameters such as headcircumference growth trajectory.Although none of these proposedbiomarkers has demonstratedsufcient predictive validity for clinical use at this time, 221,253 -255,288 the search for biomarkers is a majorresearch focus. Biomarker researchhas important ethical issues, 253and concerns have appropriately beenraised regarding prematuretranslation of research data intocommercially available tests marketed to patients and families. 221,253,289,290However, the capabilities to screen large numbersof bioactive compounds, examine theentire genome, and simultaneouslyanalyze large data sets haveaccelerated research into theneurobiology of ASD and may result in the identi cation of valid biomarkers. 221,255,291 SECTION 5: INTERVENTIONS The goals of treatment of children with ASD are to (1) minimize core decits (social communication and interaction and restricted orrepetitive behaviors and interests)1 and co-occurring associated impairments292-294; (2) maximize functional independence byfacilitating learning and acquisition ofadaptive skills; and (3) eliminate, minimize, or prevent problem behaviors that may interfere with functional skills. 6,295,296Treatments should be individualized, developmentally appropriate, and intensive, with performance data relevant to treatment goals to evaluate and adjust intervention.6,297 All interventions should be based on sound theoretical constructs, rigorous methodologies, and objective scienti c evidence of effectiveness. Since the publication of the 2007 AAPclinical reports on autism,a substantial published literature has examined the effectiveness of interventions. 48,295,297,298Legal mandates in education law in theUnited States, which include theIndividuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004 (IDEA) (Public Law 108 -446) and the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001(Public Law 107 -110) and its successor, the Every Student Succeeds Act of 2015 ( Public Law 114 -95), require the use of practices supportedby scienti cally based research (IDEA and the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001) or evidence-based practices (Every Student Succeeds Act of 2015) (https://www.ed.gov/). Early intervention services under part C of IDEA provide for assessment andintervention for children younger than 3 years with developmental delays, including ASD. Interventions for children with ASD are provided through educationalpractices, developmental therapies,and behavioral interventions. Treatment strategies may vary by the age and strengths and weaknesses of the child. For example, intervention for a toddler with a recent diagnosisof ASD may include behavioral and developmental approaches (individually or in the context of 20 FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS by guest on August 26, 2021 www.aappublications.org/news Downloaded from comprehensive approach) and, as he or she progresses, involvement ina specialized or typical preschool program. For older children, intervention is more likely to occur ineducational settings, with integration of behavioral and developmental therapies to promote skill development. In addition to variation by age of the child, interventionsdiffer in theoretical approach and scope (eg, focused and targeted or comprehensive), settings and/or modality of delivery (eg, individual versus group or classroom, deliveredby a professional versus a trained parent, and school versus home setting), and targets of intervention. 48,297Interventions may be provided through public and/or not-for-pro t agencies, schools, and early intervention services, and somemay be paid for through insurance. 299 Families should be involved in theselection of intervention approachesand remain an involved participant in subsequent educational and therapeutic decisions. There is regional variation in the availability of various types of therapy andproviders that sometimes results in long waits for service, less-than- desired intensity, or inability to obtain a desired intervention altogether. By law, students with ASDshould receive an appropriate educational program, although it may not include all of the components desired by the family. Advocacy is often necessary to obtain desiredservices through schools or through mechanisms paid for by insurance. It is noted that many of the interventions in common use do not have a strong evidence base. Sometypes of intervention may not be paid for by insurance. Systematic reviews of the evidence base for treatment have been completed on early intensive intervention, 44,300medical treatments,301behavioral interventions,294,298and evidence- based practice guidelines.292,302Wong evidence-based interventions, thecomprehensive treatment model(CTM) and focused interventions.These interventions may be provided in different settings (eg, the home, classroom, naturalistic environment,or community), by different providers(eg, developmental specialist,behavioral therapist, educator, ortrained parent), individually or ingroup settings, and by using a setcurriculum or guide. The CTM uses a central conceptual framework to address a broad arrayof symptoms and is designed toaddress speci c skill(s) or symptom(s). A CTM should bereplicable, intense, and designed toaddress multiple therapeutic goalsover a period of time. Provision ofservices may occur in individualinstruction or class settings(specialized or inclusive), shouldinclude parents, and may involve technology-assisted intervention. 303 Applied behavior analysis (ABA), developmental approaches, and/ornaturalistic approaches may be usedin CTMs. 303Examples of CTMs include intensive behavioralintervention, of Autistic and RelatedCommunication-HandicappedChildren (TEACCH), and the EarlyStart Denver Model (ESDM). 295,303 Focused intervention practices aredesigned to address a single orlimited range of skills, such asincreasing social communication orlearning a speci c task, and may be delivered over a short period oftime. 295,297,303Focused intervention practices may be behavioral,developmental, and/or educational.Focused interventions may begrounded in principles of ABA, inwhich speci c skills are taught in a stepwise progression by usingprinciples of reinforcement ordevelopmental theory, in which the emerging skills inherent in neurobehavioral maturation arepromoted. These interventions areprovided in a structured setting by anadult, in naturalistic environmentswith peers, or as a component ofa more comprehensive approach. 295 Focused interventions may beeffective for promoting skilldevelopment andcommunication. 295,297,304,305 Pediatricians may be asked to advisefamilies on therapy choices or writeprescriptions for therapies. 306It is helpful for clinicians to have anunderstanding of intervention terminology and of the evidence base so they can effectively communicatethe rationale for medically indicatedtreatment recommendations withfamilies, educators, therapists, andother service providers as well aswith insurance companies, healthcare administrators, funding agencies, and policy makers. 295 This report describes various types ofinterventions provided for children and youth with ASD. Additionalresearch is needed to evaluate theeffectiveness of current approachesand develop interventions thataddress core de cits of ASD. At the time of diagnosis, parents of youngpreschool children may ask their provider to help them decide what type of intervention they should elect.Two common theoretical approachesto intervention for symptoms of ASDare ABA and developmentalmodels. 296 -298,307Although these approaches have importantdistinctions, they also have signi cant overlap, and interventionsincreasingly are incorporating aspectsof both. There is considerableregional variation in the availability ofvarious interventions. Table 9describes common characteristics ofempirically supportedinterventions. 296,297,308,309 Approaches to Intervention ABA Most evidence-based treatment models are based on principles of ABA. ABA has been de ned as \"the PEDIATRICS Volume 145, number 1, January 2020 21 by guest on August 26, 2021 www.aappublications.org/news Downloaded from process of systematically applying interventions based upon the principles of learning theory to improve socially signi cant behaviors to a meaningful degree, and to demonstrate that the interventionsemployed are responsible for theimprovement in behavior. \" 310The use of ABA methods to treat symptoms ofASD suggests that behaviors exhibitedcan be altered by programmatically reinforcing skills related to communication and other skillacquisition. 311,312Thus, ABA treatments may target developmentof new skills (eg, social engagement)and/or minimize behaviors (eg,aggression) that may interfere witha child 's progress. ABA interventions vary from highly structured adult-directed approaches (eg, discrete trial training orinstruction, verbal behaviorapplications, and others) tointerventions in naturalenvironments that may be child led and implemented in the context ofplay activities or daily routines andactivities and are altered on the basisof the child 's skill development (eg, pivotal response training, reciprocalimitation training, andothers). 297,309,312,313To determine what intervention is mostappropriate, the behavioral clinicianworks with the family and child todetermine which skills to target fordevelopment and maintenance andwhat goals are appropriate. ABA programs are typically designed and supervised by professionalscertied in behavior analysis. The majority of states at this time havelicensure for board-certi ed behavior analysts with provisions for paymentby insurance. ABA may be prescribedor recommended by a physician orlicensed psychologist. A comprehensive ABA approach for younger children, also known as earlyintensive behavioral intervention, issupported by a few randomizedcontrolled trials (RCTs) anda substantial single-subjectliterature. 297When only RCTs are considered, few interventions havesufcient evidence to be endorsed either for children younger than 12 years 298or for adolescents.314 Children younger than 12 years receiving more hours per week of ABA were found to be more likely to achieve the individualized goalsidenti ed in their programs. 315In retrospective studies, more intenseABA therapy was associated withachieving optimal developmentaloutcomes. 316Given the heterogeneity of the ASD phenotype, the service needs of children, youth, and adults need to be individualized by usingavailable clinical data. In some instances, a behavioral intervention is needed to address acute serious problem behaviors thatTABLE 9 Characteristics of Effective Interventions Features of Practice Common Characteristics of Empirically Supported Interventions Assessment and goals Systematically assess skills Include input of family (shared decision-making) Select individualized measurable goals and instructional procedures on the basis of objective assessment of each child Use assessment-based, empirically supported instructional methods to build, generalize, and maintain skills and reduce problem behaviors Instructional methods Address core symptoms in social communication and restricted and repetitive behaviors as well as skill de cits Provide a student/teacher ratio low enough to address the child 's individualized goals Interventions should be by providers who are properly trained and should maintain delity with the treatment approach selected Ensure that multiple providers work collaboratively Services and supports Individualize services and support Make use of the child 's interests and preferences in determining reinforcement systems Incorporate preferred activities to increase engagement in activities Environment Provide a structured learning environment that helps children anticipate transition between activities, including a predictable routine and visual activity schedules Organize workspaces to minimize distraction and promote task completionLimit access to things that may distract a studentThe environment should promote opportunities for the student to initiate communication and interact with peers Behavioral managementImplement a functional behavioral analysis to identify the reasons why challenging behaviors occur and develop a behavior improvement plan based on this assessment (IDEA-mandated approach) Teach children more appropriate responses using the behavior improvement plan Progress Systematically measure and document the individual child 's progress Adjust instructional strategies as necessary to enable acquisition of target skills Family support Involve and educate families so they can use the behavioral strategies at home and in the communityTransition planning Plan for transitions in school settings and to adulthood (eg, from home-based early intervention to preschool services, preschool to elementary school, elementary school to middle school, middle school to high school, high school to work or postsecondary education, and home to community living) Adapted from Smith T, Iadarola S.

The targetsymptoms to treat may then bedivided into component parts that areaddressed in a stepwise fashion (taskanalysis). 313,317Once the reasons for the behavior are understood, a behavior improvement plan may be implemented. Developmental Relationship -Focused Interventions Intervention for young children alsomay be derived from developmental theory, which is focused on the relationship between the caregiver 's level of responsiveness and thechild 's development of social communication. 296,318 -320Through interaction with others, children learnto communicate and regulateemotions and establish a foundation for increasingly complex thinking and social interaction. Therefore,developmental models designed topromote social development inchildren with ASD are focused on therelationship between the child withASD and his or her caregiver throughcoaching to help increase responsiveness to the adult (ie, the interventionist or parent orcaregiver) through imitating,expanding on, or joining into child-initiated play activities. This approachmay address core symptoms ofASD, such as joint attention,imitation, and affective social engagement. 296,297,321,322 Developmental models for intervention are focused on teachingadults to engage in nondirectiveinteractive strategies to fosterinteraction and development ofcommunication in the context of play.One such approach is known as DIRFloortime (The Developmental, Individual Differences, andRelationship-Based model). In 1 RCTcomparing parent coaching using thisapproach to community interventionalone ( N= 112) in children ages 2 to 5 years, parents who were taught this approach were less directive, and their children were rated as moresocially responsive, although IQ andlanguage scores were no differentbetween groups, and half of thechildren in the control groupimproved in their affective ratings. 323 A similar approach is relationship development intervention,324and more research is needed to evaluate efcacy and community use. Naturalistic Developmental Behavioral Intervention Naturalistic developmental behavioral interventions (NDBIs) incorporate elements of ABA anddevelopmental principles, such asemphasis on developmentally basedlearning targets and foundationalsocial learning skills, with delivery ofinterventions in the context ofnaturally occurring social activities within natural environments. They use child-initiated teaching episodes,naturally occurring opportunities forlearning, and turn-taking interactionswithin play routines and implementABA-based approaches to addressmeasurable goals. 296 The most extensively studied NDBI approach is the ESDM, which prepares children to learn innaturalistic environments. 325In a multisite trial of ESDM, early age atentry to therapy and more hours oftotal therapy were associated withimproved outcome. 326Of note, the 48 children randomly assigned to ESDM or community treatment in the original trial were studied by usingevent-related potentials and spectralpower on EEG while viewing faces asopposed to objects and werecompared with typical controls onthese tasks. This is an earlydemonstration of improvement on a neurophysiologic measure associated with improvement ona clinical measure of social behaviorthrough an early interventionprogram. 327 Combined Approaches Common factors in combineddevelopmental and behavioralapproaches include use of principlesof ABA to reinforce skill building;a systematic approach with a manualfor training practitioners who would use the intervention in a standard fashion; individualized treatmentgoals for the child and means ofmeasuring progress; child-initiatedteaching, imitation, and modeling;and adult prompting that fades overtime to promote independence. 296It may be dif cult to advise parents on speci c programs in community settings because the way the programis conducted may differ from theresearch settings. 328However, it is always accurate to describe thecommon characteristics of empiricallysupported interventions andrecommend that families seek interventions that incorporate these features (Table 9). Parent-Mediated Treatment or Parent Management Training Increasing evidence reveals that focused interventions delivered bytrained parents or other caregiverscan be an important part ofa therapeutic program. 297,329 -332 More RCTs have been published onparent-mediated therapies than onother nonpharmacologicinterventions. What is sometimescalled parent management training isdivided into 2 categories: parentsupport and parent-mediatedinterventions. Parent support interventions, which are knowledge- focused and provide indirect bene t to the child, include care coordinationand psychoeducation. Parent-mediated interventions, which aretechnique-focused and provide directbenet to the child, may target core symptoms of ASD or other behaviors or skills and may be built on ABA approaches in natural settings. 331 PEDIATRICS Volume 145, number 1, January 2020 23 by guest on August 26, 2021 www.aappublications.org/news Downloaded from Training sessions for caregivers may be delivered in the home, clinic,school, or other communitysettings or remotely bytelehealth. 297,329 -331,333 involving demonstrated that10 weeks of hands-on parent trainingin joint attention, symbolic play,engagement and regulation (an NDBI)was superior to a parent-onlypsychoeducational intervention forincreasing joint engagement. 338A parent training approach may be usedto promote compliance withinstruction, social communication,and other identi ed goals of the caregiver, such as reducingmaladaptive behaviors. 331,339 -342 Including parents in the interventionprocess is critically important. 43,326,343 Educational Interventions Classroom-Based Models It is the expectation that school-aged children will be educated inclassroom settings with supports fora broad effect on the symptoms of ASD and associated de cits. Educating students with ASD in the least restrictive environment typicallyrequires an individualized programthat is modi ed to meet the Individualized Education Program(IEP) goals set by the family, student,and school team. Some students who do not qualify for an IEP by educational criteria may besupported with accommodationsthrough a Section 504 plan or withclassroom-level accommodations.Many students with ASD are educatedin inclusive classrooms withsupports. Other school-aged children and youth bene t from disorder- speci c approaches. Examples of classroom-based models include Learning Experiences and AlternativePrograms for Preschoolers and theirParents (LEAP) and TEACCH. 344 LEAP blends principles of ABA with special and general education teaching techniques for elementary-aged pupils in inclusive settings forteaching social interaction. 344 -346An RCT of 294 preschool-aged childrenrevealed that LEAP was associatedwith improvement in socialization, cognition, language, and challenging behavior and that LEAP was superiorto a treatment-as-usual method. 345 TEACCH class settings are visuallyorganized to promote engagementand learning. 344The TEACCH approach to skill acquisition includesassessment-based curriculumdevelopment and an emphasis onstructure, including predictableorganization of activities and use of visual schedules, organization of the physical environment to optimizelearning and avoid frustration (eg, byminimizing distractions and/orsensory dysregulation), andadaptation and organization ofmaterials and tasks to promoteindependence from adult directions or prompts. 344,347Instruction is organized in a predictable fashion and uses visual schedules withpromotion of independence inactivities planned into theinstruction. 347This approach is associated with a small, butmeasurable, bene t in perceptual, motor, verbal, and cognitive skills instudents with ASD, with lessmeasured effect on adaptive andmotor function 347and challenging behaviors. Rigorous studies ofeducational interventions forstudents with ASD at school age andbeyond are necessary to understand the effectiveness of different models. 298 A comparison of the effects of LEAPand TEACCH classrooms with those of standard special education classes taught by teachers familiar with ASDrevealed that the common features ofthese interventions may beresponsible for improvements seen inall students. TEACCH was associatedwith more reported improvement inASD severity for students who had greater cognitive delays. This nding may speak to the bene t of theenvironmental and behavioral supports. 344Research interventions may not be comparable withcommunity-provided schoolprograms. Future research is needed to address how best to provide evidence-based intervention inclassroom settings. Education in the Least Restrictive Educational Environment Pediatricians have an important role in advocating for children and youth with special health care needs, including ASD, in the educationalsetting. Students have a right to a freeand appropriate public education.Educational programs for school-agedchildren with ASD should promotelanguage, academic, adaptive, andsocial skills development and prepare them for postsecondary education or employment. 348Most, but not all, students with ASD will have someindividualization of their educationunder the guidance of an IEPdetermined by the schoolmultidisciplinary team in conjunctionwith the family. Others may receive accommodation and/or environmental modi cations under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Actof 1973. 349A medical diagnosis of ASD alone does not automaticallytranslate into eligibility for school-based services. Functionalimpairment that affects participation in the typical curriculum is required to qualify for supports in theeducational setting and may lead toan IEP for the educational handicap ofautism. Most youth with ASD andaverage-range intelligence will likelyrequire academic interventionbecause of coexisting learning disabilities, executive function challenges, ADHD, motor processingdecits, the effects of their pragmatic language differences on reading andwriting, and/or challenges incomprehension of spoken or writtenlanguage. 350Attention to the needs of the individual student must be central to the IEP process. Social skills of students with ASD may bene t 24 FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS by guest on August 26, 2021 www.aappublications.org/news Downloaded from from students being in class and on the playground with peers withtypical development. 351,352However, spending more than 75% of theirtime in an inclusive educational setting alone was not suf cient in transition-aged youth to increase rates of college attendance, highschool graduation, or functionalratings. 353How to best support students with ASD in the leastrestricted environment requiresfurther study. Social Skills Instruction Social skills de cits may present differently depending on languageabilities, developmental level, andage. Examples of social skills de cits include the following: challenges with entering,sustaining, and exiting interactions; difculty attending to, understanding, and usingnonverbal and verbal social cues,such as eye contact, facialexpressions, and gestures; difculty in understanding \"unwritten \"social rules of environment; understanding the perspectiveof others; struggling with negotiation,compromise, and confl ict resolution; and problems with interactive play orparticipation in leisure activities. The importance of caregiverinvolvement in teaching social skillsto preschool-aged children needs tobe emphasized for families of youngchildren with ASD. Reinforcing socialinteraction is central to the success ofevidence-based ABA, developmental,and NDBI approaches. 296,354Teaching and coaching social interactioninvolves both behavioral therapy andspeech and language therapyapproaches. School-aged children and adolescents with ASD, including those with typical academic skills, should have socialskills support considered in theirschool and perhaps in othertherapeutic settings if indicated. 351,354 -356Although families identify the need to address social skill developments in settings outside of school, the success of these types of interventions is variable. Interventions may be divided into adult-mediated (skill building withthe individual child), peer-mediated (skill building with the child and typically developing classmates), and mixed approaches. Child-directed social skills interventions are oftendelivered individually or in small groups with other children with similar needs. Therapy may be provided in behavioral health settings to complement the social skillsinterventions at school. Interventions addressing social skills may increase the child 'sk n o w l e d g e of the cues for social behavior and teach strategies for social problem- solving. A popular method uses thesocial narrative to help a child de ne the social context of an anticipatedor experienced situation, put it in perspective, and then develop statements on how it makes the childf e e la n do nw h a tt od oi nr e s p o n s et o the event and feelings. 357This coached rehearsal strategy may beincluded within other programmatic approaches. Implementation mayuse a cognitive behavioral intervention strategy in which the child identi es feelings and thoughts and learns to substitute moresocially appropriate alternatives. 354 Video- and computer-based social skill interventions may extend access to intervention once an evidence base is established. A systematic review of RCTs of social skillstraining for children aged 6 to 21 years revealed that interventions improved social competence and friendship quality but did not result in differences in emotionalrecognition and social communication. Transfer of skills to other settings was inconsistent. 356Because child-mediated interventionstaught separately from social settings have not had consistentlybenecial effects, interventions have been developed for implementationin the social settings that includepeers, such as the classroom and playground. These interventions demonstrate improved playgroundinteraction between children with and without ASD and improved identi cation as friends by typical peers. 351Peer-mediated intervention for students with ASD have revealedimproved social connectedness andreduced social isolation and provideevidence to support the use of these interventions in the classroom and playground. An evidence-basedapproach designed for group administration, the Program for the Education and Enrichment ofRelational Skills, may improve both teacher-reported social functioning and adolescent-reported socialcognition. 358Fewer studies are available to guide programs topromote social skills developmentfor adults with ASD. However, the Program for the Education and Enrichment of Relational Skillsgroup model has been demonstratedto improve social skills in young adults with ASD. 359 Families should be counseled to include development of social skills with discrete goals and interventions in the IEP or educational plan aswell as to be cognizant of potential opportunities to promote social interaction in the naturalenvironment and in the context of other therapies. 360Implementing IEP goals across the day and generalizing speci c skills to promote conversation and nonverbalcommunication, such as providingeye contact, directing facial expressions, and using appropriate gestures, is important, independentof age, and should involve boththe caregivers and professionals.

Other Therapeutic Interventions Speech and Language Interventions Delayed language is an early concern for many children who are laterdiagnosed with ASD. Thecommunication symptoms included in the DSM-5 criteria for ASD re flect core de cits in social communication and interaction, such as failure of back-and-forth communication,decits in nonverbal communication (such as eye gaze and use of gesture),difculty adjusting behavior to suit the social context, and restricted and repetitive behaviors leading to perseverative vocalization, echolalia,and preoccupation with restrictedtopics of interest. All children withASD should have documentation ofspeci c coexisting speech and language diagnoses so thatappropriate intervention might be provided. Speech-language therapy is the most commonly identi ed intervention provided for children with ASD. 361 The strategies used by speech-language pathologists to reinforcesound repetition and word use inchildren with typical development areoften initially used with young children with ASD. Such strategies include reinforcement of speechsounds and communicative acts,imitation of the sounds the childmakes, and exaggerated imitation andslowed tempo. 362The literature offers the most support forapproaches with preverbal children with ASD in which adult prompts are used for communication, promptfading, and reinforcement of theirown attempts at communication.Intervention in naturalistic settingsand involvement of caregivers mayhelp reinforce the initiation ofcommunication and functional use of sounds, gestures, and words. A signi cant minority (up to 30%) of individuals with ASD ultimately do not acquire verbal speech. 363Delayedonset of speech may be complicatedby general delays in development(intellectual disabilities) or coexistingspeech disorders, such as childhoodapraxia of speech. Although using communicative spoken phrases before age 4 years is considereda good prognostic sign for languagedevelopment in youth with ASD,emergence of phrase speech mayoccur to at least age 10 years,especially in children with preservednonverbal skills and evidence of social engagement. 364 When children do not spontaneously speak, augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) may be introduced. Examples of AACstrategies include sign language, thePicture Exchange CommunicationSystem, and speech-generatingdevices. 365,366The use of AAC may help promote social interaction andunderstanding of the purpose of communication and does not delay onset of speech. Indeed, it mayenhance emergence of spoken wordsby pairing nonverbal and verbalcommunication. The Picture Exchange Communication System is used to buildcommunication through pictureidenti cation and exchange as communication. With training,pictures can be sequenced to build oncommunicaiton. 367Picture strips that sequentially explain medicalprocedures, for example, takeadvantage of this approach. Use ofspeech-generating devices andprograms that use AAC on digitaltablets also are increasing. Thesedevices provide acoustic feedback tothe child, and touch-screen tablets are relatively inexpensive and portable. Medical providers are often asked tojustify the purchase of touch-screentablets or AAC devices. It cannot beassumed that the use of AAC alonewill lead to functional oralcommunication without a therapeuticplan. 368Current scienti c evidence does not support the use of facilitatedcommunication in which a nonverbalindividual is guided tocommunicate. 369,370This differs from AAC, in which the individual is taughtto communicate independently.Future strategies to promote communication are expected to incorporate evolving knowledgeabout sensory processing andconnectivity of brain functions inpeople with ASD. Children and youth with ASD often have de cits in pragmatic language that can affect social interaction withadults and peers and academicperformance as more complexlanguage becomes required forreading comprehension and analysis of information. In addition, literal interpretation of language anddifculty in understanding the intent of other people leads to behavioralchallenges in some people with ASDand affects success in school, leisureactivities, and employment. School-aged students with spoken language should have their pragmatic language assessed as part of their school-related reevaluations, withconsideration of pragmatic languagetesting if academic problems andinattention are noted in theclassroom. Interventions may includeindividual and group approaches that include teaching and practicing conversation. The pediatrician mayrefer the child for private speech-language therapy if he or she is noteligible for services in school or ifincreased intensity of intervention isdesired. Although the impact ofspeech-language therapy on structural language improvement has not been adequately studied,improvement in ratings ofconversational competence byparents and of classroom learningskills by teachers supports therecommendation for social skills andsocial language interventions for students with ASD. 371 Motor Therapies Children with ASD may have low muscle tone or a developmental 26 FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS by guest on August 26, 2021 www.aappublications.org/news Downloaded from coordination disorder. Although the ages for sitting and walking do notdiffer between children with ASD and children with typical development, both ne and gross motor skills may be delayed in preschool-aged children with ASD. 372 Attention to position in space inchildren with a coexisting diagnosis of ADHD may further complicatedelays in coordination. 373 Occupational therapy services maybe indicated to promote ne motor and adaptive skills, including self-care, toy use, and handwriting.Almost two-thirds of preschool-aged children with ASD are reported to receive occupational therapy services. 374 Similarly, some children with ASD may have gross motor impairmenton formal testing that may bene t from therapeutic interventionfocused on building strength, coordination, motor planning, or skill acquisition to promote safermobility or play. Toe walking is common among children with ASD as well as in other developmental disorders in early childhood. The etiology of toe walking in ASD isunclear, although sensory aversion and habit or perseveration have been proposed. Common interventions for toe walking may include passive stretching, orthotics,and casting. Impairment in gross motor function may affect the capacity of a child with ASD to participate in leisure activities with the family or with peers and mayimpair participation in sports or interactive play beyond the effect of their social skills alone. Impaired motor skills may further decrease opportunities for social skillsdevelopment and active learning and may be a risk factor for overweight and obesity. 375For motor therapies to be provided in the educationalsetting, a signi cant delay for age that affects function in school must be identi ed on a valid assessment measure.Sensory Therapies In 2012, the AAP published a clinical report, \"Sensory Integration Therapies for Children With Developmental and BehavioralDisorders, \"providing important background information andrecommendations forpediatricians. 376Since that publication, the DSM-5 criteria now includes sensory symptoms in the diagnostic criteria for ASD inrecognition of the fact that individualswith ASD have sensory challengesthat may be related to repetitive andother challenging behaviors. 377 Indeed, sensory symptoms exhibitedby young children, such as food selectivity, covering their ears for certain sounds, and visual scrutiny ofaspects of objects, may be among theearliest differences families identifyin their children 's development. Sensory goals may be included intreatment objectives for studentswith ASD. Adult-directed approaches provided through sensory-based interventions may be included in thecontext of motor and behavioraltherapies and in educational settings.Despite the increasing scienti c understanding of the neurobiologicalbasis for sensory symptoms inindividuals with ASD, empirical interventions in common practice have modest evidence to supporttheir general use at this time. 378 Commonly used sensory-basedinterventions, including brushing ofthe skin, proprioceptive stimulationby using weighted vests, orkinesthetic stimulation (such as swinging or use of specialized seating, such as a therapy ball, to modulatelevel of arousal), are not yetsupported in the peer-reviewedliterature. Proponents of sensory integration therapies distinguish them frominterventions with sensory modalitiesbecause of the active engagementwith the child in skill building or desensitization. This type of therapy requires a trained clinician, often anoccupational therapist, to work witha child by using play and sensoryactivities to reinforce adaptiveresponses. The therapist explains thechild 's behaviors and responses to caregivers in sensory terms andprovides them with strategies to helpthe caregivers accommodate thechild 's sensory needs to decrease functional impairment and tolerateenvironmental triggers. Advocates ofthese interventions claim thatdysfunction in integration of sensory input contributes to inef ciencies in learning and to behavioral challenges and that therapeutic approaches tosensory integration need to beconsidered separately from focalsensory-based treatments. 379 Although sensory-based therapies areamong the most commonly requested therapies by caregivers, 361the evidence supporting their general use remains currently limited.378,379As with any other intervention, speci c goals for sensory-based therapiesshould be identi ed, and outcomes should be monitored so that theutility for any given child can be documented. 376 Medical Management of Co-occurring Conditions Co-occurring medical and other conditions, such as seizures, sleepdisorders, gastrointestinal (GI)disorders, feeding disorders, obesity,catatonia, and others, havea signi cant effect on the health and quality of life for children and youthwith ASD and their families. 380,381In this section, the co-existing conditionscommonly observed in children andyouth with ASD are described, andanticipatory guidance andmanagement strategies that primarycare providers may consider are provided. 380 Seizures There is both an increased risk for ASD among children and youth withepilepsy and an increased risk for seizures in those with ASD. The pooled risk for ASD among children PEDIATRICS Volume 145, number 1, January 2020 27 by guest on August 26, 2021 www.aappublications.org/news Downloaded from with epilepsy is 6.3%, with almost 5 times as many in samples with thehighest rates of co-occurringintellectual disabilities. 173,382,383The rate of seizures among people with ASD in community-based populations has been reported to range from 7%to 23%, with rates as high as 46%reported in clinically ascertainedsamples. 170It has been suggested that the risk for seizures is notincreased in individuals with ASDwithout intellectual disability. Risk factors for the increased likelihood of seizures in people with ASD includeintellectual disability (as noted),female sex, and lower gestationalage. 174Speci c genetic disorders associated with ASD, such as tuberoussclerosis, also may contribute toseizure risk in early childhood. Onset is bimodally distributed, with most rst seizures occurring in early childhood and in adolescence; 20% ofrst seizures occur in adults with ASD. 170Children with ASD and seizures tend to have more behavioralchallenges, independent of cognitiveskills. 382Screening EEGs are not recommended for patients who areasymptomatic. An overnight EEGshould be considered when theclinical history suggests seizures andatypical regression. Response toconventional antiepileptic drugtherapy varies greatly, with somereports suggesting an increased risk for treatment-resistant epilepsy in individuals with early onset ofseizures and delayed globaldevelopment. 384 GI Symptoms GI symptoms, such as abdominal pain,constipation, diarrhea, gastroesophageal re flux, and feeding problems, are more commonly reported in children and adolescentswith ASD than in those withdevelopmental delay or typicaldevelopment. 385 -387A large prospective cohort study revealeddifferences as early as 6 to 18 months of age in stooling patterns and feeding behaviors in children whowere later diagnosed with ASD. 388 Because of language delays and atypical sensory perception or reportof pain, individuals with ASD may beless likely to report speci cG I discomfort and may present withagitation, sleep disruption, or otherbehavioral symptoms rather than GIdiscomfort. 387Characteristics of ASD that might affect GI symptoms includeresistance to change (feeding andconstipation), comorbid anxiety(pain, feeding, and motilitydisorders), 389and altered sensory perception (pain, feeding, andconstipation). At present, there is noevidence of an association of ASDwith celiac disease, speci c immune dysfunction, or motility disorders (eg,gastroesophageal re flux) in children with ASD. It would be expected that these disorders would occur at least as frequently among individuals withASD as among individuals in thegeneral population, and they shouldbe considered when the child hasa history of GI symptoms or a changein behavior. 390,391Ongoing research is focused on whether differences arepresent in immunologic function,motility, or the microbiome inindividuals with ASD. 392 -394 Selective eating is common in children with ASD.386A limited diet may in fluence GI symptoms, such as constipation,395and alter the intestinal microbiota. GI disorders should be considered in patients withASD if they present with typical GIsymptoms or with agitation, foodrefusal, or sleep disturbance. 387,396 The indicated GI workup will dependon the speci c symptoms. Children with ASD should be offered the sameapproaches to treatment of GIdisorders as other children.Modi cations of conventional interventions to accommodate forsymptoms of ASD might includeconsistent behaviorally informedapproaches for constipation andencopresis.Feeding Disorders Up to three-quarters of children with ASD have problems related to eating, including food selectivity based ontexture, color, or temperature; ritualsaround food presentation; andcompulsive eating of certainfoods. 397 -399Behavioral refusal may also present as the child holding foodin the mouth, volitional gagging, and emesis. Common related problems pica nonfood items)and rumination (self-stimulatoryemesis and reswallowing of stomachcontents). By age 16 months, childrenwho are later diagnosed with ASD areobserved to be more selective in theireating patterns than are other toddlers. 400Problems around mealtime behavior and food choice often persist into adolescence. Thefrequency of feeding challenges inchildren and youth with ASD mayrelate to the core symptoms ofrestrictive and repetitive behaviorand differences in sensory perception related to smell, taste, and texture. 401 Children with developmental delays may also have delayed oral motorskill development and may demonstrate food refusal of textures that they cannot physically chew orswallow. Discomfort can lead to foodrefusal, so initial evaluation shouldinclude consideration ofgastroesophageal re flux, dental pain, food allergies, lactose intolerance, andsignicant constipation. 387If oral- motor concerns are observed, speechor occupational therapy assessment isindicated. Because feeding problems are so common among children with ASD, a dietary history should be obtained at health supervision visits.Physiologic needs for macronutrientsand micronutrients are the same forchildren with ASD as for otherchildren. As with other children in theUnited States, insuf cient intake of ber, vitamin D, and calcium are common. 402Rare cases of severe nutritional de ciencies, such as 28 FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS by guest on August 26, 2021 www.aappublications.org/news Downloaded from rickets (vitamin D),403scurvy (vitamin C),404and keratoconus (vitamin A),405have been reported in children with ASD with severe food aversions. If supplements are used to correct for poor vitamin D or calcium intake, it is important to con rm that the dose is suf cient for the age and sex of the child.406Food forti cation in the United States may supplyadequate amounts of vitamins andminerals for some children withselective diets, so additional multivitamins may not be necessary. 407Consultation with a registered dietitian may be helpfulto be able to guide families regardingthe nutritional suf ciency of their child 's diet. The clinician can counsel familiesabout offering children routine mealsand snacks, discouraging snackingthrough the day, promoting self-feeding, and using basic behavioralapproaches to encourage mealtime structure and predictability with minimal distraction. Children withASD need to be offered new foodsmultiple times to become familiarwith them. Feeding problems thataffect nutrition or family function orthat are specialized, such as mouthpacking, rumination, severe pica, and intense aversions, are likely to need the support of professionals withexpertise in behavior managementand/or oral-motor therapies (speechor occupational therapy). 408,409Food refusal may stem from discomfort, soconsultation with a gastroenterologistmay be helpful. Gastrostomy-tube placement and nonoral feeding should only be considered afterappropriate behavioral interventionhas failed. Obesity Children and youth with ASD havegreater risk for overweight andobesity than those in the generalpopulation. 410 -413People with ASD have fewer opportunities and perhaps less interest for active leisure or organized sports, have repetitiveeating patterns that may includeenergy-dense foods, and are morelikely to be prescribed medications,such as atypical neuroleptics (orantipsychotic medication) and anticonvulsants, that often contribute to excessive weight gain. Sleepdisorders may further predisposethem for obesity. Primary careproviders should monitor a child 's age-speci c BMI percentile in the context of health supervision care andaddress modi able risk factors through anticipatory guidance fortheir patients with ASD. Programsthat address healthy weight forchildren and youth with typicaldevelopment may need to bemodi ed for successful use for patients with ASD. 414 Dental Health Children with ASD commonly haveunmet dental needs. Dif culty cooperating with hygiene andprofessional care are reportedbarriers for dental care. Even wheninsurance coverage is available,children with ASD have fewer visits for routine care. 415There are limited data about the prevalence of caries or gingival disease in children with ASD.As with other children, anticipatoryguidance should include attention todental hygiene and fluoride use, if appropriate, from a young age.Behavioral strategies may be helpful to prevent the need for dental care under sedation. Pica Children and youth with ASD may putnonfood items in their mouths longafter the developmental period ofearly childhood, when pica is expected. Pica is reported in up to one-quarter of preschool-agedchildren with ASD and is documentedto persist in individuals withintellectual disability. 416,417The persistence of pica may beattributable to sensory differences,perseveration or obsession, and oral exploration of the environment. Clinicians need to be aware ofpersistence of pica in children andyouth with ASD because of the riskfor toxic ingestions, risk for leadintoxication, potential for infection,and the risk for mechanical ingestions ranging from batteries to bezoars. 418 Obstruction and perforation need to be considered in children with picawho have acute abdominalsymptoms. Iron de ciency is associated with pica in the generalpopulation. 419Laboratory monitoring of blood lead and iron de ciency in children with pica is suggested in thecontext of primary care. Behavioralintervention includes reinforcingappropriate behaviors, ensuring adultsupervision, and putting into placeenvironmental safeguards forprevention. Sleep Problems Sleep disturbance is common inindividuals with ASD and may beassociated with exacerbation ofproblematic daytime behavior. 420 -427 Problems with initiating andmaintaining sleep are reported for50% to 80% of children with ASD. 428 Children who are later diagnosedwith ASD are reported to have hadsleep problems by 30 months ofage. 429Sleep problems in individuals with ASD persist; almost half ofadolescents with ASD continue tohave sleep symptoms. 430Adolescents are more likely to have shorter sleep duration, daytime sleepiness, and delayed sleep onset compared withyounger children with ASD, who aremore likely to have bedtimeresistance, parasomnias, and night-waking. Reasons for the increasedfrequency of sleep disturbances inchildren and youth with ASD may include differences in melatonin metabolism, 431developmental disruption of other neurotransmittersystems critical to sleep, and lack ofsocial expectations, among otherexplanations. Genetic disorders, suchas Smith-Magenis syndrome, areassociated with both ASD and sleep disruption. 432Biological reasons for disrupted sleep that are not unique to PEDIATRICS Volume 145, number 1, January 2020 29 by guest on August 26, 2021 www.aappublications.org/news Downloaded from children with ASD may include restless leg syndrome, which may beassociated with low iron stores, 433 and coexisting neurologic orbehavioral diagnoses, such asepilepsy, anxiety, ADHD, or mood disorders. The most common cause of both delayed sleep onset and night wakings are learned behaviors. As with other children, the evaluation ofthe child with ASD with delayed sleep onset, night wakings, and/or early-morning wakings should include a history of comorbid medical conditions that mightdisrupt sleep, such as gastroesophageal re flux, seizures, asthma, allergies, eczema, orenuresis. Snoring might suggest obstructive sleep apnea and wouldprompt referral for additional assessment. Children who play video games or engage in other screen time close to bedtime have later bedtimes and may have more dif culty falling asleep. 434,435Restless sleep and night wakings would suggest a needfor laboratory evaluation for ferritin and other indicators of iron sufciency to determine if low iron stores might be present. 428An environmental history of thehousehold may help to determine if household noise, parental work hours, or other factors may affectsleep. The bedtime routine and response to night-waking should be reviewed to determine the behavioral approaches to consider. Empirical support exists for the effectiveness of parent education andbehavioral interventions for children with ASD and sleep disturbances. 425,436 -440Behavioral intervention includes parentsestablishing bedtime routines andmaking clear their expectation that the child sleeps in his or her own bed. This may be dif cult to establish for children with ASD, who may notappreciate the social conventionsaround sleep time and may have repetitive rituals and comorbid anxiety or ADHD. Despite thesechallenges, behavioral strategies aresuccessful when consistentlyimplemented. 440 No medication is currently approvedby the US Food and DrugAdministration for the treatment ofinsomnia in children with or withoutASD. Any medication elected shouldbe started at a low dose and monitored for adverse effects. 427 Sleep onset may be aided by treatment with melatonin441,442at doses from 1 to 6 mg443and may be maintained with long-actingmelatonin. 442Adverse effects are uncommon may clonidine) and antihistamines (eg,diphenhydramine) with sleep onset orto address night-waking in children,but the literature provides littlesupport for their use. 444,445 Disordered sleep is associated withchallenging daytime behaviors in children with ASD 446; addressing one may help with the other. Wandering Accidents, including drowning, are a major cause of morbidity andmortality in children and youth withdevelopmental disabilities, includingASD. 447,448Children and youth with ASD may have decreased awarenessof social convention and community rules as well as impulsivity and perseverative interests that drawthem to potential dangers, such asbodies of water and busy roads.Wandering off (also calledelopement) places them at risk forinjury. Wandering, if present, shouldbe included in the problem list as a coexisting diagnosis in patients with ASD. In an online study, 1218 familiesof children with ASD were questionedabout elopement. 447Nearly half of children with ASD between the agesof 4 and 10 years had tried to elope.Almost half of those children weremissing long enough for their parents to contact the police. Of those children, approximately two-thirdswere at risk for traf c-related injury and almost one-third were reportedto have had near-drowning episodes.Data from a national survey revealedthat elopement attempts in the past year were reported by approximately one-third of parents whose childrenhad ASD with or without intellectualdisability. 449Wandering may persist into adulthood. In the survey by Anderson et al,447 parents reported that the most common perceived reasons forelopement were enjoyment ofrunning, attempts to get to a desiredlocation (such as a park), pursuit of an intense interest (eg, water), and escape from situations or sensoryevents that made them anxious.Because the risk for elopementincreases with the severity of ASDand with co-occurring intellectualdisabilities, many of the individuals atgreatest risk have limited language and cannot tell rst responders their names, addresses, or phone numbers if they get lost. Police may interpretaggression caused by fear ascombative behavior. Prevention is the most important intervention for elopement. Parentsparticipating in a large nationalsurvey of children with special healthcare needs reported primarily usingphysical and electronic barriers to tryto prevent elopement, especially in children who also had intellectual disabilities. 447,449Information on prevention and management ofwandering is available for parentsand clinicians (http://nationalautismassociation.org/big-red-safety-box/). Consistent,adequate adult supervision is important in all environments: school, home, and community settings.Families note that increasedsupervision needs result in increasedfamily stress. Families may need toconsider deadbolts, fencing, andalarm systems for safety as well aspersonal devices and identi cation bracelets or other identi cation. Local law enforcement 30 FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS by guest on August 26, 2021 www.aappublications.org/news Downloaded from agencies may support GPS tracking. Alerting neighbors and local lawenforcement of cials as well as securing pools in the neighborhoodand creating a family emergency plan are suggested. If impulsivity and motor hyperactivity contribute toelopement, examining the utility ofmedication as part of an overall planmay be considered. Similarly,addressing sleep issues becomesimportant if the child is at risk forwandering at night. Teaching safety skills and appropriate community behaviors is critical to prevention. Allchildren with ASD, no matter theirlevel of cognitive skills, are at risk forwandering. 449 Motor Disorders There is increasing appreciation thatindividuals with ASD may havedevelopmental coordination disorderand other neurologic problems. Tic disorders occur with an increased frequency in children with ASD. 450 Distinguishing complex tics fromstereotyped movements may bechallenging. Catatonia was added as a possible coexisting condition to ASD in theDSM-5. Slow initiation of movementand reported deterioration in motorperformance have been treated withlorazepam, electroconvulsive therapy,and behavioral interventions, but the therapies do not have a strongliterature base. 451Later loss of motor skills in adolescence should prompt evaluation by a neurologist forunderlying reasons. Regression inlanguage or social interest is reported in approximately one-quarter of children later diagnosed with ASD. Itis recognized most commonlybetween 18 and 24 months of age.Regression later in childhoodrequires evaluation. Co-occurring Behavioral Health Conditions Co-occurring behavioral symptoms include hyperactivity or inattention,aggression, outbursts, and self-injurious behaviors. Although thesebehaviors are not core features ofASD, they commonly interfere withfunctioning in school, at home, and in the community and contribute substantially to the challenges facedby families. 293,294,381,452 -457 Psychiatric conditions (such as ADHD,anxiety, OCD, mood disorders,conduct disorders, or others) areidenti ed in 70% to 90% of children and youth with ASD. 458,459Behavioral challenges have a signi cant effect on health and quality of life for childrenand adolescents with ASD and theirfamilies. 460Patients with ASD, like other children and adolescents,should be regularly screened forbehavioral and/or emotionalconditions, as recommended by the AAP. 461The effect of behavior onhome and school functioning is often assessed as part of school testing byusing parent and teacherquestionnaires, such as the BehaviorAssessment System for Children, Third Edition, Parent Rating Scales, 79,462or the Child Behavior Checklist.82,463,464 With change in behavioral symptoms, physical sources of discomfort and behavioral intervention should beconsidered. 465If behavioral interventions are insuf cient to address the challenges or areunavailable at the time, medicationmight be considered (see Table 10 forguidance on prescribing medication). ADHD Changes in DSM-5 criteria have provided flexibility to diagnose other DSM-5 disorders in addition to ASD, which can help guide treatment.Approximately half of children andyouth with ASD also may ful ll diagnostic criteria for ADHD. 459 Pediatricians should keep in mindthat some children who are later diagnosed with ASD may have been initially identi ed as having ADHD. 69 Symptoms of ADHD may furthercompromise social skills function inchildren with ASD because ofinattention to social cues andimpulsivity. Standard rating scalesused to assess symptoms of ADHD have not yet been validated for TABLE 10 Considerations Surrounding Medication Use No current medication corrects core social and communication symptoms of ASD Accurate diagnosis of coexisting psychiatric conditions guide therapy Medication is used to help manage \u0081Coexisting behavioral health disorders (eg, ADHD, mood disorders, or anxiety disorders) \u0081Associated problem behaviors or symptoms causing signi cant impairment and distress o Examples include the following: aggression, self-injurious behavior, sleep disturbance, mood lability, anxiety, hyperactivity, impulsivity, inattention Medication should only be considered after \u0081Careful accounting of when the behavior started and what seems to exacerbate it \u0081A functional behavioral assessment should guide development of a treatment plan in the school setting o Consider whether the behavior serves as communication of distress or refusal \u0081Consider referral to a behavior therapist outside of school to assess the reasons for the behavior, provide the family with strategies, and collaborate in care \u0081Careful history and physical to look for medical factors that may cause or exacerbate challenging behaviors (eg, gastroesophageal re flux and acute sources of pain, such as otitis media, dental injury, fracture, and others)34,380,391,485,579 Consider medication after treatable medical conditions and behavioral factors assessed and intervention does not address the symptoms of concernInclude the family and patient in shared decision making that considers their goals and values 543 PEDIATRICS Volume 145, number 1, January 2020 31 by guest on August 26, 2021 www.aappublications.org/news Downloaded from individuals with ASD. However, they are useful in determining the clinicalimpact of symptoms for an individualpatient and in monitoring treatment.It is important, however, to consider the differential diagnosis of inattention and hyperactivity in thecontext of the language impairmentand perseverative focus that oftenaccompanies ASD. Children withdelayed language may appear moreinattentive. If they are expected toperform activities (including schoolwork) that they are not able to understand or accomplish, a childwith ASD may engage in behaviors toescape, which can be interpreted asinattention and hyperactivity. Patientswith ASD may be focused on theirperseverative interests and may beinternally distracted, as opposed to distracted by the environment. Evaluation of the symptom ofinattention or impulsivity includesassessing language and educationalabilities. Appropriate educationalmodi cations and use of language for instruction that the student canunderstand are critical for successful intervention. Behavioral strategies should address reinforcement of on-task behaviors, breaking down tasksinto units that can be completedsuccessfully, breaks for activity (oftenincluded in sensory activities), andadult supervision appropriate for thedemands. The same medications that are used for symptoms of ADHD in children without ASD are used insimilar doses for children withASD. 466Routine monitoring is important because children with ASDmay be at greater risk for adverseeffects 467(Table 11). The evaluation of a child for a possible co-occurring diagnosis of ADHD also should include consideration of a co-occurring diagnosis of anxiety. 464,466 Anxiety Disorders The DSM-5 classi cation system separates anxiety disorders intoseparation anxiety disorder, selective mutism, speci c phobia, social phobia, panic disorder, agoraphobia,and generalized anxiety disorder as well as unspeci ed anxiety disorder. As many as 40% to 66% of school-aged children and adults with ASDare reported to also have anxiety disorders. 458,459Anxiety disorders are most commonly identi ed in children with ASD and typical cognitive and language abilities.468,469 Symptoms may be present in earlychildhood and manifest as behavioralchallenges, such as overreactivity.Biological predisposition to both ASD and anxiety may be attributable to common genetic factors and/oraltered neurophysiologic responses tostress. 470 Core symptoms of ASD decrease theability of individuals with ASD topredict the actions or interpret thebeliefs of others, which may lead toa constant state of heightened worry.Repetitive behaviors may, in part,serve to instill predictability, so anxiety may lead to increased stereotyped behaviors orperseverative thoughts. Evaluation ofanxiety requires consideration of thelanguage demands of theenvironment, academic expectations,social demands, and underlying fearsor phobias. Youth with ASD may lack sufcient language or insight to describe their symptoms. Getting information from multiple sourcesand looking at the behavioralmanifestations related to context willhelp to correctly identify anxiety inpatients with ASD. 471 Strong evidence from RCTs supportsthe use of cognitive behavioraltherapy for anxiety symptoms inschool-aged children with ASD,especially those with typical-range intelligence. 295,298,472 -475Anxiety may be associated with reported GI and sensory symptoms.389Some individuals nd that sensory redirection or sensory activities usedin the context of a behavioralprogram are helpful to diminishfeelings of anxiety. Other individuals maynd symptom relief with the introduction of routine and structureif anxiety is exacerbated by uncertainty or associated withsensory under- and overreactivity. 377 Nonpharmacologic approaches, suchas neurofeedback and delivered approaches to self- regulation, are being evaluated fortheir therapeutic potential.Medications used for anxiety in thegeneral population may beconsidered as part of an overalltreatment plan for children and youthwith ASD (see Table 11 for psychopharmacotherapy of children with ASD and anxiety). Mood Disorders Depressive disorders are morecommon among children and adultswith ASD than in the generalpopulation. Reported rates of coexisting depression in adults and children are highly variable, rangingfrom 12% to 33%. 458,476,477 Symptoms of depression are morelikely to lead to dual mental healthand developmental disabilitydiagnoses in adolescents and adultswith ASD than in children. The coexistence of mood disorders and ASD may be associated with geneticand neurobiological factors as well asenvironmental factors related tochronic stress and dif culty with understanding social situations. Bothelevated and depressed mood maypresent as behavioral symptoms in youth with ASD. Changes in affect, participation, sleep habits, and eatingmay be symptoms of an underlyingmood disorder. Attempted suicide isreported to occur more frequently inpeople with ASD than in the generalpopulation. Risk factors include peervictimization, behavioral problems, minority race or ethnicity, male sex, lower socioeconomic status, andlower level of education. 478The AAP recommends screening fordepression in patients older than12 years. Until ASD-speci c measures are developed, the same approachesused for all other adolescents at increased risk for depression should be considered. 479 32 FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS by guest on August 26, 2021 www.aappublications.org/news Downloaded from TABLE 11 Psychotropic Medication Options for Common Target Symptoms Target Symptoms Medication Class (Examples) Comments Hyperactivity medication may not appear as effective SNRIs (atomoxetine)588-590May be more sensitive to adverse effects persist, trial of medication management \u0081Start with a low-dose stimulant (eg, methylphenidate or mixed dextroamphetamine salts) and increase as neededand tolerated May be most effective in children without comorbid intellectual disability Targets symptoms of impulsivity and hyperactivity \u0081If there are adverse effects or if not effective: Consider atomoxetine, especially if also with social anxietyConsider a-2 agonists (eg, decrease hyperactivity;

Riddle MA. Pediatric Psychopharmacology for Primary Care . 1st ed. Elk Grove Village, IL: American Academy of Pediatrics; 2016. 34 FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS by guest on August 26, 2021 www.aappublications.org/news Downloaded from As in children and youth with typical development, assessment ofdepression and other mood disordersmust include family history, history ofenvironmental stressors, the potentialfor toxic ingestions, and evaluationfor comorbid conditions. Interventions for depression include supportive therapy, cognitivebehavioral therapy, and medication, ifindicated, as coordinatedinterventions (see Table 11 formedication use). Antidepressant usein people with ASD has not beendemonstrated to address aggression and has inconsistent effect on anxiety. 480Medication recommendations are based on datafrom the general pediatric populationand expert consensus. 469 The DSM-5 criteria for bipolar illnessinclude changes in activity, energy,and mood. It may be dif cult to make a diagnosis in people with ASD with limited language. The co-occurrence of bipolar illness and ASD inindividuals with typical intelligenceranges from 6% to 21%. 481Lifetime diagnosis of bipolar illness in adultswith ASD is reported to be 9%. 458 OCD-Related Disorders Although restricted and repetitivebehaviors are symptoms of ASD,some individuals with ASD may alsohave coexisting OCD. Obsessions are recurrent, unwanted, and persistent thoughts, images, or urges that causedistress. Compulsions are repetitivebehaviors or thoughts with rigid rulesperformed to reduce anxiety. Unlikethe stereotypic behaviors of ASD,compulsions usually follow an obsession, diminish anxiety, and arenot desired by the individual or perceived as pleasurable. 482Under the DSM-5, OCD-related disorders include or medication-induced obsessive- compulsive and related disorder, andobsessive-compulsive and related disorder due to another medical condition. The perseverations associated with ASD may be qualitatively different and lesssophisticated than the repetitive and intrusive thoughts and actions associated with OCD. 483Repetitive behaviors in general may help anindividual with ASD regain a sense ofpredictability. Anxiety, phobias, and/ or depression may coexist with OCD in youth with ASD. Behavioral approaches are recommended as the rst line of treatment of symptoms of OCD,depending on the language and cognitive level of the patient. Cognitive behavioral therapy, including exposure and responseprevention with or without a selective serotonin reuptake inhibiter, has been demonstrated to be the mosteffective treatment for youth with OCD who do not have ASD. Cognitive behavioral therapy may be less effective, with fewer remissions, in youth who also have ASD 484(seeTable 11 for medication management). Disruptive Behavior Disorders: Aggression, Self-Injurious Behavior, andTantrums Disruptive behaviors, such as aggression, self-injury, and tantrums,may complicate home and communitymanagement of individuals with ASD.Behavioral outbursts may occur inresponse to stressful events in theenvironment, in reaction to a medical condition, as functional communication, or as a symptomsupporting diagnosis of a co-occurring mental health disorder. 485 Functional behavioral analysis andimplementation of behavioralstrategies can be an important initialstep in management. 486A proposed pathway for the primary care settingfor management of irritability thatleads to disruptive behaviors in youthwith ASD is proposed by McGuireet al. 485Disruptive behaviors may serve as communication to escapefrom a demand or an undesiredsituation. If successful, they may become part of a behavioral pattern. New onset of severe behaviorsrequires consideration of potentialmedical reasons (see Table 12).Pharmacologic treatment should beconsidered if no medical etiology isidenti ed and if the behavior is associated with irritability, is not responsive to available behavioral interventions, or is related to a co-occurring diagnosable behavioralhealth disorder, such as anxiety, mood TABLE 12 Common Presentations of Self-Injurious Behavior and the Medical Conditions to Consider If New Onset Type of Self-Injury Potential Associated Conditions Potential Associated Injury Head banging Headache, toothache, sinus infection, ear infection Detached retina, abrasions, contusions Head hitting or slapping Headache, toothache, sinus infection, ear infection Fracture of bones in hand, detached retina, abrasions, contusions Eye poking Vision loss, eye pain Eye abrasion Gum or tooth digging or bangingDental pain, gingivitis Gum injury, tooth autoextraction, tooth fracture Scratching and skin pickingAllergy, eczema, drug reaction, skin infection or infestation (eg, fleas, scabies)Infection, scarring Finger and toenail biting or pickingPain Infection, nail removal, ingrown nails, paronychia Kicking or stomping Restless leg syndrome, leg pain Bruises, fractures Rumination Gastroesophageal re flux, eosinophilic esophagitis Esophageal ulceration and bleeding, dental damage, nutritional compromise, precancerous lesions of esophagus PEDIATRICS Volume 145, number 1, January 2020 35 by guest on August 26, 2021 www.aappublications.org/news Downloaded from disorders, thought disorders, and/ or ADHD. It has been reported that between 8% and 68% of children with ASDdemonstrate aggressive behavior,depending on how stringent thedenition is. 454Aggressive behaviors were reported on the Child Behavior Checklist for one-quarter of children attending an ASD clinic, with similarrates from 2 to 16 years of age.Aggression was associated withhyperactivity, lower cognitive skills,sleep problems, and internalizingbehaviors such as anxiety. There wasno association with sex. Researchers of other studies have observed increased rates of physical aggressionin children with ASD who have loweradaptive skills and frequent repetitivebehavior. 487Management of co- occurring sleep problems andhyperactivity may be helpful ina treatment plan 488that includes behavioral intervention to addressaggression and targetedpharmacotherapy. 487 Self-injurious behaviors are reported in 40% to 50% of individuals with ASD at some point across thelifespan 489and may occur more frequently in people with ASD whoalso have aggressive behaviors andsleep problems. 490Self-injurious behaviors in individuals with ASDmay be repetitive and self- stimulatory (such as scratching, pica, or rumination). Head banging andself-hitting may occur as part ofa tantrum. Like aggression and otherdisruptive behaviors, self-injuriousbehaviors may serve ascommunication to escape fromdemands or situations that the individual does not want to be in. The type of self-injurious behavior maychange if the intervention ofprevention or blocking is notassociated with addressing theunderlying reason for the behavior.Persistence of self-injuriousbehaviors in individuals with ASD is associated with more limited cognitive and language abilities,hyperactivity, impulsivity, repetitivebehavior, and more challenges withsocial interaction. 491There is an association of self-injury with speci c genetic disorders that are not associated with ASD, such as the severe self-biting of Lesch-Nyhansyndrome. Self-injurious behavior isassociated with genetic disorders thatare also associated with ASD, such asCornelia de Lange syndrome, fragile Xsyndrome, and Smith-Magenissyndrome. 492In the case of aggressive, self-injurious, anddisruptive behaviors, the primarycare provider needs to assess thesafety of the child and family in anongoing fashion. Referral tocommunity services and forbehavioral intervention should takeplace if behaviors are unsafe or if the patient is not responding to the treatment plan. Psychopharmacologic Approaches to Management The use of medications to treat behavioral and psychiatric symptomsin children and youth with ASD has increased signi cantly since the publication of the 2007 AAP clinical reports. 493,494With a shortage of specialists, more medicationmanagement, including prescriptionof atypical antipsychotic medications,is taking place in the primary caresetting. 495,496Large national studies of insurance claim data fromMedicaid and commercial insurersreveal rates of psychopharmacologyprescription for patients with ASD tobe 56% 65%. 476,493,497One more psychotropic medications areprescribed for 1% of children withASD younger than 3 years, for 10% to 11% of children aged 3 to 5 years, for 38% to 46% of children aged 6 to11 years, and for 64% to 67% ofadolescents aged 12 to17 years. 498,499Psychotropic medication use increases withincreased age, lower range ofcognitive skills and/or presence of intellectual disability, and higher prevalence levels of challengingbehavior or coexisting psychiatricdiagnoses. 476,497 -501Prescription of medication also appears to beaffected by demographic factors, suchas race, ethnicity, and geography. 497,498,502Reported polypharmacy rates range from 12% in a registry cohort recruited fromdiagnostic clinics 499to 29% to 35% in large studies of Medicaid claimsdata. 476,493 Medication may be helpful to addressco-occurring symptoms or disorders. Clinicians should carefully weigh potential risks and bene ts before prescribing medication for behaviorand use the contraindications, dosing, potential interactions, and monitoringrequirements of the medications theyprescribe. 6Table 10 provides guidance for principles of prescribingmedication, and Table 11 listspharmaceutical options for commonbehavioral-symptom clusters. Psycho- pharmacogenomic testing for genetic variants that increase the likelihoodof adverse effects is an emerging areafor precision medicine. Prescribersshould reuptake (SSRIs), for example, despite limited data at present toguide practice. 503,504The limited data on the utility of psycho-pharmacogenomic testing at the timeof this publication limits insurancecoverage for many patients.Recommendations for testing are expected to rapidly change with ongoing research. 503 -505 Areas of Psychopharmacologic Research As the neurobiology of ASDs are better understood, novel psychopharmacologic agents might be developed that will better manage 36 FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS by guest on August 26, 2021 www.aappublications.org/news Downloaded from co-occurring symptoms and/or address core de cits. Some potentially important lines ofresearch involve medications thatmodulate metabolism of excitatory neurotransmitters (such as glutamate andg-aminobutiric acid), block acetylcholinesterase and/or nicotinicacid receptors, and act as hormonesthat naturally promote socialafliation (such as oxytocin and vasopressin). Drug trials involvenewly formulated agents as well as repurposing exiting medications used for other purposes. 506 -509 Better understanding of theneurobiology responsible for thesymptoms of ASD will allow for theidenti cation of targeted psychopharmacologic interventions.The use of psycho- pharmacogenomics to identify which patients might genetically be atgreater likelihood of bene to ra t increased risk for adverse effectsfrom speci c medications is an important area of research. 510 Integrative, Complementary, and Alternative Therapies Despite the advances in understanding the neurobiology ofASD, many unanswered questionsremain about why ASD occurs andhow best to treat it. Families oftenconsider nutritional interventions and nonmedical therapies without a scienti c evidence base to address the symptoms that conventionalinterventions cannot rapidly address,or there is limited access toconventional services in theircommunity. Primary care providersare often asked about nonstandard interventions that are used in integrative practice or are promotedon the Internet, in the popular press,by other families, and bycelebrities. 511 -516The National Center for Complementary andIntegrative Health maintains a Website in which current information on novel therapies in popular use for people with ASD is reviewed. 517Inthe past decade, an increasingnumber of interventions based ontheories of causation of ASD that are,as yet, unproven have been examinedin clinical trials. Appropriately designed trials have provided evidence to support someinterventions, such as the dietarysupplement melatonin, and havedisproven others, such as secretin. 518 Many interventions, although stillwidely used, remain unproven. Complementary therapies are often attractive to families because they arepurported to correct putativebiological causes of behavioralsymptoms and may be discussed with an optimism about outcome that is often not conveyed with therecommendation for conventionaltherapies. Between 28% and 74% ofchildren with ASD are given at least 1,and usually more than 1,complementary therapy. 519 -521 Although use of novel therapies is common among children with a range of developmental disabilities, childrenwith ASD who are irritable oroveractive or who are reported tohave food allergies may be morelikely to be given additionaltherapies. 522 Complementary, alternative, andintegrative therapies used for ASDcan be grouped into 3 general areas:(1) natural products (including herbs,vitamins and minerals, andprobiotics), (2) mind and body practices (including yoga, chiropractic, massage, acupuncture,progressive relaxation, and guidedimagery), and (3) other therapies(including traditional medicine andnaturopathy). 517 Dietary interventions used to treatsymptoms of ASD are perceived bymany families as bene cial because they are natural and without adverseeffects. Dietary elimination of gluten-and casein-containing foods is oftenimplemented in an attempt to ameliorate core symptoms of ASD, not on the basis of allergy or celiacdisease. 523,524The double-blind clinical trials to date have notdemonstrated a treatment effect with diet. 524,525Whether a subgroup of children with GI symptoms might benet from these or other dietary interventions requires additionalstudy. Children may be adequately nourished on a casein-free diet with calcium and vitamin Dsupplementation. Nutritional counseling is recommended if a trial of this diet is elected. 406It may be that improvement in unrelatedconditions may in fluence behavioral symptoms (eg, removal of dairy products may decrease irritability attributable to lactose intolerance). Dietary supplements are often given to children who are selective eatersby their families to compensate fora limited diet. 406However, many children with ASD are given vitaminsand minerals to treat proposed biochemical abnormalities that have been proposed to be unique to ASD.Popular dietary supplements include vitamin D, 526,527vitamin 6with magnesium,529 omega-3 fatty acids,530and multivitamin preparations. The literature to date is controversial with respect to vitamin supplementation as a treatment of symptoms of ASD, and at this time, no conclusive evidence exists that people with ASDrequire different nutrient intake than that recommended in the Dietary Reference Intakes (https://www.ncbi. nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK225472/). The long-term risks of high-dosesupplementation have not been studied. 531Although maternal folic acid status may provide biologicallyplausible risk for ASD, there is no evidence that supplementing with Bvitamins has therapeutic bene ta t this time, whether a child carriescommon variants in the MTHFR gene. 532,533Of dietary supplements in common use, melatonin has beendemonstrated to be a safe and effective intervention for sleep in children with ASD. 428 PEDIATRICS Volume 145, number 1, January 2020 37 by guest on August 26, 2021 www.aappublications.org/news Downloaded from Nonbiological interventions used for symptoms of ASD are popular andhave also been increasingly studied.There has been confl icting evidence regarding the effect of musictherapy, 534yoga,535,536massage,537 and equine-assisted therapy538,539on the symptoms of ASD in children, butevidence does not support thesetherapies for treatment of the coredecits of ASD at this time. Evidence to date does not support the use ofauditory integration training, inwhich an individual listens to alteredsounds through headphones in an effort to change auditory or other processing. 540Existing studies are insufcient at this time to support dance therapy, drama therapy, andchiropractic therapy. 541 Medical interventions used fornonstandard purposes also aresometimes prescribed for symptomsof ASD. Clinical trials do not supportthe use of antifungal agents,immunotherapy, or hyperbaricoxygen treatment, and concern for safety, in addition to lack of supporting data, cautions againstchelation therapy for children withASD. 516 As with any intervention, familieselecting a novel therapy should workwith their therapeutic team toidentify target symptoms they hopeto address and develop a monitoringsystem to track change. Interventionsshould be implemented in a stepwisefashion so that proper attribution of effect is possible and confounding factors can be identi ed. It is important that the medical homeprovider and family collaborate toselect and monitor safe and effectiveinterventions. 542 SECTION 6: WORKING WITH FAMILIES Families play a key role in effectivetreatment for children with ASD.Recognition that individuals who areaffected and their families are partners with the professionals in all aspects of planning a personal, local,and national agenda for ASD hasemerged and has shaped approachesto community services as well asresearch planning. 543Provision of patient- and family-centered care requires the clinician to educate the family about the child 's health and engage in respectful dialogue.Resources to support the clinician intalking to families about the diagnosisinclude a theAutism Speaks Autism TreatmentNetwork (https://www. autismspeaks.org/tool-kit/atnair-p- guide-providing-feedback-families-affected-autism). Impact of ASD on the Family The impact of having a child with ASDon other family members and onsociety is considerable. Parents of children with ASD report more stress 544,545and increased costs546 than do parents who do not havea child with ASD. More than half offamilies report that a parent needs tocut back on work or stop workingbecause of the care needs of thechild. 547The largest societal costs associated with ASD are specialeducation, residential care, and lostdays of caregiver work. 4Peer support for families of children with ASD isassociated with less parental stress,less negative mood, and more positiveperceptions. 548Parents who understand more about their child 's ASD can advocate for more intensiveand appropriate services. 549Best practice includes giving familiescontact information for a familysupport group at the time ofdiagnosis. This support may be a localgroup that provides face-to-faceinteraction and community activities or an online community. 550Many families may not have the time or inclination at the time of diagnosis tocommunicate with other familiesaffected by ASD but may nd the support useful later when they arefacing the transitions of preschool,adolescence, or adulthood. National support groups that address a wider community of children and youthwith special health care needs (suchas Family Voices and Parent2Parent),autism-speci c national support organizations (such as Autism Speaksand the Autism Society), and local organizations are effective in helping families obtain information and feelsupported. Clinicians shouldfamiliarize themselves with nationaland local sources of support andinformation so that families can begiven Web sites or phone numbers atthe time of diagnosis and again as indicated. State-speci c information on services and Maternal and Child Health Bureau -supported programs are found online (https://mchb.hrsa.gov/maternal-child-health-initiatives/autism). It is importantfor providers to advocate forinstructional material in other languages as well as be knowledgeable of other resources intheir communities that can provideservices or support to the culturallydiverse groups they serve. Comorbid conditions, such as intellectual disability and/orpsychiatric disorders, add to theimpact of ASD on family functioningand access to care. 551Although families of older children and youth typically report fewer interactions with professionals, the stress on theparent related to the ASD diagnosispersists. 552Primary care providers should speak with families about thestresses associated with ASD and thehealth of other family members andmake appropriate referrals, either for supportive counseling for the caregivers or agencies that canaddress behavioral and respite needsof the child or to address unmethealth needs in family members. The effect on siblings also needs to be considered in the context of bothanticipatory guidance and primarycare. Most siblings of children withASD do not report having a siblingwith a disability to be a negativeexperience; however, they, too, are at risk for increased stress and subsequent emotional problems. 553 38 FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS by guest on August 26, 2021 www.aappublications.org/news Downloaded from Siblings may have precocious involvement in the care of the childwith ASD, and some resent theamount of attention and resourcesthe child with ASD requires or the family 's inability to participate in activities in which they see their peers engaging. Proactively teachingsiblings about ASD and providingthem with peer support may behelpful Speaks Sibling toolkit: les/a_siblings_guide_ to_autism.pdf). Many areas to provide andsupport to siblings. It appears thatpositive parental attitudes anda supportive family setting areassociated with better siblingadjustment as well. The pediatricianshould monitor the well-being and need for behavioral health supports of siblings as well as parents. Medical Home In the AAP 's medical home model, primary care is envisioned asaccessible, continuous,comprehensive, family centered, coordinated, compassionate, and culturally sensitive for all childrenand youth, including those withspecial health care needs. Childrenwith ASD represent a population thathas had dif culty accessing comprehensive coordinated services.The chronic care model provides the structure for clinicians to collaborate with patients and their families. 554 Parents of children with ASD perceivecare to be less comprehensive, lesswell coordinated, and less familycentered than they desire and reportthat they are less satis ed with their care compared with parents of children with other special health care needs. 555Parents also perceive their providers as less well informedregarding treatments for ASD,especially complementary,alternative, and integrative therapies,than they would like them to be.Pediatricians report that they lack the knowledge to provide this support to patients with ASD 556as well as thetime and resources for specializedcare. 555,557Parents of children and youth with ASD would like betteraccess to specialty care and reportgreater unmet medical and behavioral health care needs 558and a higher nancial burden for care compared with parents of children without ASD.559 Increasing family awareness andunderstanding of the medical homecan promote partnership of theparents and primary care provider inplanning and coordinating the child 's care and advocating for their needs.National survey data reveal that family-centered and coordinated care through a medical home results infewer unmet needs, 558including dental needs.560Organizations, such as Family Voices and Family-to-Family Health Information Centers,can provide information and supportas well as resources for guiding families in developing care notebooks for their child. Through their ongoingrelationship, providers can helpchildren understand their owndiagnosis at their developmentallevel. Clinicians can remind theirpatients with ASD of their strengths,such as focus, memory, visual-spatial problem-solving, and others, as well as their personal accomplishments inbuilding skills and mastering barriersto achieve goals. Recognition ofachievement of milestones, whether itis toilet training or college graduation,should be acknowledged. Shared decision-making promotes a collaborative process for planningcare through dialogue among theindividual who is affected, caregivers,and clinicians. It can be particularly useful when the evidence for an intervention is either controversial orif there is not a uniformly acceptedapproach. 561Shared decision-making requires clarity of the question to beanswered, the options to beunderstood, and the family contextand beliefs to be respected. It is often a process rather than a single conversation. Helping children andyouth with ASD understand theirdiagnosis within the context of theirdevelopmental level can help themunderstand their symptoms andparticipate in decision-making. 562 Transition to Adulthood Planning for children with ASD to understand and participate in their own health care should begin early inadolescence, with adaptation fordevelopmental abilities. The AAPclinical report \"Supporting the Health Care Transition From Adolescence toAdulthood in the Medical Home\"provides guidance on the steps necessary to address health care transitions for all patients withchronic conditions. 563Got Transition recommends 6 core elements thatneed to be addressed for health caretransition without disruption in care,including (1) a transition policy forthe practice, (2) tracking and monitoring transition, (3) assessing transition readiness for youth and/orfamily, (4) actively planning thedetails of transition, (5) transfer ofcare, and (6) transitioncompletion. 564The pediatric health care provider is also in a position toadvise the family about teaching their adolescent with ASD about sexuality. 565Planning for wellness requires considering young adultopportunities for exercise and leisureactivities. Planning for medicaltransition for all aspects of healthcare should start around ages 12 to14 years. Educational transition starts at the school level at age 14 years and should involve the student as much aspossible. As a child approaches legal adulthood, the family may need to consider guardianship, either fullguardianship in cases in which anadult child cannot make health,nancial, or other decisions because of cognitive impairment; limitedguardianship in cases in which anindividual can participate in decision- making; or conservatorship in cases in which the oversight extends only to PEDIATRICS Volume 145, number 1, January 2020 39 by guest on August 26, 2021 www.aappublications.org/news Downloaded from nancial decision-making. Many young adults with ASD will be capable of independent decision-making and should be prepared fortransition to adulthood like other teenagers. The young adult with ASD may be eligible for SupplementalSecurity Income (SSI) bene ts. SSI is a federal program that provides fundsfor the care of individuals withdevelopmental disabilities who willnot be able to support themselvesindependently. Because of the strict guidelines regarding cognitive and adaptive delays, some adults withASD may not be eligible for SSI even iftheir disability is a barrier toemployment. Families may wish tomeet with a counselor who can advisethem on nancial planning, with attention to the needs of an adult child with developmental disability. Students with disabilities who plan to continue their education need to be advised of the transitioning process into postsecondary education.Students with disabilities areprotected under IDEA (1990;amended 1997 and 2004); Section504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973;the Americans with Disabilities Act(1990); and the ADA Amendments Act of 2008. Some colleges may provide accommodations to studentswith developmental disabilities withproper documentation of their needs,including recent academic testing.College students with ASD maybenet from continued supports around social skills development, medication monitoring, and mentoring on living independently. 566 Although resources are stillinsufcient, attention is growing for the need to provide social skillstraining for youth with ASD with andwithout intellectual disabilities toenter the workforce in competitiveemployment as well as job skilldevelopment. There are insuf cient group-home and supportedcommunity -living arrangements for adults with ASD to meet the demandsin most communities. The clinicianshould initiate discussions withparents regarding their plans forwhere their child with ASD willprogress to postsecondary school education and/or employment and their plans for where their child willlive in adulthood early in adolescenceso the family can plan appropriately with community agencies. Families should work with their child 's school throughout adolescence to target the skills their child will need to master to be successful in young adult programs, the workforce,or postsecondary education. Goals forincreasing skills may include academic, social, communication, leisure, and self-care goals. Familiesneed information to be as proactiveas possible in planning for health, academic, job, and residential needs in young adulthood. Additionalresearch is needed to develop andevaluate evidence-based and effective interventions for this age group. 314 The pediatric health care provider should provide anticipatory guidance to the family in the context of ongoing health supervision and communicatewith identi ed adult providers for smooth health care transition. 567 State Programs, Supports, and Laws State laws related to education, social service, and insurance for individuals with ASD vary signi cantly. Although the federal government mandates early intervention for children at risk for developmental delay and a free and appropriate education forstudents aged 3 to 21 years who havespeci c educationally handicapping conditions, the implementation ofeducational services varies by stateand locality. The law states thatservices need to be appropriate, not necessarily optimal. No legal mandate for adult services exists, although theagencies that provide residentialservices, service coordination, job training, and adult day services typically are funded through thestates.The social services and home- andcommunity-based waiver servicesavailable to families whose childrenhave developmental disabilities,including ASD, differ from state tostate. 568The clinician should be familiar with the requirements for programs in their state that might lead to a Medicaid waiver (medicalassistance as a secondary insurancefor children with special health careneeds), service coordination, respitecare, and other nancial or behavioral supports afforded a family whena child has special health care needs. The clinician may need to complete a form to verify the diagnosis andneeds for eligibility. Of note, somechildren with ASD who have typicalcognitive abilities may not qualify formany special education and socialservice supports. However, later on, atthe time of transition to adulthood, if they experience dif culty with employment and daily-living skills, they may qualify for support services. SECTION 7: RESEARCH AND SERVICE NEEDS More than $1.5 billion of private and public research funding was devotedto ASD between 2008 and 2010. 569 The passage of the Combating AutismAct of 2006 (Public Law 109 -416) and its reauthorization in 2014 as theAutism Collaboration, Accountability, Research, Education and Support Act (CARES) Act (Public Law 113 -157) continued a trend in funding toaddress the intervention needs ofindividuals diagnosed with ASD.Before this time, research fundingwas largely focused on the geneticsand neurobiology of the disorder. However, this changed with the convening of the National Institutesof Health Interagency AutismCoordinating Committee in 2006. Thecommittee was assembled to provideguidance to the agencies fundingautism services, and the researchagenda was expanded on the basis of the contributions of stakeholders, including families, individuals 40 FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS by guest on August 26, 2021 www.aappublications.org/news Downloaded from affected, and federal agencies. The committee 's 2009 strategic plan, updated in 2017,570identi ed 7 areas for research funding: (1) early detection, (2) underlying biology, (3)genetic and environmental riskfactors, (4) treatments and interventions, (5) services and implementation science, (6) lifespanservices and supports, and (7)epidemiological surveillance and infrastructure. 571The committee recommended that multiple levels of inquiry be pursued simultaneously to inform evidence-based clinical care. These levels include the following: basic and translational science in the areas of genetics and epigenetics, neurobiology, andpsychopharmacology to understand typical and atypical brain development and function todevelop ASD-speci c behavioral and pharmacologic therapies; additional research is needed to identify and understand ASD riskfactors that might be mitigated toreduce ASD-related disability; research into the underlying neurobiology of sensory symptomsand restricted interests andrepetitive behaviors to informdevelopment of targetedinterventions; clinical trials to test focusedinterventions based on theunderlying biological processesinvolved with ASD to determine ifthey are appropriate forcommunity application; epidemiological surveillance togather data important for planningfor current and future needs,including screening, diagnosis, andlifespan health and mental health services; and health services research to provide guidance for comprehensive,accessible, and culturallyappropriate medical, educational,and behavioral care for children, youth, adults, and families affected by ASD.Research in all of these areas iscritical to move forward with earlydiagnosis, effective treatment, andevidence-based interventions ateach age. PEDIATRIC RECOMMENDATIONS To provide appropriate care to allchildren and families affected by ASD,health, education, and public healthsystems need to collaborate and buildintegrated and adequately funded andstaffed systems. Early identi cation and treatment: Pediatric providersshould use screening and surveillance to provide accurate and early identi cation, cost- effective and timely diagnosis,prompt implementation ofevidence-based interventions, andelimination of disparities toaccess to care for children withASD. Clinicians should respond appropriately to family or clinical concerns and results of screeningto avoid delays in diagnosis andtreatment. Collaboration of systems of care: Children with ASD should be provided evidence-based servicesto address social, academic, andbehavioral needs at home andschool; access to appropriatepediatric and mental health care;respite services; and leisureactivities. Planning for adolescence andtransition to adult systems of care:Communities should build servicesto promote social skills appropriatefor work and postsecondaryeducation, access to appropriate medical and behavioral health services, job skills development,and community leisureopportunities. Pediatricians need toengage with families and youth toplan a transition to adult medicaland behavioral health care. Themedical home provider should support the family and youth in advocating for appropriatepostsecondary work or schooling,residential supports, and activitiesto maintain a healthy lifestyle. Informed individuals and families:The pediatrician can educate youthwith ASD and their families aboutthe evidence for interventions,refer families for possibleparticipation in clinical researchwhen appropriate, refer families to support organizations, and prepare families to navigatetransitions. Informed pediatric providers: Tobest serve patients and familiesaffected by ASD, the clinician caring for children and youth with ASD should be familiar with issuesrelated to diagnosis, coexistingmedical and behavioral conditions,and the impact of ASD on the familyto provide a medical home for thesepatients. Actively addressingcapacity building to care for children and youth with ASD requires initiatives directed atprovider education and practicequality improvement and publichealth, educational, and socialprograms to support families intheir journey from diagnosis toservice provision to transition to adult care.

FUNDING: No external funding. POTENTIAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST: MeMix LLC is a company that makes an application (for phones). Dr Levy is on the advisory board for the application 's development. This application is being developed to assist in nutritional and dietary management of children with autism. Dr Levy has not received any money yet from this company. This application is the focus of a National Institutes of Health R21 grant, for which Dr Levy is funded for 2% of her salary. Once it is studied and marketed (if appropriate), Dr Levy will (possibly in the future) earn some money. Her years of relationship with the company are 2015 to the present. Dr Hyman has a relationship with Roche. Dr Hyman is the site principal investigator of a clinical trial of a novel agent being tested to promote social function in patients with autism. The University of Rochester (Dr Hyman 's institution) was 1 of .40 sites and had 2 study participants in 2018. University of Rochester will be leaving the trial in 2019 (withdrawal submitted) because of staf ng, and that reimbursement for staff time does not cover the cost of participation. Funding was for the staff to complete the assessments required for the clinical trial. Dr Hyman got no personal reimbursement from the company; the funding was for staff time forrecruitment and assessment and clinical research center support for the trial.
