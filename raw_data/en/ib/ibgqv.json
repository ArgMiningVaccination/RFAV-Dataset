Integrative medicine is care for the whole person: mind, body, and spirit. Providers Integrative Family Medicine at Madsen We provide care for people of all ages, including infants and children. Our clinicians look at the whole person and all available strategies to improve health for both preventive and disease-focused care. We work closely with providers across the health system and in the community. If you are establishing care and would like to discuss your health in depth, please fill out our age-appropriate health survey prior to your visit. Integrative Consultation Integrative consultation is available for patients who are interested in looking at a particular health concern more closely and already have an established relationship with another primary care provider. Consultations take place during an initial 60-minute appointment with follow-up visits as needed. Both patients and health care providers can request appointments for integrative consultations. "}
