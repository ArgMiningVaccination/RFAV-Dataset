According to Acupuncture, the body's natural resistance against diseases and its repair capability are defined as a movement of energy that flows all over the body, which is called the healthy energy. When body is functioning properly, it identifies and attacks a variety of threats, including viruses, bacteria and parasites. This mechanism of defending ourselves from foreign organism is called Immunity. Immune system is made up of special organs, cells, chemicals etc to fight back. The [immune system](https://healthvision.in/boost-immunity-the-key-to-save-yourself-from-corona/) keeps a record of every microbe it has ever defeated, in types of white blood cells known as memory cells. This means it can recognize and destroy the microbe quickly if it enters the body again. Parts of the immune system are listed below and explained: White Blood Cells (WBC): WBC plays a key role in immune system. It is produced in bone marrow and move through blood all over the body in search of foreign invaders. If any foreign organism is found in the body, then it starts attacking and defeats it. Antibodies: These are the protective proteins produced by our body. These proteins recognize the toxins emitted by microbes and starts removing them from our body. Lymphatic System: The Lymphatic System is a network of delicate tubes throughout the body. The main functions of the lymphatic system are to: 1. Manage the fluid levels in the body. 2. React to Bacteria 3. Deal with Cancer Cells 4. Deal with cell products that otherwise would result in disease or disorders 5. Absorb some of the fats in our diet from the intestine. Spleen: The spleen is a blood-filtering organ that removes microbes and destroys old or damaged red blood cells. It also makes disease-fighting components of the immune system (including antibodies and lymphocytes). Bone Marrow: Bone marrow is the spongy tissue found inside our bones. It produces the red blood cells which carries oxygen, the white blood cells we use to fight infection, and the platelets we need to help our blood clot. Thymus: The thymus gland produces progenitor cells, which mature into T-cells. The body uses T-cells to destroy infected or cancerous cells. T-cells made by the thymus also support other organs in the immune system to grow correctly. The body's other defenses against microbes: Along with immune system, the body has several other ways to defend itself against microbes. 1.Skin - a waterproof barrier that secretes oil with bacteria-killing properties. 2.Lungs - mucous in the lungs (phlegm) traps foreign particles, and small hair (cilia) wave the mucous upwards so it can be coughed out 3.Digestive Tract - the mucous lining contains antibodies, and the acid in the stomach can kill most microbes 4.Saliva and Tears contain anti-bacterial enzymes that help reduce the risk of infection. Acupuncture perspective of Immune System: From the beginning Acupuncture is based / practiced on holistic approach. It considers human body as an organic whole. It also says that human being is a part of nature and includes all environmental characteristics within him. Internal and external environment is functioning with mutual balancing, integral stability and harmony. Any disturbances in this equilibrium will cause disease. Each part of the body such as Qi (vital energy), blood, body fluids, organs and meridians has their own functions. They combine to build up the body's defense system and bring out their protective strength mutually. According to Acupuncture, the body's natural resistance against diseases and its repair capability are defined as a movement of energy that flows all over the body, which is called the healthy energy. Healthy energy is the integral manifestation of the human body's immune functions. Under regular circumstances, the body is influenced by immune system to battle against several infections and to clear up injurious materials in order to retain a clean interior environment. When the immune system functions typically, health can be retained; or else disharmony will follow which leads to illness. Immune modulation effects are an important part of immune functioning. Acupuncture follow that when healthy energy is abundant, evil forces cannot prevail. According to the yin yang theory, the body's yin and yang are regulated and adjusted continuously. Keeping yin and yang in stability is a crucial aspect to carry on typical life activities. Once this equilibrium is disturbed, disease will emerge. It becomes utmost important to maintain healthy energy circulation to increase our protective Qi (vital energy). If there is any deficiency in our protective Qi or healthy energy circulation, then we are prone to get invaded. The approaches are generally focused on holistic instruction and possession of twofold modulation effects, which as stated above, are to take out excesses and replace deficits. It becomes important to share that Vital energy can be categorized as: 1.Defensive energy which works as protective blanket 2.Nutritional energy we get from good food we eat. 3.Congenital energy what we get from our Kidneys during our birth It is said that we have 3 different Defensive Qi (vital energy) to protect us: 1.Defense Qi: It recognizes, mobilizes, attacks and eliminates such as pathogens, microbes, vaccines and toxins. A deficiency in this Qi allows infections to take hold in the body. 2.Surveillance Qi: This Qi, keeps tab on all parts of the body in search of any foreign organisms. It attacks and eliminates cancer cells. 3.Tolerance Qi: This Qi can recognize and differentiate self from non-self; foreign substances are attacked while the self is preserved. In auto-immune disease, this tolerance is disturbed and Qi will act against itself. We would like to share few Acupressure points which helps in boosting our immune system. Give medium pressure to the shown points for about 3-5 minutes (daily twice) DR. GOWRI B. N. & DR. VENKATESH PRASAD K. N. No.2, 1st Cross, 7th Main Mathikere, Near Canara Bank, Bangalore - 560 054.
