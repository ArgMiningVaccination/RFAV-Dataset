If you plan to reap the benefits of bathing in cold water or ice baths, you must first understand how to prepare one correctly. - Timing and temperature control are critical. There are unique cold bathtubs that help regulate temperature so people don't experience hypothermia. - If this is your first time trying out an ice bath, going beyond 10-15 degrees Celsius is not advisable. Time your bath to ensure it does not exceed 2-3 minutes. - Try out the water by dipping your feet first so your body gets used to the temperature before fully immersing yourself in it. - Keep warm towels and blankets ready for when you exit the tub. Breathing evenly is essential; one shouldn't panic while in a bath. - If you are trying a DIY ice bath at home, fill it with cold water, add ice cubes, and stir them to distribute the temperature evenly. Insert a thermometer into the ice bath and ensure its tip is submerged in the water, not just touching the sides or bottom of the container. Wait for the thermometer to stabilize to get an accurate reading. Potential benefits of ice baths Ice baths are typically taken during warmer months. It is a boon for you, especially if you struggle with chronic muscle pains after exercise and workouts. They not only soothe muscle pain but quicken your recovery as well. Ice baths also support your immunity and reduce inflammation. In addition, cool water can calm your nervous system and help manage stress. Ice baths also increase your energy exponentially and help release dopamine and serotonin levels which can improve your mood and sleep cycle.

Ice baths can relieve those who suffer from a chronic bone or muscle-related illness. Supports immunity Cold water can preserve cells from decaying, which is why ice baths are suitable for the immune system, too, as it helps us fight illnesses and improve our nervous and lymphatic system functions.

It calms the muscle spasms and the burning sensation. Cold water plunges are a form of cryotherapy wherein cold water or ice packs are used to treat swellings or similar issues. This is why people sometimes advise using a cold compress for swelling and inflammation caused due to an injury. Frequency for having ice baths Even though cold bath benefits have made a difference in many people's lives, one shouldn't take more than 2 or 3 baths per week because there are some risks involved in going overboard with this practise.

Ice baths may not directly cause a cold but can temporarily weaken the immune system, making you susceptible to catching a cold. Individuals not used to the cold sensation may fall sick and are also vulnerable to frostbite. - Ice baths are not suitable for children under the age of 12 as their bodies may not be able to tolerate the cold temperature as well as adults. They should only go for an ice bath if a professional has prescribed it. In the case of hypothermia, follow these emergency procedures that may help reduce its severity. - Remove the individual from the cold water immediately and layer them with warm blankets and a warm compress. - Do not use hot water directly as that may damage the skin and not regulate the body temperature correctly. - Monitor their breathing and try to insulate their legs with the help of warm socks. - Consuming hot or warm beverages helps regulate the body's inner temperature and instantly relieves the pain. Although cold baths are therapeutic, exercise precaution while plunging into one and consult a specialist before opting for an icy cool bath. Stay tuned to the Activ Living Community.
