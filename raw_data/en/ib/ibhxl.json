Thus, it is important to be aware of the symptoms of Lexapro withdrawal. It functions as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). In addition to treating depression, Lexapro is also prescribed for anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and panic disorder. Lexapro is usually taken for a period of many years, either until a person feels that they don't need it anymore or until they begin experiencing negative side effects and decide to switch medications. However, ceasing to take Lexapro should not be undertaken lightly\u2014or without clinical oversight. Lexapro withdrawal symptoms can be severe, particularly if you attempt to stop abruptly. Instead, the dosage should be slowly tapered down over a period of time and under the guidance of medical professionals who can help prevent or mitigate any withdrawal symptoms. Clinical oversight is especially valuable in the rare case of a complication as expertise is vital for both identifying and effectively addressing potential problems before they become critical. You should speak with your doctor about any concerns you have in stopping Lexapro. What Are the Emotional Symptoms of Lexapro Withdrawal? Changing or ceasing a medication can be an emotional experience in and of itself, but it becomes especially so when the medication in question directly affects your mood. As Lexapro is an antidepressant, it may come as no surprise that the symptoms of Lexapro withdrawal include emotional experiences such as: - Anxiety. This is a result of the low levels of serotonin levels in the brain. - Concentration problems. This is due in part to the negative effects of the other withdrawal symptoms but is also related to imbalanced neurotransmitter levels in the brain. - Depersonalization. This is a sort of inexplicable sensation where a person simply does not feel quite like his or her natural self. He or she may feel emotionless or listless. - Depression. Since the drug is often used to treat depression, once a person stops taking it, it is possible that the depression may return or worsen in the absence of other treatments that can provide adequate emotional support in place of Lexapro. - Irritability or mood swings. Some people may experience bouts of unexplained anger as well as irritability and mood swings, either when taking or when quitting Lexapro. - Suicidal thoughts. These thoughts can increase or intensify during withdrawal. It is important to seek medical support as soon as possible if this occurs. Many of these effects can be difficult enough to deal with on their own. However, the effects of Lexapro withdrawal are not limited to merely the psychological\u2014there may be physical effects as well. What Are the Physical Symptoms of Lexapro Withdrawal? There are a wide variety of potential physical symptoms you or your loved one may experience during Lexapro withdrawal, some of which can be quite serious. Possible effects include: - Appetite changes (generally, this will be opposite the appetite you experienced while on Lexapro). - \"Brain zaps\" (the sensation that small electrical shocks are running through one's brain). - Dizziness, fatigue, or confusion. - Headaches. - Insomnia. - Fever. - Nausea or indigestion. - Sweating. - Weight changes (often, weight loss). - Dry mouth. - Frequent urination. - Altered perception of certain senses, such as smell or taste. Several factors can influence how severe withdrawal symptoms are. These factors include how long you or your loved one has been taking Lexapro, how high the dosage is, and other factors related to your unique individual physiology. In short, the longer you take the drug, the harder it will be to come off of it. Similarly, the higher the dosage, the harder the withdrawal process will be. There is no set timeline for how long you can expect withdrawal symptoms to last. Many people will see an improvement in symptoms after about three months\u2014which can seem like an eternity if you are struggling with these symptoms on your own. It's always good to have a medical professional behind you to help gently taper off Lexapro. How to Quit Taking Lexapro Safely Lexapro can be an effective solution for many people, but if it is time for you to change medications or quit taking antidepressants entirely, do not be discouraged by the long list of potential withdrawal symptoms.
