School staff are not medically trained, therefore it is outside their remit to advise other staff and families around any medical issues including the decision to vaccinate. Recognising that some parents and school staff consult anthroposophical doctors we wanted to draw your attention to the statement of the International Federation of Anthroposophic Medical Associations (IVAA) and the Medical Section of the Goetheanum which welcomes the development of the vaccines and their roll out worldwide. [https://www.ivaa.info/latest-news/article/article/anthroposophic-medicine-statement-on-vaccination-against-sars-cov-2/](https://www.ivaa.info/latest-news/article/article/anthroposophic-medicine-statement-on-vaccination-against-sars-cov-2/) The Steiner Waldorf education movement is sometimes linked to suggestions that our schools take an anti-vaccination stance. This is incorrect. Vaccination is a medical, not an education issue and no school is \"anti-vaccination\". Schools play their part in supporting good public health generally through the promotion of healthy eating, active life-styles and strong emotional health. Some schools have facilitated the giving of the flu vaccine when requested. As a school movement we continue to fully support the national effort to tackle the spread of Covid 19, following all Government guidance provided to schools.
