FY 2015 VHA COMPLEMENTARY AND INTEGRATIVE HEALTH (CIH) SERVICES (FORMERLY CAM) Prologue The Fiscal Year (FY) 2015 Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Complementary and Integrative Health Services (CIH) (formerly Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM)) survey is an essential element in assessing and improving the delivery of CIH throughout VHA. In order to assess how CIH are developing within VHA, data collected have been compared to the results of the previous VHA CAM surveys of 2011 and 2002 where appropriate. In this report the term CIH is used in preference to CAM as this more accurately reflects how these modalities are used within Veterans Affairs (VA ). They are used to complement or are integrated with allopathic/conventional care and not as an al ternative. VHA's mission is to \"honor America's Veterans by providing exceptional health care that improves their health and well -being .\" The first strategic goal of VHA is \"to provide Veterans personalized, proactive, patient -driven health care.\" 1 This approach embodies Whole Health, which is informed by evidence, and makes use of all appropriate therapeutic approaches, health care professionals, and disciplines. It prioritizes the Veterans and their values, and partners with them to create a personalized strategy to optimize health, healing, and well - being. The Blueprint for Excellence offers a detailed vision for the evolution of health services to engage and inspire Veterans to \"their highest possible level of health and well -being. \"2 Integrative health refers to the integration of allopathic or conventional care with what were previously referred to as CAM modalities. The focus of Integrative Health encompasses the entire spectrum of health care from the treatment and mitigation of chronic diseases and conditions to optimizing health and well -being to prevention. C IH represent s an approach VA can use to provide Veterans with a whole health approach to care that is personalized, proactive, and patient -driven. CIH services are complex and dynamic, and some of the services that were once considered complementary are now part of mainstream health care. As an example, chiropractic care is now considered a part of conventional care within VA. The National Institutes of Health's National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) , formerly National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) , states that , \"There are many definitions of \"integrative\" health care, but all involve bringing conventional and complementary approaches together in a coordinated way. \"We use 'integrative healt h' when we talk about incorporating complementary approaches into mainstream health care.\" 3 The growth in utilization of CIH has generated increased interest and inquiries from Congress and the Secretary of VA. The purpose of the CIH survey is to evaluate and report on the current state of Integrative Health services across the VA Health Care System. The background, methodology, key findings , and recommendations , are prov ided in this report. Of note, in 2002, chiropractic care was considered a CAM modality, but was removed from the 2011 survey as it became a part of standard VA care. In order to provide a more accurate picture of the availability of CIH services within VA, chiropractic care has been included in the 2015 survey. The information from this report will be used to identify strategic initiatives and programmatic directions that may be addressed by the Office of Patient Centered Care and Cultural Transformation (OPCC&CT) and the recently established Integrative Health Coordinating Center.

G-1 Healthcare Analysis & Information Group (HAIG) A Field Unit of the Office of Strategic Planning & Analysis within the Office of the ADUSH for Policy and Planning FY 2015 VHA Complementary & Integrative Health (CIH) Services (formerly CAM) 3Background There is growing use of complementary and integrative health (CIH) approaches, historically referred to as complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), across the United States (US). National surveys since the early 1990's have shown individuals, including Veterans, are using CIH in addition to conventional medicine. The National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) has included questions on CIH since 2002. Between 2002 and 2012, the use of CIH services has remained constant between 32 and 35 percent of U . S. civilian adults, with the same five modalities remaining the most frequently used: Non- vitamin/non- mineral supplements, deep breathing, yoga/tai chi/qi -gong, chiropractic/osteopathic manipulation, and meditation. 4 In 2005, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) issued a consensus report on CAM in the US. The IOM recommended that 1) the same principles and standards of evidence of treatment effectiveness apply to all treatments, whether currently labeled as conventional medicine or CAM and 2) that health profession schools (e.g., schools of medicine, nursing, pharmacy, and allied health) should incorporat e sufficient information about CAM into the standard curriculum at the undergraduate, graduate, and postgraduate levels to enable licensed professionals to competently advise their patients about CAM services. 5 The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM), was established as a division of the National Institutes for Health by Congress under Title VI, Section 601 of the Omnibus Appropriations Act of 1999 (P.L. 105- 277). The mission of NCCAM has been to define, through rigorous scientific investigation, the usefulness and safety of CIH interventions and their roles in improving health and health care. This body of knowledge continues to grow and is contributing to the evidence and understanding of the utility of CIH in health care. NCCAM's name was changed to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, or NCCIH, in 2014 to reflect the fact that complementary approaches have grown in use, are not viewed as an alternative to allopathic care , and are generally used in combination with conventional medical care. Research on complementary and integrative approaches, including both VA projects and those co-f unded with NCCIH and the Department of Defense (DoD), is a component of the transformational ac tions called for i n Strategy Seven of the VA's Blueprint for Excellence. 2,6 VA recognizes that complementary and integrativ e approaches may empower Veterans to improve their own well-b eing, and this is one of the driving strategies behind VA research on these approaches. The launch of the VA Opioid Safety Initiative in October 2013 highlighted concerns within VA of the use of opioids to treat pain. The goal of this initiativ e was to offer a comprehensive, multi-pronged approach to the management of pain, and to reduce the use of opiates in pain management. Similarly, in February 2015, a working group of the NCCIH recommended that NCCIH undertake a large scale research study to look at non-p harmacological approaches to pain management. These endeavors underscore the need for VA to better understand the role of CIH within VA health care, and the part it should play in helping VA deliver personalized, proactive, and patient-d riven care to Veterans. Healthcare Analysis & Information Group (HAIG) A Field Unit of the Office of Strategic Planning & Analysis within the Office of the ADUSH for Policy and Planning FY 2015 VHA Complementary & Integrative Health (CIH) Services (formerly CAM) 4Methodology In the United States, there is no standard method for recording the delivery of CIH services. Given that there is no consistent way to capture these data within electronic health records (CPRS/ VistA) and administrative data in VA, a survey methodology was used. Data wer e collect ed using a web- based survey t ool ad ministered by t he Healthcare Analysis a nd Information Group (HAIG). The survey was d istributed b y VISN of fices t o facility Chiefs of S taff who collaborated with their CIH Point(s) of Contact (if applicable) and/or appropriate Patient Centered Care Point(s) of Contact to complete this survey. The sur vey was in the field from December 9, 2014 through January 22, 2015. It was sent to the 14 1 VHA Administrative Parents consisting of Medical Centers and Health Care Systems. The response rate was 100 percent. Survey data were self -reported. Responses were not independently verified and may be subject to individual interpretation. HAIG validated answers with survey respondents where errors in data were apparent. Healthcare Analysis & Information Group (HAIG) A Field Unit of the Office of Strategic Planning & Analysis within the Office of the ADUSH for Policy and Planning FY 2015 VHA Complementary & Integrative Health (CIH) Services (formerly CAM) 5Key Findings Most administrative parent facilities offer at least one CIH service to Veterans (93% in 2015 vs. 89% in 2011) . (Table 1.) Although many facilities offer CIH services, the availability of these services is limited. In facilities offering an individual CIH service, only acupuncture, chiropractic, mindfulness, Stress Management Relaxation Therapy (SMRT ), acupressure, and movement practices are offered at a rate equivalent to at least one half day per week. (Table 4.3.) CIH services are offered in all the VA clinical care settings inquired about in this survey. (Table 2.) The reported inpatient clinical settings offering the most CIH services, regardless of prov ider type, were Extended Care (72 sites) and Mental Health (69 sites). The most reported outpatient settings were Mental Health (116 sites) with Rehabilitation (104 sites) being the second highest reported of the 131 sites providing CIH services in VHA. Most CIH services are offered by VA providers, however, a portion of this care is provided by Without Compensation ( WOC ) providers. The most common CIH services being provided by WOC providers include Yoga ( 58%), Animal Assisted therapy (52%), and Tai -chi/Qi gong (36%). (Table 3.) The 10 most common CIH services provided at VA facilities are: (Table 4.) 1.SMRT herapy 9.Biofeedback 10.Animal Therapy Chiropractic care and acupuncture are the two modalities most likely to be referred to non- VA care providers by a VA facility . (Table 4.) Of the 131 sites offering CIH services, the top perceived factors enabling services are that CIH isconsistent wit h patient -centered model of care (122 sites), promotes well -being (121 sites), being adjunctive to chronic disease management (109 sites), as well as patient preference (104 sites).(Table 1.b.) Provider s' perception of the top three services for which veterans are asking for more offerings include acupuncture (80%), chiropractic (80%), and massage therapy (81%). (Table 4.5.) Healthcare Analysis & Information Group (HAIG) A Field Unit of the Office of Strategic Planning & Analysis within the Office of the ADUSH for Policy and Planning FY 2015 VHA Complementary & Integrative Health (CIH) Services (formerly CAM) 6For these common conditions of Veterans in 2015, the following were the most frequently offered CIH modalities. The number provided is the total number of facilities that offer these top modalities. (Tables A1, A2, and A4.) Anxiety Disorders Depression PTSD Stress Management Musculoskeletal Pain Mindfulness 99 (65%) Mindfulness 94 88 (58%) 99 (65%) Chiropractic 101 (86%) Guided Imagery 87 (90%) Guided Imagery 83 (86%) Guided Imagery 79 (81%) Guided Imagery 88 (91%) PMRT (67%) Yoga 57 (56%) 64 (63%) PMRT 62 (73 %) Yoga 62 (61%) Yoga 74 (73%) SMRT 57 (50%) Note: In these five conditions, Stress Management Relaxation Therapy (SMRT) and Progressive Muscle Relaxation Therapy (PMRT) were used to treat all these conditions . As compared to 2002 and 2011, there is an increased number of VHA facilities offering a greater variety of complementary and integrative health services. Although the total number of sites offeringCIH has increased each consecutive survey year , the number of Veterans receiving these services is marginal . (Table 4. and 4.3.) Of note, the use of CIH services in the perioperative period i s limited compared to use of CIH modalities for chronic pain conditions . (Tables A. 4. - A.6.) Healthcare Analysis & Information Group (HAIG) A Field Unit of the Office of Strategic Planning & Analysis within the Office of the ADUSH for Policy and Planning FY 2015 VHA Complementary & Integrative Health (CIH) Services (formerly CAM) 7Recommendations There needs t o be a more systematic method to c apture provision of C IH within VHA. These d ata should include what is offered, how frequently it is offered, and who is offering it. This would require strengthening the adminis trative data capture infrastructure such as clinic stop codes and Current Proc edural T erminology ( CPT) codes , as well as inclusion of C IH m odalities within the c linical inventory. Capturing of s uch dat a would allow V HA to assess t he effect of C IH on pat ient he alth. Until s uch time as other monitoring means are available to assess CIH use within VHA , the VHA CIH survey should be repeated at regular intervals. This will allow VHA to track changes in CIH service delivery, and have a more informed process of strategic planning and implementation of CIH in VHA. While the modalities of CIH provided in VHA are known, we do not have information on the interests and utilization of CIH by Veterans who use VHA services. A survey of Veterans on their interest and use of CIH would assist VHA in developing an appropriate level and array of CIH services . With th ese data, strategies should be developed to assess the value and the sustainability of CIH services. Mental health conditions are heavily represented as areas of CIH utilization and may be an area where further study should be undertaken to determine value and effectiveness . Additional study of CIH practices should be undertaken for conditions where they may enhance the overall care provided to the Veterans when administered in conjunction with conventional medicine. This would include such areas as promotion of health, management of pain, and the management of mental health conditions. In locations where CIH s ervices ha ve been shown to b e beneficial t o Veterans and/or l ocations t hat desire to enhance their service offerings to patients, consideration should be given to alleviate common barriers s uch as funding, clinic space, and hiring of practitioners. As the evidence to support the use of CIH pr ac tices gr ows and t hes e practices becom e more incorpor ated into VA care, the term C IH should be eliminat ed as these prac tices s hould si mply be considered p art of V A care.
