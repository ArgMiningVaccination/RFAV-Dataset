Care Advice for Acne - What You Should Know About Acne: - More than 90% of teenagers have some acne. Acne is a normal part of the teen years. - There is no medicine at this time that will cure acne. - However, good skin care can keep acne under control and at a mild level. - Here is some care advice that should help. - Benzoyl Peroxide Gel: - Benzoyl Peroxide (BP) is the best OTC medicine for bringing acne under control. Use a Benzoyl Peroxide 5% gel product (such as the store brand). OTC means no prescription is needed. - It helps to open pimples and to unplug blackheads. It also kills bacteria. - Apply the lotion once a day at bedtime to the area with acne. Redheads and blonds should apply it every other day for the first 2 weeks. Reason: More sensitive skin. - Use an amount of lotion the size of a pea. This should be enough to cover most of the acne. - If the skin becomes red or peels, use less of it. Other option: You can use it less often. - Caution: Avoid the corners of the eyes, nose and mouth. Reason: These areas are very sensitive. - Caution: Benzoyl Peroxide bleaches clothing, towels, blankets, etc. Apply it only at bedtime and put it on sparingly. Use a plain white pillowcase. - Antibiotics for Red Bumps: - Large red bumps mean the infection has spread beyond the oil gland. If you have several red bumps, your doctor may prescribe an antibiotic. - Antibiotics come as solutions for the skin or as pills. - The antibiotic will kill the bacteria that are causing the infection. - Give the antibiotic as directed. - Washing the Face: - Wash your skin twice a day. The most important time to wash is bedtime. Just use warm water or you can use a mild soap (such as Dove). - Shampoo your hair daily. - Avoid scrubbing your skin. Reason: Hard scrubbing of the skin irritates the openings of the oil glands. This causes them to close off even more tightly. - Pimple Opening: - Opening (popping) pimples is not advised by many doctors. But, most teens and adults do it anyway. - So, here's how to open a pimple safely without any squeezing. - Never open a pimple before it has come to a head. - Wash your face and hands first. - Use a sterile needle (cleaned with rubbing alcohol). Nick the surface of the yellow pimple with the tip of the needle. The pus should run out without squeezing. - Wipe away the pus and wash the area with soap and water. - Opening small pimples in this way will not cause skin damage. - Avoid Picking or Squeezing Acne: - Many young people pick at their acne when they are not thinking about it. Picking makes acne worse. - Try not to touch the face at all during the day. - Squeezing blackheads causes bleeding into the skin. The bleeding turns into brownish blotches on the skin. They can take 1 or 2 months to fade. - Squeezing red lumps can force bacteria into the skin. This too leaves blotches. It can also cause a serious face infection. - Prevention - Avoid Triggers of Acne: - Avoid putting any oily or greasy substances on your face. Reason: They block oil glands and make acne worse. If you use cosmetics, use water-based cosmetics. - Avoid hair tonics or hair creams (especially greasy ones). When you sweat, they will get on the face and irritate the acne. - What to Expect: - With treatment, new whiteheads and blackheads will decrease. But, it takes 6 to 8 weeks. - Acne usually lasts until age 20 or 25. - So, you will need to continue the treatment for several years. - You don't need to worry about scarring. It is very rare for acne to leave any scars. - Call Your Doctor If: - With treatment, the acne has not improved after 2 months - It looks infected (large, red, tender bumps) - You think your child needs to be seen - Your child becomes worse And remember, contact your doctor if your child develops any of the 'Call Your Doctor' symptoms.
