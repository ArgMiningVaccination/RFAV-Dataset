No, stem cell extraction does not kill unborn babies! Medicine has come a long way since the 1990s. So Holistic Bio Spa provides pluripotent stem cells that are extracted from discarded tissue from the umbilical cord and placenta. These stem cells are 100% ethical and never harm babies nor pregnant mothers. Out of respect and appreciation for the sacredness of life, we would never have adopted this method of health care if it harmed human lives, born yet or not. Our alternative medical center in Puerto Vallarta is one of only a few dozens in the whole country that works with internationally recognized and certified stem cell cryobanks.
