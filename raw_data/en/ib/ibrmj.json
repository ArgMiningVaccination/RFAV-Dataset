This will be a four\u00ad year, in-residence program, effective Fall 2018. . . A. Centrality to Institutional Mission Statement and Planning Priorities 1. Program description and alignment with mission The mission of Maryland University of Integrative Health (MUIH) is: A distinctive community ofscholars/ researchers/ practitioners/ advocates/ Maryland University ofIntegrative Health promotes whole person relationship-centered healthcare. Through discovery and exploration we deliver progressive educational programs/ advance innovative clinical model~ build mutually benefidal partnerships/ and provide opportunities for fulfilling careers. Our vision: Serving as a leader in the global transformation ofhealth and we/Ines~ we integrate healing traditions and contemporary science/ acknowledge the wisdom ofthe body and nature as a teacher, and focus on the interconnection ofmin~ body, and spirit Our work enables people to thrive through the cycles oflife. MUIH is the pre-eminent institution in the U.S. for the study of health and wellness. Its programs integrate healing traditions and contemporary science and acknowledge the wisdom of the body and nature as a teacher to educate diverse and erudite health-care professionals for today and tomorrow. In keeping with its mission and vision, MUIH currently offers graduate programs in areas related to natural medicine such as acupuncture, herbal medicine, health and wellness coaching, nutrition, and yoga therapy. MUIH has been a pioneer and driving force in the national movement toward wellness, disease prevention, and relationship-centered healthcare. As an anchoring academic institution for the emerging wellness system in America, MUIH \u00b7 has trained over 2380 wellness professionals and has a current, annual enrollment of over 550 graduate students. Graduates not only help frame-the healthcare options in the U.S. and abroad, but also are instrumental in encouraging people to switch to more natural lifestyle choices that improve their overall health and wellness. This proposal for a new 1 '\u00b7 . MHEC Proposal 2017 MUIH Doctorate in Naturopathic Medicine Doctorate in Naturopathic Medicine (ND) will continue to.advance MUIH's leadership in the emerging wellness system: The American Association of Naturopathic Physicians (AANP) defines naturopathic medicine as \"a distinct primary health care profession, emphasizing prevention and treatment of acute and chronic illness/and restoration of optimal health. Naturopathic physicians employ therapeutic methods and substances that support the inherent self-healing process of nature and the body.\"1 Naturopathic doctors utilize clinical and laboratory diagnostic testing and ~mploy therapeutic modalities in personalized treatment plans, including: clinical nutrition, botanical medicine, physical medicine, counseling, minor surgery, homeopathy, prescription medication, intravenous and injection therapies. Some jurisdictions allow for expanded practice with advanced training and certification, such as acupuncture and natural childbirth. \u00b7 Naturopathic doctors have brought a holistic perspective to healthcare, emphasizing herbal, nutritional, homeopathic, and hands-on therapies that often provide a gentler alternative. to conventional medicine. Trained as first-contact providers, NDs are well positioned to steer patients toward therapeutic interventions that empower the individual, address the whole person and are generally less invasive than most conventional treatments. Some state statutes designate NDs as primary care providers. At present~ NDs are not mandated to practice primary care medicine, and some choose to practice as specialists instead of primary care providers. The growth and evolution of naturopathic medicine have been accelerating, and today, naturopathic doctors can be found in private and integrative practices, primary care and specialty settings, hospitals, the natural products industry, laboratory testing and development, public health, corporate wellness, insurance, health policy, research institutes, think tanks, and academic institutions of all kinds. The culture and philosophy of healing that form the fou.ndation for MUIH programs offer a natural fit for a School of Naturopathic Medicine and will support the integrity of the program. The School of Naturopathic Medicine cultivates a student-centered, holistic approach to naturopathic medical education and facilitates the transformative experiences that define the path to becoming a healer. Instruction will focus on the clinical applications of the biomedical sciences, therapeutic modalities, and clinical sciences, in addition to development of effective communication and leadership skills. Medical technology, genomics, and bioinformatics are explored as .students learn to navigate emerging healthcare trends. Healing presence, wellness, determinants of health, and health creation are emphasized throughout the program, and elements of contemplative education are incorporated into educational activities. 2. Priority and support of institutional strategic goals Consistent with its mission, vision and five-year strategic plan, MUIH recently added doctoral programs in acupuncture, Oriental medicine, and clinical nutrition. The proposed 1 AANP House of Delegates Position Paper (adopted 1989, amended 2011), http://www.naturopathic.org/files/Committees/HOD/Position%20Paper%20Docs/Definition%20Naturopathic%20Medi cine.pdf. 2 ' MHEC Proposal 2017 MUIH Doctorate in Naturopathic Medicin_e {ND) ND program will provide additional educational and career opportunities for healthcare professionals. \u00b7 Since its founding, MUIH has positioned itself as a pioneer and advocate for a more natural and relationship-oriented approach to health and well-being. It has remained steadfast in helping to lead the transformation of our healthcare delivery system through behavioral changes in consumer self-care, teaching MUIH graduates to become partners in health by educating, facilitating and coaching. MUIH's very existence and recent growth offer evidence that our nation1s future model of healthcare will include more, rather than less, integrative health. At their foundation, nearly all of the University's academic and clinical programs, beginning with acupuncture, were intentionally developed to help alter the way healthcare is practiced. Initially, most of these fields lacked an identifiable and ready market both for students and for patients or clients. MUIH took on the challenge of creating both the demand for these academic programs and the consumer base to use the services of their graduates. Introduction of these and more recent market-centric academic offerings, i_ncluding the new doctoral programs, has been quite successful. The ND model, as with all of the disciplines at MUIH, is prevention- and education-oriented, nature-based, community-focused and relationship-centered. With their broad scope of . practice, NDs can help to change the very manner in which healthcare is viewed, understood and practiced. The fact that NDs can already be found in leadership positions in organizations as diverse as think tanks, such as the RAND Corporation; research institutions, including the National Institutes of Health (NIH); hospitals and integrative care centers; accountable care organizations; and institutions of higher learning speaks to the value of their expertise and their role as change agents in the future of healthcare. Further, the ND program affords MUIH an even greater leadership opportunity at the heart of the MUIH mission: it has the potential to positively influence the regional and national landscape of healthcare by offering a broader perspective of natural medicine. By adding the ND program to its academic portfolio, MUIH moves toward much more significant clinical partnerships with patients, as well as with the conventional medical community. Practitioners of integrative health and medicine -and specifically naturopathic doctors -by their very nature will be positioned to take a powerful stand to define, shape and lead the next iteration of healthcare. The ND program will educate graduates to be at the helm beside other healthcare providers and leaders. As a leader in integrative healthcare, MUIH is well positioned and naturally suited to develop this program, before others do. There is a steadily evolving market for naturopathic medicine, including both prospective students \u00b7eager to study in this field and patients demanding ND services. In addition to enhancing MUIH1s national visibility and credibility, the ND program offers MUIH, and all its students and faculty, doctor-level practitioners and partners within the walls of the University. Its students and clinical interns will be visible in its research department, student teaching clihic, and the wellness policy and leadership initiatives that are emerging. The ND progra_m expands and complements MUIH1s curricular content and diversifies ca\u00b7reer options for graduates. It will help to enrich existing programs by offering curricular cross-pollination and opportunities for dual degrees, as well as for 3 MHEC Proposal 2017 MUIH Doctorate in Naturopathic Medicine (ND) interprofessional education, integrative clinical experiences, and collaborative research for all students. B. Adequacy of Curriculum Design and Delivery to Related Learning Outcomes The ND program was constructed around a strategic vision calling for: A naturopathic medical program that is highly competitive, successful, and affordable An innovative curriculum that is in harmony with existing MUIH mission, vision, programs, and philosophy A curriculum delivery plan that is active and experiential to maximi.ze student engagement \u00b7 and enhance learning Integration of existing content from other programs Interprofessional educational opportunities both in classroom and clinical settings .A new standard for excellence in naturopathic medical ~ducation In keeping with those principles, the mission and vision of the School of Naturopathic Medicine were defined: Mission: To prepare graduates to be self-reflective leader~ practitioner~ and change agents in whole person care/. community health and wellness/ research/ and health policy. Vision': We are leaders in the global transformation ofhealth and wellness creation through innovation collaboration and the education ofnaturopathic doctors in the wise practice ofmedicine/ cultivating healing presence and honoring the inherent wisdom ofbody and nature. The resulting program design is for a four-year (11 trimesters), residence-based, graduate-level program in naturopathic medicine leading to a first professional Dodorate of Naturopathic Medicine (ND); Students will typically be on campus five days per week. A significant amount of course material will be available to students online, through recorded lectures, readings, simulations, animations, and videos. Using blended, flipped classroom, and other emergent digitally-enhanced pedagogies, face-to-face class time will largely be reserved for discussion, clarification of challenging concepts, integration, and experiential learnfng. In December 2015, a consultant was hired to provide guidance on future facility needs and to prepare a presentation on the proposed School of Naturopathic Medicine for the Board of\u00b7 Trustees meeting on February 11, 2016, at which formation of the School was approved. In April 2016, the inaugural Dean of the school was hired full-time and began work on establishing a timeline, drafting a curriculum, and networking with prospective faculty and professional and educational partners. Licensed ND consultants were hired to assist with curriculum and course development. In August 2016, the Dean attended the biannual in-person meeting of the Council of Chief Academic and Clinical Officers,\u00b7a subcommittee of the Association of Accredited Naturopathic Medical Colleges, to ascertain the most recent trends, competency development, opportunities, and challenges in naturopathic medical education. Jn subsequent months she met and consulted with key leadership and advisors in naturopathic education, accredftation, administration, and practice, as well as integrative health.

Students will have a clinical component to their studies beginning in the first trimester, and gradually increase their contact and responsibilities with regard to patient care in accordance with their growing knowledge and skills throughout the program. Opportunities for interprofessional education and integrative healthcare teams will be 7 MHEC Proposal 2017 MUIH Doctorate in Naturopathic Medicine (ND} provided in both classroom and clinic. Topics are integrated and anchored by the tutorial sessions (Independent and Collaborative Critical Inquiry, or ICCI) that qccur each trimester through the third year, and provide opportunities for case-based learning through independent and team-based projects, with topics cumulative throughout all three years in order to reinforce the application of biomedical sciences to clinicar sciences and patient care. Concurrently, students explore the personal, professional, technical, and clinical skills, attitudes, and behaviors essential to becoming a competent, compassionate doctor in Practitioner's Journey, which runs every trimester through all four years. In the third and fourth year, Practitioner's Journey incorporates Grand Rounds, including an integrative Grand Rounds that allows interprofessional exploration of patient care with the other MUIH clinical programs. The concept of healing presence, a hallmark of all MUIH programs, is infused throughout the four years: emphasizing the power of relationships to heal and including elements of empathy, self-reflection, and mindfulness. Students complete ~ portfolio of their reflections on the various aspects of relationship-centered care, patient care, personal development, and a service learning project relevant to community medicine. The curriculum is struc;t:ured with a sequential flow that establishes a foundation in the fundamentals of biomedical sciences, naturopathic philosophy, arid integrative therapeutics, in addition to incorporating emerging trends in genomics, bioinformatics, personalized medicine, and practice management. As students progress through the program, emphasis is placed on the clinical applications of the traditions, art, science, and practice of medicine and health creation, as well as the personal transformation of becoming an effective doctor, compassionate healer, and integral member of a patient-centered.team. Course descriptions and sequence for the ND program are provided in Appendix A. While electives are not required, students will have the opportunity to pursue additional degrees, certificates, or courses in _complementary areas offered at MUIH -including acupuncture and Oriental medicine, herbal medicine, clinical nutrition, health and wellness coaching, health promotion, yoga therapy, and research. ' 2. Educational objectives and student learning outcomes Program objectives and learning outcomes for the ND program are based on the three primary domains, which guide the planning, development, instructional delivery\u00b7, and assessment of the naturopathic medical program. In alignment with-those domains, student learning outcomes delineate competencies in the areas of medical knowledge, skills and practice; communication and collaboration; and personal and professional development.

The design and content of the new program conform to CNME standards.5 Subject to approval by MHEC, application will be made for CNME approval of the program in June 2017. 5. Contractual agreement with other institutions MUIH utilizes a two-pronged approach to identifying and establishing contractual agreements with other institutions. The recently established Office of Strategic Partnerships functions on a global level to actively identify and pursue partnerships that could lead to multiple academic placements as well as opportunities for partnership in research and curriculum. Additionally, using a more focused approach, each academic department actively fields external solicitations for partnership and works in collaboration with the Office of Strategic Partnerships to ensure a streamlined process for formalizing placements. Once placements have been identified and vetted through MUIH's administrative and academic leadership, the placements are properly established via contractual agreements that outline the specifics of the placements. \u00b7 Staffing that supports these placements includes: Gail Doerr, Vice President of University and Student Affairs Christina Sax, Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs Louise Gussin, Vice President for Administration and General Counsel Alexandra York, Director for Strategic Partnerships Janet Padgett, Program \u00b7Director for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine Doctoral Programs Rhonda Sapp, Associate Director for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine Programs Claudia Wingo, Program Director for Health Promotion Programs Michael Tims, -Academic Director for Herbal Medicine Elizabeth Owens, Manager of Experiential Programs Nutrition and Integrative Health Aimee McBride, Clinic Coordinator, Yoga Therapy Program A sample agreement that serves as a template for partnering with other institutions can be found in Appendix C. 5 CNME Handbook for Naturopathic Residency Programs, available http://www.cnme.org/resources/2012 cnme residency handbook.pdf. 11 MHEC Proposal 2017 MUIH Doctorate in Naturopathic Medicine (ND) C. Critical and Compelling Regional or Statewide Need as Identified in the State Plan 1. Demand and need for the program The ND program will contribute to the advancement and evolution of knowledge and serve to meet needs for professionals in the emerging field of wellness and relationship-centered healthcare. Today, there is growing interest in moving the field of healthcare toward a system focused on patient satisfaction, outcomes (including cost containment), and population health. Medical silos are disintegrating and the newly emerging medical model is based on collaborative interdisciplinary care teams. In this.environment, the field of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is growing: the National Health Interview Survey in 2012 estimated out-of-pocket expenditures for purchases of CAM products and visits to CAM practitioners at $30.2 billion per year.6 IBISWorld observes: \"The Alternative Healthcare Providers industry is in growth stage of its life cycle. Through 2020, the value the industry adds to the overall economy is forecast to grow an average of 5.1% per year. This rate outpaces growth in US GDP, which IBISWorld projects will increase 2.2% annually on average during same period. The industry is benefiting from mounting acceptance of its safety and efficacy, which is encouraging more . people to use industry (CAM) services.\"7 The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects \"faster than average1 ' growth in positions for naturopathic physicians - 9 to 13 percent during the period 2014-2024.8 . To transform healthcare, \"Naturopathic physicians are a huge part of the solution,\" says Tracy Gaudet, MD, Director of the Veterans Health Administration Office of Patient-Centered Care and Cultural Transformation. They are a \"huge answer for the country, for practice, for patients\" that is available \"at a pivotal transformational moment\" in healthcare.9 Graduates of MUIH's ND program will be at ease with integrative healthcare teams and will graduate with their network already developed. They can be change. agents to help transform healthcare, research, and the health policy of the future; the program's clinical interns and graduates will have an advantage in the marketplace as valued partners in the system. . . Naturopathic medicine is currently a small but growing portion of the healthcare system, with 406 graduates from five U.S. higher education institutions in 2015.10 In addition to Maryland, 21 other U.S. jurisdictions now regulate NDs -most recently, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania -and more are expected to be added in the near fut\u00b5re. The NDs that become licensed in these states will create, deepen and expand public awareness and practice opportunities for the field. As public awareness grows, more states 6 Nahin, Barnes, and Stussman, \"Expenditures on Complementary Health Approaches: United States, 2012, National Health Statistics Reports,\" June 22, 2016, available at https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhsr/nhsr095.pdf. 7 IBISWorld, \"Alternative Healthcare Providers in the US: Market Research Report,\" December 2015. 8 O*Net, u,s, Department of Labor Employment and Training Administration; Occupational Outlook Handbook, U.S. .

Given this predicted expansion, MUIH could be positioned to become the East Coast leader in the field of naturopathic medical education; the only other East Coast university with an ND program, the University of Bridgeport, has not shown intentions for proactive outreach. As new markets open for direct-to-consumer practices by NDs, MUIH will be preparing the best and brightest practitioners. MUIH has current collaborations with both medical systems and community clinics and will be pursuing open dialogues with its medical and health partners on how to best plan for the inclusion of NDs in patient care, particularly in relation to serving high-needs areas and the underserved. There is an opportunity to position the first students and clinical interns as part of a select vanguard group who are eager to collaborate and cooperate for the sake of greater vitality and health for all. Opportunities include strategic partnerships with regional hospitals, integrative medical practices, community clinics, and urgent care centers as well as collaborations with the Maryland Naturopathic Doctors Association. to create preceptorships and residencies. 2. Consistency with the Maryland State Plan for Post-Secondary Education The proposed program will serve the needs of the State of Maryland, consistent with the goals of the Maryland State Plan for Postsecondary Education (Maryland Ready: The 2013-\u00b7 2017 Maryland State Plan for Postsecon.dary Education). Quality and Effectiveness Goal 1 of the 2013-2017 Maryland State Plan for Postsecondary Education is to \"enhance Maryland's array of postsecondary institutions and programs, which are recognized nationally and internationally for academic excellence, and more effectively fulfill the evolving \u00b7educational needs \u00b7of its students, the State, and the nation.\" As a pioneer and driving force for the emerging wellness system, MUIH is uniquely positioned to provide national leadership and training for the elite corps of health and wellness leaders, teachers, practitioners, and researchers that will be needed to support the future of healthcare and a national system of wellness. By offering the ND program, MUIH will add to its portfolio of visionary programs that position Maryland as the national leader in the healthcare industry. MUIH has been an anchoring academic institution in the national movement toward wellness, disease prevention, and relationship-centered healthcare. In research and academia as well as professional practice, credentials are a prerequisite for teaching opportunities and employment. The creation of the ND program is aligned with the State's goal of helping citizens expand their knowledge and supporting their personal, professional, and intellectual advancement in this emerging field. Students will learn from faculty who are experts in their fields . . Economic Growth and Vitality \u00b7 Goal 5 of the Maryland State Plan for Postsecondary Education is to \"stimulate economic growth, innovation, and vitality by supporting a knowledge-based economy, especially 13 MHEC Proposal 2017 MUIH Doctorate in Naturopathic Medicine (ND) through increasing education and training and promoting the advancement and commercialization of research.\" As the State Plan observes, \"An educated workforce that can adapt to changes in the global market is a vital resource in creating and attracting new businesses and in supporting a healthy,\u00b7 knowledge-based .economy.11 This area is achieving increased public interest and has been identified as a high-growth area for employment over the next decade; this will continue as more and more jurisdictions regulate NDs. The proposed ND program meets the intent of this goal by preparing the educated workforce in this field, providing state.-of-the-art curricula and a new level of academic credential in health and wellness. Graduates from the proposed program will help to fill leadership, policy, and teaching roles in this growing sector of the economy. While MUIH plans national recruitment campaigns for the ND program, there will be a specific emphasis on the mid-Atlantic region. Since NDs are licensed to practice in Maryland and since the students will begin their clinical practices and partnerships in the state, there is a strong possibility that the first several cohorts of students will remain Maryland residents. D. Quantifiable and ReUable Evidence and Documentation of Market Supply & Demand in the Region and State \u00b7 1. Market Demand The North American market is growing and changing rapidly. There are 5000 NDs in North America, 3500 of whom are in the United States; the number of NDs has more than tripled over the last decade.11 NDs are trained as primary care, first-contact providers, although they are not always licensed as such. Their full scope of practice can include areas such as prescriptive authority, office procedures, minor surgery, and IV therapy; the scope aliowed varies by jurisdiction. Currently, 22 U.S. jurisdictions license or regulate NDs: Alaska Maine Pennsylvania Arizona Maryland Puerto Rico California Massachusetts Utah Colorado Minnesota Vermont Connecticut Montana U.S. Virgin Islands District of Columbia New Hampshire Washington Hawaii North Dakota Kansas Oregon Naturopathic doctors are required to graduate from a regionally- and programmatically\u00ad accredited four-year residential naturopathic medical school and pass a two-part board examination (Naturopathic Physicians Licensing Examination, or NPLEX) in order to qualify for licensure. Licensed naturopathic doctors must fulfill continuing education requirements annually, as specified by the jurisdiction in which they are licensed, and adhere to a scope of practice defined by their state's law. other states expected to introduce legislation this\u00b7 year to license or regulate NDs include Illinois, New York, Michigan, North. Carolina, New 11 AANMC survey, 2016. 14 MHEC Proposal 2017 M.UIH Doctorate in Naturopathic Medicine (ND) Jersey, Idaho, and Mississippi. California, Washington, and Connecticut already license NDs but will be pursuing scope modernization in 2017. \u00b7 Despite all this activity and interest, there are currently only five regionally- and programmatically-accredited institutions in the United States that offer ND programs: Bastyr University (BU): Kenmore, WA and San Diego, CA \u00b7 National University of Natural Medicine (NUNM): Portland, OR University of Bridgeport College of Nafuropathic Medicine (UBCNM): Bridgeport, CT National University of Health Sciences (NUHS): Lombard, IL Southwest College of Naturopathic Medicine (SCNM): Tempe, AZ An additional ND program is projected to open in 2018: Southern California University of . Health Sciences (SCUHS). There are also two Canadian institutions offering Naturopathic Medicine programs: Boucher Institute of Naturopathic Medicine (BINM) and Canadian College of Naturopathic Medicine (CCNM). Currently, then, most of the available U.S. programs are on the West Coast, and only one in the Eastern U.S. Yet a third of the licensing\u00b7states are in the East and, with the exception of Rhode Island, all of New England now licenses NDs. This offers an opportunity for MUIH to take the lead in offering this educational opportunity to students on the East Coast, and across the country. As the chart below shows, MUIH will be in a strong competitive position in relation to these existing institutions; its cost, student hours, and cohort size will all be on the low end, offering the potential to attract students from a wide geographic area. In Maryland specifically, there is good evidence of growing demand. Maryland began issuing ND licenses in 2016, and there are already 28 licensees in the state. NDs are licensed by the 15 MHEC Proposal 2017 MUIH Doctorate in Naturopathic Medicine (ND) Maryland Board of Physicians, and represented by a Naturopathic Medicine Advisory Committee reporting to the board. In addition, the Maryland Naturopathic Doctors Association (MNDA) was formed in 1997 to meet the professional needs of NDs in the state. Unlike some states, Maryland NDs do not have a scope of practice that fully represents their breadth of training: they may order and perform laboratory and physical examinations; order diagnostic imaging studies and interpret their results; dispense and order natural medicines (e.g., botanical medicines; nutrients, enzymes); offer hydrotherapy, electromagnetic energy, and therapeutic exercise; provide nutrition and couns~ling, and perform naturopathic musculoskeletal mobilization. At present, however, Maryland NDs have no prescriptive authority, and they may not perform high-velocity low-amplitude manual adjustments or minor surgical procedures, nor may they administer IV or injection therapies, as per their training. 2. Educational and training needs, expected vacancies The naturopathic profession has evolved significantly over the past 15-20 years, even more so in the past five years. Increasingly, conventional institutions are recognizing the value of \u00b7naturopathic principles and practice, making NDs extremely relevant to the transforming landscape of healthcare. NDs have made significant inroads into areas traditionally held by conventional practitioners and are increasingly recognized as the experts in natural medicine and valuable team members in the integrative care setting. With this recognition, naturopathic medicine is growing rapidly. There was a 92 percent increase in the number of adult annual visits to NDs between 2002 and 2012.12 O*Net , (Occupational Information Network, U.S. Department of Labor) -identifies it as a new and emerging occupation in a high-growth industry. The job outlook is ranked as \"excellent\" by ExploreHealthCareers.org, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) projects faster than average growth in positions for naturopathic physicians - 9 to 13 percent during the period 2014-2024.13 The ND degree is proving valuable in the evolving healthcare market. A 2015 alumni survey by the Association of Accredited Naturopathic Medical ColJeges (AANMC)14 found 92 percent of respondents using the ND degree in their careers, with. 46 percent considering themselves primary care physicians and 31 percent positioned as adjunctive care/natural health specialists. Ninety percent of them passed their board exams o'n the first attempt, and 58 percent found employment within 3 months of graduation. The mean fulltime salary in the U.S. was $89,392, double their annual pay prior to entering naturopathic medical school. NDs have found their voice and the audience is growing. Career opportunities for students graduating from the ND program include, among others: 12 U.S. bepartment of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics, 2012. 13 O*Net, U.S. Department of Labor Employment and Training Administration; Occupational Outlook Handbook, U.S. Department of Labor Stati~tics; EMSI Analyst. 14 https://aanmc.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/AANMC-2015-Alumni-Survey-Report FINAL-5.9.16.pdf. 16 MHEC Proposal MUIH Doctorate in Naturopathic Medicine (ND) Private practice Multidisciplinary practices (integrative healthcare teams, medical homes, hospitals) Research institutions Natural products industry (sales, research, development) . Laboratory testing and development Education Administration (higher education and educational nonprofits) Public health Insurance/third-party payers Corporate wellness 3. Prospective graduates Nationally, enrollment trends in ND programs are steady and increasing. The existing institutions report that they are meeting their targets, capped programs are full, and the larger institutions are taking in 80-100 students each fall, with small winter cohorts for some programs. The MUIH program has differentiating factors that will support its competitiveness in this positive market: its location; its grounding in MUIH's solid reputation and philosophy; cost and cohort size; and distinctive features of the program experience such as the focus on practitioner development, the tutorial and practitioner's journey courses, healing presence as a hallmark of all MUIH programs, integrative clinic teams and Grand Rounds, early patient experience, bioinformatics for clinicians, and the portfolio and service learning projects. In 2015, there were 406 graduates from the five U.S. universities offering an ND degree. Yet the BLS reports that the 2015 job market included 2,672 new jobs for \"other hea\u00b0lth diagnosing and treating practitioners,\" including NDs; and the 2026 projection is for 9,226. The \"faster than average'; growth projected by the BLS wm include many opportunities for NDs, especially given the rapid growth in the number of states licensing NDs. MUIH is collaborating with the Maryland Naturopathic Doctors Association (MNDA) and regional naturopathic associations to build awareness of the program and identify key. NDs to engage with the program (e.g., ambassadors, clinic sites, faculty, clinicians). Given the solid growth in alternative and integrated healthcare in general, and in. ND opportunities in particular, the following enrollment projections (based on expected completion of the program in four years) call for solid growth over the first five years. PROJECTED ENROLLMENTS FOR PROGRAM 2018-2019 2019-2020 2020-2021 2021-2022 2022-2023 25 48 80 116 129 E. Reasonableness of Program Duplication There are no other ND programs in Maryland. MUIH would be the \u00b7only higher education institution in Maryland and in fact, in much of the surrounding region, to offer an ND program. 17 MHEC Proposal 2017 MUIH Doctorate in Naturopathic Medicine (ND) The next closest universities offering such a program are locate~ in Connecticut and Illinois. F. Relevance to Historically Black Institutions {HBis) There are no ND programs in Maryland HBis. The proposed program will have no potential impact on high-demand programs at the HBis or on the uniqueness and institutional identities and missions of the HBis. G. Evidence of Principles of Good Practice if online The proposed program will not be offered online. However, since part of the program \u00b7(approximately 35 percent) will be delivered in a blended format employing flipped and other emergent digitally enhanced pedagogies, MHEC's Principles of Good Practice for Distance Education are addressed here. MUIH has successfully offered fully online courses and programs since 2013, as approved by both the Maryland Higher Education Commission and the Middle States Commission on Higher Education. Thus, MUIH is well versed in supporting teaching and learning via online and digitally enhanced modalities, and its principles and practices align with MHEC's Principles of Good Practice for Distance Education. At MUIH, online courses are considered to be those in which 100 percent of the teaching and learning process is conducted at a distance, while blended courses are those in which a significant portion of face-to-face instruction is replaced by online or other means of digitally enhanced teaching and learning. Appendix D provides a full description of how this program and others at MUIH comply with the Principles of Good Practice for Distance Education. H. Adequacy of Faculty Resources As with many health professions programs where the curriculum calls for expertise across a broad spectrum of theory and practice, and consistent with the model through which MUIH delivers all its programs, the ND program will rely on a combination of core salaried faculty and the use of part-time adjunct faculty. Salaried full-time faculty will be strategically placed to anchor the program and provide stability and continuity for sfudents across the didactic and clinical education continuum. It is Vital that faculty have practical, general experience, as well as specialization in discrete areas that will allow for expert instruction, supervision, and guidance. All faculty will hold advanced degrees, with at least the equivalent of a master's degree, and the majority of faculty will have a Ph.D., first professional degree, or other terminal degree in their field. A number of potential faculty for this proposed program have.already been teaching at MUIH for years. The senior academic leadership of the university has been involved in advising the development of the program and this proposal, and will continue to support the program once it has launched. 18 MHEC Proposal 2017 MUIH Doctorate in Naturopathic Medicine (ND) The current MUIH budget already accounts for the needed faculty, including twelve FTE faculty by year four. Approval of the proposed budget by the Board of Trustees occurred on October 19, 2016. Criteria for faculty recruitment include: Terminal degree, such as Ph.D., or first professional degree, such as Doctorate in Naturopathic Medicine, Medical Doctor, Doctor of Osteopathy, or Doctor of Chiropractic, with clinical expertise and academic experience. Naturopathic Doctors are preferred and required for some courses. Master's level faculty with extensive experience and expertise may be considered for discrete areas of instruction. Doctors and allied health practitioners must hold a current Maryland license in their discipline~ Qualified to teach graduate courses, and to advise and mentor students. Faculty experience in higher education and, in some cases, a clinical education environment. Experience developing and teaching courses related to the field. Demonstrated commitment to continuing education and professional development. Desire to engage in activities for a new program with a strong we.llness philosophy at its foundation. Research publication and scholarship are preferred but not required. Appendix Econtains a list of representative faculty for the ND program: 21 percent of these are current ranked faculty, 17 percent are current academic administrators with additional teaching responsibilities, and the remaining 62 percent will serve as adjunct faculty (based on enrollment-driven needs). I. Adequacy of Library Resources The Sherman Cohn Library at MUIH has a total collection of over 18,000 titles in health and wellness (13,000 physical holdings and 5,000 electronic). A current shelf analysis of in-house, print materials specifically in support of the naturopathic medicine program includes approximately 300 resources. Electronic resources augment the number of health and wellness materials available. The Library's computerized systems and, where applicable, licensing agreements with vendors permit access to open-access journals and other free Internet resources, as well as selected journal articles from individual subscriptions and from the Library's EBSCO host databases. The Library uses the National Library of Medicine's Decline service for document delivery. When the Library does not own an article, it can be obtained in atimely manner for faculty and students through the-Library's use of Docline. The Sherman Cohn Library at MUIH has and will continue to expand to support all modalities of teaching and learning, as well as moderate enrollment growth. In FY 2014, the University added online support for faculty and students with a newly purchased and 19 MHEC Proposal 2017 MUIH Doctorate in Naturopathic Medicine (ND} significantly enhanced integrated library system. All online courses contain a direct link to the Sherman Cohn Library at MUIH, prominently positioned in online classrooms. In 2016, the University opened a Quiet Study Room associated with Sherman Cohn Library that addressed students' expressed need for a place to work ih silence. The Library is located in a single room and fosters an information commons environment. To learn about the reso_urces, space, and staff levels that might be needed in association with the ND program, the Library created and distributed a survey to six universities offering doctoral degrees in Naturopathic Medicine in October 2016. The survey collected data on the library user groups; nature of responsibility for resources used by students; supporting media and subscriptions; budget for program materials; consortia memberships; facilities for students such as study and work rooms, labs and academic support centers; supporting library staff; and specifics on critical resources. The results are being used to guide Library planning \u00b7and budgeting for support of the ND program. J. Adequacy of \u00b7Facilities, Infrastructure, and Equipment MUIH's 12-acre campus contai_ns a 32,500 square-foot, two-story building, herbal medicine teaching garden, parking for.all students, and ample space for additional buildings to be built in order to accommodate growth. Over 300 people can be accommodated in the current building's large event space, which totals 2,750 square feet. The current building serves as the primary .home for all of MUIH's programs, and includes: Eight classrooms and a ninth, multipurpose space; An herbal dispensary; A library; A quiet study room; 22 clinical treatment rooms; Space for faculty offices; . A faculty kitchen; A student lounge with an adjacent kitchen; A bookstore/cafe that includes seating All 22 clinical treatment rooms are assigned to the Student Teaching Clinic. These treatment rooms are used by students during the clinical phase of various programs, and will be shared with the ND program. Designated treatment rooms have already been configured to meet the needs of the ND program. All classrooms have access to voice and data communications and WiFi is available throughout the building. Two large, dividable classrooms are equipped with ceiling-mounted data projectors and screens, as well as an integrated sound system. A portable sound system, TV, laptops, and overhead and LCD projectors are available for use in classrooms as needed. In addition, the university intends to lease and outfit a minimum of 19,000 square feet of new space in Howard County for classrooms, labs, offices, and student areas for the ND program~ A number of possible venues have been identified and are under exploration. The university will purchase new instructional equipment for the classrooms, labs, and student areas to meet the specific needs of the ND program, as well as the furniture and technology needed to equip the office space which will be used by faculty and administration of the ND program. These 20 MHEC Proposal 2017 MUIH Doctorate in Naturopathic Medicine (ND) expenses are included in the. budget approved by the Board of Trustees on October 19, 2016, and provided in this proposal.This space is sufficient to meet the needs of the program. Other offices for general administration of the university and faculty of other programs will continue to be located at the current campus locations. New staff will be needed to launch the ND program, given that analogous programs do not already exist at MUIH and 129. new enrollments are projected over the first five years of the program (section D.3). As noted above, MUIH intends to acquire the needed space and equipment (section J) and Library resources (section I). New staff specific to the ND program will be hired in a phased-in approach during the first three years of the program, including an Associate Dean for Academics, an Associate Dean for Clinical Education, a Clinic Coordinator, and an Administrative Support staff member. Students enrolled in the early years of the ND. program will be served by the current infrastructure including admissions, registrar, advising, student. services, and academic support. Additional staff will be hired as needed as enrollments grow. In particular, the university intends to add staff in advising, admissions, library, student services, tutoring, instructional technology, information technology, and the Natural Care Center clinic during the first three years of the program. These new staff expenses are included in the budget approved by the Board of Trustees on October 19, 2016, and provided in this proposal. K. Adequacy of Financial Resources Table 1: Resources Reallocated funds During the start-up phase of the program, the \u00b7university\u00b7 will reallocate funds from general operation to support this new program. This reallocation of funds will not have an adverse impact on existing programs since the university operates with a net surplus sufficient to reallocate the necessary funds to the new program. Tuition and Fee Revenue The intake assumptions for years 1 through 5 are 25, 25, 35, 40, and 40. Most ND programs throughout the country have annual intakes between 40 and 110 students. The projected intake is conservative to reflect the launch of a new program and a ramp up in the later years. The model also accounts for a modest level of attrition of students prior to completion of their program (average attrition rate of six percent for all students across the first five years of the program launch). Table 2: Expenditures New and/or renovated space \u00b7 The university plans to lease new space for classrooms, labs, offices, and student areas. The university intends to lease at least 19,000 square feet in Howard County, which should be sufficient to meet the needs of this program. \u00b7 21 MHEC Proposal 2017 MUIH Doctorate in Naturopathic Medicine (ND) Other Expenses Other expenses in~lude faculty development, travel, memberships, office supplies, data processing and communications, maintenance, marketing, course development costs, and building operating costs.

Total Salary 90,900 Library 47,500 54,500 79,000 provisions for evaluation of program Since its establishment, MUIH has nurtured a culture of assessment and feedback. Expected student learning outcomes are clearly stated at the course and programmatic. levels, and these outcomes are well designed to align with the University's Mission and the School of Naturopathic Medicine's Mission, as well as the standards established by the Council on Naturopathic Medical Education and the Association of Accredited Naturopathic. Medical Colleges and higher education in general. Learning outcomes assessment is multilevel and predominantly utilizes a 360-degree design. Course outcomes and measures are consistent with the specific subject matter, and the achievement of outcomes is documented from both the faculty and student perspectives. Programmatic outcomes that emerge from the integrated learning environment and are not course-specific are assessed through comprehensive exams and projects, clinical evaluations, portfolios, peer-to-peer evaluations, patient outcomes and feedback, licensure examina~ions, retention rates, and graduate surveys. The academic departments, programs, and curriculum committees, subject matter experts (SMEs), and faculty responsible for designing, delivering, and assessing learning outcomes receive support from a 360-degree team. This team is led by the Learning Outcomes Assessment Team (LOAT), which serves as an umbrella committee to guide and facilitate academic assessment initiatives. Additional support is provided by the Assistant Provost for Academic Assessment and Accreditation, University Curriculum Committee, Student Affairs, Alumni Affairs, Natural Care Center clinic administration, and the Provost in gathering and 23 . MHEC Proposal 2017 MUIH Doctorate in Naturopathic Medicine (ND) interpreting assessment results. The involvement of all of these groups in assessment practices demonstrates that MUIH invests necessary institutional resources and is committed to outcomes assessment. In 2011, MUIH piloted and then adopted the IDEA Student Rating of Instruction tool as the system students would use to evaluate courses and faculty. IDEA is a nonprofit organization whose mission has been to provide assessment and feedback systems to improve learning in higher education. The IDEA tool meets the needed and desired criteria for a sustainable course evaluation system that was previously identified by the LOAT Committee. Further, the IDEA system is based on 26 years of research and allows the institution to compare faculty performance within similar disciplines and among over 400 other universities. In 2016, MUIH shifted its use of the IDEA tool to the Campus Labs online platform, allowing for use of this tool by students in face-to-face, blended, and online classes alike. The proposed ND program will utilize comprehensive assessments to evaluate cumulative understanding at key transition points throughout didactic and clinical education, as \u00b7 summarized below. In addition, a student portfolio will begin .in Year One and be assessed periodically throughout the program, with a service-learning capstone project assessed in the final year. Year One: Comprehensive basic sciences exam to assess student knowledge and understanding of biomedical sciences Portfolio assessment of student self-awareness, self-'care practices, reflections, and critical thinking Clinical Skills Exam (CSE), a practical exam to assess entry-level clinical encounter skills, including patient intake, assessment, differ~ntial diagnosis, and physical examination CSE Student Self-Evaluation Year Two: .Clinic Readiness Exam (CRE), a written exam to assess student knowledge and understanding of biomedical sciences, medical ethics, clinic procedures, standardized regulations associated with clinical practice, and medical coding CRE Student Self-Evaluation \u00b7 Naturopathic Physicians Licensing Exam Part I Portfolio assessment of student self-awareness, self-care practices, reflections, and critical thinking Year Three: Clinic Promotion Exam (CPE), an assessment of clinical encounter skills, including patient intake, clinical reasoning, assessment, differential diagnosis, therapeutics, comprehensive physical examination, and charting CPE Student Self-Evaluation e CPE Standardized Patient Evaluation of Student Portfolio assessment of student self-awareness, self-care practices, reflections, critical thinking, and clinical reasoning 24 MHEC Proposal 2017 MUIH Doctorate in Naturopathic Medicine (ND) Year Four: Clinic Exit Exam (CEE), a comprehensive written and practical assessment of clinical encounter skills, including patient intake, clinical reasoning, assessment, differential diagnosis, therapeutics, physical examination, charting, and interprofessional collaboration and referral practices CEE Student Self-Evaluation CEE Standardized Patient Evaluation of Student Service-learning project assessing student integration of determinants of health, cultural competence, bioinformatics, and naturopathic medicine in the community healthcare setting \u00b7 Final portfolio assessment of student self-awareness, self-care practices, reflections, critical thinking, clinical reasoning, and professionalism Post Graduation: Naturopathic Physicians Licensing Examination Part II Alumni Survey Outcomes assessment in the didactic portion of the curriculum is ongoing and based on the academic performance of students, as well as communication, collaboration, and leadership qualities and behaviors assessed by peers in tutorial sessions and the clinical setting. Outcomes assessment in the MUIH student clinics is multifactorial and will include ongoing assessment by Clinical SL1pervisors, standardized patients, and clinic staff; self\u00ad assessment, patient outcomes assessment, and standardized clinical assessments. Clinical Supervisors in the proposed ND program will complete written, standardized reports utilizing direct and indirect measurements of students' clinical skills, clinical reasoning, patient management, peer and interprofessional collaboration, and participation in case discussions.
