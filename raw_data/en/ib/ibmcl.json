Only information revealed to me will be passed on with no judgments, if the client is not \"supposed\" to have information, it will not be revealed to me by Spirit. The success of the Spiritual Communication is not just down to Spirit and I, but also down to the clients themselves having an open mind and leaving pre-conceived ideas behind. All readings are sincere, confidential, carried out with truth and love. Spiritual Healing \u00a3 45.00 45Mins Spiritual Healing is a natural energy therapy where healing energy is channelled or flows through me during the treatment. The benefits of the healing treatment can be felt on many levels, not just the physical and supports all forms of treatment both orthodox and complementary. Spiritual Healing can complement conventional medicine by treating the person as a whole. It can help the body to relax, releases tension and stimulates the body to self-heal. Also helps with anxiety, depression, well being and grounding. Can't find what you're looking for?
