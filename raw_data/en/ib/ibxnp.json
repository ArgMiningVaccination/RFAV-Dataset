In the parasympathetic state, your *vagus nerve releases the neurotransmitter acetylcholine to the sinoatrial node of the heart signaling it to prolong the time to the next heartbeat, thus slowing the pulse. *The vagus nerve, is the longest of 12 cranial nerves. There are actually two vagus nerves\u2014the left and right\u2014but both are often talked about as one. Latin, the word \"vagus\" means \"wandering.\" The vagus nerve wanders through the body, from the brainstem to the heart, lungs, stomach, digestive tract, liver, kidneys and spleen. It works with the parasympathetic system, responsible for the \"rest-and-digest\" response. In this system, it regulates internal organ functions, like digestion, heart rate and respiratory rate. To stimulate the vagus nerve and trigger the parasympathetic response, topically apply 1 drop Equilibrium with a carrier oil behind each earlobe over the mastoid bone where the vagus nerve travels downward behind both ears. This triggers the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine which helps slow your heart beat, reducing the amount of blood pumped through the arteries with every beat, helping lower blood pressure naturally. The parasympathetic nervous system also calms inflammation which supports blood pressure. Inflammation in the arteries over time contributes to high blood pressure. Calming inflammation lowers blood pressure. Equilibrium Blend is well suited to calm high blood pressure. One reason why - Clove oil. Clove contains a high percentage of the chemical constituent eugenol. Eugenol has been shown to reduce the amount of blood flow through vessels and specifically, may act as a calcium channel blocker, preventing the mineral from entering the cells of blood vessel walls. In a similar way, Lime essential oil (also found in Equilibrium) is said to have stress-reducing properties. Cypress oil helps support circulation, helping the veins contract, making it easier to stimulate blood flow. Add 1 drop to carrier oil, apply at brain stem.
