The use of crystals dates all the way back 6,000 years ago to the ancient Sumerians in Mesopotamia. Since then, crystals have been used in one form or another in countless ancient cultures such as in Egypt, China, Rome, Greece, and South America. The Science Behind Crystals While the healing properties of crystals have not yet been extensively researched or proven, we do know that crystals possess a unique electrical charge known as piezoelectricity. Basically, piezoelectricity is an electrical charge that is emitted from crystals once they are pressed or cut. Just think of a lighter; once you press down on its button, a flame erupts. In this case, the crystal is the lighter, your hand presses against the crystal, and an electrical charge is emitted. [Researchers](http://www.computerworld.com/article/2483919/emerging-technology/-superman--crystals-could-store-360tb-of-data-forever.html) have also been able to demonstrate that synthetic crystals can store data, which could explain why certain crystals have specific qualities or \"personalities.\" Metaphysically, crystals vibrate at their own frequencies as everything is composed of energy. When introduced to our own energy fields, crystals create larger vibrational fields and affect our nervous systems through the Law of Resonance. These shifting vibrations can help to stimulate a number of mind-body forms of healing. 8 Powerful Crystals For Inner Work I often use crystals to enhance my feeling of being grounded, centered, and connected to my Soul. Not only are crystals energetically-rich, but they are also deeply enmeshed with meaning and significance.
