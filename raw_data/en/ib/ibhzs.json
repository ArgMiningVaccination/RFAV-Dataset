Available online & in stores. Our Pet Stylists are passionate about pets! To maintain a safe, comfortable environment, we require all pets to be current on their rabies vaccinations and to wait at least 48 hours after any vaccinations before checking in. Proof of rabies vaccination in the form of paperwork is required. The waiting period helps to ensure your pet isn't sore at the injection site, which can cause irritability or lethargy. This waiting period also is to prevent stressing a pet who may be experiencing an unexpected allergic reaction from a vaccine/vaccination. Puppies and kittens between 8 weeks and 4 months of age (3 months in Indiana) may receive services in the salon without vaccinations. In New York City, 6-month Bordetella and DHPP with Adenovirus are also required. In Iowa, DPP with Adenovirus is required. In Connecticut, proof of town license is required. Please note: All pets must be in good health prior to receiving any grooming services. At the top of the screen you will see \"Click Appointment or Check Prices.\" Select the dog or cat icon based on your pet. Select breed and age. Then click \"Check Prices.\" The Grooming Salon Menu on the right side of the screen will populate with estimated pricing for all services available for your pet. Once a service is selected, you will go to the Service log-in page to continue your booking. You'll be prompted to sign into your PetSmart account or sign up and provide your name, your pet's information, and your email address to get started. You can book your favorite Pet Stylist, check availability, make appointments and sign up for text alerts. Booking an appointment for a grooming service ahead of time ensures that you and your pet are not kept waiting any longer than necessary. Weekends tend to be especially busy, so appointments are highly recommended on Saturdays and Sundays. We're happy to take walk-ins when we have availability. Please note: All cat services require specially trained associates to complete, are not available on weekends and are only available at select salons. Call your salon ahead of time to ensure a certified cat groomer is available. Prices for base packages are based on breed, condition of coat and length of service. In order to get a price estimate before your appointment, we recommend booking your appointment online or calling your salon. This is our promise to you that you'll love how your pet looks after a visit to our salon, or we'll do whatever it takes to make it right. The amount of time it takes for pet grooming varies by breed and service, but you can usually plan on it taking 3-4 hours. Express services can be arranged upon request, shortening service time. Minor services, such as nail trims, take approximately 15 minutes and no appointment is necessary (subject to salon availability). Wait time may apply. Express services are available for senior dogs and dogs who get anxious during grooming services and are required for the following breeds: French Bulldog, English Bulldog, Pugs, Boxers & Boston Terriers. Ask a grooming associate for details. We select the appropriate drying method for each pet based on a variety of factors including hair type, breed, age and behavior. We do not kennel dry any Brachiocephalic dogs or cats. For those pets we do kennel-dry and have safety procedures specific to kennel dryers that are designed to keep pets safe. We do not use kennel dryers with heating elements. All our dryers are placed on automatic shut off timers and we often combine multiple drying techniques to minimize the drying time. If you have any questions about our policy or would like to discuss the best drying process for your dog, please be sure to speak with a pet stylist when booking your dog grooming appointment. Yes, pets are cared for in our state-of-the-art kennels and water is always provided. We keep kennel time as minimal as possible, and there is someone on hand to check on your pet frequently. Express services are available for senior dogs and dogs who get anxious during grooming services. Breeds that require an express service (French Bulldogs, English Bulldogs, Pugs, Boxers & Boston Terriers) spend little to no time in a kennel. Ask a grooming associate for details. Yes, our Grooming Salons have a viewing area for you to comfortably watch your dog or cat getting groomed. For the safety of pets, however, we don't allow pet parents to assist with the grooming process or to stay in the grooming kennel or bathing areas. We never sedate pets, nor do we accept pets who have been sedated. If your dog or cat has been known to have a strong behavioral reaction to grooming or bathing, please advise us when making the appointment and when dropping off. If a pet is truly uncooperative or made uncomfortable by the process, we might end the session - but we will never sedate your pet. We ensure that each professional pet stylist is qualified to care for your pet. Academy-trained stylists complete over 800 hours of hands-on instruction and safety certification, working with at least 200 dogs of all breeds and sizes. Because we pride ourselves on having the highest safety standards in the industry, PetSmart requires every salon associate to be safety certified annually. At check-in, a safety-certified salon associate will perform a thorough Hands-On Pet Assessment to address your pet's unique needs. During this assessment, we will check your pet's skin, coat, ears, nails and teeth in order to customize your pet's service just for them. PetSmart Grooming Salons proudly carry FRONTLINE\u00ae Plus. The solution can be purchased in our store and then brought into the Grooming Salon for application, or you can purchase a Flea & Tick Package and we will provide the FRONTLINE\u00ae Plus solution for your pet. If you are looking for a more natural option, we now offer Only Natural Pet flea & tick repellant in our Grooming Salons as well! Please note: FRONTLINE\u00ae Plus is not available in NJ, NY, IN or Canada. In these areas, consult your salon for other treatment options. We offer an express service solely for the following breeds: English Bulldogs, French Bulldogs, Pugs, Boxers and Boston Terriers (and any dog mixed with one of these breeds). These specific breeds are more likely to experience respiratory challenges, particularly in unfamiliar environments, and for some dogs, this includes places like a grooming salon. Our standard for these breeds features an uninterrupted service provided by a dedicated grooming professional, limiting the amount of time your pet will spend in the salon. When the groom is complete, your pet will be returned to you right away, so we will ask you to stay in or near the store during your pet's appointment. At check-in, a safety-certified salon associate will perform a teeth-to-tail hands-on assessment of your pet. We will closely observe pets for any combination of the following: If your pet is showing any two of these behaviors, we will not be able to perform the service at that time. Pet parents are welcome to stay in the store with their pet to see if the behaviors pass after 15 minutes. If not, we will gladly reschedule the appointment at a less busy time or recommend a veterinarian who can perform the service. Pets who have recently been vaccinated, have active infections or have underlying health issues are at higher risk of injury from stress. Older pets, those with special challenges, pets who have recently experienced stressful life changes or injuries are at higher risk of experiencing stress or aggravating a condition during grooming. Be sure to flag any special conditions with your groomer and note all pertinent information on the provided salon card. It takes a special set of skills to help pets look and feel their best. At PetSmart, our professional Pet Stylists will do anything for your pet. Our groomers use specially formulated pet shampoos and conditioners to help soothe and improve skin and coat. No matter the breed\u2014whether you have a dog or cat with an undercoat, a curly mane, short hair, long hair or no hair\u2014our Grooming Academy-Trained Pet Stylists are skilled and experienced, no matter the task.
