Roughly [2.7%](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/panic-disorder) of adults in the United States had a panic disorder in the past year, and it's estimated that [4.7%](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/panic-disorder) of U.S. adults will have a panic disorder sometime in their lives. [44.8%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2847357/) of people with panic disorder report that it severely impairs their ability to do the things they love and that are important to them. Panic attacks are also far more than a personal issue; anxiety disorders cost up to $1 trillion in lost [productivity](https://nami.org/mhstats?) globally. Thankfully, there are a number of incredibly effective solutions for managing and healing panic disorder! (Mary's [story](https://www.rupahealth.com/post/a-functional-medicine-approach-to-panic-attacks), for example, shows that an integrative approach can effectively eliminate panic attacks in just a few weeks). In this article, we'll explore the root causes of panic attacks and which functional medicine treatments can help you heal to get you thriving once again. [signup] What is a Panic Attack? Panic attacks are sudden and intense, involuntary [episodes](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/panic-disorder-when-fear-overwhelms) of physical and emotional symptoms that can last for a few seconds or for many minutes. They always involve the emotional sensation of intense fear as well as the sense of being out of control. Panic Attack Symptoms Panic attacks can involve a wide range of physical and psychological symptoms that can leave people [feeling](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/panic-disorder-when-fear-overwhelms) as if they're losing control or even dying. Panic attacks symptoms can [include](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/anxiety-disorders#part_2223): - Heart palpitations - Sweating - Trembling - Chest pain - Detachment from reality - Fear or a sense of impending doom - Breathlessness - Dizziness - Physical compliance like stomach aches People who have had panic attacks can become debilitated when they're happening - unable to do anything else than try to manage until the panic attack is over. It's common for people with panic disorder to experience anxiety and [worry](https://www.rupahealth.com/post/an-integrative-approach-to-mental-health) that they'll have another attack. Because of this, they can start to avoid people or situations that they fear will cause a panic attack, and this avoidance can disrupt day-to-day living, such as work, school, and social relationships. Some people who have panic attacks also report other [conditions](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7430397/#B01) like agoraphobia, social phobia, or [substance](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3395763/) abuse. Thankfully, there are effective options for managing panic attacks to eliminate these symptoms, ease worry, and get folks with panic disorder back to living fully without fear. How to Stop a Panic Attack Breathing techniques like paced breathing, cognitive behavioral exercises, and pharmaceutical medications like the ones covered later in this article can be used alone or together to [stop](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7104662/) a panic attack in the moment. Your integrative team will help you develop a unique plan to stop your panic attack based on your root causes and preferences. What Causes a Panic Attack? The exact causes of panic attacks are not fully known, but they are likely caused by several factors rather than a single incident. Some panic attacks can be attributed to neurotransmitter imbalances, nutrient deficiencies, hormone issues, histamine disorders, mineral deficiencies, vestibular or [breathing](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6628946/) issues, or environmental/psychological factors. Before delving into root causes, your practitioner will check to see if you have any [medical](https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/view/7-medical-illnesses-may-present-anxiety?slide=1) conditions that might cause symptoms similar to panic attacks: heart disease, endocrine imbalances, gastrointestinal disorders, metabolic conditions, and others. Once those are ruled out, you'll explore other possible causes together. Nutrient Deficiencies Several nutrient [deficiencies](https://www.rupahealth.com/post/a-functional-medicine-approach-to-treating-panic-attacks) are linked to panic attacks \u2014 especially a lack of [antioxidants](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3964744/), vitamins C and E, iron, zinc, selenium, and [omega-3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2275606/) fatty acids. It's theorized that a lack of these vital nutrients contributes to [oxidative](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4417658/) stress and impaired neurotransmitter function, which can result in mental health issues. Hormonal Issues Some hormonal issues, such as hyperthyroidism or [Graves'](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8162004/) disease, can mimic panic attacks, causing insomnia, heartbeat irregularities, anxiety, and sweating. Others, like adrenal issues or [Cushing's](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4403344/) syndrome, manifest as weight gain, sleep issues, immune system concerns, and more and can be misinterpreted as panic attacks. People who experience the cycling of progesterone and estrogen during the [menstrual](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3176921/) cycle may also notice their panic attacks are tied to hormone fluctuations. Neurotransmitter Imbalances [Neurotransmitters](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK539894/) help neurons communicate using chemical messages to transfer information. Some neurotransmitters involved in panic disorder include [serotonin](https://www.rupahealth.com/post/how-to-increase-your-serotonin-naturally), [norepinephrine](https://www.rupahealth.com/post/adrenaline), and [GABA](https://www.rupahealth.com/post/5-natural-ways-to-increase-low-gaba-levels). People with panic disorder have [decreased](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3758115/) levels of the calming neurotransmitter GABA in their anterior cingulate cortex and medial prefrontal cortex - parts of the brain involved in estimating and responding to risk. SSRIs - which modulate serotonin receptor activity - are among the most [effective](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35045991/) pharmaceuticals for managing panic disorder. Mineral Deficiencies Deficiencies in minerals like [iron](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23603926/) can cause people to experience panic attacks more frequently than those who are not anemic. People with panic disorder are more likely to be [zinc](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19582379/) deficient than those without it. Environmental Factors Exposure to select substances may worsen panic attacks. For example, [substance](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK430973/) abuse, ingesting [caffeine](https://www.rupahealth.com/post/its-time-to-start-treating-coffee-like-a-health-food) at a level of five or more cups of coffee a day, or other stimulants can trigger or worsen panic attacks. [Heavy metal](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8376242/) exposures have also been associated with an increased risk of panic disorders. Trauma Our brains are wired to [remember](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31952856/) scary or frightening events so that we can protect ourselves from similar harm in the future. Sometimes, these memories can trigger sympathetic nervous system responses that aren't helpful once the danger has passed. Panic attacks can co-occur with PTSD symptoms like flashbacks and can be [treated](https://www.psychiatria-danubina.com/UserDocsImages/pdf/dnb_vol30_noSuppl%205/dnb_vol30_noSuppl%205_326.pdf) using similar approaches. Functional Medicine Labs to Test for Root Causes of Panic Attacks Your practitioner will evaluate your individual situation and then recommend tests to get to the root cause of your panic attacks. Depending on your history and symptoms, you may be tested for the following: Nutrient Deficiencies Testing for nutrient deficiencies can include at-home blood [spot](https://www.rupahealth.com/lab-tests/vibrant-wellness-whole-blood-nutrient-profile) tests or blood [draws](https://www.rupahealth.com/lab-tests/vibrant-america-nutrition-panel) at a local lab to delve into nutrients, [micronutrients](https://www.rupahealth.com/lab-tests/vibrant-america-micronutrients-panel), and other biomarkers. Hormonal Issues Comprehensive [hormone](https://www.rupahealth.com/lab-tests/dutch-dutch-complete-dried-urine) panels can assess the fluctuations of progesterone, testosterone, DHEA, cortisol, and estrogen throughout the month using saliva and urine. Snapshots of hormone levels can also be assessed using a [blood ](https://www.rupahealth.com/lab-tests/vibrant-america-hormones-panel)draw. Your practitioner may also seek a complete picture of your [thyroid](https://www.rupahealth.com/post/a-functional-medicine-approach-to-thyroid-hormone-labs) function by [testing](https://www.rupahealth.com/lab-tests/access-medical-labs-thyroid-panel-comprehensive) for TSH, Free T4, Free T3, and Reverse T3. Neurotransmitter Imbalance To help provide a complete picture of your unique metabolism of the inhibitory, excitatory, and other [neurotransmitters](https://www.rupahealth.com/post/a-functional-medicine-approach-to-understanding-neurotransmitters-101), your practitioner can use a urine [test](https://www.rupahealth.com/lab-tests/vibrant-wellness-neurotransmitters) or order a [test](https://www.rupahealth.com/lab-tests/doctors-data-comprehensive-neurotransmitter-add-on-random) to measure neurotransmitter metabolites to understand how your body is processing the neurotransmitters. Lifestyle Factors In order to see if environmental or lifestyle factors are contributing to your panic attacks, your practitioner will sit down with you to do a deep dive into your general and psychological health. Follow-up tests may include [substance](https://www.rupahealth.com/lab-tests/access-medical-labs-drugs-of-abuse-screen-urine) screening to see if intervention recommendations are warranted or testing for toxins like heavy [metals](https://www.rupahealth.com/lab-tests/doctors-data-hair-elements), which can impact mental health. Additional Labs to Check You've likely had a [CBC](https://www.rupahealth.com/lab-tests/vibrant-america-cbc) (complete blood count) and [CMP](https://www.rupahealth.com/lab-tests/access-medical-labs-comprehensive-metabolic-panel) (complete metabolic panel) at your yearly check-up; if not, your practitioner will order those, as well, to check for underlying medical conditions. In some cases, based on your history and symptoms, additional recommendations might include a [cardiac](https://www.rupahealth.com/lab-tests/vibrant-america-cardiac-health-panel) health panel along with an electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) to measure heart health and to rule that out as a reason for panic attack-like symptoms. [signup] Conventional Treatment for Panic Disorders Many people begin healing with psychotherapy and medications, which are the conventional treatments for panic attacks. These methods can be extremely helpful for many. Psychotherapy There are multiple types of psychotherapy that can help people conquer panic attacks and take back their lives. Cognitive-behavioral therapy ( [CBT](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4610618/)) has been shown to reduce or eliminate panic attacks effectively. It allows individuals to identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors. Additionally, Exposure Therapy \u2014 gradually exposing people to situations that make them fearful while supporting the client with therapeutic companionship, tools, and more \u2014 can also help reduce panic attacks. Eye-movement desensitization reprocessing therapy (also known as EMDR) has recently been shown to be as [effective](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5563354/) as CBT in reducing panic attacks. EMDR involves using eye movements, grounding techniques, and alternating sensations or movements to help the brain disconnect the trigger for emotional responses to thoughts and memories. Medications for Panic Disorders Sometimes, [medications](https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2015/0501/p617.html) are prescribed to help reduce the frequency and severity of panic attacks. Antidepressants like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and benzodiazepines work regulating neurotransmitters serotonin and GABA in the brain. SSRIs are used daily, while certain medications like benzodiazepines can be used as [needed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6097846/) for preventing or treating panic attacks. Functional Medicine Treatment to Manage Panic Disorders Naturally Using a root cause approach, your practitioner can work with you on effective [treatment](https://www.rupahealth.com/post/a-functional-medicine-approach-to-treating-panic-attacks) options to resolve panic disorders \u2014 sometimes along with conventional treatments. Some people wonder if functional medicine treatments can be used instead of pharmaceuticals. For many people, they're safe and effective protocols. For others, they're a great addition to their treatment plan. Armed with the information from functional and conventional tests, your practitioner will design an individualized plan that might include a functional medicine approach alone or one that works alongside medications and therapy. Nutrition to Reduce Anxiety and Panic Attacks Whole foods diets like the Mediterranean diet are [shown](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8453603/) to improve mental health conditions in general, including anxiety, and may benefit people with panic disorder. Making the switch to an anti-inflammatory diet can sound intimidating, but it doesn't have to be hard. It can be easy, fun, and delicious if you follow the tips in this awesome [article](https://www.rupahealth.com/post/4-science-backed-health-benefits-of-the-mediterranean-diet) on the Mediterranean diet. A trained practitioner can review your test results to design a customized food-as-medicine meal plan to replete micronutrient deficiencies that may be contributing to panic disorder. This might include increasing sources of nutrients like iron, omega-3s, or zinc, depending on what your current diet lacks. Supplements and Herbs to Help With Anxiety In some cases, targeted nutrition [supplements](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6628946/) may also be part of a nutrition strategy. Inositol [Inositol](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7793450/), for example, is a nutrient that is effective for reducing panic attacks when used consistently for over a month. Omega-3s [Omega-3s](https://www.rupahealth.com/post/omega-3s-the-superfood-nutrient-you-need-to-know-about) - a type of fatty acid usually derived from fish, walnuts, chia seeds, or flax seeds - can help [improve anxiety](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2275606/) when taken at doses of 2000mg per day. Magnesium [Magnesium](https://www.rupahealth.com/post/magnesium-101) has been shown to benefit mild [anxiety](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9292249/) and stress-associated mood disorders, especially when combined with vitamin B6. Passionflower Passionflower appeared in one [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2959081/) to be as effective at reducing anxiety symptoms as pharmaceutical benzodiazepines. Please work with your practitioner before swapping out any medications for herbs, as it may not be appropriate in all cases. Kava [Kava](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2959081/) root has been used for centuries to reduce anxiety and may relieve anxiety symptoms without the side effects typical of many anxiety medications, like fatigue. It can cause liver damage if used in excessive amounts long-term and is not safe for people with compromised liver function. Lavender [Lavender](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S094471130900261X) oil is as effective at reducing anxiety as the popular benzodiazepine Ativan. Please do not attempt to swap out any medications for herbs without the assistance of your practitioner, as it may not be appropriate for everyone. Ashwagandha [Ashwagandha](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ptr.7598) was found in a 2022 systematic review to significantly reduce anxiety and perceived stress at doses between 300mg and 12,000mg per day. Individual dosing will depend on your unique physiology and needs. Hormone Optimization Your practitioner may recommend hormone [replacement](https://www.rupahealth.com/post/the-pros-and-cons-of-hormone-replacement-therapy-an-integrative-medicine-approach) or develop a protocol to increase normal hormone [production](https://www.rupahealth.com/post/a-functional-medicine-approach-to-thyroid-hormone-labs) using a [combination](https://www.rupahealth.com/post/understanding-the-link-between-womens-mental-health-and-hormones) of [lifestyle](https://www.rupahealth.com/post/exercise-affects-on-womens-hormones), nutrients, and supplements. In some cases, your practitioner may refer you to an endocrinologist if your issue is hormonal in order to develop an integrative plan that includes hormone replacement. Neurotransmitter Optimization Researchers have [found](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4417658/) that improved sleep and stress management, and supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins C and B12, folic acid, zinc, magnesium, and CoQ10, can help to reduce oxidative stress and optimize levels of GABA, serotonin, and dopamine, with beneficial effects on mental health. Minerals and Heavy Metals Your practitioner may recommend calcium, zinc, [magnesium](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5452159/), or other supplements based on your specific needs. If heavy metals are present, your practitioner may use a chelation agent supplemented with antioxidants during the [detox process](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8511997/). Antioxidants like [glutathione](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9548276/) and ALA can support the body as it eliminates heavy metals. Lifestyle Modifications In situations where [substance](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK430973/) abuse or lifestyle causes such as excessive [caffeine](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34871964/) are identified as factors in panic attacks, functional practitioners will work with conventional practitioners to seek the most effective ways for people to withdraw from these behaviors and embrace a healthier lifestyle. This could include a combination of a targeted whole foods diet plus CBT, inpatient therapy, partial hospitalization, or other counseling. Complementary and Alternative Medicine for Panic Disorders Below are some of the most beneficial complementary and alternative medicine therapies for reducing panic disorders. HRV Biofeedback Biofeedback is a type of therapy that incorporates measurements of vitals to help people become aware of internalized stress and effective methods for controlling it. During a [biofeedback](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6890254/) session, a client will work with a practitioner to measure heart rate variability, breathing, and sweat rate. They then learn and practice [breathing](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6628946/) and mindfulness techniques that allow them to control their physiology and feel calm on demand. One example of an effective biofeedback [intervention](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8892186/) is resonant frequency (RF) paced breathing. This involves regulating breaths per minute for specified times throughout the day or at the onset of a panic attack to prevent it from escalating. Mindfulness Practices [Yoga](https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2019/0515/p620.html) is effective for reducing anxiety and panic attacks and comes with major health benefits like increased flexibility and improved strength. Acupuncture Some studies show that [acupuncture](https://www.rupahealth.com/post/an-integrative-approach-to-mental-health) can reduce anxiety and improve mood, mediating the impact of panic attacks. It's a safe, [effective](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4104565/) CAM (complementary and alternative medicine) treatment with statistically significant effects.
