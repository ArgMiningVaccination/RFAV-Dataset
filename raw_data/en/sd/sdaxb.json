ORIGINAL ARTICLE Adverse events associated with pediatric complementary and alternative medicine in the Netherlands: a national surveillance study Bj\u00f6rn Vos1&Jan Peter Rake1,2,3&Arine Vlieger4 Received: 27 February 2020 November 2020 /Accepted: 1 December 2020 #The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature 2021 Abstract Pediatric use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in the Netherlands is highly prevalent. The risks ofpediatric CAM use are, however, largely unknown. Therefor e, a 3-year survey was carried out at the Dutch Pediatric Surveillance Unit. Pediatricians were asked to register cas es of adverse events associated with pediatric CAM usage. In 3 years, 32 unique adverse events were registered. Twenty-two of these adverse events were indirect and not related to thespecific CAM therapy but due to delaying, changing, or stopping of regular treatment, a deficient or very restrictive diet or an incorrect diagnosis by a CAM therapist. These events were associated with many different CAM therapies. Nine events were deemed direct adverse events like bodily harm o r toxicity and one-third of them occurred in infants. Only supplements, manual therapies, and (Chinese) herbs were involved in these nine events. In one case, there was a risk of a serious adverse event but harm had not yet occurred. Conclusion : Relatively few cases of adverse events associated with pediatric CAM usage were found, mostly due to delaying or stopping conventional treatment. Nevertheless, parents, pediatricians and CAM providers should be vigilant for both direct and indirect adverse events in children using CAM, especially in infants.

What is New: \u0081In the Netherlands CAM-related adverse events are rare but can occur, with variable etiology and severity (from mild to potentially life-threatening) \u0081Most CAM-related adverse events are not directly the result of CAM toxicities but rather are associated with withdrawal from appropriate therapies or with providers unable to recognize health-relevant states and delaying important diagnoses. Communicated by Gregorio Paolo *Bj\u00f6rn March 2021European Journal of Pediatrics (2021) 180:2165-2171of that country 's own tradition or conventional medicine and are not fully integrated into the dominant healthcare system \" [1]. Pediatric CAM usage is common in the Netherlands: 4.9% of children under age 12 (\u00b1 107.000) and 2.1% of chil- dren between ages 12 and 18 (\u00b1 26.000) visited an alternative therapist in 2017 [ 2]. Numbers about the use of \"over-the- counter \"CAM treatments like supplements or herbs are lack- ing in the general population, but 12% of children visiting apediatrician in the Netherlands are using these kinds of CAMtreatments [ 3]. Higher prevalences have been reported in Dutch children with chronic or life-threatening diseases, who experience side effects from conventional medicine, ordo not respond to regular treatments [ 4-6]. Many parents believe that CAM can support regular treat- ments and is safe to be used together with regular medication[7,8]. However, the safety of pediatric CAM hasn 't been studied extensively and research is often limited to case re-ports. Nationwide surveillance systems among pediatriciansrevealed 8 cases of serious adverse events in Canadian chil- dren in a 2-year period and 39 cases (including 4 deaths) in Australian children in 3 years [ 9,10]. Authors of both studies, however, indicated that they suspected underreporting. Gathering more data on safety, like information on which CAM modalities are associated with higher risks, is important for obvious reasons of legislation and improving the informa- tion given to parents who are considering CAM for their child.The aims of our study were to investigate the type of adverse events associated with CAM in Dutch children visiting a pe- diatrician and to identify CAM therapies or practices associ-ated with a higher risk of adverse events. Materials and methods Population The Dutch Pediatric Surveillance System (DPSS) is an activeonline surveillance system that monitors the prevalence of anumber of predetermined diseases, disorders, or incidents, by sending monthly emails to around 1300 participating Dutch pe- diatricians, requesting them to report on events. Between January2015 and December 2017, a 3-year registration with the DPSS was performed to monitor adverse events related to CAM usage in pediatric patients (age 18 or younger). In 2017, Dutch pedia-tricians treated more than 500,000 children [ 11]. Survey and data analysis As a working definition for CAM, we used a definition that wasused in a similar research by Zorzela et al.[ 9]: CAM is a broad umbrella term for a variety of practices and products that are not considered part of the (Dutch) conventional medicine system, such as chiropractic, massage therapy, and natural healthproducts. Natural health products like herbs, supplements, vita- mins, and minerals can be considered CAM products [ 12]. If they were used to treat clinically relevant deficiencies or are supplemented with proper indication however, they were not considered CAM. A previously used Australian que stionnaire on adverse events related to pediatric CAM usage was translated into Dutch andadapted to the Dutch situation [ 10]. The questionnaire included questions on the age of the child, details on the type of CAM that had been used, the health complaint for which treatment was sought, and the adverse event that occurred. The classification of a treatment as CAM was verified by the authors via the casedescription that was provided by reporting pediatrician. The sub- mitting pediatricians were asked to indicate the likelihood that the adverse event was related to CAM usage (causality), usingthe following values based on the WHO UMC scale: certain, probable, possible, and unassessable. Thereafter, the three au- thors reviewed the cases to see if other potential causes of adverseevent had been excluded. If there were any doubts regarding the causality, the case description, or the adverse event, the reporting pediatrician was contacted by one of the authors. The adverse events were categorized as indirect, direct, or potential based on consensus by the three authors of this arti-cle considering the information provided in the case descrip- tions. For these categories, we used a similar definition as the Canadian study by Zorzela et al. [ 9] but we added a category named \"Potential. \"The definitions of these categories can be found in Table 1. To describe the severity of an adverse event, a scale based on the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) was used since it considers the effect of the adverse event on activities of daily living (ADL) which is an importantmeasure in children. The following scale was used: mild, when the patient had hardly any discomfort and was able to continue daily activities; moderate, when the patient had so much discom-fort that he or she was not able to continue daily activities; severe, when the adverse event impacted daily activities and required treatment; life-threatening, when the patient could have died;and fatal, when the patient died due to the adverse event. Results Reports During the 36-month study period, a total of 32 unique com-plete cases were collected. The children involved in the regis-tered cases were between 10 weeks and 16 years old. Adverse events In 22 cases, the adverse event was indirect due to delay orcessation of a regular diagnosis or treatment (n =1 6 ) ,a2166 Eur J Pediatr (2021) 180:2165-2171deficient or extremely restrictive diet ( n= 4), or an incorrect diagnosis by a CAM therapist ( n= 2). In the 9 cases, the adverse event was directly associated with the specific CAM therapy. One-third of these were infants. In one case, the pe-diatrician had identified a risk of harm, but an actual adverse event had not (yet) occurred. Eight cases were deemed to be mild, 12 moderate, 8 severe, 3 life-threatening, and 1 potentially life-threatening. Five chil-dren were hospitalized, including one child with a 4-week stayat the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit. In 18 cases, the pediatri-cians indicated that the causal relationship between the ad- verse event and the CAM usage was \"certain, \"in 3 cases the relation was \"probable, \"in 9 cases it was \"possible, \"and in 2 case the relation was \"unassessable. \"The details of the cases are shown in Tables 2,3,a n d4 . Therapies involved in adverse events A wide variety of CAM treatments had been used in the reg-istered cases. The most used therapies were dietary supplements/vitamins ( n= 5), orthomolecular therapy ( n= n= 4), followed by naturopathy ( n= 3). Indirect adverse events were associated with many differ- ent CAM modalities (Table 2), whereas direct harm was only seen after use of supplements/vitamins, manual therapies, and (Chinese) herbs (Table 3).

In line with previous surveillance studies in Canada [9]a n dA u s t r a l i a[ 10], we found a wide variety of adverse events, ranging from intoxication and transient hypothy- roidism to multiple organ failure. In most reported cases, the adverse event was caused indirectly by delaying, stop-ping, or changing a conventional diagnosis or treatment, a deficient or very restrictive diet or an incorrect diagnosis by a CAM therapist. The reports of these indirect adverseevents were associated with a myriad of different thera- pies. This seems to suggest that indirect adverse events are a potential risk of any given CAM, unrelated to thetype of treatment. One possible explanation for the occur- rence of these adverse events is insufficient medical knowledge of the involved CAM practitioner to recognizehealth-relevant states, resulting in unsafe practices andadvices. Several of the CAM practitioners, however, werealso a medical doctor, suggesting that lack of medical knowledge is not the only potential factor. Since it is known that important parental reasons for turning toC A Ma r eap r e f e r e n c ef o ra \"more natural \"therapy and fear of side-effects related to conventional medicine [ 3, 4] ,i tm a ya l s ob ep o s s i b l et h a tp arents deliberately chose to ignore conventional treatment advice or even decided to visit a CAM practitioner before seeking conventional medical help. Only a limited number of CAM therapies were involved in direct adverse events. The involved therapies were sup-plements/vitamins, manipulation of the head and neck, and(Chinese) herbs. We found that one-third of the children involved in these adverse events were infants. It is known that supplements, vitamins, and (Chinese) herbs can causeserious harm, especially in (young) children, whose metab- olism and organ function are immature and less tolerant in comparison to adults [ 13-17].

A meta-analysis of adverse events in 2007 described 14 direct adverse events after spinal manipulation, includ ing subarachnoid hemorrhage or paraplegia [18 ]. Stricter regulation on the use of supple- ments, (Chinese) herbs and manipulation therapies, espe-cially in young children, and better training of therapists may be warranted.Our study, as well as other surveillance studies, dem- onstrates the necessity of developing reliable informationfor parents and CAM providers on the safe use of CAM therapies in children. When buying over-the-counter prod- ucts like supplements, vitamins, or (Chinese) herbs, par-ents should be encouraged to discuss this use with their pediatrician or pharmacist. Moreover, both parents and CAM therapists should be made aware that, irrespectiveTable 3 Direct adverse events CAM specifics Adverse event descriptionDiagnosis or indicationAge(years)Severity Relation between CAM andadverseevent Herb of with subluxation manipulation of theneckTransient facial palsy Intestinal cramps0S e v e r e C e r t a i n Supplements and vitamins: apricot kernel supplementsAbdominal complaints,vomiting, sickness due to and vitamins: iodinesupplementsCongenital ofthe newborn due toiodine intoxication of the pregnant motherPrevention of miscarriage0S e v e r e C e r t a i n Supplements and vitamins: vitamin B1 (90 RDA) and B6 supplements (70times RDA) from the InternetNeuropathy and fatigue due tointoxication with vitamin B6Postoperative recovery in child with spina bifida16 Moderate Certain Supplements and vitamins: vitamin B1and B6 supplementsToxic of vitamin B6 withthe of syndrome4 Severe Probable Supplements and vitamins: vitamin B6 supplementsChronic fatigue due to intoxicationwith vitamin B6Down syndrome12 Moderate RDA recommended dietary allowance2169 Eur J Pediatr (2021) 180:2165-2171of the used CAM therapy, they should never delay, stop, or change a regular treatment without consulting a physi-cian. Pediatricians should become aware that using a CAM therapy can lead to stopping or changing of a reg- ular treatment. The identifica tion of this potentially dan- gerous effect of CAM therapies is often obscured by the scarce communication about CAM between doctors and parents [ 3,5,8]. Therefore, physicians should actively discuss CAM usage on a regular basis. Since the adverse events were extremely diverse, both in CAM modalities and in type of events, it is not possible toadvice against certain CAM therapies. Only in the case of supplements, vitamins, head/neck manipulation, and (Chinese) herbs, we found therapy-specific adverse events. The low frequency of the reported events is, obviously, not enough to ban these practices in children, but increased aware-ness among CAM users, health professionals (including CAM providers), and health inspectorates regarding the risks of these CAM modalities seems required. Continuing surveil-lance for adverse events related to CAM use (similar to the surveillance of regular medicine usage), preferably world- wide, is necessary to increase knowledge on the safety of theseand other CAM therapies. We found 32 unique valid cases in 36 months. When ad- justed for population size differences, this result is comparableto an earlier Australian study by Lim et al. [ 10]i nw h i c h3 9 confirmed cases were reported over a similar period of 3 years.As in the Australian study, we suspect underreporting of ad-verse effects in our study, since 50% of the cases were regis- tered in the last 3 months when we actively created more attention for this study. Moreover, it is reasonable to assumethat milder cases of CAM-related adverse events are only seen by the children themselves, their parents, or general practi- tioners, who are not included in the Dutch pediatric surveil-lance system. It is therefore impossible to make reliable esti- mations on the true prevalence of CAM-related adverse events. Another limitation of these types of studies is the factthat associations between CAM use and adverse events cannotalways be made with certainty. We mostly relied on reportsfrom the reporting pediatricians to assess causality, and noformal or structured assessment tool was used. In conclusion, this nationwide surveillance study shows that, given the high percentage of Dutch children usingCAM, relatively few cases of adverse events due to pediatric CAM were found, but there were indications of underreporting. Parents, physicians, and CAM providersshould be encouraged to be vigilant for direct and indirect adverse events whenever CAM therapies are used, especially in young infants.
