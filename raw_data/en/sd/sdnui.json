Which pots & pans are the least toxic?", "sitename": "Lead Safe Mama, LLC", "date": "2021-01-28", "cleaned_text": "For those new to this website: Tamara Rubin is a multiple-Federal-award-winning independent advocate for childhood Lead-poisoning prevention and consumer goods safety, and a documentary filmmaker. She is also a mother of Lead-poisoned children (two of her sons were acutely Lead-poisoned in 2005). Since 2009, Tamara has been using XRF technology (a scientific method used by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission) to test consumer goods for toxicants (specifically heavy metals \u2014 including Lead, Cadmium, Mercury, Antimony, and Arsenic). All test results reported on this website are science-based, accurate, and replicable. Items are tested multiple times to confirm the test results for each component tested. [Tamara's work was featured in Consumer Reports Magazine in February of 2023 (March 2023 print edition).](https://www.consumerreports.org/toxic-chemicals-substances/the-power-of-citizen-science-a1450367401/) I get some version of this question every. single. day! \"Which are the least-toxic pots & pans?\" \"Which pots & pans are the best?\" \"Which pots and pans do you use in your home?\" \"What's the best brand for nontoxic pots and pans?\" First: What to AVOID when purchasing cookware Given my area of expertise \u2014 based on more than a decade of using X-Ray Fluorescence analysis to quantifiably detect and report on metallic toxicants in consumer goods \u2014 I am more comfortable advising people on what NOT to buy (e.g. specific items that I have personally tested and found to contain high levels of Lead, and/or Cadmium, Arsenic, or other heavy metals), so I am going to start off with that! Continue reading below the list for what I recommend buying, BUT please DO NOT skip reading this section! - I avoid any and all non-stick coatings \u2014 this includes the latest \"breakthrough-completely-nontoxic-titanium-based-diamond-finish-nano-ceramic-matrix-blah-blah-blah\" (fill-in-the-\"miracle\" coating-of-the-month) hyped-up coatings found on so many brands and styles of cookware today! [Check out this link for more on that.](https://tamararubin.com/2020/12/lead-free-toxic-metals-free-always-pan-tests-positive-for-lead-chromium-titanium-cobalt-more-14-metals-using-xrf-technology/) - I avoid any and all glazed ceramic pans. This includes blatantly misleading and dishonest claims \u2014 brands or models of pans that are actually glazed, yet insist (via their marketing materials) that somehow they are not glazed (Xtrema, Ceramcor, Mercola, etc.)! [Breaking one of these pans in half](https://tamararubin.com/2019/05/xtrema-cookware-an-important-point-the-clay-substrate-was-positive-for-only-4-metals-this-means-the-other-metals-found-are-all-in-the-glaze/)quickly reveals that the interior ceramic substrate is finished with a clearly distinct, separate glazed coating on the surface; elemental analysis easily reveals the utter fraudulence/absurdity of many of these so-called \"metals-free\" pans (as well as the specific levels of each of the many metals found in their various substrates and coatings!) [Check out the link here.](https://tamararubin.com/2017/06/mercola_pan/) - I avoid any and all enamel-coated metal pots and pans. This includes [Le Creuset,](https://tamararubin.com/2019/02/made-in-france-c-2013-yellow-le-creuset-enameled-sauce-pan-15800-ppm-cadmium-a-known-carcinogen/) [Staub,](https://tamararubin.com/2017/12/staub/) [Lodge](https://tamararubin.com/2019/01/light-blue-white-lodge-cast-iron-enameled-dutch-oven-48-ppm-lead-35-ppm-arsenic/)... pans from ANY BRAND that have an enamel coating over metal. There ARE some brands that make products in this range offering some Lead-free options (and Cadmium-free options), but we have learned we cannot count on these brands to be consistently accountable \u2014 with best-practices testing, and continuous monitoring of their manufacturing and supply chains. This includes lifetime implications for all the ingredients in their coatings ... so it is best to avoid them altogether. [Check out the link here](https://tamararubin.com/2019/02/made-in-france-c-2013-yellow-le-creuset-enameled-sauce-pan-15800-ppm-cadmium-a-known-carcinogen/). - I avoid any and all tinted glass for cooking! [In exception, I use some known-to-be-toxicant-free tinted glass for glassware.](https://tamararubin.com/2018/01/newer-made-in-france-duralex-marine-blue-tumbler-lead-free-these-are-the-drinking-glasses-we-use-in-our-home/)However, most tints are made with heavy-metals-based colorants \u2014 and there is really no legitimate reason for this class of toxic colorants to be in our cookware! Why do we even need \"fashion tints\" in our food-use glass? No thank you! [Check out the link here.](https://tamararubin.com/2018/09/asktamara-do-you-recommend-corning-visionware/) - With very few exceptions, I avoid any and all cookware with silicone. I know \u2014 it's the latest hugely-popular \"miracle 'un-plastic'\" \u2014 but I have found enough examples of modern silicone products (including cookware) to test positive for trace levels of [Cadmium,](https://tamararubin.com/2020/03/oxo-green-silicone-spatula-1117-ppm-lead-11-ppm-cadmium-in-the-food-contact-surface-i-avoid-this-brand/)and some even have unsafe levels of LEAD! Given this, I feel it is really not worth the risk. [Check out the link here](https://tamararubin.com/2019/04/whats-wrong-with-you-kitchenaid-kitchenaid-c-2010-yellow-silicone-spatula-970-29-ppm-lead-90-ppm-is-unsafe/). - I avoid any and all cookware with BRASS \"accents\" (functional or decorative elements). Most often I am seeing this in decorative knobs or functional handles on pots and pans. Almost always, these elements are made of high-Lead-content brass (in the 30,000 to 40,000 ppm range). [Check out the link here](https://tamararubin.com/2018/04/a-new-trend-in-stupidity-expensive-fancy-cookware-with-leaded-brass-handles-is-all-the-rage-in-kitchen-fashion/). - I avoid any and all cookware that has painted elements of any kind! This includes painted logo markings (whether these are on glass or metal kitchen items), painted measurement markings (on glass or metal), etc. Many manufacturers applying these painted markings on glass and metal food and beverage containers are often \u2014 mind-bogglingly \u2014 still using actual Lead Paint! [Check out the link here.](https://tamararubin.com/2019/12/purple-pyrex-glass-measuring-cup-20700-ppm-lead-90-is-unsafe-175-ppm-cadmium-yum-what-are-you-baking-with/) - Similarly, while I LOVE [plain undecorated wooden cooking utensils and bowls](https://tamararubin.com/2019/12/a-lovely-inexpensive-natural-non-toxic-gift-idea-olive-wood-bowl-from-trader-joes-lead-free-only-5-99/)\u2014 I avoid any and all wooden cooking utensils and other wooden cookware components if they have ANY painted or decorative markings! [Check out the link here](https://tamararubin.com/2018/07/russian-1985-khokhloma-wooden-decorated-spoon/). - As a rule of thumb, [I steer clear of any](https://tamararubin.com/2019/12/vintage-pyrex-spring-blossom-green-crazy-daisy-mixing-bowls-109900-ppm-lead/)vintage cookware of any kind. In most cases \u2014 depending on when the items were made \u2014 safety standards were either non-existent or much laxer than current standards. Bear in mind, most experts who study the health impacts of heavy metals consider even today's safety standards (across industries) to still be inadequate!

[Check out the link here.](https://tamararubin.com/2017/01/kitchenaid-attachments-c-2014-as-high-as-2434-ppm-lead/) - I also avoid any branded products Marke](https://tamararubin.com/2019/11/2019-cost-plus-world-market-here-comes-santa-claus-christmas-dish-1705-ppm-lead-90-up-is-unsafe-for-kids/) [t](https://tamararubin.com/2019/11/2019-cost-plus-world-market-here-comes-santa-claus-christmas-dish-1705-ppm-lead-90-up-is-unsafe-for-kids/)(among others) \u2014 these particular brands have demonstrated a flagrant lack of responsibility through a history of knowingly selling Leaded products. [Check out the link here.](https://tamararubin.com/2020/02/list-of-stores-i-wont-shop-at-because-they-sold-things-with-lead-or-still-sell-things-with-lead/) - I avoid any and all Aluminum cookware or utensils (including the [Always Pan,](https://tamararubin.com/2020/12/lead-free-toxic-metals-free-always-pan-tests-positive-for-lead-chromium-titanium-cobalt-more-14-metals-using-xrf-technology/) [Green Pan](https://tamararubin.com/2021/01/green-pan-lead-free-although-i-dont-recommend-it-aluminum-substrate-tests-positive-for-trace-levels-of-antimony/)products, and similar). This includes bare Aluminum, coated cast Aluminum, un-coated cast Aluminum, etc. Nearly all of the Aluminum cookware I have tested has been contaminated with unsafe levels of Lead. Examples of cast Aluminum cookware include many [garlic presses,](https://tamararubin.com/2018/12/bare-metal-garlic-press-2685-ppm-lead-33-ppm-cadmium-is-it-a-problem-that-my-garlic-press-is-positive-for-lead/) and uncoated).

This includes cookware, strainers, food storage, pitchers, cups, [etc.](https://tamararubin.com/2019/12/nlr-please-dont-ever-buy-peanut-butter-packaged-in-plastic-jars/) Note/Warning: If an environmentally-focused blogger tells you a new-fangled set of pots and pans is \"safe and truly non-toxic\" ... don't simply believe them. Did they do their homework? What are they basing their claims on? Usually, it's just the marketing materials of the manufacturer! How much of a commission are they making from this recommendation? DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE! If it SOUNDS too good to be true ... it probably ISN'T TRUE! Three examples: [Ceramcor/Xtrema](https://tamararubin.com/2018/08/july-2018-ceramcor-xtrema-saucepan-update/), [Always [Green Pan.](https://tamararubin.com/2021/01/green-pan-lead-free-although-i-dont-recommend-it-aluminum-substrate-tests-positive-for-trace-levels-of-antimony/) So Tamara, what DO you buy? What do you use in YOUR kitchen? What DO you recommend? Everything I personally use or recommend usually falls within the following categories \u2014 with very few exceptions. This list includes many materials your grandmother (or great-grandmother) might have used in her kitchen at the turn of the previous century \u2014 before the mass manufacturing of consumer goods took over our world \u2014 which, as it turns out, is a great place to start! - Plain undecorated [clear glass](https://tamararubin.com/2016/12/some-good-lead-free-mixing-bowls-choices/)with no painted markings. - Plain undecorated [cast iron](https://tamararubin.com/2019/05/stargazer-made-in-usa-pre-seasoned-cast-iron-lead-free-cadmium-free-mercury-free-and-arsenic-free-too/)with no painted markings and no additional metal accents. - Plain undecorated (locally [stainless steel](https://tamararubin.com/2021/01/i-bought-a-set-of-three-of-these-stainless-baking-sheets-for-my-sons-college-apartment-he-loves-them/)with no painted markings and no additional metal accents, specifically low-nickel stainless for those who have concerns about nickel allergies. That's it! Easy Peasy! Pro-tip: Mix it up! The trick in following the above guidelines is \"keep it mixed up.\" Follow the above guidelines but don't rely too much on any one type of pan or dish. Use a little of this and a little of that for each meal (or for each day of cooking). Don't use a single pan for everything, especially if you have concerns about limiting your exposure to things like Iron, cast iron, Nickel, or other components of stainless steel). By using an assortment of materials to cook with (simple materials without Lead, Cadmium, Mercury, Arsenic, and Antimony), you are much less likely to suffer any potential negative impact that might otherwise be caused by regular daily usage of only one single material. For example, potential impacts if you ONLY used stainless pans or ONLY used cast iron with daily cooking, especially of highly acidic foods. That said, even with our family's regular frequent use of cast iron, one of our kiddos is still low in iron. [So while hemochromatosis (essentially iron poisoning in humans who cannot eliminate iron properly) is a real thing](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/what-is-hemochromatosis#1) \u2014 I don't think cast iron usage (with a well-seasoned cast iron pan) is automatically a concern for folks in the general population who do not have that diagnosis (although of course check with your doctor on that one)! You can use these guidelines now to go out and buy ANY cookware that fits within these guidelines and you should be good! You don't NEED specific brand or model recommendations from me, I promise! \"But TAMARA! I want you to tell me WHAT TO BUY! I want to know EXACTLY WHAT TO BUY!\" Well \u2014 this is the part of my work that I absolutely hate! I cannot recommend things in a vacuum, without knowing regular intended use, usage habits, usage conditions, etc. I also HATE recommending products from specific brands \u2014 for while I might write a post showing one month that a recently manufactured example was free of toxic heavy metals, they could change their production methodology or materials sourcing the next month, possibly manufacturing a version of the same pan that is not 100% Heavy Metals free. The best example I have seen of this is manufacturers adding a painted logo to a glass lid, where there previously wasn't one. So the link that I initially share (because a recent version of that product seemed to be a good choice) might later, at some unspecified time in the future, link to a newer version of the product that may have changed in some way and now has a component that I wouldn't recommend. For example, I might recommend a product based on the fact that the one pictured/one I had actually tested appears to have etched measurement markings \u2014 but then you order it and the one you receive appears to have painted measurement markings instead! So, with the Caveat that I cannot change what companies may do in the future \u2014 below are TWO SECTIONS of links with recommended products here on the site (and if you continue to read this post, I will link some specific products directly with their vendors or with Amazon in the next section). Section 1: Best places here on the blog to look for non-toxic options (including many specific linked choices), as well as where to read more about them and my recommendations.

There is a broader selection of items in the Amazon Store (more generally, items that have tested or are likely to test negative for Lead) and I try to add to that with new finds every month in one or more categories.
