Follow Seema Yasmin on Twitter at [@DoctorYasmin](https://twitter.com/DoctorYasmin) QUESTION 1 OF 6 How is Ebola spread from person to person? The virus is spread through direct contact with infected bodily fluids such as blood, saliva, urine, vomit and feces. The virus travels through cuts in the skin or across mucous membranes (including gums and eyes). Ebola isn't spread through the air or through water. Health care workers are at risk of infection if they get stuck with a contaminated needle. People who bury Ebola victims without wearing protective equipment are also at risk of infection. QUESTION 2 OF 6 What are the symptoms of Ebola? Ebola can cause fever, headache, diarrhea, vomiting, muscle aches and rash two to 21 days after infection. These symptoms closely mirror symptoms of other diseases such as malaria and typhoid, so it's important to see your doctor if you have recently traveled to West Africa and return home with these symptoms. QUESTION 3 OF 6 Am I at risk of infection if an Ebola patient sits next to me in a hospital waiting room? The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the risk is low because Ebola is not spread through the air. If an Ebola patient were to bleed on you, the virus would have to travel through cuts in the skin or across mucous membranes to cause infection. QUESTION 4 OF 6 Then why is it spreading so quickly through West Africa? Because the health care system there is not equipped to deal with the infection. There are not enough doctors and nurses and the basic equipment needed to protect people - things like gloves and masks - are unavailable. There's also a long-standing issue of mistrust between citizens and the government, which is stopping some people from seeking care and isolation. QUESTION 5 OF 6 Are most U.S. hospitals equipped to isolate and treat Ebola patients or should they only be treated at special facilities? U.S. hospitals have the facilities, protocols and equipment to properly isolate Ebola patients. Extra precautions are taken to protect health care workers from the virus. Facilities with suspected Ebola patients work closely with their local and state health departments and with the CDC. QUESTION 6 OF 6 Is there a treatment for Ebola? How would doctors treat Ebola patients in U.S. hospitals? There is no specific treatment for Ebola. Patients are treated with intravenous fluids, medications to reduce fever and dialysis if their kidneys are affected. There are experimental treatments that have been given to a few patients. They include ZMapp, TMK-Ebola, AVI-7537 and blood transfusions from Ebola survivors. None of these treatments have been proven to work, and it's not known if they affected the outcomes of the patients that received them. Clinical trials of Ebola vaccines are taking place. Results are expected in the next few months, but even if the treatments are successful, they may not be available right away. QUESTION 7 OF 7 What about international flights? Nope. The 2006 change said that airlines cannot operate nonstop international flights into or out of ebola Field.
