[ 4 ]Medical Students Support the Use of Alternative Therapies The findings of a new study published January 20, 2010, in the online issue of Evidence-based Com - plementary and Alternative Medicine found that three- quarters of medical students asked felt that conven - tional, Western medicine would benefit from integrating more CAM therapies and ideas. This study is reportedly the largest national survey of its kind. Researchers from UCLA and UC San Di - ego, including experts in the fields of CAM, integrative medicine, Western medicine, medical education, and survey development, assessed their results based on 1,770 surveys. Though researchers found that medical students supported the importance of CAM and alternative med - icine, some obstacles that could prevent future doctors from recommending these treatments were also identi - fied. According to the findings (as reported on escien - cenews): 77 percent of participants agreed to some extent that patients whose doctors know about complementa - ry and alternative medicine in addition to conventional medicine, benefit more than those whose doctors are only familiar with Western medicine. 74 percent of participants agreed to some extent that a system of medicine that integrates therapies of conventional and complementary and alternative medi - cine would be more effective than either type of medi - cine provided independently. 84 percent of participants agreed to some extent that the field contains beliefs, ideas, and therapies from which conventional medicine could benefit. 49 percent of participating medical students indi - cated that they have used complementary and alterna - tive treatments however few would recommend or use these treatments in their practice until more scientific assessment has occurred.

Hudson, which appeared in the December 2009/ January 2010 edition of Integrative Med. As Henson writes, \" About two-thirds of women develop symptoms of menopausehot flashes, night sweats, anxiety, sleep disruption, body aches, fatigue, mood changes, or others. Botanical alternatives to risk-associated hormone re - placement therapy (HRT) are gaining interest among these women.\" Black cohosh ( Actaea racemosa ) is examined in depth, the results of which Henson reports that \"despite the mixed results of studies of black cohosh, [Hudson] says, \"the collective findings and empirical clinical evidence suggest that it may be effective in some women for menopausal symptoms of hot flashes (day or nighttime), mood swings, sleep disor - ders, and body aches.\" The most used dosage is 40 to 80 mg daily of standardized extract.\" Additional herbs discussed include chaste tree berry ). visit: http://cms.herbalgram.org/herbclip/393/review011031-393.htm Black cohosh, Actaea racemosa[ 6 ] [ ]Lemon balm, Melissa officinalis ACHS Student Work A Shaman's Journey by Lyla Carder, Diploma in Holistic Health Practice My journey started when I was a child of eight years and started learning the ways of the Grandfathers' from my Native American Elders. I spent a total of eleven years listening, learning, and filing away information. Then modern life stepped in and I was caught up with the process of just living for many years. About five years ago, I re-evaluated the direction my life had taken, and decided to return to the teachings of the Elders. At that point I determined that I needed to write down what I had been taught about spiritual beliefs and natural healing ways. I wanted to preserve it and share it with others, so I decided to write a book. I also decided to pursue more learning in alternative healing practices to enhance and complement my shamanic teachings. I chose ACHS as the school that offered the best online program for that enhancement. Two years ago, at the encouragement of my husband, I stepped out of the working environment and into full-time devotion of writing and being a student. In July of 2009 I had the opportunity to attend a writers' workshop sponsored by Hay House Publishers. As part of the workshop they offered a contest; they would choose one participant's book proposal and publish that book. So I submitted my book idea for the first time. I was not selected as the winner of the contest. I am grateful for the experience of submitting my proposal. I have had a fantastic learning experience and have received encouragement and confidence to move forward. The right publisher for my book will appear someday when the time is right. As I start rewrites on my book and continue to pursue a writing career, I am also nearing the end of my classes with ACHS. I am excited about getting my own practice started using my shamanic teachings with my holistic health modalities to help others heal themselves. I perceive the different branches and forks in my life journey to be coming together and forming a clearly defined road for me to walk upon. The main focus of a shaman is to educate and teach others how to live a better life. The main focus of holistic health is to educate and teach others how to maintain or recover balanced health naturally, so that they can live a better life. I think I have found a perfect match.

Watercress is a semi-aquatic hardy peren - nial that grows in flowing water (even in cold winter months) in Europe, North America, and SW Asia[1,2]. Watercress is a member of the Cruciferae family and is thus considered a cruciferous vegetable (along with broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, and others) and shares many of the health properties attributed to this group of vegetables. Watercress prefers alkaline water sources, such as creeks flowing by chalk and limestone deposits, which are rich in minerals. The nutritional profile of watercress depends on the water in which it is grown. Foraging for your own watercress can yield more peppery, crunchy, and nutritious water - cress, but beware of parasites. The common liver fluke ( Fasciola hepatica ) tends to reside on watercress found in creeks near livestock, farms, and urban areas[1,2]. Clean mountain springs tend to be a good source. Always wash watercress well and if foraged from a questionable area, eat only after boiled for a few minutes[2]. Watercress is considered a \"superior\" food, possessing a number of nutritive and medici - nal components. Nutritionally, watercress is a rich source of vitamins A and C, calcium, iron, iodine, manganese, phosphorus, and trace minerals[1,3]. Watercress is also a good source of magnesium, vitamin E, folate, and a number of other B vitamins[3,4]. A serving of a few cups contains over 3,000 IU of vitamin A, approximately 50 mg of vitamin C, 120 mg of calcium, 0.2mg of iron, 0.2mg of manga - nese, and 60 mg of phosphorus[4]. (Nutrition - al analyses were not available for iodine and the trace minerals from the cited source.) In addition to watercress' nutritional prop - erties, this plant has a long history of use in detoxification. Watercress regulates metabolic processes, cleanses toxins, tonifies and builds the blood and harmonizes the body's fluid bal - ance (removing mucous accumulation in the lymphatic and digestive system, promoting urination, and softening hard deposits found in the body (urinary stones, gallstones))[3]. Taken internally and used externally as a juice, it is helpful in clearing eczema and blemishes[5]. Paracelsus said that watercress in the body, as in nature itself, draws all toxins to itself and transforms them[2]. Recent research supports Paracelsus' observations: A study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition in February 2007 found that regular watercress consumption was associated with a reduced risk of cancer[6]. The study was conducted in 60 individuals, half of whom were non- smokers and half of whom were smokers. All subjects were healthy at the beginning of the trial and were not taking any supplements or medications. Study participants in the treat - ment phase consumed 85g/d ( approximately 2 \u00bd cups raw) of fresh watercress purchased from a local store as part of their diet for an eight-week period. The control group did not consume any watercress over the eight-week period. Concentrations of plasma -carotene and lutein (antioxidants that prevent against damage to the DNA of lymphocytes) rose sub - stantially following watercress consumption6. The study concluded that regular consump - tion of watercress is linked to a decreased risk of cancer via reduced damage to DNA and improved antioxidant status. Watercress can be found in many grocery stores or perhaps in your local stream? It can be juiced, prepared as an herb tea, eaten raw in salads or sandwiches, stir-fried, steamed or cooked in soups. In salads, it pairs nicely with sliced radish, grated carrot, fresh ginger and cucumber. Dressed with sesame oil, rice vinegar and black sesame seeds, it is an aes - thetic and nutritional delight!

Blending smell with touch massage, then, can create a very romantic and intimate and touch is a powerful mood enhancer. This Valentine's Day, celebrate your vitality and create romance with sensuous essential oils. Scent has always excited the strongest emotions in man. Cleopatra wooed Mark Antony with jasmine scent, and to this day, in India, a paste is made from the flowers for use as an aphrodisiac. Similarly, rose oil has a very rich romantic history. Sappho, the Greek poet, called it the \"Queen of Flowers,\" and Cupid is rumored to have bribed the God of Silence with rose, so that he would not reveal the amorous ways of Venus. Today, the oil of rose (discovered between 1582 and 1612) is used to excite low libido and lends an aphrodisiac-riddled aroma to perfume, bodycare, and massage oils. Like sandalwood essential oil, rose also creates a romantic atmosphere when diffused into the air. Sandalwood, however, is a heavier and woody aroma, and is commonly added to soaps, cosmetics, and aftershave products (which may have a greater appeal to men than a strong floral aroma like rose). Scent is personal, after all. So, incorporate some play into your romantic evening. Explore scent. Find the combination that makes you and your partner feel sensual and vital. In addition to jasmine, rose, and sandalwood, here are some other romantic essential oils to try: black pepper, bergamot, clary sage, neroli, patchouli, and vetiver. To create a sensual atmosphere, you may want to: Create a private space. Fill your space with your favorite colors and fabrics, including pillows and/or blankets. Minimize outside noise. Details: relaxing music, aromatherapy candles, and fresh flowers.

[ 12]\u00a9 2010 American College of Healthcare Sciences Hawthorn ( Crataegus laeviga - ta) is a bush or small tree that includes approximately 280 spe - cies native to northern temperate zones in East Asia, Europe, and eastern North America. The fruit has been used as food and medi - cine in Europe for centuries. Haw - thorn preparations are one of the most popularly prescribed botani - cal medicines in central Europe. Some German clinicians prefer hawthorn to digoxin in mild heart failure. Therapeutic Actions Analgesic, astringent, antibacterial, antihyperlipidemic (lowers serum cholesterol), anti- inflammatory, antioxidant antispasmodic, antiviral, cardiotonic, diuretic, sedative, spasmolytic, and vasodilator Medicinal Uses Hawthorn is used orally for cardiovascular conditions such as congestive heart failure, coronary circulation problems, and arrhythmias. It is also used to increase cardiac output reduced by hypertension or pulmonary disease, to support hypotension and hypertension, atherosclerosis, hyperlipidemia, and Buerger's disease. Hawthorn is also used as a sedative, antispasmodic, astringent, and diuretic, and may be used for gastrointestinal conditions such as indigestion, enteritis, epigastric distension, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Hawthorn fruit may also be effective orally for tapeworm infections, acute bacillary dysentery, and amenorrhea. Topically, hawthorn leaf is used as a poultice for boils, sores, and ulcers. Hawthorn fruit liquid preparations are used as washes for sores, itching, and frostbite. Research has shown benefits with congestive heart failure (CHF). In several studies, taking a specific standardized leaf and flower extract orally appeared to improve ejection fraction, exercise tolerance, and reduce subjective symptoms associated with New York Heart Association stage II heart failure. Maximum effect is usually seen after 6-12 weeks of treatment with 240-600-mg per day of a standardized hawthorn extract1. Dosage and Administration Prepare hawthorn leaf with flower as an infusion: Use \u00bd-cup of boiling water over \u00bd-oz dried herb, steeped for 10-15 minutes. Use 1-T, three to four times daily, during or after meals.
