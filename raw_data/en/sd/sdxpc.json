The purpose of this study was to compare the risk of COVID-19 among those \"up-to-date\" and \"not up-to-date\" on COVID-19 vaccination. Methods Employees of Cleveland Clinic in employment when the COVID-19 bivalent vaccine first became available, and still employed when the XBB lineages became dominant, were included. Cumulative incidence of COVID-19 since the XBB lineages became dominant was compared across the \"up-to-date\" and \"not up-to-date\" states, by treating COVID-19 bivalent vaccination as a time-dependent covariate whose value changed on receipt of the vaccine. Risk of COVID-19 by vaccination status was also compared using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression adjusting for propensity to get tested for COVID-19, age, sex, and phase of most recent prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results COVID-19 occurred in 1475 (3%) of 48 344 employees during the 100-day study period. The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was lower in the \"not up-to-date\" than in the \"up-to-date\" state. On multivariable analysis, not being \"up-to-date\" with COVID-19 vaccination was associated with lower risk of COVID-19 (HR, 0.77; 95% C.I., 0.69-0.86; P -value, <0.001). Results were very similar when those 65 years and older were only considered \"up-to-date\" after receiving 2 doses of the bivalent vaccine. Conclusions Since the XBB lineages became dominant, adults \"not up-to-date\" by the CDC definition have a lower risk of COVID-19 than those \"up-to-date\" on COVID-19 vaccination, bringing into question the value of this risk classification definition. Summary Among 48 344 working-aged Cleveland Clinic employees, those not \"up-to-date\" on COVID-19 vaccination had a lower risk of COVID-19 than those \"up-to-date\". The current CDC definition provides a meaningless classification of risk of COVID-19 in the adult population. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement This study did not receive any funding ### Author Declarations I confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.
