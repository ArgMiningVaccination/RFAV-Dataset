As humans age, vaccinations become less effective. Vaccines are only partially protective or not protective at all in older populations. Preventing or compensating these defects may improve immune responses in the elderly. - [A Study To Evaluate the Effectiveness, Safety, And Tolerability of a Clostridium Difficile Vaccine In Adults 50 Years of Age and Older](/research/clinical-trials/cls-20342282) Rochester, MN The Clover trial is evaluating an investigational vaccine that may help to prevent Clostridium difficile infection. Participants in the study are adults 50 years of age and older, who are at risk of developing Clostridium difficile infection. The study will assess whether the vaccine prevents the disease, and whether it is safe and well tolerated. Each subject will receive 3 doses of Clostridium difficile vaccine or placebo and be followed for up to 3 years after vaccination for potential Clostridium difficile infection. - [Mental Health Screening for Babies. What Can We Learn from Infant and Caregiver Behaviors During Immunization Appointments?](/research/clinical-trials/cls-20408129) Rochester, MN Aim 1. To examine the feasibility of a simple 5 minutes screening procedure that assesses relationship between an infant and their caregiver and the caregiver's capacity to repair and re-regulate the infants' state at 4 and 12 months WBVs (Well-Baby Visits). Aim 2. To develop a brief and easy to implement intervention that could be applied in dyads that show signs of distress at 4 and/or 12 months vaccination appointment and examine the difference in retention rate between patients who were identified at risk at either of the appointments (at 4 or at 12 months) or at both of ... - [A Study Comparing a Vaccine with or without an Autologous Tumor Lysate to Treat Stage III or IV Melanoma to Prevent Recurrence](/research/clinical-trials/cls-20198322) Scottsdale/Phoenix, AZ; Rochester, MN The purpose of this study is to compare a vaccine with autologous tumor lysate loaded into yeast cell wall particles that are naturally and efficiently taken up into a patient's dendrite cells to a placebo without the autologous tumor lysate. The vaccine is formulated to treat stage III or IV resected melanoma to prevent recurrence. - [Viral Therapy in Treating Patients with Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme](/research/clinical-trials/cls-20116731) Rochester, MN RATIONALE: Vaccines made from a gene-modified virus may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of viral therapy in treating patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme. - [The Effect of Certified Child Life Specialist Support on Children's Pain During Immunizations](/research/clinical-trials/cls-20521239) Red Wing, MN The purpose of this study is to provide the first systematic evidence that Certified Child Life Specialists reduce pain during vaccine administration and improve caregiver visit satisfaction in the pediatric primary care setting. A secondary aim will be to record what specific interventions are utilized by the CCLS during vaccine administration and its relation to patient-reported pain and caregiver visit satisfaction. - [Sustained Humoral and Cell-Mediated Immunogenicity of COVID-19 Vaccines in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease](/research/clinical-trials/cls-20542399) Jacksonville, FL The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of systemic immunosuppression on sustained antibody COVID-19 concentrations in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) who received a COVID-19 vaccine. This observational study will collect blood samples to measure sustained antibody concentrations to evaluate seroprevalence and study immunity at 6 and 12 months after completion of vaccination. The primary outcome of this study is to evaluate the immunogenicity of the Covid-19 vaccine in patients with IBD. - [A Study to Evaluate the Spectrum of Healthy Pediatric Inflammatory Responses to Vaccinations](/research/clinical-trials/cls-20456377) Rochester, MN The purpose of this study is to understand the role of systemic inflammation in the genesis of seizures in susceptible children by gaining a clearer understanding of the spectrum of inflammatory responses that occur in healthy children post-vaccinations. - [Immunization Practices in Children with Nephrotic Syndrome](/research/clinical-trials/cls-20305346) Rochester, MN The primary goal of this study is to survey pediatric nephrologists to investigate their immunization practices in children with nephrotic syndrome (NS) and to assess the parental knowledge of immunization recommendations. - [MV-NIS or Investigator's Choice Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Ovarian, Fallopian, or Peritoneal Cancer](/research/clinical-trials/cls-20135757) Rochester, MN; Scottsdale/Phoenix, AZ; Jacksonville, FL randomized phase trial oncolytic measles virus encoding thyroidal sodium iodide symporter (MV-NIS) compared to investigator's choice chemotherapy works in treating patients with ovarian, fallopian, or peritoneal cancer. Measles virus, which has been changed in a certain way, may be able to kill tumor cells without damaging normal cells. - [J&J Vaccine Booster in Transplant Recipients](/research/clinical-trials/cls-20526573) Scottsdale/Phoenix, AZ; Jacksonville, FL; Rochester, MN The purpose of this study is to determine if \"booster\" revaccination with the Janssen Ad26.CoV2.S vaccine (JNJ-78436735, aka the J&J vaccine, a viral vector vaccine) increases anti-COVID spike protein antibody levels in solid organ transplant recipients who did not form acceptable levels of anti-COVID spike protein antibody after receiving two doses of "}
