It also helps to balance not only your energy but your mind, body and spirit connection. The body is mapped out into meridians and with in these meridians are specific points to help heal the body and the organ associated with it. These meridians and points move energy, blood, qi (life force), water and oxygen (through your breath or prana) through them and are interconnected between all levels of the body, including your organs. The energy moves up, down, around the torso, out to limbs, from limbs, to your head and from your head to your torso and to your feet. The human body, in essence, is one interconnected system of pathways, waterways and webs (connective tissue/ fascia) of information.

A meridian or point can be moved with the application of pressure on the point or an acupuncture needle. Stimulation can be provided to the acupuncture point to increase circulation to the area. When the body becomes stuck, we call this a state of Stagnancy. When the body is depleted or deficient in energy, a meridian or points on the meridian could feel empty, hollow or the patient would like you to keep pressing on the point to bring and gather qi, blood and oxygention of blood to the area. The final healing practise of acupuncture is to acquire balance and harmony to the body so the energy, qi and blood move properly.
