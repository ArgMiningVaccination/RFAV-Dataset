Do not make travel plans outside of India If your visa is approved, the consulate will keep your passport while we print the visa. Receiving your passport: A consular officer can make a decision on a visa application only after reviewing the formal application and interviewing the applicant. There is no guarantee that you will receive a visa. Do not sell your house, car or property, resign from your job or make non-refundable flight or other travel arrangements until you have received your immigrant visa. If more information is needed Sometimes a consular officer is unable to make a decision on a visa application because they need to review additional documents or the case requires further administrative processing. When additional documents are requested, the consular officer will give you a refusal letter that asks you to submit additional documents or take certain actions. The letter will include instructions on how to send those documents to the consulate. Administrative processing takes additional time after the interview. Most administrative processing is resolved within 60 days. However, the timing varies based on the circumstances of each case. Before inquiring about the status of administrative processing, please wait at least 60 days after your interview. What happens after visa approval Passport, Visa, and Sealed Immigrant Packet - We will print your immigrant visa on a page in your passport. Please review your visa to make sure there are no spelling errors. USCIS Immigrant Fee - All individuals who are issued immigrant visas overseas must pay an [Immigrant Fee](https://www.uscis.gov/file-online/uscis-immigrant-fee) to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) prior to traveling to the United States. This fee is for processing your residency status and printing your Permanent Resident Card. The only people exempt from paying this fee are: children entering the United States under the Hague Process, returning residents, and people traveling on a K visa. When You Should Travel - You must enter the United States before the expiration date on your visa, which is usually six months from the date of printing. Your visa cannot be extended and all fees are nonrefundable. The principal applicant must enter before or at the same time as other family members with visas. Unless they are eligible for benefits under the Child Status Protection Act, children who are issued a visa before turning 21 years of age must enter the United States before their 21st birthday to avoid losing their immigrant status. Getting a Green Card - Your Form I-551 Permanent Resident Card, also known as a green card, will be automatically mailed to the address in the United States that you write in your visa application form. This is a very important document that proves you have permission to reside in the United States. If you plan to travel outside the U.S. before your green card arrives: Please consult [USCIS's](https://www.uscis.gov/i-9-central/temporary-i-551-stamps-and-mrivs) and [CBP's](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/us-citizens/know-before-you-go/your-trip) websites for rules about what documents you need to re-enter the country. We also recommend you check with the airline to ensure you are in compliance with their rules. Once your card is issued, you should not stay outside of the United States for more than one year. If you do, you will lose your status as a Lawful Permanent Resident. Children's Issues - In the United States, children are required to have certain vaccinations before they can enroll in school. We recommend that you bring your child's complete vaccination records with you to the United States. If your child is adopted, you have full custody because of a divorce, or you share custody with another parent, you should bring a copy of all applicable adoption or custody papers from the authoritative court in your home country. You will need these papers (translated into English) for issues such as school enrollment, medical care, and eventual citizenship. Information for New Immigrants - Please visit the USCIS web page for helpful information on moving to the United States. You can read their publication [\"Welcome to the United States: A Guide for New Immigrants\"](https://www.uscis.gov/citizenship/civic-integration/settling-in-the-us) online. If you are interviewing for a Diversity Visa (DV), all the above instructions apply to you. Please schedule and attend a medical examination prior to your visa interview; enroll in the required courier service; and gather the required documents. Below are additional instructions that apply only to DV applicants. Bring to your interview In addition to the documents listed on the [Pre-Interview Checklist](#pre_interview_checklist) in this package, DV applicants should also bring the following items to your visa interview: Review your DV Lottery entry Prior to your visa interview, we recommend that you review the data on your initial E-DV entry. On your initial E-DV application, you must have correctly entered your marital status. If you are legally married you must have listed your spouse, even if you are currently separated from him/her (unless your spouse is a U.S. citizen or Lawful Permanent Resident). Additionally, you must have listed ALL of your living children who are unmarried and under 21 years old. This includes your natural children, your spouse's children, or children you have formally adopted in accordance with the laws of your country. Failure to have listed an existing spouse or children at the time of your entry in the Diversity Visa lottery will result in the denial of your visa and visas for your family. Any fees paid to the U.S. government in support of your visa application(s) are nonrefundable. If you failed to include a child who had already been born, or a spouse to whom you were married when you entered the lottery, you should not proceed with the visa application. You can review the eligibility requirements [online](/content/travel/en/us-visas/immigrate/diversity-visa-program-entry/diversity-visa-if-you-are-selected/diversity-visa-confirm-your-qualifications.html).
