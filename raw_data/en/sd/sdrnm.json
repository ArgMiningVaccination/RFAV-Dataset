Specific vitamins, nutrients, and herbs may ease symptoms and levels of stress. These include B vitamins, vitamin C, and omega-3s. From boosting immunity and bone health to supporting the nervous system and blood cells, vitamins and minerals are essential in ensuring our physical well-being. But these nutrients are also believed to aid mental health. Stress is one of the biggest mental health challenges in today's world. According to a 2021 survey published by the American Psychological Association (APA), almost [three-quarters](https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/stress/2021/decision-making-october-2021.pdf) of U.S. adults experience stress-related symptoms ranging from headaches to fatigue. One-third even reported feeling so overwhelmed at times that they're unable to make simple decisions, such as what to wear. While vitamins and nutrients may not be able to solve your stress-related difficulties, they could play an important part in helping you [manage stress](https://psychcentral.com/stress/stress-overview), which is crucial for mental well-being and physical health. Something to keep in mind It's generally recommended to get your vitamins and other nutrients through a balanced diet. If you're interested in boosting your intake of specific nutrients through supplements, it's important to speak with a healthcare professional first to discuss the ideal dosage and whether the supplement may interact with any medications you're taking.

A note on price The price range for each product is indicated by dollar signs ($ to $$$). A single dollar sign represents a lower-priced product, while three dollar signs represents a higher price point. However, the prices of supplements vary according to the product size, ingredient quality, and formulation. This means it can be trickier to directly compare the prices of a product. Pricing guide: - $ = under $10 - $$ = $10-$20 - $$$ = over $20 B complex This supplement type comprises eight B vitamins: - B1 - B2 - B3 - B5 - B6 - B7 - B9 - B12 \"Evidence suggests that adequate levels of the entire B vitamin group are essential for optimal physical health and brain functioning,\" explains Jessica DeGore, diabetes care and education specialist at [Dietitian Jess Nutrition LLC](https://www.dietitianjess.com/). \"They play a role in keeping our brains running properly.\" This potentially includes helping to alleviate stress. For example, a [2019 review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6770181/) [2011 study](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hup.1229) B vitamins \u2014 the body's \"stress hormone.\" These vitamins are water-soluble, and the body takes in only the amount it requires. It then excretes unused water-soluble supplements, which is why your urine may have a brighter color when you take them. However, having too high B vitamin intake can lead to severe health issues, including liver and nerve damage, so discussing the best dosage with your doctor is important. [Best B complex supplement for stress: Thorne Stress B-Complex](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0797DVMF3?tag=healthline-subtag-20&ascsubtag=null&correlationId=null) - Price: $$ - How to take it: 1 capsule 1 to 3 times daily - What we like: - It's gluten-free, dairy-free, and soy-free. - Each bottle contains up to 2 months' supply. - It's formulated with extra B5, which supports adrenal function (which helps regulate the body's stress response). - What to look out for: - Vitamin B may disrupt sleep, so consider taking it earlier in the day. - Pregnant people should consult a doctor before taking. - This product shouldn't be taken if you're undergoing cancer therapy. Vitamin C Vitamin C is found in abundance in fruits like oranges and berries. It's important for many aspects of health and, for example, supports: - heart health - immunity - tissues - memory Plus, it's thought to help regulate cortisol, reducing stress levels. \"Adrenal glands react to stress by releasing cortisol. In a stressful situation, these and other hormones trigger the '[ [fight, flight, or freeze](https://psychcentral.com/blog/fight-flight-freeze-stress-response)]' reaction, and vitamin C is rapidly used up,\" shares DeGore. \"The antioxidant properties in vitamin C help cortisol, thus reducing stress.\" [Studies](https://ccforum.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13054-019-2332-x) Researchers have [widely linked](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0955286320304915) vitamin C deficiency to stress-related conditions. Also, [one 2019 study](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/1294/6/062054/pdf) found that taking 500 mg of vitamin C daily 1 week before a public-speaking event reduced feelings of stress.

It's important to check with a doctor before taking it. [can interact](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminC-HealthProfessional/#h20) - This supplement is recommended for adults only. - Vitamin C Omega-3 fatty acids Typically found in fish oil (but also in various plants), omega-3 fatty acids are believed to help with concerns such as: - heart disease - cognitive decline - inflammation - eye degeneration But research also indicates that it may help reduce stress levels. It's largely thought to help by reducing cortisol. [One 2021 study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-021-01077-2) [study from 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306453019303488) in overworked nurses discovered that taking omega-3 helped keep cortisol low, particularly upon waking (the time of day when it's usually highest). The National Institutes of Health (NIH) states that an [adequate intake](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Omega3FattyAcids-HealthProfessional/#h2) Taking too much omega-3s in the form of fish oil may lead to [side effects](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/fish-oil-side-effects) such as: - acid reflux - headaches - diarrhea [insomnia](https://psychcentral.com/disorders/insomnia) For this reason, it's important to discuss the ideal dosage with a doctor.

L-theanine \"L-theanine is found predominantly in green and black teas,\" states DeGore. \"Many studies show that [it] has the potential to promote mental health in the general population by releasing levels of certain chemicals in the brain such as [serotonin](https://psychcentral.com/health/what-is-serotonin) and dopamine, which influence mood, sleep and emotion, and cortisol, which helps the body deal with stress.\" One [2019 review](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11130-019-00771-5) of 9 studies suggests that supplementing with 200 to 400 mg of L-theanine a day may lower stress levels. A [smaller 2019 study](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/11/10/2362/htm) on 30 adults found that taking L-theanine for 4 weeks helped reduce stress-related symptoms. This nutrient may aid in reducing stress because of the relaxation effect on the brain and neurotransmitters, which [researchers state](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213453021001324) may occur as quickly as 30 minutes after ingesting it. Still, there's not enough research to establish a recommended daily dose for L-theanine, so it's best to discuss with a doctor what dosage may be best for you. [Best L-theanine supplement for stress: Sports Research L-theanine 200 mg](https://www.amazon.com/Suntheanine%C2%AE-L-Theanine-Double-Strength-Cold-Pressed-Organic/dp/B00TXY32FY?&linkCode=ll1&tag=psychcentral-vitamins-for-stress-20&linkId=c287df191d1a858286e5b2440527a04c&ref_=as_li_ss_tl&ascsubtag=null&correlationId=null) - Price: $$$ - How to take it: one to two tablets daily with food - Why we like it: - It's formulated with the patented ingredient of Suntheanine, a pure form of L-theanine. - The soft capsule shell can make it easier to take. - It's non-GMO and gluten and soy-free. - What to look out for: - L-theanine may interact with several medications, so it's best to speak with a doctor before taking the supplement. - It should be avoided if you're pregnant or breast- or chestfeeding. - This product is unsuitable for vegetarians or vegans. Magnesium This mineral supports everything from the immune system and nerve function to blood cells and muscle. So, what role does it play in stress? [Researchers](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/12/3672/htm) state that low magnesium levels may make your body more susceptible to stress. Also, a [2018 study](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0208454) This mineral is thought to interact with various stress hormones, helping to regulate the body's response. For example, a smaller 2016 study on 23 individuals found taking magnesium helped lower cortisol and ACTH (the hormone that helps regulate cortisol). The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for magnesium varies by gender and age but is 300 to 400 mg. Too much magnesium can cause side effects such as diarrhea and nausea, so it's important to speak with a health professional if unsure how much to take. [Best magnesium supplement for stress: Nature's Bounty Magnesium 500 mg](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00H5PJ0HW?tag=healthline-subtag-20&ascsubtag=null&correlationId=null) - Price: $ - How to take it: one tablet daily, ideally with food - Why we like it: - A single tablet provides just over the RDA for men and women. - It's non-GMO, free from gluten, wheat, soy, lactose, and milk, and suitable for vegetarians and vegans. - The brand has been producing science-backed supplements for almost 5 decades. - What to look out for: - It shouldn't be taken if you're pregnant or breast- or chestfeeding or have issues with your kidneys. - Magnesium can interact with various medications, including certain antibiotics, so check with a doctor before taking it. Rhodiola rosea Rhodiola rosea is not just nice to look at. This flowering herb has also traditionally been used to ease fatigue and boost brain function. When it comes to reducing stress, [research from 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0944711319304593) suggests that it may help reduce inflammation in the body \u2014 high levels of which can encourage a greater stress response. Plus, review studies from [2018](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13651501.2017.1417442) and [2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0944711316000519) indicate that Rhodiola rosea may impact the body's release of stress hormones and how cells respond to stress. Still, experts agree that more research into the relationship between stress and this herb is needed before definite conclusions can be drawn. There's currently no RDA for Rhodiola rosea. [Studies indicate](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13651501.2017.1417442) that associated side effects \u2014 such as headaches and dizziness \u2014 are relatively uncommon. Still, they may occur, so it's important to speak with a doctor about a suitable dosage. [Best Rhodiola rosea $$$ - How to take it: one capsule, twice a day between meals. - Why we like it: - The brand tests its ingredients to ensure purity and efficacy. - It's suitable for vegans and free from gluten, dairy, and soy. - The capsules are designed for fast dissolution and absorption. - What to look out for: - The product is unsuitable for people with bipolar disorder or those who are pregnant or breast- or chestfeeding. - It is advised to check with a doctor before taking Rhodiola rosea if you're on any medications or have a health condition. Ashwagandha This plant has been relied upon by Ayurvedic practitioners for centuries to boost energy and concentration and help reduce stress. Modern studies have also started to explore its role in minimizing stress. For instance, in a 60-day [study from 2019](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6750292/) [study from 2019](https://www.cureus.com/articles/25730), participants experienced notably lower levels of stress and [anxiety](https://psychcentral.com/anxiety) after taking a daily ashwagandha supplement. Researchers also observed that the participants had reduced cortisol levels. A [2021 review](https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/ben/cn/2021/00000019/00000009/art00008) of human and animal studies showed similar outcomes. There's no official RDA for Ashwagandha. The dosage typically depends on personal circumstances and needs, so it's recommended to speak with a medical professional to determine the correct amount.

[can lead](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK548536/) Specific vitamins, nutrients, and herbs are thought to help reduce stress by influencing stress-related hormones and networks in the body. Cortisol is most reported as the hormone various nutrients interact with. Others, such as B complex, play a role in keeping your brain healthy and functioning overall \u2014 which is vital in maintaining its defenses against stressful situations. The products listed above are only a few if you're looking to help ease your stress levels. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) doesn't regulate dietary supplements in the same way as medications, so it's particularly important to research a product or brand you're choosing. When choosing a supplement, some factors to consider are: - the brand and its reputation - the ingredients and their quality - positive (and negative) user reviews - research to support its use - certifications by external parties [If you'd like to learn more about how to select a high quality supplement, consider reading Healthline's in-depth guide.](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-to-choose-high-quality-vitamins-and-supplements) If taking a supplement doesn't feel like the right option for you, there are plenty of natural alternatives you can try. For example, you may consider: - doing gentle, regular exercise [listening to music](https://psychcentral.com/stress/the-power-of-music-to-reduce-stress) - engaging in [meditation](https://psychcentral.com/health/online-meditation) - trying a new hobby - enjoying some TLC, like a face mask - reading a book - calling a friend [reducing your caffeine and alcohol intake](https://psychcentral.com/stress/stress-relieving-foods) - trying [stress-relieving teas](https://psychcentral.com/health/tea-for-stress) - using [aromatherapy](https://psychcentral.com/health/essential-oils-for-stress) When to see a doctor For those experiencing mild-to-moderate stress levels, taking a supplement or adopting another holistic approach may be enough to help. However, if you find that stress impacts other aspects of your mental well-being, quality of life, or daily activities, consider seeking help from a professional. There's no shame in doing so, and they can help by discussing potential options with you \u2014 such as talk therapy or medication. Can vitamins also be used for anxiety? Although they have similar symptoms, stress and anxiety are two separate concerns. Still, research suggests that some dietary supplements \u2014 including some of those listed in this article \u2014 may also help ease anxiety. [If you'd like to learn more about supplements for anxiety, consider reading our in-depth article.](https://psychcentral.com/health/best-anxiety-supplements) Can vitamins relieve stress over time? How long a vitamin takes to work can vary depending on the product and individual. \"In most cases, vitamin supplementation generally results in rapid resolution of the symptoms of deficiency,\" DeGore adds. \"By taking time-release supplements, stress can be reduced throughout the day.\" A lot of the research into vitamin supplements and stress has been conducted over several weeks and months, which may indicate their effects are enhanced and sustained when taken over an extended duration. How often should I take vitamins for stress relief? It's highly recommended to speak with a medical professional before starting a new dietary supplement \u2014 especially if you take medication, have a known medical condition, or are pregnant or breast- or chestfeeding. Vitamins have long been recognized for maintaining good physical and mental well-being. Taking a daily supplement may help relieve stress \u2014 either on its own or complement other treatments. Some supplements most commonly used to ease stress include vitamins B and C, omega-3s, and magnesium. More research into the relationship between different nutrients and stress is needed, but some evidence may have a positive influence. It's good to remember that the supplemental approach doesn't always suit everyone, and side effects can vary. Plus, dosages and requirements differ by supplement and individual, so it's recommended to seek professional advice before beginning a new routine to help ensure you feel your best. "}
