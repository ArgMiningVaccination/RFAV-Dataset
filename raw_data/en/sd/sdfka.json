A child's body and an adult's body are of course different, as children are not simply 'smaller adults'. Different conditions can affect children, which mean they require a doctor specialising in those particular medical conditions and the anatomy of the child. Paediatricians first qualify as doctors in the UK then go on to specialise in paediatrics. [Paediatricians](https://www.topdoctors.co.uk/doctor/paediatrics/) are able to treat and manage a number of conditions, ranging from minor health problems like a cough or [rash](https://www.topdoctors.co.uk/medical-dictionary/rash), to more serious or long-term conditions, including [congenital defects](https://www.topdoctors.co.uk/medical-dictionary/congenital-malformations), hormonal problems, developmental issues, and mental or behavioural problems. As there are a number of conditions which affect children and which require specialist assessment, paediatricians work closely with doctors in other specialties, and can choose to further specialise in specific sub-specialties of paediatrics. Which sub-specialties are included under paediatrics? Paediatric sub-specialties in the UK include: - Child mental health (assessing and managing mental health difficulties) - Community child health (caring for vulnerable children e.g those with developmental problems, or those who are at risk of facing abuse) - Neonatal medicine (caring for newborns or premature babies) - [Paediatric allergy, immunology and infectious diseases](https://www.topdoctors.co.uk/doctor/paediatric-allergy-immunology/) (infectious and allergic disorders, or problems with the immune system) - Paediatric clinical pharmacology (the development of medicine for children and the use of medicine) - [Paediatric diabetes and endocrinology](https://www.topdoctors.co.uk/doctor/paediatric-endocrinology-diabetes-metabolism/) (hormonal conditions and disorders) - Paediatric emergency medicine (acute healthcare) - [Paediatric gastroenterology](https://www.topdoctors.co.uk/doctor/paediatric-gastroenterology/), hepatology, and nutrition (conditions affecting the gastrointestinal tract and liver) - Paediatric inherited metabolic medicine (inherited disorders affecting the body's reactions) - Paediatric intensive care medicine (treating critically ill children) - Paediatric nephrology (disorders affecting the kidney) - Paediatric neurodisability (acquired long-term conditions, or congenital disabilities) - Paediatric neurology (conditions affecting the nervous system) - Paediatric oncology (cancer) - Paediatric palliative care (life-threatening conditions or life-limiting conditions) - [Paediatric respiratory medicine](https://www.topdoctors.co.uk/doctor/paediatric-respiratory-medicine/) (conditions affecting the respiratory system) - Paediatric rheumatology (inflammatory disorders) Other paediatric areas, such as [paediatric cardiology](https://www.topdoctors.co.uk/doctor/paediatric-cardiology/) and [paediatric surgery](https://www.topdoctors.co.uk/doctor/paediatric-surgery), are specialties within their own right. When should my child see a paediatrician? Your child will see a paediatrician throughout their young life until around the age of 18. If necessary, your paediatrician or GP will refer your child on to a specialist area for their treatment or assessment if it is considered that they need further assessment or more specialised management.
