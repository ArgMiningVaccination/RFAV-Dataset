The Difficult Patient: How Best to Work with Challenging Patients and Their Families Physician Health and Wellness: Advanced Coping Skills Biofeedback and Hypnosis: Fact or Fantasy AAP NCE FUTURE DATES The AAP Pediatrician Life and Career Experiences Study (PLACES) is a research initiative we launched in 2012 to track early career pediatricians' experiences over the course of their careers. This longitudinal study follows 1,800 physicians (both AAP members and non-members) who are in one of two cohorts: a) 2009-2011 Residency Graduates and b) 2002-2004 Residency Graduates. Participants are surveyed twice a year and survey participation rates have been high - nearly 90% responding annually. PLACES is proving invaluable to help us closely understand the perspective and career needs of younger pediatricians and demonstrate our commitment to the future of pediatrics. We are tracking issues such as career paths, personal life changes, hours and compensation, educational debt, career satisfaction, work-life balance, work environment, and daily stressors. Detail is found on our web site: www.aap.org/ placesstudy which includes newsletters, AAP News articles, conference presentations and journal articles. 7 AAP SOIM Newsletter \u00b7 Fall 2017 WELCOME NEW AND REJOINED SOIM MEMBERS Dori Abel Saud Alsahli * Paige Bailey * Kathryn Bakkum * Diane Barsky Taylor Batson * Tiffany Blankenship * Danielle Borin * Lauren Bridges * Leilani Chingcuangco Lingie Chiu Nicole Cooper Ashley Czworniak * Thanh Dai * Kunali Doshi * Callia Elkhal * Rich Elliott Karen English Amanda Evans * Monae Fennell * Hillary Franke Irene Gamra * Sharon Genung * Stephany Giraldo * Rachel Gonnella * Sumandeep Groh Julia Saad Jami * Ann Kalapurakal * Arpanjeet Kaur * Mohammad Khalid * Tiffany Laitano * Jennifer Lawson Matthew LeBaron * Yuan-Chi Lin Linda Linday Maritza Martinez Anna McFarland Petrus-Jones Puzzio * Krist Quinones Lara * * Shuman Shaili Bernadette * Rene Talai * Frances Zappala Melanie Suaris * Cheryl Standing * Denotes Medical Student 8 AAP SOIM Newsletter \u00b7 Fall 2017 AAP ELECTIONS: PLEASE VOTE The AAP president-elect candidates were asked: \" What do you think is the most import ant issue facing pediatricians today? What can the Academy do to help? \" The 2017 national AAP election for president-elect and dist rict officers will begin on Sept. 15 and conclude on October 15. Look for an email message from the AAP election coordinator in September with your personalized link to the ballot. No other login information will be required. Members will be asked to choose their next president-elect: Michael A. Weiss DO, FAAP, or Kyle Yasuda MD, FAAP. The winner will serve as the 2019 AAP president. Kyle Yasuda, M.D., FAAP Seattle, WA Our profession is at risk. We are less satisfied being pediatricians. Compassion fatigue from continuously advocating for children in the challenging health care environment, difficulty accessing subspecialists, inadequate payment for our services, expanded scope of practice by non-pediatricians, the many ex tra hours each day spent on electronic health records all contribute to burnout and put our profession at risk. The cumulative impact of these many stressors is driving pediatrician s' professional satisfaction down. The climate in which we practice is changing, and our reserves are dwindling. The p ediatric glacier that we know and love is melting! Action on any single factor will not halt this process. Our Academy must focus on multiple issues but establish clear priorities. What should come first? On every flight, the flight attendants state that in the ev ent of an emer gency, first put on your own oxygen mask before helping children. I believe that the downward spiral of pediatricians' professional satisfaction constitutes an emergency for the AAP. We pediatricians must have suffici ent oxygen to help others. Our Academy needs to implement the pediatrician resiliency section of the strategic plan now, beginning with an organizational audit to identi fy gaps and strengths. For example, our state and federal government affairs departments' effort to improve access to care and payments for services is a strength. A ga p is the absence of a Medicaid advisory committee to compleme nt the work of the Private Payer Advocacy Advisory Committee. I look forward to participating in developing this support. AAP News election coverage continues in this Voters' Guide and at http://www.aappublications.org/collection/voters-guide and at the AAP Election Center, www.aap.org/election (login required). Michael A. Weiss, D.O., FAAP Coto de Caza, CA To define the single most important issue facing pediatricians today is difficult given the heterogeneity of our physician population. With that said, undoubted ly, the most pressing issue that all pediatricians can unite around is how we can provide the best possible care, with well-documented outcomes, to the largest number of children in the most efficien t way possible. We are, collectively, charged with assuring that all children are appropriately cared for, so the 10,000-pound gorilla challenge is how do we accomplish this in an environment that requires us to spend more and more time on \"non-value added\" tasks that take us away from our patients? The solution to this dilemma resides in conquering our arch nemesis: TIME. How can we find more time to care for our patients? When I last checked, there were still only 24 hours in a day, and most of us require sleep, nutrition and family interaction! To capture this time, we must take a very serious look at how we deliver care. Whether in a primary or specialty practice, large group or solo situation, we all have an opportunity to create efficiencies that will give us more TIME. I believe a major AAP priority should be to help the point-of-care pediatricians achieve these efficiencies through care model redesign education, specific tools, hands-on support and collaboration with colleagues across the country regarding best practi ces. The gift of time allows us to better serve our patients and their families 9 AAP SOIM Newsletter \u00b7 Fall 2017 \"Man's music is seen as a means of restor ing the soul, as well as confused and discordant bodily afflictions, to the harmonic proportions that it shares with the world soul of the cosmos.\" Plato (429-347 BC) Everything in the universe is in a constant state of vibration, including our bodies. Long ago shamans recognized the power of sound when they first used chants and drumming to heal people. In ancient Egypt, Greece, and I ndia, the use of sound and music for healing was a hi ghly developed sacred science. Soni c vibration has been one way of experiencing the energy of the univers e for much of humanity's history. Modern science is now confirming that when the vibrations of our physica l and spiritual bodies are out of harmony it can cause disease. As pediatrician Dr . Nadine Burke Harris says, toxic stress is the kind of stress that can come in res ponse to living for months or year s with childhood tr auma that gets biologically embedded in our bodies (ACES Adverse Childhood Events/Ex periences). Children with adverse childhood experiences and adults who have experienced childhood trauma have higher levels of indicators for inflammation than those who have not suffered childhood trauma. A child's brain and body will produce an overload of stress hormones \u2014 su ch as cortisol and adrenaline \u2014 that harm the function and structure of t he brain. This can be particularly devastating in children, whose brains are developing at a galloping pace from before they are born to age three. As I started to recognize the burden of ACES on my health and my children's health, I turned to chanting as this mindful practice was a doorway to healing for me. From this journey emerged the music I created on my CD 'Wake Up My Divinity' that explores the blending of chants from different faiths, languages and music styles. Through this music, I felt connected to that quiet space inside that I could draw from when I returned to the delightful chaos and confusion t hat is my daily life. And it continues to help me build resilience for myself as a valuable tool for mind body spirit balance. https://anufrench.com/music/ I then started to teach my daughters the beauty of mantra/chanting and began to learn more about sound to ans wer their many questions. In 1967, Dr. Hans Jenny published the first volume of Cymatics: The Study of Wave Phenomena which was a written and photographic documentation of the effects of sound vibrations on fl uids, powders and liquid paste. He concluded, \"This is not an unregulated chaos; it is a dynamic but ordered pattern.\" RESTORING RESILIENCE THROUGH SACRED SOUND By Anu French, MD, SOIM Member Continued on page 10 10 AAP SOIM Newsletter \u00b7 Fall 2017 Pediatric Integrative Medicine Worshop RESTORING RESILIENCE THROUGH SACRED SOUND (Continued) Continued on page 11 What Dr. Jenny was observing was the effect of waves of energy over matter which is now being confirmed by the emerging field of quantum physics. He was particularly impressed by an observation that the vocalization of the mantra Om or Aum in ancient San skrit (regarded by Hindus and Buddhists as the sound of creation), causes a certain energy frequency in the ma tter around it. Ancient healing systems such as Chinese medici ne and Indian Ayurveda, associate specific musical notes with subtle-energy systems of t he body. In yoga for example, particular notes of music correspond to each of the seven chakras or energy centers. In Tibet, priests have long used bells and bowls over and around the body to tune and clear the energy centers. Chimes and tuning forks ar e other tools that have been used to heal not only the body bu t the energy in a room as well. \"Emotional issues that are unresolved block the healing vibrations or cause the disease state to return. When two systems are oscillating at differ ent frequencies, there is an impelling force called resonance that causes the two to transfer energy from one to another. When two similarly tuned systems vibrate at different frequencies, there is another aspect of this energy transfer called entrainment, which causes them to line up and to vibrate at the same frequency.\" (Richard Gordon) Sound healing clears blockages and restores harmony. There has been a growing interest over the past decade into the health benefits of music and sound , examining its psychological and neurological effects. In a systematic review of publications on the psychoneuroimmunology of mu sic, sixty-three studies published over the past 22 years, show a range of their effe cts on neurotransmitters, hormones, cytokines, lymphocytes, vital signs and immunoglobulin s as well as psychological assessments. Sixty-three of these studies show ed that listening to music decreases stress, lowers heart rate and blood pressure, and lowers the levels of the stress hormone cortisol and had a gr eater impact on these things than anti-anxiety medication. Four studies in t he review found that listening to music (drumming, relaxing music, music therapy) resu lted in decreased levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6, a commonly used marker of inflammation. Research so fa r points to the pivotal ro le of stress pathways in linking music to a positive immune response. Recommending sound or music as a mindful practice has become a part of the integrative plan for all my patients and their families. This beautiful website, Vibration for Healing comprises more than 20 vignettes centering on sound healers. It illustrates t he many uses of sound for physical, emotional and spiritual healing from \"singing\" with the dolphins in Hawaii, to meeti ng a \"peace pilgrim\" in Oregon; from a space clearing at a Madison Avenue art gallery to a recital at Santa Fe's famous Loretto Chapel. https://www.gaia.com/video/vibr ation-healing-sound-you-feel 11 AAP SOIM Newsletter \u00b7 Fall 2017 Another resource I love to share with families is the soothing music of Amy Camie, a St Louis based classically tr ained, healing harpist whose melodies have been used in pilot biofeedback studies showing an increase in brain alpha waves which are associated with the self-regulation of stress and a decrease in sympathetic nervous system arousal. Her music can be heard at https://soundcloud.com/amy-camie/tracks The good news is that the brain is plastic, and the body wants to heal. The brain is continually changing in response to the environment. Bu ilding resilience, can help the br ain slowly undo many of the stress- induced changes. There is well documented research on how individuals' brains and bodies become healthier through mindfulness prac tices, exercise, good nutrition, adequate sleep, and healthy social interactions. In St Louis and other cities across the world, there are so many valuable resources and opportunities within the respective communities for coming together to create, share and heal through music and sound. \"Melodic sounds heal our connections with ourselves, each other, and the universal vibration that is our birthright.\" Thalia Stearnes References 1.The psychoneuroimmunological effects of music: A2, Belai A3.
