HOW TO USE THE PLAN Choice of Physicians and Providers PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION SO YOU WILL KNOW FROM WHOM OR WHAT GROUP OF PROVIDERS HEALTH CARE MAY BE OBTAINED. A close physician -to-patient relationship helps to ensure the best medical care. To support effective management of your care, e ach Member is required to select a Primary Care Physician (PCP) at the time of enrollment. A directory of In -Network providers is available online at www.Scri ppsHealthPlan.com . If you need assistance in selecting your PCP, contact our Customer Service Department toll free at 1- 844-337-3700 or for the hearing and speech impaired TTY: 1-888-515-4065. You may also request a printed version of the Provider Directory by contacting Customer Service or downloading the Provider Directory from our web site www.ScrippsHealthPlan.com . It is your responsibility to access the website or contact Customer Service to verify if the provider is accepting new patients , prior to selecting a PCP . If you do not select a PCP at the time of enrollment, the Plan will designate a PCP for you, and you will be notified of the name of the designated PCP. This designation will remain in effect until you notify the Plan of your selection of a different PCP. A P CP must also be selected for a newborn or an adopted child within 30 days from the date of birth or placement for adoption. You may designate a pediatrician as the PCP for your child. You cannot preselect the newborn's medical group. The PCP selected for the month of birth must be in the same medical group as the mother's PCP when the new born is the natural child of the mother. If the mother of the newborn is not enrolled as a Member or if the child has been placed with the Subscriber for adoption, the PCP selected must be a physician in the same medical group as the Subscriber. If you do not select a PCP within thirty ( 30) days following the birth or adoption, the Plan will designate a PCP from the same medical group as the natural mother of the Subscriber . You can change the child's PCP and medical group. The effective date of your child's new medical group will be the first of the month following discharge from the hospital . If you want to change the PCP for the child after the month of birth or placement for adoption, see the section below on \"Changing PCP or Designated Medical Group. \" If your child is ill during the f irst month of coverage, be sure to read the information about changing PCPs during a course of treatment or hospitalization, under the \"Changing PCPs or Designated Medical Group\" sections. Remember, coverage will cease on the 3 0th day at 11:59pm Pacific Time following the dependent's date of birth or placement for adoption, unless an application for the addition of the dependent is submitted and received by Scripps Health Plan prior to the 30th day. If you have any questions, please contact your Employer . Role of the Medical Group Most Scripps Health Plan PCPs contract with medical groups to share administrative and authorization responsi bilities with them. Your PCP coordinates with your designated medical group to direct all your medical Scripps Health Plan 13 Effective January 1, 202 3 Last Revision: 04/12/2023 Version 21 care needs and refer you to specialists or hospitals within your designa ted medical group unless , because of your health condition, care is unavailable within the medical group. Your designated medical group and Scripps Health Plan ensures that a full panel of specialists is available to provide for your health care needs and help your PCP manage the utilization of your health plan benefits by ensuring that refer rals are directed to providers who are contracted with them. Medical groups also have admitting arrangements with hospitals contract ed with Scripps Health Plan in thei r area and some have special arrangements that designate a specific hospital as \"in -network.\" Your designated medi cal group works with your P CP to authorize services and ensure that service s are performed by their in -network provid er. In some cases, a no n-Scripps Health Plan provider may provide covered services at an in -network facility where we have authorized you to receive care. You are not responsible for any amounts beyond your in-network cost share for the covered services you receive at an in-network facility where we have authorized you to receive care. The name of your PCP and your designated medical group is listed on your Scripps Health Plan member identification card. The Scripps Health Plan Customer Service Department can answer any questio ns you may have about changing the medical group designated for your P CP and whether the change would affect your ability to receive services from a par ticular specialist or hospital. You may call our Customer Care Service Department toll -free at 1- 844-337-3700 with any questions, or for the hearing and speech impaired TTY: 1-888- 515- 4065.

You can al so find a PCP by visiti ng www.ScrippsHealthPlan.com and selecting the Find a Doctor link at the top of the Web page. If you change to a medical group with no affiliation to your PCP, you must select a new PCP affiliated with the new medical group and transition any specialty care you are receiving to specialists affiliated with the new medical group. The change will be effective the first day of the month following notice of approval by Scripps Health Plan . Once your PCP change is effective, all care must be provided or arranged by the new PCP with the except ion of OB/GYN services that are not provided by your PCP. You are not required to obtain a referral or prior authorization for sexual and reproductive health care services, or for OB/GYN services. OB/GYN services must be provided by an obstetri cian/gynecologist or a family practice physician within the same medical group as your PCP. Once your medical group change is effective, all previous authorizations for specialty care or procedures are no longer valid and must be transitioned to specialists affiliated with the new medical group , even if you remain with the same PCP. Voluntary medical group changes are not permitted during the third trimester of pregnancy or while confined to a hospital. The effective date of your new medical group will be the first of the month following discharge from the hospital or when pregnant, following the completion of post -partum care. Additionally, changing your PCP or designated medical group during a course of treatment may interrupt the quality and continuity of your health care. For this reason, the effective date of your new PCP or designated medical group, when requested during a course of treatment, will be the first of the month following the date it is medically appropriate to transfer your care to your new PCP or designated medical group , as determined by the Plan.

Your PCP will request any necessary prior authorization from your medical group or the Plan . The Plan specialist or Plan non- physician health care practitioner will provide a complete report to your PCP so that your medical record is complete. Prior Authorization Some services require approval or prior authorization before you can receive services. Prior authorization requirements for certain services help to assure that you are getting the services you need when you need them.

You will be notified in writing of the determination status of all prior authorization requests. An authorization approval letter will include the name of the provider and the effective dates for the authorization.

Emergency Services What is an Emergency : An emergency means a medical and/or psychiatric screening, examination, and evaluation by a physician, or, to the extent permitted by applicable law, by other appropriate licensed persons under the supervision of a physician, to determine if an emergency medical condition or active labor exists and, if it does, the care, treatment, and surgery, if within the scope of that person's license, necessary to relieve or eliminate the emergency medical condition, within the capability of the facility. \"Emergency medical condition\" means a medical condition manifesting itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity (including severe pain) such that Scripps Health Plan 21 Effective January 1, 202 3 Last Revision: 04/12/2023 Version 21 the absence of immediate me dical attention you could expect to result in (1) placing the patient's health in serious jeopardy; (2) serious impairment to bodily functions; (3) serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part. \"Psychiatric Emergency Medical Condition\" means a mental h ealth disorder manifested by acute symptoms that render a patient (1) an immediate danger to himself, herself or others; or (2) immediately unable to provide for or utilize food, shelter or clothing. Psychiatric emergencies may present independent or conc urrent with a physical emergency medical condition. \"Active labor\" means a labor at a time at which either there is inadequate time to effect safe transfer to another hospital prior to delivery or a transfer may pose a threat to the health and safety of the patient or the unborn child. A patient is \"stabilized\" or \"stabilization\" has occurred when, in the opinion of the treating physician, or other appropriate licensed persons acting within their scope of licensure under the supervision of a treating physician, the patient's medical condition is such that, within reasonable medical probability, no material deterioration of the patient's condition is likely to result from, or occur during, the release or transfer of the patient. What to do in case of Emergency : Members who reasonably believe that they have an emergency medical or mental health condition which requires an emergency response are encouraged to appropriately use the \"911\" emergency response system or go to the nearest hospital emergency room . Life Threatening : Obtain care immediately. Contact your P CP no later than 24 hours after the onset of the emergency, or as soon as it is medically possible fo r the Member to provide notice. Non -Life Threatening : Consult your PCP , anytime day or night, regardless of where you are p rior to receiving medical c are. Post -Stabilization: Once your emergency medical condition has stabilized , your treating health care provider may believe that you require additional medically necessary hospital services prior to your being safely discharged. If the hospital is not part of the plan's contracted network, the hospital will contact your assigned medical group or the plan to obtain timely authorization for these post- stabilization services. If the plan determines that you may be safely transferred to a plan contracted ho spital, and you refuse to consent to the transfer, the hospital must provide you written notice that you will be financially responsible for 100% of the cost for services provided to you once your emergency cond ition is stable. Also, if the hospital is unable to determine your name and contact information of the plan in order to request prior authorization for services once you are stable, it may bill you for such services. Follow -Up Care : Follow -up care, which is any care provided after the initial emergency room visit, must be provided or authorized by your PCP. For a complete description of the Emergency Services benefit and applicable copayments, see the \" Emergency Services \" section within Benefit Descriptions . If you have an emergency medical co ndition and get emergency services from an out- of-network provider or facility, the most they can bill you is your plan's in -network cost -sharing amount (such as copayments, coinsurance, and deductibles). You can't be balance billed for these emergency ser vices. We may attempt to negotiate with the provider or pay an additional amount to resolve the claim. If we pay more, your cost share will not increase. You should ensure the out- of-network provider or facility has a copy of your insurance card prior to d ischarge.

Contact your PCP or your assigned medical group to be directed to the appropriate urgent c are that is within your PCP's medical group. An urgent condition is not an emergency but may require prompt medical attention. If you require urgent care for a condition that could reasonably be treated in your PCP's office or in an urgent care clinic (i.e., care for a condition that is not such that the absence of immediate medical attention could reasonably be expected to result in placing your health in serious jeopardy, serious impairment to bodily functions, or serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part), contact your PCP or your assigned medical group to be directed to the appropriate urgent care that is within your PCP's assigned medical group .

A patient is \"stabilized\" or \"stabilization\" has occurred when, in the opinion of the treating physician, or other appropriate licensed persons acting within their scope of licensure under the supervision of a treating physician, the patient's medical condition is such that, within reasonable medical probability, no material deterioration of the patient's condition is likely to result from, or occur during, the release or transfer of the patient. Members who reasonably believe that they have an emergency medical or mental health condition which requires an emergency response are encouraged to appro priately use the \"911\" emergency response system where available. The Member should notify the P CP or Evernorth BH by phone within 24 hours of the commence ment of the emergency services, or as soon as it is medically possible for the Member to provide notice.

You may also be eligible for an In dependent Medical Review ( IMR). If you are eligible for an IMR, the IMR process will provide an impartial review of medical decisions made by a health plan related to the medical necessity of a proposed service or treatment, coverage decisions for treatments that are experimental or i nvestigational in nature and payment disputes for emergency or urgent medical services.

Individual Continuation of Benefits, COBRA and/or Cal -COBRA COBRA: If a Member is entitled to elect continuation of group coverage under the terms of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) as amended, the following applies: The COBRA group continuation coverage is provided through federal legislation and allows an enrolled active or retired employee or his/her enrolled family member who lose their regular group coverage because of certain \"qualifying events\" to elect continuation for 1 8, 29, or 36 months. An eligible active or retired employee or his/her family member(s) is entitled to elect this coverage provided an election is made within sixty (60) days of notification of eligibility and the required premiums are paid. The benefits of the continuation coverage are identical to the group plan and the cost of coverage shall be 102% of the applicable group premiums rate. No employer contribution is available to cover the premiums. Children born to or placed for adoption with the Membe r during a COBRA continuation period may be added as dependents, provided the employer or COBRA administrator is properly notified of the birth or placement for adoption, and such children are enrolled within thirty ( 30) days of the birt h or placement for adoption. Scripps Health Plan 76 Effective January 1, 202 3 Last Revision: 04/12/2023 Version 21 Two qualifying events allow Members to request the continuation coverage for 18 months : 1. The covered employee's separation from employment (voluntary of involuntary) for reasons other than gross misconduct, 2. Reduction in the covered e mployee's hours to less than half -time. The Member's 18 -month period may also be extended to twenty -nine ( 29) months if the Member or any one of the qualified beneficiaries in your family was disabled and meets certain requirements on or before the date of termination or reduction in hours of employment, or is determined to be disabled under the Social Security Act within the first sixty (60) days of the initial qualifying event and before the end of the 18 -month period (non- disabled eligible family members are also entitled to this 29- month extension). Four qualifying events allow an active or retired employee's enrolled family member(s) to elect the continuation coverage for up to (thirty -six) 36 months. 1. Death of a covered employee, 2. Divorce or legal separa tion of the covered employee or retiree from a spouse, or termination of a domestic partner, 3. A dependent child cea ses to be a dependent child, 4. The primary COBRA Member becomes entitled to Medicare. If elected, COBRA continuation coverage is effective on the date coverage under the group plan terminates. The COBRA continuation coverage will remain in effect for the specified time or until one of the following eve nts terminates the coverage: 1. The termi nation of all employer pro vided group health plans, or 2. The Member fails to pay the required premium(s) on a timely basis, or 3. The Member becomes covered by another health plan without limitations as to preexisting conditions, or 4. The Member becomes eligib le for Medicare benefits, or 5. The first day of the month beginning thirty ( 30) days after the Social Security Administration determines that the individual initially determined to have been disabled is no longer disabled. You will receive notice from your empl oyer of your eligibility for COBRA continuation coverage if your employment is terminated or your hours are reduced. Contact your (former) employing agency directly if you need more information about your eligibility for COBRA group continuation coverage. If the Member is enrolled in COBRA and is contributing to the cost of the coverage, the Employer shall be responsible for collecting and submitting all Premium contributions to Scripps Health Plan in the manner and for the period established under this pl an. Cal-COBRA: COBRA members who became eligible for COBRA coverage on or after January 1, 2003, and who reach the 18 - month or 29- month maximum available under COBRA, may elect to continue medical coverage under Cal- COBRA for a maximum period of thirty -six (36) months from the date the Member's continuation of coverage began under COBRA. Scripps Health Plan of California is responsible for notifying COBRA Members of their right to possibly continue medical coverage under Cal- COBRA , at least ninety ( 90) calendar days before their COBRA coverage will end. If the Member elects to apply for continuation of coverage under Cal -COBRA, the Member must submit the Cal -Scripps Health Plan 77 Effective January 1, 202 3 Last Revision: 04/12/2023 Version 21 COBRA enrollment form to Scripps Health P lan by first -class mail or other reliable means within sixty (60) days of being notified of their right to continue medical coverage under Cal -COBRA. If elected, the Cal -COBRA medical coverage will begin after the COBRA coverage ends. COBRA Member s must exhaust all the COBRA coverage to which they are entitled before they can become eligible to continue coverage under Cal- COBRA. In no event will continuation of group coverage under COBRA, Cal -COBRA or a combination of COBRA and Cal -COBRA be extended for mo re than three ( 3) years or thirty -six (36) months from the date the qualifying event has occurred, which originally entitled the Member to continue group coverage under this Plan. In the event a Member becomes Medicare eligible after enrolling in Cal- COBR A, the Cal -COBRA coverage may be terminated. Monthly rates for Cal- COBRA coverage shall be no more than 110% of the applicable group monthly rates . Rates are subject to change at renewal. Cal-COBRA Members must submit monthly premium payments directly to Scripps Health Plan. The initial monthly premium must be paid within forty -five ( 45) days of the date the Member provided a completed enrollment form to the Plan. Failure to submit the correct amount within the initial forty -five ( 45)-day period will dis qualify the Member from continuation of coverage. Subsequent monthly premium payment s must equal an amount sufficient to pay any required amounts that are due by the first of each month. There is a thirty (30) - day grace period after which time, coverage will be terminated. The COBRA Member should contact Scripps Health Plan for more information about continuing coverage. 8. PAYMENT BY THIRD PARTIES Third Party Recovery Process and the Member's Responsibility If a Member is injured or becomes ill due to the act or omission of another person (a \"third party\"), Scripps Health Plan , or the Member's designated medical group, with respect to services required as a result of that injury, provide the benefits of the P lan and have an equitable right to restitution, reimbursement or other available remedy to recover the amounts Scripps Health Plan paid for services provided to the Member from any recovery (defined below) obtained by or on behalf of the Member, from or on behalf of the third party responsible for the injury or illness or from uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage. This right to restitution, reimbursement or other available remedy is against any recovery the Member receives as a result of the injury or illness, including any amount awarded to or received by way of court judgment, arbitration award, settlement or any other arrangement, from any third party or third party insurer, or from uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage, related to the illness o r injury (the \"recovery\"), without regard to whether the Member has been \"made whole\" by the recovery. The right to restitution, reimbursement or other available remedy is with respect to that portion of the total recovery that is due for the benefits paid in connection with such injury or illness, will be calculated in accordance with California Civil Code Section 3040. The Member Is Required To: Notify Scripps Health Plan or the Member's designated medical group in writing of any actual or potential clai m or legal action which such Member expects to bring or has brought against the third Scripps Health Plan 78 Effective January 1, 202 3 Last Revision: 04/12/2023 Version 21 party arising from the alleged acts or omissions causing the injury or illness, not later than thirty ( 30) days after submitting or filing a claim or legal action against the third party , and Agree to fully cooperate and execute any forms or documents needed to enforce this right to restitution, reimbursement or other available remedies , and Agree in writing to reimburse Scripps Health Plan for benefits paid by Scripps Hea lth Plan from any recovery when the recovery is obtained from or on behalf of the third party or the insurer of the third party, or from uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage , and Provide a lien calculated in accordance with California Civil Code sec tion 3040. The lien may be filed with the third party, the third party's agent or attorney, or the court unless otherwise prohibited by law, and Periodically respond to information requests regarding the claim against the third party and notify Scripps Hea lth Plan and the Member's designated medical group, in writing, within 10 days after any recovery has been obtained. A Me mber's failure to comply with the requirements listed above shall not in any way act as a waiver, release, or relinquishment of the rig hts of Scripps Health Plan or the Member's designated medical group. Further, if the Member receives services from a Plan hospital for such injuries or illness, the hospital has the right to collect from the Member the difference between the amount paid by Scripps Health Plan and the hospital's reasonable and necessary charges for such services when payment or reimbursement is received by the Member for medical expenses. The hospital's right to collect shall be in accordance with California Civil Code Sec tion 3045.1. Workers' Compensation No benefits are provided for or incident to any injury or disease arising out of, or in the course of, any employment for salary, wage or profit if such injury or disease is covered by any workers' compensation law, occupational disease law or similar legislation. However, if Scripps Health Plan provides payment for such services it will be entitled to establish a lien upon such other benefits up to the reasonable cash value of benefits provided by Scripps Health Plan for the treatment of the injury or dis ease as reflected by the providers' usual billed charges. Coordination of Benefits When a person who is covered under this group Plan is also covered under another group plan, or selected group, or blanket disability insurance contract, or any other contractual arrangement or any portion of any such arrangement whereby the members of a group are entitled to payment of or reimbursement for hospital or medical expenses, such person will not be permitted to make a \"profit\" on a disability by collecting benefits in excess of actual value or cost during any calendar year. Instead, payments will be coordinated between the plans in order to provide for \"allowable expenses\" (these are the expenses that are incurred for services and supplies covered under at least one of the plans involved) up to the maximum benefit value or amount payable by each plan separately. If the covered person is also entitled to benefits under any of the conditions as outlined under the Lim itations for Duplicate Coverage provision, benefits received under any such condition will not be coordinated with the benefits of this Plan. The following rules determine the order of benefit payments: When the other plan does not have a coordination of benefits provision, it will always provide its benefits first. Otherwise, the plan covering the member as a Subscriber will provide its benefits before the plan covering the member as a D ependent. Scripps Health Plan 79 Effective January 1, 202 3 Last Revision: 04/12/2023 Version 21 Except for cases of claims for a dependent child whose pare nts are separated or divorced, the plan which covers the dependent child of a person whose date of birth (excluding year of birth) occurs earlier in a calendar year, shall determine its benefits before a plan which covers the dependent child of a person whose date of birth (excluding year of birth) occurs later in a calendar year. If either plan does not have the provisions of this paragraph regarding dependents, which results either in each plan determining its benefits before the other or in each plan de termining its benefits after the other, the provisions of this paragraph shall not apply, and the rule set forth in the plan which does not have the provisions of this paragraph shall dete rmine the order of benefits. 1. In the case of a claim involving expens es for a dependent child whose parents are separated or divorced, plans covering the child as a dependent shall determine their respective benefits in the following order: First, the plan of the parent with custody of the child; then, if that parent has re married, the plan of the stepparent with custody of the child; and finally the plan(s) of the parent(s) without custody of the child, 2. Notwithstanding #1 above, if there is a court decree which otherwise establishes financial responsibility for the medical, dental or other health care expenses of the child, then the plan which covers the child as a dependent of the parent with that financial responsibility shall determine its benefits before any other plan which covers the child as a dependent child, 3. If the above rules do not apply, the plan which has covered the Member for the longer period of time shall determine its be nefits first, provided that: a. A plan covering a Member as a laid -off or retired employee, or as a dependent of such an employee, shall dete rmine its benefits after any other plan covering that person as an employee, other than a laid-off or retired emplo yee, or such dependent, and b. If either plan does not have a provision regarding laid- off or retired employees, which results in each plan dete rmining its benefits after the other, then the provisions of a. above shall not apply. If this Plan is the primary carrier with respect to a covered person, then this Plan will provide its benefits without reduction because of benefits available from any o ther plan. When this Plan is secondary in the order of payments, and Scripps Health Plan is notified that there is a dispute as to which plan is primary, or that the primary plan has not paid within a reasonable period of time, this Plan will provide the b enefits that would be due as if it were the primary plan, provided that the covered person: (1) assigns to Scripps Health Plan the right to receive benefits from the other plan to the extent of the difference between the value of the benefits which Scripps Health Plan actually provides and the value of the benefits that Scripps Health Plan would have been obligated to provide as the secondary plan; (2) agrees to cooperate fully with Scripps Health Plan in obtaining payment of benefits from the other plan; and (3) allows Scripps Health Plan to obtain confirmation from the other plan that the benefits which are claimed have not previously been paid. If payments which should have been made under this Plan in accordance with these provisions have been made by an other Plan, Scripps Health Plan may pay to the other Plan the amount necessary to satisfy the intent of these provisions. This amount shall be considered as benefits paid under this Plan. Scripps Health Plan shall be fully discharged from liability under this Plan to the extent of these payments. If payments have been made by Scripps Health Plan in excess of the maximum amount of payment necessary to satisfy these provisions, Scripps Health Plan shall have the right to recover the excess from any person or other entity to or with respect to whom such payments were made. Scripps Health Plan 80 Effective January 1, 202 3 Last Revision: 04/12/2023 Version 21 Scripps Health Plan may release to or obtain from any organization or person any information, which Scripps Health Plan consider s necessary for the purpose of determining the applicability of and implementing the terms of these provisions or any provisions of similar purpose of any other Plan.
