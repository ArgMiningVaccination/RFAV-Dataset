Testing for bioenergy falls into the holistic health realm and requires a bioresonance test. While this is not a diagnostic tool to be confused with any type of western medicine testing, we are able to test stressed systems of the body. Through this non-invasive testing process, we have the ability to create a detailed report from the energetic resonance that emanates from hair and saliva samples. Armed with the information revealed in these reports, you possess the power to make health changes in a positive direction! When you are ready to take a new approach to understanding your health, bioresonance testing is the option for you, and our holistic health practitioners are available to support you throughout your health journey!
