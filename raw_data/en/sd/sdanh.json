It is inevitable that we could not produce recommendations which would meet all the aspirations expressed to us, while at the same time meeting your requirements for a robust framework for an extension of prescribing which safeguards patient safety . The team believes, however, that its proposals, if implemented, will provide a secure means of increasing the range of health professionals who are authorized to prescribe. This will improve services to patients, make better use of the skills of professional staff and thus make a significant contribution to the modernization of the Health Service. I would like to place on record my grateful thanks to the chairs of the Review Team sub-groups and other Team members, all of whom have given generously of their time and energy to this work while maintaining their busy professional responsibilities. Our discussions have been forthright, in considering the complex issues before us, but have always been constructive and good humoured. The Review Team members join me in expressing our thanks to Donna Sidonio, who led most of the work of the secretariat, and all her colleagues from the Department of Health and the Welsh, Scottish and Northern Ireland Offices. Their knowledge and experience have been invaluable to us in developing our ideas and framing our recommendations. We hope that the recommendations of this Report will enjoy the confidence of Ministers and of professionals and will play a part in further improving health care in this country . Yours sincerely Dr June CrownContents can be prescribed . . . which should not normally be available to new groups Summary of the recommendations from the report on supply and administration under group Current arrangements for the prescription, supply and administration of consultation of Medicines - Final Report 2Summary and Recommendations 1.This report is submitted to ministers by the Review Team for the Prescribing, Supply and Administration of Medicines chaired by Dr June Crown. 2.It sets out a proposed new framework for the prescribing, supply and administration of medicines inside and outside the NHS in which: vthe majority of patients continue to receive medicines on an individual patient-specific basis; vthe current prescribing authority of doctors, dentists and certain nurses (in respect of a limited list of medicines) continues; vnew groups of professionals would be able to apply for authority to prescribe in specific clinical areas, where this would improve patient care and patient safety could be assured. 3.It recommends introducing a distinction between two new categories of prescribers: (i)independent prescribers - professionals who are responsible for the initial assessment of the patient and for devising the broad treatment plan, with the authority to prescribe the medicines required as part of that plan; (ii)dependent prescribers - professionals who are authorised to prescribe certain medicines for patients whose condition has been diagnosed or assessed by an independent prescriber, within an agreed assessment and treatment plan. 4.The report recommends the establishment of an advisory body to assess applications from organisations seeking authority to prescribe on behalf of specified groups of health professionals. It identifies some of the criteria which might be applied and suggests a number of groups which might be early applicants for this assessment. 5.The report also considers the implications of any extension of prescribing authority on arrangements for the supply and administration of medicines, including supply under group protocols which was the subject of our first report. 6.The recommendations are set out in full in the remainder of this summary .They would apply across the United Kingdom and both inside and outside the NHS, although some details of implementation might differ between England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Primary legislation would be needed to implement the key recommendations. S u m m a r y and Recommendations 3Recommendations Recommendations to Health Departments 1.The legal authority in the United Kingdom to prescribe, including authorising NHS expenditure, should be extended beyond currently authorised prescribers . (Para 6.6) 2.Legal authority for new professional groups to prescribe or to authorise NHS expenditure should normally be limited to medicines in specific therapeutic areas related to the particular competence and expertise of the group and may include prescription only medicines within those areas. (Para 6.10) 3.Two types of prescriber should be recognised: ithe independent prescriber who is responsible for the assessment of patients with undiagnosed conditions and for decisions about the clinical management required, including prescribing. At present, doctors, dentists and certain nurses in respect of a limited list of medicines are legally authorised prescribers who fulfil the requirements for independent prescribers and this should continue. Certain other health professionals may also become newly legally authorised independent prescribers, subject to the process described below . iithe dependent prescriber who is responsible for the continuing care of patients who have been clinically assessed by an independent prescriber .This continuing car e may include prescribing, which will usually be informed by clinical guidelines and will be consistent with individual treatment plans; or continuing established treatments by issuing repeat prescriptions, with the authority to adjust the dose or dosage form according to the patients'needs. There should be provision for regularclinical review by the assessing clinician. (Para 6.19) 6.AUK-wide provisionally entitled the \"New Prescribers Advisor y Committee\", should be established under Section 4 of the Medicines Act to assess submissions from professional organisations seeking powers for suitably trained members to become independent or dependent prescribers. (Para 6.27) 10.Newly authorised groups of prescribers should not normally be allowed to prescribe medicines in the following categories: icontrolled drugs (drugs subject to the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971); iiunlicensed drugs, or drugs used outside their licensed indications;Review of Prescribing, Supply & Administration of Medicines - Final Report 4iii\"black triangle\" drugs; ivdrugs over which there is continuing professional concern, eg drugs used to treat children and young people with mental health problems; vdrugs which on public health grounds should be subject to particular safeguards, forinstance antibacterial antibiotics. (Para 6.54) 14.The current arrangements for the administration and self-administration of medicines should continue to apply. Newly authorised prescribers should have the power to administer those parenteral prescription only medicines which they are authorised to prescribe, and to issue directions for the parenteral administration of the same medicines. (Para 6.62) 17.Repeatable prescriptions should be available on the NHS. (Para 6.65) 18.Limits should be introduced for the number of times a repeatable prescription can be dispensed and the duration of its validity .These restrictions should apply across all sectors, and not be limited to NHS practice. (Para 6.65) 19.W h e re part i c u l a rextensions to prescribing authority could involve significant cost to the NHS, orw h e re the balance of cost and benefit appears to be uncertain, there should be a t h o rough evaluation of the likely costs and benefits to the NHS before general adoption is encouraged. This should not be allowed to result in unnecessary delays in improving car e . (Para 7.9) 20.The Government should take general powers in primary legislation, enabling ministers, through regulations, to designate new categories of dependent and independent prescribers for the purpose of the Medicines Act, to authorise them to prescribe medicines for reimbursement by the NHS, and to limit or specify the medicines or classes of medicines which they may prescribe. (Para 8.7) 25.The new arrangements should be subject to evaluation and monitoring, for which appropriate resources should be made available. (Para 8.19) Recommendations to Health Departments and professional bodies 4.There should be adequate arrangements for sharing information between independent and dependent prescribers. In particular ,S u m m a r y and Recommendations 5iboth clinicians should have access to a complete medication record, and iiboth clinicians should have access to relevant parts of the patient's medical record. (Para 6.19) 5.Changes to patterns of clinical care using new models for the prescribing, supply and administration of medicines should be introduced only after full consultation with patient interests, and should wherever possible increase patient choice. (Para 6.23) 11.Initial prescribing and supply of medicines should normally remain separate functions in orderto protect patient safety and provide other safeguards. Where a prescription cannot be furnished, the current arrangements for the emergency sale or supply of medicines should apply . (Para 6.59) Recommendation to Health Departments, professional bodies, HAs and employers 12.Where exceptionally it is in the interests of patients for the same professional to be responsible for prescription and supply of medicines, this should be subject to clinical audit and probity checks. (Para 6.59) Recommendations to professional bodies 7.Proposals for new professional groups to be considered as potential prescribers will be expected to come from nationally recognised organisations. They should confirm that the group is formally recognised by the appropriate regulatory body and that that body has seen and is content with the proposed arrangements for training in prescribing and for registration. (Para 6.33) 13.Professional organisations, in putting forward proposals for extensions to prescribing, should consider whether this could result in members prescribing and supplying POMs to the same patient, and if so what safeguards are required to maintain patient safety and ensure probity .The NPAC, in assessing any proposals from professional groups which could result in members prescribing and supplying POMs to the same patient, should consider the adequacy of the safeguards proposed. (Para 6.59) 15.Professional organisations, in putting forward proposals for new groups of professionals to have the authority to prescribe certain medicines, should consider the implications for administration of medicines and should ensure that all necessary training aspects ar e covered in their proposals. (Para 6.62)Review of Prescribing, Supply & Administration of Medicines - Final Report 621.Professional groups putting forward proposals for extended prescribing should liaise with education providers and bodies responsible for approving training courses to develop suitable training programmes in the required prescribing competencies. All training should include a period of supervised practice, and professional and regulator y bodies should take firm action against supervisors who fail to discharge their responsibilities. (Para 8.9) 22.The professional regulatory bodies should draw up clear guidelines on the circumstances in which commercial support or sponsorship for training programmes related to prescribing could be acceptable. Training programmes should not be used to promote particular products. (Para 8.12) 23.Professional organisations considering applying for extended prescribing authority should, in conjunction with the appropriate professional regulatory organisations, ensur e that adequate arrangements would be established for iaccrediting training programmes for prescribing; iimaintaining a register of individuals who have acquired and are maintaining competency as prescribers; iiireviewing the results of clinical audit programmes and ensuring that any general lessons are fed back into the content of training; ivkeeping the content of the prescribing formulary under review and submitting any proposals for change to the Medicines Control Agency . (Para 8.13) Recommendations to the GMC/GDC and postgraduate deans 8.The GMC and postgraduate deans should agree a safe framework within which pre- registration house officers (PRHOs) could prescribe medicines relevant to the duties of theirpost. Such prescribing should be subject to close monitoring by their clinical supervisor, with due regard to the proper discharge of supervisory responsibility as specified in Recommendation 21. (Para 6.51) 9.Overseas doctors given provisional registration by the GMC and required to undertake clinical training similar to that of a PRHO, and overseas dentists, given temporar y registration by the GDC to practise in an approved training post in a NHS hospital, should be able to prescribe under similarsafeguards to those described in Recommendation 8. (Para 6.52)S u m m a r y and Recommendations 7Recommendation to employers 16.Employers and managers in all sectors who are responsible for staff who supervise or undertake the administration of any medicines should ensure that those staff have the right training and skills to do so safely and regular opportunities for updating their knowledge. (Para 6.62) Recommendation to individual practitioners 24.All legally authorised prescribers should take personal responsibility for maintaining and updating their knowledge and practice related to prescribing, including taking par t in clinical audit, and should never prescribe in situations beyond their professional competence. (Para 8.14)Review of Prescribing, Supply & Administration of Medicines - Final Report 8Chapter 1: Introduction Terms of Reference 1.1The Review of Prescribing, Supply & Administration of Medicines was established in March 1997 with the following terms of reference:- \"Bearing in mind the overriding need to ensure patient safety, the effective use of resources, the skills and competencies of the various health professions, and recent changes in clinical practice and public expectations: 1.to develop a consistent policy framework to guide judgements on the circumstances in which health professionals inside and outside the NHS might undertake new responsibilities with regard to the prescribing, supply and administration of medicines; 2.to advise on the likely impact of any proposed changes on clinical outcomes, the convenience of health service users, professional relationships and costs; 3.to consider the possible implications for legislation, and for professional training and standards; 4.in particular, to advise on the supply or administration of medicines by nurses and other health professionals under \"group protocols\", and on any safeguards which should apply; and to make recommendations to ministers on item 4 within six months and on all other matters within 12 months.\" 1.2The Review was Chaired by Dr June Crown CBE, Past-President of the Faculty of Public Health Medicine. The members of the Review Team and the 4 sub-groups set up to support the Review are listed in Annex A. Other experts who advised the Review Team are listed in Annex B. 1.3The first report of the Review, concerned with the supply and administration of medicines by group protocols, was published in April 1998.1Asummary of the recommendations of the first report is at Annex C. This met the requirement of the fourth of the terms of reference and work is being undertaken to implement the recommendations, including any clarification of the law that may be necessary . 1.4This report addresses the other terms of reference. I n t ro d u c t i o n 91Review of prescribing, supply and administration of medicines: A report on the supply and administration of medicines under group protocols (Department of Health, London, April 1998).Aims of this Review 1.5The aims of this Review are to:- vdevelop a framework to determine in what circumstances health professionals might undertake new roles with regard to the prescribing, supply and administration of medicines; vconsider the implications of proposed changes, including those for legislation and for professional training. 1.6The Review is concerned with the prescribing, supply and administration of medicinal products for human use. The Review does not deal with the dispensing of medicines.2It also does not include consideration of medical devices (medical appliances) nor the use of medicines in veterinary practice. 1.7The overriding principle of the Review is that any changes to existing roles must at the very least maintain, and preferably enhance, patient safety .The changes also need to bring about demonstrable benefits to patient care and be cost-effective. The primary legislation governing the prescribing, supply and administration of medicines is UK-wide and covers all sectors of health care, so the recommendations and their implications will have to be considered in all four countries and will apply to practice inside and outside the NHS. Our recommendations also have implications for the reimbursement of the costs of medicines under the NHS, which is covered by separate legislation (Annex D). Definition of terms 1.8During the course of the Review, it became clear to the Review Team that different interpretations are put upon many of the words used in this field. The Team has therefore produced a Glossary which sets out the definitions of terms used by the Team in this report. Acknowledgements 1.9Many people contributed to the work of this Review, either by sending in written submissions,3by serving on its subgroups (see chapter 4) or by providing technical advice. The Review Team is grateful to all those who helped with this work. The Team members also wish to place on record their thanks and appreciation for the hard work and unfailing support of all the secretariat and officials whose advice was invaluable in reaching our conclusions and forming recommendations.Review of Prescribing, Supply & Administration of Medicines - Final Report 102There is no legal distinction between \"dispense\" and \"supply\" although there are considerable differences in practice. The act of dispensing includes supply and also encompasses a number of other functions (eg checking the validity of the prescription, the appropriateness of the medicine for an individual patient, assembly of the product). In common usage \"dispense\" is usually reserved to the activity of pharmacists and dispensing doctors. 3Alist of organisations and individuals who submitted evidence to the Review is at Annex F .Chapter 2: The Present situation Who can prescribe, supply or administer medicines? 2.1Medicines are made available to the public under rules set out in legislation (the Medicines Act 1968) which are designed to ensure that effective products can be used safely according to the licensed indications (see Glossary) for use. 2.2The terms \"prescribe\", \"supply\" and \"administer\" are often used imprecisely and with overlap of meaning. The definitions we have used are as follows (see the Glossary for further amplification): Prescribe: in the strict legal sense, as used in the Medicines Act: ito order in writing the supply of a prescription only medicine for a named patient; but commonly used in the extended sense of: iito authorise by means of an NHS prescription the supply of any medicine (not just a prescription only medicine) at public expense; and occasionally: iii to advise a patient on suitable care or medication (including medicine which may be purchased over the counter). In this report prescribing is usually used in sense (i) and (ii), unless the context makes clear that sense (iii) is intended. Supply: to provide a medicine directly to a patient or carer for administration.4 Administer: to give a medicine either by introduction into the body, whether by direct contact with the body or not (eg orally or by injection), or by external application (eg application of an impregnated dressing). 2.3Under the Medicines Act, a written prescription is required only for certain medicines called prescription only medicines (POMs - see para 2.7 and Glossary). For many years, the only prescribers of POMs for human use were fully registered doctors and dentists. Dentists normally limit their prescribing to drugs appropriate to dentistry .5The Present Situation 114See footnote 2 on page 10. 5The General Dental Council (GDC) takes the view that a dentist should only prescribe drugs in connection with bona fide treatment (Maintaining standards , GDC, November 1997).2.4In 1989 an advisory group considered the circumstances under which nurses working in the community might prescribe and recommended that certain nurses holding district nurse or health visitor qualifications should be allowed to prescribe from a limited formulary .6The necessary legislation came into force in 1994. Pilot schemes were introduced and thoroughly evaluated.7The Secretary of State for Health announced in April 1998 plans to implement nationally the current nurse prescribing scheme in England. 2.5The principal route of supply is through pharmacists. As a general principle, only pharmacists may supply POMs and pharmacy medicines (P - see para 2.7 and Glossary). This principle can however be relaxed in order to allow other health professionals to supply medicines in the course of providing health care. The details are complex (see Annex D) but the main exceptions are: imedicines legislation allows doctors and dentists to supply or administer any medicine direct to their patients; iinurses and other health care workers may supply products in the course of the business of a hospital or health centre, in accordance with the directions of a doctor or dentist; iiicertain medicines may be sold or supplied by specified health professionals, including chiropodists, optometrists, and midwives, in the course of their professional practice. 2.6There are further restrictions on the administration of POMs by injection (parenteral administration), which must be carried out under the directions of a doctor or dentist except ifor certain drugs, in an emergency (eg adrenaline, hydrocortisone); iifor some medicines available to certain health professionals, for example ambulance paramedics, who may administer them by injection in the course of their professional practice. POM, Pand GSL medicines 2.7There are 3 legal categories of medicines, grouped according to their potency and risk of adverse side effects and the need for the supply to be professionally supervised. They are:- iPOM: prescription only medicines .These may normally only be sold or supplied against the signed prescription of an \"appropriate practitioner\", ie a doctor or dentist or (for certain medicines) a nurse prescriber. (There are various exceptions which allowReview of Prescribing, Supply & Administration of Medicines - Final Report 126Report of the Advisory Group on Nurse Prescribing (Department of Health, London, 1989). Alist of the prescription only medicines which prescribing nurses may prescribe is at Schedule 3 to the Prescription Only Medicines (Human Use) Order 1997. The Nurse Prescribers'Formulary also includes a number of Pand GSLmedicines which a prescribing nurse may authorise for NHS reimbursement by issuing an NHS prescription. 7Luker K, Austin L, Hogg C et al, Evaluation of nurse prescribing, final repor t(Universities of Liverpool and York, January 1998).the supply or administration of POMs without a prescription - see paras 2.5-2.6 and Annex D). POMs must be supplied to the patient or carer by a pharmacist or under the supervision of a pharmacist. ii P: Pharmacy medicines .These must be supplied or sold by a pharmacist or under the supervision of a pharmacist in registered pharmacy premises (for exemptions to these provisions see para 2.5 and Annex D). iii GSL: General Sales List medicines. These can be supplied direct to the public in an unopened manufacturer 's pack at any lockable business premises. Payment from public funds 2.8The arrangements outlined above relate to the legal safeguards that govern prescribing, supply and administration of medicines. They apply to all health care delivery systems in the United Kingdom and to both private and NHS practice. They are found in the Medicines Act 1968 and subordinate legislation made under it. 2.9There are separate regulations, derived from the National Health Service Act 1977,8which govern the payment from public funds for medicines.9The key provisions ipermit reimbursement of pharmacists for the cost of dispensing prescriptions from an authorised prescriber; iiplace restrictions on the medicines which doctors, dentists and others may prescribe on the NHS; iiirestrict the powers of doctors in general practice (except for dispensing doctors) to supply medicines from their surgeries; ivallow doctors in England and Wales to be reimbursed for the cost of medicines which they personally administer to their patients. In Scotland and Northern Ireland, doctors requisition these medicines from community pharmacists who then claim reimbursement. 2.10Amedicine, irrespective of its legal status, can only be dispensed under NHS arrangements against an NHS prescription, which is required even if the medicine is classified as P or GSL. Thus, an \"NHS prescription\" serves three purposes: iit fulfils the legal requirements authorising the supply of a POM under medicines legislation; The Present Situation 138The Health and Personal Social Services (Northern Ireland) Order 1972 in Northern Ireland. 9The main provisions are the NHS (General Medical Services) Regulations 1992, the NHS (General Dental Services) Regulations 1992, the NHS (Pharmaceutical Services) Regulations 1992, and their equivalents for Scotland and Northern Ireland.iiit identifies the medicine which is to be supplied to the patient (which need not necessarily be a POM); and iiiit authorises payment for that medicine from public funds. As a general rule, NHS prescriptions are specific to individual patients.10 2.11In NHS hospitals, medicines for inpatients are generally ordered using a combined prescription, supply and administration record card (or medicine chart). This is not a prescription form but sets out the written directions of an appropriate practitioner, usually a doctor, and includes details such as the patient's name, drug name, dose and frequency. In that sense, it fulfils an equivalent function to the prescription in NHS primary care. Similarly for outpatients, and for inpatients requiring medicines to take away on discharge, the form used to convey the practitioner 's directions to the hospital pharmacy contains information similar to that in an NHS prescription. Hospital doctors can also write prescriptions for dispensing in the community, using a modified version of the prescription form used for GP prescribing. Regulatory mechanisms The Medicines Commission and the Committee on Safety of Medicines 2.12When making decisions on changes to legislation which affect the supply and administration of medicines, Ministers receive advice from the Medicines Commission and the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM). These are independent advisory bodies established under the Medicines Act 1968 whose members are appointed by Ministers. 2.13The Medicines Commission, established under Section 2 of the Medicines Act, has a very broad remit to advise Ministers on any matter relating to human and veterinary medicines within the scope of the Medicines Act. This includes licensing matters, questions relating to the sale and supply of medicines, and the publication of reference works relating to medicines. One specific duty is recommending the establishment of advisory bodies for particular purposes as provided for under Section 4 of the Act (see para 2.14). As part of its wider role it advises Ministers on the risk to public health of particular policy initiatives. 2.14Committees established under Section 4 may be set up for any purpose or combination of purposes connected with the Act. At present, there are four: the CSM, the Veterinary Products Committee, the British Pharmacopoeia Commission, and the Advisory Board on the Registration of Homoeopathic Products. The CSM advises on the safety, quality and efficacy of medicines, both with regard to licensing issues, legal classification and pharmacovigilance and to the powers of health professionals to supply or administer specified medicines.Review of Prescribing, Supply & Administration of Medicines - Final Report 1410There are exceptions - for example, a doctor who is responsible for at least 10 persons residing in a school or other institution may prescribe for them by means of a \"bulk prescription\".2.15The impact of any proposed change to secondary legislation affecting the sale and supply of medicines is considered, as appropriate, by the CSM and the Medicines Commission. Ministers are required to take account of their advice. They are also required to consult representatives of interests which are likely to be affected such as professional, trade and consumer bodies. Professional self-regulation 2.16Most health professions have some form of professional self-regulation which covers requirements for registration and entry to the profession, specialisation, continuing professional development, and provision for removal or suspension from the professional register in cases of professional misconduct, incompetence or severe health problems. 2.17The arrangements for the medical profession illustrate these essential features in a highly developed form. There are three main components: ithe General Medical Council (GMC) determines the requirements for registration as a doctor and has powers to visit and inspect UK Medical Schools and their qualifying examinations. Following satisfactory completion of further specialist training in hospital specialities, a doctor 's name can be included on the relevant specialist register of the GMC. This is now a pre-condition for taking up substantive consultant posts in the NHS. Statutory subcommittees determine allegations of professional misconduct, poor performance, and health problems serious enough to affect performance, through a quasi-judicial process in which the doctor may be legally represented. On the basis of their recommendations the GMC has power to remove doctors from the register, to suspend their registration or to impose conditions on their continued practice; iithe Specialist Training Authority was established in 1996. It approves doctors for entry to the GMC's specialist register, either (on advice from the relevant Medical Royal College or Faculty) by award of the Certificate of Completion of Specialist Training (CCST) or by assessing the doctor 's training and qualifications as equivalent to CCST standards. Doctors who have been awarded specialist certificates in other EU states may apply directly to the GMC for entry to the specialist register; iiithe Medical Royal Colleges and Faculties are responsible for the supervision and standards of postgraduate education and training, conducting postgraduate examinations, and arrangements for continuing professional development (CPD) (also know as continuing medical education, CME). 2.18Arrangements for dentistry are broadly similar, with the General Dental Council (GDC) fulfilling the role of the regulatory body and the Faculties of Dental Surgery and General Dental Practitioners of the Royal College of Surgeons advising on educational standards including postgraduate training in the dental specialties. The GDC also fulfils the role of the Specialist Training Authority by approving as well as registering dental specialists.The Present Situation 152.19The General Optical Council is the regulatory body in optometry and the College of Optometrists is responsible for professional and educational standards. Optometric specialties are not yet registered but the College manages a programme of continuing education. 2.20Arrangements for nursing, midwifery and health visiting are similar to those for medicine, though with some significant differences in the roles of the various bodies involved: iThe United Kingdom Central Council for Nursing, Midwifery & Health Visiting is established in statute and is charged with maintaining a professional register of qualified nurses, midwives and health visitors; providing advice on professional standards; setting standards for education, practice and conduct; and dealing with misconduct or unfitness to practice due to ill health; iiProgrammes of education leading to registration are approved by the four National Boards. Some post basic education courses, such as health visiting and district nursing, are already registrable or recordable with the UKCC. Further specialist practice courses leading to a recordable qualification are being developed; iiiContinuing professional development is mandatory for all nurses, midwives and health visitors and is linked to three-yearly renewal of their registration. 2.21The Nurses, Midwives and Health Visitors Act, which establishes the UKCC and National Boards and sets out their functions and powers, has recently been reviewed and a report is currently with ministers. The outcome of this review is unlikely to have any fundamental implications for the recommendations of our report. 2.22Asingle professional body, the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain (RPSGB)11, is responsible for promoting standards within the pharmacy profession and for professional regulation. The RPSGB iapproves the standards of university degree courses in pharmacy and the arrangements for the pre-registration year, including the pre-registration examination; iimaintains a register of qualified pharmacists; and iiideals with disciplinary issues through its Statutory Committee, which has the powers to remove practitioners from the register . Afield force of inspectors visit pharmacists to ensure compliance with the law and with professional standards. Participation in continuing professional development is a professional obligation under the Society's Code of Ethics.Review of Prescribing, Supply & Administration of Medicines - Final Report 1611In Northern Ireland, the Pharmaceutical Society of Northern Ireland.2.23The Council for the Professions Supplementary to Medicine (CPSM) and its professional Boards were established by the Professions Supplementary to Medicine Act 1960. It regulates the initial training and subsequent professional practice of nine varts therapists (art, drama and music). The Boards are responsible for promoting high standards of professional education and conduct amongst members, approving training institutions, qualifications and courses, and maintaining registers of those people who have qualified for state registration (the first seven in the list above. State registration, where available, is a requirement for employment in the NHS and in Local Authority social services. Registers for the last two professions are now being assembled. 2.24The Government has announced its intention to repeal the Professions Supplementary to Medicine (PSM) Act, and to replace it with arrangements based on the recommendations of an independent review published in 1996.The Present Situation 17Chapter 3: Pressures for Change Introduction 3.1The historic relationships between doctors, dentists, nurses and pharmacists are long established. The doctor 's and dentist's key skills, in the context of this review, are in clinical assessment and diagnosis, and they are responsible for advising on any treatment necessary for the patient's care, including prescribing medication when required. Traditionally, the pharmacist prepared medicines and dispensed12them to the patient. The nurse, as part of the nursing care of the patient, might administer , or supplyto patients for self-administration, medicines prescribed by the doctor . 3.2This traditional description of professional relationships and patterns of care no longer fully reflects the needs of modern clinical practice. Changes in the training and roles of health care professionals from all disciplines, and the widening range, potency and formulation of medicines mean that the arrangements for prescribing, supply and administration of medicines need to be re-examined, with a view to improving the effectiveness and efficiency of health care.1 3 3.3In addition, patients are no longer passive recipients of services, but have increasing expertise in the management of their conditions especially when these are long-standing. Medicines are often self-administered by patients or administered by their carers. Changes in prescribing arrangements should therefore seek to support current efforts to enable patients to be more involved in their treatment and more in control of their own health. Changes should also improve the convenience of services for patients and carers and explicitly value their time, as well as that of health care professionals. Changes in professional education and training 3.4The education and clinical practice of many health care professions has changed over the last twenty years. Examples include: van increasing degree of specialisation in many disciplines including medicine, dentistry and nursing, some of which are reflected in regulatory changes: a large number of new medical and dental specialties and subspecialties have become recognised, with training programmes approved by the relevant Royal Colleges and Faculties. Recognised specialties are now registrable with the GMC/GDC on their Specialist Registers.Review of Prescribing, Supply & Administration of Medicines - Final Report 1812For the distinction between dispensing and supply see the Glossary and footnote 2 on page 10. Consideration of issues relating to dispensing are outside the remit of this Review . 13See Responsible self-care, including self-medication , Joint Statement by the British Medical Association, Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain, National Proprietary Association, Royal College of General Practitioners and the Royal College of Nurses on the role of inter-professional teamwork in the provision of medicines (January 1998).in nursing, new specialties with recognised training programmes include intensive care, practice nursing, community children's nursing, respiratory care, sexual health, diabetes and tissue viability. Some of these specialist qualifications can be recorded with the UKCC. van increasing emphasis on pharmacists' clinical practice including the provision of advice to patients and to other prescribers on the appropriate choice and therapeutic use of medicines. This draws on pharmacists' knowledge of the range, efficacy, safety and cost-effectiveness of drug treatments. It also builds on their understanding of pharmacokinetic principles, drug interactions, side effects and available products. vgreater opportunities for autonomous practice in many professions, often linked to extensive post-graduate education and specialisation. For example, the role of physiotherapists includes diagnosis in specific areas and extended autonomous practice including manipulation; chiropodists and podiatrists may now undertake foot surgery; and ambulance paramedics administer medicines to patients in their care. vthe growing professionalisation of primary care, as shown by the introduction of compulsory vocational training for GPs and the development of specialist qualifications for practice nurses, coupled with a greater recognition of the value of preventative health care and of the need to consider the health care needs of entire populations. va growing emphasis on the need for clinical practice to be based as far as possible on rigorous evidence, and the related development of evidence-based aids to clinical practice such as clinical guidelines, protocols, computerised decision support, and associated audit methodologies. 3.5It is desirable that highly trained health professionals should be able to use their full range of skills in the interests of better patient care, the efficient use of resources and enhanced job satisfaction. It is essential, however, that the extension of professional roles is accompanied by clear arrangements for accountability. One professional should not be expected to take responsibility for clinical decisions that are actually taken by a colleague - for instance, if a district nurse has in fact decided on the appropriate clinical dressing for a particular patient, and the GP has not in any real sense reviewed this decision, it is wrong for the GP to take formal clinical responsibility by signing the prescription. This is not only professionally inappropriate for both parties, but it can lead to confusion which may prejudice patient safety and reduce confidence in the arrangements for care. Changes in patient expectations 3.6Patients, especially those with chronic and recurring health problems, and their carers are becoming increasingly expert about the management of their own conditions. They may choose to seek advice from a wider range of health professionals, both in the public and private sector, than has been usual in the past. The process of consultation itself isP re s s u r e for Change 19increasingly seen as a dialogue between patient and professional, rather than as a one-way process of imparting expert advice.14 3.7However, there remain considerable problems about patients' \"concordance\" with professional advice, and therefore with their adherence to recommended treatments.15Where communication between patients and health professionals is inadequate, patients may not always acquire the information they need. Other factors may play a part, such as the patients' own health beliefs, or the influence of family and friends. In some instances, patients may prefer to seek advice from a particular health professional because of ease of access, because a relationship of trust has been built up in the course of a series of consultations, or because of a perception that the particular professional is more appropriate or will have more time available. The patients' social circumstances (eg homelessness, language barriers, or other special needs) may also leave them with limited access to the full range of health services. 3.8There may be unfortunate consequences when, for whatever reason, medicines are not taken as prescribed. The progress of the patients'own conditions may be affected, so that they may need further treatment or even admission to hospital. There may also be important public health implications for others, as for example through the emergence of resistant strains of bacteria when antibiotic treatment is inadequate.16,17Medicines may also be wasted or unused,18with consequent cost implications. Changes in professional relationships 3.9Treatment and care are increasingly provided by multidisciplinary teams of health professionals. Individual team members usually act with a measure of autonomy in relation to their areas of expertise. They make relevant clinical assessments of patients, take decisions on management including the decision to refer to a doctor or other team member when necessary . They are accountable for their clinical interventions and for the maintenance of their professional competence. These team working arrangements have been instituted in the majority of care settings. 3.10In some instances, the decision about whether or not to prescribe a medicine is, for all practical purposes, taken by a team member who is not a doctor. In order to comply with theReview of Prescribing, Supply & Administration of Medicines - Final Report 2014Herxheimer Aand Stimpson GV, \"The use of medicines Blum R, Herxheimer A, Stenzl C, Woodcock J (eds) Pharmaceuticals and Health Policy ( Holmes and Meier, New York, 1981). 15RPSGB Working Party (Chairman Professor Marshall Marinker) From Compliance to Concordance (RPSGB, London, 1997). 16The path of least resistance: A report by the Standing Medical Advisory Committee Sub-Group on Antimicrobial Resistance (Department of Health, London, 1998). 17House of Lords Science and Technology Committee, Resistance to antibiotics and other antimicrobial agents:seventh report from the Science and Technology Committee: Session 1997-98 (London: Stationery Office, 1998 (HL81; Vol 1)). 18Woolf M,Residual medicines :A report on OPCS omnibus survey data produced on behalf of theDepartment of Health (London: HMSO, 1995).law, the doctor is then asked to sign the prescription, even if he or she has not clinically assessed the patient. Increasingly, a team member who is not a doctor will assess a patient' s condition and advise a change to the medicine regime. Such decisions currently require a doctor's authorisation in the form of a signed prescription. Changes in the range and complexity of medicines 3.11Potent medicines are now available for the treatment of conditions for which until relatively recently there were no effective remedies. The increase in the range and complexity of medicines available and new delivery systems, together with the needs of an ageing population which includes many patients with multiple pathologies, mean that it is increasingly difficult for individual clinicians to claim expertise across the whole range of drug treatments relevant to their practice or to have a detailed understanding of other related fields. The development of clinical guidelines and computerised decision support is one response to this problem. Implications for this review 3.12The trends described in this chapter, for health professionals and for patients, have not been fully reflected in changes in the arrangements under which medicines are prescribed, supplied and administered. The task of the Review Team was to consider what changes might be needed to modernise the provision of medicines in the light of changing circumstances. P re s s u r e for Change 21Chapter 4: General Principles, Work Programme and Information Gathering 4.1The Review Team met sixteen times between March 1997 and August 1998. Its meetings included a two-day workshop in February 1998, and two meetings, in July 1997 and May 1998, with members of the Review sub-groups. Other experts, listed in Annex B, joined the May 1998 meeting. 4.2The Review Team decided at the outset that its work should be transparent and that every effort would be made to obtain a wide range of views on the issues under discussion. Team members were appointed as individual experts rather than as representatives of organisations or professional groups, but they were expected to consult colleagues about aspects of the work of the Review. Press releases were issued at intervals to provide wider information about the progress of the Review .19 4.3In its early meetings, the Review Team agreed on the methodology that it wished to pursue in developing its work, the principles which it considered should underpin the review, and the issues on which it wished to seek wider views. General principles 4.4The Team established some general principles to inform and guide its work. These principles stood up well to more detailed consideration and helped us in due course to formulate our recommendations, although inevitably some details were subsequently refined. As initially set out, these principles were as follows: I.Overall Objective Any change from current practice should result in improved health outcomes, or else equivalent health outcomes with improved patient convenience or more appropriate professional practice. II.Criteria Any proposed change should be assessed against the following criteria:- ihealth outcomes and patient safety iipatient choiceReview of Prescribing, Supply & Administration of Medicines - Final Report 221913 February 1997 Announcement of review team ; 20 June 1997 Requests for submissions of evidence to the Review ; 21 April 1998 Publication of the Review Team's first report on the supply and administration of medicines under group protocols .iiipatient convenience ivprofessional appropriateness veffective use of resources These criteria apply across all health care settings. III.Principles iFactors contributing to patient safety and improved health outcomes a.All health professionals authorised to prescribe must be fully qualified and registered with a recognised regulatory body . b.All health professionals authorised to prescribe should have appropriate post qualification training. c.All health professionals authorised to prescribe should undertake continuing professional education relevant to their prescribing role. d.All health professionals authorised to prescribe should be so identified on the register of the relevant regulatory body and this information should be updated at specified intervals. e.Health professionals should only prescribe in circumstances where they are competent to assess all relevant aspects of the patient's clinical condition, to decide on an appropriate programme of clinical management and to take responsibility for prescribing and related decisions. f.No health professional should undertake any aspect of patient care for which they are not trained and which is beyond their professional competence. g.Overall responsibility for the co-ordination of care will normally remain with the general practitioner or, during episodes of hospital care, with a named lead consultant. h.All health professionals authorised to prescribe should have access to the patient's clinical records and schedules of medication. Wherever possible there should be integrated clinical records, with full regard to confidentiality . i.When responsibility for all or part of a patient's care is transferred from one professional to another, there should be transfer of full information on clinical status and medication, and the doctor with overall responsibility for the patient should be informed.General Principles, Work Programme and Information Gathering 23j.There should normally be a separation of responsibilities for prescribing and for dispensing. k.Arrangements for prescribing should take into account communications and other factors in the relationship between patient and practitioner which might affect the patient's willingness to follow the prescribed treatment. iiFactors contributing to patient choice a.Patients should be informed at all times about the professional background of clinicians responsible for aspects of their care. Wherever possible, patients should be allowed to choose the practitioner they wish to be responsible for their care, including prescribing. b.In assessing the value of changes in prescribing practice, particular attention should be paid to measures of patient satisfaction. iiiFactors contributing to patient convenience a.Arrangements for prescribing should, as far as possible, minimise delay between the clinical assessment, including a decision that a medicine is needed, and the patient obtaining the medicine. b.Arrangements for prescribing should minimise journeys by patients or their representatives solely for the purpose of picking up prescription forms. ivFactors contributing to professional appropriateness a.The health professional taking responsibility for clinical decisions and care should also be responsible for related prescribing decisions. b.No professional should be required to write or sign a prescription which relates to clinical care for which he/she is not personally responsible. vFactors contributing to effective use of resources a.Arrangements for prescribing should, as far as possible, avoid duplication of activities between health professionals. b.Arrangements for prescribing should seek to minimise travel time for staff, by reducing journeys made solely to obtain confirmation or signature of prescription forms.Review of Prescribing, Supply & Administration of Medicines - Final Report 24c.Practitioners with direct clinical responsibility for care should ensure that appropriate medicines are prescribed in appropriate quantities to minimise waste. 4.5The principles were circulated to all those involved in other stages of the Review . Consultation exercise 4.6The Review Team sought opinions on the existing arrangements and ideas for change through a major consultation exercise which took place during the summer of 1997. Aconsultation letter was sent to a large number of organisations and relevant professional journals. Over 750 submissions were received. The consultation letter is at Annex E and the circulation list and respondents are at Annex F . 4.7In view of the size of the response to the consultation exercise, the Minister for Health agreed to an extension of the timetable for the Review to allow all submissions to be thoroughly considered. Sub-groups 4.8The Review Team set up four sub-groups, each chaired by a Team member, in order to help it assess the submissions and formulate suggestions on possible options for change. The sub- groups were made up of members from a wider range of backgrounds than the Team itself (see Annex Afor the list of sub-group members, and terms of reference for the sub-groups). The Review Team members who did not serve on the sub-groups also assessed selected submissions and provided an extra source of advice to sub-group chairs. Every submission was considered by at least one member of the Review Team. 4.9 On receipt, each submission was allocated to the sub-group which reflected most closely the issues covered in the submission. Those submissions which were of a general nature were allocated to the sub-groups so that all had a similar workload. Each submission was analysed in detail by sub-group members against a pro-forma which mirrored the consultation letter . The responses were drawn together to form the basis of reports from the sub-groups to the Review Team. 4.10Since the Review Team was asked to develop a framework for change which would be robust for the future, it was not considered appropriate to divide the work of the sub-groups according to present organisational structures in the NHS. The Team chose, rather, to relate the work to public and patient needs, which are likely to remain stable and around which new patterns for the provision of care will have to be designed.General Principles, Work Programme and Information Gathering 254.11The focus for the work of the four sub-groups was:- Sub-group 1. \"Healthy\" people, ie those with self-limiting conditions and those capable of advised self-medication. Sub-group 2. People with chronic or progressive illness living in the community . Sub-group 3. People with serious conditions requiring rapid response including those in need of emergency or hospital care. Sub-group 4. People with mental health or behavioural problems, including those in prisons and special hospitals. 4.12Each sub-group met on a number of occasions between July and November 1997. The Review Team also continued to meet during this period. The sub-groups were reconvened for one meeting in May 1998, with other experts, in order to test the Team's emerging recommendations. Literature search and other international experience 4.13The Review Team commissioned the South East Institute of Public Health to carry out a short search of published information about current practice in the UK and overseas concerning the prescribing, supply and administration of medicines by health professionals other than doctors and dentists. It also wrote to a number of contacts in countries outside the United Kingdom, receiving 7 replies from national regulatory authorities with details of their current prescribing practice.Review of Prescribing, Supply & Administration of Medicines - Final Report 26Chapter 5: Summary of Evidence Sub-Groups 5.1Each sub-group produced a report for discussion by the full Team based on the responses to the consultation exercise and their own expertise. Although the sub-groups were looking at the needs of different patient groups, their findings showed a wide measure of consistency. In particular, each group recommended that the power to prescribe should be extended in specific circumstances to further groups of health professionals. The sub-group reports also informed the Review Team's first report on the supply and administration of medicines under group protocols, published on 21 April 1998.20 Summary of views received 5.2The consistent views which emerged from the response to consultation were: vmany valuable features of current arrangements should be retained, including the clear legal framework, the coordination of care by a single health professional, and the general principle of the separation of the prescribing of medicines from supply and administration; vcurrent arrangements fail to make the fullest use of the skills of many professionals; vthere is overwhelming support for an extension of prescribing to new groups of prescribers, in specific clinical areas related to their expertise and subject to nationally accredited training; vin certain circumstances, the precise choice of medicine can be decided by a professional other than the clinician who carries out the initial assessment; vthe risk of fragmentation of care is recognised, but can be overcome by better team- working, communications and use of information technology; vthere should be wider use of repeat dispensing or repeat supply arrangements; vsupply and administration of medicines under group protocol is acceptable in certain limited clinical circumstances. 5.3Afuller summary is at Annex G.S u m m a r y of Evidence 2720Review of prescribing, supply and administration of medicines: A report on the supply and administration of medicines under group protocols (Department of Health, London, April 1998) issued under cover of Health Service Circular (HSC)1998/051 in England, Management Executive Letter (MEL) (98)29 in Scotland, Welsh Health Circular (WHC) (98)27 in Wales, and by each Chief Professional Officer to their respective professional groups in Northern Ireland. Conclusions from the sub-groups 5.4The reports from the sub-groups were all considered by the Review Team as a whole. Final conclusions are set out in later chapters and summarised in the recommendations in chapter 9. The main issues identified by the sub-groups were: iEach sub-group considered that there should be an extension of some prescribing responsibilities to some health professionals. The groups suggested various safeguards to support this recommendation, including: vthere should be an agreed framework for the extension of prescribing powers, determined by the core competencies, knowledge and skills of the members of the profession involved; vthe training of newly authorised groups of prescribers should match the tasks associated with changed responsibilities; vtraining should be to a nationally accredited standard, approved and registered by relevant professional organisations; vnew prescribers should be required at appropriate intervals to demonstrate continuing competence to prescribe; vthere should be clear arrangements to ensure the professional accountability of prescribers; vany new responsibilities for prescribing, supply and administration should be subject to evaluation and clinical audit, linked to mechanisms to improve practice and remedy deficiencies. iiMost of these proposed safeguards are equally relevant to existing prescribers and many are already required in current arrangements. Although it is outside the remit of the Review Team to make formal recommendations in this area, we suggest that the relevant medical and dental professional bodies may wish to review arrangements for initial training, continuing professional development and audit in the light of the general principles we recommend for new prescribers. iii The sub-groups considered that prescribing should continue to be kept separate from the supply of medicines, except in circumstances where the patient requires immediate treatment. iv The sub-group dealing with mental health issues considered that there should be better arrangements for the immediate supply of medicines in the Prison Service. Review of Prescribing, Supply & Administration of Medicines - Final Report 28vThis subgroup also recommended that only doctors should prescribe in the field of child and adolescent psychiatry, because of professional concern about the treatment with drugs of children and young people with mental health problems, and because many medicines in this area are not currently licensed for paediatric use. vi Three of the sub-groups considered that it was not always necessary for the same professional to diagnose and to prescribe. The sub-group on patients with serious conditions requiring rapid response considered that, in the special circumstances of emergency care, there should be no separation between the diagnosis and the initial prescribing decision. vii Two of the sub-groups developed new models for prescribing in different situations. These included \"independent\" prescribing, to be extended to certain highly skilled health professionals, and \"dependent\" prescribing (which could include a variety of models, including initial prescribing by protocol). viiiAll of the sub-groups placed a high priority on safeguarding the interests of patients. Any changes must take into account the need to protect patient safety, ensure good continuity of care, avoid fragmentation and safeguard patient choice and convenience. Changes in the management of care or professional responsibility should as far as possible be subject to patients'informed agreement. ix Each of the sub-groups supported the development of better patient records, accessible to all prescribers, with due regard to the confidentiality of patient-identifiable data.21 Recommendations included the development of a single, integrated patient record system, and the development of a framework for communication and information systems. 5.5The consultation raised several issues related to the work of the review which did not form part of the review terms of reference. These matters were, however, identified by the sub- groups and are commended to relevant policy areas in the UK Government Departments. They are described at Annex H. International experience 5.6Apart from the United Kingdom itself, the countries with the most experience to date of prescribing by professionals other than doctors and dentists are Sweden and the USA.22The majority of evidence relates to nurses and pharmacists. It should not, of course, be assumed that experience in other health care systems would be exactly replicated in the United Kingdom.S u m m a r y of Evidence 2921Report on the review of patient-identifiable information (\"Caldicott\" report, Department of Health, December 1997). 22See Report of the Working Group advising on the quality and safety issues associated with extending limited prescribing rights to registered nurses (New Zealand Ministry of Health, Wellington, November 1997) for a fuller summary .Prescribing by nurses 5.7District nurses and health visitors in Sweden have been prescribing dressings and appliances for about 20 years. Following a pilot scheme in 1988, a nurse prescribing scheme was introduced in 1994. This allows district nurses with a postgraduate qualification and additional training in pharmacology to prescribe from a list of oral medications for 60 specific indications. 5.8In the USA, nurse prescribing has been closely associated with the development of the concept of \"nurse practitioners\", who have undergone postgraduate training in particular specialist areas in either primary or secondary care. Training differs from Sweden or the UK in placing considerable stress on diagnostic skills. Details vary from state to state; most set limits on the setting for prescribing or on the type of drugs that can be prescribed, and in some states nurses may only prescribe within protocols laid down by a supervising physician. In most states nurse prescribers must undergo mandatory continuing education and audit. At the end of 1997, 49 states allowed some form of nurse prescribing. 5.9Australia and New Zealand are also considering introducing some forms of nurse prescribing. New South Wales is considering proposals for nurse prescribing in specialist areas such as neonatal intensive care, and also in primary care in remote rural areas. The New Zealand working party already referred to23has recommended a pilot study in one specific area of specialist practice. 5.10Much of the literature is descriptive or presents essentially theoretical arguments for the benefits or risks of extending prescribing; evidence from well-conducted studies is sparse, and much of it comes from the USA and may not be directly applicable to the health care system in the UK. The available evidence suggests: iAcceptability - where nurse prescribing has been introduced, it has been readily accepted both by patients and by other professionals.24 iiPatient/professional relationship - the UK research suggests that health visitors are considered \"more approachable\" than GPs and that patients feel more able to discuss areas of concern. Some USA studies reported concern by patients about communication with nurse practitioners,25competence to deal with serious medical problems,26andReview of Prescribing, Supply & Administration of Medicines - Final Report 3023See foonote 22 on page 29. 24Luker K, Austin L, Hogg C et al, Evaluation of nurse prescribing, final repor t(Universities of Liverpool and York, January 1998). 25Levine D, Morlock L, Mshlin Aet al, \"The role of new health practitioners in a prepaid group practice: provider differences in process and outcome of medical care\", Prev Med 14(4)(1976) 326-47. 26Kubala S and Clever L, \"Acceptance of the nurse practitioner\", American Journal of Nursing 74(3)(1974) 451-2.readiness to consult physicians about diagnostic and treatment decisions,27but these all relate to practice many years ago. iiiAccess to car e- more recent US literature28suggests that prescribing by nurse specialists \"has increased access to care for many individuals and families\". ivTimeliness of treatment - in a survey of nurse practitioners in the USA29more than half reported delays in patient treatment resulting from their (then) inability to prescribe, and 11% reported significant delay likely to affect the patient's health. vAppropriateness of treatment - the evidence is limited. One study in a UK dermatology ward30found that nurses' choice of topical medication was better correlated with the \"gold standard\" of their consultants than that of the junior doctors on the ward. A similar study of primary care prescribing in the US31found that nurse practitioners scored better than physicians when assessed by a multi-disciplinary panel of experts. Another study in US primary care32found that nurse practitioners prescribed medications less frequently than physicians and tended to use a very restricted range of drugs though the study did not comment on appropriateness. viUse of resources - evidence from the initial UK pilot study sites33showed mixed results. In some practices nurse prescribers identified areas of waste and achieved very significant reductions in prescribing costs, while in others prescribing costs and volume rose, suggesting some previously unmet need. More detailed, recent analysis of prescribing data covering a longer period of time and a wider range of nurse prescribers, suggests that there should be no overall increase in prescribing costs as a result of introducing nurse prescribing, if properly managed (unpublished). The UK research also identified significant savings in the time of nurses and GPs, though it wasS u m m a r y of Evidence 3127Enggist R and Hatcher M, \"Factors influencing consumer receptivity to the nurse practitioner\" J Med Syst 7(6)(1983) 495-512; Rodeghero J \"Perceptions of nurse practitioners among the rural poor\" Nurse Practitioner 3(5)(1978) 7. 28Talley S and Brooke P, \"Prescriptive authority for psychiatric clinical specialists: framing the issues\", Archives of Psychiatric Nursing 6(2)(1992) 71-82. 29Biester D and Collins J, \"Prescriptive authority for nurse practitioners: a strategy for improving access to child health care\", Journal of Pediatric Nursing 6(6)(1991) 419-420. 30Cox N, Walton Yand Bowman J, \"Evaluation of in a \"Appropriateness of practitioners and physicians\", Image26(1)(1994) 41-6. 32Rosenaur J, Stanford D, Morgan Wet al, \"Prescribing behaviours of primary care nurse practitioners\", Am J Public Health 74(1984) 10-13. 33Luker K, Austin L, Hogg C et al, Evaluation of nurse prescribing, final repor t(Universities of Liverpool and York, January 1998).not clear how this should be valued. US research suggests that nurse practitioners tend to prescribe less than physicians,34and it has been suggested that improved care by nurse practitioners can result in savings on secondary care costs.35 Prescribing by pharmacists 5.11In the USA, 17 states, at the time of our literature review, allowed pharmacists to prescribe under protocols from a physician. Here, the pharmacists receive delegated authority to prescribe, and share with collaborating physicians the risk and responsibility for the patients' overall outcome, except in Florida, where pharmacists prescribe independently, albeit from a very limited formulary .36 5.12There is more extensive experience of pharmacists undertaking related activities , such as carrying out medicines reviews, advising doctors on choice of medicines, and counselling patients. Pharmacists also regularly advise patients on the choice of P and GSL medicines (the third sense of \"prescribe\" in the Glossary). In relation to these activities, the literature (much of it from UK experience) suggests: iAcceptability/access - pharmacists' involvement in prescribing has been accepted for some time in hospital practice.37Similarly, the role of the pharmacist in managing minor ailments in community practice has received acceptance by many prescribers, particularly over the last five years in response to its potential for reducing the NHS prescribing budget.38 Studies of clientacceptability for the management of minor ailments or 'counter - prescribing'have shown that the community pharmacy is recognised as the first port of call for people seeking advice and/or treatment for minor ailments.

In one study, interventions were made by the pharmacist on 3.3% of all individual drug prescriptions, corresponding to around 20% of all patients. Of these interventions, 57% were classified as being either moderate (e.g. therapeutic drug monitoring) or major (e.g. total parenteral nutrition calculation).43There are also examples of pharmacist involvement in specialist areas of care, such as HIV .44 Primary care pharmacy Community pharmacists do not have access to patients'full medication records. Many have therefore established computerised patient medication records (PMRs) which are useful in supplying details that are missing from prescriptions. In one study 17% of repeat prescriptions omitted quantities or dosages that were resolved using the PMR.45 Protocols were introduced into community pharmacies in 1996 to improve the service, following criticism by the Consumers'Association. Pharmacy staff now ask relevant questions in accordance with the protocols which determine when to refer the client to the pharmacist.46S u m m a r y of Evidence 3339McEnlay JC and Dickson FC, \"Purchases from community pharmacies of Pharm J 253(1994) Pugh \"Public views on an extended role for community pharmacy\", Int J Pharm Pract1(1992) 223-9. 41Dowell J and Dodd T, \"Repeat dispensing by community pharmacists: a popular way to resource document and guide for the New NHS .

Such collaboration has been shown to reduce inappropriate multiple medication.47,48Apilot repeat dispensing project in Tayside showed that 90% of patients preferred the pharmacy-based system and that clinical review was improved.49 Pharmacists may also be involved in running specific outpatient clinics. Examples include anti-coagulant clinics,50Helicobacter pylori eradication,51hypertension,52 asthma,53and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.54 iiiUse of resources - there is evidence that consultations with pharmacists about OTC medicines reduce referrals to GPs,55and that the administrative workload of doctors may be reduced by community pharmacies'repeat dispensing services.56 Pharmaceutical advisers can help improve budgetary control57and cost-effective prescribing in general practice.58In the USA, financial savings have been identified through the reduction in inappropriate prescribing following advice from pharmacists. Prescribing by other health professionals 5.13There is very little available information about prescribing by other professionals. In Sweden, some other professions including dental hygienists may prescribe from a limited formulary .Review of Prescribing, Supply & Administration of Medicines - Final Report 3447Hulme H, Wilson J, Burrill, Goldstein R, \"Rational repeat prescribing: general practitioners control trial of a clinical pharmacist intervention to improve inappropriate prescribing in elderly outpatients with polypharmacy\" American J of Medicine 100(1996) 428-37. 49Dowell J, Cruikshank J, Bain J and Staines H, \"Repeat dispensing by community pharmacists: advantages for patients and practitioners\", British Journal of General Practice 48 (1998) 1858-1859. 50Radley AS, Hall J, Farrow M and Carey PJ, \"Evaluation of anticoagulant programme in general practice\", Pharm J R5. 52Erickson SR, Slaughter R and asthma management program department visits\", The Annals of Pharmacotherapy 29(1995) 5-9. 54Pharmaceutical Care Awards 1997 - Achronic obstructive pulmonary disease clinic.

This chapter is largely concerned with prescribing. However, a later section (paras 6.55-6.62) considers some issues at the interface between prescribing, supply and administration. 6.3Except where otherwise indicated or implied by the context, we use the term \"prescribe\" to refer to the ordering of a prescription only medicine (ie sense (i) as defined in our Glossary). However, much of the content of the chapter applies equally to the broader definition (sense (ii)), which is any written order for a medicine and includes authorisation to supply a prescription only medicine and to supply at NHS expense. The detailed implications for medicines and NHS legislation respectively are considered in Chapter 8. Extension of prescribing to new professional groups 6.4The Review Team believes that many aspects of the existing arrangements for the treatment of patients should be retained. In particular, it believes that ithe co-ordination of patient care should normally rest with the general practitioner or , during episodes of hospital care, with a named consultant; iiin the great majority of cases, medicines should be prescribed and dispensed on an individual, patient-specific basis; iiipatient safety should not in any way be compromised; ivthe provision of medicines to patients should make the best use of professional expertise and the most effective use of resources. 6.5However, having reviewed all the information available to them in the light of their own professional knowledge and experience, the members of the Review Team unanimously recommend that the legal authority to prescribe in the United Kingdom, or to authorise supply at NHS expense, should be extended beyond currently authorised prescribers.P roposed Policy Framework for Extension of Pr e s c r i b i n g 356.6The main factors which have led us to this conclusion are igrowing expertise in advanced clinical roles in many professions (see paras 3.4-3.5), which means that other professional groups have specific skills in particular therapeutic areas; iian increasing tendency for professionals to work together in multi-professional teams in which the precise boundaries of clinical responsibility can vary both over time and with the competencies of the individual professionals involved; iiithe need for the responsibility and accountability for clinical care to be clear and unambiguous; iva growing expectation from patients that they will experience a \"seamless service\" with the minimum number of contacts with different health professionals consistent with patient safety; va growing wish on the part of patients to choose the particular pathway through the clinical system which is convenient or appropriate to them, in cases where there are equally safe and effective clinical alternatives. Recommendation 1: The legal authority in the United Kingdom to prescribe, including authorising NHS expenditure, should be extended beyond currently authorised prescribers. Limitations on the range of medicines which can be prescribed 6.7The Review Team has considered the broad spectrum of opinions which were put forward through the consultation process about the range of medicines which should be available to new prescribers. 6 . 8Some respondents argued that any health professionals who have received appropriate training and are authorised to prescribe should be expected to understand the limits of their competence and act within them. On this basis, new prescribers could, like doctors and dentists at present, be legally entitled to prescribe the majority of licensed products, on the understanding that they would in practice prescribe only within the limits of their competence. Any practitioner prescribing outside these limits would be acting unprofessionally, and the relevant regulatory body would be expected to take action. The Review Team considers that such a wide extension of prescribing authority is not necessary to achieve benefits in patient care. 6.9Others argued that prescription only medicines (POMs) are so designated in order to protect the public, and that only practitioners with broad and extensive training and experience in both diagnostics and therapeutics, such as doctors and dentists, can prescribe them safely. T h i s a rgument would lead to the conclusion that any new prescribers should be limited to P and GSL medicines. The Review Team considers that such a narrow view is unnecessary for patientReview of Prescribing, Supply & Administration of Medicines - Final Report 36s a f e t y, restricts the contribution that skilled professionals could make to improvements in patient care, and fails to build on the experience of modern approaches to the delivery of care. 6.10The Review Team concludes that new prescribers will normally be working within specific therapeutic areas and will need access to a limited range of medicines, which in most cases will include some POMs. One possible exception is for pharmacists continuing treatment initiated by another prescriber, which might relate to a wider range of conditions (see para 6.18). Prescribers will however be expected to be familiar with the implications of multiple pathology and co-morbidity .These should be addressed in their training as important aspects of competence to prescribe. Recommendation 2: Legal authority for new professional groups to prescribe or to authorise NHS expenditure should normally be limited to medicines in specific therapeutic areas related to the particular competence and expertise of the group and may include prescription only medicines within those areas. 6.11It is possible that some professionals may gain additional qualifications in two or more specialist areas within their profession, all of which confer prescribing authority .This would be acceptable provided the individual is able to fulfil the requirements for updating skills, clinical audit etc for allareas of specialisation. Independent and dependent prescribing 6.12The act of prescribing a medicine is part of a process which starts with the overall clinical assessment of an individual who presents for preventive care or for treatment. In the case of a patient, the assessment should result in a clinical opinion about the management of the condition which may or may not include the establishment of a full diagnosis. The management of the patient may include prescribing medicine. The initiation of care and the development of a treatment plan must take into account all relevant aspects of the patient' s condition, and requires knowledge of the implications of any co-existing medical conditions and possible interactions with existing medication. 6.13The Review Team believes that, although assessment and prescribing should form part of a single process,it is not always essential that both should be part of a single consultation with one professional. The Team therefore proposes that two categories of prescribing should be defined, \"independent\" and \"dependent\" prescribing. Independent prescribing 6.14The Review Team defines the act of prescribing for a patient presenting for the first time in an episode of care as \"independent pr e s c r i b i n g \" . This means that the prescriber takes responsibility for the clinical assessment of the patient (usually including establishing a diagnosis) as well as for the appropriateness of any prescription which may be issued at that time.P roposed Policy Framework for Extension of Pr e s c r i b i n g 376.15The Team believes that doctors and dentists will continue to form the majority of independent prescribers for POMs. Any extensions, beyond district nurses and health visitors who are already legally entitled to prescribe from a limited list of medicines, are likely to be limited to specific therapeutic areas. Dependent Prescribing 6.16Once a diagnosis has been established or a treatment plan prepared for an individual patient, the responsibility for clinical management may be transferred from the assessing clinician (an independent prescriber) to another health professional. In this situation, the prescribing of medicines by the second clinician is defined by the Review Team as \"dependent prescribing\".59This means that the dependent prescriber is not responsible for the initial assessment or diagnosis, which rests with the assessing clinician. 6.17The dependent prescriber is responsible for the appropriateness of any prescription which he or she may issue. This may include an initial prescription for a particular episode of care, if the independent prescriber has not inaugurated pharmaceutical treatment, together with any related clinical assessments. The Team envisages that dependent prescribing will usually be informed by clinical guidelines, and will be consistent with individual treatment plans. 6.18 Aparticular form of dependent prescribing occurs when a second professional (for instance, a pharmacist or a nurse) continues a course of pharmaceutical treatment after an initial prescription by the assessing clinician (independent prescriber). It differs from repeat dispensing (see para 6.63) in that the dependent prescriber would have the discretion to vary some aspects of the prescription, such as dose, frequency, presentation, or active ingredient group, within the individual treatment plan specified by the assessing clinician. The dependent prescriber would remain responsible for ensuring that a further prescription was both needed and clinically appropriate. There should be provision for regular clinical review by the assessing clinician. 6.19In any form of dependent prescribing, good communication between the two clinicians is essential. In particular, it is of vital importance that both clinicians have access to a complete medication record, and that the dependent prescriber has access to a summary of the patient' s medical record. This could be secured through the more extensive use of information technology (IT), or, as an interim measure, through the use of hand-held patient records. This is discussed further at para 8.19.Review of Prescribing, Supply & Administration of Medicines - Final Report 3859Note that we are using \"dependent prescribing\" in a rather different sense from the report of the New Zealand working party cited in footnote 22 on page 29, in which dependent prescribers assess the patient and recommend the course of treatment, but must have any prescription signed by an authorised prescriber .Recommendation 3: Two types of prescriber should be recognised: ithe independent pr escriberwho is responsible for the assessment of patients with undiagnosed conditions and for decisions about the clinical management required, including prescribing. At present, doctors, dentists and certain nurses in respect of a limited list of medicines are legally authorised prescribers who fulfil the requirements for independent prescribers and this should continue. Certain other health professionals may also become newly legally authorised independent prescribers, subject to the process described below . ii the dependent pr escriberwho is responsible for the continuing care of patients who have been clinically assessed by an independent prescriber. This continuing care may include prescribing, which will usually be informed by clinical guidelines and will be consistent with individual treatment plans; or continuing established treatments by issuing repeat prescriptions, with the authority to adjust the dose or dosage form according to the patients' needs. There should be provision for regular clinical review by the assessing clinician. Recommendation 4: There should be adequate arrangements for sharing information between independent and dependent prescribers. In particular , iboth clinicians should have access to a complete medication record, and iiboth clinicians should have access to relevant parts of the patient's medical record. 6.20 Examples of the groups of professionals who might reasonably make early application to be given the legal authority to prescribe, and therapeutic areas in which they would have prescribing authority, are given at paras 6.38-6.39. Dependent prescribing vs supply and administration under group protocol 6.21There are some similarities between the concept of \"dependent prescribing\", as we have defined it above, and the concept of supply or administration under group protocol, the subject of our first report. In both cases, a second professional would be required to assess the health care need of the individual patient, and provide appropriate treatment within a general care plan drawn up by another professional (usually a doctor) or team. There are, however, some important distinctions: ithe dependent prescriber would be working within a care plan drawn up for the individual patient, following a full clinical assessment by the assessing clinician; while supply and administration under group protocols is intended mainly to deal with groupsP roposed Policy Framework for Extension of Pr e s c r i b i n g 39of patients who may not be individually identified before presentation for treatment, and where either there is an urgent need to initiate treatment, for example in intensive care, or where there is a low risk of interaction with other conditions or medicines; iithe dependent prescriber would have much greater discretion over the choice of the treatment regime, including the possible choice of medicines, than the professional supplying medicines under group protocol, whose discretion is likely to be limited to the exact specification of the protocol. 6.22It is difficult to predict which model is likely to be more appropriate in particular clinical circumstances. Administration or supply within group protocol may be a suitable model where patients' clinical needs are broadly similar and individual prescriptions would be unwieldy or impracticable (as in mass vaccination campaigns), or where there is a need for urgent treatment (as in relief of acute asthma attacks by ambulance paramedics). Dependent or independent prescribing will be preferable where more detailed clinical assessment is needed and the range of treatment options required to meet the clinical needs of the patients is wider (as in family planning clinics). The Review Team does not expect administration or supply under group protocol to be widely adopted in circumstances which do not fully meet the criteria set out in the first report, simply because this appears to be an easier option than applying for authority to prescribe through the mechanisms proposed in this report. Patient choice and patient consent 6.23If the recommendations in our two reports are adopted, a number of new models will become available for organising clinical care, including the prescribing and supply of medicines. We think that it is vital that any changes in the pattern of local service delivery should be introduced only after full consultation with patient interests, and wherever possible in such a way as to increase rather than reduce patient choice. Within the NHS Health Authorities,60 Trusts and Primary Care Groups61will need to consider carefully the best way of consulting patients on proposed changes. Community Health Councils62are likely to have an important part to play, as may local branches of national patient groups.Review of Prescribing, Supply & Administration of Medicines - Final Report 4060Health Boards in Scotland, Health and Personal Social Services Boards in Northern Ireland. 61Local Health Care Co-operatives in Scotland, Local Health Groups in Wales [no equivalent has been established in Northern Ireland as yet]. 62Health Councils in Scotland.Recommendation 5: Changes to patterns of clinical care using new models for the prescribing, supply and administration of medicines should be introduced only after full consultation with patient interests, and should wherever possible increase patient choice. Proposed process for approving new prescribers 6.24The Review Team considers that the first stage in any extension of prescribing should be the assessment of the case for a specific professional group. Following approval of the group, individual members of the profession would be entitled to undergo training leading to registration as authorised prescribers. The stages would therefore be: iapproval of professional group - an appropriate professional organisation,63acting on behalf of a defined professional group, would put forward an application to ministers64 for suitably trained professionals within the group to be eligible to apply for the authority to prescribe in a defined therapeutic area; iiapproval of individual practitioners - individual professionals within an approved group would undertake additional training and would then apply to the profession's regulatory body, under criteria to be agreed as part of stage (i), for inclusion in the register of approved prescribers. The steps involved in the two stages are summarised in Diagrams 1 and 2, on pages 47 and 54. Proposed arrangements for the extension of prescribing to new professional groups Advice to Government 6.25The Review Team has considered the possible mechanisms for advising Government on applications from professional groups. P roposed Policy Framework for Extension of Pr e s c r i b i n g 4163This could be the national regulatory body, or the national body responsible for setting educational standards, or a recognised body representing the interests of a particular group within the profession. 64When the devolution acts come into force, responsibility for certain NHS issues will be devolved. Depending on the precise context, \"ministers\" for the purpose of this report may encompass ministers of the Crown and some or all of ministers of the Scottish Parliament, ministers of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the executive of the Welsh Assembly .The main options are: i Asub-committee of one of the existing Medicines Act committees, ie either the Medicines Commission or the Committee on Safety of Medicines (see para 2.12 -2.15). The benefits of this option are vit would in some ways be a logical extension of the advisory functions of the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) or the Medicines Commission; vit would make effective use of the expertise in the Medicines Control Agency (MCA) which provides the secretariat for both the CSM and the Medicines Commission; vthe CSM would in any case need to be consulted on the specific medicines which new prescribers could safely prescribe (see below). There are however some difficulties which, in the view of the Team, would make this option undesirable: vone of the major criteria for assessing applications (see below) would be the adequacy of the proposed arrangements for training, updating of skills and audit. None of the existing Medicines Act bodies are, at present, constituted in such a way as to ensure expertise in these areas; veven if a sub-committee with appropriate skills and expertise were assembled, the fact that it was formally answerable to a committee without this expertise might undermine its credibility with those professional groups which would be making applications; vthe current role of both the Medicines Commission65and of the CSM is in practice largely confined to advising on the issues covered by the Medicines Act itself, ie the safety and efficacy of licensed medicines and the use of medicines whether inside or outside the NHS. iia joint committee of the regulatory and other professional bodies (General Medical Council, General Dental Council, Medical Royal Colleges and Faculties, UKCC, RPSGB etc) . This option would bring together much of the necessary expertise for the judgements to be made. It has three major drawbacks:Review of Prescribing, Supply & Administration of Medicines - Final Report 4265In law, the Medicines Commission may advise on any aspect of the use of medicines, whether or not covered by the Medicines Act. We understand however that it would be unusual for the Department to seek the advice of the Commission on issues such as whether medicines should be prescribable at NHS expense.vit lacks independence. Applications for extended prescribing authority would in most cases be coming from bodies which, directly or indirectly, form the joint committee, so their representatives would be put in the invidious position of \"judge and jury\"; varrangements would have to be made for the inclusion of other important groups, such as patient representatives, NHS commissioners, and NHS provider management; vthere may be occasions when the interests of one or more of the constituent bodies might be affected by the proposals under consideration, thus undermining the independence and impartiality of the process. iiia new body independent both of existing Medicines Act committees and of the professional bodies . This option has several advantages: vit would be able to offer independent and impartial advice to ministers; vmembers would be chosen on the basis of their personal expertise, and would not represent particular interests or organisations; vthe terms of reference could make clear that the body was expected to conduct its work and express its opinions openly, without reference to a parent body. It could be required to publish both the general criteria by which applications would be judged and the reasons for particular advice; vit would be able to advise ministers on whether prescribing by new groups should be eligible for public funding through the NHS. 6.26On balance, therefore, the Review Team favours option (iii). The team considers that there could be advantages in setting up such a committee as a statutory committee under Section 4 of the Medicines Act (see para 2.13 and Annex D), although it understands that this would require some amendment to primary legislation if this committee were to advise ministers on cost-effectiveness. Whatever the legislative basis, it would be important to ensure that the new committee could be asked to advise on all aspects of proposals for new groups of prescribers. Although established under the Medicines Act, the new committee would not be directly answerable to the Medicines Commission or the CSM. 6.27Since medicines legislation applies across the UK, the Team considers that the remit of the new body should similarly be UK-wide. P roposed Policy Framework for Extension of Pr e s c r i b i n g 43Recommendation 6: AUK-wide advisory body, provisionally entitled the \"New Prescribers Advisory Committee\", should be established under Section 4 of the Medicines Act to assess submissions from professional organisations seeking powers for suitably trained members to become independent or dependent prescribers. For the remainder of this report, we refer to the proposed new body as the \"New Prescribers Advisory Committee\" (NPAC). The proposed functions and responsibilities of NPAC are described below and a possible outline process for dealing with submissions is set out in Diagram 1. 6.28The team proposes that the NPAC should promulgate clear criteria for extensions to prescribing, and should advise on the following aspects of individual applications: vthe clinical need for the proposed extension of prescribing; vthe definition and registration arrangements of the professional group concerned, ensuring that there are clear criteria for determining which individuals may be included in the group. This may include consideration of the education and training requirements for the group; vthe need for additional prescribing to be \"independent\" or \"dependent\" in the sense defined above; vthe broad category(ies) of medicines that might be prescribed; vthe need for prescribing by the new group to be funded by the NHS. 6.29If ministers approved a recommendation from NPAC that an application from a particular professional group should be accepted, the proposal would pass to the CSM, for advice on which specific POMs (if any) members of the group could safely prescribe, and to the Joint Formulary Committee of the British National Formulary for advice on which P and GSL medicines could be prescribed at NHS expense. The Medicines Commission might wish to comment on the process as a whole, though it would not necessarily need to advise on each separate application.Review of Prescribing, Supply & Administration of Medicines - Final Report 44Diagram 1 P roposed Policy Framework for Extension of Pr e s c r i b i n g 45 6.30Possible terms of reference for the NPAC are set out in the box below . Suggested terms of reference for the New Prescribers Advisory Committee \"To advise ministers on the extension of prescribing authority to health professions; and in particular ito establish criteria for the inclusion of professional groups on the list of professions whose members may, subject to successful completion of additional training, become authorised independent or dependent prescribers; iito assess applications from professional groups for inclusion in the list of authorised independent or dependent prescribers, taking into account vthe clinical need for the proposed extension of prescribing authority; vthe definition of the professional group and the arrangements for initial and continuing education and training, assessment and registration; iiito form an initial assessment as to the range of medicines which professional groups might prescribe, and the arrangements which would be required for training in prescribing; ivto assess any implications for the supply of medicines, and in particular , where the proposals could result in a professional prescribing and supplying POMs to the same patient, to advise on any safeguards needed to maintain patient safety and ensure probity;66 vto advise whether prescribing by the new group should be eligible for public funding through the NHS; vito keep these arrangements under review.\" Review of Prescribing, Supply & Administration of Medicines - Final Report 4666See paras 6.56-6.59 for further discussion of this aspect.Composition of the New Prescribers Advisory Committee 6.31The members of the NPAC should be chosen for their personal expertise, and not as representatives of any particular interest or body. Nevertheless, a wide range of perspectives will be needed. These include: icurrent prescribers ii other relevant health care professions iiiprofessional regulatory bodies iv education and training accrediting bodies (currently the National Boards for Nursing, Midwifery and Health Visiting; the Medical Royal Colleges and Faculties; the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain; and the professional Boards of the Council for Professions Supplementary to Medicine) vNHS commissioners and provider units vi patient groups with perhaps an observer from the Medicines Commission. The composition of the body would need to reflect its UK-wide responsibilities. In order to maintain its independence, members should be appointed by health ministers, after consultation with relevant organisations. 6.32The Review Team recognises that ministers will wish to consider further whether the new advisory committee should be established on a statutory or non-statutory basis. Whatever its status, the Team would expect its recommendations to be communicated clearly to the public and to the professions concerned, and to be in the public domain. Arrangements for applications Source of Applications 6.33Applications for prescribing authority would be made on behalf of health professions or specific groups within major professions, such as nurses specialising in asthma care or family planning, or pharmacists specialising in advising patients on discharge medication or in anti- coagulation treatment. Submissions could be made either by a national body representing the interests of the profession as a whole, or by a specialty association. In the latter case the association should indicate whether or not the proposal is supported by the main national body(ies). In every case, the professional organisation putting forward the submission will need to confirm that the group is defined by completion of an accredited training programme leading to a specialist qualification which is formally recognised by the appropriate regulatory body. In addition, evidence will be required that the regulatory body has been consulted andP roposed Policy Framework for Extension of Pr e s c r i b i n g 47is content with the proposals for assessing and registering or recording any further training required for prescribers. Recommendation 7: Proposals for new professional groups to be considered as potential prescribers will be expected to come from nationally recognised organisations. They should confirm that the group is formally recognised by the appropriate regulatory body and that that body has seen and is content with the proposed arrangements for training in prescribing and for registration. Criteria for applications 6.34It would be for the new body to determine the precise criteria for assessing applications from professional groups to become independent or dependent prescribers. The Review Team suggests that the criteria might be based on the following questions: iWhat clinical benefits are expected to be derived from the proposed extension of the authority to prescribe? Could these benefits be secured in a different way, for example through use of supply or administration under group protocol, or through amendments to the POM Order, by removing the prescription only status of particular medicines?67 iiWhat impact would the change have on patient convenience and patient choice? iiiDoes the proposed process ensure that only professionals with appropriate specialist qualifications, recorded or registered with the appropriate professional regulatory body , would be allowed to apply for prescribing authority? ivAre there adequate arrangements for ensuring that all new prescribers will: vundergo satisfactory training in all relevant aspects of prescribing? vundertake regular continuing professional development related to their prescribing, approved by the appropriate professional body? vparticipate in professional audit or other quality assurance activities? vWhat would be the benefits from allowing prescribing at public expense, and are these sufficient to justify any additional costs which might be incurred?Review of Prescribing, Supply & Administration of Medicines - Final Report 4867Amendments to the POM Order are made on the advice of the CSM. The initiative in seeking amendments usually comes from pharmaceutical companies, but there is no reason why proposals should not also be put forward by professional groups.Content of applications 6.35The Review Team would therefore expect each professional group to demonstrate to the new body that: vpatient care and/or patient convenience would be improved if all or some of its members were to become authorised prescribers; vits members are fully qualified professionals registered with a recognised regulatory body; vsuccessful completion of any additional training required to practice in the specialist area relevant to the proposed prescribing would be accredited and registered or recorded with a recognised regulatory body; vits members would have access to approved training programmes for prescribing, and for any additional clinical skills required to ensure safe and appropriate prescribing; vthere would be adequate arrangements for assessing the competence of members who had completed training; and for ensuring that all members (including where relevant those intending to work outside the NHS) participate in clinical audit and in continuing professional development relevant to prescribing skills. Submissions should clearly indicate whether the proposal is for independent or dependent prescribing authority, and (in broad terms) what medicines or groups of medicines might be prescribed. Monitoring and updating the new arrangements 6.36As clinical practice develops, the conditions which applied when the NPAC first considered the application for a particular professional group may change. In general, the responsibility will lie with professional organisations and professional regulatory bodies to keep under review the training requirements and other safeguards for new prescribers, to exploit new opportunities to improve services and to ensure that patient safety is at all times preserved (see Chapter 8). However, the NPAC may itself need on occasion to take the initiative by requiring professional groups to submit evidence to show that prescribing by a particular group is still safe and effective. 6.37 The Review Team also expects that the range of medicines available to the newly authorised groups of prescribers will need to be reviewed regularly to ensure that up-to-date clinical practice can be maintained. Proposals for changes relating to NHS prescription of P or GSL medicines could be considered by an appropriate sub-committee of the British National Formulary's Joint Formulary Committee (see para 6.29). Proposals to vary the range of POMs which a particular group could prescribe would need to go to the CSM, which is responsible for advising ministers on any changes to the POM Order (see para 2.14).P roposed Policy Framework for Extension of Pr e s c r i b i n g 49Possible early candidates for prescribing authority 6.38The Team was asked to develop a generalframework for any possible extension of prescribing authority, rather than to recommend extension to any particular professional groups. Nevertheless, in the course of our work we considered a variety of circumstances in which extended prescribing might, subject to proper safeguards, lead to better patient care. Those with the strongest support are where: iprescribing is limited to the choice between a relatively small range of medicines in which the prescriber can be expected to develop a considerable degree of expertise; iiclinical assessment is within a fairly narrow range of possibilities, either because patients are seeking specific care or because they have already been assessed by another clinician. Prescribers must, however, be aware of unusual presentations or possible contraindications which would require referral back to the clinician with overall responsibility for the patient's care. 6.39The following illustrative examples suggest a number of professional groups which may wish to consider applying at an early stage for the authority to prescribe medicines (including where appropriate prescribing POMs and incurring NHS expenditure). This list is not exclusive. Independent prescribers iFamily planning nurses . Nurses in family planning clinics are very often patients' f i r s t contact with the health care system, and the relative ease and informality of access is an important strength in this service. This is a typical example of prescribing in a specialised area, from a relatively limited list of products, by highly trained practitioners. iiTissue viability nurses . Nurses with special expertise are often asked to assess the viability of a patient's skin, typically in the patient's own home. Adiagnosis is established and treatment started immediately .As independent prescribers, tissue viability nurses would be able not only to prescribe themselves, but also to develop a care plan for a dependent prescriber to follow . iiiChiropodists and podiatrists. Specialist podiatrists undertake some forms of foot surgery.Although they are currently able to supply a limited range of medicines, a small expansion of the list, and the ability to prescribe as well as supply, would enhance significantly the care they could give to patients. ivSpecialist physiotherapists (also known as extended scope practitioners). Specialist physiotherapists now work independently in outpatient clinics assessing, diagnosing, and taking sole management responsibility for patients. They can already order investigations, and refer on to other specialists. Prescribing would entail the use of a small range of medicines including analgesics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication, for both oral use and for injection.Review of Prescribing, Supply & Administration of Medicines - Final Report 50vOptometrists. Optometrists'expertise relating to the eye and visual system, coupled with the use of specialised diagnostic instruments, is the basis of the care they provide in the community, including domiciliary visits. Having established a diagnosis, prescribing would allow them to provide effective treatment for emergency eye conditions and non-sight-threatening eye conditions. Dependent prescribers viSpecialist diabetes nurses . Diabetes nurses are already skilled in advising patients with diabetes, training them in the use of insulin or other therapies, and assessing and changing the dose required. Typically, a newly presenting patient is seen in the first instance by a hospital specialist who establishes a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. If diabetes nurses were approved as dependant prescribers they could take over clinical responsibility at this point, assess the precise requirement for insulin or other medicines, prescribe as needed, and supervise continuing treatment, referring back to the doctor as necessary . viiSpecialist asthma nurses . Patients who have been diagnosed as suffering from asthma by a doctor could be followed up by an asthma nurse. The nurse would undertake a clinical review, including an assessment of the patient's respiratory function. Within the framework of the patient's care plan the nurse would be able to vary the treatment and prescribe further medication as required. viiiSpecialist palliative care nurses. Palliative care nurses work closely with medical and nursing colleagues in hospitals and in the community, and have particular expertise in symptom control and the management of pain. Typically, a patient would be seen by a hospital specialist or GP (the independent prescriber). Responsibility would then pass to the palliative care nurse who would, if a dependent prescriber, be able to review and revise medication, within the overall care plan. ixPharmacists in specialist areas , such as oncology, asthma or diabetes clinics. Pharmacists would bring wide experience and knowledge of clinical pharmacy and pharmacology, including potential drug and food interactions, as well as specialist knowledge of the particular clinical area. Pharmacists already interpret the results of drug monitoring, undertake assessments, titrate therapy and counsel patients, but currently require any prescriptions to be signed by a doctor . xPharmacists carrying out reviews of patients' medication, eg patients on multiple therapy. Pharmacists in primary care already have extensive experience of medication reviews,68where they are able to alert the GP prescriber to possible drug interactions or to changes in the patient's condition. This often leads to a proposal for alternative and more appropriate drug choices. As dependent prescribers, pharmacists could be givenP roposed Policy Framework for Extension of Pr e s c r i b i n g 518National Prescribing Centre and NHS Executive. GPPrescribing Support: a resource document and guide for the New NHS . September 1998.limited discretion to vary treatment on their own initiative, within limits agreed with the independent prescriber. Clear arrangements for such joint working would need to be developed, and should include mechanisms to ensure that the GP is informed as soon as practicable of any change in treatment and that the patient is given clear advice and written information about any variations in treatment. Proposed arrangements for the authorisation of individual practitioners as prescribers 6.40The Review Team envisages that individual practitioners who are fully qualified members of professional groups which have been approved for prescribing would become authorised prescribers by a process which is outlined in Diagram 2. Diagram 2 Review of Prescribing, Supply & Administration of Medicines - Final Report 52 6.41At the present time, such practitioners will have to undertake an approved training programme for prescribing. In the future, training for prescribing may be incorporated into other professional training programmes. If this occurs, these arrangements would have to be suitably modified. 6.42The Review Team considers that there would be advantages in developing training programmes for prescribing which consist of a core of topics which would be required by candidates from all professional backgrounds, together with specific modules related to the clinical specialities and medicinal products relevant to individual groups. Such arrangements would foster multidisciplinary learning and make best use of the educational resources available for prescribing training. All training programmes should include a period of supervised practice. 6.43An individual who wished to become an authorised prescriber would be required to demonstrate to the body responsible for the approved training programme that s/he was a fully qualified and registered member of a professional group which had been approved to prescribe. Anyone not able to provide such evidence would not be accepted on a course. 6.44On completion of the course and following assessment of the skills attained, successful candidates would be able to apply to the relevant regulatory body for inclusion on the list of authorised prescribers. Unsuccessful candidates would be required to retake all or part of the course. The relevant professional bodies should give consideration to the number of resits that should be allowed. 6.45When duly registered, prescribers should be required to complete an approved continuing professional development programme relevant to their prescribing responsibilities. The professional and regulatory bodies should determine the frequency of re-registration as a prescriber, the criteria for successful completion of continuing professional development programmes and the number of attempts allowed, subject to approval by NPAC. 6.46The arrangements proposed above would apply to professional practice in any sector. For those professionals working in the NHS, in groups which have been recommended by NPAC and approved by Government as authorised NHS prescribers, an additional step is required. 6.47Within the NHS, changes in the content of jobs to include undertaking prescribing responsibilities must be approved by the employer69within locally agreed patterns of health care provision. The authority to prescribe may be a requirement in the job description for some posts in the future. Arrangements will be required for approved NHS prescribers to be issued with NHS prescription pads and for other administrative procedures to be established.P roposed Policy Framework for Extension of Pr e s c r i b i n g 5369Or, in the case of a PMS pilot scheme (see Annex D) led by the professionals seeking to prescribe, by the health authority in contract with the pilot practice.Particular prescribing issues Pre-registration house officers in general practice placements 6.48Pre-registration house officers (PRHOs) are doctors who have successfully completed undergraduate medical training and are provisionally registered with the GMC. They undergo a further year of supervised general clinical training (the \"PRHO year\"), usually in a hospital setting, before they can be fully registered. PRHOs are not currently expected to issue prescriptions, although in the hospital setting they will be expected to make entries on medicine charts either under the supervision of a fully registered doctor or, exceptionally, on their own initiative. 6.49PRHOs may now spend part of their 12-month training on a clinical placement in general practice. It has been suggested that PRHOs in general practice might be given the authority to prescribe not only under direct supervision but, when their supervisor considers they are ready to do so, on their own responsibility, as a stepping-stone towards the further responsibilities they will have as fully registered doctors. 6.50In considering these issues, the Team has had regard to three factors: ithe need to expose PRHOs to an increasing level of responsibility; iithe need to preserve the principle that PRHOs, whilst making a service contribution, are progressively developing their skills under supervision as part of their educative process; iiithe overriding need to protect patient safety . 6.51We believe that PRHOs have sufficient education in clinical diagnosis and in clinical pharmacology and therapeutics, both theoretical and practical, to be able to develop their experience and training by prescribing within the supervised environment of the pre- registration year .We therefore recommend that the GMC agrees with postgraduate deans a safe framework within which this could take place. This framework, which should apply equally to approved PRHO placements in all clinical sectors, would allow PRHOs at the discretion of their supervising clinician to prescribe all appropriate medicines relevant to the duties of their post. This prescribing should be subject to close monitoring by their supervisor , with due regard to the proper discharge of supervisory responsibility as specified in para 8.8 and Recommendation 21.Review of Prescribing, Supply & Administration of Medicines - Final Report 54Recommendation 8: The GMC and postgraduate deans should agree a safe framework within which pre- registration house officers (PRHOs) could prescribe medicines relevant to the duties of their post. Such prescribing should be subject to close monitoring by their clinical supervisor, with due regard to the proper discharge of supervisory responsibility as specified in Recommendation 21. Newly-arrived overseas doctors and dentists 6.52Most overseas doctors and dentists come to the UK for postgraduate medical education with sufficient clinical experience to be accepted from the outset as authorised prescribers. In some cases, overseas doctors need to requalify via the primary qualifying diplomas of the United Examining Board. In these circumstances, they would be given provisional registration and would need to undertake a clinical placement analogous to a UK PRHO. The considerations in such cases are exactly parallel to those discussed in the previous section. Recommendation 9: Overseas doctors given provisional registration by the GMC and required to undertake clinical training similar to that of a PRHO, and overseas dentists, given temporary registration by the GDC to practice in an approved training post in a NHS hospital, should be able to prescribe under similar safeguards to those described in Recommendation 8. Medicines which should not normally be available to new groups of prescribers 6.53Anumber of groups of medicines should, for a variety of reasons, not normally be available to new groups of prescribers. Examples include: icontrolled drugs which are subject to the special provisions of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (see Annex D paras 23-27); iiunlicensed drugs or drugs used outside their licensed indications , including drugs undergoing pre-licensing clinical trials, and certain medicines which are commonly used for children but have never been licensed for paediatric use; iii\"black triangle\" drugs , which are newly-introduced drugs, still subject to special monitoring for potential side-effects by the MCA (so called because they are identified by a black triangle symbol in the British National Formulary); ivdrugs over which there is continuing professional concern , for instance drugs used to treat children and young people with mental health problems; vdrugs which on public health grounds should be subject to particular care, for instance antibacterial antibiotics.P roposed Policy Framework for Extension of Pr e s c r i b i n g 556.54Where, exceptionally, a group of new prescribers can demonstrate a good clinical case for prescribing antibacterials or other antibiotics, it is expected that this would be for a very limited range of drugs and for very clearly defined clinical indications, and subject to the safeguards advocated in the recent reports from the Standing Medical Advisory Committee70 and the House of Lords Science and Technology Committee.71 Recommendation 10: Newly authorised groups of prescribers should not normally be allowed to prescribe medicines in the following categories: icontrolled drugs (drugs subject to the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971); iiunlicensed drugs or drugs used outside their licensed indications; iii\"black triangle\" drugs; ivdrugs over which there is continuing professional concern, eg drugs used to treat children and young people with mental health problems; vdrugs which on public health grounds should be subject to particular safeguards, for instance antibacterial antibiotics. Implications for the sale, supply and administration of medicines 6.55This section considers the relationship between the recommendations in this report for possible extension of the authority to prescribe, and arrangements for the sale, supply and administration of medicines. It is concerned with the supply of medicines to individual patients, as opposed to groups of patients, which was the subject of this Review's first report (see para 1.3 and Annex C). Sale and supply of medicines 6.56Many of the submissions to the Review Team supported, as a general rule, the continued separation of the prescribing and supply of medicines in respect of the same patient.Review of Prescribing, Supply & Administration of Medicines - Final Report 5670The path of least resistance: A report by the Standing Medical Advisory Committee Sub-Group on Antimicrobial Resistance (Department of Health, London, 1998). 71House of Lords Science and Technology Committee. Resistance to antibiotics and other antimicrobial agents: seventh report from the Science and Technology Committee: Session 1997-98 (London: Stationery Office, 1998 (HL81; Vol 1)).6.57The separation of these actions provides two important safeguards: iit provides a check on the accuracy of the prescribing decision. It enables a second health professional (usually a pharmacist) to apply further professional skills and knowledge before the medicine is supplied. It also gives the patient or carer a further opportunity to discuss the medication and its use; iiin the context of NHS reimbursement, it provides a safeguard against fraud and abuse. 6.58The Review Team considered whether these reasons for the separation of prescribing and supply continue to be valid, in particular in the case of dependent prescribing where a second professional is already involved. On balance, we concluded that iseparation of prescribing and supply should in the case of initial prescribing still be regarded as the ideal, both for reasons of patient safety and for probity; iithere might however be circumstances in which the traditional separation might not be in the patient's best interest. Each case would need to be considered on its merits, on a prudent assessment of the risks and benefits of any relaxation. Such cases might for instance include, in addition to the long-standing arrangements for dispensing by doctors in rural areas and by dentists where immediately continuing treatment is necessary, the following: vthe need for emergency supply of medicines, to the extent that this is not already covered by the current provision for the emergency sale or supply of medicines by pharmacists;72 vinstances in which a pharmacist authorised as a dependent prescriber amends a prescription by correcting obvious errors in dosage, nomenclature etc as part of the dispensing process;73 vsale of Pand GSL medicines, where it is already lawful and common practice for pharmacists to advise patients on the possible choice of medicines (\"prescribe\" in sense (iii) of the Glossary) before supplying the chosen product; iiiany exceptions to the general principle, in particular for POM medicines and for medicines supplied at NHS expense, should be subject to clinical and probity audit, to minimise any risks to patient safety or scope for abuse. The Team also expects that pharmacists will continue to supply the vast majority of medicines.P roposed Policy Framework for Extension of Pr e s c r i b i n g 5772Article 8 of the POM Order 1997. 73As a matter of good professional practice the dependent prescriber would be expected either to consult the independent prescriber in advance, or to notify the changes made as soon as possible afterwards.6.59The Team recognises that some professional groups which currently have the authority to sell or supply certain medicines in the course of treatment may apply for new powers to prescribe those medicines. If their applications are successful, individual members of those professions could be put in the position where they could have the legal power to sell or supply POMs which they themselves have prescribed. We recommend that professional organisations, in putting forward proposals for extensions to prescribing, should consider whether these proposals could put their members in the position of both prescribing and supplying POM medicines to the same patient and if so what safeguards are required to maintain patient safety and ensure probity . Recommendation 11: Initial prescribing and supply of medicines should normally remain separate functions in order to protect patient safety and provide other safeguards. Where a prescription cannot be furnished, the current arrangements for the emergency sale or supply of medicines should apply . Recommendation 12: Where exceptionally it is in the interests of patients for the same professional to be responsible for prescription and supply of medicines, this should be subject to clinical audit and probity checks. Recommendation 13: Professional organisations, in putting forward proposals for extensions to prescribing, should consider whether this could result in members prescribing and supplying POMs to the same patient, and if so what safeguards are required to maintain patient safety and ensure probity. The NPAC, in assessing any proposals from professional groups which could result in members prescribing and supplying POMs to the same patient, should consider the adequacy of the safeguar ds proposed. Administration of Medicines 6.60The \"administration\" of a medicine is the term used to describe the act of putting into effect a medicine either by introduction into the body, whether by direct contact with the body or not, or by external application (see Glossary). The administration of a medicine is preceded by its supply. Chapter 2 describes the restrictions on the supply of medicines which provide safeguards to patients. There are no additional restrictions on any medicine which is self- administered by the patient, or on the administration of any P or GSLproduct or POM administered orally .The only additional restrictions relate to parenteral (injectable) POMs which can only be administered:Review of Prescribing, Supply & Administration of Medicines - Final Report 58iby an \"appropriate practitioner\" (ie a doctor or dentist and certain nurses in respect of a limited list of medicines); or iiin accordance with the directions of an \"appropriate practitioner\". 6.61The Review Team proposes that newly authorised prescribers should be legally defined as \"appropriate practitioners\" in respect of designated medicines. This means that they would have the power to (i) administer POMs which they are authorised to prescribe, and (ii) give directions concerning the parenteral administration of POMs. In our view, this would be a natural extension of their prescribing responsibilities. 6.62In making this recommendation, the Review Team is assuming that all staff who administer POMs under the direction of new prescribers are or will be suitably trained. This has two consequences: iin putting forward proposals for extended prescribing, professional groups should consider any implications for the administration of medicines and should be able to give assurances that all training aspects have been covered; iiemployers and managers in all sectors who are responsible for staff who administer or who supervise the administration of medicines should ensure that they have adequate and up-to-date knowledge and skills. The Review Team has been made aware of suggestions that this may be a particular issue in sectors outside the NHS where staf f other than qualified health professionals need to administer medicines, eg schools, prisons, and local authority residential homes (see Annex H). Recommendation 14: The current arrangements for the administration and self-administration of medicines should continue to apply. Newly authorised prescribers should have the power to administer those parenteral prescription only medicines which they are authorised to prescribe, and to issue directions for the parenteral administration of the same medicines. Recommendation 15: Professional organisations, in putting forward proposals for new groups of professionals to have the authority to prescribe certain medicines, should consider the implications for administration of medicines and should ensure that all necessary training aspects are covered in their proposals.P roposed Policy Framework for Extension of Pr e s c r i b i n g 59Recommendation 16: Employers and managers in all sectors who are responsible for staff who supervise or undertake the administration of any medicines should ensure that those staff have the right training and skills to do so safely and regular opportunities for updating their knowledge . Repeatable Prescriptions 6.63Medicines legislation74authorises prescribers to indicate on the prescription that it may be dispensed more than once. It is not at present possible for a medicine to be dispensed and reimbursed more than once against the same NHS prescription,75so repeatable prescriptions are only used in the private sector .This means that when a patient requires long-term medication in the NHS, the patient has to apply to the prescriber for another prescription, known as a \"repeat prescription\". The Review Team considers that this arrangement is inconvenient to patients and could result in poor adherence to treatment. 6.64The Medicines Act also provides that no prescription can be dispensed more than six months after the date on which it was signed. However, for repeatable prescriptions, only the first dispensing must be within six months. There is no time limit for subsequent dispensing, unless specified by the prescriber, and no limit on the number of times the prescriber can direct the product to be dispensed. This means that a medicine can be dispensed long after the need for treatment has been established and possibly even when treatment may no longer be appropriate. This is wasteful and potentially dangerous. 6.65The Review Team therefore recommends that repeatable prescriptions should be available within the NHS, and that in all health care sectors they should be subject to restrictions on the number of times they can be dispensed and on the duration of their validity . Recommendation 17: Repeatable prescriptions should be available on the NHS. Recommendation 18: Limits should be introduced for the number of times a repeatable prescription can be dispensed and the duration of its validity. These restrictions should apply across all sectors, and not be limited to NHS practice.Review of Prescribing, Supply & Administration of Medicines - Final Report 6074The Prescription Only Medicines (Human Use) Order 1997. 75There are exceptions, for instance certain controlled drugs may be ordered on a special form to be dispensed in regular (typically daily) instalments.Chapter 7: Likely Impact of the Proposed Changes 7.1This chapter fulfils the second part of our terms of reference: \"to advise on the likely impact of proposed changes on clinical outcomes, the convenience of health care users, professional relationships, and costs\". Inevitably, our predictions are somewhat speculative. We do not know how our recommendations, if they are accepted by Government and the professions, will be implemented, nor do we know which professional groups will put forward a sufficiently convincing case for extended prescribing authority. However, we are confident that our recommendations will lead to benefits in the following broad areas. Clinical Outcomes 7.2We believe that our recommendations will bring clear benefits to patients in three main areas: iOur proposals will make more effective use of the skills and experience of groups of professionals who are not at present authorised to prescribe . In particular: vin many clinical situations, we foresee an end to the artificial separation of the prescribing decision from other aspects of the patient's clinical management, creating clearer accountability and increasing the patient's confidence in the consultation; vthe prescribing choice can be made by the professional with particular specialist skills and experience, resulting on occasions in more clinically appropriate and sympathetic prescribing and reducing the potential for wasteful use of resources; vdependent prescribing, in particular, opens up the possibility of making more effective use of the expert knowledge of a wider range of professionals, allowing the clinician responsible for the initial assessment to concentrate on the broad clinical management of the patient. iiWe expect in some important instances to see an improvement in patients'access to advice and treatment , resulting in better uptake of services and better concordance between the perceptions of patients and professionals: vin some situations, improved access to the prescriber will result in more timely initiation of treatment with, in some cases, reduced duration of illness, better control of chronic disease, and fewer complications; vsome vulnerable groups of people who find it difficult to access care at present may be more easily contacted by prescribers who will be able to initiate treatment immediately, reducing the risk of loss of contact with care services;Likely Impact of the Proposed Changes 61vsome new prescribers may in the course of their duties already be spending significant time with patients, resulting in better communication and thus improved adherence to treatment programmes. iiiOur proposals should on some occasions lead to better clinical oversight of patients' medication. In particular, we think that the facility for repeatable prescriptions will encourage general practitioners to set a realistic interval for full review of patients' overall clinical management, allowing pharmacists in the intervening period to assess any obvious changes in patients'condition or continuing need for medication. ivOur recommendations should ensure that all newly authorised prescribers will undertake continuing education and clinical audit related to their prescribing responsibilities, encouraging the more rapid dissemination of up-to-date practice informed by evidence on clinical and cost effectiveness. We expect that the professional bodies responsible for standards of practice for existing prescribers will wish to take account of our recommendations in the context of their arrangements for continuing professional development. Convenience of Users 7.3Our proposals will lead to a more convenient, \"seamless\" service . For example, iin the community setting, patients will be able to receive prescriptions more simply at the time of a home visit, or visit to an appropriate specialist, without the need to go to the surgery solely to pick up a prescription. One example would be treatment of patients in their own homes by tissue viability nurses; iiin the hospital setting, delays in discharge experienced by patients waiting for medicines to take home can be reduced; iiirepeatable prescriptions will allow patients on long-term medication to renew their supplies of medicines more simply, without any reduction in the level of clinical oversight of their continuing need for the medication; ivin certain circumstances, patients will be able to choose which health professional will be responsible for aspects of their care, including prescribing. Professional Relationships 7.4Relationships between professionals will be enhanced, both in primary and secondary care, through imore effective teamwork, with the improved use of the full range of skills and experience of all team members; Review of Prescribing, Supply & Administration of Medicines - Final Report 62iiimproved mutual recognition and respect for the contribution which other professions can make; iiigreater clarity of roles and responsibilities across professions. Use of resources Prescribing costs 7.5The Review Team has worked on the assumption that most patients are receiving adequate care under the NHS at present and an extension of the authority to prescribe will not result in significant increases in the volume of prescribing. Any potential increase in volume should be offset by more appropriate, timely and cost-effective prescribing, improved quality of care, less waste, and reduced costs to other parts of the public sector or to informal carers. 7.6 However, a widespread extension of the authority to prescribe has not yet been tested, and generalised conclusions for all possible groups of new prescribers cannot be drawn from the nurse prescribing pilots evaluated to date. Some financial savings can be expected from improved patient adherence to treatment and better management of repeat prescriptions. New prescribers may, however, meet demands for medicines which were previously unmet, with consequent increase in drugs expenditure. Other costs .7Any extension of prescribing to new groups of practitioners will involve training costs. These costs will include: ispecialist training in prescribing for new prescribers who are already fully professionally qualified; iicontinuing education of new prescribers as required by professional and/or regulatory bodies; iiiincorporation of prescribing training into existing training programmes. 7.8There will also be administrative costs: ifor professional and regulatory bodies in establishing and maintaining registers of legally authorised prescribers; iifor the NHS in establishing and maintaining procedures for the issue and processing of NHS prescriptions;Likely Impact of the Proposed Changes 63iiifor the Prescription Pricing Authority and other UK prescription pricing bodies76in collecting and analysing prescribing information on new prescribers; ivfor Health Departments in setting up and servicing the new advisory body . Some of these costs could be considerably reduced if and when electronic data interchange is used as part of the prescribing process (see para 8.18). Further work 7.9In assessing applications for new prescribing involving NHS reimbursement, the NPAC will need to form a judgement on whether the benefits would justify any net costs to the NHS. Where these costs could be significant or there appears to be a large degree of uncertainty these judgements should be tested through piloting and evaluation, before individual extensions to prescribing authority are rolled out on a national scale. Piloting may also be valuable for particularly innovative extensions to prescribing, so that practical issues of implementation can be assessed and resolved before general adoption is encouraged. Every effort should be made to ensure that such pilot studies do not lead to unnecessary delays in the wider introduction of improved services for patients. Recommendation 19: Where particular extensions to prescribing authority could involve significant cost to the NHS, or where the balance of cost and benefit appears to be uncertain, there should be a thorough evaluation of the likely costs and benefits to the NHS before general adoption is encouraged. This should not be allowed to result in unnecessary delays in improving care. Review of Prescribing, Supply & Administration of Medicines - Final Report 6476The Prescription Pricing Service in Wales, The Pharmacy Practice Division in Scotland, The Central Services Agency in Northern Ireland.Chapter 8: Implications for Legislation, Professional Training and Standards 8.1This chapter deals with the third part of our terms of reference: \"To consider the possible implications for legislation, and for professional training and standards\". Legislation The Medicines Act 8.2Implementation of the Review Team's recommendations to extend prescribing authority will require changes in primary legislation (the Medicines Act 1968) and in subordinate legislation. We recommend that this should be done by taking general powers in primary legislation to allow the designation of new categories of dependent and independent prescribers through secondary legislation. Consequential amendments may be needed to other legislation to allow all the relevant statutory bodies to maintain registers of approved prescribers. 8.3Changes to secondary legislation will also be needed to implement our recommendation to introduce limits on the number of times a repeatable prescription can be dispensed and the duration of its validity (paras 6.63-6.65, Recommendations 17&18). Further thought will be needed on the precise limits and whether they could vary between classes of pharmaceuticals. 8.4 Legislation might also be necessary to set up the new prescribing advisory body depending on decisions about its status. 8.5Any changes will have to comply with relevant European Union requirements. This is not expected to be a problem, as long as the required qualifications of any proposed new groups of prescribers are clearly defined. NHS legislation 8.6Some changes to primary legislation (the NHS Act 1977 and equivalents for Scotland and Northern Ireland) would probably be required in order to extend the categories of professionals who may use NHS prescriptions, and, as in the case of existing nurse prescribers, the categories of medicines they may prescribe. The aim should be to create a broad primary power which would enable ministers to designate through secondary legislation new categories of prescribers whose prescriptions could be dispensed at NHS expense, and to impose limitations on the medicines which they could specify as NHS prescriptions (analogous to the Selected List Scheme for GPs described at para 33 of Annex D). 8.7The remaining changes can be secured through changes to secondary legislation, in particularImplications for Legislation, Professional Training and Standar d s 65the regulations governing reimbursement of pharmacy contractors. Recommendation 20: The Government should take general powers in primary legislation, enabling ministers, through regulations, to designate new categories of dependent and independent prescribers for the purpose of the Medicines Act, to authorise them to prescribe medicines for reimbursement by the NHS, and to limit or specify the medicines or classes of medicines which they may prescribe. Professional training 8.8Our recommendations have profound implications for professional training. Training programmes for prescribing would need to be set up in the first instance for those health professionals who have already obtained the necessary specialist clinical qualifications. In due course, such training may be incorporated into the relevant specialist training course. It would be for the professional bodies77to decide whether in future allmembers undergoing such training should be trained as potential prescribers, or whether this would be an option within the specialism. Either way, the regulatory body for the profession will need to set up arrangements to ensure that an up-to-date register of legally authorised prescribers is maintained. 8.9In addition, we have made clear (para 6.42) that all training should include a period of supervised practice. Particular care should be taken with training relating to the use of drugs listed at para 6.53. Professional and regulatory bodies will be expected to take firm action against supervisors who fail to discharge their responsibilities. Recommendation 21: Professional groups putting forward proposals for extended prescribing should liaise with education providers and bodies responsible for approving training courses to develop suitable training programmes in the required prescribing competencies. All training should include a period of supervised practice, and professional and regulatory bodies should take firm action against supervisors who fail to discharge their responsibilities. 8.10Similarly, all professional groups which propose to take on new prescribing powers will be required to show how they will provide and assess continuing education programmes for authorised prescribers. Review of Prescribing, Supply & Administration of Medicines - Final Report 6677The precise division of responsibilities between the professional body responsible for promoting professional practice and the professional regulatory body varies between professions.8.11In the first year or two, there may be some difficulties in finding trainers with the right combination of skills to provide training for all potential new prescribers. Professional groups putting forward proposals for new prescribing should give particular attention to the way in which this problem could be overcome. 8.12All training programmes established to meet the requirements for gaining or maintaining the right to prescribe should be independently accredited by the profession's regulatory body(ies). Training programmes, whether part of initial training or of continuing professional development, should not be used to promote particular products. We recommend that the regulatory bodies should draw up clear guidelines on the acceptance of any commercial support or sponsorship for such training programmes. Recommendation 22: The professional regulatory bodies should draw up clear guidelines on the circumstances in which commercial support or sponsorship for training programmes related to prescribing could be acceptable. Training programmes should not be used to promote particular products. Professional standards 8.13The Review Team expects that the examination of potential prescribers will be supervised by the relevant professional regulatory bodies. These bodies would be responsible for iensuring that health professionals seeking prescribing authority for the first time are properly assessed, with the involvement of independent assessors; iiensuring that authorised prescribers take part in satisfactory programmes of continuing professional development related to prescribing; iiiensuring that the content of professional training programmes takes account of changing needs, and that any such changes are appropriately monitored; ivensuring the review of clinical audit on a sample basis to ensure that any points of general application are fed back into the content of training, and if necessary reported to the MCA and the NPAC if there are implications for the prescribing formulary; vkeeping the adequacy of the prescribing formulary under review and for submitting to the MCA any proposals for changes that may be needed to meet changing clinical requirements.Implications for Legislation, Professional Training and Standar d s 67Recommendation 23: Professional organisations considering applying for extended prescribing authority should, in conjunction with the appropriate professional regulatory organisations, ensure that adequate arrangements would be established for iaccrediting training programmes for prescribing; iimaintaining a register of individuals who have acquired and are maintaining competency as prescribers; iiireviewing the results of clinical audit programmes and ensuring that any general lessons are fed back into the content of training; ivkeeping the content of the prescribing formulary under review and submitting any proposals for change to the Medicines Control Agency . 8.14The maintenance of professional standards of practice cannot however be assured by the requirements of professional and regulatory bodies. Modern professional education in all disciplines seeks to establish a culture and expectation of life-long learning and to impress on all those who qualify the need to take personal responsibility for maintaining and updating their knowledge and practice and for taking part in externally validated clinical audit. The Review Team strongly endorses this attitude and therefore includes a formal recommendation aimed at individual practitioners, as a reminder that they are the prime custodians of safe and effective clinical practice, including prescribing. Recommendation 24: All legally authorised prescribers should take personal responsibility for maintaining and updating their knowledge and practice related to prescribing, including taking part in clinical audit, and should never prescribe in situations beyond their professional competence. Organisational and administrative aspects 8.15The regulatory body for each profession will need to set up arrangements ito identify and register or record all those members who satisfactorily complete training as authorised prescribers; iito ensure that this information is kept up to date, and is readily accessible to legitimate enquirers, such as health authorities, employers and pharmacists;Review of Prescribing, Supply & Administration of Medicines - Final Report 68iiito ensure that prescribers provide evidence of continuing education and participation in audit at regular intervals, as a condition of remaining on the prescribers register; ivto deal with any allegations against their members of serious deficiencies in their prescribing practice. 8.16Health authorities78and primary care groups79will need to take account of the presence of additional prescribers in setting budgets, in arrangements for funding professional education and training, and in monitoring prescribing patterns. Central government, through the prescription pricing bodies, will need to ensure that information on prescribing by new prescribers can be analysed and fed back to practitioners and to their employing authorities in ways which are helpful and encourage better prescribing. 8.17The introduction of independent and dependent categories of prescriber will necessitate the provision of new administrative arrangements, including prescription forms. At present, separate identifiable NHS prescription pads are issued to nurse prescribers. Similar pads could be used by other independent prescribers. Prescription forms for use by dependent prescribers should state the name of the clinician who is responsible for initial clinical assessment of the patient (usually the patient's general practitioner). 8.18New arrangements would also be needed to introduce repeatable prescriptions into the NHS (see paras 6.63-6.65, and Recommendations 17&18). These are likely to include amendments to the existing prescription form system, for example to allow details of the number and timing of instalments to be set out in a safe and auditable way; corresponding changes to prescription pricing bodies' computer systems; and some adaptation of patient medication record systems in community pharmacies. 8.19These practical arrangements could be greatly simplified by the effective use of information technology (IT), and in particular by the electronic exchange of information on medication and on other aspects of patients' treatment. We have noted in para 6.19 the particular need for good communications between independent and dependent prescribers. The Review Team therefore warmly welcomes the proposals set out in the recently published NHS IT strategy80 for the introduction of electronic health records (lifelong summary records of patients' health and health care) and electronic patient records (more detailed records of particular aspects of care). When implemented, these systems will provide a mechanism for the transfer of clinical and medication information between professionals which is essential for safe and effective prescribing.Implications for Legislation, Professional Training and Standar d s 6978Health Boards in Scotland, Health and Personal Social Services Boards in Northern Ireland. 79Local Health Care Co-operatives in Scotland, Local Health Groups in Wales [no equivalent has been established in Northern Ireland as yet]. 80NHS Executive Information for health: an information strategy for the modern NHS (NHS Executive, September 1998).Evaluation and monitoring 8.20The new arrangements should be subject to evaluation and monitoring, for which appropriate resources should be made available. This needs to take place at various levels, for a number of complementary purposes: iprofessional and regulatory bodies, especially in the early years of prescribing by any new group, need to monitor carefully the clinical practice of individual prescribers and to draw out as quickly as possible any general lessons which could affect the training and assessment of future prescribers (para 8.13); iihealth authorities, Trusts and primary care groups81need to monitor prescribing patterns as part of their clinical governance arrangements, and to take action as needed to improve the appropriateness of prescribing by individual prescribers (para 8.14); iiicentral government should establish pilot studies of some aspects of extended prescribing, where necessary, within time frames that provide satisfactory information for decisions on the extension of such services, but which do not unduly delay the wider introduction of improved services to patients (para 7.9). Recommendation 25: The new arrangements should be subject to evaluation and monitoring, for which appropriate resources should be made available. 8.21There are particular issues over monitoring and evaluation in the private sector, where the information systems for routine analysis of prescribing data may not be as well-developed as in the NHS. Private primary health care may be particularly problematic. Pharmacists are required to keep records of private prescriptions, but this information is not routinely available for clinical audit. These issues go beyond our terms of reference, but should be considered further by the Health Departments (see Annex H).Review of Prescribing, Supply & Administration of Medicines - Final Report 7081See footnotes 60-62 for the equivalents in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.Chapter 9: Summary of Conclusions and Recommendations Conclusions 9.1Professional practice is changing in response to changing patterns of clinical care, professional education and patient expectations. These trends have not been fully reflected in the arrangements for the prescribing, supply and administration of medicines. (Chapter 3) 9.2.Our consultation exercise revealed considerable support for an extension of the groups of professionals who may prescribe, which would be expected to improve multidisciplinary team-work and to make the fullest use of professional skills. (Chapter 5) 9.3The literature and international experience both support further moves in this direction. (Chapter 5) 9.4The general practitioner should continue to be responsible in most circumstances for the co- ordination of the patient's care. (Chapter 6) 9.5The majority of patients should continue to receive medicines on an individual, patient- specific basis. Exceptionally, it may be in patients' interests to supply or administer medicines under group protocols. In either case, the provision of medicines to patients should ensure that patient safety is not compromised or put at risk. It should make the best use of professional expertise and the most effective use of resources. (Chapter 6) 9.6The extension of prescribing to new professional groups, subject to safeguards which would be established by the professional regulatory bodies, would yield benefits to patient care, improved patient convenience and better team-working between professionals. (Chapter 7) 9.7The available evidence is insufficient to enable us to determine whether specific extensions to NHS prescribing would increase or reduce total NHS running costs. Some initial costs for training new prescribers are inevitable. Each proposal will need to be scrutinised to assess whether extended prescribing at NHS expense would represent a good use of NHS resources. (Chapter 7) 9.8Legislation, both primary and secondary, would be required to implement our recommendations. (Chapter 8)S u m m a r y of Conclusions and Recommendations 71Recommendations Recommendations to Health Departments 1.The legal authority in the United Kingdom to prescribe, including authorising NHS expenditure, should be extended beyond currently authorised prescribers . (Para 6.6) 2.Legal authority for new professional groups to prescribe or to authorise NHS expenditure should normally be limited to medicines in specific therapeutic areas related to the particular competence and expertise of the group and may include prescription only medicines within those areas. (Para 6.10) 3.Two types of prescriber should be recognised: ithe independent prescriber who is responsible for the assessment of patients with undiagnosed conditions and for decisions about the clinical management required, including prescribing. At present, doctors, dentists and certain nurses in respect of a limited list of medicines are legally authorised prescribers who fulfil the requirements for independent prescribers and this should continue. Certain other health professionals may also become newly legally authorised independent prescribers, subject to the process described below . iithe dependent prescriber who is responsible for the continuing care of patients who have been clinically assessed by an independent prescriber .This continuing car e may include prescribing, which will usually be informed by clinical guidelines and will be consistent with individual treatment plans; or continuing established treatments by issuing repeat prescriptions, with the authority to adjust the dose or dosage form according to the patients'needs. There should be provision for regularclinical review by the assessing clinician. (Para 6.19) 6.AUK-wide provisionally entitled the \"New Prescribers Advisor y Committee\", should be established under Section 4 of the Medicines Act to assess submissions from professional organisations seeking powers for suitably trained members to become independent or dependent prescribers. (Para 6.27) 10.Newly authorised groups of prescribers should not normally be allowed to prescribe medicines in the following categories: icontrolled drugs (drugs subject to the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971); iiunlicensed drugs, or drugs used outside their licensed indications;Review of Prescribing, Supply & Administration of Medicines - Final Report 72iii\"black triangle\" drugs; ivdrugs over which there is continuing professional concern, eg drugs used to treat children and young people with mental health problems; vdrugs which on public health grounds should be subject to particular safeguards, forinstance antibacterial antibiotics. (Para 6.54) 14.The current arrangements for the administration and self-administration of medicines should continue to apply. Newly authorised prescribers should have the power to administer those parenteral prescription only medicines which they are authorised to prescribe, and to issue directions for the parenteral administration of the same medicines. (Para 6.62) 17.Repeatable prescriptions should be available on the NHS. (Para 6.65) 18.Limits should be introduced for the number of times a repeatable prescription can be dispensed and the duration of its validity .These restrictions should apply across all sectors, and not be limited to NHS practice. (Para 6.65) 19.W h e re part i c u l a rextensions to prescribing authority could involve significant cost to the NHS, orw h e re the balance of cost and benefit appears to be uncertain, there should be a t h o rough evaluation of the likely costs and benefits to the NHS before general adoption is encouraged. This should not be allowed to result in unnecessary delays in improving car e . (Para 7.9) 20.The Government should take general powers in primary legislation, enabling ministers, through regulations, to designate new categories of dependent and independent prescribers for the purpose of the Medicines Act, to authorise them to prescribe medicines for reimbursement by the NHS, and to limit or specify the medicines or classes of medicines which they may prescribe. (Para 8.7) 25.The new arrangements should be subject to evaluation and monitoring, for which appropriate resources should be made available. (Para 8.19) Recommendations to Health Departments and professional bodies 4.There should be adequate arrangements for sharing information between independent and dependent prescribers. In particular ,S u m m a r y of Conclusions and Recommendations 73iboth clinicians should have access to a complete medication record, and iiboth clinicians should have access to relevant parts of the patient's medical record. (Para 6.19) 5.Changes to patterns of clinical care using new models for the prescribing, supply and administration of medicines should be introduced only after full consultation with patient interests, and should wherever possible increase patient choice. (Para 6.23) 11.Initial prescribing and supply of medicines should normally remain separate functions in orderto protect patient safety and provide other safeguards. Where a prescription cannot be furnished, the current arrangements for the emergency sale or supply of medicines should apply . (Para 6.59) Recommendation to Health Departments, professional bodies, HAs and employers 12.Where exceptionally it is in the interests of patients for the same professional to be responsible for prescription and supply of medicines, this should be subject to clinical audit and probity checks. (Para 6.59) Recommendations to professional bodies 7.Proposals for new professional groups to be considered as potential prescribers will be expected to come from nationally recognised organisations. They should confirm that the group is formally recognised by the appropriate regulatory body and that that body has seen and is content with the proposed arrangements for training in prescribing and for registration. (Para 6.33) 13.Professional organisations, in putting forward proposals for extensions to prescribing, should consider whether this could result in members prescribing and supplying POMs to the same patient, and if so what safeguards are required to maintain patient safety and ensure probity .The NPAC, in assessing any proposals from professional groups which could result in members prescribing and supplying POMs to the same patient, should consider the adequacy of the safeguards proposed. (Para 6.59) 15.Professional organisations, in putting forward proposals for new groups of professionals to have the authority to prescribe certain medicines, should consider the implications for administration of medicines and should ensure that all necessary training aspects ar e covered in their proposals. (Para 6.62)Review of Prescribing, Supply & Administration of Medicines - Final Report 7421.Professional groups putting forward proposals for extended prescribing should liaise with education providers and bodies responsible for approving training courses to develop suitable training programmes in the required prescribing competencies. All training should include a period of supervised practice, and professional and regulator y bodies should take firm action against supervisors who fail to discharge their responsibilities. (Para 8.9) 22.The professional regulatory bodies should draw up clear guidelines on the circumstances in which commercial support or sponsorship for training programmes related to prescribing could be acceptable. Training programmes should not be used to promote particular products. (Para 8.12) 23.Professional organisations considering applying for extended prescribing authority should, in conjunction with the appropriate professional regulatory organisations, ensur e that adequate arrangements would be established for iaccrediting training programmes for prescribing; iimaintaining a register of individuals who have acquired and are maintaining competency as prescribers; iiireviewing the results of clinical audit programmes and ensuring that any general lessons are fed back into the content of training; ivkeeping the content of the prescribing formulary under review and submitting any proposals for change to the Medicines Control Agency . (Para 8.13) Recommendations to the GMC/GDC and postgraduate deans 8.The GMC and postgraduate deans should agree a safe framework within which pre- registration house officers (PRHOs) could prescribe medicines relevant to the duties of theirpost. Such prescribing should be subject to close monitoring by their clinical supervisor, with due regard to the proper discharge of supervisory responsibility as specified in Recommendation 21. (Para 6.51) 9.Overseas doctors given provisional registration by the GMC and required to undertake clinical training similar to that of a PRHO, and overseas dentists, given temporar y registration by the GDC to practice in an approved training post in a NHS hospital, should be able to prescribe under similarsafeguards to those described in Recommendation 8. (Para 6.52)S u m m a r y of Conclusions and Recommendations 75Recommendation to employers 16.Employers and managers in all sectors who are responsible for staff who supervise or undertake the administration of any medicines should ensure that those staff have the right training and skills to do so safely and regular opportunities for updating their knowledge. (Para 6.62) Recommendation to individual practitioners 24.All legally authorised prescribers should take personal responsibility for maintaining and updating their knowledge and practice related to prescribing, including taking par t in clinical audit, and should never prescribe in situations beyond their professional competence.

It is drawn up locally by doctors, pharmacists and other appropriate professionals, and approved by the employer, advised by the relevant professional advisory committees. It applies to groups of patients or other service users who may not be individually identified before presentation for treatment. 2.Group protocols or guidelines, corresponding more or less closely to this definition, are already in widespread use in the NHS. However, the legality of such arrangements has been called into question; and some current arrangements fall short of the standards required to ensure safe clinical practice. The Review Team were therefore asked to submit an interim report specifically on this aspect of their terms of reference. 3.The Team's conclusions and recommendations were as follows: \"Conclusions vThe Review Team considers that the majority of clinical care should be provided on an individual, patient-specific basis. The supply and administration of medicines by group protocols should be reserved for those limited situations where this offers an advantage for patient care, and where it is consistent with appropriate professional relationships and accountability. Group protocols should comply with the general principles for the supply and administration of medicines in other circumstances. vThe Review Team believes that, even if the authority to prescribe is extended more widely in the future to health professionals other than existing prescribers, there will still be a need for supply and administration of medicines under group protocols in certain limited situations as a component of comprehensive health care. vPatient safety can only be protected if group protocols for the supply and administration of medicines are clear and comprehensive. The Review Team proposes that group protocols should comply with the guidance framework in Appendix A[not attached to this summary]. Review of Prescribing, Supply & Administration of Medicines - Final Report 8884Review of prescribing, supply and administration of medicines: A report on the supply and administration of medicines under group protocols (Department of Health, London, April 1998).We recommend that: 1.The majority of patients should continue to receive medicines on an individual basis. However, there is likely to be a continuing need for supply and administration under group protocols in certain limited situations as part of a comprehensive health service. 2.Current safe and effective practice using group protocols which are consistent with the criteria at Appendix Ashould continue (see also Recommendation 5). 3.The law should be clarified to ensure that health professionals who supply or administer medicines under approved group protocols are acting within the law . 4.All group protocols should comply with the criteria specified in Appendix A. 5.Current protocols should be reviewed in the light of those criteria. 6.The criteria for group protocols should be widely disseminated by the Health Departments in association with relevant professional bodies. 7.Consideration should be given to commissioning an evaluation study of the use of group protocols including health outcomes. 8.These recommendations should apply to all sectors of health care including the private and charitable sectors.S u m m a r y of the Recommendations from the Report on Supply and Administration under Group Pr o t o c o l 89Annex D: Current Arrangements for the Prescription, Supply and Administration of Medicines85 Background 1.Under UK law, the legislative requirements relating to the prescribing, supply and administration of medicines are set out in the Medicines Act 1968, and in secondary legislation made under the Act, certain parts of which are implemented by EU legislation (Directive 92/26/EEC). Legislation on the reimbursement of medicines under the NHS is derived from the NHS Act 1977. Definitions 2.\"Prescribe\". Neither \"prescribe\" nor \"prescription\" are defined in the Medicines Act. In principle, anyone can write a prescription, but medicines can only be sold or supplied against them in specified circumstances. Subordinate legislation (the Prescription Only Medicines (Human Use) Order 1997 - the \"POM\" Order 1997) sets out some of the practical requirements for prescribing, for instance a prescription must be signed by the practitioner giving it, written in ink, and satisfy other specified requirements. 3.\"Supply and Administer\". Part III of the Medicines Act includes the sections which deal with the sale and supply of medicines for human and for veterinary use. In the Medicines Act, \"administer\" means to give a medicine to a human being (or an animal) orally, by injection or by introduction into the body in any other way, or by external application, whether by direct contact with the body or not. Certain provisions, such as section 58 of the Act, make a clear distinction between the controls on supplying and on administering, whereas others refer only to selling or supplying, where it seems that administration could be incorporated into the latter . Categories of Medicines 4.Medicines are divided into three categories (their legal status), depending mainly on the dangers they pose and the risk of misuse:- iPrescription Only Medicine (POM); iiPharmacy Medicine (P); and iiiGeneral Sale List (GSL).Review of Prescribing, Supply & Administration of Medicines - Final Report 9085This annex sets out a guide to key relevant legislation for the purposes of this report. It is not a legal document and is not intended to be definitive.Amedicinal product will be a P medicine unless specific legal provision has been made to make it either a GSL or POM. The substances which are GSL are listed in the Medicines (Products Other than Veterinary Drugs) (General Sales List) Order 1984 as amended [\"the GSLOrder\"]; those which are POM are listed in the POM Order 1997. Sale, supply and administration of Medicines General principles 5.GSLmedicines may be sold or supplied from any lockable business premises (section 53 Medicines Act). P and POM medicines may only be sold or supplied by or under the supervision of a pharmacist from registered premises (section 52 Medicines Act), although there are some exemptions. 6.POMs have an additional restriction in that they may only be supplied by a pharmacist against the prescription of an \"appropriate practitioner\" - ie doctors, dentists and certain nurses (in respect of a specified list of POMs) who have been specified in an order made under section 58 of the Medicines Act. 7.In addition, POMs may only be administered by or in accordance with directions from an appropriate practitioner . 8.The nurses who are \"appropriate practitioners\" are either:- iregistered in Part 1 or 12 of the Register maintained by the UKCC under section 10 of the Nurses, Midwives and Health Visitors Act 1979 and holding a district nursing qualification recorded in the professional register under rule 11 of the Nurses, Midwives and Health Visitors Rules 1983; or iiregistered as a qualified health visitor in Part 11 of the professional register , and in either case, with an entry against the nurse's name in the relevant register signifying that s/he is qualified to order drugs, medicines and appliances for patients. 9.Such nurses were able to become appropriate practitioners as a result of the Medicinal Products: Prescription by Nurses Act 1992 and SI 1994/3050 (which amended an earlier POM Order, the POM Order 1983). This legislation followed the work of the Advisory Group on Nurse Prescribing, chaired by Dr June Crown, which led to the 1989 Report on Nurse Prescribing and Supply . 10.There is a specific and limited list of products which such nurses may prescribe. These are set out in a Schedule to the POM Order .C u rrent A rrangements for the Prescription, Supply and Administration of Medicines 91Exemptions for the sale and supply of Ps and POMs 11.The exemptions from the general requirement that Ps and POMs can only be sold or supplied by a pharmacist are set out in both primary and secondary legislation. With regard to both Ps and POMs, section 55(1) of the Medicines Act specifies that:- idoctors and dentists may sell or supply medicines to their patients or to a person under whose care the patient is. Within the NHS this power is modified to restrict these activities - eg only doctors in designated rural areas may dispense any medicine to their patients. Non-dispensing doctors may administer medicines personally to their patients and may provide small quantities for immediate treatment. ii medicines may be sold or supplied in the course of the business of a \"hospital or health centre\", for the purpose of being administered (whether in the hospital or health centre or elsewhere) in accordance with the directions of a doctor or dentist. Secondary legislation: exemptions for supply and administration of POMs 12.The POM Order sets out further exemptions to the requirement that POMs can only be soldor supplied by a pharmacist against a lawful prescription, or administered under the directions of an appropriate practitioner .These allow: ispecified drugs for parenteral administration (injection) to be administered by anyone for the purpose of saving life in an emergency; ii the administration of all POMs except those which are administered parenterally; iii a POM to be soldor suppliedin the course of the business of a hospital provided the POM is sold or supplied in accordance with the written directions of a doctor or dentist notwithstanding that those directions do not fulfil the usual conditions which apply to writing prescriptions (eg the giving of addresses, dates, signing in ink etc); iv the saleor supply only or parenteral administration by specified categories of persons, of specified products under certain conditions. These detailed exemptions are set out in schedules to the POM Order .They apply to people such as state registered chiropodists who hold a certificate of competence in the use of analgesics, registered midwives, the owner or master of a ship which does not carry a doctor on board, or ambulance paramedics, who may administer medicines in their list, provided they comply with specified conditions; vcertain drugs to be suppliedin an emergency by community pharmacists. 13.The Medicines (Pharmacy and General Sale - Exemption) Order 1980 exempts certain categories of persons, including professional groups, from the restrictions which apply to selling or supplying specified P and GSL medicines. These include midwives and chiropodists. Review of Prescribing, Supply & Administration of Medicines - Final Report 92Statutory Medicines Act committees 14.The Medicines Act creates a framework for statutory committees and establishes the Medicines Commission as an expert body to advise ministers on matters arising under the Act. 15.The Medicines Commission is established by section 2 which sets out minimum membership criteria and specifies the disciplines which must be represented on the Commission. The disciplines which must be represented include human medicine, veterinary medicine, pharmacy, chemistry (other than pharmaceutical chemistry) and the pharmaceutical industry . Appointments are made by ministers and one of the members is appointed as Chairman. 16.The Commission's role is to provide advice to ministers on matters relating to the execution of the Act or the exercise of any power conferred by it. They also advise on matters relating to medicinal products (whether or not in relation to the Act) and are expressly authorised by section 3(1) to provide advice to Ministers either at their request or in circumstances where the Commission considers it expedient. 17.The Commission also has the function of making recommendations to ministers with regard to the functions of other committees established under the Act. There is however no requirement that the Commission oversee the work of any such committees. 18.By section 4, ministers may establish committees (\"section 4 committees\") for any purpose connected with the execution of the Act and the exercise of any power conferred by it, whether generally or in relation to any particular class of medicines. Before establishing the committee ministers must consult with appropriate organisations and this would always include the Medicines Commission. Nevertheless section 4 committees are not sub- committees of the Medicines Commission. Rather they are independent bodies established to advise ministers. The best known of these committees is the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) but other section 4 Committees established each have their own character and do not necessarily operate in the same way as the CSM. In some areas practices have grown up so that decisions made on the advice of the CSM are appealed or reviewed by the Commission. There is however now no statutory requirement that this should happen as a matter of course86and the practice does not affect all aspects of decision making under the Act. 19.The creation of a further section 4 committee with a remit to consider matters arising out of this Review might require some amendment to primary legislation if the committee were to advise ministers on cost-effectiveness. If it were not, its creation would be reasonably straightforward. The public consultation on the changes envisaged by the Review would, subject to ministers' views, specifically include a consultation on the remit of the new proposed committee and on the criteria for appointments. The committee would be established by an order without any Parliamentary procedure and this would govern (ifC u rrent A rrangements for the Prescription, Supply and Administration of Medicines 9386Except for a few products which are not available elsewhere in the European Community and for which an authorisation or renewal application was made between 1 January 1995 and 31 December 1997 and is pending.inclusion of these features were considered desirable) the disciplines to be represented in the membership. Members would then be appointed by ministers and would perform the functions set out in the establishment order . European Community Law 20.Until comparatively recently, little attention has been given at EC level to the classification of medicinal products so Member States have developed different systems. However, the Community is now seeking to harmonize the classification arrangements. 21.The Legal Status Directive (92/26/EEC) provides that, when Member States authorise a product, they must categorise it as either to be subject to medical prescription or not to be subject to medical prescription. The Directive also sets out the criteria which are used to determine whether a product should be available on prescription only .These criteria are set out in section 58A of the UK Medicines Act. \"Medical prescription\" is \"any prescription issued by a professional person qualified to prescribe medicinal products\". There is no definition of \"prescription\", and there is no distinction between prescribing and supplying as is set out in the UK Medicines Act. The classification is considered in terms of the status of the product rather than of the person prescribing or supplying it. Otherrelevant public health legislation 22.Although the Medicines Act 1968 and related provisions under the Act apply to the prescribing, supply and administration of all medicines, the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 1985 apply further safeguards to those activities in relation to drugs which are controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 but which also have therapeutic uses and are used as medicines. The Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 23.The Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 controls the availability of drugs liable to misuse. The drugs which are subject to the Act's controls are termed \"Controlled Drugs\" (CDs). They are listed in Schedule 2 of the Act and separated into three Classes - Class A, Class B or Class C, depending on the level of control under which the drugs have been placed by the United Nations Convention on Narcotic Drugs. 24.The Act contains provisions relating to the import, export, supply and possession of controlled drugs; the safe custody of controlled drugs; offences and penalties relating to unlawful possession and trafficking. 25.Where a medicinal product contains a controlled drug it will be subject to the Medicines Act 1968, but with the Misuse of Drugs legislation providing an additional level of control. Medicinal products containing controlled drugs are all POMs. Review of Prescribing, Supply & Administration of Medicines - Final Report 94The Misuse of Drugs Regulations 1985 26.The use of controlled drugs as medicines is permitted by the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 1985. These regulations enable the manufacture on a commercial scale and wholesaling of controlled drugs to be undertaken under licence obtained from the Home Office, and they confer authority on doctors, dentists, veterinary surgeons and practitioners, pharmacists and certain other persons (eg police constables and registered midwives) to possess, supply , prescribe and/or administer controlled drugs in the practice of their professions. The regulations and schedules set out which drugs may be used, by which persons, and in what circumstances. Other legislation relating to Controlled Drugs 27.Further conditions relating to Controlled Drugs are set out in The Misuse of Drugs (Notification of and Supply to Addicts) Regulations 1973, The Misuse of Drugs (Supply to Addicts) Regulations 1997 , and the Misuse of Drugs (Safe Custody) Regulations 1973. NHS Legislation87 The basic structure 2 8 .The NHS Act 1977 consists of two parts, which describe different systems. Part I of the Act is primarily concerned with the provision of health care in hospitals and the provision of community health services. Part II of the Act is concerned with the provision of family health services (general medical, general dental, general ophthalmic and pharmaceutical services) which are provided in the community. In general, health professionals working under Part I arrangements are salaried employees of an NHS body, whereas health professionals under Part II are self-employed, or employees of an individual, a partnership or a private corporate body who have made arrangements with an NHS Health Authority for the provision of services. 29.The NHS Act has been significantly amended and in particular by ithe NHS and Community Care Act 1990 which introduced the distinction between \"purchasers\" (health authorities and GP fundholders) and \"providers\" (NHS hospital or community trusts); iithe Medicinal Products Prescription by Nurses [etc] Act 1992, which allowed certain nurses to prescribe some medicines as part of NHS services; iiithe Health Authorities Act 1995 which was concerned with the functions and funding of the Health Authorities; andC u rrent A rrangements for the Prescription, Supply and Administration of Medicines 9587The description below is for England and Wales. There are some significant differences in Scotland and Northern Ireland, though the basic structure is the same.ivthe NHS (Primary Care) Act 1997 which introduced changes applying primarily to doctors and dentists which enabled what were previously Part II services to be delivered under a more flexible system (\"Personal Medical Services\" or \"Personal Dental Services\") within Part I of the Act. 30.In hospitals and the community health services, medicines are usually provided as an integral part of clinical care under Part I of the Act. In certain circumstances (eg in some outpatient clinics) hospital doctors and dentists and community trust nurse prescribers write prescriptions that are subsequently dispensed in the community, as Part II pharmaceutical services. 31.The legal basis for the provision of \"pharmaceutical services\" in the community, including the dispensing of NHS prescriptions, is set out in sections 41 and 43 of Part II of the Act, and in the NHS (Pharmaceutical Services) Regulations 1992. These regulations require Health Authorities to provide pharmaceutical services, mainly by arrangements with pharmacists, and to set out the terms of service within which such pharmacists must operate. 32.The Pharmaceutical Services Regulations also contain provisions which ienable certain doctors in specified rural areas to dispense to specified patients; iirequire all doctors to provide drugs needed for the immediate treatment of their patients; iiienable all doctors to provide drugs which are personally administered by them to their patients. Restrictions 33.There are some restrictions on the range of medicines which may be provided and publicly funded through NHS prescriptions. Dentists providing general dental services may only prescribe those medicines listed on the Secretary of State's dental list and nurse prescribers may only prescribe in accordance with the Secretary of State's nurse prescribing formulary . GPs who are providing general medical services are required to prescribe in accordance with their terms of service set out in the NHS (General Medical Services) Regulations 1992 (paras 43-46 of Schedule 2). These prohibit them from prescribing at NHS expense any medicines listed in Schedule 10, and place conditions on the prescribing of medicines in Schedule 11. A non-statutory committee, the Advisory Committee on NHS Drugs (the ACD), advises ministers on the medicines to be included in Schedule 10, although ministers may act on their own initiative without seeking the ACD's advice provided that the criteria for their decisions are verifiable and objective.88Review of Prescribing, Supply & Administration of Medicines - Final Report 9688The \"Transparency\" directive, Council Directive 89/105/EEC.Funding 34.Sections 97-97A of Part II of the Act contain the legal basis for reimbursing the costs of pharmaceuticals. Section 97(1) provides for payment by the Secretary of State to Health Authorities sums equal to their \"general Part II expenditure\", ie the actual cost of payments to those providing family health services excluding any elements which have been brought within HA cash limits. At present, the reimbursement of pharmacists for the costs of the medicines they dispense forms part of the non-cash limited \"general Part II expenditure\". It is envisaged that from April 1999 they will become part of cash-limited expenditure under section 97(3A). 35.The Pharmaceutical Services Regulations require the Secretary of State to compile and publish a statement, referred to as the Drug Tariff, which gives details of the prices at which medicines will be reimbursed and the rates of remuneration for pharmacists. Payments for the supply of drugs by doctors under the Pharmaceutical Services Regulations are contained in the Secretary of State's Statement of Fees and Allowances. 36.The changes introduced in the NHS (Primary Care) Act 1997 will have relatively little impact on the arrangements for reimbursement of the costs of medicines. In particular, doctors and dentists providing personal medical services (PMS) or personal dental services will still have their prescriptions dispensed as pharmaceutical services under Part II of the Act. Designation of new NHS prescribers 37.In order to enable additional professional groups to prescribe at NHS expense, it would be necessary to make further amendments to the definition of \"pharmaceutical services\" in section 41 of the NHS Act. As suggested in the main report, it would probably be most convenient to take a broad power through primary legislation, enabling ministers to nominate specific groups of new prescribers, and to define or vary the range of medicines they are authorised to prescribe at NHS expense, through secondary legislation.C u rrent A rrangements for the Prescription, Supply and Administration of Medicines 97Annex E: Copy of Consultation Letter 19 June 1997 Dear Colleague REVIEW OFPRESCRIBING, SUPPL YAND ADMINISTRATION OF MEDICINES 1. I am writing to invite you to submit evidence to the review currently taking place into the arrangements for the prescribing, supply and administration of medicines. 2. The Review was set up in March following the publication by the Department of Health last December of its White Paper \"Primary Care: Delivering the Future\", which announced proposals to review the current arrangements for the prescribing, supply and administration of medicines, and to consider whether any changes should be made to those arrangements. The Review is not intended to look at the current arrangements for the dispensing of medicines. The Review Team has members from a wide range of backgrounds, who are listed in Annex A. The Terms of Reference of the review are at Annex B. 3. The Review Team would welcome your advice on: ithe extent of perceived problems (if any) with current arrangements; iithe options for change; iiiexamples of specific clinical circumstances which could be used by the review team to test the adequacy of existing arrangements and the advantages and disadvantages of possible changes. I would be grateful if, in replying, you would address the attached list of questions as well as any other relevant issues you would like to bring to the team's attention. It would be extremely helpful if all general comments could, as far as possible, be illustrated by reference to specific clinical examples. We would also appreciate copies of any relevant reports or other material which we might not otherwise have picked up through a standard literature search. 4. Replies to the questions will be considered in the first instance by 4 sub-groups which are currently being set up to support the Review Team, covering the needs of patients in the following broad areas (i) \"healthy\" patients (ie those with self-limiting illness/those capable of advised self-medication); (ii) people with chronic/progressive illness living in the community; (iii) people with serious conditions requiring rapid response; (iv) people with mental health and behavioural problems, including those in prisons and special hospitals. Review of Prescribing, Supply & Administration of Medicines - Final Report 985. The sub-groups or the Review Team may wish to seek supplementary written or oral evidence from some respondents. Individual replies will be treated as strictly confidential to the Review Team and its secretariat, although a list of parties giving evidence and a non- attributable summary of the main findings is likely to appear in the final report. 6. I attach a list of the organisations to whom this letter is being sent. I should be grateful if you would copy this letter to any other organisations or individuals who you think might wish to submit comments. 7. If on reflection you do not feel that you have any contribution to make to the review it would be very helpful if you could drop me a short note to say so. Please send replies to me, Dr June Crown, c/o Review Secretariat Room 6E64, Quarry House Quarry Hill LEEDS LS2 7UE to arrive by 21 July 1997. Yours sincerely Dr June Crown Chairman, Review TeamCopy of the Consultation Letter 99ISSUES TO BE ADDRESSED Please illustrate all replies as far as you can with reference to specific clinical circumstances. Examples of innovation, whether successful or unsuccessful, would be particularly helpful. Definitions of some of the terms used are given at the end of the list of questions. A.General 1.Bearing in mind the criteria of patient safety, clinical effectiveness, effective use of resources, access to services and patient convenience a.what features of the current arrangements for the prescribing, supply and administration of medicines do you believe are particularly valuable and need to be retained in some form? b.what features could be improved? c.what features are now obsolete and should be discarded? d.what inconsistencies and anomalies are there in current arrangements and how could these be removed? 2.To the extent that you see change as desirable, what steps would be needed to encourage successful change to take place (eg changes to legislation, professional roles, training etc)? B. Specific (i)Prescribing 3.At present, it is usual for one health professional to assess/diagnose the patient's condition, choose the broad treatment strategy and also to take the detailed prescribing decision. Is this essential? Would a separation of diagnosis/assessment from the treatment decision (and/or separation of the choice of the broad treatment strategy from the detailed prescribing decision) raise any unusual issues of clinical, legal and financial accountability? 4.Is it always necessary to establish a full a priori diagnosis and assessment of the patient' s condition, or are there circumstances in which a more limited assessment, within a relatively limited range of alternatives, would be sufficient without compromising patient safety? 5.How far would it be desirable/practicable to extend education and training of particular professional groups to enable them to prescribe for specific conditions from a restricted formulary? What professional groups should be considered for this kind of limited prescribing role? In each case, how far would this build on existing skills and competencies and how far would additional training be needed?Review of Prescribing, Supply & Administration of Medicines - Final Report 1006.Is it in principle acceptable for continuation of prescribing (with or without subsequent adjustment of the details of treatment) to be carried out by a different professional from the original prescriber? How far in practice would this differ from current experiments in repeat dispensing (see Q11)? What are the implications for professional roles, responsibilities and accountability? 7.Are there any circumstances in which the professional status of the prescriber could influence the patient's readiness a.to seek clinical advice, b.to accept that advice as authoritative? What are the implications for this review? 8.Is there any danger that an extension of the role of other health professionals in prescribing could lead to fragmentation of patient care? What could be done to ensure that the GP or other responsible doctor is still able to maintain an overview of the care of the patient? (ii)Supply of medicines 9.It is usual practice for one professional (eg a doctor or dentist) to write a prescription, and for another (eg a pharmacist) to supply it or administer it (eg a nurse). How important is this traditional separation of roles, eg in relation to patient safety? With reference to specific examples, how far does this derive from a.the complementary skills of the two professionals concerned, b.the wish to improve safety in the administration of medicines (eg double checking of the prescribed dosage)? 10.Under what circumstances might it be (i) desirable, or (ii) essential for the patient to be given a (possibly small) supply of the medicine prescribed at or immediately following the consultation (eg where there is a need for early treatment or for patient convenience)? What are the implications for professional roles and responsibilities? 11.Would you wish to see a wider use of repeat dispensing (ie multiple dispensing under the professional oversight of a pharmacist following an assessment and prescription by a doctor)? (iii) Supply or administration of medicines under protocol 12.Are there any circumstances in which supply or administration of medicines under group protocols (ie non-patient specific) could be clinically justified? Copy of the Consultation Letter 10113.How precise do the doctors' and dentists'instructions need to be, on (i)clinical assessment of individuals? (ii)contra-indications and interactions? referral for further opinion? (v) discharge procedures? 14.What (a) understanding of principles of clinical assessment, (b) other core competencies, (c) special training should professionals have before they can accept responsibility for the supply and administration of medicines? Does administration under group protocols raise any fundamentally new issues of clinical responsibility?Review of Prescribing, Supply & Administration of Medicines - Final Report 102Annex F: Circulation List and List of Respondents Distribution of Consultation Letter Academy of Medical Royal Colleges Ambulance Service Association Ambulance Service Institute Association for Quality in Healthcare Association of British Pharmaceutical Industries Association of Chief Chiropody Officers Association of Community Health Councils of England and Wales Association of National Specialists in Scotland Association of Nurse Prescribing Association of Optometrists Association of Private Hospital Pharmacists Association of Professional Ambulance Personnel British Association for Immediate Care British Dental Association British Dental Association Community Dental Services Group (Wales) British Dental Association Hospital Group (Wales) British Dental Association University Teachers Group (Wales) British Diabetic Association British Dietetics Association British Health Care Association British Medical Association British Oncology Pharmacy Association British Orthoptic Society British Psychological Society British Society of Clinical Pharmacologists Carers National Association Central Consultants and Specialists Committee of the British Medical Association Chartered Society of Physiotherapists Chief Pharmacists of NHS Trusts in England & Wales College of Occupational TherapistsC i rculation List and List of Respondents 103College of Optometrists College of Pharmacy Practice College of Radiographers Community & District Nursing Association Community Care Liaison Group Company Chemists Association Community Services Pharmacists Group Consumers Association Council for the Professions Supplementary to Medicine Council of Europe Committee of Experts on Pharmaceutical Questions Department for Education and Employment Directors of Pharmaceutical Public Health (Wales) Directors of Pharmaceutical Services of Boards (NI) Directors of Pharmaceutical Services of Trust Hospitals (NI) Dispensing Doctors Association English National Board of Nursing,Midwifery & Health Visiting Faculty of Accident &Emergency Medicine Faculty of Dental Surgery (Royal College of Surgeons of England) Faculty of General Dental Practitioners -

This annex seeks merely to convey the main weight of opinion on each of the questions posed in the consultation letter . General issues Q1What valuable features of the cur rent arrangements [for prescription, supply and administration of medicines] need to be retained? What features could be improved? What features are obsolete and should be discarded? What inconsistencies and anomalies are there, and how could these be removed? Valuable features of the current system which should be retained or enhanced included: vthe clear legal framework, including the separation of medicines into POM, P and GSL categories; vthe separation of prescribing from supply and administration (strongly supported in the areas covered by all 4 sub-groups); vthe coordination of care by a single professional, usually the GP; vthe pharmacist's role in providing information and advice both to patients and to other professionals. Features which needed to be improved included: vpatient choice and patient access; vcommunication between professionals, including better use of IT (strongly supported); vcommunications with patients. Features which respondents thought obsolete or in need of radical revision included: vrepeat prescribing/medicine review arrangements (strongly supported); vthe failure to use fully the skills of all professionals, eg in advising on appropriate medication, and the need for written endorsement of their prescribing advice by a second clinician (very strongly supported).Review of Prescribing, Supply & Administration of Medicines - Final Report 124Q2If change is desirable, what steps are needed to encourage successful change? Responses to this question reflected the overwhelming support for allowing some extensions to prescribing by new professionals (see Q5 below), and for clarification of the role of supply and administration under group protocol. Steps needed to encourage change included: vreview of the legislation; vnationally accredited education and training (strongly supported); vpilot schemes; vuse of integrated IT to ensure safe communication within the professional team. Specific issues (i) Prescribing Q3At present, it is usual for one health professional to assess/diagnose the patient's condition, choose the broad treatment strategy andalso take the detailed prescribing decision. Is this essential? Would a separate of diagnosis/assessment from the treatment decision (and/or a separation of the choice of the broad treatment strategy from the detailed prescribing decision) raise any unusual issues of clinical, legal and financial accountability? Responders were split on this issue. Aminority felt that the traditional model was more \"holistic\" and preferable (for some respondents essential) on grounds of patient safety, clear legal and financial accountability, and patient convenience. The majority however felt that models in which detailed prescribing was carried out by a second professional, after an initial assessment and broad choice of treatment by a first, were acceptable. Possible advantages mentioned included the use of specialist skills (eg pharmacology) in the prescribing decision, and greater time for the second professional to discuss the prescribing choice with the patient, resulting in better concordance. Q4Is it always necessary to establish a full a prioridiagnosis and assessment of the patient' s condition, or are there circumstances in which a more limited assessment, within a relatively limited range of alternatives, would be sufficient without compromising patient safety? Again responders were split. Aminority felt that a full diagnosis was necessary before prescribing, but the majority view was that this was not always practicable (especially in emergency situations) and that prescribing on the basis of a more limited, symptomatic assessment was acceptable given various safeguards including: vworking within clear protocols; vrecognition of limits of competence;S u m m a r y of Main Points Raised in Response to Consultation 125vsharing of information by appropriate use of IT . Q5How far would it be desirable/practicable to extend education and training of particular professional groups to enable them to prescribe for specificconditions from a restricted formulary? What professional groups should be considered for this kind of limited prescribing role? In each case, how far would this build on existing skills and competencies and how far would additional training be needed? There was overwhelming support for this proposal, in the responses seen by all 4 subgroups. Possible professional groups to be considered for prescribing included: vspecialist nurses (eg nurses in diabetic and dermatology clinics, palliative care nurses, stoma nurses, tissue viability nurses, community psychiatric nurses, anaesthetic assistants, nurse practitioners); vmidwives; vpharmacists (eg pharmacists in secondary care, acute care, for lithium and anticoagulants); vdieticians, chiropodists and podiatrists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, optometrists, radiographers. Many respondents emphasised the need for prescribing to be related to core clinical competencies and for additional, nationally accredited training in prescribing issues, including pharmacology, monitoring and review, prescribing systems, and appraisal skills. Responses to sub-group D suggested that in some clinical situations in the mental health field, particularly those relating to compulsory treatment, it might not be desirable for non-medical members of the multiprofessional team to prescribe because of the potential effect on relationships with the patient. Q6Is it in principle acceptable for continuation of prescribing (with or without subsequent adjustment of the details of treatment) to be carried out by a different professional from the original prescriber? How far in practice would this differ from cur rent experiments in repeat dispensing (see Q11)? What are the implications for professional roles, responsibilities and accountability? Generally, respondents agreed that continuation prescribing could be safely carried out by a second professional, subject to safeguards such as: vadjusting medication within agreed protocols; vaccess to full records of the reason for the original prescribing decision;Review of Prescribing, Supply & Administration of Medicines - Final Report 126voccasional full review by the original prescriber . Some respondents felt that continuation prescribing of this kind could lead to an improvement in medicines management as compared to the actual practice of repeat prescribing in many busy GPpractices. Afew respondents, however, felt that repeat prescribing should wherever possible be carried out by the original prescriber . Q7Are there any circumstances in which the professional status of the prescriber could influence the patient's readiness a.to seek clinical advice, b.to accept that advice as authoritative? What are the implications for this review? Many respondents did not have strong views on this question, but a number commented that at present prescribing advice from doctors was more likely to be regarded as authoritative, though patients might be more ready to explain their health concerns to other professionals who were perceived as having more time available. Any extension of prescribing to other professionals would need to be supported by public information in order to establish their authority in the public's eyes. There are again special factors in the mental health field - see answer to Q5. Q8Is there any danger that an extension of the role of other health professionals in prescribing could lead to fragmentation of patient care? What could be done to ensure that the GP or other responsible doctor is still able to maintain an overview of the care of the patient? The dominant view that this was a potential problem but could be overcome by some or all of: vcontinued overview of patients by a lead professional (usually but not always identified as the GP); vbetter communication within the team, using IT solutions and/or patient-held records; vuse of district-wide protocols so that (eg) district nurses were not expected to operate to different clinical standards in different practices. Afew respondents thought that there was already considerable fragmentation, and that extended roles for other professionals might positively help. Respondents in the mental health area thought that communications between professionals in primary and secondary care could also be problematic, and saw the single patient record as the key to overcoming it.S u m m a r y of Main Points Raised in Response to Consultation 127(ii) Supply of medicines Q9It is usual practice for one professional (eg a doctor or dentist) to write a prescription, and for another (eg a pharmacist) to supply it or administer it (eg a nurse). How important is this traditional separation of roles, eg in relation to patient safety? With reference to specific examples, how far does this derive from a.the complementary skills of the two professionals concerned, b.the wish to improve safety in the administration of medicines (eg double checking of the prescribed dosage)? There was strong support on safety grounds for the traditional separation of functions, with almost equal numbers referring to the complementary skills of the two professions and to the need for double checking. Some respondents mentioned probity as an added reason for the separation. Only a few respondents felt that separation of functions was unnecessary or ineffective, or that it was not always practicable. Q10Under what circumstances might it be (i) desirable, or (ii) essential for the patient to be given a (possibly small) supply of the medicine prescribed at or immediately following the consultation (eg where there is a need for early treatment or for patient convenience)? What are the implications for professional roles and responsibilities? The general view was that there were a limited range of circumstances in primary care in which the initial prescriber (doctor or nurse) might need to give a small initial supply so that treatment could start without delay. Examples given included: vemergency contraception; therapy including nebulisers; vpsychiatric treatment when the patient was hesitant about starting treatment. Respondents agreed that safety, not patient convenience, should be the overriding consideration. Some respondents mentioned the need for clear local protocols on what medicines should be supplied and how, and for suitable supplies of \"starter packs\" purchased by the HA (on the Scottish model) rather than supplied for promotional reasons by the manufacturer .Review of Prescribing, Supply & Administration of Medicines - Final Report 128Aminority felt that any extension of emergency supply by the original prescriber should be resisted, and that it would be better to seek to improve access to out-of-hours pharmacy services. Some respondents mentioned the particular problems of supply and/or administration of emergency medicine at institutions like schools or residential homes. Q11 Would you wish to see a wider use of repeat dispensing (ie multiple dispensing under the professional oversight of a pharmacist following an assessment and prescription by a doctor)? The majority view was that wider use of repeat dispensing by pharmacists (or repeat supply by nurses) would be convenient to patients and result in fewer medication errors and less waste, provided that: vthe process was supported by good IT links, and/or patients registered with a single pharmacist; vthere were regular reviews by the original prescriber . Areas where this model might be useful included: vuse of strong analgesics; vchronic conditions; vcommunity nurse supply of dressing packs, catheters and enemas; vispensing in residential or nursing homes; vdispensing to patients at risk of overdosing themselves. Aminority were not in favour, arguing that repeat dispensing could increase the risk of wastage or polypharmacy, or that GPs needed to have control since they were responsible for their drug budgets. Some respondents, while generally sympathetic, suggested that repeat prescribing by pharmacists under agreed protocol might be a better model; others felt that remuneration for pharmacists would need to be reviewed to avoid incentives to abuse. (iii) Supply or administration of medicines under protocol Q12Are there any circumstances in which supply or administration of medicines under group protocols (ie non-patient specific) could be clinically justified?S u m m a r y of Main Points Raised in Response to Consultation 129Analysing the response to this question was made more difficult because some respondents did not appear to distinguish clearly between limited prescribing and supply/administration under group protocol. However, the dominant view was that supply/administration under group protocol could be a useful and acceptable model in certain limited circumstances, generally: iwhen treatment needed to be initiated very quickly, eg vpain relief (eg administration of pethidine by (eg administration of salbutamol by paramedics); vin intensive care; vin A&E, eg treatment for injury, shock or anaphylaxis; or iiwhen prescribing for individual patients was unwieldy or impracticable (or could reduce effective enemas; vcare in nursing or residential homes. Advocates of the use of group protocols stressed the need for those working within them to have appropriate training, in particular to be able to recognise when to refer for help in circumstances outside the scope of the protocol. Anumber of respondents were not convinced that group protocols were clinically safe or necessary. Some felt that, in primary care settings, prescribing (possibly \"dependent prescribing\" as defined in our main report) was a better model than supply under group protocol.Review of Prescribing, Supply & Administration of Medicines - Final Report 130Q13How precise do the doctors'and dentists'instructions need to be, eg on (i) clinical assessment of individuals? (ii)contra-indications doses? (iv)referral for further opinion? (v)discharge procedures? The majority view was that protocols should be very specific and clear .Aminority felt that the protocol should leave some room to the clinical judgement of the health professional concerned. Some respondents pointed out that pharmacists already manage discharge medication prescribing in many hospitals. Q14What (a) understanding of principles of clinical assessment, (b) other core competencies, (c) special training should professionals have before they can accept responsibility for the supply and administration of medicines? Does administration under group protocols raise any fundamentally new issues of clinical responsibility? Respondents agreed that training course would need to be agreed and accredited nationally . Core elements would include: vclinical vlegislation. Some that training should be interdisciplinary, to promote team- working.S u m m a r y of Main Points Raised in Response to Consultation 131Annex H: Related Issues for Consideration by Other Groups Among the helpful comments received in response to the consultation undertaken by the Review Team, a number raised issues which are broadly related to the prescribing, supply and administration of medicines but which fell outside the Review's terms of reference. Anumber of these seemed to the Team to be particularly significant. These are listed below and are commended to the relevant parts of government for furtherconsideration. Issues for the Health Departments iContinuing Professional Development should as far as possible be multidisciplinary, and fragmented funding arrangements which inhibit this should be reviewed. iiThe processes for determining which new medicines, dressing and appliances are prescribable on the NHS should be reviewed to make them more consistent, responsive and transparent. Arrangements for introduction of new treatments should take account of evidence on cost-effectiveness as well as the traditional criteria of safety, efficacy and quality. iiiRemuneration for pharmacists and dispensing doctors should be reviewed in order to remove anomalies and perverse incentives. ivHealth Departments should review the arrangements in the private sector for routine monitoring of prescribing data and clinical audit of prescribing practice, and should consider what further safeguards may be needed to ensure the safety of patients. Issue for the Health Departments and the Home Office vThe Care Programme Approach (see Glossary) should be introduced into non-NHS establishments, including prisons, and should be further promoted throughout all aspects of mental health care. Issues for the Health Departments, the Home Office and the Department for Education and Employment viArrangements for the administration of medicines by staff other than qualified health professionals, for instance in non-NHS establishments such as schools, prisons, or Local Authority residential homes, should be reviewed.Review of Prescribing, Supply & Administration of Medicines - Final Report 132Issues for the Home Office viiArrangements for the immediate supply of medicines in prisons should be reviewed. viiiArrangements for the transfer of clinical information (including medicines regimes) when individuals are transferred between prison medical services and other care agencies should be improved.Related Issues for Consideration by Other Gr o u p s 133 "}
