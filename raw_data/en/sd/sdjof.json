Donning a bright-red lip can make you feel sexy. Similarly, wearing perfume makes you smell good\u2014which, in turn, will make you feel elegant. What's more is that having a signature scent can also make your presence known upon entering a room. However, [traditional perfume may contain ingredients that can be toxic to your health](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7825391/) and even the environment. That said, you don't have to settle for a traditional perfume. In fact, the market certainly has non-toxic perfume brands that I strongly suggest you consider. For instance, some perfumes have a lot of irritants and synthetic chemicals in them that aren't really servicing your skin. In fact, in a lot of cases, these ingredients can dry your skin out. Considering that you're applying perfume to your neck (and around your face), you probably want to consider more natural options. As far as the environment, some of the synthetic properties of non-natural fragrances aren't biodegradable. Because of that, they also wreak havoc on aquatic life. Plus, some of those things also bring down the air quality indoors. But just like we rounded up the [best non-toxic sunscreens](https://thedaleydose.com/best-non-toxic-sunscreens/) (which are also better for your skin and the environment), we took the liberty of listing the best non-toxic perfume.

First of all, the bottle is extremely chic and in a color that matches the amber scent. The base notes also include vanilla, cedarwood, and musk. Though it's definitely a superior scent, it's on the pricey side at $108 for 1.7 ounces.

When we categorize scents as \"masculine\" or \"feminine,\" we don't mean to say that it's the \"for men\" or \"for women.\" What we mean is that one is musky and one is floral.
